    "abstract": "The regeneration of bioavailable phosphate from immobilised organophosphorus represents a key process in the global phosphorus cycle and is facilitated by enzymes known as phosphatases. Most bacteria possess at least one of three major phosphatases, known as PhoA, PhoX and PhoD, whose activity is optimal under alkaline conditions. The production and activity of these three phosphatase families is negatively regulated by phosphate availability and thus these enzymes play a major role in scavenging phosphorus only during times of phosphate scarcity. Here, we reveal a previously overlooked phosphate-insensitive phosphatase, PafA, prevalent in Bacteroidetes, which is highly abundant in nature and represents a major route for the remineralisation of phosphate in the environment. Using Flavobacterium johnsoniae as the model, we reveal PafA is highly active towards phosphomonoesters. Unlike other major phosphatases, PafA is fully functional in the presence of its metabolic product, phosphate, and is essential for growth on phosphorylated carbohydrates as a sole carbon source. PafA, which is constitutively produced under all growth conditions tested, rapidly remineralises phosphomonoesters producing significant quantities of bioavailable phosphate that can cross feed into neighbouring cells. pafA is both abundant and highly expressed in the global ocean and abundant in plant rhizospheres, highlighting a new and important enzyme in the global phosphorus cycle with applied implications for agriculture as well as biogeochemical cycling. We speculate PafA expands the metabolic niche of Bacteroidetes by enabling utilisation of abundant organophosphorus substrates in the presence of excess phosphate, when other microbes are rendered incapable.\n\nSignificance statementPhosphorus is an essential element for all life on Earth. Global primary production, and thus the ability for oceans and soils to drawdown atmospheric carbon dioxide, is in part controlled by the availability of inorganic phosphate. Likewise, global food production is also reliant on adequate supplies of phosphorus to both plants and animals. A major fraction of the total phosphorus pool exists as organic phosphorus, which requires mineralisation to phosphate prior to incorporation into cellular biomolecules. This important process is performed by enzymes known as phosphatases. Here, we reveal that the unique bacterial phosphatase, PafA, is a key player in the global phosphorus cycle and presents a major route for the regeneration of bioavailable phosphate required for both primary and secondary production.",

    "abstract": "Nanobubble (NB) technology has been hailed as a novel way to disinfect water. Previous studies suggested that when NBs collapse, they create shock waves that result in OH- free radicals, which can damage cells, including bacteria. In this study, we investigated, through a series of 11 experiments, the potential use of air nanobubbles (128 {+/-} 44 nm, mean {+/-} SD) to reduce the concentration of various pathogenic bacteria including Aeromonas hydrophila, A. veronii, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Streptococcus agalactiae under controlled, tank-based laboratory conditions. Despite the high number of nanobubbles continuously added to a relatively small volume of water in experimental tanks (50-100 L), we did not observe a consistent or significant decrease in bacteria that would control disease outbreaks. Although most of the experiments were conducted in fresh water on A. hydrophila, results were consistent across fresh and brackish water experiments, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and a range of nanobubble concentrations. This study suggests air nanobubbles on their own are inadequate to significantly reduce high levels of pathogenic bacteria in water. We propose to explore other gases for improving the disinfection properties of this technology.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAir nanobubbles did not sufficiently reduce the level of bacteria in laboratory experiments.",

    "abstract": "Melanin is a major virulence factor in pathogenic fungi that enhances the ability of fungal cells to resist immune clearance. Cryptococcus neoformans is an important human pathogenic fungus that synthesizes melanin from exogenous tissue catecholamine precursors during infection, but the type of melanin made in cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is unknown. We analyzed the efficacy of various catecholamines found in brain tissue in supporting melanization using animal brain tissue and synthetic catecholamine mixtures reflecting brain tissue proportions. Solid-state NMR spectra of the melanin pigment produced from such mixtures yielded more melanin than expected if only the preferred constituent dopamine had been incorporated, suggesting uptake of additional catecholamines. Probing the biosynthesis of melanin using radiolabeled catecholamines revealed that C. neoformans melanization simultaneously incorporated more than one catecholamine, implying that the pigment was polytypic in nature. Nonetheless, melanin derived from individual or mixed catecholamines had comparable ability to protect C. neoformans against ultraviolet light and oxidants. Our results indicate that melanin produced during infection differs depending on the catecholamine composition of tissue and that melanin pigment synthesized in vivo is likely to accrue from the polymerization of a mixture of precursors. From a practical standpoint our results strongly suggest that using dopamine as a polymerization precursor is capable of producing melanin pigment comparable to that produced during infection. On a more fundamental level our findings uncover additional structural complexity for natural cryptococcal melanin by demonstrating that pigment produced during human infection is likely to be composed of polymerized moieties derived from chemically different precursors.",

However, no photopharmacological tools are available for the invertebrate nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Here, we report a photochromic ligand, dithienylethene-imidacloprid (DitIMI), targeting invertebrate nAChR. We demonstrated that DitIMI has low spontaneous in vivo and in vitro activity but can be photoisomerized to a highly active closed-form. This photoisomerization can further be translated to photomodulation of neuron membrane potential and behavioral responses of living mosquito larvae and American cockroaches. Furthermore, we discovered that DitIMI is a specific reporter for fluorescence polarization based high-throughput screening of nAChR ligands.",

    "abstract": "Usher syndrome (USH) is the most common form of hereditary deafness-blindness in humans. USH is a complex genetic disorder, assigned to three clinical subtypes differing in onset, course, and severity, with USH1 being the most severe. Rodent USH1 models do not reflect the ocular phenotype observed in human patients to date; hence, little is known about the pathophysiology of USH1 in the human eye. One of the USH1 genes, USH1C, exhibits extensive alternative splicing and encodes numerous harmonin protein isoforms that function as scaffolds for organizing the USH interactome. RNA-seq analysis of human retinas uncovered harmonin_a1 as the most abundant transcript of USH1C. Bulk RNA-seq analysis and immunoblotting showed abundant expression of harmonin in Muller glia cells (MGCs) and retinal neurons. Furthermore, harmonin was localized in the terminal endfeet and apical microvilli of MGCs, presynaptic region (pedicle) of cones, and outer segments of rods as well as at adhesive junctions of MGCs and photoreceptors in the outer limiting membrane (OLM). Our data provide evidence for the interactions of harmonin with OLM molecules in photoreceptors (PRCs) and MGCs and rhodopsin in PRCs. Subcellular expression and colocalization of harmonin correlate with the clinical phenotype observed in USH1C patients. In addition, primary cilia defects in USH1C patient-derived fibroblasts could be reverted by the delivery of harmonin_a1 transcript isoform. Our data provide novel insights into PRC cell biology, USH1C pathophysiology, and for developing gene therapy treatment.",

    "abstract": "Most motile cilia have a stereotyped structure of nine microtubule outer doublets and a single central pair of microtubules. The central pair microtubules are surrounded by a set of proteins, termed the central pair apparatus. A specific kinesin, Klp1 projects from the central pair and contributes to ciliary motility in Chlamydomonas. The vertebrate orthologue, Kif9 is required for beating in mouse sperm flagella, but the mechanism of Kif9/Klp1 function remains poorly defined. Here, using Xenopus epidermal multiciliated cells, we show that Kif9 is necessary for ciliary motility as well as leads to defects in the distal localization of not only central pair proteins, but also radial spokes and dynein arms. In addition, single-molecule assays in vitro revealed that Xenopus Kif9 is a processive motor, though like axonemal dyneins it displays no processivity in ciliary axonemes in vivo. Thus, our data suggest that Kif9 plays both indirect and direct role in ciliary motility.",

    "abstract": "Irrigation schemes provide an ideal habitat for Anopheles mosquitoes particularly during the dry season. Reliable estimates of outdoor host-seeking behaviour are needed to assess the impact of vector control options and this is particularly the case for Anopheles arabiensis which displays a wide range of behaviours that circumvent traditional indoor-insecticide based control. In this study we compared the Host Decoy Trap (HDT) with the Human Landing Catch (HLC) and Suna trap in a repeated Latin square design in two villages on an irrigated sugar estate in southern Malawi. Over the course of 18 trapping nights we caught 379 female Anopheles, the majority of which were identified as An. arabiensis. Overall, the HDT and HLC caught a similar number of Anopheles per night with both methods catching significantly higher densities than the Suna trap across both villages. Regardless of the density of Anopheles mosquitoes in each village the HLC and HDT demonstrated broadly similar sampling efficacy. We conclude that the HDT is an effective sampling device for outdoor host seeking An. arabiensis in southern Malawi. The presence of An. arabiensis in irrigated lands during the dry season poses a challenge for ongoing indoor vector control efforts.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveOver 55% of mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC (MPS IIIC) patients have at least one allelic missense variant responsible for misfolding of heparan sulfate acetyl-CoA:-glucosaminide N- acetyltransferase (HGSNAT). These variants are potentially treatable with pharmacological chaperones, such as a competitive HGSNAT inhibitor, glucosamine. Since the constitutive HGSNAT knockout mice, we generated previously cannot be used to test such strategy in vivo, we generated a novel model, the HgsnatP304L strain, expressing misfolded mutant HGSNAT with human missense mutation Pro311Leu (Pro304Leu in the mouse enzyme).\n\nResultsHgsnatP304L mice present deficits in short-term (novel object recognition test) and working/spatial (Y-maze test) memory at 4 months of age, 2-4 months earlier than previously described gene-targeted Hgsnat-Geo mice, which lack HGSNAT protein. HgsnatP304L mice also show increased severity of synaptic deficits in CA1 neurons, and accelerated course of CNS pathology including neuronal storage of heparan sulfate, accumulation of misfolded proteins, increase of simple gangliosides, and neuroinflammation as compared with Hgsnat-Geo mice. Expression of misfolded human Pro311Leu HGSNAT protein in cultured hippocampal Hgsnat- Geo neurons aggravated reduction of synaptic proteins. Memory deficits and majority of pathological changes in the brain were rescued in mice receiving daily doses of oral glucosamine.\n\nInterpretationAltogether, our data for the first time demonstrate dominant-negative effects of the misfolded HGSNAT Pro304Leu variant and show that these effects are treatable by oral administration of glucosamine, suggesting that patients, affected with missense mutations preventing normal folding of the enzyme, could benefit from chaperone therapy.",

    "abstract": "Many animals use signals, such as vocalizations, to recognize familiar individuals. However, animals risk making recognition mistakes because the signal properties of different individuals often overlap due to within-individual variation in signal production. To understand the relationship between signal variation and decision rules for social recognition, we studied male golden rocket frogs, which recognize the calls of territory neighbors and respond less aggressively to a neighbors calls than to the calls of strangers. We quantified patterns of individual variation in acoustic properties of calls and predicted optimal discrimination thresholds using a signal detection theory model of receiver utility that incorporated signal variation, the payoffs of correct and incorrect decisions, and the rates of encounters with neighbors and strangers. We then experimentally determined thresholds for discriminating between neighbors and strangers using a habituation-discrimination experiment with territorial males in the field. Males required a threshold difference between 9% and 12% to discriminate between calls differing in temporal properties; this threshold matched those predicted by a signal detection theory model under ecologically realistic assumptions of infrequent encounters with strangers and relatively costly missed detections of strangers. We demonstrate empirically that receivers group continuous variation in vocalizations into discrete social categories and show that signal detection theory can be applied to investigate evolved decision rules.",

    "abstract": "Measuring tumour cell invasiveness through three-dimensional (3D) tissues, particularly at the single cell level, can provide important mechanistic understanding and assist in identifying therapeutic targets of tumour invasion. However, current experimental approaches, including standard in vitro invasion assays, have limited physiological relevance and offer insufficient insight about the vast heterogeneity in tumour cell migration through tissues. To address these issues, here we report on the concept of optical cellular micromotion, where digital holographic microscopy (DHM) is used to map the optical thickness fluctuations at sub-micron scale within single cells. These fluctuations are driven by the dynamic movement of subcellular structures including the cytoskeleton and inherently associated with the biological processes involved in cell invasion within tissues. We experimentally demonstrate that the optical cellular micromotion correlates with tumour cells motility and invasiveness both at the population and single cell levels. In addition, the optical cellular micromotion significantly reduced upon treatment with migrastatic drugs that inhibit tumour cell invasion. These results demonstrate that micromotion measurements can rapidly and non-invasively determine the invasive behaviour of single tumour cells within tissues, yielding a new and powerful tool to assess the efficacy of approaches targeting tumour cell invasiveness.\n\nSignificance StatementTumour cells invasion through tissues is a key hallmark of malignant tumour progression and its measurement is essential to unraveling biological processes and screening for new approaches targeting cell motility. To address the limitations of current approaches, we demonstrate that sub-micron scale mapping of the dynamic optical thickness fluctuations within single cells, referred to as optical cellular micromotion, correlates with their motility in ECM mimicking gel, both at the population and single cell levels. We anticipate that 3D optical micromotion measurement will provide a powerful new tool to address important biological questions and screen for new approaches targeting tumour cell invasiveness.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with patient demographics, lifestyle exposures and molecular alterations. However, it is not possible to determine which adenomas will progress to CRC, as ethically it is unacceptable to leave and follow adenomas. We hypothesised that certain lifestyle exposures at high levels could precondition exposed bowel tissue by changing and aging it, increasing the risks of deleterious DNA methylation and genetic alterations. We used a novel study design comparing adenomas with concurrent CRC (thus more likely exposed to deleterious lifestyle effects) to single adenomas in bowels with no history of CRC; we called these high (HR) and low-risk (LR) adenomas respectively.\n\nMethodsWe carried out a discovery and replication epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) on 106 HR and 111 LR adenomas, profiled with MethylationEPIC BeadChips. In order, to identify differentially methylated positions (DMP), regions (DMR), and DNAm (DNAmethylation) lifestyle exposures and risks, with adjustment for confounders, and gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment. Then, two open-source gene expression omnibus (GEO) validation datasets (52, 57 and 49, 48 HR and LR normal bowel tissues respectively) were analysed for these DNAm lifestyle exposures and risks, with adjustment for confounders.\n\nResultsOur EWAS found 5 Bonferroni significant DMPs with absolute delta betas [&ge;] 5%, and 14 significant DMRs with absolute mean DMR delta betas [&ge;] 5%, replicated in the GPX7, RGS3 and TMEM135 cancer-associated genes. DNAm high alcohol exposures were strongly associated with increased risk of HR adenomas (odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation (SD) = 2.16 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.55 - 3.09, p-value = 9.7 x 10-6)). In the validation datasets, DNAm high alcohol (ORperSD = 2.12 (95% CI 1.35 - 3.55, p-value = 2.0 x 10-3) and ORperSD = 1.79 (95% CI 1.14 - 2.96, p-value = 1.7 x 10-2)), and high body mass index (BMI) exposures (ORperSD = 1.72 (95% CI 1.13 - 2.73, p-value = 1.5 x 10-2)) were associated with increased risk of HR normal bowel tissues.\n\nConclusionsHigh alcohol and BMI exposures may precondition normal bowel tissues and adenomas for increased risk of DNA methylation alterations associated with CRC progression. The DNAm exposure signatures and our newly identified genes may be useful epigenetic biomarkers for CRC prevention.",

    "abstract": "The fate of pyruvate, which is modulated by the activity of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), is a defining metabolic feature in many cancers. Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are a genetically and metabolically heterogeneous cancer. Although MPC expression and activity differed between DLBCL subgroups, mitochondrial pyruvate was uniformly consumed by glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2) to support -ketoglutarate production as part of glutaminolysis. This led us to discover that glutamine exceeds pyruvate as a carbon source for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in DLBCLs. Furthermore, we found that MPC inhibition unexpectedly leads to decreased glutaminolysis, which is contrary to previous observations in other cell types.

We also have found that the metabolic profile of DLBCL cells in ECM is markedly different from cells in suspension environment.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by high drug resistance and poor prognosis. Novel therapeutic and stratification strategies are urgently needed. Here, we present an integration of in-depth genomic and transcriptomic characterization with drug screening and clinical outcome based on a catalogue of 51 patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) from resected PDAC. Known PDAC molecular subtypes and their prognostic value are conserved in organoids. Integration of transcriptomic and drug response profiles suggest a metabolism-mediated modulations of drug resistance. Copy number alterations on chromosome 13q and wild-type status of TP53 emerged as potential novel genomic biomarkers for sensitivity to 5-FU and oxaliplatin treatment, respectively. Functional testing of targeted drugs in PDOs revealed its additional value for genome-driven personalized oncology. Co-deletion of TP53/POLR2A increased vulnerability to RNA polymerase II inhibition, pointing to a promising target for personalized treatment in PDAC.\n\nSignificancePatient-derived PDAC organoids hold great promise as surrogate tumor models for personalized oncology. By integrating highly granular molecular, drug sensitivity and clinical data, we demonstrate that PDOs are valid models for molecular characterization and response prediction that also enable identification of novel drug sensitivity biomarkers and resistance mechanisms in PDAC.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial-Mesenchymal Plasticity (EMP) refers to reversible dynamic processes where cells can transition from epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) or from mesenchymal to epithelial (MET) phenotypes. Both these processes are modulated by multiple transcription factors acting in concert. While EMT-inducing transcription factors (TFs) - TWIST1/2, ZEB1/2, SNAIL1/2/3, GSC, FOXC2 - are well-characterized, the MET-inducing TFs are relatively poorly understood (OVOL1/2, GRHL1/2). Here, using mechanism-based mathematical modeling, we show that the transcription factor KLF4 can delay the onset of EMT by suppressing multiple EMT-TFs. Our simulations suggest that KLF4 overexpression can promote phenotypic shift toward a more epithelial state, an observation suggested by negative correlation of KLF4 with EMT-TFs and with transcriptomic based EMT scoring metrics in cancer cell lines. We also show that the influence of KLF4 in modulating EMT dynamics can be strengthened by its ability to inhibit cell-state transitions at an epigenetic level. Thus, KLF4 can inhibit EMT through multiple parallel paths and can act as a putative MET-TF. KLF4 associates with patient survival metrics across multiple cancers in a context-specific manner, highlighting the complex association of EMP with patient survival.",

    "abstract": "Plant plastids generate signals, including some derived from lipids, that need to be mobilized to effect signaling. We used informatics to discover potential plastid membrane proteins involved in microbial responses. Among these are proteins co-regulated with the systemic immunity component AZI1, a hybrid proline-rich protein (HyPRP) and HyPRP superfamily members. HyPRPs have a transmembrane domain, a proline-rich region (PRR) and a lipid transfer protein domain. The precise subcellular location(s) and function(s) is unknown for most HyPRP family members. As predicted by informatics, a subset of HyPRPs have a pool of protein that targets plastid outer envelope membranes (OEMs) via a mechanism that requires the PRR. Additionally, two HyPRPs may be associated with thylakoid membranes. Most of the plastid and non-plastid localized family members also have pools that localize to endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane or plasmodesmata. HyPRPs with plastid pools regulate, positively or negatively, systemic immunity against the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. HyPRPs also regulate the interaction with the plant growth promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 in the roots to influence colonization, root system architecture and/or biomass. Thus, HyPRPs have broad and distinct roles in immune, development and growth responses to microbes and reside at sites that may facilitate signal molecule transport.",

    "abstract": "Lymphatic vessels are often considered passive conduits that rapidly flush antigenic material, pathogens, and cells to draining lymph nodes. Recent evidence, however, suggests that lymphatic vessels actively regulate diverse processes from antigen transport to leukocyte trafficking and dietary lipid absorption. Here we tested the hypothesis that dermal lymphatic transport is dynamic and contributes to innate host defense during viral infection. We demonstrate that cutaneous vaccinia virus infection activates the tightening of lymphatic interendothelial junctions, termed zippering, in a VEGFA/VEGFR2-dependent manner. Both antibody-mediated blockade of VEGFA/VEGFR2 and lymphatic-specific deletion of Vegfr2 impaired lymphatic capillary zippering and increased fluid flux out of tissue. Strikingly, inhibition of lymphatic zippering allows viral dissemination to draining lymph nodes independent of dendritic cell migration and impairs CD8+ T cell priming. These data indicate that infection-induced dermal lymphatic capillary zippering is a context-dependent, active mechanism of innate host defense that limits interstitial fluid and virion flux and promotes protective, anti-viral CD8+ T cell responses.\n\nSummaryCutaneous infection with vaccinia virus induces VEGFR2-dependent dermal lymphatic capillary zippering. This tightening of lymphatic junctions exacerbates tissue edema, sequesters virus, and promotes anti-viral CD8+ T cell responses. Dermal lymphatic capillaries are therefore an active component of innate host defense.",

    "abstract": "Many cyanobacteria, which use light as an energy source via photosynthesis, show directional movement towards or away from a light source. However, the molecular and cell biological mechanisms for switching the direction of movement remain unclear. Here, we visualized type IV pilus-dependent cell movement in the rod-shaped thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vulcanus using optical microscopy at physiological temperature and light conditions. Positive and negative phototaxis were controlled on a short time scale of 1 min. The cells smoothly moved over solid surfaces towards green light, but the direction was switched to backward movement when we applied additional blue light illumination. The switching was mediated by three photoreceptors, SesA, SesB and SesC, which have cyanobacteriochrome photosensory domains and synthesis/degradation activity of the bacterial second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP). Our results suggest that the decision-making process for directional switching in phototaxis involves light-dependent changes in the cellular concentration of c-di-GMP. Furthermore, we reveal that rod-shaped cells can move perpendicular to the light vector, indicating that the polarity can be controlled not only by pole-to-pole regulation but also within-a-pole regulation. This study provides insights into previously undescribed rapid bacterial polarity regulation via second messenger signalling with high spatial resolution.",

Many variant CLIP protocols have been developed to improve the efficiency and convenience of cDNA library preparation. Here we describe an improved individual nucleotide resolution CLIP protocol (iiCLIP), which can be completed within 4 days from UV crosslinking to libraries for sequencing. For benchmarking, we directly compared PTBP1 iiCLIP libraries with the iCLIP2 protocol produced under standardised conditions, and with public eCLIP and iCLIP PTBP1 data. We visualised enriched motifs surrounding the identified crosslink positions and RNA maps of these crosslinks around the alternative exons regulated by PTBP1. Notably, motif enrichment was higher in iiCLIP and iCLIP2 in comparison to public eCLIP and iCLIP, and we show how this impacts the specificity of RNA maps. In conclusion, iiCLIP is technically convenient and efficient, and enables production of highly specific datasets for identifying RBP binding sites.",

    "abstract": "The Six1 transcription factor is implicated in controlling the development of several tissue types, notably skeletal muscle. Six1 also contributes to muscle metabolism and its activity is associated with the fast-twitch, glycolytic phenotype. Six1 regulates the expression of certain genes of the fast muscle program by directly stimulating their transcription or indirectly acting through a long non-coding RNA. Under the hypothesis that additional mechanisms of action might be at play, a combined analysis of gene expression profiling and genome-wide location analysis data was performed. The Slc16a10 gene, encoding the thyroid hormone transmembrane transporter MCT10, was identified as a gene with a transcriptional enhancer directly bound by Six1 and requiring Six1 activity for full expression in adult mouse tibialis anterior, a predominantly fast-twitch muscle. Of the various thyroid hormone transporters, MCT10 mRNA was found to be the most abundant in skeletal muscle, and to have a stronger expression in fast-twitch compared to slow-twitch muscle groups. Loss-of-function of MCT10 in the tibialis anterior recapitulated the effect of Six1 on the expression of fast-twitch muscle genes and led to lower activity of a thyroid hormone receptor-dependent reporter gene. These results shed light on the molecular mechanisms controlling the tissue expression profile of MCT10 and identify modulation of the thyroid hormone signaling pathway as an additional mechanism by which Six1 influences skeletal muscle metabolism.",

Extrusion is a dynamic process of cohesin loading, loop extension and release. Cohesin release is mediated by WAPL. Loss of WAPL leads to the formation of longer loops and counters compartmentalization. The dynamics of these changes in chromosome organization have been unclear. We have used acute depletion of WAPL to show that within six hours cohesin accumulates at CTCF-bound loop anchors and extended loops are formed. When we deplete WAPL and CTCF simultaneously, new loops are formed between active genes. Surprisingly, active gene clustering is independent of cohesin. Stabilization of cohesin on chromatin leads to a decrease in compartmentalization, which is rapidly restored by depletion of cohesin. Our analyses show that loop extrusion counters compartmentalization and plays a central role in many aspects of chromosome organization.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LICohesin accumulates at CTCF-mediated chromatin loop anchors following WAPL depletion.\nC_LIO_LIActively transcribed genes form long-range gene clusters independent of the cohesin complex.\nC_LIO_LIPlumes are a novel architectural feature of juxtaposed DNA formed by cohesin at open chromatin islands.\nC_LIO_LIChromosome compartmentalization can be uncoupled from nuclear lamina interactions.\nC_LI",

Despite extensive admixture, all African cattle possess taurine mitochondrial haplotypes, even populations with significant zebu biparental and male uniparental nuclear ancestry. This has been interpreted as the result of a human-mediated dispersal ultimately stemming from zebu bulls imported from South Asia during the last three millennia. Here we assess whether ancestry at mitochondrially-targeted nuclear genes in African admixed cattle is impacted by mitonuclear functional interactions. Using high-density SNP data, we find evidence for mitonuclear coevolution across hybrid African cattle populations with a significant increase of taurine ancestry at mitochondrially-targeted nuclear genes.

Although PE can be split into two fragments and delivered using dual adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), choice of split sites within Cas9 - which affects editing efficiency - is limited due to the large size of PE. Furthermore, the potential effect of overexpressing RT in mammalian cells is largely unknown. Here, we developed a compact PE with complete deletion of the RNase H domain of reverse transcriptase (RT), which showed comparable editing to full-length PE. Using compact PE, we tested the effect of 4 different Cas9 split sites and found that the Glu 573 split site supports robust editing (up to 93% of full-length PE). The compact PE, but not PE2, abolished its binding to eRF1 and showed minimal effect on stop codon readthrough, which therefore might reduce the effects on protein biosynthesis. This study identifies a safe and efficient compact PE2 that enables flexible split-PE design to facilitate efficient delivery in vivo and advance the utility of prime editing.",

To overcome this limitation, we analysed 10,776,212 protein sequences derived from seven MGE databases to compile a comprehensive database of 6,140 manually curated protein families that are linked to the \"life cycle\" (integration, excision, replication/recombination/repair, transfer, and stability/defense) of all major classes of bacterial MGEs.

    "abstract": "The success of glycoprotein-based drugs in various disease treatments has become widespread. Frequently, therapeutic glycoproteins exhibit a heterogeneous array of glycans that are intended to mimic human glycopatterns. While immunogenic responses to biologic drugs are uncommon, enabling exquisite control of glycosylation with minimized microheterogeneity would improve their safety, efficacy and bioavailability. Therefore, close attention has been drawn to the development of glycoengineering strategies to control the glycan structures. With the accumulation of knowledge about the glycan biosynthesis enzymes, enzymatic glycan remodeling provides a potential strategy to construct highly ordered glycans with improved efficiency and biocompatibility. In this study, we quantitatively evaluate more than 30 enzymes for glycoengineering immobilized immunoglobulin G, an impactful glycoprotein class in the pharmaceutical field. We demonstrate successive glycan remodeling in a solid-phase platform, which enabled IgG glycan harmonization into a series of complex-type N-glycoforms with high yield and efficiency while retaining native IgG binding affinity.\n\nSignificanceGlycosylation plays critical functional and structural roles in protein biology. However, our understanding of how discrete glycan structures affect protein behaviors remains extremely limited due to the naturally occurring microheterogeneity. Through the use of characterized glycoengineering enzyme combination, we report a solid-phase glycan remodeling (SPGR) platform that enables efficient IgG glycan harmonization into several glycoforms of interest with high biocompatibility to the substrates. It provides an efficient strategy to screen the biological behavior of distinct glycoforms, building a fundamental understanding of glycosylation.",

    "abstract": "{gamma}{delta}T cells are unconventional T cells particularly abundant in mucosal tissues that play an important role in tissue surveillance and homeostasis. {gamma}{delta}T cell activation is mediated by the T cell receptor composed of {gamma} and {delta} chains, as well as activating receptors for stress-induced ligands, such as NKG2D. Contrary to the well-established anti-tumor function of {gamma}{delta}T cells, recent studies have shown that {gamma}{delta}T cells can promote tumor development in certain contexts. However, the mechanisms leading to this diseasepromoting role remain poorly understood. Here, we show that mice lacking {gamma}{delta}T cells survive longer in a mouse model of intestinal cancer, further supporting their pro-tumoral role. In a surprising conceptual twist, we found that these pro-tumor {gamma}{delta}T cells are regulated by NKG2D signaling, a receptor normally associated with cancer cell killing. Germline deletion of Klrk1, the gene encoding NKG2D, reduced the frequency of {gamma}{delta}T cells in the tumor microenvironment and delayed tumor progression. We further show that blocking NKG2D reduces the capability of {gamma}{delta}T cells to produce IL-17A in the pre-metastatic lung and that co-culture of lung T cells with NKG2D ligand-expressing tumor cells specifically increases the frequency of {gamma}{delta}T cells. Together, these data support the hypothesis that in a tumor microenvironment where NKG2D ligands are constitutively expressed, {gamma}{delta}T cells accumulate in an NKG2D-dependent manner and drive tumor progression by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17A.",

    "abstract": "The gut visceral musculature plays essential roles in not only moving substances through the lumen but also maintaining the function and physiology of the gut. Although the development of the visceral musculature has been studied in multiple model organisms, how it degenerates is poorly understood. Here, we employ the Drosophila midgut as a model to demonstrate that the visceral musculature is disrupted by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as aging, feeding, chemical-induced tissue damage, and oncogenic transformation in the epithelium. Notably, we define four prominent visceral musculature disruption phenotypes, which we refer as  sprout,  discontinuity,  furcation, and  crossover of the longitudinal muscle. Given that the occurrence of these phenotypes is increased during aging and under various stresses, we propose that these phenotypes can be used as quantitative readouts of deterioration of the visceral musculature. Intriguingly, administration of a tissue-damaging chemical dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced similar visceral musculature disruption phenotypes in zebrafish larvae, indicating that ingestion of a tissue-damaging chemical can disrupt the visceral musculature in a vertebrate as well. Our study provides insights into the deterioration of the gut visceral musculature and lays a groundwork for investigating the underlying mechanisms in Drosophila as well as other animals.",

    "abstract": "MotivationPrediction of protein stability change upon mutation ({Delta}{Delta}G) is crucial for facilitating protein engineering and understanding of protein folding principles. Robust prediction of protein folding free energy change requires the knowledge of protein three-dimensional (3D) structure. Unfortunately, protein 3D structure is not always available. In this case, one can still predict the protein stability change by constructing a homology model of the protein; however, the accuracy of homology model-based {Delta}{Delta}G predictions is unknown. The perspectives of using 3D structures of the best templates are also unclear.\n\nResultsTo investigate these questions, we used the most popular and accurate publicly available tools: FoldX for stability change prediction and I-Tasser for homology modeling. We found that both homology models and best templates worsen the {Delta}{Delta}G prediction, with best templates performing 1.5 times better than homology models. For AlphaFold models, we also found that the best templates seem to outperform protein models. Our findings imply using the 3D structures of the best templates for {Delta}{Delta}G prediction if the 3D protein structure is unavailable.\n\nContactd.ivankov@skoltech.ru",
