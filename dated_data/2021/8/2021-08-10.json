    "abstract": "Aberrant expression of MYC family members predicts poor clinical outcome in many human cancers. Oncogenic MYC profoundly alters metabolism and mediates an antioxidant response to maintain redox balance. Here we show that MYC induces massive lipid peroxidation upon depletion of cysteine, the rate-limiting amino acid for glutathione biosynthesis and sensitizes cells to ferroptosis, an oxidative, non-apoptotic and irondependent type of cell death. In MYCN-amplified childhood neuroblastoma, MYCN mediates resistance to ferroptosis by activating transsulfuration of methionine to cysteine. MYCN may contribute to spontaneous tumor regression in low-risk neuroblastomas by promoting ferroptosis in cells with epigenetically silenced cystathionine-beta-synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme for transsulfuration. We identified enzymes and antiporter proteins crucial to ferroptotic escape, providing multiple previously unknown sites that may be acted on therapeutically.",

    "abstract": "Lateral transfer of mitochondria occurs in many physiological and pathological conditions. Given that mitochondria provide essential energy for cellular activities, mitochondrial transfer is currently thought to promote the rescue of damaged cells. We report that mitochondrial transfer occurs between macrophages and breast cancer cells, leading to increased cancer cell proliferation. Unexpectedly, transferred macrophage mitochondria are dysfunctional, lacking mitochondrial membrane potential. Rather than performing essential mitochondrial activities, transferred mitochondria accumulate reactive oxygen species which activates ERK signaling, indicating that transferred mitochondria act as a signaling source that promotes cancer cell proliferation. We also demonstrate that pro-tumorigenic M2-like macrophages exhibit increased mitochondrial transfer to cancer cells. Collectively, our findings reveal how mitochondrial transfer is regulated and leads to sustained functional changes in recipient cells.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryLateral transfer of macrophage mitochondria acts as a ROS signaling source, regulating cancer cell proliferation through ERK signaling.",

Therefore, tracing of integration sites (IS) leads to misquantification of the true clonal spectrum and limits safety considerations in GT.\n\nHence, we use correlations between repeated measurements of IS abundances to estimate their mutual similarity and identify clusters of co-occurring IS, for which we assume a clonal origin. We evaluate the performance, robustness and specificity of our methodology using clonal simulations. The reconstruction methods, implemented and provided as an R-package, are further applied to experimental clonal mixes and to a preclinical model of hematopoietic GT.\n\nOur results demonstrate that clonal reconstruction from IS data allows to overcome systematic biases in the clonal quantification as an essential prerequisite for the assessment of safety and long-term efficacy of GT involving integrative vectors.",

However, a composite understanding of the histidyl dipeptide mediated responses in the heart are lacking. We performed multilayer omics in the cardio specific Carns overexpressing mice, showing higher myocardial levels of histidyl dipeptides lead to extensive changes in microRNAs that could target the expression of contractile proteins and enzymes involved in {beta}-fatty acid oxidation and citric acid cycle (TCA). Similarly, global proteomics showed contractile function, fatty acid degradation and TCA cycle, pathways were enriched in the CarnsTg heart. Parallel with these changes, free fatty acids, and TCA intermediate-succinic acid were lower under aerobic and significantly attenuated under anaerobic conditions in the CarnsTg heart. Integration of multiomics data shows {beta}-fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle exhibit correlative changes at all three levels in CarnsTg heart, suggesting histidyl dipeptides are critical regulators of myocardial structure, function and energetics.",

We explore this in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, visual deprivation, genetics, and functional imaging. We find that vision selectively drives the specification of glutamatergic cell types in upper layers (L) (L2/3/4), while deeper-layer glutamatergic, GABAergic, and non-neuronal cell types are established prior to eye opening. L2/3 cell types form an experience-dependent spatial continuum defined by the graded expression of [~]200 genes, including regulators of cell adhesion and synapse formation. Vision-dependent regulation of one of these genes, encoding the inhibitory synaptic cell adhesion molecule IGSF9b, is required for the normal development of binocular responses in L2/3. In summary, vision preferentially regulates the development of upper-layer glutamatergic cell types through the regulation of cell type-specific gene expression programs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe dopamine system contributes to a multitude of functions ranging from reward and motivation to learning and movement control, making it a key component in goal-directed behavior. Altered dopaminergic function is observed in neurological and psychiatric conditions. Numerous factors have been proposed to influence dopamine function, but due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous data analysis methods in previous studies their specific and joint contributions remain unresolved.\n\nMETHODSIn this cross-sectional register-based study we investigated how age, sex, body mass index (BMI), as well as cerebral hemisphere and regional volume influence striatal type 2 dopamine receptor (D2R) availability in the human brain. We analyzed a large historical dataset (n=156, 120 males and 36 females) of [11C]raclopride PET scans performed between 2004 and 2018.\n\nRESULTSStriatal D2R availability decreased through age for both sexes and was higher in females versus males throughout age. BMI and striatal D2R availability were weakly associated. There was no consistent lateralization of striatal D2R. The observed effects were independent of regional volumes. These results were validated using two different spatial normalization methods, and the age and sex effects also replicated in an independent sample (n=135).\n\nCONCLUSIONSD2R density is dependent on age and sex, which may contribute to the vulnerability of neurological and psychiatric conditions involving altering D2R expression.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCytoskeletal remodelling plays a pivotal role in the establishment of neuronal connectivity during development and in plasticity in adults. Mutations in the cytoskeleton regulatory protein Formin-2 (Fmn2) are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders like intellectual disability, though its function in neuronal morphogenesis has not been characterised in vivo.\n\nResultsHere we develop a loss-of-function model for fmn2b, the zebrafish orthologue of Fmn2, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. fmn2b mutants display motor deficits starting from the earliest motor responses in the embryo. We find that fmn2b is expressed in spinal motor neurons and its loss reduces motor neuron innervation of the axial muscles without affecting myotome integrity. The translocation of caudal primary (CaP) motor neuron outgrowth is compromised in fmn2b mutants, while rostral primary (RoP) motor neurons have missing soma or stall at the horizontal myoseptum. Strikingly, axon collateral branching of the motor neurons is severely compromised and results in reduced synaptic coverage of the myotome. Rescue experiments identify the requirement for Fmn2-mediated actin nucleation for motor neuron outgrowth and arborisation.\n\nConclusionsThe zebrafish loss-of-function model of Fmn2 reveals the specific requirement of F-actin polymerisation by Fmn2 in neuromuscular development. It also underscores the role of Fmn2 in motor neuropathies, especially as a proportion of individuals harbouring mutations in Fmn2 present with hypotonia.",

    "abstract": "IntroductoryFiloviruses are prime examples of emerging human pathogens that are transmitted to humans by zoonotic spillover events. Since their initial discovery, filovirus outbreaks have occured with increasing frequency and intensity. There is an urgent need to better understand their enzootic ecology and pathogenic potential, given recent zoonotic virus spillover events including the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic. Several novel filoviruses have been discovered with a markedly wider geographic distribution than previously described. One of these novel filoviruses, Lloviu virus (LLOV), was first identified in 2002 in Schreibers bats (Miniopterus schreibersii) in Spain, Portugal, and southern France. Subsequently, in 2016, LLOV was detected during the passive monitoring of bats in Hungary.\n\nHere we report the first isolation of infectious Lloviu virus; from the blood of an asymptomatic Schreibers bat, subsequently cultivated in the Miniopterus sp. kidney cell line SuBK12-08. We also show that LLOV is able to infect monkey and human cells, suggesting that LLOV might have spillover potential. We performed a multi-year surveillance of LLOV and detected LLOV RNA in both deceased and asymptomatic live animals as well as in coupled ectoparasites from the families Nycteribiidae and Ixodidae. We present data on the natural infection and seropositivity of Schreibers bats and provide novel LLOV genomic sequence information from a bat host and an arthropod parasite. Our data support the role of bats, specifically Miniopterus schreibersii as natural reservoirs for the LLOV filovirus in Europe. We also suggest that bat-associated parasites might play a role in the natural ecology of filoviruses in temperate climate regions compared to filoviruses in the tropics. These results raise the possibility of cross-species transmission events via bat-human interactions.",

    "abstract": "Parasitism by bacteriophages has led to the evolution of a variety of defense mechanisms in their host bacteria. However, it is unclear what factors lead to specific defenses being deployed upon phage infection. To explore this question, we exposed the bacterial fish pathogen Flavobacterium columnare to its virulent phage V156 in the presence of a eukaryotic host signal (mucin). All tested conditions led to some level of innate immunity, but the presence of mucin led to a dramatic increase in CRISPR spacer acquisition, especially in low nutrient conditions where over 60% of colonies had obtained at least one new spacer. Additionally, we show that the presence of a competitor bacterium further increases CRISPR spacer acquisition in F. columnare. These results suggest that ecological factors are important in determining defense strategies against phages, and that the concentration of phages on metazoan surfaces may select for the diversification of bacterial immune systems.",

    "abstract": "Typhoid toxin is an essential virulence factor for Salmonella Typhi, the cause of typhoid fever in humans. This toxin has an unusual biology in that it is produced by Salmonella Typhi only when located within host cells. Once synthesized, the toxin is secreted to the lumen of the Salmonella-containing vacuole from where it is transported to the extracellular space by vesicle carrier intermediates. Here we report the identification of the typhoid toxin sorting receptor and the cellular machinery that packages the toxin into vesicle carriers, and exports it to the extracellular space. We found that the cation- independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor serves as typhoid toxin sorting receptor and that the coat protein COPII and the GTPase Sar1 mediate its packaging into vesicle carriers. Formation of the typhoid toxin carriers requires the specific environment of the Salmonella Typhi-containing vacuole, which is determined by the activities of specific effectors of its type III protein secretion systems. We also found that Rab11B and its interacting protein Rip11 control the intracellular transport of the typhoid toxin carriers, and the SNARE proteins VAMP7, SNAP23, and Syntaxin 4 their fusion to the plasma membrane. Typhoid toxins cooption of specific cellular machinery for its transport to the extracellular space illustrates the remarkable adaptation of an exotoxin to exert its function in the context of an intracellular pathogen.",

Here we exploit DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair to develop two novel strategies that install precise genomic insertions using an SpCas9 nuclease-based prime editor (PEn). We first demonstrate that PEn coupled to a regular prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) efficiently promotes short genomic insertions through a homology-dependent DSB repair mechanism. While PEn editing lead to increased levels of by-products, it rescued pegRNAs that performed poorly with a nickase-based prime editor. We also present a small molecule approach that yielded increased product purity of PEn editing. Next, we developed a homology-independent PEn editing strategy by engineering a single primed insertion gRNA (springRNA) which installs genomic insertions at DSBs through the non-homologous end joining pathway (NHEJ). Lastly, we show that PEn-mediated insertions at DSBs prevent Cas9-induced large chromosomal deletions and provide evidence that continuous Cas9-mediated cutting is one of the mechanisms by which Cas9-induced large deletions arise. Altogether, this work expands the current prime editing toolbox by leveraging distinct DNA repair mechanisms including NHEJ, which represents the primary pathway of DSB repair in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "NIN is one of the most important root nodule symbiotic genes as it is required for both infection and nodule organogenesis in legume. Unlike most legumes with a sole NIN gene, there are four putative NIN genes in soybean (Glycine max). Whether and how these orthologs NIN genes contribute to soybean-rhizobia symbiotic interaction remain unknown. In this study, we found that all four GmNIN genes are induced by rhizobia, and that conserved CE and CYC binding motifs in their promoter regions are required for their expression in the nodule formation process. By generation of multiplex Gmnin mutants, we found that Gmnin1a nin2a nin2b triple mutant and Gmnin1a nin1b nin2a nin2b quadruple mutant displayed similar defects in rhizobia infection and root nodule formation, Gmnin2a nin2b produced less nodules but displayed hyper infection phenotype than wild type, while a Gmnin1a nin1b double mutant nodulated as wild type. Overexpression of GmNIN1a, GmNIN1b, GmNIN2a, and GmNIN2b reduced nodule numbers after rhizobia inoculation, with GmNIN1b overexpression having the weakest effect. In addition, overexpression of GmNIN1a, GmNIN2a, or GmNIN2b, but not GmNIN1b, produced malformed pseudo-nodule like structures without rhizobia inoculation. In conclusion, GmNIN1a, GmNIN2a and GmNIN2b play functionally redundant yet complicated roles for soybean nodulation. GmNIN1b, although is expressed at comparable level with other homologs, plays a minor role in root nodule symbiosis. Our work provides insight into the understanding of asymmetrically redundant function of GmNIN genes in soybean.",

    "abstract": "The apical domain of epithelial cells can acquire a diverse array of morphologies and functions, which is critical for the function of epithelial tissues. The Crumbs proteins are evolutionary conserved transmembrane proteins with essential roles in promoting apical domain formation in epithelial cells. The short intracellular tail of Crumbs proteins interacts with a variety of proteins, including the scaffolding protein Pals1 (protein associated with LIN7, Stardust in Drosophila). Pals1 in turn binds to a second scaffolding protein termed PATJ (Pals1-associated tight junction protein), to form the core Crumbs/Pals1/PATJ Crumbs complex. While essential roles in epithelial organization have been shown for Crumbs proteins in Drosophila and mammalian systems, the three Caenorhabditis elegans crumbs genes are dispensable for epithelial polarization and animal development. Moreover, the presence and functioning of orthologs of Pals1 and PATJ has not been investigated. Here, we identify MAGU-2 and MPZ-1 as the C. elegans orthologs of Pals1 and PATJ, respectively. We show that MAGU-2 interacts with all three Crumbs proteins as well as MPZ-1, and localizes to the apical membrane domain in a Crumbs-dependent fashion. Similar to crumbs mutants, a magu-2 null mutant shows no developmental or epithelial polarity defects. Finally, we show that overexpression of the Crumbs proteins EAT-20 or CRB-3 in the C. elegans intestine can lead to apical membrane expansion. Our results shed light into the composition of the C. elegans Crumbs complex and indicate that the role of Crumbs proteins in promoting apical domain formation is conserved.",

    "abstract": "Histone proteolysis is a poorly understood phenomenon in which the N-terminal tails of histones are irreversibly cleaved by intracellular proteases. During development, histone post-translational modifications are known to orchestrate gene expression patterns that ultimately drive cell fate decisions. Therefore, deciphering the mechanisms of histone proteolysis is necessary to enhance the understanding of cellular differentiation. Here we show that H2A is cleaved by the lysosomal protease Cathepsin L during ESCs differentiation. Using quantitative mass spectrometry (MS), we identified L23 to be the primary cleavage site that gives rise to the clipped form of H2A (cH2A), which reaches a maximum level of ~1% of total H2A after four days of differentiation. Using ChIP-seq, we found that preventing proteolysis leads to an increase in acetylated H2A at promoter regions in differentiated ES cells. We also identified novel readers of different acetylated forms of H2A in pluripotent ES cells, such as members of the PBAF remodeling complex. Finally, we showed that H2A proteolysis abolishes this recognition. Altogether, our data suggests that proteolysis serves as an efficient mechanism to silence pluripotency genes and destabilize the nucleosome core particle.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance of Gram-negative bacteria is largely attributed to the low permeability of their outer membrane (OM). Recently, we disclosed the eNTRy rules, a key lesson of which is that the introduction of a primary amine enhances OM permeation in certain contexts. To understand the molecular basis for this finding, we perform an extensive set of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations comparing the permeation of aminated and amine-free antibiotic derivatives through the most abundant OM porin of E. coli, OmpF. To improve sampling of conformationally flexible drugs in MD simulations, we developed a novel, Monte Carlo and graph theory based algorithm to probe more efficiently the rotational and translational degrees of freedom visited during the permeation of the antibiotic molecule through OmpF. The resulting pathways were then used for free-energy calculations, revealing a lower barrier against the permeation of the aminated compound, substantiating its greater OM permeability. Further analysis revealed that the amine facilitates permeation by enabling the antibiotic to align its dipole to the luminal electric field of the porin and while forming favorable electrostatic interactions with specific, highly-conserved charged residues. The importance of these interactions in permeation was further validated with experimental mutagenesis and whole cell accumulation assays. Overall, this study provides insights on the importance of the primary amine for antibiotic permeation into Gram-negative pathogens that could help the design of future antibiotics. We also offer a new computational approach for calculating free-energy of processes where relevant molecular conformations cannot be efficiently captured.",

Here we demonstrate that the interaction of the Thioflavin T dye with -synuclein from MSA and Parkinsons disease patients can be modulated by the type of salt, pH, and ionic strength used to generate strain-specific reaction buffers. Employing this novel approach, we have generated a streamlined Real-Time Quaking-induced Conversion assay capable of categorizing MSA brains according to their -synuclein seeding behavior, and to unravel a previously unrecognized heterogeneity in seeding activity between different brain regions of a given individual that goes beyond immunohistochemical observations and provide a framework for future molecular subtyping of MSA.",

    "abstract": "More than 2 million SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been generated and shared since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and constitute a vital information source that informs outbreak control, disease surveillance, and public health policy. The Pango dynamic nomenclature is a popular system for classifying and naming genetically-distinct lineages of SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, and is based on the analysis of complete or near-complete virus genomes. However, for several reasons, nucleotide sequences may be generated that cover only the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2. It is therefore important to understand how much information about Pango lineage status is contained in spike-only nucleotide sequences. Here we explore how Pango lineages might be reliably designated and assigned to spike-only nucleotide sequences. We survey the genetic diversity of such sequences, and investigate the information they contain about Pango lineage status. Although many lineages, including the main variants of concern, can be identified clearly using spike-only sequences, some spike-only sequences are shared among tens or hundreds of Pango lineages. To facilitate the classification of SARS-CoV-2 lineages using subgenomic sequences we introduce the notion of designating such sequences to a \"lineage set\", which represents the range of Pango lineages that are consistent with the observed mutations in a given spike sequence. These data provide a foundation for the development of software tools that can assign newly-generated spike nucleotide sequences to Pango lineage sets.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid protein aggregates are not only associated with neurodegenerative diseases and may also occur as unwanted by-products in protein-based therapeutics. Surfactants are often employed to stabilize protein formulations and reduce the risk of aggregation. However, surfactants alter protein-protein interactions and may thus modulate the physicochemical characteristics of any aggregates formed. Human insulin aggregation was induced at low pH in the presence of varying concentrations of the surfactant polysorbate 80. Various spectroscopic and imaging methods were used to study the aggregation kinetics, as well as structure and morphology of the formed aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the initial interaction between the surfactant and insulin. Addition of polysorbate 80 slowed down, but did not prevent, aggregation of insulin. Amyloid spherulites formed under all conditions, with a higher content of intermolecular beta-sheets in the presence of the surfactant above its critical micelle concentration. In addition, a denser packing was observed, leading to a more stable aggregate. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested a tendency for insulin to form dimers in the presence of the surfactant, indicating a change in protein-protein interactions. It is thus shown that surfactants not only alter aggregation kinetics, but also affect physicochemical properties of any aggregates formed.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveGATA6 is a master regulator of pancreatic differentiation and a key regulator of the classical phenotype in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Low GATA6 expression is associated with poor patient outcome. GATA4 is the second most expressed GATA factor in the pancreas. The aim was to assess whether, and how, GATA4 contributes to PDAC phenotype and to analyze the association of expression with clinical outcome.\n\nDesignWe analyzed PDAC transcriptomic data, stratifying cases according to GATA4 and GATA6 expression, and identified differentially expressed genes and pathways. A multicenter TMA study to assess GATA4 and GATA6 expression in PDAC samples (n=745) from patients undergoing tumour resection was performed using immunohistochemistry with antibodies of validated specificity. GATA4 and GATA6 levels were dichotomized into high/low categorical variables; association with outcome was assessed using univariable and multivariable Cox regression models.\n\nResultsSubtype classification using transcriptomic data revealed that GATA4 mRNA is enriched in classical, compared to basal-like tumours. We classified samples in 4 groups as high/low for GATA4 and GATA6. Reduced expression of GATA4 did not have a major transcriptional impact. However, concomitant low expression of GATA4 enhanced the transcriptomic effects of GATA6 low expression. Reduced expression of both proteins in tumours was associated with the worst patient survival. GATA4 and GATA6 expression significantly decreased in metastases and negatively correlated with basal markers.\n\nConclusionsOur analyses uncover a cooperative interaction between GATA4 and GATA6 to maintain the classical PDAC phenotype and provide compelling clinical rationale for assessing their expression as biomarkers of poor prognosis.\n\nSUMMARY BOXO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this subject?C_ST_ABS- Patients with classical-type PDAC have a better outcome\n- Retrospective analyses suggest that classical-type PDAC is more sensitive to 5-FU-based chemotherapy\n- GATA6 is a surrogate biomarker of classical tumours and its expression is associated with better survival\n- GATA4 and GATA6 have overlapping and unique functions during pancreatic and gastrointestinal development\n\n\nWhat are the new findings?- Tumours displaying only low GATA4 expression have a transcriptomic profile similar to those with preserved expression of both transcription factors\n- Combined low expression of GATA4 and GATA6 has the highest transcriptomic impact\n- In a large multicenter tissue microarray study, patients with tumours showing low expression of both GATA4 and GATA6 have the worst overall survival\n- Low expression of GATA4 and GATA6 is an independent predictor of survival in patients with resectable PDAC\n- GATA4 levels are down-regulated in liver metastases and are negatively correlated with basal markers such as KRT5/6, KRT14, and TP63\n\n\nHow might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?- The combined assessment of GATA4 and GATA6 expression may improve prognostic stratification of patients with PDAC\n- Prospective studies should confirm whether GATA4 and GATA6 expression is also predictive of response to chemotherapy in PDAC patients",

Though the apoptosis of keratinocytes is a feature of OLP, not much is known about the clearance of cell debris (efferocytosis) resulting from apoptosis. We postulate that there is a defective or delayed efferocytosis in OLP, which may have a role in modulating the immune response in OLP.\n\nMethodsPublished mRNA expression of tissue of 14 patients with OLP and 14 cases of normal tissues were subjected to differential analysis (DE) and a list of DE genes identified. From this list, the genes that involved in efferocytosis were collated, compared and their interactions are typed.\n\nResultIn all, two studies fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. On combining the data, 1486 genes were significantly different between OLP and normal tissues. 28 of these 1486 genes are were associated with efferocytosis of which the suppression of LRP1, LDLR, ANAX2, C2, PBX1, PDCD4, S1PR5, CX3CL1, STAT6 and Wnt3A is indicative of defective or delayed efferocytosis in OLP. The role of pathways and associations were analyzed and is presented here.\n\nDiscussion and ConclusionThe study revealed that certain key genes mRNAs that are associated with efferocytosis are altered in OLP. They could delay or lead to defective efferocytosis. Studying such genes in detail could provide deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and the discovery of therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "C4 photosynthesis is thought to have evolved via intermediate stages, with changes towards the C4 phenotype gradually enhancing photosynthetic performance. This hypothesis is widely supported by modelling studies, but experimental tests are missing. Mixing of C4 components to generate artificial intermediates can be achieved via crossing, and the grass Alloteropsis semialata represents an outstanding system since it includes C4 and non-C4 populations. Here, we analyse F1 hybrids between C3 and C4, and C3+C4 and C4 genotypes to determine whether the acquisition of C4 characteristics increases photosynthetic performance. The hybrids have leaf anatomical characters and C4 gene expression profiles that are largely intermediate between those of their parents. Carbon isotope ratios are similarly intermediate, which suggests that a partial C4 cycle coexists with C3 carbon fixation in the hybrids. This partial C4 phenotype is associated with C4-like photosynthetic efficiency in C3+C4 x C4, but not in C3 x C4 hybrids, which are overall less efficient than both parents. Our results support the hypothesis that the photosynthetic gains from the upregulation of C4 characteristics depend on coordinated changes in anatomy and biochemistry. The order of acquisition of C4 components is thus constrained, with C3+C4 species providing an essential step for C4 evolution.",

    "abstract": "Presbyosmia, or aging related olfactory loss, occurs in a majority of humans over age 65 years, yet remains poorly understood, with no specific treatment options. The olfactory epithelium (OE) in the nasal fossa is the peripheral organ for olfaction, and is subject to acquired damage, suggesting a likely site of pathology in aging. OE basal stem cells reconstitute the neuroepithelium in response to cell loss under normal conditions. In aged OE, patches of respiratory-like metaplasia have been observed histologically, consistent with a failure in normal neuroepithelial homeostasis or repair. Accordingly, we have focused on identifying cellular and molecular changes in presbyosmic OE. Combining psychophysical testing with olfactory mucosa biopsy analysis, single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and human olfactory culture studies, we identified evidence for inflammation-associated changes in the OE stem cells of presbyosmic patients. The presbyosmic basal stem cells exhibited increased expression of genes involved in response to cytokines or stress, or the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. To facilitate further study of human OE stem cells, we developed an adult human basal cell culture model. Characterization of cultures using scRNA-seq confirmed maintenance of a reserve stem cell-like phenotype, and brief cytokine exposure in basal cell cultures resulted in increased expression of TP63, a transcription factor acting to prevent OE stem cell differentiation. Our data are consistent with a process by which aging-related inflammatory changes in OE stem cells may contribute to presbyosmia, via the disruption of normal epithelial homeostasis, suggesting that OE stem cells may represent a rational therapeutic target for restoration of olfaction.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySingle cell profiling suggests that inflammatory-associated olfactory epithelial stem cell dysfunction is associated with presbyosmia in humans.",

    "abstract": "The vasculature is a key component of adult brain neural stem cell (NSC) niches. In the adult mammalian hippocampus, NSCs reside in close contact with a dense capillary network. How this niche is maintained is unclear. We recently found that adult hippocampal NSCs express vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a soluble factor with chemoattractive properties for vascular endothelia. Here, we show that NSC-specific VEGF loss led to dissociation of NSCs from local vasculature but surprisingly found no changes in vascular density. Instead, we found that NSC-derived VEGF supports the motility of NSCs themselves via a cell internal signaling loop. We further found that this internal autocrine loop also independently maintained NSC quiescence cell autonomously. Combined, our findings suggest that NSCs maintain their populations via 2 mechanisms that are dependent on cell internal VEGF signaling: self-stimulated motility towards vasculature and cell autonomous maintenance of quiescence programs.",

    "abstract": "Although conventional averaging across predefined frequency bands reduces the complexity of EEG functional connectivity (FC), it obscures the identification of resting-state brain networks (RSN) and impedes accurate estimation of FC reliability. Extending prior work, we combined scalp current source density (CSD; spherical spline surface Laplacian) and spectral-spatial PCA to identify FC components. Phase-based FC was estimated via debiased weighted phase-locking index from CSD-transformed resting EEGs (71 sensors, 8 min, eyes open/closed, 35 healthy adults, 1-week retest). Spectral PCA extracted 6 robust alpha and theta factors (86.6% variance). Subsequent spatial PCA for each spectral factor revealed seven robust regionally-focused (posterior, central, frontal) and long-range (posterior-anterior) alpha components (peaks at 8, 10 and 13 Hz) and a midfrontal theta (6 Hz) component, accounting for 37.0% of FC variance. These spatial FC components were consistent with well-known networks (e.g., default mode, visual, sensorimotor), and four were sensitive to eyes open/closed conditions. Most FC components had good-to-excellent internal consistency (odd/even epochs, eyes open/closed) and test-retest reliability (ICCs [&ge;] .8). Moreover, the FC component structure was generally present in subsamples (session x odd/even epoch, or smaller subgroups [n = 7-10]), as indicated by similarity of factor loadings across PCA solutions. Apart from systematically reducing FC dimensionality, our approach avoids arbitrary thresholds and allows quantification of meaningful and reliable network components that may prove to be of high relevance for basic and clinical research applications.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe use of wearable sensor devices on daily basis to track real-time movements during wake and sleep has provided opportunities for automatic sleep quantification using such data. Existing algorithms for classifying sleep stages often require large training data and multiple input signals including heart rate and respiratory data. We aimed to examine the capability of classifying sleep stages using sensible features directly from accelerometers only with the aid of advanced recurrent neural networks.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe analyzed a publicly available dataset with accelerometry data in 5s epoch length and polysomnography assessments. We developed long short-term memory (LSTM) models that take the 3-axis accelerations, angles, and temperatures from concurrent and historic observation windows to predict wake, REM and non-REM sleep. Leave-one-subject-out experiments were conducted to compare and evaluate the model performance with conventional nonsequential machine learning models using metrics such as multiclass training and testing accuracy, weighted precision, F1 score and area-under-the-curve (AUC).\n\nResultsOur sequential analysis framework outperforms traditional non-sequential models in all aspects of model evaluation metrics. We achieved an average of 65% and a maximum of 81% validation accuracy for classifying three sleep labels even with a relatively small training sample of clinical visitors. The presence of two additional derived variables, local variability and range, have shown to strongly improve the model performance.\n\nDiscussionResults indicate that it is crucial to account for deep temporal dependency and assess local variability of the features. The post-hoc analysis of individual model performances on subjects demographic characteristics also suggest the need of including pathological samples in the training data in order to develop robust machine learning models that are capable of capturing normal and anomaly sleep patterns in the population.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundQuantitative EEG (qEEG) can capture changes in brain activity that follow a stroke. Accordingly, EEG metrics could be used to monitor patients state and recovery. Although qEEG metrics traditionally focus on oscillatory activity, recent findings highlight the importance of aperiodic (power-law) structure in characterizing pathological brain states.\n\nObjectiveTo assess neurophysiological impairment and recovery from mono-hemispheric stroke by means of the Spectral Exponent (SE), a metric that reflects EEG slowing and quantifies the power-law decay of the EEG Power Spectral Density (PSD). To relate neurophysiological recovery with patients functional outcome.\n\nMethodsEighteen patients (n=18) with Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) ischaemic stroke were retrospectively enrolled for this study. Patients underwent EEG recording in the sub-acute phase (T0) and after 2 months of physical rehabilitation (T1). Sixteen healthy controls (HC; n=16) matched by age and sex were enrolled as a normative group. SE values and narrow-band PSD were estimated for each recording. We compared SE and band-power between patients and HC, and between the affected (AH) and unaffected hemisphere (UH) at T0 and T1 in patients.\n\nResultsAt T0, stroke patients showed significantly more negative SE values than HC (p=0.003), reflecting broad-band EEG slowing. Moreover, SE over the AH was consistently more negative compared to the UH and showed a renormalization at T1 in our patient sample. This SE renormalization significantly correlated with NIHSS improvement (R= 0.63, p=0.005).\n\nConclusionsSE is a reliable readout of the electric changes occurring in the brain after an ischaemic cortical lesion. Moreover, SE holds the promise to be a robust method to assess stroke impairment as well as to monitor and predict functional outcome.",

The damaged sites can be visualized as \"gaps\" in phalloidin staining of F-actin, and the enrichment of monomeric actin at these sites, along with an actin nucleator and crosslinker, suggests that localized remodeling occurs to repair the broken filaments. Herein we show that gaps in mouse auditory hair cells are largely repaired within one week of traumatic noise exposure through the incorporation of newly synthesized actin. Additionally, we report that XIRP2 is required for the repair process and facilitates the enrichment of monomeric{gamma} -actin at gaps through its LIM domain-containing C-terminus. Our study describes a novel process by which hair cells can recover from sub-lethal hair bundle damage and which may contribute to recovery from temporary hearing threshold shifts and the prevention of age-related hearing loss.",

    "abstract": "Colistin has emerged as an important last line of defence for the treatment of infections caused by antibiotic resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Here we investigate the responses of {approx}1,000 populations of an MDR strain of P. aeruginosa to a high dose of colistin. Colistin exposure resulted in rapid cell death, but a sub-set of populations eventually recovered due to the outgrowth of heteroresistant cells. Genome sequencing revealed that heteroresistance was primarily driven by mutations in the PmrAB two-component system that occurred at a rate ({approx}2x10-5 per cell division) that was 103-104 fold higher than typical resistance mutation rates. Crucially, this elevated mutation rate was only found in pmrB, demonstrating that hypermutability is localized to this gene. PmrAB provides resistance to antimicrobial peptides that are involved in host immunity, suggesting that this pathogen may have evolved a high mutation rate as an adaption to generate mutants that are resistant to host antimicrobial peptides that are secreted during infection. Interestingly, we found no mutations in 1/3 of populations that recovered from colistin treatment, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity and/or persister cells contribute to the ability of Pseudomonas to adapt to colistin.",

These multiple RNA Packaging Signals (PSs) form stem-loops presenting in each loop a core protein recognition motif, -RGAG-. Small, drug-like molecules binding these motifs were identified by screening an immobilized library with a fluorescently-labelled RNA oligonucleotide encompassing the most conserved of these sites. This identified 66 \"hits\", with affinities ranging from low nanomolar to high micromolar in SPR assays. High affinity ligand binding is dependent on the presence of the -RGAG-motif, which also appears to be the common element in cross-binding to other PS sites. Some of these compounds are potent inhibitors of in vitro core protein assembly around the HBV pre-genome. Mathematical modelling confirms the potential of these novel anti-viral drug targets for disrupting replication of this major human pathogen. Preliminary structure-activity relationships of the highest affinity compound reveal critical functional groups for PS-binding.

    "abstract": "In spite of the successful development of effective countermeasures against Covid-19, variants have and will continue to emerge that could compromise the efficacy of currently approved neutralizing antibodies and vaccines. Consequently, novel and more efficacious agents are urgently needed. We have developed a bispecific antibody, 2022, consisting of two antibodies, 2F8 and VHH18. 2F8 was isolated from our proprietary fully synthetic human IDEAL (Intelligently Designed and Engineered Antibody Library)-VH/VL library and VHH18 is a single domain antibody isolated from IDEAL-nanobody library. 2022 was constructed by attaching VHH18 to the C-terminal of Fc of 2F8. 2022 binds two non-overlapping epitopes simultaneously on the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and blocks the binding of RBD to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 2022 potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and all of the variants tested in both pseudovirus and live virus assays, including variants carrying mutations known to resist neutralizing antibodies approved under EUA and that reduce the protection efficiency of current effective vaccines. The half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2022 is 270 pM, 30 pM, 20 pM, and 1 pM, for wild-type, alpha, beta, and delta pseudovirus, respectively. In the live virus assay, 2022 has an IC50 of 26.4 pM, 13.3 pM, and 88.6 pM, for wild-type, beta, and delta live virus, respectively. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2, 2022 showed strong prophylactic and therapeutic effects. A single administration of 2022 intranasal (i.n.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) 24 hours before virus challenge completely protected all mice from bodyweight loss, as compared with up to 20% loss of bodyweight in placebo treated mice. In addition, the lung viral titers were undetectable (FRNT assay) in all mice treated with 2022 either prophylactically or therapeutically, as compared with around 1x105 pfu/g lung tissue in placebo treated mice. In summary, bispecific antibody 2022 showed potent binding and neutralizing activity across a variety of SARS-CoV-2 variants and could be an attractive weapon to combat the ongoing waves of the COVID-19 pandemic propagated mainly by variants, especially, the much more contagious delta variant.",

    "abstract": "Increased proliferation and survival of resident cells in small pulmonary arteries (PA) are important drivers of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) is a negative regulator of mTOR complex 1 and cell growth. Here we show that TSC2 is deficient in small remodeled PA/PA vascular smooth muscle cells (PAVSMC) from human PAH and experimental PH lungs. TSC2 deficiency was reproduced in vitro by maintaining PAVSMC on pathologically stiff substrates and was required for stiffness-induced proliferation, accumulation of transcriptional co-activators YAP/TAZ and up-regulation of mTOR. Depletion of TSC2 reproduced PH features in vitro in human PAVSMC and in vivo in SM22-Tsc2+/- mice. TSC2 loss in PAVSMC was supported by YAP and led to the up-regulation of YAP/TAZ and mTOR via modulating the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition. ECM, produced by TSC2-deficient PAVSMC, promoted growth of non-diseased PA adventitial fibroblasts and PAVSMC, which, in turn, was prevented by 5{beta}1 integrin receptor antagonist ATN161. In vitro, molecular and pharmacological (SRT2104) restoration of TSC2 down-regulated YAP/TAZ, mTOR, and ECM production, inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in human PAH PAVSMC. In vivo, orally administrated SRT2104 restored TSC2, resolved pulmonary vascular remodeling, PH, and improved right heart in two rodent models of PH. Thus, PAVSMC TSC2 is a critical integrator of ECM composition and stiffness with pro-proliferative signaling and PH, and the restoration of functional TSC2 could be an attractive therapeutic option to treat PH.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryTSC2 acts as mechanosensor and mechanotransducer, integrating ECM composition and stiffness with pro-proliferative signaling in pulmonary vasculature; its deficiency in PA vascular smooth muscle cells results in ECM remodeling, hyper-proliferation and pulmonary hypertension, which could be reversed by pharmacological restoration of functional TSC2.",

    "abstract": "Myosin Va (myoVa) motors transport membrane-bound cargo through three-dimensional, intracellular actin filament networks. We developed a coarse-grained, in silico model to predict how actin filament density (3-800 filaments) within a randomly oriented actin network affects fluid-like liposome (350nm vs. 1,750nm) transport by myoVa motors. 5,000 simulated liposomes transported within each network adopted one of three states: transport, tug of war, or diffusion. Diffusion due to liposome detachment from actin rarely occurred given at least 10 motors on the liposome surface. However, with increased actin density, liposomes transitioned from primarily directed transport on single actin filaments to an apparent random walk, resulting from a mixture of transport and tug of wars as the probability of encountering additional actin filaments increased. This phase transition arises from a percolation phase transition at a critical number of accessible actin filaments, Nc. Nc, is a geometric property of the actin network that depends only on the position and polarity of the actin filaments and the liposome diameter, as evidenced by a five-fold increase in liposome diameter resulting in a five-fold decrease in Nc. Thus, in cells, actin network density and cargo size may be regulated to match cargo delivery to the cells physiological demands.",

    "abstract": "Tilapia tilapinevirus (also known as tilapia lake virus, TiLV) is an important virus responsible for die-off of farmed tilapia globally. Detection and quantification of the virus from environmental DNA/RNA (eDNA/eRNA) using pond water represents a potential, noninvasive routine approach for pathogen monitoring and early disease forecasting in aquaculture systems. Here, we report a simple iron flocculation method for viral concentration from water combined with a newly developed hydrolysis probe quantitative RT-qPCR method for detection and quantification of TiLV. The RT-qPCR method targeting a conserved region of TiLV genome segment 9 has a detection limit of 10 viral copies per {micro}L of template. The method had a 100% analytical specificity and sensitivity for TiLV. The optimized iron flocculation method was able to recover 16.11 {+/-} 3.3% of virus from water samples spiked with viral cultures. During disease outbreak cases from an open-caged system and a closed hatchery system, both tilapia and water samples were collected for detection and quantification of TiLV. The results revealed that TiLV was detected from both clinically sick fish and asymptomatic fish. Most importantly, the virus was successfully detected from water samples collected from different locations in the affected farms e.g. river water samples from affected cages (8.50 x 102 to 2.79 x 104 copies/L) and fish-rearing water samples, sewage, and reservoir (4.29 x 102 to 3.53 x 103 copies/L) from affected and unaffected ponds of the hatchery. In summary, this study suggests that the eRNA detection system using iron flocculation coupled with probe based-RT-qPCR is feasible for concentration and quantification of TiLV from water. This approach might be useful for noninvasive monitoring of TiLV in tilapia aquaculture systems and facilitating appropriate decisions on biosecurity interventions needed.",

We describe here that oxidative stress causes Sty1 kinase-dependent Cdc42 inactivation at cell poles. Both the amount of active Cdc42 at poles and cell length inversely correlate with Sty1 activity, explaining the elongated morphology of{Delta} sty1 cells. We have created stress-blinded cell poles by either eliminating two Cdc42 GAPs or through the constitutive tethering of a GEF to the cell tips, and biochemically demonstrate that Rga3 is a direct substrate of Sty1. We propose that stress-activated Sty1 promotes GTP hydrolysis and prevents GEF activity at the cell tips, thus leading to the inhibition of Cdc42 and polarized growth cessation.",

Whether lung injury can induce alveolar epithelial polyploidy is not known. We show that bleomycin injury induces AT2 cell hypertrophy and polyploidy. AT2 polyploidization is also seen in short term ex vivo cultures, where AT2-to-AT1 trans-differentiation is associated with substantial binucleation due to failed cytokinesis. Both hypertrophic and polyploid features of AT2 cells can be attenuated by inhibiting the integrated stress response (ISR) using the small molecule ISRIB. These data suggest that AT2 hypertrophic growth and polyploidization may be a feature of alveolar epithelial injury. As AT2 cells serve as facultative progenitors for the distal lung epithelium, a propensity for injury-induced binucleation has implications for AT2 self-renewal and regenerative potential upon reinjury, which may benefit from targeting the ISR.",

The first H01 is that canopy position will not influence leaf respiration. The associated alternative hypothesis (HA) is that the upper canopy leaves which are more directly coupled to the atmosphere will experience more challenging environmental conditions and thus have higher respiration rates to facilitate metabolic function. The second H02 is that tree size will not influence leaf respiration. The associated HA is that saplings (stems that are 5-10 cm DBH (diameter at breast height)) will have higher respiration rates than trees (stems [&ge;] 10 cm DBH) since saplings represent the transition from seedlings growing in the more favorable aerodynamic boundary layer, to trees which are fully coupled to the atmosphere but of sufficient size to persist. Respiration did not change with canopy position, however respiration at 25{degrees}C was 42% higher in saplings compared to trees (3.43 {+/-} 0.19 vs. 2.41 {+/-} 0.14 mol m-2 s-1). Furthermore, there were significant differences in the temperature response of respiration, and seedlings reached their maximum respiration rates at 59{degrees}C, more than two degrees higher than trees. Our results demonstrate that the respiratory characteristics of white spruce saplings at treeline are extreme, imposing a significant carbon cost that may contribute to their lack of perseverance beyond treeline. In the absence of thermal acclimation, the rate of leaf respiration could increase by 57% by the end of the century, posing further challenges to the ecology of this massive ecotone.\n\nThis paper is dedicated to the memory of James N.

I will always be grateful for the time he spent helping me, the depth of education he gave me, and his steady mentoring as part of my thesis committee. His devotion to science and push for deeper knowledge of plant respiration set an example for all of us, particularly those who were lucky enough to study with him.

    "abstract": "Fish erythrocytes remain nucleated for their life-span, unlike mammalian erythrocytes which undergo enucleation. Asides transportation of oxygen, fish erythrocytes are capable of several immune defence processes. Nucleated fish erythrocytes represent prime candidates for carrying out ETotic responses. ETosis is an evolutionary conserved innate immune defence process found in both vertebrates and invertebrates, which involves the extrusion of DNA studded with antimicrobial proteins into the extracellular space serving to trap and kill microorganisms. In this report, we demonstrate that fish erythrocytes isolated from Danio rerio (zebrafish) produce ETotic-like responses when exposed to chemical and physiological stimuli. Furthermore, we found Salmo salar (Atlantic salmon) erythrocytes produce similar ETotic responses. We have termed these ET-like formations Fish Erythrocyte Extracellular Traps (FEETs). Interestingly, we discovered that mammalian inducers of NETosis, such as the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and the calcium ionophore ionomycin, induced FEETs. Moreover, we found that FEETs are dependent upon activation of PKC and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Thus, this brief report represents the first demonstration that fish erythrocytes can exhibit ETotic-like responses, unveiling a previously unknown function of nucleated erythrocytes, which sheds new light on the innate immune arsenal of erythrocytes.",

    "abstract": "Given most tissues are consist of abundant and diverse sub cell-types, an important yet unaddressed problem in bulk RNA-seq analysis is to identify at which sub cell-type(s) the differential expression occur. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies can answer the question, but they are often labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive. Here, we present LRcell, a computational method aiming to identify specific sub-cell type(s) that drives the changes observed in a bulk RNA-seq experiment. In addition, LRcell provides pre-embedded marker genes computed from putative single-cell RNA-seq experiments as options to execute the analyses. Using three different real datasets, we show that LRcell successfully identifies known cell types involved in psychiatric disorders and LRcell is more sensitive than even the leading deconvolution methods.",

    "abstract": "The antibiotic linezolid, the first clinically approved member of the oxazolidinone class, inhibits translation of bacterial ribosomes by binding to the peptidyl transferase center. Recent work has demonstrated that linezolid does not inhibit peptide bond formation at all sequences but rather acts in a context-specific manner, namely when alanine occupies the penultimate position of the nascent chain. In this study, we determined that the second-generation oxazolidinone radezolid also induces stalling with alanine at the penultimate position. However, the molecular basis for context-specificity of these inhibitors has not been elucidated. In this study, we determined high-resolution cryo-EM structures of both linezolid and radezolid-stalled ribosome complexes. These structures reveal that the alanine side chain fits within a small hydrophobic crevice created by oxazolidinone, resulting in improved ribosome binding. Modification of the ribosome by the antibiotic resistance enzyme Cfr disrupts stalling by forcing the antibiotic to adopt a conformation that narrows the hydrophobic alanine pocket. Together, the structural and biochemical findings presented in this work provide molecular understanding of context-specific inhibition of translation by clinically important oxazolidinone antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Microscale mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and dynamic cell-ECM interactions play an important role in physiological processes and disease. However, it remains a challenge for current mechanical characterization methods to combine quantitative 3D imaging of ECM mechanics with cellular-scale resolution and dynamic monitoring of cell-mediated changes to pericellular viscoelasticity. Here, we present light-sheet photonic force optical coherence elastography (LS-pfOCE) to address these challenges by leveraging a light-sheet for parallelized, non-invasive, and localized mechanical loading. We demonstrate the capabilities of LS-pfOCE by imaging the micromechanical heterogeneity of fibrous 3D collagen matrices and perform a live-cell study to image micromechanical heterogeneity induced by NIH-3T3 cells seeded in 3D fibrin constructs. We also show that LS-pfOCE is able to quantify temporal variations in pericellular viscoelasticity in response to altered cellular activity. By providing access to the spatiotemporal variations in the micromechanical properties of 3D complex biopolymer constructs and engineered cellular systems, LS-pfOCE has the potential to drive new discoveries in the rapidly growing field of mechanobiology.",

    "abstract": "Protein unfolding is a dynamic cooperative equilibrium between short lived protein conformations. The Zimm-Bragg theory is an ideal algorithm to handle cooperative processes. Here, we extend the analytical capabilities of the Zimm-Bragg theory in two directions. First, we combine the Zimm-Bragg partition function Z(T) with statistical-mechanical thermodynamics, explaining the thermodynamic system properties enthalpy, entropy and free energy with molecular parameters only. Second, the molecular enthalpy h0 to unfold a single amino acid residue is made temperature-dependent. The addition of a heat capacity term cv allows predicting not only heat denaturation, but also cold denaturation. Moreover, it predicts the heat capacity increase [Formula] in protein unfolding. The theory is successfully applied to differential scanning calorimetry experiments of proteins of different size and structure, that is, gpW62 (62aa), ubiquitin (74aa), lysozyme (129aa), metmyoglobin (153aa) and mAb monoclonal antibody (1290aa). Particular attention was given to the free energy, which can easily be obtained from the heat capacity Cp(T). The DSC experiments reveal a zero free energy for the native protein with an immediate decrease to negative free energies upon cold and heat denaturation. This trapezoidal shape is precisely reproduced by the Zimm-Bragg theory, whereas the so far applied non-cooperative 2-state model predicts a parabolic shape with a positive free energy maximum of the native protein. We demonstrate that the molecular parameters of the Zimm-Bragg theory have a well-defined physical meaning. In addition to predicting protein stability, independent of protein size, they yield estimates of unfolding kinetics and can be connected to molecular dynamics calculations.",

    "abstract": "Purkinje cells (PCs) are spontaneously active neurons of the cerebellar cortex that inhibit glutamatergic projection neurons within the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) that in turn provide the primary cerebellar output. Brief reductions in PC firing rapidly increase DCN neuron firing. However, prolonged reductions in PC inhibition, as seen in some disease states, certain types of transgenic mice, and in acute slices of the cerebellum, do not evoke large sustained increases in DCN firing. Here we test whether there is a mechanism of spike-frequency adaptation in DCN neurons that could account for these properties. We find that prolonged optogenetic suppression of PC synapses in vivo transiently elevates PC firing that strongly adapts within ten seconds. We perform current-clamp recordings at near physiological temperature in acute brain slices to examine how DCN neurons respond to prolonged depolarizations. Adaptation in DCN neurons is exceptionally slow and bidirectional. A depolarizing current step evokes large initial increases in firing that decay to less than 20% of the initial increase within approximately ten seconds. Such slow adaptation could allow DCN neurons to adapt to prolonged changes in PC firing while maintaining their linear firing frequency-current relationship on subsecond time scales.",
