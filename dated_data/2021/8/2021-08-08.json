    "abstract": "BackgroundThe cell adhesion molecule transmembrane and immunoglobulin (Ig) domain containing1 (TMIGD1) is a novel tumor suppressor that plays important roles in regulating cell-cell adhesion, cell proliferation and cell cycle. However, the mechanisms of TMIGD1 signaling are not yet fully elucidated.\n\nResultsTMIGD1 binds to the ERM family proteins moesin and ezrin, and an evolutionarily conserved RRKK motif on the carboxyl terminus of TMIGD1 mediates the interaction of TMIGD1 with the N-terminal ERM domains of moesin and ezrin. TMIGD1 governs the apical localization of moesin and ezrin, as the loss of TMIGD1 in mice altered apical localization of moesin and ezrin in epithelial cells. In cell culture, TMIGD1 inhibited moesin-induced filopodia-like protrusions and cell migration. More importantly, TMIGD1 stimulated the Lysine (K40) acetylation of -tubulin and promoted mitotic spindle organization and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of moesin impaired the TMIGD1-mediated acetylation of -tubulin and filamentous (F)-actin organization.\n\nConclusionsTMIGD1 binds to moesin and ezrin, and regulates their cellular localization. Moesin plays critical roles in TMIGD1-dependent acetylation of -tubulin, mitotic spindle organization and cell migration. Our findings offer a molecular framework for understanding the complex functional interplay between TMIGD1 and the ERM family proteins in the regulation of cell adhesion and mitotic spindle assembly, and have wide-ranging implications in physiological and pathological processes such as cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "Insulin secretion in the pancreatic beta cell is rate-limited by glucokinase (GCK), the glucose sensor that catalyzes the first step of glucose metabolism. GCK consists of two lobes connected by a flexible hinge that allows the kinase to exhibit a spectrum of conformations ranging from the active, closed form to several inactive, less-compact forms. Activating GCK mutations can cause hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia in infants. A similar phenotype exhibited by tankyrase (TNKS)-deficient mice prompted us to investigate whether TNKS might modulate the glucose-sensing function of GCK. We found that TNKS colocalizes and directly interacts with GCK. Their interaction is mediated by two ankyrin-repeat clusters (ARC-2 and -5) in TNKS and a tankyrase-binding motif (TBM, aa 63-68) in the GCK hinge. This interaction is conformation sensitive, human GCK variants that cause hyperglycemia (V62M) or hypoglycemia (S64Y) enhance or diminish the interaction respectively, even though they have no impact on TNKS interaction in the context of a GCK peptide (V62M) or a peptide library (S64Y). Moreover, the TNKS-GCK interaction is inhibited by high glucose concentrations, which are known to stabilize GCK in the active (closed, glucose-avid) conformation. Conversely, glucose phosphorylation by GCK in vitro is inhibited by TNKS. To study this in vitro inhibitory effect in the MIN6 beta cells, we showed that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is suppressed upon stabilization of the TNKS protein and is conversely enhanced upon TNKS knockdown. Based on these findings as well as by contrasting with hexokinase-2, we propose that TNKS is a physiological GCK inhibitor in pancreatic beta cells that acts by trapping the kinase in the open (inactive) conformation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms driving phenotypic variation in traits facing intensified selection from climate change is a crucial step in developing effective conservation and restoration initiatives. This is particularly true for reef-building corals, which are among the most vulnerable to climate change and are in dramatic decline globally. At the Rowley Shoals in Western Australia, the prominent reef flat becomes exposed on low tide and the stagnant water in the shallow atoll lagoons heats up, creating a natural laboratory for characterising the mechanisms that control phenotypic responses to different environments. We combined whole genome re-sequencing, common garden heat stress experiments, transcriptome-wide gene expression analyses, and symbiont metabarcoding to explore the mechanisms that facilitate survival in contrasting habitat conditions. Our data show that, despite high gene flow between habitats, spatially varying selection drives subtle shifts in allele frequencies at hundreds of loci. These changes were concentrated into several islands of divergence spanning hundreds of SNPs that showed strong linkage disequilibrium and were associated with a coordinated increase in minor allele frequencies in corals taken from the lagoon habitat, where the range of environmental conditions is greatest. Common garden heat stress assays showed individuals from the lagoon exhibited higher bleaching resistance than colonies from the reef slope, and RNAseq identified pronounced physiological differences between the corals from the two habitats, primarily associated with molecular pathways including cell signalling, ion transport and metabolism. Despite the pronounced physioloigical and environmental differences between habitats, metabarcoding of the Symbiodiniaceae ITS2 region revealed all colonies to be associated exclusively with the genus Cladocopium, with no detectable differences between habitats. This study contributes to the growing number of studies documenting the complex mechanisms that facilitate coral survival in extreme environments, and showcases the utility of combining multiple sequencing techniques to unravel complex climate-related traits.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac directed differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells consistently produces a mixed population of cardiomyocytes and non-cardiac cell types even when using very well-characterized protocols. We wondered whether differentiated cell types might result from intrinsic differences in hiPS cells prior to the onset of differentiation. By associating individual differentiated cells that share a common hiPS cell precursor, we were able to test whether expression variability in differentiated cells was pre-determined from the hiPS cell state. Although within a single experiment, differentiated cells that share an hiPS cell progenitor were more transcriptionally similar to each other than to other cells in the differentiated population, when the same hiPS cells were differentiated in parallel, we did not observe high transcriptional similarity across differentiations. Additionally, we found that substantial cell death occurred during differentiation in a manner that suggested that all cells were equally likely to survive or die, suggesting that there was no intrinsic selection bias for cells descended from particular hiPS cell progenitors. These results led us to wonder about how cells grow out spatially during the directed differentiation process. Labeling cells by their expression of a few canonical cell type marker genes, we showed that cells expressing the same marker tended to occur in patches observable by visual inspection, suggesting that cell type determination across multiple cell types, once initiated, is maintained in a cell-autonomous manner for multiple divisions. Altogether, our results show that while there is substantial heterogeneity in the initial hiPS cell population, that heterogeneity is not responsible for heterogeneous outcomes, and that the window during which cell type specification occurs is likely to begin shortly after the seeding of hiPS cells for differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Computational methods and tools are a powerful complementary approach to experimental work for studying regulatory interactions in living cells and systems. We demonstrate the use of formal reasoning methods as applied to the Caenorhabditis elegans germ line, which is an accessible model system for stem cell research. The dynamics of the underlying genetic networks and their potential regulatory interactions are key for understanding mechanisms that control cellular decision-making between stem cells and differentiation. We model the \"stem cell fate\" versus entry into the \"meiotic development\" pathway decision circuit in the young adult germ line based on an extensive study of published experimental data and known/hypothesized genetic interactions. We apply a formal reasoning framework to derive predictive networks for control of differentiation. Using this approach we simultaneously specify many possible scenarios and experiments together with potential genetic interactions, and synthesize genetic networks consistent with all encoded experimental observations. In silico analysis of knock-down and overexpression experiments within our model recapitulate published phenotypes of mutant animals and can be applied to make predictions on cellular decision-making. This work lays a foundation for developing realistic whole tissue models of the C. elegans germ line where each cell in the model will execute a synthesized genetic network.",

    "abstract": "The epiblast of vertebrate embryos is comprised of neural and non-neural ectoderm, with the border territory at their intersection harbouring neural crest and cranial placode progenitors. Here we profile avian epiblast cells as a function of time using single-cell RNA-seq to define transcriptional changes in the emerging  neural plate border. The results reveal gradual establishment of heterogeneous neural plate border signatures, including novel genes that we validate by fluorescent in situ hybridisation. Developmental trajectory analysis shows that segregation of neural plate border lineages only commences at early neurulation, rather than at gastrulation as previously predicted. We find that cells expressing the prospective neural crest marker Pax7 contribute to multiple lineages, and a subset of premigratory neural crest cells shares a transcriptional signature with their border precursors. Together, our results suggest that cells at the neural plate border remain heterogeneous until early neurulation, at which time progenitors become progressively allocated toward defined lineages.",
