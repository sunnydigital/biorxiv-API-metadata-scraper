    "abstract": "Humans are exposed to extreme environmental stressors during spaceflight and return with alterations in brain structure and shifts in intracranial fluids. To date, no studies have evaluated the effects of spaceflight on perivascular spaces (PVSs) within the brain, which are believed to facilitate fluid drainage and brain homeostasis. Here, we examined how the number and morphology of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible PVSs are affected by spaceflight, including prior spaceflight experience. Fifteen astronauts underwent six T1-weighted 3T MRI scans, twice prior to launch and four times following their return to Earth after [~]6-month missions to the International Space Station. White matter MRI-visible PVS number and morphology were calculated using an established automated segmentation algorithm. We found that novice astronauts showed an increase in total PVS volume from pre- to post-flight, whereas experienced crewmembers did not (adjusted for age, sex, and time between landing and first MRI scan). Moreover, experienced astronauts exhibited a significant correlation between more previous flight days and greater PVS median length at baseline, suggesting that experienced astronauts exhibit holdover effects from prior spaceflight(s). There was also a significant positive correlation between pre- to post-flight increases in PVS median length and increases in right lateral ventricular volume. The presence of spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) was not associated with PVS number or morphology. Together, these findings demonstrate that spaceflight is associated with PVS morphological changes, and specifically that spaceflight experience is an important factor in determining PVS characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Retinal degeneration is a leading cause of human blindness due to progressive loss of ciliated photoreceptors cells. While this degradation can be associated with cohesion defects of the microtubule-based connecting cilium (CC) structure, the underlying mechanism is not understood. Here, using expansion microscopy and electron microscopy, we reveal the molecular architecture of the CC and demonstrate that microtubules are linked together by a CC-inner scaffold (CC-IS) containing POC5, CENTRIN and FAM161A. Monitoring CC-IS assembly during photoreceptor development in mouse reveals that it acts as a structural zipper, progressively bridging microtubule doublets and straightening the CC. Consistently, Fam161a mutations lead to a specific CC-IS loss and trigger microtubule doublets spreading, prior to outer segment collapse and photoreceptor degeneration, providing a molecular mechanism for retinitis pigmentosa disease.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe connecting cilium inner scaffold acts as a structural zipper granting photoreceptor integrity.",

    "abstract": "The Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC; consisting of Borealin, Survivin, INCENP and Aurora B kinase) and Shugoshin 1 (Sgo1) are key regulators of chromosome bi-orientation, a process essential for error-free chromosome segregation. Their functions rely on their ability to associate with centromeres. Two histone phosphorylations, histone H3 Thr3 (H3T3ph; directly recognised by Survivin) and histone H2A Thr120 (H2AT120ph; indirectly recognised via Sgo1), together with CPCs intrinsic ability to bind nucleosome, facilitate CPC centromere recruitment. The molecular basis for CPC-Sgo1 binding and how their direct interaction influences CPC centromere localisation and function are lacking. Here, using an integrative structure-function approach, we show that the histone H3-like Sgo1 N-terminal tail interacts with Survivin acting as a hot-spot for CPC-Sgo1 assembly, while downstream Sgo1 residues, mainly with Borealin contributes for high affinity interaction. Disruption of the Sgo1 N-terminal tail-Survivin interaction abolished CPC-Sgo1 assembly in vitro and perturbed centromere localisation and function of CPC. Our findings provide evidence that CPC binding to Sgo1 and histone H3 N-terminal tail are mutually exclusive, suggesting that these interactions will likely take place in a spatially/temporally restricted manner and provide a rationale for the Sgo1-mediated  kinetochore proximal centromere pool of CPC.",

However, what kind of cells provide a native microenvironment for renal progenitor cells has not been clarified. Here, single-cell sequencing of zebrafish kidney revealed that fabp10 was a marker of renal interstitial cells (RICs), and the Tg(fabp10a:GFP) transgenic line can specifically label RICs in zebrafish kidney. The formation of RICs and nephrons are closely accompanied during nephron regeneration. RICs form a network to wrap the renal progenitor cell aggregates. RICs in close contact with cell aggregates express cyclooxygenase 2 and secrete prostaglandin 2 (PGE2). Inhibiting PGE2 production prevented nephrogenesis by reducing the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cell aggregates. PGE2 promoted maturation of the nephron by activating the WNT signaling pathway in progenitor cell aggregates in cooperation with Wnt4a. These findings suggest that RICs provide a necessary microenvironment for rapid nephrogenesis during nephron regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic mechanisms diversify cell fates during development. How cells randomly choose between two or more fates remains poorly understood. In the Drosophila eye, the random mosaic of two R7 photoreceptor subtypes is determined by expression of the transcription factor Spineless (Ss). Here, we investigated how cis-regulatory elements and trans factors regulate nascent transcriptional activity and chromatin compaction at the ss gene locus during R7 development. We find that the ss locus is in a compact state in undifferentiated cells. An early enhancer drives ss transcription in all R7 precursors to open the ss locus. In differentiating cells, transcription ceases and the ss locus stochastically remains open or compacts. In SsON R7s, ss is open and competent for activation by a late enhancer, whereas in SsOFF R7s, ss is compact and repression prevents expression. Our results suggest that a temporally dynamic antagonism, in which transcription drives decompaction and then compaction represses transcription, controls stochastic cell fate specification.",

    "abstract": "The Fram Strait plays a crucial role in regulating the heat and sea-ice dynamics in the Arctic. In response to the ongoing global warming, the marine biota of this Arctic gateway is experiencing significant changes with increasing advection of Atlantic species. The footprint of this \"Atlantification\" has been identified in isolated observations across the plankton community, but a systematic, multi-decadal perspective on how regional climate change facilitates the invasion of Atlantic species and affects the ecology of the resident species is lacking. Here we evaluate a series of 51 depth-resolved plankton profiles collected in the Fram Strait during seven surveys between 1985 and 2015, using planktonic foraminifera as a proxy for changes in both the pelagic community composition and species vertical habitat depth. The time series reveals a progressive shift towards more Atlantic species, occurring independently of changes in local environmental conditions. We conclude that this trend is reflecting higher production of the Atlantic species in the \"source\" region, from where they are advected into the Fram Strait. At the same time, we observe that the ongoing extensive sea-ice export from the Arctic and associated cooling-induced decline in density and habitat shoaling of the subpolar Turborotalita quinqueloba, whereas the resident Neogloboquadrina pachyderma persists. As a result, the planktonic foraminiferal community and vertical structure in the Fram Strait shifts to a new state, driven by both remote forcing of the Atlantic invaders and local climatic changes acting on the resident species. The strong summer export of Arctic sea ice has so far buffered larger plankton transformation. We predict that if the sea-ice export will decrease, the Arctic gateway will experience rapid restructuring of the pelagic community, even in the absence of further warming. Such a large change in the gateway region will likely propagate into the Arctic proper.",

    "abstract": "The decarboxylation of pyruvate is a central reaction in the carbon metabolism of all organisms. Both the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) and the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex catalyze this reaction. Whereas PFOR reduces ferredoxin, the PDH complex utilizes NAD+. Anaerobes rely on PFOR, which was replaced during evolution by the PDH complex found in aerobes. Cyanobacteria possess both. Our data challenge the view that PFOR is exclusively utilized for fermentation. Instead, we show, that the cyanobacterial PFOR is stable in the presence of oxygen in vitro and is required for optimal photomixotrophic growth under aerobic conditions while the PDH complex is inactivated under the same conditions. We found that cells rely on a general shift from utilizing NAD(H)-dependent to ferredoxin-dependent enzymes under these conditions.\n\nThe utilization of ferredoxins instead of NAD(H) saves a greater share of the Gibbs free energy, instead of wasting it as heat. This obviously simultaneously decelerates metabolic reactions as they operate closer to their thermodynamic equilibrium. It is common thought that during evolution, ferredoxins were replaced by NAD(P)H due to their higher stability in an oxidizing atmosphere. However, utilization of NAD(P)H could also have been favored due to a higher competitiveness because of an accelerated metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The historical signal in nucleotide sequences becomes eroded over time by substitutions occurring repeatedly at the same sites. This phenomenon, known as substitution saturation, is recognized as one of the primary obstacles to deep-time phylogenetic inference using genome-scale data sets. We present a new test of substitution saturation and demonstrate its performance in simulated and empirical data. For some of the 36 empirical phylogenomic data sets that we examined, we detect substitution saturation in around 50% of loci. We found that saturation tends to be flagged as problematic in loci with highly discordant phylogenetic signals across sites. Within each data set, the loci with smaller numbers of informative sites are more likely to be flagged as containing problematic levels of saturation. The entropy saturation test proposed here is sensitive to high evolutionary rates relative to the evolutionary timeframe, while also being sensitive to several factors known to mislead phylogenetic inference, including short internal branches relative to external branches, short nucleotide sequences, and tree imbalance. Our study demonstrates that excluding loci with substitution saturation can be an effective means of mitigating the negative impact of multiple substitutions on phylogenetic inferences.",

Although there is good evidence for parent-of-origin effects in honey bees the epigenetic mechanisms that underlie these effects remain a mystery. Small RNA molecules such as miRNAs, piRNAs and siRNAs play important roles in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and in the regulation of gene expression during development. Here we present the first characterisation of small RNAs present in honey bee reproductive tissues: ovaries, spermatheca, semen, fertilised and unfertilised eggs, and testes. We show that semen contains fewer piRNAs relative to eggs and ovaries, and that piRNAs and miRNAs which map antisense to genes involved in DNA regulation and developmental processes are differentially expressed between tissues. tRNA fragments are highly abundant in semen and have a similar profile to those seen in semen in other animals. Intriguingly we find abundant piRNAs that target the sex determination locus, suggesting that piRNAs may play a role in honey bee sex determination. We conclude that small RNAs play a fundamental role in honey bee gametogenesis and reproduction and provide a plausible mechanism for parent-of origin-effects on gene expression and reproductive physiology.",

These DEGs were subsequently investigated by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network were constructed and analyzed. Hub genes were validated by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. In total, 958 DEGs were identified, of which 480 were up regulated and 478 were down regulated.

    "abstract": "Insect wings are heterogeneous structures, with flexural rigidity varying one to two orders of magnitude over the wing surface. This heterogeneity influences the deformation the flapping wing experiences during flight. However, it is not well understood how this flexural rigidity gradient affects wing performance. Here, we develop a simplified 2D model of a flapping wing as a pitching, plunging airfoil using the assumed mode method and unsteady vortex lattice method to model the structural and fluid dynamics, respectively. We conduct parameter studies to explore how variable flexural rigidity affects mean lift production, power consumption and the forces required to flap the wing. We find that there is an optimal flexural rigidity distribution that maximizes lift production; this distribution generally corresponds to a 3:1 ratio between the wings flapping and natural frequencies, though the ratio is sensitive to flapping kinematics. For hovering flight, the optimized flexible wing produces 20% more lift and requires 15% less power compared to a rigid wing but needs 20% higher forces to flap. Even when flapping kinematics deviate from those observed during hover, the flexible wing outperforms the rigid wing in terms of aerodynamic force generation and power across a wide range of flexural rigidity gradients. Peak force requirements and power consumption are inversely proportional with respect to flexural rigidity gradient, which may present a trade-off between insect muscle size and energy storage requirements. The model developed in this work can be used to efficiently investigate other spatially variant morphological or material wing features moving forward.",

Most of the existing models neglect the dynamics of TopoII which is characteristics for proteins searching their targets via facilitated diffusion. Here, we show that dynamic binding of TopoII speeds up the topological relaxation of knotted substrates by enhancing the search of the knotted arc. Intriguingly, this in turn implies that the timescale of topological relaxation is virtually independent of the substrate length. We then discover that considering binding biases due to facilitated diffusion on looped substrates steers the sampling of the topological space closer to the boundaries between different topoisomers yielding an optimally fast topological relaxation. We discuss our findings in the context of topological simplification in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM), a tumor of germinal center (GC)-experienced plasma cells, comprises distinct genetic subgroups, such as the t(11;14)/CCND1 and the t(4;14)/MMSET subtype. We have generated subgroup-specific MM models by the GC B cell-specific co-activation of Ccnd1 or MMSET with a constitutively active Ikk2 mutant, mimicking the secondary NF{kappa}B activation frequently seen in human MM. Ccnd1/Ikk2ca and MMSET/Ikk2ca mice developed a pronounced, clonally restricted plasma cell outgrowth with age, accompanied by serum M spikes, bone marrow insufficiency and bone lesions. The transgenic plasma cells could be propagated in vivo and showed transcriptional profiles resembling their human counterparts. Thus, we show that Ccnd1 and MMSET cooperate with NF{kappa}B in MM pathogenesis, considering for the first time the genetic heterogeneity of MM for the generation of preclinical models.",

    "abstract": "While many structural and biochemical changes in the brain have been previously associated with aging, the findings concerning electrophysiological signatures, reflecting functional properties of neuronal networks, remain rather controversial. To try resolve this issue, we took advantage of a large population study (N=1703) and comprehensively investigated the association of multiple EEG biomarkers (power of alpha and theta oscillations, individual alpha peak frequency (IAF), the slope of 1/f power spectral decay), aging, and aging and cognitive performance. Cognitive performance was captured with three factors representing processing speed, episodic memory, and interference resolution. Our results show that not only did IAF decline with age but it was also associated with interference resolution over multiple cortical areas. To a weaker extent, 1/f slope of the PSD showed age-related reductions, mostly in frontal brain regions. Finally, alpha power was negatively associated with the speed of processing in the right frontal lobe, despite the absence of age-related alterations. Our results thus demonstrate that multiple electrophysiological features, as well as their interplay, should be considered when investigating the association between age, neuronal activity, and cognitive performance.",

    "abstract": "Genetic disorders which present during development make treatment strategies particularly challenging because there is a need to disentangle primary pathophysiology from downstream dysfunction caused at key developmental stages. To provide a deeper insight into this question, we studied a mouse model of X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS), an early onset inherited condition caused by mutations in the RS1 gene encoding retinoschisin (RS1) and characterized by cystic retinal lesions and early visual deficits. Using an unbiased approach in expressing the fast intracellular calcium indicator GCaMP6f in neuronal, glial, and vascular cells of the retina of mice lacking RS1, we found that initial cyst formation is paralleled by the appearance of aberrant spontaneous neuro-glial signals as early as postnatal day 13. These presented as glutamate-driven wavelets of neuronal activity and sporadic radial bursts of activity by Muller glia, spanning all retinal layers and disrupting light-induced signaling. This study highlights a critical role for RS1 in early retinal development with a potential to disrupt circuit formation to central targets. Additionally, it confers a functional role to RS1 beyond the scope of an adhesion molecule and identifies an early onset for dysfunction, a potential temporal target for therapeutic intervention and diagnosis.\n\nSignificance Statement/ HighlightsO_LIPhotoreceptor inner segments express Rs1 at P5, after which RS1 protein is detected in the inner segments by P9 and throughout the retina at later ages, with structural abnormalities observed by optical coherence tomography at P13 in Rs1 mutant mouse models.\nC_LIO_LIAberrant glutamate-driven wavelets identified by GCaMP6f-based analyses are a novel pathophysiological feature of RS1 deficient mice that emerge after maximal RS1 expression.\nC_LIO_LIMuller glia display abnormal radial glutamate-driven coordinated and sporadic bursts of activity in RS1-deficient mice.\nC_LIO_LIThese data identify a novel pathophysiological feature of RS1-deficient mice and define a window where treatments might be most effective.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/457777v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f27eborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@55e5a4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1577435org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8e55b3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Generation of T cell memory is impaired, while a low-inflammatory state is induced, in part due to effector T cells. To determine whether age-associated changes in T cell fate decisions occur early after T cell activation, we profiled the longitudinal transcriptional and epigenetic landscape induced by TCR stimulation comparing naive CD4+ T cells from young and older adults. In spite of attenuated TCR signaling, activation-induced remodeling of the epigenome increased with age, culminating in heightened BATF and BLIMP1 activity. Single cell studies, integrating ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data, identified increases in dysfunctional and in effector T cells and a decrease in BACH2-expressing memory cell precursors.

Our results show that blue mussels reduced clearance rates by more than 30% in presences of parasites. The reduced filtration activity resulted in lower infection rates in experimental mussels.

The current study obtained simultaneous recordings between CA1 and CA3 in young and aged rats to examine sharp-wave/ripple characteristics in both regions in relation to age. While CA1 ripple frequency was reduced with age, there were no age differences in CA3 ripples. In aged, but not young, rats there was also a significant increase in the probability of CA3 and CA1 ripples co-occurring between the pre- and post-behavior rest epochs. Moreover, in both age groups, CA1 ripples that co-occurred with a CA3 ripple had increased frequency, power, and duration.

In this study, we investigated the short and long-term effects of pulsed laser induced phototoxicity. We used bulk RNA sequencing, quantitative measurement of cell proliferation, and measurement of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to assess phototoxic effects, at different time scales, for a range of laser excitation settings relevant to SRS imaging. We define a range of laser excitation settings for which there was no significant ROS generation, differential gene expression, or change in proliferation rates of mouse Neuro2A cells. Changes in proliferation rate and ROS generation were observed under imaging conditions with an excitation intensity of over 600 mW/m2. Repeated imaging of the same field of view at this excitation intensity of over 600 mW/m2 resulted in visual damage to N2A cells. Laser induced perturbations in live cells may impact downstream measurements of cell state including subsequent imaging or molecular measurements. This study provides guidance for imaging parameters that minimize photo-induced perturbations in SRS microscopy to ensure accurate interpretation of experiments with time-lapse imaging or with paired measurements of imaging and sequencing on the same cells.",

    "abstract": "Cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry (XL-MS) provides a wealth of information about the 3D structure of proteins and their interactions. We introduce MaxLynx, a novel computational proteomics workflow for XL-MS integrated into the MaxQuant environment. It is applicable to non-cleavable and MS-cleavable cross linkers. For both we have generalized the Andromeda peptide database search engine to efficiently identify cross-linked peptides. For non-cleavable peptides, we implemented a novel di-peptide Andromeda score, which is the basis for a computationally efficient N-squared search engine. Additionally, partial scores summarize the evidence for the two constituents of the di-peptide individually. A posterior error probability based on total and partial scores is used to control false discovery rates. For MS-cleavable cross linkers a scoring of signature peaks is combined with the conventional Andromeda score on the cleavage products. The MaxQuant 3D-peak detection was improved to ensure more accurate determination of the monoisotopic peak of isotope patterns for heavy molecules, which cross-linked peptides typically are. A wide selection of filtering parameters can replace manual filtering of identifications, which is often necessary when using other pipelines. On benchmark datasets of synthetic peptides, MaxLynx outperforms all other tested software on data for both types of cross linkers as well as on a proteome-wide dataset of cross-linked D. melanogaster cell lysate. The workflow also supports ion-mobility enhanced MS data. MaxLynx runs on Windows and Linux, contains an interactive viewer for displaying annotated cross-linked spectra and is freely available at https://www.maxquant.org/.",

Enhancers controlled gene expression frequency, as predicted by the binary model of enhancer action, and enhancer deletion converted the broadly expressed Nkg2d into an RME gene, recapitulating natural variegation. The results suggested that RME is a consequence of general enhancer properties and therefore many genes may be subject to some degree of RME, which was borne out by analysis of a panel of genes previously thought to be universally expressed within defined hematopoietic lineages: Nkg2d, Cd45, Cd8a and Thy1.

Defective axis morphogenesis impairs homolog pairing, synapsis, and recombination. We find that axis assembly in C. elegans is promoted by DNA Damage Response (DDR) signaling activated at meiotic entry. Central to this regulation is downregulation of the cohesin release factor WAPL-1 by the DDR transducer kinase ATM-1, which is activated by the meiotic kinase CHK-2. Additional cohesin regulators, including ECO-1 and PDS-5, also contribute to stabilizing axis-associated cohesins. We find that downregulation of WAPL by ATM also promotes cohesin enrichment at DNA damage foci in cultured mammalian cells. Our findings reveal that the DDR and Wapl play conserved roles in cohesin regulation in meiotic prophase and proliferating cells.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryDNA Damage Response kinase ATM phosphorylates WAPL to promote meiotic chromosome axis assembly and DNA repair",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a major adult-onset neurodegenerative condition with no available treatment. Compelling reports point amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) as the main etiologic agent that triggers AD. Although there is extensive evidence of detrimental crosstalk between A{beta} and microglia that contributes to neuroinflammation in AD, the exact mechanism leading to neuron death remains unknown. Using postmortem human AD brain tissue, we show that A{beta} pathology is associated with the necroptosis effector pMLKL. Moreover, we found that the burden of A{beta}o correlates with the expression of key markers of necroptosis activation. Additionally, inhibition of necroptosis by pharmacological or genetic means, reduce neurodegeneration and memory impairment triggered by A{beta}o in mice. Since microglial activation is emerging as a central driver for AD pathogenesis, we then tested the contribution of microglia to the mechanism of A{beta}o-mediated necroptosis activation in neurons. Using an in vitro model, we show that conditioned medium from A{beta}o-stimulated microglia elicited necroptosis in neurons through activation of TNF- signaling, triggering extensive neurodegeneration. Notably, necroptosis inhibition provided significant neuronal protection. Together, these findings suggest that A{beta}o-mediated microglia stimulation in AD contributes to necroptosis activation in neurons and neurodegeneration. As necroptosis is a druggable degenerative mechanism, our findings might have important therapeutic implications to prevent the progression of AD.",

    "abstract": "The role of alternative promoter usage in tissue specific gene expression has been well established, however, its role in complex diseases is poorly understood. We performed cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) tag sequencing from the left ventricle (LV) of a rat model of hypertension, the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), and a normotensive strain, the Brown Norway (BN) to understand role of alternative promoter usage in complex disease. We identified 26,560 CAGE-defined transcription start sites (TSS) in the rat LV, including 1,970 novel cardiac TSS resulting in new transcripts. We identified 27 genes with alternative promoter usage between SHR and BN which could lead to protein isoforms differing at the amino terminus between two strains. Additionally, we identified 475 promoter switching events where a shift in TSS usage was within 100bp between SHR and BN, altering length of the 5 UTR. Genomic variants located in the shifting promoter regions showed significant allelic imbalance in F1 crosses, confirming promoter shift. We found that the insulin receptor gene (Insr) showed a switch in promoter usage between SHR and BN in heart and liver. The Insr promoter shift was significantly associated with insulin levels and blood pressure within a panel of BXH/HXB recombinant inbred (RI) rat strains. This suggests that the hyperinsulinemia due to insulin resistance might lead to hypertension in SHR. Our study provides a preliminary evidence of alternative promoter usage in complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian circadian clock exerts substantial control of daily gene expression through cycles of DNA binding. Understanding of mechanisms driving the circadian clock is hampered by lack of quantitative data, without which predictive mathematical models cannot be developed. Here we develop a quantitative understanding of how a finite pool of BMAL1 protein can regulate thousands of target sites over daily time scales. We have used fluorescent correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to track dynamic changes in CRISPR-modified fluorophore-tagged proteins in time and space in single cells across SCN and peripheral tissues. We determine the contribution of multiple rhythmic processes in coordinating BMAL1 DNA binding, including the roles of cycling molecular abundance, binding affinities and two repressive modes of action. We find that nuclear BMAL1 protein numbers determine corresponding nuclear CLOCK concentrations through heterodimerization and define a DNA residence time of 2.6 seconds for this complex. Repression of CLOCK:BMAL1 is in part achieved through rhythmic changes to BMAL1:CRY1 affinity as well as a high affinity interaction between PER2:CRY1 which mediates CLOCK:BMAL1 displacement from DNA. Finally, stochastic modelling of these data reveals a dual role for PER:CRY complexes in which increasing concentrations of PER2:CRY1 promotes removal of BMAL1:CLOCK from genes consequently enhancing ability to move to new target sites.",

    "abstract": "Familial cardiomyopathy is a precursor of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Over the past several decades, researchers have discovered numerous gene mutations primarily in sarcomeric and cytoskeletal proteins causing two different disease phenotypes: hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathies. However, molecular mechanisms linking genotype to phenotype remain unclear. Here, we employ a systems approach by integrating experimental findings from preclinical studies (e.g., murine data) into a cohesive signaling network to scrutinize genotype to phenotype mechanisms. We developed an HCM/DCM signaling network model utilizing a logic-based differential equations approach and evaluated model performance in predicting experimental data from four contexts (HCM, DCM, pressure overload, and volume overload). The model has an overall prediction accuracy of 83.8%, with higher accuracy in the HCM context (90%) than DCM (75%). Global sensitivity analysis identifies key signaling reactions, with calcium-mediated myofilament force development and calcium-calmodulin kinase signaling ranking the highest. A structural revision analysis indicates potential missing interactions that primarily control calcium regulatory proteins, increasing model prediction accuracy. Combination pharmacotherapy analysis suggests that downregulation of signaling components such as calcium, titin and its associated proteins, growth factor receptors, ERK1/2, and PI3K-AKT could inhibit myocyte growth in HCM. In experiments with patient-specific iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (MLP-W4R;MYH7-R723C iPSC-CMs), combined inhibition of ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT rescued the HCM phenotype, as predicted by the model. In DCM, PI3K-AKT-NFAT downregulation combined with upregulation of Ras/ERK1/2 or titin or Gq protein could ameliorate cardiomyocyte morphology. The model results suggest that HCM mutations that increase active force through elevated calcium sensitivity could increase ERK activity and decrease eccentricity through parallel growth factors, Gq-mediated, and titin pathways. Moreover, the model simulated the influence of existing medications on cardiac growth in HCM and DCM contexts. This HCM/DCM signaling model demonstrates utility in investigating genotype to phenotype mechanisms in familial cardiomyopathy.",

Here, we demonstrate that the coordinated actions of two ion channels, Kv4.3 and BKCa1.1, control the pattern of dopamine neuron firing and dopamine release on different time scales to regulate separate phases of reinforced behavior in mice. Inactivation of Kv4.3 in VTA dopamine neurons increases ex vivo pacemaker activity and excitability that is associated with increased in vivo ramping dynamics prior to lever press in a learned instrumental response paradigm. Loss of Kv4.3 enhances performance of the learned response and facilitates extinction. In contrast, loss of BKCa1.1 increases burst firing and phasic dopamine release that enhances learning of an instrumental response. Inactivation of BKCa1.1 enhances extinction burst lever pressing in early extinction training that is associated with increased reward prediction error signals. These data demonstrate that temporally distinct patterns of dopamine release are governed by the intrinsic regulators of the cell to shape behavior.\n\nTeaserWe show that ion channels in midbrain dopamine neurons are critical for patterning action potential firing at the cell body and governing neurotransmitter release to regulate reinforcement learning.",

Here, we report that herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection caused the release of cGAS from the chromatin into the nuclear soluble fraction. Like its cytosolic counterpart, the leaked nuclear soluble cGAS could sense viral DNA, produce cGAMP, and induce mRNA expression of type I IFN and interferon-stimulated genes. Furthermore, the nuclear cGAS limited HSV-1 infection.

Fluorescent tracers injected into the cisterna magna of mice travel through hundreds of sub-millimeter skull channels into the calvarial marrow. During meningitis, bacteria usurp this perivascular route to infect the skulls hematopoietic niches and initiate cranial hematopoiesis ahead of remote tibial sites.

    "abstract": "Microorganisms cooperate with each other to protect themselves from environmental stressors. An extreme case of such cooperation is regulated cell death for the benefit of other cells. Dying cells can provide surviving cells with nutrients or induce their stress-response by transmitting an alarm signal; however, the role of dead cells in microbial communities is unclear. Here we searched for types of stressors the protection from which can be achieved by death of a subpopulation of cells. Thus, we compared the survival of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells upon exposure to various stressors in the presence of additionally supplemented living versus dead cells. We found that dead cells contribute to yeast community resistance against macrolide antifungals (e.g. amphotericin B [AmB] and filipin) to a greater extent than living cells. Dead yeast cells absorbed more macrolide filipin than control cells because they exposed intracellular sterol-rich membranes. We also showed that, upon the addition of lethal concentrations of AmB, supplementation with AmB-sensitive cells but not with AmB-resistant cells enabled the survival of wild-type cells. Together, our data suggests that cell-to-cell heterogeneity in sensitivity to AmB can be an adaptive mechanism helping yeast communities to resist macrolides, which are naturally occurring antifungal agents.\n\nImportanceEukaryotic microorganisms harbour elements of programmed cell death (PCD) mechanisms that are homologous to the PCD of multicellular metazoa. However, it is still debated whether microbial PCD has an adaptive role or the processes of cell death are an aimless operation in self-regulating molecular mechanisms. Here, we demonstrated that dying yeast cells provide an instant benefit for their community by absorbing macrolides, which are bacteria-derived antifungals. Our results illustrate the principle that the death of a microorganism can contribute to the survival of its kin and suggest that early plasma membrane permeabilization improves community-level protection. The latter makes a striking contrast to the manifestations of apoptosis in higher eukaryotes, the process by which plasma membranes maintain integrity.",

    "abstract": "Cardiomyopathy is an irreparable loss and novel strategies are needed to induce resident cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) proliferation in situ to enhance the possibility of cardiac regeneration. Here we sought to identify the potential roles of glycogen synthase kinase-3{beta} (GSK-3{beta}), a critical regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation, in CPC proliferation post-myocardial infarction (MI).\n\nCardiomyocyte-specific conditional GSK-3{beta} knockout (cKO) and littermate control mice were employed and challenged with MI. Though cardiac left ventricular chamber dimension (LVID) and contractile functions were comparable at two-week post-MI, cKO mice displayed significantly preserved LV chamber and contractile function vs. control mice at four-weeks post-MI. Consistent with protective phenotypes, an increased percentage of c-kit-positive cells (KPCs) were observed in the cKO hearts at four and six-weeks post-MI which was accompanied by increased levels of cardiomyocyte proliferation. Further analysis revealed that the observed increased number of KPCs in the ischemic cKO hearts was mainly from a cardiac lineage as the majority of identified KPCs were negative for the hematopoietic lineage marker, CD45. Mechanistically, cardiomyocyte-GSK-3{beta} profoundly suppresses the expression and secretion of growth factors, including basic-FGF angiopoietin-2, erythropoietin, stem cell factor (SCF), PDGF-BB, G-CSF, and VEGF, post-hypoxia.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings strongly suggest that loss of cardiomyocyte-GSK-3{beta} promotes cardiomyocyte and resident CPC proliferation post-MI. The induction of cardiomyocyte and CPC proliferation in the ischemic cKO hearts is potentially regulated by autocrine and paracrine signaling governed by dysregulated growth factors post-MI. A strategy to inhibit cardiomyocyte GSK-3{beta} could be helpful for the promotion of in situ cardiac regeneration post-ischemic injury.",

Yet, our understanding of how stressors affect drone fecundity and physiology is presently limited. We investigated sex biases in susceptibility to abiotic stressors (cold stress, topical imidacloprid exposure, and topical exposure to a realistic cocktail of pesticides), and we found that drones were more sensitive to cold and imidacloprid exposure but the cocktail was not toxic at the concentrations tested. We corroborated this lack of apparent toxicity with in-hive cocktail exposures via pollen feeding. We then used quantitative proteomics to investigate protein expression profiles in the hemolymph of topically exposed workers and drones, and we show that drones express surprisingly high levels of putative stress response proteins relative to workers. Drones apparently invest in strong constitutive expression of damage-mitigating proteins for a wide range of stressors, yet they are still sensitive to stress when challenged. The robust expression of stress-response proteins suggests that drone stress tolerance systems are fundamentally rewired relative to workers, and their susceptibility to stress depends on more than simply gene dose or deleterious recessive alleles.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome segregation requires both the separation of sister chromatids and the sustained condensation of chromatids during anaphase. In yeast cells, cohesin is not only required for sister chromatid cohesion but also plays a major role in determining the structure of individual chromatids in metaphase. Separase cleavage is thought to remove all cohesin complexes from chromosomes to initiate anaphase. It is thus not clear how the length and organisation of segregating chromatids are maintained during anaphase in the absence of cohesin. Here we show that degradation of cohesin at the anaphase onset causes aberrant chromatid segregation. Hi-C analysis on segregating chromatids demonstrates that cohesin depletion causes loss of intrachromatid organisation. Surprisingly, TEV-mediated cleavage of cohesin does not dramatically disrupt chromatid organisation in anaphase, explaining why bulk segregation is achieved. In addition, we identified a small pool of cohesin complexes bound to telophase chromosomes in wildtype cells and show that they play a role in the organisation of centromeric regions. Our data demonstrate that in yeast cells, cohesin function is not over in metaphase, but extends to the anaphase period when chromatids are segregating.\n\nOne sentence summaryCohesin complexes on yeast chromosomes provide organisation to segregating chromatids.",

Animals either regrew forelimbs normally (control) or were injected with a TRPV4 agonist to impair chondrocyte mechanosensitivity during joint morphogenesis. We quantified growth and shape in regrown humeri from whole mount light sheet fluorescence images of the regenerated limbs. Results revealed statistically significant differences in morphology and cell proliferation between groups, indicating that mechanical stimuli play a role in the shaping of joints. We simulated local tissue growth in a finite element model with a biological contribution to growth proportional to chondrocyte density, and a mechanical contribution to growth proportional to fluid pressure. Computational predictions agreed with experimental outcomes, suggesting that interstitial pressure driven from cyclic mechanical stimuli promotes local tissue growth. Predictive computational models informed by experimental findings allow us to explore potential physical mechanisms involved in tissue growth to advance our understanding of the mechanobiology of joint morphogenesis.",

Despite their shared developmental origin, adult endothelial cells (ECs) and muscle stem cells (MuSCs) (satellite cells) have been thought to possess distinct gene signatures and signaling pathways. Here we shift this paradigm by uncovering how adult MuSC behavior is affected by the expression of a subset of EC transcripts. We used several computational analyses including single-cell RNAseq to show that MuSCs express low levels of canonical EC markers. We demonstrate that MuSC survival is regulated by one such prototypic endothelial signaling pathway (VEGFA-FLT1). Using pharmacological and genetic gain- and loss-of-function studies, we identify the FLT1-AKT1 axis as the key effector underlying VEGFA-mediated regulation of MuSC survival. All together, our data support that the VEGFA-FLT1-AKT1 pathway promotes MuSC survival during muscle regeneration, and highlights how the minor expression of select transcripts is sufficient for affecting cell behavior.",

We previously reported that humans with craniosynostosis and mutations in TWIST1 have dural venous sinus malformations. It is still unknown whether meningeal lymphatic networks, which are patterned alongside the venous sinuses, are also affected. Using a novel skull flat mounting technique, we show that the growth and expansion of meningeal lymphatics are perturbed in Twist1 craniosynostosis models. Changes to the local meningeal environment, including hypoplastic dura and venous malformations, affect the ability of lymphatic networks to sprout and remodel. Dorsal networks along the transverse sinus are hypoplastic with reduced branching. By contrast, basal networks closer to the skull base are more variably affected, showing exuberant growth in some animals suggesting they are compensating for vessel loss in dorsal networks. Injecting molecular tracers into cerebrospinal fluid reveals significantly less drainage to the deep cervical lymph nodes, indicative of impaired lymphatic function. Collectively, our results show that meningeal lymphatic development is hindered in craniosynostosis, suggesting central nervous system waste clearance may be impeded.",

    "abstract": "Metabolism is highly interconnected and also has profound effects on other cellular processes. However, the interactions between metabolites and proteins that mediate this connectivity are frequently low affinity and difficult to discover, hampering our understanding of this important area of cellular biochemistry. Therefore, we developed the MIDAS platform, which can identify protein-metabolite interactions with great sensitivity. We analyzed 33 enzymes from central carbon metabolism and identified 830 protein-metabolite interactions that were mostly novel, but also included known regulators, substrates, products and their analogs. We validated previously unknown interactions, including two atomic-resolution structures of novel protein-metabolite complexes. We also found that both ATP and long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs inhibit lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), but not LDHB, at physiological concentrations in vitro. Treating cells with long-chain fatty acids caused a loss of pyruvate/lactate interconversion, but only in cells reliant on LDHA. We propose that these regulatory mechanisms are part of the metabolic connectivity that enables survival in an ever-changing nutrient environment, and that MIDAS enables a broader and deeper understanding of that network.",

Current approaches to QC implicitly assume that datasets are comprised of one celltype, potentially resulting in biased exclusion of rare celltypes. We introduce SampleQC, which robustly fits a Gaussian mixture model across multiple samples, and improves sensitivity and reduces bias compared to current approaches. We show via simulations that SampleQC is less susceptible to exclusion of rarer celltypes. We also demonstrate SampleQC on a complex real dataset (867k cells over 172 samples).

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) orchestrates spatio-temporal expression of genes to generate cellular responses for survival. The transcription factors (TF) regulating expression of their target genes (TG) are the fundamental units of TRN. Several databases have been developed to catalogue human TRN based on low- and high-throughput experimental and computational studies considering their importance in understanding cellular physiology. However, literature lacks comparative assessment on the strength and weakness of each database. In this study, we compared over 2.2 million regulatory pairs between 1,379 TF and 22,518 TG assembled from 14 data resources. Our study reveals that the TF and TG were common across data resources but not their regulatory pairs. We observed that the TF and TG of the regulatory pairs showed weak expression correlation, significant gene ontology overlap, co-citations in PubMed and low numbers of TF-TG pairs representing transcriptional repression relationships. Furthermore, each TF-TG regulatory pair assigned a combined confidence score reflecting its reliability based on its presence in multiple databases and co-expression. The TRN containing 2,246,598 TF-TG pairs, of which, 44,284 with the information on TFs activating or repressing effects on their TG is available upon request. This study brings the information about transcriptional regulation scattered over the literature and databases at one place in the form of one of the most comprehensive and complete human TRNs assembled to date, which will be a valuable resource for benchmarking TRN prediction tools, and to the scientific community working in functional genomics, gene expression and gene regulation analysis.",

Its dimerization and clustering coupled with its lateral mobility are critical for EGFR function, but the contribution of the plasma membrane environment to EGFR function is unknown. Here we show, using single-molecule analysis, that EGFR mobility and clustering are altered by the depletion of cholesterol or sphingomyelin, major lipids of membrane subdomains, causing significant changes in EGFR signaling. When cholesterol was depleted, the subdomain boundary in EGFR diffusion disappeared, the fraction of EGFR pre-dimers was increased, and the ligand-induced phosphorylation of EGFR was enhanced. In addition, the depletion of either lipid prevented the formation of immobile clusters after EGF association and decreased the phosphorylation of downstream proteins. Our results revealed that cholesterol plays dichotomous roles in the signaling pathway of EGFR and that clustering in the membrane subdomains is critical for EGFR signal transduction.",

    "abstract": "Targeting dysregulated Ca2+ signaling in cancer cells is an emerging chemotherapy approach. We previously reported that store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) blockers, such as RP4010, are promising antitumor drugs for esophageal cancer. As a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), afatinib received FDA approval to be used in targeted therapy for patients with EGFR mutation-positive cancers. While preclinical studies and clinical trials have shown that afatinib has benefits for esophageal cancer patients, it is not known whether combination of afatinib and RP4010 could achieve better anticancer effects. Since TKI can alter intracellular Ca2+ dynamics through EGFR/phospholipase C-{gamma} pathway, in this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of afatinib and RP4010 on intracellular Ca2+ oscillations in esophageal cancer cells using both experimental and mathematical simulations. Our mathematical simulation of Ca2+ oscillations could fit well with experimental data responding to aftinib or RP4010, separately or in combination. The results showed that combination of afatinib and RP4010 presented synergistic anticancer effect. This intracellular Ca2+ dynamic-based mathematical simulation approach could be useful for a rapid and cost-effective evaluation of combined targeting therapy drugs.",

    "abstract": "Schrenkiella parvula, a leading extremophyte model in Brassicaceae, can grow and complete its life cycle under multiple environmental stresses, including high salinity. While foundational genomic resources have been created for S. parvula, a comprehensive physiological or structural characterization of its salt stress responses is absent. We aimed to identify the influential traits that lead to stress-resilient growth of this species. We examined salt-induced changes in the physiology and anatomy of S. parvula throughout its lifecycle across multiple tissues. We found that S. parvula maintains or even exhibits enhanced growth during various developmental stages at salt stress levels known to inhibit growth in Arabidopsis and most crops. The resilient growth of S. parvula was associated with key traits that synergistically allow continued primary root growth, expansion of xylem vessels across the root-shoot continuum, and a high capacity to maintain tissue water levels by developing larger and thicker leaves while facilitating continued photosynthesis during salt stress. These traits at the vegetative phase were followed by a successful transition to the reproductive phase via early flowering, development of larger siliques, and production of viable seeds during salt stress. Additionally, the success of self-fertilization during early flowering stages was dependent on salt-induced filament elongation in flowers that aborted in the absence of salt. Our results suggest that the maintenance of leaf water status and enhancement of selfing in early flowers to ensure reproductive success, are among the most influential traits that contribute to the extremophyte lifestyle of S. parvula in its natural habitat.\n\nOne sentence summarySchrenkiella parvula salt-resilient growth is facilitated by uncompromised primary root growth, expansion of xylem vessels, maintenance of leaf water status and photosynthesis, and early flowering.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is one of the greatest threats to global health. New antibacterial strategies are urgently needed, and the development of antibiotic adjuvants that either neutralize resistance proteins or compromise the integrity of the cell envelope is of ever-growing interest. Most available adjuvants are only effective against specific resistance proteins. Here we demonstrate that disruption of cell envelope protein homeostasis simultaneously compromises several classes of resistance determinants. In particular, we find that impairing DsbA-mediated disulfide bond formation incapacitates diverse {beta}-lactamases and destabilizes mobile colistin resistance enzymes. Furthermore, we show that chemical inhibition of DsbA sensitizes multidrug-resistant clinical isolates to existing antibiotics and that the absence of DsbA, in combination with antibiotic treatment, substantially increases the survival of Galleria mellonella larvae infected with multidrug- resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This work lays the foundation for the development of novel antibiotic adjuvants that function as broad-acting resistance breakers.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTDisruption of disulfide bond formation sensitizes resistant Gram- negative bacteria expressing {beta}-lactamases and mobile colistin resistance enzymes to currently available antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Sequence biases at 5 ends of coding sequences differ from those of the remainder of ORFs, reflecting differences in function. Internal sequence biases promote translational efficiency by several mechanisms including correlating codon usage and tRNA concentration. However, the early region may also facilitate translational initiation, establishment of the reading frame, and polypeptide processing. Here we examine the beginnings of the ORFs of an Escherichia coli K12 reference genome. The results extend previous observations of A-richness to include an overabundance of the AAA triplet in all reading frames, consistent with the hypothesis that the beginnings of ORFs contribute to initiation site accessibility. Results are also consistent with the idea that the first two amino acids are under selection because they facilitate solvation of the amino-terminus at the end of the ribosomal exit channel. Moreover, serine is highly overrepresented as the second amino acid, possibly because it can facilitate removal of the terminal formylmethionine. Non-AUG initiation codons are known to be less efficient than AUG at directing initiation, presumably because of relatively weak base pairing to the initiator-tRNA. But non-UAG initiation codons are not followed by unusual 3 nearest neighbor codons. Moreover, the four NUG initiation codons do not differ in their propensity to frameshift in an assay known to be sensitive to base pair strength. Altogether, these data suggest that the 5 ends of ORFs are under selection for several functions, and that initiation codon identity may not be critical beyond its role in initiation.",

In the morphometric mutant etoile, tip growth is slower than in the WT and eventually stops. In this paper, we show that the causal etoile mutation is a null mutation in a bi-domain BAR-RhoGAP gene. By quantitative RT-PCR, we showed that ETOILE is ubiquitously expressed in prostrate filaments of the Ectocarpus sporophyte, and is downregulated in the etoile mutant. We immunolocalised both domains of the protein in WT and etoile, as well as RAC1, the known target of Rho-GAP enzymes. Thus, ETOILE would be localised at the apical cell dome where it would control the localisation of EsRAC1 to the plasma membrane. Actin staining showed that the mutant is not affected in F-actin structures. Overall, these results suggest that in Ectocarpus, BAR-RhoGAP controls tip growth by controlling RAC1 localization and through an actin-independent mechanism.",

A better understanding of how grasslands have responded to past environmental changes will help predict the outcome of current and future environmental changes. Here, we explore the relationship between past atmospheric CO2 and temperature fluctuations and the shifts in diversification rate of grasses (Poaceae) and daisies (Asteraceae), two exceptionally species-rich grassland families ([~]11,000 and [~]23,000 species, respectively). To this end, we developed a novel Bayesian approach that simultaneously estimates diversification-rates through time from time-calibrated phylogenies and correlations between environmental variables and diversification rates. Additionally, we developed a new statistical approach that incorporates the information of the distribution of missing species in the phylogeny. We found strong evidence supporting a simultaneous increase in diversification rates for daisies and grasses after the most significant reduction of atmospheric CO2 in the Cenozoic ([~]34 Mya). The fluctuations of paleo-temperatures, however, appear not to have had a significant relationship with the diversification of these grassland families. Overall, our results shed new light on our understanding of the origin of grasslands in the context of past environmental changes.",

We enhanced EET in engineered strains through systematic expression of electron transfer pathways differing in cytochrome composition, localization and origin. While a hybrid pathway harboring components of an E. coli nitrate reductase and the Mtr complex from the exoelectrogen Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 enhanced EET, the highest efficiency was achieved by implementing the complete Mtr pathway from S. oneidensis MR1 in E. coli. We show periplasmic electron shuttling through overexpression of a small tetraheme cytochrome to be central to the electroactivity of this strain, leading to enhanced degradation of the pollutant methyl orange and significantly increased electrical current to graphite electrodes.",
