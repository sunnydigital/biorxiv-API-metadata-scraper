    "abstract": "Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are DNA viruses that ubiquitously infect humans and have been associated with hyperproliferative lesions. The recently discovered mouse specific papillomavirus, MmuPV1, provides the opportunity to study papillomavirus infections in vivo in the context of a common laboratory mouse model (Mus musculus). To date, a major challenge in the field has been the lack of tools to identify, observe and characterize individually the papillomavirus hosting cells and also trace the progeny of these cells over time.\n\nHere, we present the successful generation of an in vivo lineage-tracing model of MmuPV1-harboring cells and their progeny by means of genetic reporter activation. Following the validation of the system both in vitro and in vivo, we used it to provide a proof-of-concept of its utility. Using flow-cytometry analysis, we observed increased proliferation dynamics and decreased MHC-I cell surface expression in MmuPV1-treated tissues which could have implications in tissue regenerative capacity and ability to clear the virus. This model is a novel tool to study the biology of the MmuPV1 host-pathogen interactions.",

    "abstract": "Human brain development is a complex process where multiple cellular and developmental events are co-ordinated to generate normal structure and function. Alteration in any of these events can impact brain development, manifesting clinically as neurodevelopmental disorders. Human genetic disorders of lipid metabolism often present with features of altered brain function. Lowe syndrome (LS), is a X-linked recessive disease with features of altered brain function. LS results from mutations in OCRL1 that encodes a phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase enzyme. However, the cellular mechanisms by which loss of OCRL1 leads to brain defects remain unknown. Human brain development involves several cellular and developmental features not conserved in other species and understanding such mechanisms remains a challenge. Rodent models of LS have been generated, but failed to recapitulate features of the human disease. Here we describe the generation of human stem cell lines from LS patients. Further, we present biochemical characterization of lipid metabolism in patient cell lines and demonstrate their use as a \"disease-in-a-dish\" model for understanding the mechanism by which loss of OCRL1 leads to altered cellular and physiological brain development.",

Understanding to what extent plasticity and environmental filtering determine variation in ecosystem engineer physical structure is necessary to predict how ecosystem structure may change. Here, we explored coral survival and the plasticity of morphological traits that are critical for habitat provision in coral reefs. We conducted a reciprocal clonal transplant experiment in which branching corals from the genus Porites and Acropora were moved to and from a deep and a shallow site within a lagoon in the Maldives. Survival and trait analyses showed that transplant destination consistently induced the strongest changes, particularly among Acropora spp. The origin of the corals only marginally affected some of the traits. We also detected variation in the way individuals from the same species and site differentiate their shape, showing that traits linked to habitat provision are phenotypically plastic. The results suggest coral phenotypic plasticity plays a stronger role than environmental filtering, in determining zonation of coral morphologies, and consequently the habitats they provide for other taxa.",

However, there has been limited adoption of SEQ in research and clinical settings.\n\nMethodsThe SEQ adapter is a small, battery-powered device that transforms the output of any commercially available electrical stimulator into SEQ stimulation. We examined the output of the adaptor across a range of clinically relevant stimulation pulse parameters to verify the signal integrity preservation ability of the SEQ adapter. Pulse frequency, amplitude, and duration were varied across discrete states between 4-200 Hz, 10-100 mA, and 50-2000 s, respectively.\n\nResultsA total of 420 trials were conducted, with 80 stimulation pulses per trial. The SEQ adapter demonstrated excellent preservation of signal integrity, matching the pulse characteristics of the originating stimulator within 1% error. The SEQ adapter operates as expected at pulse frequencies up to 160 Hz, with a noted failure mode at 200 Hz.\n\nConclusionThe SEQ adapter represents an effective and low-cost solution to increase the utilization of SEQ in existing rehabilitation paradigms.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is a common epigenetic signaling tool and an important biological process which is widely studied in a large array of species. The presence, level, and function of DNA methylation varies greatly across species. In insects, DNA methylation systems are reduced, and methylation rates are often low. Low methylation levels probed by whole genome bisulfite sequencing require great care with respect to data quality control and interpretation. Here we introduce BWASP/R, a complete workflow that allows efficient, scalable, and entirely reproducible analyses of raw DNA methylation sequencing data. Consistent application of quality control filters and analysis parameters provides fair comparisons among different studies and an integrated view of all experiments on one species. We describe the capabilities of the BWASP/R workflow by re-analyzing several publicly available social insect WGBS data sets, comprising 70 samples and cumulatively 147 replicates from four different species. We show that the CpG methylome comprises only about 1.5% of CpG sites in the honeybee genome and that the cumulative data are consistent with genetic signatures of site accessibility and physiological control of methylation levels.\n\nSignificance StatementDNA methylation in the honeybee genome occurs almost entirely at CpG sites. Methylation rates are small compared to rates in mammalian or plant genomes. De novo analysis of all published honeybee methylation studies and statistical modeling suggests that the CpG methylome consists of about only 300,000 sites. The development of a fully reproducible, scalable, portable workflow allows for easy accessible updates of integrative views of all current experiments. The integrated results for the honeybee are consistent with genetic determination of methylation site accessibility by yet uncharacterized sequence features and physiological control of methylation levels at those sites.",

    "abstract": "Cisplatin, 5FU and docetaxel (TPF) are the most common chemotherapy regimen used for advanced OSCC. However, many cancer patients experience relapse, continued tumor growth, and spread due to drug resistance, which leads to treatment failure and metastatic disease. Here, using a CRISPR/Cas9 based kinome knockout screening, Misshapen-like kinase 1 (MINK1) is identified as an important mediator of 5FU resistance in OSCC. Analysis of clinical samples demonstrated significantly higher MINK1 expression in the tumor tissues of chemotherapy non-responder as compared to chemotherapy responders. The nude mice and zebrafish xenograft experiments indicate that knocking out MINK1 restores 5FU mediated cell death in chemoresistant OSCC. An antibody based phosphorylation array screen revealed MINK1 as a negative regulator of p53. Mechanistically, MINK1 modulates AKT phosphorylation at Ser473, which enables p-MDM2 (Ser 166) mediated degradation of p53. We also identified lestaurtinib as a potent inhibitor of MINK1 kinase activity. The patient derived TPF resistant cell based xenograft data suggest that lestaurtinib restores 5FU sensitivity and facilitates a significant reduction of tumor burden. Overall, our study suggests that MINK1 is a major driver of 5FU resistance in OSCC. The novel combination of MINK1 inhibitor lestaurtinib and 5FU needs further clinical investigation in advanced OSCC.",

    "abstract": "In mammals and plants, cytosine DNA methylation is essential for the epigenetic repression of transposable elements and foreign DNA. In plants, DNA methylation is guided by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in a self-reinforcing cycle termed RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). RdDM requires the specialized RNA Polymerase V (Pol V), and the key unanswered question is how Pol V is first recruited to new target sites without preexisting DNA methylation. We find that Pol V follows and is dependent upon the recruitment of an AGO4-clade ARGONAUTE protein, and any siRNA can guide the ARGONAUTE protein to the new target locus independent of preexisting DNA methylation. These findings reject long-standing models of RdDM initiation and instead demonstrate that siRNA-guided ARGONAUTE targeting is necessary, sufficient and first to target Pol V recruitment and trigger the cycle of RdDM at a transcribed target locus, thereby establishing epigenetic silencing.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) encoding methods are increasingly being explored as alternatives to multi-slice two-dimensional (2D) acquisitions in fMRI, particularly in cases where high isotropic resolution is needed. 3D multi-shot EPI is the most popular 3D fMRI acquisition method, but is susceptible to physiological fluctuations which can induce inter-shot phase variations, and thus reducing the achievable tSNR, negating some of the benefit of 3D encoding. This issue can be particularly problematic at ultra-high fields like 7T, which have more severe off-resonance effects. In this work, we aim to improve the temporal stability of 3D multi-shot EPI at 7T by improving its robustness to inter-shot phase variations. We presented a 3D segmented CAIPI sampling trajectory (\"seg-CAIPI\") and an improved reconstruction method based on Hankel structured low-rank matrix recovery. Simulation and in-vivo results demonstrate that the combination of the seg-CAIPI sampling scheme and the proposed structured low-rank reconstruction is a promising way to effectively reduce the unwanted temporal variance induced by inter-shot physiological fluctuations, and thus improve the robustness of 3D multi-shot EPI for fMRI.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA 3D multi-shot EPI sampling trajectory using interleaved ordering along kz and a CAIPI blipping pattern improves robustness to inter-shot phase variations\nC_LIO_LIReconstruction based on Hankel structured low-rank matrix completion can significantly improve the temporal stability of 3D multi-shot acquisitions at 7T\nC_LIO_LI1.5mm resolution brain fMRI data show that ~60% improvement in mean tSNR can be obtained using the proposed method compared to the conventional method\nC_LIO_LI1.8mm resolution brain fMRI data demonstrate that the proposed method allows for 4-fold acceleration without loss of tSNR compared to conventional 3D EPI\nC_LIO_LIPreliminary brainstem fMRI data show that ~40% improvement in mean tSNR can be obtained using the proposed sampling and reconstruction\nC_LI",

Here, we show in awake mice that L2 cells respond rapidly to odors during single sniffs and that LEC is essential for discrimination of odor identity and intensity. Population analyses of L2 ensembles reveals that while rate coding distinguishes odor identity, firing rates are weakly concentration-dependent and changes in spike timing represent odor intensity. L2 principal cells differ in afferent olfactory input and connectivity with local inhibitory circuits and the relative timing of pyramidal and fan cell spikes underlies odor intensity coding. Downstream, intensity is encoded purely by spike timing in hippocampal CA1. Together, these results reveal the unique processing of odor information by parallel LEC subcircuits and highlight the importance of temporal coding in higher olfactory areas.",

    "abstract": "Impact of climate changes on species is expected to be especially visible at the extremities of the species distribution, where they meet sub-optimal conditions. In Mauritania and Iberia, two genetically isolated populations of harbor porpoises form a distinct ecotype and are presumably locally adapted to the upwelling waters. By analyzing the evolution of mitochondrial genetic variation in the Iberian population between two temporal cohorts (1990-2002 vs. 2012-2015), we report a dramatic decrease in genetic diversity. Phylogenetic analyses including neighboring populations identified two porpoises in southern Iberia carrying a divergent haplotype close to the Mauritanian population, yet forming a distinctive lineage. This suggests that Iberian porpoises may not be as isolated as previously thought with immigration from Mauritania or an unknown population in between, but none from the northern ecotype. The rapid decline in the Iberian mitochondrial diversity may be driven by either genetic drift, or by a dramatic decline in census population size possibly resulting from environmental stochasticity, prey depletion, or acute fishery bycatches. These results illustrate the value of genetics time series to inform demographic trends and emphasize the urgent need for conservation measures to ensure the viability of this small harbor porpoise population in Iberia.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed whole genome and RNA sequencing data from 2,733 African American and Hispanic/Latino children to explore ancestry- and heterozygosity-related differences in the genetic architecture of whole blood gene expression. We found that heritability of gene expression significantly increases with greater proportion of African genetic ancestry and decreases with higher levels of Indigenous American ancestry, consistent with a relationship between heterozygosity and genetic variance. Among heritable protein-coding genes, the prevalence of statistically significant ancestry-specific expression quantitative trait loci (anc-eQTLs) was 30% in African ancestry and 8% for Indigenous American ancestry segments. Most of the anc-eQTLs (89%) were driven by population differences in allele frequency, demonstrating the importance of measuring gene expression across multiple populations. Transcriptome-wide association analyses of multi-ancestry summary statistics for 28 traits identified 79% more gene-trait pairs using models trained in our admixed population than models trained in GTEx. Our study highlights the importance of large and ancestrally diverse genomic studies for enabling new discoveries of complex trait architecture and reducing disparities.",

    "abstract": "Long-term evolution experiments (LTEEs) reveal the dynamics of clonal compositions in an evolving bacterial population over time. Accurately inferring the haplotypes - the set of mutations that identify each clone, as well as the clonal frequencies and evolutionary history in a bacterial population is useful for the characterization of the evolutionary pressure on multiple correlated mutations instead of that on individual mutations. Here, we study the computational problem of reconstructing the haplotypes of bacterial clones from the variant allele frequencies (VAFs) observed during a time course in a LTEE. Previously, we formulated the problem using a maximum likelihood approach under the assumption that mutations occur spontaneously, and thus the likelihood of a mutation occurring in a specific clone is proportional to the frequency of the clone in the population when the mutation occurs. We also developed several heuristic greedy algorithms to solve the problem, which were shown to report accurate results of clonal reconstruction on simulated and real time course genomic sequencing data in LTEE. However, these algorithms are too slow to handle sparse time course data when the number of novel mutations occurring during the time course are much greater than the number of time points sampled. In this paper, we present a novel scalable algorithm for clonal reconstruction from sparse time course data. We employed a statistical method to estimate the sampling variance of VAFs derived from low coverage sequencing data and incorporated it into the maximum likelihood framework for clonal reconstruction on noisy sequencing data. We implemented the algorithm (named ClonalTREE2) and tested it using simulated and real sparse time course genomic sequencing data. The results showed that the algorithm was fast and achieved near-optimal accuracy under the maximum likelihood framework for the time course data involving hundreds of novel mutations at each time point. The source code of ClonalTREE2 is available at https://github.com/COL-IU/ClonalTREE2.",

    "abstract": "The fundamental problem of protein biochemistry is to predict protein structure from amino acid sequence. The inverse problem, predicting either entire sequences or individual mutations that are consistent with a given protein structure, has received much less attention even though it has important applications in both protein engineering and evolutionary biology. Here, we ask whether 3D convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) can learn the local fitness landscape of protein structure to reliably predict either the wild-type amino acid or the consensus in a multiple sequence alignment from the local structural context surrounding a site of interest. We find that the network can predict wild type with good accuracy, and that network confidence is a reliable measure of whether a given prediction is likely going to be correct or not. Predictions of consensus are less accurate, and are primarily driven by whether or not the consensus matches the wild type. Our work suggests that high-confidence mis-predictions of the wild type may identify sites that are primed for mutation and likely targets for protein engineering.",

    "abstract": "Translation of messenger RNA is regulated through a diverse set of RNA-binding proteins. A significant fraction of RNA-binding proteins contain prion-like domains which form functional prions. This raises the question of how prions can play a role in translational control. Local control of translation in dendritic spines by prions has been invoked in the mechanism of synaptic plasticity and memory. We show how channeling through diffusion and processive translation cooperate in highly ordered mRNA/prion aggregates as well as in less ordered mRNA/protein condensates depending on their sub-structure. We show the direction of translational control, whether it is repressive or activating, depends on the polarity of the mRNA distribution in mRNA/prion assemblies which determines whether vectorial channeling can enhance recycling of ribosomes. Our model also addresses the effect of changes of substrate concentration in assemblies that have been suggested previously to explain translation control by assemblies through the introduction of a potential of mean force biasing diffusion of ribosomes inside the assemblies. The results from the model are compared with the experimental data on translational control by two functional RNA-binding prions, CPEB involved in memory and Rim4 involved in gametogenesis.\n\nSignificance StatementmRNA/protein assemblies such as functional prions and condensates are involved in locally regulating translation in eukaryotic cells. The mode of regulation depends on the structure of these assemblies. We show that the vectorial processive nature of translation can couple to transport via diffusion so as to repress or activate translation depending on the structure of the RNA protein assembly. We find that multiple factors including diffusivity changes and free energy biases in the assemblies can regulate the translation rate of mRNA by changing the balance between substrate recycling and competition between mRNAs. We mainly focus on the example of CPEB, a functional prion that has been implicated in the mechanism of synaptic plasticity of neurons and in memory.",

We have the objective of domesticating the plant and promote its cultivation and utilization. Seeds were treated with sulphuric acid for early germination and grafted with matured scions suspected to be fruiting for several years. Twenty-two of the seedlings were transplanted on the field at Ho Technical University campus. Unfortunately, only four survived bushfire and destruction by stray animals. Surprisingly, one of the four surviving trees anthesis within twenty-eight months after seed treatment (twenty months after transplanting). This is the earliest ever reported anthesis of baobab. With better agronomic practices such as supplementary irrigation, insect pest control, manuring and protection from stray animals, baobab could start fruiting within two years of planting. This would alleviate fear of long maturity period and motivate farmers to go into baobab plantation. This would help diversify agriculture in many African countries, increase income and food security and contribute towards the attainment of the sustainable development goals of the United Nations.",

To better understand the japonica rice responses to cold stress, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling based quantitative proteomics approach was used to detected changes in protein level. Two-week-old seedlings of the cold tolerance rice variety Kongyu131 were treated at 8{degrees}C for 24, 48 and 72 h, then the total proteins were extracted from tissues and used for quantitative proteomics analysis. A total of 5082 proteins were detected for quantitative analysis, of which 289 proteins were significantly regulated, consisting of 169 uniquely up-regulated proteins and 125 uniquely down-regulated proteins in cold stress groups relative to control group. Functional analysis revealed most of regulation proteins involved in photosynthesis, metabolic pathway, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and carbon metabolism. Western blot analysis showed that protein regulation was consistent with the iTRAQ data. The corresponding genes of 25 regulation proteins were used for quantitative real time PCR analysis, and the results showed that the mRNA level was not always parallel to the corresponding protein level.

    "abstract": "Change in climate of the entire globe due to elevated temperature and minimum annual rainfall in barren zone frequently leads to salinity of soil. The current study was aimed to evaluate the importance of sugar beet extract (SBE) as a bio-stimulant to improve the adverse damages of induced salinity stress (40mM) on growth, oosmolytes and antioxidant defense system of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Pot experiment was carried in green house under different concentrations of SBE (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%) pre-soaked seeds of Hordeum vulgare for 5 hours SBE was analyzed for glycine betaine (100mmol/kg), betalains (1.3mg/l), phenolics (1.30g/100ml), flavonoids (0.59mg/ml), carotenoids (0.23ml/100ml), vitamin E (0.002%), vitamin C (8.04g/100ml), sugar (8g/100ml), protein (1.39mg/100ml), and oxalic acid (38mg/100ml) while Ca (13.72mg/l), Mg (7.121 mg/l) and K (11.45mg/l) contents were also determined. We found significant improvement in germination parameters of Hordeum vulgare L. via SB extract on coefficient of velocity of emergence (CVE), mean emergence time (MET), germination energy (GE), timson germination index (TGI), germination rate index (GRI) and time to 50% emergence (E50) under induced salinity stress. However, photosynthetic pigments, e.g., chlorophyll and carotenoids were enhanced using 40% SB extract, soluble sugar, protein, proline, POD, MDA with 50% SB extract while SOD and H2O2 in 20% SBE, respectively. Our findings suggested that SB extract promotes both agronomical and physiological attributes, is a positive way to enhance our economy by increasing crop yields in arid and semi-arid areas along with plant tolerance to under induced salinity stress.\n\nHighlightsThe recent study is of utmost importance owing to the following reasons:[tpltrtarr] Changes in climatic condition results in salinity, droughts, floods, earthquakes, fluctuation in temperature and other environmental hazards.\n[tpltrtarr]Salinity stress has myriad of damaging effects on crop growth and productivity and becoming a global issue of major concern especially in the Asian countries including Pakistan. Statistical analysis showed that 6.30 million of lands is affected with salinity.\n[tpltrtarr]Barley (Hordeum Vulgare L.) being an important crop of economic and nutritional value has been facing salinity stress condition in Pakistan, resulting in productivity reduction and ultimately paving the way for food scarcity and crippling economy.\n[tpltrtarr]The sole purpose of this research article is to assess and ameliorate the physio-biochemical responses via application of sugar beet extract as bio-stimulants in Barley (Hordeum Vulgare L.) grown under induced salinity stress; in order to cope with the dire consequences of salinity stress especially in the southern areas of Pakistan being badly affected by salt stress.\n[tpltrtarr]Furthermore, there is a great need for adaptive measures suggested by the present research and other findings made by researchers in pursuit of tackling this alarming global menace.",

    "abstract": "It has been estimated that more than 390 million people are infected with Dengue virus every year; around 96 millions of these infections result in clinical pathologies. To date, there is only one licensed viral vector-based Dengue virus vaccine CYD-TDV approved for use in dengue endemic areas. While initially approved for administration independent of serostatus, the current guidance only recommends the use of this vaccine for seropositive individuals. Therefore, there is a critical need for investigating the influence of Dengue virus serostatus and immunological mechanisms that influence vaccine outcome. Here, we provide comprehensive evaluation of sero-status and host immune factors that correlate with robust immune responses to a Dengue virus vector based tetravalent vaccine (TV003) in a Phase II clinical cohort of human participants. We observed that sero-positive individuals demonstrate a much stronger immune response to the TV003 vaccine. Our multi-layered immune profiling revealed that sero-positive subjects have increased baseline/pre-vaccination frequencies of circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells and the Tfh related chemokine CXCL13/BLC. Importantly, this baseline/pre-vaccination cTfh profile correlated with the vaccinees ability to launch neutralizing antibody response against all four sero-types of Dengue virus, an important endpoint for Dengue vaccine clinical trials. Overall, we provide novel insights into the favorable cTfh related immune status that persists in Dengue virus sero-positive individuals that correlate with their ability to mount robust vaccine specific immune responses. Such detailed interrogation of cTfh cell biology in the context of clinical vaccinology will help uncover mechanisms and targets for favorable immuno-modulatory agents.\n\nAuthor summaryDengue virus (DENV) is a worldwide threat that causes significant health and economic burden. Currently, there are several challenges in the development of a DENV vaccine including the existence of four different serotypes all; capable of causing disease and antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). For complete protection, a vaccine must be able to generate neutralizing antibodies against all 4 serotypes to avoid ADE. Currently, there is one licensed DENV vaccine, CYD-TDV (DENGVAXIATM). However, this vaccine is only efficacious in protecting against severe disease in DENV seropositive individuals therefore serostatus effect must be further studied for optimal vaccine design. A subset of CD4+ T cells called T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells have been well known to play a major role in aiding high affinity antibody production. Therefore, we chose to look at subsets of Tfh and the cytokines they produce in human blood that can serve as biomarkers for effective vaccine design. We found that DENV sero-positive participants had increased pre-vaccination frequencies of Tfh cells and higher levels of the Tfh related chemokine CXCL13/BLC that plays a role in directing antigen-specific responses. This pre-vaccination Tfh profile and CXCL13/BLC are then correlated positively with the vaccinees ability to produce neutralizing antibody against all four sero-types (breadth of the Response) of DENV, an important goal for all DENV vaccine trials.",

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid binding proteins are frequently targeted as autoantigens in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other interferon (IFN)-linked rheumatic diseases. The AIM-like receptors (ALRs) are IFN-inducible innate sensors that form supramolecular assemblies along double-stranded DNA of various origins. Here, we identify the ALR Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) as a novel autoantigen in SLE, with similar properties to the established ALR autoantigen interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16). Our SLE cohort revealed a frequent co-occurrence of anti-AIM2, anti-IFI16 and anti-DNA antibodies, and higher clinical measures of disease activity in patients positive for antibodies against these ALRs. We examined neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) as DNA scaffolds on which these antigens might interact in a pro-immune context, finding that both ALRs bind NETs in vitro and in SLE renal tissues. We demonstrate that ALR binding causes NETs to resist degradation by DNase I, suggesting a mechanism whereby extracellular ALR-NET interactions may promote sustained IFN signaling. Our work suggests that extracellular ALRs bind NETs, leading to DNase resistant nucleoprotein fibers that are targeted as autoantigens in SLE.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms by which DNA alleles contribute to disease risk, drug response, and other human phenotypes are highly context-specific, varying across cell types and under different conditions. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are uniquely suited to study these context-dependent effects, but to do so requires cell lines from hundreds or potentially thousands of individuals. Village cultures, where multiple hiPSC lines are cultured and differentiated together in a single dish, provide an elegant solution for scaling hiPSC experiments to the necessary sample sizes required for population-scale studies. Here, we show the utility of village models, demonstrating how cells can be assigned back to a donor line using single cell sequencing, and addressing whether line-specific signaling alters the transcriptional profiles of companion lines in a village culture. We generated single cell RNA sequence data from hiPSC lines cultured independently (uni-culture) and in villages at three independent sites. We show that the transcriptional profiles of hiPSC lines are highly consistent between uni- and village cultures for both fresh (0.46 < R < 0.88) and cryopreserved samples (0.46 < R < 0.62). Using a mixed linear model framework, we estimate that the proportion of transcriptional variation across cells is predominantly due to donor effects, with minimal evidence of variation due to culturing in a village system. We demonstrate that the genetic, epigenetic or hiPSC line-specific effects on gene expression are consistent whether the lines are uni- or village-cultured (0.82 < R < 0.94). Finally, we identify the consistency in the landscape of cell states between uni- and village-culture systems. Collectively, we demonstrate that village methods can be effectively used to detect hiPSC line-specific effects including sensitive dynamics of cell states.",
