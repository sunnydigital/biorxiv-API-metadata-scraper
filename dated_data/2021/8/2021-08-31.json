    "abstract": "Vocal communication is essential for social behaviors in humans and many non-human primates. While the frontal cortex has been shown to play a crucial role in human speech production, its role in vocal production in non-human primates has long been questioned. Recent studies have shown activation in single neurons in the monkey frontal cortex during vocal production in relatively isolated environment. However, little is known about how the frontal cortex is engaged in vocal production in ethologically relevant social context, where different types of vocal signals are produced for various communication purposes. Here we studied single neuron activities and local field potentials (LFP) and in the frontal cortex of marmoset monkeys while the animal engaged in vocal exchanges with other conspecifics in a social environment. Marmosets most frequently produced four types of vocalizations with distinct acoustic structures, three of which were typically not produced in isolation. We found that both single neuron activities and LFP were modulated by the production of each of the four call types. Moreover, the neural modulations in the frontal cortex showed distinct patterns for different call types, suggesting a representation of vocal signal features. In addition, we found that theta-band LFP oscillations were phase-locked to the phrases of twitter calls, which indicates the coordination of temporal structures of vocalizations. Our results suggested important functions of the marmoset frontal cortex in supporting the production of diverse vocalizations in vocal communication.",

    "abstract": "Mental and cognitive health, as well as vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders, involve the interplay of genes with the environment, particularly during sensitive developmental periods. Early-life stress / adversity (ELA) promotes vulnerabilities to stress-related affective disorders, yet it is unknown how a transient ELA dictates life-long neuroendocrine and behavioral reactions to stress. The population of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-expressing neurons that regulate stress-responses is a promising candidate to mediate the enduring influences of ELA on stress-related behavioral and hormonal responses via enduring transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms. Capitalizing on a well-characterized model of ELA, we examined here the ELA-induced changes in gene expression profiles of stress-sensitive CRH-neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of male mice. Given the known heterogeneity of these neuronal populations, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approaches. The use of single-cell transcriptomics identified distinct CRH-expressing neuronal populations characterized by both their gene expression repertoire and their neurotransmitter profiles. Expression changes provoked by ELA clustered around genes involved in neuronal differentiation, synapse formation, altered energy metabolism and the cellular responses to stress and injury. Notably, the ELA-induced transcriptional changes took place primarily in subpopulations of glutamatergic CRH cells. Finally, ELA-induced transcriptional reprogramming of hypothalamic CRH-expressing neurons heralded significant, enduring disruptions of both hormonal and behavioral responses to stress throughout life.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix, mediated by integrin adhesion complexes (IACs), play key roles in cancer progression and metastasis. We investigated systems-level changes in the integrin adhesome during metastatic progression of a patient-derived cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), and found that the actin regulatory protein Mena is enriched in IACs in metastatic cSCC cells. Mena is connected within a subnetwork of actin-binding proteins to the LINC complex component nesprin-2, with which it interacts and co-localises at the nuclear envelope of metastatic cells. Moreover, Mena potentiates the interactions of nesprin-2 with the actin cytoskeleton and the nuclear lamina. CRISPR-mediated Mena depletion causes altered nuclear morphology, reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of the nuclear membrane protein emerin and downregulates expression of the immunomodulatory gene PTX3 via the recruitment of its enhancer to the nuclear periphery. We have uncovered an unexpected novel role for Mena at the nuclear membrane, where it controls the LINC complex, nuclear architecture, chromatin repositioning and cancer gene expression. This is the first description of an adhesion protein regulating gene transcription via direct signalling across the nuclear envelope.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=156 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/458340v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (56K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14e2251org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@af341corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8624dforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@deeb50_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "In addition to central functions in cell adhesion signalling, integrin-associated proteins have wider roles at sites distal to adhesion receptors. In experimentally defined adhesomes, we noticed that there is clear enrichment of proteins that localise to the nucleus, and conversely, we now report that nuclear proteomes contain a class of adhesome components that localise to the nucleus. We here defined a nucleo-adhesome, providing experimental evidence for a remarkable scale of nuclear localisation of adhesion proteins, establishing a framework for interrogating nuclear adhesion protein functions. In adding to nuclear FAKs known roles in regulating transcription, we now show that nuclear FAK regulates expression of many adhesion-related proteins that localise to the nucleus and that nuclear FAK binds to the adhesome component and nuclear protein Hic-5. FAK and Hic-C work together in the nucleus, co-regulating a subset of genes transcriptionally. We describe the first nucleo-adhesome using a squamous cancer cell model, and demonstrate the new principle that there are nuclear adhesion protein subcomplexes that cooperate to control transcription.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=177 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/458428v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c841ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@586a75org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b54439org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@921537_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "AbstractDuring apoptosis, caspases degrade 8 out of [~]30 nucleoporins to irreversibly demolish the nuclear pore complex. However, for poorly understood reasons, caspases are also activated during cell differentiation. Here, we show that sublethal activation of caspases during myogenesis results in the transient proteolysis of four peripheral Nups and one transmembrane Nup. \"Trimmed\" NPCs become nuclear export-defective, and we identified in an unbiased manner several classes of cytoplasmic, plasma-membrane, and mitochondrial proteins that rapidly accumulate in the nucleus. NPC trimming by non-apoptotic caspases was also observed in neurogenesis and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Our results suggest that caspases can reversibly modulate nuclear transport activity, which allows them to function as agents of cell differentiation and adaptation at sublethal levels.",

    "abstract": "The asymmetric distribution of phospholipids in membranes is a fundamental principle of cellular compartmentalization and organization. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a nonbilayer phospholipid that contributes to organelle shape and function, is synthesized at several subcellular localizations via semi-redundant pathways. Previously, we demonstrated in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that the PE synthase Psd1, which primarily operates on the mitochondrial inner membrane, is additionally targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). While ER-localized Psd1 is required to support cellular growth in the absence of redundant pathways, its physiological function at the ER is unclear. We now demonstrate that ER-localized Psd1 sub-localizes on the ER to lipid droplet (LD) attachment sites and further show it is specifically required for normal LD formation. We also find that the role of PSD enzymes in LD formation is conserved in other organisms. Thus, we have identified PSD enzymes as novel regulators of LDs and demonstrate that both mitochondria and LDs in yeast are organized and shaped by the spatial positioning of a single PE synthesis enzyme.",

    "abstract": "One of the most important environmental cues for living organisms is gravity and many developmental processes depend on it. However, when it comes to light microscopy, a majority of studies on these processes work with their objects of interest placed perpendicular to their natural orientation. One reason for that is probably that light microscopes with the required horizontal beampath are either costly or require advanced technical skills. To circumvent these obstacles and make imaging of gravity-dependent processes with a horizontal beampath possible for any lab we developed GraviKit. It converts a standard inverted research microscope into an imaging device with a horizontal beampath with a stage that rotates the sample around the optical axis. Like this, the direction of gravity can be freely chosen during an imaging experiment. The system is easy to implement and suitable for multi-user environments.",

    "abstract": "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a severe form of single ventricle congenital heart disease characterized by the underdevelopment of the left ventricle. Early serial postmortem examinations revealed high rate of coronary artery abnormalities in HLHS fetal hearts, such as thickened wall, kinking arteries and ventriculo-coronary arterial connection. However, it is unclear if there is an intrinsic defect in the HLHS coronary vessels and what the underlying molecular mechanism is.\n\nHere, we profiled both human fetal heart with an underdeveloped left ventricle (ULV) and ECs differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from HLHS patients at single cell resolution. CD144+/NPR3-vascular ECs were selected and further classified as venous, arterial and late arterial subclusters. To study the arterial EC phenotype, we specifically generated iPSC-arterial ECs (AECs, CD34+CDH5+CXCR4+NT5E-/low) derived from three HLHS patients and three age-matched healthy controls.\n\nGene ontology analysis revealed that ULV late arterial EC subcluster showed specific defects in endothelial development, proliferation, and Notch signaling compared to control. Consistently, HLHS iPSCs exhibited impaired AEC differentiation shown as the reduced CXCR4+NT5E-/low AEC progenitor population. Mature HLHS iPSC-AECs also exhibited increased G0/G1 cell cycle arrest with decreased expression of cell cycle related genes (e.g., Ki67, CCND1/2). Additionally, NOTCH targeted genes (e.g., DLL4, HEY1, GJA5) were found suppressed in both ULV AECs and HLHS iPSC-AECs compared to control. We also found the HLHS de novo mutation gene KMT2D directly regulated the transcription of NOTCH targeted genes participating in arterial differentiation and cell proliferation, contributing to the HLHS AEC dysfunctionalities. Intriguingly, the treatment of NOTCH ligand JAG1 improved cell proliferation of HLHS AECs and upregulated G1/S transition genes downstream of NOTCH pathway.\n\nIn summary, our results revealed that KMT2D directly regulated transcription activity of NOTCH signaling, contributing to the poor differentiation and low proliferation of HLHS coronary AECs.",
