    "abstract": "Learning requires neural adaptations thought to be mediated by activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. A relatively non-standard form of synaptic plasticity driven by dendritic plateau potentials has been reported to underlie place field formation in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Here we found that this behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) can also reshape existing place fields via bidirectional synaptic weight changes that depend on the temporal proximity of plateau potentials to pre-existing place fields. When evoked near an existing place field, plateau potentials induced less synaptic potentiation and more depression, suggesting BTSP might depend inversely on postsynaptic activation. However, manipulations of place cell membrane potential and computational modeling indicated that this anti-correlation actually results from a dependence on current synaptic weight such that weak inputs potentiate and strong inputs depress. A network model implementing this bidirectional synaptic learning rule suggested that BTSP enables population activity, rather than pairwise neuronal correlations, to drive neural adaptations to experience.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus is responsible for an ongoing pandemic and concomitant public health crisis around the world. While vaccine development is proving to be highly successful, parallel drug development approaches are also critical in the response to SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viruses. Coronaviruses require Ca2+ ions for host cell entry and we have previously shown that Ca2+ modulates the interaction of the viral fusion peptide with host cell membranes. In an attempt to accelerate drug development, we tested a panel of L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB) drugs currently developed for other conditions, to determine whether they would inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. All the CCBs tested showed varying degrees of inhibition, with felodipine and nifedipine strongly limiting SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection in epithelial lung cells at concentrations where cell toxicity was minimal. Further studies with pseudo-typed particles displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein suggested that inhibition occurs at the level of virus entry. Overall, our data suggest that certain CCBs have potential to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections and are worthy of further examination for possible treatment of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) restricts vascularization and, consequently, access to blood-derived nutrients and oxygen, which impacts tumor growth. Intracellular redox imbalance is another restraint on cellular proliferation, yet it is unknown if the TME contributes to the maintenance of redox homeostasis in PDA cells. Here, we demonstrate that the loss of mitochondrial glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase 2 (GOT2), a component in the malate-aspartate shuttle, disturbs redox homeostasis and halts proliferation of PDA cells in vitro. In contrast, GOT2 inhibition has no effect on in vivo tumor growth or tumorigenesis in an autochthonous model. We propose that this discrepancy is explained by heterocellular pyruvate exchange from the TME, including from cancer associated fibroblasts. More broadly, pyruvate similarly confers resistance to inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of pyruvate uptake or metabolism abrogated pyruvate-mediated alleviation of reductive stress from NADH buildup. In sum, this work describes a potential resistance mechanism mediated by metabolic crosstalk within the pancreatic TME. These findings have important implications for metabolic treatment strategies since several mitochondrial inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for PDA and other cancers.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY PARAGRAPHMaintenance of cardiac function involves a regulatory loop in which electrical excitation causes the heart to contract through excitation-contraction coupling (ECC),1 and the mechanical state of the heart directly affects its electrical activity through mechano-electric coupling (MEC).2 However, in pathological states such as acute ischaemia that alter early or late electro-mechanical coordination (i.e., disturbances in ECC or repolarisation-relaxation coupling, RRC), MEC may contribute to the initiation and / or sustenance of arrhythmias (mechano-arrhythmogenesis).3 The molecular identity of specific factor(s) underlying mechano-arrhythmogenesis in acute ischaemia, however, remain undefined.4 By rapid stretch of rabbit single left ventricular cardiomyocytes, we show that upon ATP-sensitive potassium channel-induced alterations of RRC, overall vulnerability to mechano-arrhythmogenesis is increased, with mechano-sensitive5-11 transient receptor potential kinase ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels12 acting as the molecular driver through a Ca2+-mediated mechanism. Specifically, TRPA1 activation drives stretch-induced excitation and creates a substrate for self-sustained arrhythmias, which are maintained by increased cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations. This TRPA1-dependent mechano-arrhythmogenesis involves microtubules, and can be prevented by block of TRPA1 or buffering of [Ca2+]i. Thus, in cardiac pathologies with disturbed RRC dynamics and / or augmented TRPA1 activity, TRPA1 may represent an anti-arrhythmic target with untapped therapeutic potential.13-17",

In the present study, we tested the performance of a captive group of eight crows, Corvus corone, and ten domestic chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus, in the cylinder task, as a test of motor inhibitory control, and reversal learning as a measure of learning ability and behavioural flexibility. Four crows and nine chickens completed the cylinder task, eight crows and six chickens completed the reversal learning experiment. Crows performed better in the cylinder task compared to chickens. In the reversal learning experiment, species did not significantly differ in the number of trials until learning criterion was reached. Performance in the reversal learning experiment did not correlate with performance in the cylinder task in chickens. Our results suggest crows to possess better motor inhibitory control compared to chickens. In contrast, learning performance in a reversal learning task did not differ between the species, indicating similar levels of behavioural flexibility. Interestingly, we describe notable individual differences in performance. We stress the importance not only to compare cognitive performance between species but also between individuals of the same species when investigating the evolution of cognitive skills.",

    "abstract": "Neurons respond selectively to stimuli, and thereby define a code that associates stimuli with population response patterns. Certain correlations within population responses (noise correlations) significantly impact the information content of the code, especially in large populations. Understanding the neural code thus necessitates response models that quantify the coding properties of modelled populations, while fitting large-scale neural recordings and capturing noise correlations. In this paper we propose a class of response model based on mixture models and exponential families. We show how to fit our models with expectation-maximization, and that they capture diverse variability and covariability in recordings of macaque primary visual cortex. We also show how they facilitate accurate Bayesian decoding, provide a closed-form expression for the Fisher information, and are compatible with theories of probabilistic population coding. Our framework could allow researchers to quantitatively validate the predictions of neural coding theories against both large-scale neural recordings and cognitive performance.",

Despite remarkable advances that have been made in understanding the regulation of gene expression during retinal development, how translational regulation guides retinogenesis is less understood. Here, we conduct a comprehensive translatome and transcriptome survey to the mouse retinogenesis from the embryonic to the adult stages. We discover thousands of genes that have dynamic changes at the translational level and pervasive translational regulation in a developmental stage-specific manner with specific biological functions. We further identify genes whose translational efficiencies are frequently controlled by changing usage in the upstream open reading frames during retinal development. These genes are enriched for biological functions highly important to neurons, such as neuron projection organization and microtubule-based protein transport. Surprisingly, we discover hundreds of previously uncharacterized micropeptides, translated from putative long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs. We validate their protein products in vitro and in vivo and demonstrate their potentials in regulating retinal development. Together, our study presents a rich and complex landscape of translational regulation and provides novel insights into their roles during retinogenesis.",

In an in vitro model of diet-induced steatosis, the pharmacologic inhibition of DPYD resulted in protection from lipid accumulation. Additionally, a gain-of-function mutation of DPYD, created through clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) engineering, led to an increased lipid burden, which was associated with altered mitochondrial functionality in a hepatocarcionma cell line.

    "abstract": "Habitat loss and disease outbreak play a major role in the decline of biodiversity. Habitat degradation is often associated with reduced food resources, which can lead to less investment in host immunity and increased infections. However, pathogens use host resources for replication and pathogen traits, such as infecting hosts internally or short generation times, might allow pathogens to rapidly capitalize on host-consumed nutrients. Thus, it is unclear whether increased food consumption by hosts should reduce or amplify pathogen levels. We conducted experiments on Cuban treefrogs (Osteopilus septentrionalis) to test how food availability affects infection levels of Ranavirus and the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which are both associated with mass die-offs of amphibians. Given that Ranavirus is an endoparasite with a much shorter generation time than the ectoparasitic Bd, we postulated that Ranavirus might be able to capitalize on host-consumed resources more quickly than Bd. We hypothesized that increased food availability to hosts might reduce Bd infections more than Ranavirus infections. As predicted, augmenting food access decreased Bd infection intensity, but increased Ranavirus infection intensity. Future work should assess whether pathogen traits, such as generation time and endo- versus ectoparasitism, generally affect whether food resources more positively benefit hosts or pathogens.",

Existing computational methods for evaluating the effect of sSNVs suffer from the lack of gold-standard training/evaluation data and exhibit over-reliance on sequence conservation signals. We developed synVep (synonymous Variant effect predictor), a machine learning-based method that overcomes both of these limitations. Our training data was a combination of variants reported by gnomAD (observed) and those unreported, but possible in the human genome (generated). We used positive-unlabeled learning to purify the generated variant set of any likely unobservable variants. We then trained two sequential extreme gradient boosting models to identify subsets of the remaining variants putatively enriched and depleted in effect. Our method attained 90% precision/recall on a previously unseen set of variants. Furthermore, although synVep does not explicitly use conservation, its scores correlated with evolutionary distances between orthologs in cross-species variation analysis. synVep was also able to differentiate pathogenic vs. benign variants, as well as splice-site disrupting variants (SDV) vs. non-SDVs. Thus, synVep provides an important improvement in annotation of sSNVs, allowing users to focus on variants that most likely harbor effects.",

    "abstract": "Overtreatment remains the pervasive problem in prostate cancer (PCa) management due to the highly variable and often indolent course. Molecular signatures derived from gene expression profiling have played critical roles in PCa treatment decision-making. Many gene expression signatures have been developed to improve the risk stratification of PCa and some of them have already been translationally applied to clinical practice, however, no comprehensive evaluation was performed to compare the performances of the signatures. In this study, we conducted a systematic and unbiased evaluation of 15 machine learning (ML) algorithms and 30 published PCa gene expression-based prognostic signatures leveraging 10 transcriptomics datasets with 1,558 primary PCa patients from public data repositories. The results revealed that survival analysis models outperformed binary classification models for risk assessment, and the performances of the survival analysis methods - Cox model regularized with ridge penalty (Cox-Ridge) and partial least squares regression for Cox model (Cox-PLS) - were generally more robust than the other methods. Based on the Cox-Ridge algorithm, a few top prognostic signatures that have comparable or even better performances than the commercial panels have been identified. The findings from the study will greatly facilitate the identification of existing prognostic signatures that are promising for further validations in prospective studies and promote the development of robust prognostic models to guide clinical decision-making. Moreover, the study provided a valuable data resource from large primary PCa cohorts, which can be used to develop, validate, and evaluate novel statistical methodologies and molecular signatures to improve PCa management.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase mTORC1 is a central regulator of cell growth and proliferation. mTORC1 is activated on the lysosome surface. However, once mTORC1 is activated, it is unclear whether mTORC1 phosphorylates local lysosomal proteins to regulate specific aspects of lysosomal biology. Through cross-reference analyses of lysosome proteomic with mTORC1-regulated phosphoproteomic, we identified STK11IP as a novel lysosome-specific substrate of mTORC1. mTORC1 directly phosphorylates STK11IP at S404. Knockout of STK11IP led to a robust increase of autophagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagy flux. Dephosphorylation of STK11IP at S404 represses the role of STK11IP as an autophagy inhibitor. Mechanistically, STK11IP binds to V-ATPase, and regulates the activity of V-ATPase. Knockout of STK11IP protects mice from fasting and Methionine and Choline-Deficient Diet (MCD) diet induced fatty liver. Thus, our study demonstrates that STK11IP phosphorylation represents a novel mechanism for mTORC1 to regulate lysosomal acidification, and points to STK11IP as a promising therapeutic target for the amelioration of diseases with aberrant autophagy signaling.",

    "abstract": "Floral transition, regulated by the systemic action of the mobile florigen protein FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), is essential for successful plant reproduction1. How FT controls downstream gene expression remains incompletely understood, although it relies on the florigen activation complex (FAC), a core component of FT function2-4. The FAC is a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator of genes encoding MADS-box transcription factors critical to reproductive development and consists of florigen FT; a scaffold 14-3-3 protein that is a key component for complex assembly; and FD, a basic leucine-zipper protein that recruits the FAC to DNA. Here we report that the FAC exhibits phase separation. In rice shoot apical meristem cells, rice florigen Heading date 3a (Hd3a) fused to the green fluorescent protein formed speckles in the nucleus. The FAC speckle is formed in a FAC-dependent manner in tobacco cells. Recombinant Hd3a, but not OsFD1, phase-separated in vitro, and this effect was enhanced in the presence of 14-3-3 protein. Furthermore, mutations affecting functionally important residues in the pocket region or C-terminal disordered region of Hd3a affected FAC phase separation, providing a biochemical framework for the proteins effect on flowering. The ability to form condensates via phase transition represents a previously unknown mechanism for gene activation by the FAC.",

    "abstract": "Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) is an important freshwater fisheries resource and popular recreational fishing species in Japan, lives for only one year, and has a single breeding season. To supplement increased recreational fishing demand for this species, huge numbers of wild-born landlocked juveniles have been translocated from Lake Biwa into most Japanese rivers for more than 100 generations. Hatchery-reared juveniles born from captive-reared parents for more than 30 generations have also been extensively released. Previous studies have reported that landlocked and amphidromous forms of Ayu easily hybridise, but survival of landlocked larvae could be very low in seawater, leading to a general consensus among scientists, hatchery managers, and commercial and recreational fishers that the reproductive success of landlocked Ayu is very low, or even 0 in translocated rivers. Despite this, limited information exists regarding the reproductive success of landlocked Ayu in translocated rivers, and no study has evaluated the effects of translocation on population structure. Demonstrating that hybridisation occurs between the two forms is central to future management and conservation of this specie. To address this issue, a comprehensive literature search was undertaken, and three published genetic data sets are analysed. Analyses provide strong evidence for very high gene flow between populations, but population structure has been retained in several regions, and several populations are nested. Allele frequencies are similar in amphidromous and landlocked forms. Genetic diversity is homogeneous in amphidromous populations. Bayesian admixture analysis infers widespread introgression in Japanese rivers, with a mean introgression proportion of 24 {+/-} 8%. Maximum likelihood admixture graphs detect two migration events from Lake Biwa to anadromous populations. Analyses consistently indicate that hybridisation between translocated landlocked juveniles and native amphidromous Ayu occurs throughout Japanese rivers.",

    "abstract": "Neurons have become highly diverse in cell size, morphology, phenotype and function in mammalian evolution, whereas glial cells are much less varied in size and types across species. This difference in diversity suggests that neuron-specific coding and regulatory sequences have admitted more variation in evolution, that is, are less evolutionarily conserved than those expressed in glial cells. Here we calculate values of dN/dS from Ensembl98 for coding sequences expressed specifically in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and endothelial cells in the brain across 92 mammalian species with reference to either mouse or human. Surprisingly, we find that protein-coding sequences that are specifically expressed in neurons are far less variable than those specific to other cell types in the brain. We next analyze phastCons values of neuronal and non-neuronal regulatory sequences and find that neuronal cis-regulatory DNA elements are more conserved than their non-neuronal counterpart, and neuron-specific promoter sequences are at least as conserved as other cell type-specific promoter sequences. Moreover, neuron-specific coding sequences are as highly conserved across mammalian species as ATPase coding sequences, the benchmark of evolutionary conservation, followed by heart and skeletal muscle-specific sequences. Neuronal diversity in mammalian evolution thus arises despite high levels of negative selection on neuron-specific protein-coding sequences. We propose that such strong evolutionary conservation is imposed by excitability, which continually exposes cells to the risk of excitotoxic death, and speculate that variability of neuronal cell sizes arises as a consequence of variability in levels of activity, possibly constrained by energy supply to the developing brain. In support of this hypothesis, we find, using the Allen Cell Type Database, that larger cortical neurons do have lower firing rates.\n\nSignificance StatementThe majority of cells in the mammalian body, including glial cells in the brain, maintain a constant size across species from mice to elephants. The exception is neurons, whose size (the sum of the soma, axon, and dendrite) varies over 100-fold both within each brain and across species, often becoming larger in larger brains. What evolutionary mechanism allows neurons to be so exceptionally diverse in size? We show that neuron-specific genes are some of the most highly conserved in mammalian evolution, which implicates alternate causes of diversity in neuronal cell size beyond heritable genetics. In addition, we show that firing rates and neuronal cell sizes are negatively correlated. We propose a novel direction of research into how neuronal cell size diversity might be a self-organized response to variations in levels of activity, which are an exclusive property of excitable cells like neurons.",

    "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a chemical found in the Cannabis sativa plant, is a clinically effective antiepileptic drug whose mechanism of action is unknown. Using a fluorescence-based thallium flux assay, we performed a large-scale screen and found enhancement of flux through heterologously-expressed human Kv7.2/7.3 channels by CBD. Using patch clamp recordings, we found that CBD at low concentrations activates Kv7.2/7.3 channels at subthreshold voltages, with 100 nM CBD producing a doubling of current at -50 mV. CBD shifted the voltage-dependence of channels in the hyperpolarizing direction, producing a shift in the midpoint of activation by [~]-14 mV at 300 nM. CBD also effectively enhanced native M-current in both mouse superior cervical ganglion neurons and rat hippocampal neurons. The potent enhancement of Kv2/7.3 channels by CBD seems likely to contribute to its effectiveness as an antiepileptic drug by reducing neuronal hyperexcitability.",

    "abstract": "Mutation of the PKD1 gene, encoding polycystin-1 (PC1), is the primary cause of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. PC1 is an 11-transmembrane domain protein that binds and modulates the activity of multiple heterotrimeric G protein families and is thought to function as a non-canonical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). PC1 shares a conserved GPCR autoproteolysis inducing [GAIN] domain with the adhesion family of GPCRs, that promotes an auto-catalytic, cis-cleavage at the GPCR proteolysis site (GPS) located proximal to the first transmembrane domain. GPS cleavage divides these receptors into two associated  subunits, the extracellular N-terminal (NTF) and transmembrane C-terminal (CTF) fragments. For the adhesion GPCRs, removal of the NTF leads to activation of G protein signaling as a result of the exposure and subsequent intramolecular binding of the extracellular N-terminal stalk of the CTF, i.e., the tethered cryptic ligand or tethered agonist model. Here, we test the hypothesis that PC1-mediated signaling is regulated by an adhesion GPCR-like, tethered agonist mechanism. Using cell-based reporter assays and mutagenesis of PC1 expression constructs, we show that the CTF form of PC1 requires the stalk for signaling activation and synthetic peptides derived from the PC1 stalk sequence can re-activate signaling by a  stalk-less CTF. In addition, we demonstrate that ADPKD-associated missense mutations within the PC1 stalk affect signaling and can inhibit GPS cleavage. These results provide a foundation for beginning to understand the molecular mechanism of G protein regulation by PC1 and suggest that a tethered agonist-mediated mechanism can contribute to PKD pathogenesis.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMutations of the PKD1 gene, encoding polycystin-1, are the predominant cause of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a systemic disease that is the 4th leading cause of kidney failure. Polycystin-1 functions as an atypical GPCR capable of binding or activating heterotrimeric G proteins, which is essential for preventing renal cystogenesis. However, little is known regarding its regulation. Polycystin-1 shares structural features with the Adhesion family of GPCRs. In this work, we combined mutagenesis and cellular signaling assays which demonstrated that constitutive activation of signaling by polycystin-1 involves an Adhesion GPCR-like molecular mechanism. This study provides new knowledge regarding the structure-function relationships of polycystin-1 which will stimulate additional areas of investigation and reveal novel avenues of therapeutic intervention for ADPKD.",

    "abstract": "The CorA family of proteins regulates the homeostasis of divalent metal ions in many bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotic mitochondria, making it an important target in the investigation of the mechanisms of transport and its functional regulation. Although numerous structures of open and closed channels are now available for the CorA family, the mechanism of the transport regulation remains elusive. Here, we investigated the conformational distribution and associated dynamic behaviour of the pentameric Mg2+ channel CorA at room temperature using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). We find that neither the Mg2+-bound closed structure nor the Mg2+-free open forms are sufficient to explain the average conformation of CorA. Our data support the presence of conformational equilibria between multiple states, and we further find a variation in the behaviour of the backbone dynamics with and without Mg2+. We propose that CorA must be in a dynamic equilibrium between different non-conducting states, both symmetric and asymmetric, regardless of bound Mg2+ but that conducting states become more populated in Mg2+-free conditions. These properties are regulated by backbone dynamics and are key to understanding the functional regulation of CorA.",

    "abstract": "The KV7.4 and KV7.5 subtypes of voltage-gated potassium channels are expressed in several tissues where they play a role in physiological processes such as sound amplification in the cochlea and adjusting vascular smooth muscle tone. Therefore, the mechanisms that regulate KV7.4 and KV7.5 channel function are of interest. Here, we study the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on human KV7.4 and KV7.5 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We report that KV7.5 is activated by PUFAs, which shift the V50 of the conductance versus voltage (G(V)) curve towards more negative voltages. This response depends on the charge of the head group as an uncharged PUFA analogue has no effect and a positively charged PUFA analogue induces positive V50 shifts. In contrast, we find that the KV7.4 channel is inhibited by PUFAs, which shift V50 towards more positive voltages. No effect on V50 of KV7.4 is observed by an uncharged or a positively charged PUFA analogue. Oocytes co-expressing KV7.4 and KV7.5 display an intermediate response to PUFAs. Altogether, the KV7.5 channels response to PUFAs is like that previously observed in KV7.1-7.3 channels, whereas the KV7.4 channel response is opposite, revealing subtype specific responses to PUFAs.",

While there are excellent methods to study neuronal activity in vivo, there are no nondestructive methods to measure global gene expression in living brains. Here we present a method, epigenetic magnetic resonance imaging (eMRI), that overcomes this limitation via direct imaging of DNA methylation, a major gene expression regulator. eMRI exploits the methionine metabolic pathways for DNA methylation to label genomic DNA through 13C-enriched diets. A novel 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging method then maps the spatial distribution of labeled DNA. We validated eMRI using pigs, whose brains have stronger similarity to humans in volume and anatomy than rodents, and confirmed efficient 13C labeling of brain DNA. We also discovered strong regional differences in global DNA methylation. Just as MRI measurements of regional neuronal activity have had a transformational effect on neuroscience, we expect that the eMRI signal as a surrogate for regional gene expression will enable many new investigations into the roles of gene expression in human brain function, behavior, and disease.",

RNA in situ hybridization showed that BdLCH1 is primarily expressed in chlorenchyma cells of mature leaves and internodes. Disruption of BdLCH1 resulted in an eight-fold increase in MLG content in senesced leaves. Consistent with the in situ hybridization data, immunolocalization results showed that MLG was not removed in chlorenchyma cells of lch1 mutants as it was in wild type and implicate the BdLCH1 enzyme in removing MLG in chlorenchyma cells in mature vegetative tissues. We also show that MLG accumulation in lch1 mutants was resistant to dark induced degradation, and eight-week-old lch1 plants showed a faster rate of starch breakdown than wild type in darkness. Our results suggest a role for BdLCH1 in modifying the cell wall to support highly metabolically active cells.",

Utilizing transcriptomics, proteomics and genome-wide chromatin accessibility assays, we unravel distinct molecular trajectories which govern the two processes. Notably, iMPC reprogramming is characterized by gradual upregulation of stem and progenitor cell markers, unique signaling pathways, chromatin remodelers and cell cycle regulators which manifest via rewiring of the chromatin in core myogenic promoters. Furthermore, we determine that only iMPC reprogramming is mediated by Notch pathway activation, which is indispensable for iMPC formation and self-renewal. Collectively, this study charts divergent molecular blueprints for myogenic transdifferentiation or reprogramming and underpins the heightened capacity of iMPCs in capturing myogenesis ex vivo.",

    "abstract": "The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been extensively characterized for many decades and is a critical resource for the study of numerous facets of eukaryotic biology. Recently, the analysis of whole genome sequencing data from over 1000 natural isolates of S. cerevisiae has provided critical insights into the evolutionary landscape of this species by revealing a population structure comprised of numerous genomically diverse lineages. These survey-level analyses have been largely devoid of structural genomic information, mainly because short read sequencing is not suitable for detailed characterization of genomic architecture. Consequently, we still lack a complete perspective of the genomic variation the exists within the species. Single molecule long read sequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore and PacBio, provide sequencing-based approaches with which to rigorously define the structure of a genome, and have empowered yeast geneticists to explore this poorly described realm of eukaryotic genomics. Here, we present the comprehensive genomic structural analysis of a pathogenic isolate of S. cerevisiae, YJM311. We used long read sequence analysis to construct a haplotype-phased, telomere-to-telomere length assembly of the YJM311 diploid genome and characterized the structural variations (SVs) therein. We discovered that the genome of YJM311 contains significant intragenomic structural variation, some of which imparts notable consequences to the genomic stability and developmental biology of the strain. Collectively, we outline a new methodology for creating accurate haplotype-phased genome assemblies and highlight how such genomic analyses can define the structural architectures of S. cerevisiae isolates. It is our hope that through continued structural characterization of S. cerevisiae genomes, such as we have reported here for YJM311, we will comprehensively advance our understanding of eukaryotic genome structure-function relationships, structural diversity, and evolution.",

Studies into the causal mechanisms of insecticide resistance are painting an increasingly complicated picture, underlining the need to design and implement targeted studies on this phenotype. In this study, we compare three populations of the major malaria vector An. coluzzii: a susceptible and two resistant colonies with the same genetic background. The original colonised resistant population rapidly lost resistance over a 6-month period, a subset of this population was reselected with pyrethroids a third population of this colony that did not lose resistance was also available. The original resistant, susceptible and re-selected colonies were subject to RNAseq and whole genome sequencing, which identified a number of changes across the transcriptome and genome linked with resistance. Firstly, an increase in the expression of genes within the oxidative phosphorylation pathway were seen in both resistant populations compared to the susceptible control; this translated phenotypically through an increased respiratory rate, indicating that elevated metabolism is linked directly with resistance. Genome sequencing highlighted several blocks clearly associated with resistance, including the 2Rb inversion. Finally, changes in the microbiome profile were seen, indicating that the microbial composition may play a role in the resistance phenotype. Taken together, this study reveals a highly complicated phenotype in which multiple transcriptomic, genomic and microbiome changes combine to result in insecticide resistance.",

    "abstract": "Gammaherpesviruses (GHVs) are lymphotropic tumor viruses with a biphasic infectious cycle. Lytic replication at the primary site of infection is necessary for GHVs to spread throughout the host and establish latency in distal sites. Dissemination is mediated by infected B cells that traffic hematogenously from draining lymph nodes to peripheral lymphoid organs, such as the spleen. B cells serve as the major reservoir for viral latency, and it is hypothesized that periodic reactivation from latently infected B cells contributes to maintaining long-term chronic infection. While fundamentally important to an understanding of GHV biology, aspects of B cell infection in latency establishment and maintenance are incompletely defined, especially roles for lytic replication and reactivation in this cell type. To address this knowledge gap and overcome limitations of replication-defective viruses, we generated a recombinant murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) in which ORF50, the gene that encodes the essential immediate-early replication and transcription activator protein (RTA), was flanked by loxP sites to enable conditional ablation of lytic replication by ORF50 deletion in cells that express Cre recombinase. Following infection of mice that encode Cre in B cells with this virus, splenomegaly and viral reactivation from splenocytes were significantly reduced, however the number of latently infected splenocytes was equivalent to WT MHV68. Despite ORF50 deletion, MHV68 latency was maintained over time in spleens of mice at levels approximating WT, reactivation-competent MHV68. Stimulation of polyclonal B cell activation and proliferation by treating mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which promotes MHV68 reactivation ex vivo, yielded equivalent increases in the number of latently infected cells for both ORF50-deleted and WT MHV68, even when mice were simultaneously treated with the antiviral drug cidofovir. Together, these data demonstrate that lytic replication in B cells is not required for MHV68 latency establishment and maintenance and further indicate that B cell proliferation, and not reactivation per se, is a major mechanism for maintaining latent viral genomes in the host.\n\nIMPORTANCEGammaherpesviruses establish lifelong chronic infections in cells of the immune system and place infected hosts at risk for developing lymphomas and other diseases. It is hypothesized that gammaherpesviruses must initiate acute infection in these cells to establish and maintain long-term infection, but this has not been directly tested. We report here the use of a viral genetic system that allows for cell-type-specific deletion of a viral gene that is essential for replication and reactivation. We employ this system in an in vivo model to reveal that viral replication is not required to initiate or maintain infection within immune cells.",

    "abstract": "Livestock represent a possible reservoir for facilitating the transmission of the zoonotic foodborne pathogen Salmonella enterica to humans; there is also concern that strains can acquire resistance to antimicrobials in the farm environment. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize Salmonella strains (n = 128) isolated from healthy dairy cattle and their associated environments on 13 New York State farms to assess the diversity and microevolution of this important pathogen at the level of the individual herd. Additionally, the accuracy and concordance of multiple in silico tools are assessed, including: (i) two in silico serotyping tools, (ii) combinations of five antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinant detection tools and one to five AMR determinant databases, and (iii) one antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) prediction tool. For the isolates sequenced here, in silico serotyping methods outperformed traditional serotyping and resolved all un-typable and/or ambiguous serotype assignments. Serotypes assigned in silico showed greater congruency with the Salmonella whole-genome phylogeny than traditional serotype assignments, and in silico methods showed high concordance (99% agreement). In silico AMR determinant detection methods additionally showed a high degree of concordance, regardless of the pipeline or database used ([&ge;]98% agreement between susceptible/resistant assignments for all pipeline/database combinations). For AMR detection methods that relied exclusively on nucleotide BLAST, accuracy could be maximized by using a range of minimum nucleotide identity and coverage thresholds, with thresholds of 75% nucleotide identity and 50-60% coverage adequate for most pipeline/database combinations. In silico characterization of the microevolution and AMR dynamics of each of six serotype groups (S. Anatum, Cerro, Kentucky, Meleagridis, Newport, Typhimurium/Typhimurium variant Copenhagen) revealed that some lineages were strongly associated with individual farms, while others were distributed across multiple farms. Numerous AMR determinant acquisition and loss events were identified, including the recent acquisition of cephalosporin resistance-conferring blaCMY- and blaCTX-M-type beta-lactamases. The results presented here provide high-resolution insight into the temporal dynamics of AMR Salmonella at the scale of the individual farm and highlight both the strengths and limitations of WGS in tracking zoonotic pathogens and their associated AMR determinants at the livestock-human interface.",

    "abstract": "SWEETs play important roles in intercellular sugar transport. Induction of SWEET sugar transporters by transcription activator-like effectors (TALe) of Xanthomonas ssp. is a key factor for bacterial leaf blight (BLB) infection of rice, cassava and cotton. Here, we identified the so far unknown OsSWEET11b with roles in male fertility and BLB susceptibility in rice. While single ossweet11a or b mutants were fertile, double mutants were sterile. Since clade III SWEETs can transport gibberellin (GA), a key hormone for rice spikelet fertility, sterility and BLB susceptibility might be explained by GA transport deficiencies. However, in contrast to the Arabidopsis homologs, OsSWEET11b did not mediate detectable GA transport. Fertility and susceptibility must therefore depend on SWEET11b-mediated sucrose transport. Ectopic induction of OsSWEET11b by designer TALe enables TALe-free Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) to cause disease, identifying OsSWEET11b as a BLB susceptibility gene and demonstrating that the induction of host sucrose uniporter activity is key to virulence of Xoo. Notably, only three of now six clade III SWEETs are targeted by known Xoo strains from Asia and Africa. The identification of OsSWEET11b has relevance in the context of fertility and for protecting rice against emerging Xoo strains that evolve TALes to exploit OsSWEET11b.",

Endogenous CRISPR systems in many bacteria and archaea are particularly attractive to circumvent expression, functionality, and unintended activity hurdles posed by heterologous CRISPR effectors. However, each CRISPR system recognizes a unique set of PAM sequences, which requires extensive screening of randomized DNA libraries. This challenge makes it difficult to develop endogenous CRISPR systems, especially in organisms that are slow-growing or have transformation idiosyncrasies. To address this limitation, we present Spacer2PAM, an easy-to-use, easy-to-interpret R package built to identify potential PAM sequences for any CRISPR system given its corresponding CRISPR array as input. Spacer2PAM can be used in \"Quick\" mode to generate a single PAM prediction that is likely to be functional or in \"Comprehensive\" mode to inform targeted, unpooled PAM libraries small enough to screen in difficult to transform organisms. We demonstrate Spacer2PAM by predicting PAM sequences for industrially relevant organisms and experimentally identifying seven PAM sequences that mediate interference from the Spacer2PAM-predicted PAM library for the type I-B CRISPR system from Clostridium autoethanogenum. We anticipate that Spacer2PAM will facilitate the use of endogenous CRISPR systems for industrial biotechnology and synthetic biology.",

Using a novel negative selection coupled with a high-throughput positive screen (Seamless Enrichment of Ligand-Inducible Sensors, SELIS), we evolve CamR biosensors that can recognize four distinct monoterpenes: borneol, fenchol, eucalyptol, and camphene. Different evolutionary trajectories surprisingly yielded common mutations, emphasizing the utility of CamR as a platform for creating generalist biosensors. Systematic promoter optimization driving the reporter increased the systems signal-to-noise ratio to 150-fold. These sensors can serve as a starting point for the high-throughput screening and dynamic regulation of bicyclic monoterpene production strains.",

While it is known that mutations at protein interfaces have a high potential to be damaging and cause human genetic disease, there has been relatively little consideration for how this varies between different types of interfaces. Here we investigate the properties of human pathogenic and putatively benign missense variants at homomeric (isologous and heterologous), heteromeric, DNA, RNA and other ligand interfaces, and at different regions with respect to those interfaces. We find that different types of interfaces vary greatly in their propensity to be associated with pathogenic mutations, with homomeric heterologous and DNA interfaces being particularly enriched in disease. We also find that residues that do not directly participate in an interface, but are close in 3D space, also show a significant disease enrichment. Finally, we show that mutations at different types of interfaces tend to have distinct property changes when undergoing amino acid substitutions associated with disease, and that this is linked to substantial variability in their identification by computational variant effect predictors.",

For a rational drug design and an understanding of mutational effects on protein function, structural data at atomic resolution are required.

Recently, the DeepMinds AlphaFold2 machine learning method greatly expanded the structural coverage of sequences, with high accuracy. Since the employed algorithm did not take specific properties of TM proteins into account, the validity of the generated TM structures should be assessed. Therefore, we investigated the quality of structures at genome scales, at the level of ABC protein superfamily folds, and also in specific individual cases. We tested template-free structure prediction also with a new TM fold, dimer modeling, and stability in molecular dynamics simulations. Our results strongly suggest that AlphaFold2 performs astoundingly well in the case of TM proteins and that its neural network is not overfitted. We conclude that a careful application of its structural models will advance TM protein associated studies at an unexpected level.",

Determining the impact of cancer-associated mutations on cellular phenotypes within these discrete contexts can provide new insight into how such mutations lead to dysregulated cell behaviors and subsequent cancer onset. Here we assess the impact of heritable BRCA2 mutation on embryonic development and the injury response using a zebrafish model (Danio rerio). Unlike most mouse models for BRCA2 mutation, brca2-mutant zebrafish are fully viable and thus provide a unique tool for assessing both embryonic and adult phenotypes. We find that maternally provided brca2 is critical for normal oocyte development and embryonic survival in zebrafish, suggesting that embryonic lethality associated with BRCA2 mutation is likely to reflect defects in both meiotic and embryonic developmental programs. On the other hand, we find that adult brca2-mutant zebrafish exhibit aberrant proliferation of several cell types under basal conditions and in response to injury in tissues at high risk for cancer development. These divergent effects exemplify the often-paradoxical outcomes that occur in embryos (embryonic lethality) versus adult animals (cancer predisposition) with mutations in cancer susceptibility genes such as BRCA2. The altered cell behaviors identified in brca2-mutant embryonic and adult tissues, particularly in adult tissues at high risk for cancer, indicate that the effects of BRCA2 mutation on cellular phenotypes are both context- and tissue-dependent.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus (HPC) and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) are two cortical areas of the primate brain deemed essential to cognition. Here we hypothesize that the codes mediating neuronal communication in HPC and LPFC microcircuits have distinctively evolved to serve plasticity and memory function at different spatiotemporal scales. We used a virtual reality task in which animals navigated through a maze using a joystick and selected one of two targets in the arms of the maze according to a learned context-color rule. We found that neurons and neuronal populations in both regions encode similar information about the task. Moreover, we demonstrate that many HPC neurons concentrate spikes into bursts, whereas most layer II/III LPFC neurons sparsely distribute spikes over time. As the animals learned the task HPC neurons, but not LPFC neurons, increased their burst rate as a function of performance. When integrating spike rates over short intervals, HPC neuronal ensembles reached maximum decoded information with fewer neurons than LPFC ensembles. Our results show that during associative learning HPC principal cells concentrate spikes in bursts enabling temporal summation and fast synaptic plasticity in small populations of neurons and ultimately facilitating rapid encoding of associative memories. On the other hand, layers II/III LPFC pyramidal cells fire spikes more sparsely distributed in time and over a larger number of neurons. The latter would facilitate broadcasting of signals loaded in short term memory across neuronal populations without necessarily triggering fast synaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Because of their crucial role in tumor immunity, NK cells have quickly become a prime target for immunotherapies, with adoptive transfer of NK cells and the use of NK cell engagers quickly moving to clinical stage. On the other hand, only few studies have focused on small molecule drugs capable of unleashing NK cell against cancer. In this context, repurposing small molecule is an attractive strategy to identify new immunotherapies from already approved drugs. Here, we screened 1,200 FDA-approved drugs from the Prestwick Chemical Library, to identify compounds that increase NK cell cytotoxic potential. Using a high-throughput luciferase-release cytotoxicity assay, we found that the antibiotic colistin sulfate increased cytotoxicity of human NK cells towards cancer cells. The effect of colistin was short lived and was not observed when NK cells were pretreated with the drug, showing how NK cell activity was potentiated only when the compound was present at the time of recognition of cancer cells. Further studies are needed to uncover the mechanism of action and the pre-clinical efficacy of colistin sulfate in mouse cancer models.",

    "abstract": "Currently approved anti-influenza drugs target viral proteins, are subtype limited, and are challenged by rising antiviral resistance. To overcome these limitations, we sought to identify a conserved essential RNA secondary structure within the genomic RNA predicted to have greater constraints on mutation in response to therapeutics targeting this structure. Here, we identified and genetically validated an RNA stemloop structure we termed PSL2, which serves as a packaging signal for genome segment PB2 and is highly conserved across influenza A virus (IAV) isolates. RNA structural modeling rationalized known packaging-defective mutations and allowed for predictive mutagenesis tests. Disrupting and compensating mutations of PSL2s structure give striking attenuation and restoration, respectively, of in vitro virus packaging and mortality in mice. Antisense Locked Nucleic Acid oligonucleotides (LNAs) designed against PSL2 dramatically inhibit IAV in vitro against viruses of different strains and subtypes, possess a high barrier to the development of antiviral resistance, and are equally effective against oseltamivir carboxylate-resistant virus. A single dose of LNA administered 3 days after, or 14 days before, a lethal IAV inoculum provides 100% survival. Moreover, such treatment led to the development of strong immunity to rechallenge with a ten-fold lethal inoculum. Together, these results have exciting implications for the development of a versatile novel class of antiviral therapeutics capable of prophylaxis, post-exposure treatment, and \"just-in-time\" universal vaccination against all IAV strains, including drug-resistant pandemics.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryTargeting a newly identified conserved RNA structure in the packaging signal region of influenza segment PB2 abrogates virus production in vitro and dramatically attenuates disease in vivo.",

Their impacts on the composition and metabolic function of the gut microbiome, however, vary greatly across individuals. Previous research showed that each individuals response to fibers depends on their baseline gut microbiome, but the ecology driving microbiota remodeling during fiber intake remained unclear. Here, we studied the long-term dynamics of gut microbiome and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in isogenic mice with distinct microbiota baselines fed with the fermentable fiber inulin compared to the non-fermentable fiber cellulose. We found that inulin produced generally rapid response followed by gradual stabilization to new equilibria, and those dynamics were baseline-dependent. We parameterized an ecology model from the timeseries data, which revealed a group of bacteria whose growth significantly increases in response to inulin. and whose baseline abundance and interspecies competition explains the baseline-dependence of microbiome density and community composition dynamics. Fecal levels of of SCFAs, such as propionate, is associated with the abundance of inulin responders, yet inter-individual variation of gut microbiome impedes the prediction of SCFAs by machine learning models. Finally, we showed that our methods and major findings are generalizable to dietary resistant starch. This study emphasizes the importance of ecological modeling to understand microbiome responses to dietary changes and the need for personalized interventions.",

Several medium size mammal belongs to the ungulate were known as the potential prey for the tiger. While, the information on the temporal availability of this prey in the rainforest is still limited. In here this study aimed to aims to model the niche partitioning of several mammalian species that was potential prey for tiger. The studied species were including barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), bearded pig (Sus barbatus), and wild boar (Sus scrofa). The method was using camera trap with data analyses including the calculation of Kernel density, diel activity, and niche partitioning determined using overlap index. . Based on the results, barking deer and wild boar showed only singular activity peak while bearded pig has several activity peaks. Only wild boar showed a strict diurnal activity pattern between 06:00 h and 12:00 h. Barking deer showed a crepuscular behavior with several activities observed at 18:00 h. While bearded pig showed a nocturnal behavior and showed at least two peaks of activity, one between 09:00 to 13:00 and another between 18:00 to 24:00 h. Barking deer and bearded pig uses almost similar niches since those species have the highest overlap indices value equals 0.504(95%CI:0.193-0.824). The lowest overlap indices value was observed for barking deer and wild boar with overlap indice values of 0.032(95%CI:0.0-0.162). Considering the diurnal activity pattern of the tiger that is mostly active at day, then the available preys were either barking deer or bearded pigs. While since barking deer and bearded pigs were using the same niche, then there will be potential competition.",

Our results describe a mixed mode of geographic divergence (isolation with secondary contact) resulting in a heterogeneous landscape of genomic divergence. Large contiguous \"continents of divergence\" encompass over one third of the genome (36%) and contain nearly all the fixed differences (94%) between the species, while the background genome has been homogenized. Chromosomal rearrangements between species, including inversions and intrachromosomal translocations, are associated with the continents of divergence and capture multiple adaptive alleles in genes and pathways thought to contribute to the species phenotypic differences.",

    "abstract": "New durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. Durum) cultivars with improved adaptation to variable rainfall environments are required to sustain productivity in the face of climate change. Physiological traits related to canopy development underpin the production of biomass and yield, as they interact with solar radiation and affect the timing of water use throughout the growing season. This study explored the temporal canopy dynamics of durum wheat using a nested-association mapping population evaluated for longitudinal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurements. Association mapping was performed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for time-point NDVI and spline-smoothed NDVI trajectory traits. Yield effects associated with QTL for canopy development were investigated using data from four rainfed field trials. Four QTL associated with slower canopy closure, improved yield in specific environments, and notably, were not associated with a yield penalty in any environment. This was likely due to optimised timing of water-use and pleiotropic effects on yield component traits, including spike number and spike length. Overall, this study suggests that slower canopy closure is beneficial for durum wheat production in rainfed environments. Selection for traits or loci associated with canopy development may improve yield stability of durum wheat in water limited environments.",

Active enhancer landscapes are known to determine cell states and behaviors. Super-enhancers, in particular, have helped reveal key disease drivers in several cancer types; however, they remain unexplored in human NASH. To define the enhancer signature of NASH-prone (NP) and NASH-resistant (NR) phenotypes in humans with obesity, we performed chromatin run-on sequencing (ChRO-seq) analysis on liver biopsies of individuals with obesity who were stratified into either NP or NR. We first demonstrated that NP and NR groups exhibit distinct active enhancer signatures. The subsequent identification of NP- and NR-specific super-enhancers revealed the specific genes that are likely the most critical for each of the phenotypes, including HES1 for NP and GATM for NR. Integrative analysis with results from genome-wide association studies of NAFLD and related traits identified disease/trait-loci specific to NP or NR enhancers. Further analysis of the ChRO-seq data pointed to critical roles for serine/glycine metabolism in NASH resistance, which was corroborate by profiling of circulating amino acids in the same patients. Overall, the distinct enhancer signatures of human NP and NR phenotypes revealed key genes, pathways, and transcription factor networks that promote NASH development.",

While multiple approaches have been developed to vascularize in vitro tissues, it has thus far not been possible to generate sufficiently dense networks of small-scale vessels to perfuse large de novo tissues. Here, we achieve the perfusion of multi-mm3 tissue constructs by generating networks of synthetic capillary-scale 3D vessels. Our 3D soft microfluidic strategy is uniquely enabled by a 3D-printable 2-photon-polymerizable hydrogel formulation, which allows for precise microvessel printing at scales below the diffusion limit of living tissues. We demonstrate that these large-scale engineered tissues are viable, proliferative and exhibit complex morphogenesis during long-term in-vitro culture, while avoiding hypoxia and necrosis. We show by scRNAseq and immunohistochemistry that neural differentiation is significantly accelerated in perfused neural constructs. Additionally, we illustrate the versatility of this platform by demonstrating long-term perfusion of developing liver tissue. This fully synthetic vascularization platform opens the door to the generation of human tissue models at unprecedented scale and complexity.",

    "abstract": "Cell shape is fundamental in biology. The average cell shape can influence crucial biological functions, such as cell fate and division orientation. But cell-to-cell shape variability is often regarded as noise. In contrast, recent works reveal that shape variability in diverse epithelial monolayers follows a nearly universal distribution. However, the origin and implications of this universality are unclear. Here, assuming contractility and adhesion are crucial for cell shape, characterized via aspect ratio (AR), we develop a mean-field analytical theory for shape variability. We find that a single parameter, , containing all the system-specific details, describes the probability distribution function (PDF) of AR; this leads to a universal relation between the standard deviation and the average of AR. The PDF for the scaled AR is not strictly but almost universal. The functional form is not related to jamming, contrary to common beliefs, but a consequence of a mathematical property. In addition, we obtain the scaled area distribution, described by the parameter {micro}. We show that  and {micro} together can distinguish the effects of changing physical conditions, such as maturation, on different system properties. The theory is verified in simulations of two distinct models of epithelial monolayers and agrees well with existing experiments. We demonstrate that in a confluent monolayer, average shape determines both the shape variability and dynamics. Our results imply the cell shape variability is inevitable, where a single parameter describes both statics and dynamics and provides a framework to analyze and compare diverse epithelial systems.",

We use NeuralDock and 25 GPUs to dock 937 million molecules from the ZINC database against superoxide dismutase-1 in 21 hours, which we validate with physical docking using MedusaDock. Due to its speed and accuracy, NeuralDock may be useful in brute-force virtual screening of massive chemical libraries and training of generative drug models.",

    "abstract": "The in vivo fate of nanoformulated drugs is governed by the physicochemical properties of the drug and the functionality of nanocarriers. Nanoformulations such as polymeric micelles, which physically encapsulate poorly soluble drugs, release their payload into the bloodstream during systemic circulation. This results in three distinct fractions of the drug-nanomedicine: encapsulated, protein-bound, and free drug. Having a thorough understanding of the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of each fraction is essential to elucidate mechanisms of nanomedicine-driven changes in drug exposure and PK/PD relationships pharmacodynamic activity. Here, we present a comprehensive preclinical assessment of the poly(2-oxazoline)-based polymeric micelle of paclitaxel (PTX) (POXOL hl-PM), including bioequivalence comparison to the clinically approved paclitaxel nanomedicine, Abraxane(R). Physicochemical characterization and toxicity analysis of POXOL hl-PM was conducted using standardized protocols by the Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory (NCL). The bioequivalence of POXOL hl-PM to Abraxane(R) was evaluated in rats and rhesus macaques using the NCLs established stable isotope tracer ultrafiltration assay (SITUA) to delineate the plasma PK of each PTX fraction. The SITUA study revealed that POXOL hl-PM and Abraxane(R) had comparable PK profiles not only for total PTX but also for the distinct drug fractions, suggesting bioequivalence in given animal models. The comprehensive preclinical evaluation of POXOL hl-PM in this study showcases a series of widely-applicable standardized studies by NCL for assessing nanoformulations prior to clinical investigation.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=72 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/457164v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a505a1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@149eccorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c5631eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ee6c68_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The physiological mechanisms of the responses toward stressors are the core of ecophysiology studies to understand the limits of an organisms flexibility and better predict the impact of environmental degradation on natural populations. However, little information is available when we question inter-individual variability of these physiological responses, even though they can be particularly important. Some observations of intersexual differences in heterothermy raised the question of a difference in energy management between sexes. Here we assess male and female differences in a mouse lemur model (Microcebus murinus), a highly seasonal Malagasy primate, studying their physiological flexibility toward caloric restriction, and examining the impact on their reproductive success. These animals are adapted for naturally changing food availability and climate conditions, and can express deep torpor, allowing them to spare their energy expenses over the dry and cold season. We monitored body mass and body temperature on 12 males and 12 females over winter, applying a chronic 40% caloric restriction to 6 individuals of each group. Our results showed variability of Tb modulations throughout winter and in response to caloric treatment depending on the sex, as females entered deep torpor regardless of food restriction, while only CR males had a similar response. The use of deep torpor, however, did not translate into better body condition either in females, or in response to CR, and did not clearly affect reproductive success. The favorable captive context potentially buffered the depth of torpor and minimized the positive effects of using torpor on energy savings. However, our results may emphasize the existence of other benefits of heterothermic responses than fat reserves.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCardiac dyskinesis in regional ischemia results in arrhythmias through mechanically-induced changes in electrophysiology ( mechano-arrhythmogenicity) that involve ischemic alterations in voltage-calcium (Ca2+) dynamics, creating a vulnerable period (VP) in late repolarisation.\n\nObjectiveTo determine cellular mechanisms of mechano-arrhythmogenicity in ischemia and define the importance of the VP.\n\nMethods and ResultsVoltage-Ca2+ dynamics were simultaneously monitored in rabbit ventricular myocytes by dual-fluorescence imaging to assess the VP in control and simulated ischemia (SI). The VP was longer in SI than in control (146{+/-}7 vs 54{+/-}8ms; p<0.0001) and was reduced by blocking KATP channels with glibenclamide (109{+/-}6ms; p<0.0001). Cells were rapidly stretched (10-18% increase in sarcomere length over 110-170ms) with carbon fibres during diastole or the VP. Mechano-arrhythmogenicity, associated with stretch and release in the VP, was greater in SI than control (7 vs 1% of stretches induced arrhythmias; p<0.005) but was similar in diastole. Arrhythmias during the VP were more complex than in diastole (100 vs 69% had sustained activity; p<0.05). In the VP, incidence was reduced with glibenclamide (2%; p<0.05), by chelating intracellular Ca2+ (BAPTA; 2%; p<0.05), blocking mechano-sensitive TRPA1 (HC-030031; 1%; p<0.005), or by scavenging (NAC; 1%; p<0.005) or blocking reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (DPI; 2%; p<0.05). Ratiometric Ca2+ imaging revealed that SI increased diastolic Ca2{+/-} (+9{+/-}1%, p<0.0001), which was not prevented by HC-030031 or NAC.\n\nConclusionIn ischemia, mechano-arrhythmogenicity is enhanced specifically during the VP and is mediated by ROS, TRPA1, and Ca2+.",

    "abstract": "Tau becomes abnormally hyper-phosphorylated and aggregated in tauopathies like Alzheimers disease (AD). As age is the greatest risk factor for developing AD, it is important to understand how tau protein itself, and the pathways implicated in its turnover, change during aging. We investigated age-related changes in total and phosphorylated tau in brain samples from two cohorts of cognitively normal individuals spanning 19-74 years, without overt neurodegeneration. One cohort utilised resected tissue and the other used post-mortem tissue. Total soluble tau levels declined with age in both cohorts. Phosphorylated tau was undetectable in the post-mortem tissue but was clearly evident in the resected tissue and did not undergo significant age-related change. To ascertain if the decline in soluble tau was correlated with age-related changes in autophagy, three markers of autophagy were tested but only two appeared to increase with age and the third was unchanged. This implies that in individuals who do not develop neurodegeneration, there is an age-related reduction in soluble tau which could potentially be due to age-related changes in autophagy. Thus, to explore how an age-related increase in autophagy might influence tau-mediated dysfunctions in vivo, autophagy was enhanced in a Drosophila model and all age-related tau phenotypes were significantly ameliorated. These data shed light on age-related physiological changes in proteins implicated in AD and highlights the need to study pathways that may be responsible for these changes. It also demonstrates the therapeutic potential of interventions that upregulate turnover of aggregate-prone proteins during aging.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive capacity of many organisms is seriously challenged by human-imposed environmental change, which currently happens at unprecedented rates and magnitudes. For migratory fish, habitat fragmentation is a major challenge that can compromise their survival and reproduction. Therefore, it is important to study if fish populations can adapt to such modifications of their habitat. Here, we study whether originally anadromous three-spined stickleback populations (Gasterosteus aculeatus;  migrants) changed in behavior and morphology in response to human-induced isolation. We made use of a natural field-experiment, where the construction of pumping stations and sluices in the 1970s unintendedly created replicates of land-locked stickleback populations ( resident) in the Netherlands. For two years, we systematically tested populations of residents and migrants for differences in morphology and behavioral traits (activity, aggressiveness, exploration, boldness and shoaling) in lab-based assays. We detected differences between migrant and resident populations in virtually all phenotypic traits studied: compared to the ancestral migrants, residents were smaller in size, had fewer and smaller plates and were significantly more active, aggressive, exploratory and bolder and shoaled less. Despite large ecological differences between 2018 and 2019, results were largely consistent across the two years. Our study shows that human-induced environmental change has led to the rapid and consistent morphological and behavioral divergence of stickleback populations in about 50 generations. Such changes may be adaptive but this remains to be tested.\n\nLay summaryThe adaptive capacity of many organisms is seriously challenged by human-imposed environmental changes. For example, migratory fish encounter man-made barriers that impede their movements and force them to adopt a resident lifecycle. Here we study whether and how populations of three-spined sticklebacks diverged in response to human-induced isolation. We show that about 50 generations of isolation were sufficient to induce substantial morphological and behavioral differentiation between land-locked populations ( residents) and their migratory ancestors ( migrants).",

    "abstract": "The inability to simultaneously observe all of the important Rho GTPases (Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA) has prevented us from obtaining evidence of their coordinated regulation during cell deformation. Here, we propose Motion-Triggered Average (MTA), an algorithm that converts individually observed GTPases into pseudo-simultaneous observations. Using the time series obtained by MTA and mathematical model, we succeeded for the first time in decoding the cell edge velocity from the three GTPase activities to provide clear numerical evidence for coordinated cell edge regulation by the three GTPases. We found that the characteristics of the obtained activities were consistent with those of previous studies, and that GTPase activities and their derivatives were involved in edge regulation. Our approach provides an effective strategy for using single-molecule observations to elucidate problems hampered by the lack of simultaneous observations.",
