    "abstract": "Neoantigen discovery in pediatric brain tumors is hampered by their low mutational burden and scant tissue availability. We developed a low-input proteogenomic approach combining tumor DNA/RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry proteomics to identify tumor-restricted (neoantigen) peptides arising from multiple genomic aberrations to generate a highly target-specific, autologous, personalized T cell immunotherapy. Our data indicate that novel splice junctions are the primary source of neoantigens in medulloblastoma, a common pediatric brain tumor. Proteogenomically identified tumor-specific peptides are immunogenic and generate MHC II-based T cell responses. Moreover, polyclonal and polyfunctional T cells specific for tumor-specific peptides effectively eliminated tumor cells in vitro. Targeting novel tumor-specific antigens obviates the issue of central immune tolerance while potentially providing a safety margin favoring combination with other immune-activating therapies. These findings demonstrate the proteogenomic discovery of immunogenic tumor-specific peptides and lay the groundwork for personalized targeted T cell therapies for children with brain tumors.",

    "abstract": "Transmembrane and Coiled-Coil 2 (TMCC2) is a protein that forms complexes with both apolipoprotein E (apoE) and the amyloid protein precursor (APP), two proteins central to the etiology of Alzheimers disease (AD). Here we have carried out the first investigation of TMCC2 expression in the human brain, where TMCC2 immunoreactivity is primarily neuronal. We also examined TMCC2 localization in late onset AD brains,early onset AD cases bearing a mutation in APP, and in Down syndrome cases. TMCC2 immunoreactivity is closely associated with APP immunoreactivity in both control and AD cases. In all AD cases examined, TMCC2 associated with dense core senile plaques and adjacent dystrophic neurites, but not with amyloid surrounding the core, nor with diffuse amyloid plaques or neurofibrillary tangles. In Down syndrome, we found dystrophic neurites in senile plaques that were positive for amyloid and TMCC2, but not for APP, in addition to the APP- and TMCC2-positive dense cores. Western blot analysis revealed TMCC2 exists as at least three protein isoforms. The relative abundance of the isoforms varies in the temporal gyrus and cerebellum, the relative proportions of which were influenced by APOE and/or dementia status.\n\nTaken together, these observations are consistent with the evolutionarily conserved interactions between APP and TMCC2 and suggest cooperation betweenTMCC2 and APP in the normal and AD brain. These findings thus support a role for TMCC2 as a mediator of the impact of apoE on AD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus causes a range of human and animal diseases collectively known as aspergillosis. A. fumigatus possesses and expresses a range of genetic determinants of virulence, which facilitate colonisation and disease progression, including the secretion of mycotoxins. Gliotoxin (GT) is the best studied A. fumigatus mycotoxin with a wide range of known toxic effects that impair human immune cell function. GT is also highly toxic to A. fumigatus and this fungus has evolved self-protection mechanisms that include (i) the GT efflux pump GliA, (ii) the GT neutralising enzyme GliT, and (iii) the negative regulation of GT biosynthesis by the bis-thiomethyltransferase GtmA. The transcription factor (TF) RglT is the main regulator of GliT and this GT protection mechanism also occurs in the non-GT producing fungus A. nidulans. However, the A. nidulans genome does not encode GtmA and GliA. This work aimed at analysing the transcriptional response to exogenous GT in A. fumigatus and A. nidulans, two distantly related Aspergillus species, and to identify additional components required for GT protection. RNA-sequencing shows a highly different transcriptional response to exogenous GT with the RglT-dependent regulon also significantly differing between A. fumigatus and A. nidulans. However, we were able to observe homologs whose expression pattern was similar in both species (43 RglT-independent and 11 RglT-dependent). Based on this approach, we identified a novel RglT-dependent methyltranferase, MtrA, involved in GT protection. Taking into consideration the occurrence of RglT-independent modulated genes, we screened an A. fumigatus deletion library of 484 transcription factors (TFs) for sensitivity to GT and identified 15 TFs important for GT self-protection. Of these, the TF KojR, which is essential for kojic acid biosynthesis in Aspergillus oryzae, was also essential for virulence and GT biosynthesis in A. fumigatus, and for GT protection in A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, and A. oryzae. KojR regulates rglT, gliT, gliJ expression and sulfur metabolism in Aspergillus species. Together, this study identified conserved components required for GT protection in Aspergillus species.\n\nAuthor SummaryA. fumigatus secretes mycotoxins that are essential for its virulence and pathogenicity. Gliotoxin (GT) is a sulfur-containing mycotoxin, which is known to impair several aspects of the human immune response. GT is also toxic to different fungal species, which have evolved several GT protection strategies. To further decipher these responses, we used transcriptional profiling aiming to compare the response to GT in the GT producer A. fumigatus and the GT non-producer A. nidulans. This analysis allowed us to identify additional genes with a potential role in GT protection. We also identified 15 transcription factors (TFs) encoded in the A. fumigatus genome that are important for conferring resistance to exogenous gliotoxin. One of these TFs, KojR, which is essential for A. oryzae kojic acid production, is also important for virulence and GT protection in A. fumigatus, A. nidulans and A. oryzae. KojR regulates the expression of another TF, an oxidoreductase, previously shown to be essential for GT protection, and sulfur metabolism. Together, this work identified conserved components required for gliotoxin protection in Aspergillus species.",

    "abstract": "Development of tooth cusps is regulated by the enamel knot signalling centre. Fgf signalling regulates differential proliferation between the enamel knot and adjacent dental epithelia during tooth development, leading to formation of the dental cusp. The presence of an enamel knot in non-mammalian vertebrates is debated given differences in signalling. Here we show the conservation and restriction of fgf10 and fgf3 to the sites of future dental cusps in the shark (Scyliorhinus canicula), whilst also highlighting striking differences between the shark and mouse. We reveal shifts in tooth size, shape and cusp number following small molecule perturbations of canonical Wnt signalling. Resulting tooth phenotypes mirror observed effects in mammals, where canonical Wnt has been implicated as an upstream regulator of enamel knot signalling. In silico modelling of shark dental morphogenesis demonstrates how subtle changes in activatory and inhibitory signals can alter tooth shape, resembling phenotypes observed following experimental Wnt perturbation. Our results support the functional conservation of an enamel knot-like signalling centre throughout vertebrates and suggest that varied tooth types from sharks to mammals follow a similar developmental bauplan. Lineage-specific differences in signalling are not sufficient in refuting homology of this signalling centre, which is likely older than teeth themselves.",

    "abstract": "The effective population size (Ne) is a key parameter to quantify the magnitude of genetic drift and inbreeding, with important implications in human evolution. The increasing availability of high-density genetic markers allows the estimation of historical changes in Ne across time using measures of genome diversity or linkage disequilibrium between markers. Selection is expected to reduce diversity and Ne, and this reduction is modulated by the heterogeneity of the genome in terms of recombination rate. Here we investigate by computer simulations the consequences of selection (both positive and negative) and of recombination rate heterogeneity in the estimation of historical Ne. We also investigate the relationship between diversity parameters and Ne across the different regions of the genome using human marker data. We show that the estimates of historical Ne obtained from linkage disequilibrium between markers (NeLD) are virtually unaffected by selection. In contrast, those estimates obtained by coalescence mutation-recombination-based methods can be strongly affected by it, what could have important consequences for the estimation of human demography. The simulation results are supported by the analysis of human data. The estimates of NeLD obtained for particular genomic regions do not correlate with recombination rate, nucleotide diversity, polymorphism, background selection statistic, minor allele frequency of SNPs, loss of function and missense variants and gene density. This suggests that NeLD measures are merely indicative of demographic changes in population size across generations.\n\nAuthor summaryThe inference of the demographic history of populations is of great relevance in evolutionary biology. This inference can be made from genomic data using coalescence methods or linkage disequilibrium methods. However, the assessment of these methods is usually made assuming neutrality (absence of selection). Here we show by computer simulations and analyses of human data that the estimates of historical effective population size obtained from linkage disequilibrium between markers are unaffected by natural selection, either positive or negative. In contrast, estimates obtained by coalescence mutation-recombination-based methods can be strongly affected by it, which could have important consequences for recent estimations of human demography. Thus, only linkage disequilibrium methods appear to provide unbiased estimates of the population census size.",

    "abstract": "Age-related change in human haematopoiesis causes reduced regenerative capacity1, cytopenias2, immune dysfunction3 and increased risk of blood cancer. The cellular alterations that underpin the abruptness of this functional decline after the age of 70 years remain elusive. We sequenced 3579 genomes from single-cell-derived colonies of haematopoietic stem cell/multipotent progenitors (HSC/MPPs) across 10 haematologically normal subjects aged 0-81 years. HSC/MPPs accumulated 17 mutations/year after birth and lost 30bp/year of telomere length. Haematopoiesis in adults aged <65 was massively polyclonal, with high indices of clonal diversity and a stable population of 20,000-200,000 HSC/MPPs contributing evenly to blood production. In contrast, haematopoiesis in individuals aged >75 showed profoundly decreased clonal diversity. In each elderly subject, 30-60% of haematopoiesis was accounted for by 12-18 independent clones, each contributing 1-34% of blood production. Most clones had begun their expansion before age 40, but only 22% had known driver mutations. Genome-wide selection analysis estimated that 1/34 to 1/12 non-synonymous mutations were drivers, occurring at a constant rate throughout life, affecting a wider pool of genes than identified in blood cancers. Loss of Y chromosome conferred selective benefits on HSC/MPPs in males. Simulations from a simple model of haematopoiesis, with constant HSC population size and constant acquisition of driver mutations conferring moderate fitness benefits, entirely explained the abrupt change in clonal structure in the elderly. Rapidly decreasing clonal diversity is a universal feature of haematopoiesis in aged humans, underpinned by pervasive positive selection acting on many more genes than currently identified.",

    "abstract": "Y chromosomes across diverse species convergently evolve a gene-poor, heterochromatic organization enriched for duplicated genes, LTR retrotransposable elements, and satellite DNA. Sexual antagonism and a loss of recombination play major roles in the degeneration of young Y chromosomes. However, the processes shaping the evolution of mature, already degenerated Y chromosomes are less well-understood. Because Y chromosomes evolve rapidly, comparisons between closely related species are particularly useful. We generated de novo long read assemblies complemented with cytological validation to reveal Y chromosome organization in three closely related species of the Drosophila simulans complex, which diverged only 250,000 years ago and share >98% sequence identity. We find these Y chromosomes are divergent in their organization and repetitive DNA composition and discover new Y-linked gene families whose evolution is driven by both positive selection and gene conversion. These Y chromosomes are also enriched for large deletions, suggesting that the repair of double-strand breaks on Y chromosomes may be biased toward microhomology-mediated end joining over canonical non-homologous end-joining. We propose that this repair mechanism generally contributes to the convergent evolution of Y chromosome organization.",

Here, we analyzed structural and functional brain network development in an accelerated longitudinal cohort spanning 14-25 years (n = 199). Core to our work was an advanced in vivo model of cortical wiring incorporating MRI features of cortico-cortical proximity, microstructural similarity, and white matter tractography. Longitudinal analyses assessing age-related changes in cortical wiring identified a continued differentiation of multiple cortico-cortical structural networks in youth. Studying resting-state functional MRI measures in the same participants at baseline, we found that regions with more similar structural wiring were more likely to be functionally coupled. Moreover, longitudinal structural wiring changes, particularly between sensory/unimodal and default mode networks, were reflected in tendencies for increased differentiation in brain function. These longitudinal findings provide new insights into adolescent development of human brain structure and function, illustrating how structural wiring interacts with the maturation of macroscale functional hierarchies.",

    "abstract": "Humans are exposed to numerous synthetic foreign particulates in the form of environmental pollutants and diagnostic or therapeutic agents. Specialized immune cells (phagocytes) clear these particulates by phagocytosing and attempting to degrade them. The process of recognition and internalization of the particulates may trigger changes in the function of phagocytes. Some of these changes, especially the ability of a particle-loaded phagocyte to take up and neutralize pathogens, remains poorly studied. Herein, we demonstrate that the uptake of non-stimulatory cargo-free particles enhances the phagocytic ability of monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. The enhancement in phagocytic ability was independent of particle properties, such as size or the base material constituting the particle. Additionally, we show that the increased phagocytosis was not a result of cellular activation or cellular heterogeneity but was driven by changes in cell membrane fluidity and cellular compliance. A consequence of the enhanced phagocytic activity was that particulate-laden immune cells neutralize E. coli faster in culture. Moreover, when administered in mice as a prophylactic, particulates enable faster clearance of E. coli and S. epidermidis. Together, we demonstrate that the process of uptake induces cellular changes that favor additional phagocytic events. This study provides insights into using non-stimulatory cargo-free particles to engineer immune cell functions for applications involving faster clearance of phagocytosable particulates.",
