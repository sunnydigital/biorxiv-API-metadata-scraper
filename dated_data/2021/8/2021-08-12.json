    "abstract": "The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a small, subcortical brain structure. It is a target for deep brain stimulation, an invasive treatment that reduces motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease. Side effects of DBS are commonly explained using the tripartite model of STN organization, which proposes three functionally distinct subregions in the STN specialized in cognitive, limbic, and motor processing. However, evidence for the tripartite model exclusively comes from anatomical studies and functional studies using clinical patients. Here, we provide the first experimental tests of the tripartite model in healthy volunteers using ultra-high field 7 Tesla (T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 34 participants performed a random-dot motion decision-making task with a difficulty manipulation and a choice payoff manipulation aimed to differentially affect cognitive and limbic networks. Moreover, participants responded with their left and right index finger, differentially affecting motor networks. We analysed BOLD signal in three subregions of equal volume of the STN along the dorsolateral-ventromedial axis, identified using manually delineated high resolution anatomical images. Our results indicate that all segments responded equally to the experimental manipulations, and did not support the tripartite model.",

    "abstract": "To understand the nature of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, we analyzed at single cell level the B cell responses of five naive and five convalescent people immunized with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Convalescents had higher frequency of spike protein specific memory B cells and by cell sorting delivered 3,532 B cells, compared with 2,352 from naive people. Of these, 944 from naive and 2,299 from convalescents produced monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein and 411 of them neutralized the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 virus. More than 75% of the monoclonal antibodies from naive people lost their neutralization activity against the B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.1.248 (gamma) variants while this happened only for 61% of those from convalescents. The overall loss of neutralization was lower for the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants, however it was always significantly higher in those of naive people. In part this was due to the IGHV2-5;IGHJ4-1 germline, which was found only in convalescents and generated potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies. Overall, vaccination of seropositive people increases the frequency of B cells encoding antibodies with high potency and that are not susceptible to escape by any of the four variants of concern. Our data suggest that people that are seropositive following infection or primary vaccination will produce antibodies with increased potency and breadth and will be able to better control SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants.",

    "abstract": "The endosome-lysosome (endolysosome) system plays central roles in both autophagic degradation and secretory pathways, including the exocytic release of extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs). Although previous work has revealed important interconnections between autophagy and EVP-mediated secretion, our molecular understanding of these secretory events during endolysosome inhibition remains incomplete. Here, we delineate a secretory autophagy pathway upregulated in response to endolysosomal inhibition that mediates the EVP-associated extracellular release of autophagic cargo receptors, including p62/SQSTM1. This extracellular secretion is highly regulated and critically dependent on multiple ATGs required for the progressive steps of early autophagosome formation as well as Rab27a-dependent exocytosis. Furthermore, the disruption of autophagosome maturation, either due to genetic inhibition of the autophagosome-to-autolyosome fusion machinery or blockade via the SARS-CoV2 viral protein ORF3a, is sufficient to induce robust EVP-associated secretion of autophagy cargo receptors. Finally, we demonstrate that this ATG-dependent, EVP-mediated secretion pathway buffers against the intracellular accumulation of autophagy cargo receptors when classical autophagic degradation is impaired. Based on these results, we propose that secretory autophagy via EVPs functions as an alternate route to clear sequestered material and maintain proteostasis in response to endolysosomal dysfunction or impaired autophagosome maturation.",

    "abstract": "Fisheries managers routinely use hatcheries to increase angling opportunity. Many hatcheries operate as segregated programs where hatchery-origin fish are not intended to spawn with natural-origin conspecifics in order to prevent potential negative effects on the natural-origin population. Currently available techniques to monitor the frequency with which hatchery-origin strays successfully spawn in the wild rely on either genetic differentiation between the hatchery- and natural-origin fish or extensive sampling of fish on the spawning grounds. We present a method to infer grandparent-grandchild trios using only genotypes from two putative grandparents and one putative grandchild. We developed estimators of false positive and false negative error rates and showed that genetic panels containing 500 - 700 single nucleotide polymorphisms or 200 - 300 microhaplotypes are expected to allow application of this technique for monitoring segregated hatchery programs. We discuss the ease with which this technique can be implemented by pre-existing parentage-based tagging programs and provide an R package that applies the method.",

    "abstract": "Several species of the soil borne fungus of the genus Trichoderma are known to be versatile, opportunistic plant symbionts, and are the most successful biocontrol agents used in todays agriculture. To be successful in the field conditions, the fungus must endure varying climatic conditions. Studies have indicated that high atmospheric temperature coupled with low humidity is a major limitation for the inconsistent performance of Trichoderma under field conditions. Understanding the molecular modulation associated with such Trichoderma that persist and deliver under abiotic stress condition will aid in exploiting the worth of these organisms for such use. In this study, comparative proteomic analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF-TOF) mass spectrometry was used to identify proteins associated with thermotolerance in two thermotolerant isolates of Trichoderma--T. longibrachiatum 673, TaDOR673 and T. asperellum 7316, TaDOR7316--and 32 differentially expressed proteins were identified. Sequence homology and conserved domains were used to identify these proteins and to assign probable function to them. Thermotolerant isolate, TaDOR673, seemed to employ the stress signaling MAPK pathways and heat shock response pathways to combat the stress condition whereas the moderately tolerant isolate, TaDOR7316, seemed to adapt to high temperature conditions by reducing the accumulation of mis-folded proteins through unfolded protein response pathway and autophagy. Also, there were unique as well as common proteins that were differentially expressed in the two isolates studied.",

    "abstract": "Genetic compensation through transcriptional adaptation has been proposed to explain phenotypic differences between gene knockouts and knockdowns. With the rapid development of reverse genetic tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 and RNAi in microalgae, it is increasingly important to assess whether genetic compensation affects the phenotype of engineered algal mutants. While exploring triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis pathways in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, it was discovered that knockout of certain genes catalyzing rate-limiting steps of TAG biosynthesis, type-2 diacylglycerol acyltransferase genes (DGTTs), triggered genetic compensation under abiotic stress conditions. Genetic compensation of a DGTT1 null mutation by a related PDAT gene was observed regardless of the strain background or mutagenesis approach, e.g., CRISPR/Cas 9 or insertional mutagenesis. However, no compensation was found in the PDAT knockout mutant. The effect of PDAT knockout was evaluated in a {Delta}vtc1 mutant, in which PDAT was up-regulated under stress. Knockout of PDAT in the {Delta}vtc1 background induced a 12.8-fold upregulation of DGTT1 and a 272.3% increase in TAG content in {Delta}vtc1/pdat1 cells, while remaining viable. These data suggest that genetic compensation contributes to the genetic robustness of microalgal TAG biosynthetic pathways, maintaining lipid and redox homeostasis in the knockout mutants under abiotic stress with a mechanism distinct from that found in plants. This work demonstrates examples of genetic compensation in microalgae, implies the physiological relevance of genetic compensation in TAG biosynthesis, and provides guidance for future genetic engineering and mutant characterization efforts.",

We set out to reconstitute the pathway for strictosidine, a key intermediate of all MIAs, from central metabolism in Nicotiana benthamiana. A disadvantage of this host is that its rich background metabolism results in the derivatization of some heterologously produced molecules. We used transcriptomic analysis to identify glycosyltransferases that were upregulated in response to biosynthetic intermediates and produced plant lines with targeted mutations in the genes encoding them. Expression of the early MIA pathway in these lines produced a more favorable product profile. Strictosidine biosynthesis was successfully reconstituted, with the best yields obtained by the co-expression of 14 enzymes, of which a major latex protein-like enzyme (MLPL) from Nepeta (catmint) was critical for improving flux through the iridoid pathway. The removal of endogenous glycosyltransferases did not impact the yields of strictosidine, highlighting that the metabolic flux of the pathway enzymes to a stable biosynthetic intermediate minimizes the need to engineer the endogenous metabolism of the host. The production of strictosidine in planta expands the range of MIA products amenable to biological synthesis.",

    "abstract": "The porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) is responsible for significant economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza virus are major viral contributors to PRDC. Vaccines are cost-effective measures for controlling PRRS, however, their efficacy in the context of co-infections has been poorly investigated. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of PRRSV-2 and swine influenza H3N2 virus co-infection on the efficacy of PRRSV modified live virus (MLV) vaccination, which is widely used in the field. Following simultaneous challenge with contemporary PRRSV-2 and H3N2 field isolates, we found that the protective effect of PRRS MLV vaccination on clinical disease and pathology was abrogated, although viral load was unaffected and antibody responses were enhanced. In contrast, co-infection in non-immunized animals reduced PRRSV-2 viremia and H3N2 virus load in the upper respiratory tract and potentiated T cell responses against both PRRSV-2 and H3N2 in the lung. Further analysis suggested that an upregulation of inhibitory cytokines gene expression in the lungs of vaccinated pigs may have influenced responses to H3N2 and PRRSV-2. These findings provide important insights into the effect of viral co-infections on PRRS vaccine efficacy that may help identity more effective vaccination strategies against PRDC in the field.",

To address this question, we performed tandem affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry and identified proteins that physically interact with the Paramecium Enhancer-of-zeste Ezl1 enzyme, which catalyzes H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 deposition at TEs. We show that the Paramecium PRC2 core complex comprises four subunits, each required in vivo for catalytic activity. We also identify PRC2 cofactors, including the RNA interference (RNAi) effector Ptiwi09, which are necessary to target H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 to TEs. We find that the physical interaction between PRC2 and the RNAi pathway is mediated by a RING finger protein and that small RNA recruitment of PRC2 to TEs is analogous to the small RNA recruitment of H3K9 methylation SU(VAR)3-9 enzymes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe healing environment within the posterolateral lumbar spine is one of the most clinically challenging bone healing environments in all of orthopaedics due to a lack of a contained space and the need to form de novo bone in a non-bony environment. Our group has previously published data that suggests that sclerostin in expressed locally at high levels throughout the process of a spinal fusion mass maturing.\n\nMethodsWe computationally identified multiple FDA-approved drugs, as well as a novel drug, for their ability to disrupt the interaction between sclerostin and its receptor, LRP5/6. The drugs were tested in several in vitro biochemical assays using murine MC3T3 and MSCs, assessing their ability to (1) enhance canonical Wnt signaling, (2) promote the accumulation of the active (non-phosphorylated) form of {beta}-catenin, and (3) enhance the intensity and signaling duration of BMP signaling. These drugs were then tested subcutaneously in rats as standalone osteoinductive agents on plain collagen sponges. Finally, the top drug candidates (called VA1 and C07) were tested in a rabbit posterolateral spine fusion model for their ability to achieve a successful fusion.\n\nResultsWe show that by controlling GSK3b phosphorylation, these SMIs simultaneously enhance canonical Wnt signaling and potentiate canonical BMP signaling intensity and duration. We also demonstrate that the SMIs produce dose-dependent ectopic mineralization in vivo in rats as well as significantly increase posterolateral spine fusion rates in rabbits in vivo, both as standalone osteogenic drugs and in combination with autologous iliac crest bone graft.\n\nConclusionsFew if any osteogenic small molecules have been described that possess the osteoinductive potency of BMP itself - that is, the ability to form de novo ectopic bone as a standalone agent, particularly in stringent in vivo environments. Herein, we describe two such SMIs that have this unique ability and thus may have potential application as novel cost-effective biologic bone graft substitutes for achieving consistent spinal fusion or even or critical-sized fracture defects.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by a Veteran Affairs Career Development Award (IK2-BX003845).",

    "abstract": "Embryogenesis, tissue repair and cancer metastasis rely on collective cell migration (CCM). In vitro studies propose that migrating cells are stiffer when exposed to stiff substrates, known to allow CCM, but softer when plated in compliant non-permissive surfaces. Here, by combining in vivo atomic force microscopy (iAFM) and modelling we reveal that to collectively migrate in vivo, cells require to dynamically decrease their stiffness in response to the temporal stiffening of their native substrate. Moreover, molecular and mechanical perturbations of embryonic tissues uncover that this unexpected cell mechanical response is achieved by a new mechanosensitive pathway involving Piezo1-mediated microtubule deacetylation. Finally, lowering microtubule acetylation and consequently cell stiffness was sufficient to allow CCM in soft non-permissive substrates, suggesting that a fixed value of substrate stiffness is not as essential for CCM as it is reaching an optimal cell-to-substrate stiffness value.

    "abstract": "One of the most robust and reproducible methods to prolong lifespan in a variety of organisms is inhibition of the mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) pathway. mTORC1 is a metabolic sensor that promotes anabolic growth when nutrients are abundant. Inhibition of mTORC1 extends lifespan, but also frequently has other effects such as stunted growth, slowed development, reduced fertility, and disrupted metabolism. It has long been assumed that suppression of anabolism and resulting phenotypes such as impaired growth and reproduction may be causal to mTORC1 longevity, but this hypothesis has not been directly tested. RAGA-1 is an upstream activator of TORC1. Previous work from our lab using a C. elegans model of mTORC1 longevity, the long-lived raga-1 null mutant, found that the presence of raga-1 only in the neurons suppresses longevity of the null mutant. Here, we use the auxin-inducible degradation (AID) system to test whether neuronal mTORC1 inhibition is sufficient for longevity, and whether any changes in lifespan are also linked to stunted growth or fertility. We find that life-long AID of RAGA-1 either in all somatic tissue or only in the neurons of C. elegans is sufficient to extend lifespan. We also find that AID of RAGA-1 or LET-363/mTOR beginning at day 1 of adulthood extends lifespan to a similar extent. Unlike somatic degradation of RAGA-1, neuronal degradation of RAGA-1 doesnt impair growth, slow development, or decrease the reproductive capacity of the worms. Lastly, while AID of LET-363/mTOR in all somatic cells shortens lifespan, neuronal AID of LET-363/mTOR slows aging. This work demonstrates that targeting mTORC1 specifically in the neurons uncouples longevity from growth and reproductive impairments, challenging previously held ideas about the mechanisms of mTORC1 longevity and elucidating the promise of tissue-specific aging therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modification by the small ubiquitin-like modifier, SUMO can modulate the activity of its conjugated proteins. The transcriptional regulator Jun, a member of the AP-1, complex is one such SUMO target. We find that Jra, the Drosophila Jun ortholog, is a regulator of the Pseudomonas entomophila induced gut immune gene regulatory network, modulating the expression of a few thousand genes, as measured by quantitative RNA sequencing. Decrease in Jra in gut enterocytes is protective, suggesting that reduction of Jra signaling favors the host over the pathogen. In Jra, lysines 29 and 190 are SUMO conjugation targets, with the JraK29R+K190R double mutant being SUMO conjugation resistant (SCR). Interestingly, a JraSCR fly line, generated by CRISPR/Cas9 based genome editing, is more sensitive to infection, with adults showing a weakened host response and increased proliferation of Pseudomonas. Transcriptome analysis of the guts of JraSCR and JraWT flies suggests that lack of SUMOylation of Jra significantly changes core elements of the immune gene regulatory network, that include antimicrobial agents, secreted ligands, feedback regulators, and transcription factors. SUMOylation attenuates Jra activity, with the master immune regulator Relish being an important transcriptional target. Our study implicates Jra as a major immune regulator, with dynamic SUMO conjugation/deconjugation modulating the kinetics of the gut transcriptional immune response.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome folding links genome structure with gene function by generating distinct nuclear compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs). In mammals, these undergo preferential interactions and regulate gene expression. However, their role in fungal genome biology is unclear. Here, we combine Nanopore (ONT) sequencing with chromatin conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C) to reveal chromosome and epigenetic diversity in a group of obligate plant symbionts; the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We find that five phylogenetically distinct strains of the model AMF Rhizophagus irregularis carry 33 chromosomes with substantial within species variability in size, as well as in gene and repeat content. Strain-specific Hi-C contact maps all reveal a  checkerboard pattern that underline two dominant euchromatin (A) and heterochromatin (B) compartments. Each compartment differs in the level of gene transcription, regulation of candidate effectors and methylation frequencies. The A-compartment is more gene-dense and contains most core genes, while the B-compartment is more repeat-rich and has higher rates of chromosomal rearrangement. While the B-compartment is transcriptionally repressed, it has significantly more secreted proteins and in planta up-regulated candidate effectors, suggesting a possible host-induced change in chromosome conformation. Overall, this study provides a fine-scale view into the genome biology and evolution of prominent plant symbionts, and opens avenues to study the epigenetic mechanisms that modify chromosome folding during host-microbe interactions.",

    "abstract": "Development of mammalian red blood cells involves progressive chromatin compaction and subsequent enucleation in terminal stages of differentiation, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the three-dimensional chromatin reorganization and compaction remains obscure. Here, we systematically analyze the distinct features of higher-order chromatin in purified populations of primary human erythroblasts. Our results reveal that while heterochromatin regions undergo substantial compression, select transcription competent regions with active transcription signature are preferentially maintained to achieve a highly-compacted yet functional chromatin state in terminal erythropoiesis, which is about 20-30% of the nuclear volume compared to that of erythroid progenitors. While the partition of euchromatic and heterochromatic regions (compartment A and B) remain mostly unchanged, H3K9me3 marks relocalize to the nuclear periphery and a significant number of H3K9me3 long-range interactions are formed in the three-dimensional rewiring during terminal erythroid chromatin condensation. Moreover, [~]63% of the topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries are disrupted, while certain TADs with active chromatin modification are selectively maintained during terminal erythropoiesis. The most well-maintained TADs are enriched for chromatin structural factors CTCF and SMC3, as well as factors and marks of the active transcription state. Finally, we demonstrate that the erythroid master regulator GATA1 involves in safeguarding select essential chromatin domains during terminal erythropoiesis. Our study therefore delineate the molecular characteristics of a development-driven chromatin compaction process, which reveals transcription competence as a key determinant of the select domain maintenance to ensure appropriate gene expression during immense chromatin compaction.",

    "abstract": "The clinical importance of the hematopoietic system makes it one of the most heavily studied lineages in all of biology. A clear understanding of the cell types and functional programs during hematopoietic development is central to research in aging, cancer, and infectious diseases. Known cell types are traditionally identified by the expression of proteins on the surface of the cells. Stem and progenitor cells defined based on these markers are assigned functions based on their lineage potential. The rapid growth of single cell RNA sequencing technologies (scRNAseq) provides a new modality for evaluating the cellular and functional landscape of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The popularity of this technology among hematopoiesis researchers enables us to conduct a robust meta-analysis of mouse bone marrow scRNAseq data. Using over 300,000 cells across 12 datasets, we evaluate the classification and function of cell types based on discrete clustering, in silico FACS sorting, and a continuous trajectory. We identify replicable signatures that define cell types based on genes and known cellular functions. Additionally, we evaluate the conservation of signatures associated with erythroid and monocyte lineage development across species using co-expression networks. The co-expression networks predict the effectiveness of the signature at identifying erythroid and monocyte cells in zebrafish and human scRNAseq data. Together, this analysis provides a robust reference, particularly marker genes and functional annotations, for future experiments in hematopoietic development.\n\nKey PointsO_LIMeta-analysis of 9 mouse bone marrow scRNAseq identifies markers for cell types and hematopoietic development\nC_LIO_LICharacterize a replicable functional landscape of cell types by exploiting co-expression\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Human cells acquire somatic mutations throughout life, some of which can drive clonal expansion. Such expansions are frequent in the haematopoietic system of healthy individuals and have been termed clonal haematopoiesis (CH). While CH predisposes to myeloid neoplasia and other diseases, we have limited understanding of how and when CH develops, what factors govern its behaviour, how it interacts with ageing and how these variables relate to malignant progression. Here, we track 697 CH clones from 385 individuals aged 55 or older over a median of 13 years. We find that 92.4% of clones expanded at a stable exponential rate over the study period, with different mutations driving substantially different growth rates, ranging from 5% (DNMT3A, TP53) to over 50%/yr (SRSF2-P95H). Growth rates of clones with the same mutation differed by approximately +/-5%/yr, proportionately impacting \"slow\" drivers more substantially. By combining our time-series data with phylogenetic analysis of 1,731 whole genome-sequenced haematopoietic colonies from 7 older individuals, we reveal distinct patterns of lifelong clonal behaviour. DNMT3A-mutant clones preferentially expanded early in life and displayed slower growth in old age, in the context of an increasingly competitive oligoclonal landscape. By contrast, splicing gene mutations only drove expansion later in life, while growth of TET2-mutant clones showed minimal age-dependency. Finally, we show that mutations driving faster clonal growth carry a higher risk of malignant progression. Our findings characterise the lifelong natural history of CH and give fundamental insights into the interactions between somatic mutation, ageing and clonal selection.",

    "abstract": "The induction of apoptosis upon USP7 (HAUSP) inhibition is established in cancers that contain a wild-type p53 (p53Wt) through the  USP7-Mdm2-p53 axis, but no clear explanation has yet been reported for the same to occur in cancers containing mutant 53 (p53Mut) or even p53 null (p53Null) systems. Instead of this  USP7-Mdm2-p53 axis USP7 also works through an alternative new pathway identified in this study. Here in this study, we observed that the magnitude of apoptosis induction in response to USP7 inhibition was remarkably similar between cancer cells showing p53Null or p53Mut and those with p53Wt. Through a proteomics-based approach, we were able to identify XIAP as a novel interacting partner for USP7. XIAP is a potent and well-characterized member of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), which function through caspase inhibition. We successfully identified USP7 as a positive regulator of XIAP at post-translational but not at its transcriptional level. Using molecular modelling coupled with domain deletion studies, we show that the first three Ubl domains in association with the catalytic domain of USP7 interact with the BIR2 and the linker region between BIR2 and BIR3 domains of XIAP. Modulation of expression and catalytic activity of USP7 in multiple type of cancer cell lines showed that USP7 stabilizes XIAP through its deubiquitinase activity. We have also observed that USP7 sensitizes cells against chemotherapeutic drugs through stabilization of XIAP. Thus, USP7 promotes tumorigenesis in multiple cancers, via stabilization of XIAP that results in apoptosis inhibition in caspase dependent pathway. Moreover, we observed that combinatorial inhibition of USP7 and XIAP can induce cellular apoptosis in a higher magnitude than their individual inhibition. Additionally, our results indicates that nanoformulated P5091 and P22077 showed higher potency for killing C6 cells in comparison to normal drugs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on identification and validation of XIAP, a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a novel substrate of the deubiquitinase USP7 and they together involve in empowerment of the tumorigenic potential of cancer cells.",

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) genetic variants are risk factors for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. A soluble TREM2 isoform (sTREM2) is elevated in cerebrospinal fluid in the early stages of AD suggesting it may be a biomarker of progressive alterations in immune response to AD-related pathology. Multiple studies have reported an altered peripheral immune response in AD. However, less is known about the relationship between plasma sTREM2 and the altered peripheral immune response in AD. The objective of this exploratory study was to examine the relationship between sTREM2 and inflammatory activity in human participants defined by clinically characterized cognitive symptoms and groups defined by the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers amyloid beta, phosphorylated tau, and neurodegeneration (NIA-AA Research Framework: \"ATN continuum\".) The hypothesis of this exploratory study was that sTREM2 related inflammatory activity differs by AD stage. We observed different patterns of inflammatory activity across disease groups and ATN categories that implicates peripheral sTREM2 related inflammatory activity as altered in the early stages of AD. Notably, fractalkine showed a significant relationship with sTREM2 across different analyses in the control groups that was lost as disease progressed, and fractalkine, IL-5 and IL-17A were decreased in AD. These preliminary data provide important support to the hypothesis that sTREM2-related inflammatory activity is a stage-specific biomarker of AD progression, providing the groundwork for future studies and therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, the monopolar localization of enzymes and protein complexes can result in a bi-modal distribution of enzyme activity between the dividing cells and heterogeneity of cellular behaviors. In Shewanella putrefaciens, the multidomain hybrid diguanylate cyclase/phosphodiesterase PdeB, which degrades the secondary messenger c-di-GMP, is located at the flagellated cell pole. Here we show how PdeB polar recruitment is mediated by direct interaction between the inactive diguanylate cyclase (GGDEF) domain of PdeB and the C-terminal FimV domain of the polar landmark protein HubP. We demonstrate that this interaction is crucial for full function of PdeB as a phosphodiesterase. Thus, the GGDEF domain serves as a spatially controlled on-switch that effectively restricts PdeBs activity to the flagellated cell pole. We further show that PdeB regulates abundance and activity of at least two crucial surface-interaction factors, the BpfA surface adhesion protein and the MSHA type IV pilus. The heterogeneity in c-di-GMP concentrations that is generated by differences in abundance and temporal polar appearance of PdeB as well as by bi-modal distribution after cell fission orchestrates the population behavior with respect to cell-surface interaction and environmental spreading.\n\nSignificancePhenotypic heterogeneity benefits the proliferation of microbial populations in changing environments. Such heterogeneity can be created by recruitment of enzymatic activity to specific cellular compartments, e.g., the cell pole. Here we show how a GGDEF domain of a multidomain phosphodiesterase has adopted the function as a spatial on-switch that is specifically activated upon direct interaction with a polar landmark protein.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical stress and the stiffness of the extracellular matrix are key drivers of tissue development and homeostasis. Aberrant mechanosensation is associated with a wide range of pathologies, including diseases such as osteoarthritis. Substrate stiffness is one of the well-known mechanical properties of the matrix that enabled establishing the central dogma of an integrin-mediated mechanotransduction using stem cells. However, how specific cells  feel or sense substrate stiffness requires further study. The primary cilium is an essential cellular organelle that senses and integrates mechanical and chemical signals from the extracellular environment. We hypothesised that the primary cilium dynamically alters its length and position to fine-tune cell mechanosignalling based on substrate stiffness alone. We used a hydrogel system of varying substrate stiffness to examine the role of substrate stiffness on cilia frequency, length and centriole position as well as cell and nuclei area over time. Contrary to other cell types, we show that chondrocyte primary cilia shorten on softer substrates demonstrating tissue-specific mechanosensing which is aligned with the tissue stiffness the cells originate from. We further show that stiffness alone determines centriole positioning to either the basal or apical membrane during attachment and spreading, with centriole positioned towards the basal membrane on stiffer substrates. These phenomena are mediated by force generation actin-myosin stress fibres in a time-dependent manner. Based on these findings, we propose that substrate stiffness plays a central role in cilia positioning, regulating cellular response to external forces, and may be a key driver of mechanosignalling-associated diseases.\n\nSignificance StatementThe primary cilium has been thrust into the limelight owing to its role as a cellular sensor in embryonic development and adult tissue maintenance. How the primary cilium interacts with the mechanical environment still remains unclear. We show that substrate stiffness dynamically regulates primary cilium length and position through integrin-mediated traction forces, the cilia are a key determinant of cell shape on certain stiffnesses. Our data support the promising potential of primary cilia as a novel target in mechanotherapy for improved clinical outcomes in cartilage pathobiology.",

    "abstract": "During mitosis, unattached kinetochores in a dividing cell activate the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) and delay anaphase onset by generating the anaphase-inhibitory Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC). These kinetochores generate the MCC by recruiting MCC constituent proteins, including BubR1. In principle, BubR1 recruitment to signaling kinetochores should increase its local concentration and promote MCC formation. However, in human cells BubR1 is mainly thought to sensitize the SAC to silencing; whether BubR1 localization to signaling kinetochores per se enhances SAC signaling activity remains unknown. Therefore, we used ectopic SAC activation systems (eSAC) to isolate two molecules that recruit BubR1 to the kinetochore: the checkpoint protein Bub1 and the KI and MELT motifs in the kinetochore protein KNL1, and observed their contribution to eSAC signaling. Our quantitative analyses and mathematical modeling show that the Bub1-mediated BubR1 recruitment to the human kinetochore promotes SAC signaling and highlight BubR1s dual role of directly strengthening the SAC and indirectly silencing it.",

    "abstract": "NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) regulates endothelial inflammation by producing reactive oxygen species. Since coenzyme Q (CoQ) mimics affect NOX4 activity, we hypothesize that cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3), a CoQ reductase abundant in vascular endothelial cells, modulates inflammatory activation.\n\nMice lacking endothelial CYB5R3 (R3 KO), under lipopolysaccharides (LPS) challenge, showed exacerbated hypotension, decreased acetylcholine-induced vasodilation, and elevated vascular adhesion molecule 1 (Vcam-1) mRNA in aorta. In vitro, silencing Cyb5r3 enhanced LPS-induced VCAM-1 protein in a NOX4 dependent manner. APEX2- based electron microscopy and proximity biotinylation demonstrated CYB5R3s localization on the mitochondrial outer membrane and its interaction with NOX4, which was further confirmed by the proximity ligation assay. Notably, Cyb5r3 silenced HAECs had less total H2O2 but more mitochondrial O2*-. Using inactive or non-membrane bound active CYB5R3, we found CYB5R3 activity and membrane translocation were needed for optimal generation of H2O2 by NOX4. Lastly, CoQ deficient cells showed decreased NOX4-derived H2O2, indicating a requirement for endogenous CoQ in NOX4 activity.\n\nIn conclusion, CYB5R3 mitigates endothelial inflammatory activation by assisting in NOX4-dependent H2O2 generation via CoQ.\n\nNOVELTY AND SIGNIFICANCEO_ST_ABSWhat Is Known?C_ST_ABSNADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) reportedly produces primarily hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and, to a lesser extent, superoxide (O2*-) and has been shown to have both beneficial and deleterious effects in the cardiovascular system.\n\nNOX4 activity can be affected by NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), a CoQ reductase, and synthetic quinone compounds used to mimic CoQ.\n\nCytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3) is known to reduce CoQ and is highly expressed in endothelial cells.\n\nWhat New Information Does This Article Contribute?In vivo, the lack of endothelial CYB5R3 causes exacerbated lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced inflammatory signaling, endothelial dysfunction, and hypotension.\n\nEndothelial CYB5R3 mitigates inflammatory signaling by LPS and tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-) in a NOX4 dependent manner.\n\nIn endothelial cells, CYB5R3 and NOX4 reside in close proximity on the mitochondrial outer membrane.\n\nNOX4s ability to generate H2O2 depends on the membrane translocation and activity of CYB5R3 and the presence of endogenous CoQ.\n\nNONSTANDARD Abbreviations and Acronyms\n[Table 1]\n\nProtein names are abbreviated as capital letters (e.g., CYB5R3), while the corresponding gene names are annotated as in italic lower cases (e.g., Cyb5r3).",

In C. elegans, DIG-1 is a giant ECM component that is required for fasciculation of sensory dendrites during development and for maintenance of axon positions throughout life. We identified four novel alleles of dig-1 in three independent screens for mutants affecting disparate aspects of neuronal and glial morphogenesis. First, we find that disruption of DIG-1 causes fragmentation of the amphid sheath glial cell in larvae and young adults. Second, it causes severing of the BAG sensory dendrite from its terminus at the nose tip, apparently due to breakage of the dendrite as animals reach adulthood. Third, it causes embryonic defects in dendrite fasciculation in inner labial (IL2) sensory neurons, as previously reported, as well as rare defects in IL2 dendrite extension that are enhanced by loss of the apical ECM component DYF-7, suggesting that apical and basolateral ECM contribute separately to dendrite extension. Our results highlight novel roles for DIG-1 in maintaining the cellular integrity of neurons and glia, possibly by creating a barrier between structures in the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWEpigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) aim to provide evidence that marks of DNA methylation (DNAm) have downstream consequences that can result in the development of human diseases. Although these methods have been successful in identifying DNAm patterns associated with disease states, any further characterization of etiologic mechanisms underlying disease remains elusive. This knowledge gap does not originate from a lack of DNAm-trait associations, but rather stems from study design issues that affect the interpretability of EWAS results. Despite known limitations in predicting the function of a particular CpG site, most EWAS maintain the broad assumption that altered DNAm results in a concomitant change of transcription at the most proximal gene. This study integrated DNAm and gene expression (GE) measurements in two cohorts, the Adolescent and Young Adult Twin Study (AYATS) and the Pregnancy, Race, Environment, Genes (PREG) study, to improve the understanding of epigenomic regulatory mechanisms. CpG sites associated with GE in cis were enriched in areas of transcription factor binding and areas of intermediate-to-low CpG density. CpG sites associated with trans GE were also enriched in areas of known regulatory significance, including enhancer regions. These results highlight issues with restricting DNAm-transcript annotations to small genomic intervals and question the validity of assuming a canonical cis DNAm-GE pathway. Based on these findings, the interpretation of EWAS results is limited in studies without multi-omic support and further research should identify genomic regions in which GE-associated DNAm is overrepresented.",

While mule deer are excellent candidates for population genomic studies because of their large population size, continuous distribution, and diversity of habitat, few genomic resources are currently available for this species. Here, we sequence and assemble the mule deer genome into a highly contiguous chromosome-length assembly for use in future research using long-read sequencing and Hi-C. We also provide a genome annotation and compare demographic histories of the mule deer and white-tail deer using PSMC.

    "abstract": "Genes are commonly abstracted into a coding sequence and cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as promoters and terminators, and short sequence motifs within these regions. Modern cloning techniques allow easy assembly of synthetic genetic constructs from discrete cis-regulatory modules. However, it is unclear how much the contributions of CREs to gene expression depend on other CREs in the host gene. Using budding yeast, we probe the extent of composability, or independent effects, of distinct CREs. We confirm that the quantitative effect of a terminator on gene expression depends on both promoter and coding sequence. We then explore whether individual cisregulatory motifs within terminator regions display similar context dependence, using transcriptomewide datasets of mRNA decay. To test the extent of composability, we construct reporter genes consisting of combinations of motifs within various terminator contexts, paired with different promoters. Our results show that the effect of a motif on RNA abundance depends both on its host terminator, and also on the associated promoter sequence. This emphasises the need for improved motif inference that includes both local and global context effects, which in turn could aid in the accurate use of CREs for the engineering of synthetic genetic constructs.",

    "abstract": "Neural crest cells (NCCs) are a migratory population that gives rise to a diverse cell lineage, including the craniofacial complex, the peripheral nervous system, and a part of the heart. Hyaluronan (HA) is a major component of the extracellular matrix, and its tissue levels are dynamically regulated in during development. Although the synthesis of HA has been shown to exert substantial influence on embryonic morphogenesis, the functional importance of the catabolic side of HA turnover is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the transmembrane hyaluronidase TMEM2 plays an essential role in NCC development and the morphogenesis of their derivatives. Wnt1-Cre-mediated Tmem2 knockout (Tmem2CKO) mice exhibit severe craniofacial and cardiovascular abnormalities. Analysis of Tmem2 expression using Tmem2 knock-in reporter mice reveals that Tmem2 is expressed at the site of NCC delamination in the neural tube and in Sox9-positive emigrating NCCs, suggesting that Tmem2 is critical for NCC development. Consistent with this possibility, linage tracing analysis reveals that the contribution of Wnt1-Cre-labeled cells to NCC derivatives is significantly reduced in a Tmem2-deficient background. Moreover, the emigration of NCCs from the neural tube is greatly reduced in Tmem2CKO mice. In vitro assays demonstrate that Tmem2 expression is essential for the ability of mouse O9-1 NCCs to form focal adhesion on and migrate into HA-containing substrates. Tmem2CKO mice also exhibit increased apoptotic cell death in NCC-derived tissues. Collectively, our data demonstrate that Tmem2 is essential for normal development of NCC-derivatives, including the craniofacial complex, and that TMEM2-mediated HA degradation allows NCCs to generate a tissue environment suitable for efficient focal adhesion assembly and migration. This study reveals the hitherto unrecognized functional importance of the catabolic side of HA metabolism in embryonic development and highlights the pivotal role of Tmem2 in the process.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe functional significance of hyaluronan (HA) in embryonic developmental processes has been demonstrated by studies using genetic manipulation of HA synthesis. However, the expression of HA is regulated not only by its synthesis, but also by its degradation. This issue is of particular importance due to the extremely rapid metabolic turnover of HA. Curiously, mice with mutations/ablations of known hyaluronidase molecules, such as the lysosomal hyaluronidases HYAL1 and HYAL2, exhibit little embryonic phenotypes. This suggests the existence of yet another hyaluronidase molecule that plays a key role in regulating extracellular HA balance in developing tissues. In this context, transmembrane protein 2 (TMEM2) is a novel hyaluronidase that functions on the cell surface. Here, we demonstrate that TMEM2 is expressed at the site of neural crest development and in neural crest cell (NSC)-derived craniofacial tissue, and that NCC-targeted Tmem2 conditional knockout mice develop severe craniofacial defects, which attests to a requirement for TMEM2-mediated extracellular HA degradation in neural crest development. Our in vitro and in vivo analyses on the underlying mechanisms of the phenotype demonstrate that TMEM2 is essential for generating a tissue environment suitable for efficient focal adhesion formation by NCCs. This paper reveals for the first time that the catabolic machinery for HA exerts a specific regulatory role in embryonic morphogenesis, and that its dysregulation of HA degradation leads to severe developmental defects.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the species richness and distribution of carnivores across anthropogenic land-use types in an area is an essential first step for biodiversity conservation and human-carnivore coexistence. However, quantitative data on carnivore species coexisting with humans in different land-use types remain largely missing. Thus, this paper investigated the effect of anthropogenic land-use and landscape drivers on carnivore species richness and distribution in the Faragosa-Fura Landscape, Gamo Zone, southern Ethiopia. To collect data, we employed the line transect method using three complementary field surveys techniques: sign survey, camera-trapping, and opportunistic sighting survey during wet and dry seasons in 2020 and 2021. We stratified the study landscape into five land-use types-forest, wetland, grassland, agricultural land, and settlement. The result proved the occurrence of 12 carnivore species belonging to six families, including vulnerable Felidae species - Panthera pardus. Family Felidae and Herpestidae were composed of a greater number of species, while Hyaenidae and Mustelidae were each represented by single species. Out of identified species, only two species (Panthera pardus and Crocuta crocuta) were large-sized, while the rest were medium and small-sized carnivores. Overall, the mean richness of the study area was 5.73{+/-}0.284(SE). The species richness was highest in the wetland (n = 12, mean = 7.67{+/-}0.494(SE)) and lowest in the settlement (n = 5, mean = 4.25{+/-}0.479(SE)). The regression analysis showed that most of the carnivores displayed a strong negative relationship with agriculture, roads, and settlement while displayed a strong positive relationship with wetland and forest. In general, out of 32 species recorded in Ethiopia, this study quantified 12 carnivore species that signify the area is an important area for wildlife conservation in Ethiopia. Further, the study concluded that the wetland is the most important habitat, particularly for larger-sized and habitat specialists while anthropogenic land-uses types adversely affecting species richness. Thus, a generic paradigm to reconcile land management and biodiversity conservation is highly important.",

These changes in Brazil depend on the interlink between global factors, due to its role as one of the main exporters of commodities in the world, and the national to local institutional, socioeconomic and biophysical contexts. Aiming to develop scenarios that consider the balance between global and local factors, a new set of land use change scenarios for Brazil were developed, aligned with the global structure Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCPs) developed by the global change research community. The narratives of the new scenarios align with SSP1/RCP 1.9, SSP2/RCP 4.5, and SSP3/RCP 7.0. The scenarios were developed combining the LuccME spatially explicit land change allocation modeling framework and the INLAND surface model to incorporate the climatic variables in water deficit. Based on detailed biophysical, socio-economic and institutional factors for each biome in Brazil, we have created spatially-explicit scenarios until 2050, considering the following classes: forest vegetation, grassland vegetation, planted pasture, agriculture, mosaic of small land uses, and forestry.

Upon disruption of the PTP7 locus, the Maurers cleft trafficking compartments become decorated with vesicles; the knobby protrusions on the host red blood cell surface are depleted and distorted; and trafficking of the virulence protein, EMP1, to the host red blood cell surface is ablated.

    "abstract": "Biological indicators (bioindicators) can be individual species or species groups used to assess habitat quality. Unfortunately, conservationists often lack information on species distribution, how to differentiate between similar species, and environmental conditions associated with the presence of a species. We addressed these problems using two \"sister\" species of fish, the Mottled Sculpin (Cottus bairdii) and the Slimy Sculpin (Cottus cognatus), as stream quality indicators in the Manistee River watershed in the Huron-Manistee National Forests in Michigan, USA. We determined the abundance and distribution of these species and related their presence to concurrent in-stream measurements of temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, turbidity, and stream quality score based on macroinvertebrate diversity. To be certain of identification, we sequenced the Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit I (CO1) molecular marker for specimens and used it as a DNA barcode to determine a specimens species. Cladistic analyses of CO1 unambiguously supported recognition of Mottled Sculpin and Slimy Sculpin as distinct species, confirming initial 87.5% correct identification using morphological characteristics, with uncertainty limited to juvenile fish. Field determinations increased to 100% correct identification as investigators gained more experience. Both species were most abundant in headwater regions, decreased downstream, and were sympatric at several locations. Mottled Sculpin were more likely to be found at stream locations with lower conductivity, pH, and stream quality scores, whereas Slimy Sculpin presence was more strongly associated higher levels of DO and lower levels of turbidity. Such findings are important because Mottled Sculpin are a designated management indicator species of the US Forest Service in the Huron-Manistee National Forests, but may be ineffective as a habitat quality indicator when used alone. Concurrent use of Mottled Sculpin and Slimy Sculpin as a management indicator sister-species complex could allow sufficient landscape coverage to permit habitat assessment if species-specific differences in environmental tolerances are precisely determined.",

    "abstract": "While fluid resuscitation is fundamental in the treatment of sepsis-induced tissue hypo-perfusion, a sustained positive fluid balance is associated with excess mortality. Crystalloids are the mainstay of fluid resuscitation and use of either synthetic colloids or albumin is controversial. Hyaluronan, an endogenous glycosaminoglycan with high affinity to water, has not been tested as adjuvant in fluid resuscitation.\n\nWe sought to evaluate the effects of hyaluronan as an adjuvant to fluid resuscitation in peritonitis induced sepsis. In a prospective, parallel-grouped, blinded model of porcine peritonitis-sepsis, we randomized animals to intervention with adjuvant hyaluronan (add-on to standard therapy) (n=8) or 0.9% saline (n=8). After the onset of hemodynamic instability the animals received an initial bolus of 0.1 % hyaluronan 1 mg/kg/10 min or placebo (saline) followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1% hyaluronan (1 mg/kg/h) or saline during the experiment. We hypothesized that the administration of hyaluronan would reduce the volume of fluid administered (aiming at stroke volume variation <13%) and/or attenuate the inflammatory reaction.\n\nTotal volumes of intravenous fluids infused were 17.5 {+/-} 11 ml/kg/h vs. 19.0 {+/-} 7 ml/kg/h in intervention and control groups, respectively (p = 0.442). Plasma IL-6 increased to 2450 (1420 - 6890) pg/ml and 3700 (1410 - 11960) pg/ml (18 hours of resuscitation) in the intervention and control groups (NS). In a post-hoc analysis, modified shock index remained lower in intervention group (p = 0.011 - 0.037).\n\nIn conclusion adjuvant hyaluronan did not reduce the volume needed for fluid administration or decrease the inflammatory reaction. Adjuvant hyaluronan was, however, associated with lower modified shock index. Bearing in mind that the experiment has a limited group-size we suggest that further studies on hyaluronan in sepsis are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an RNA virus encapsulated by a spike (S) glycoprotein envelope, binds with high affinity to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) during cell entry of a susceptible host. Recent studies suggest nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play a role in functional ACE2 regulation and nicotine may contribute to the progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we present evidence for coupling between ACE2 and nAChR through bioinformatic analysis and cell culture experiments. Following molecular and structural protein comparison of over 250 ACE2 vertebrate orthologues, a region of human ACE2 at positions C542-L554 was identified to have sequence similarity to nAChR-binding neurotoxin and rabies virus glycoproteins (RBVG). Furthermore, experiments conducted in PC12 cells indicate a potential for physical interaction between ACE2 and 7 nAChR proteins. Our findings support a model of nAChR involvement in in COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock is entrained to daily environmental cues. Integrin-linked intracellular signaling via actin cytoskeleton dynamics transduces cellular niche signals to induce Myocardin-related Transcription Factor (MRTF)/Serum Response Factor (SRF)-mediated transcription. So far, how the integrin-associated signaling cascade may transmit cellular physical cues to entrain circadian clock remains to be defined. Using combined pharmacological and genetic approaches, here we show that the transcription factors mediating integrin to actin cytoskeleton signaling, MRTF-A and SRF, exert direct transcriptional control of core clock components, and that this signaling cascade modulates key properties of clock circadian activity. Pharmacological inhibition of MRTF/SRF activity by disrupting actin polymerization significantly augmented clock amplitude with period shortening, whereas an actin polymerizing compound attenuated oscillation amplitude with period lengthening. Genetic loss-of-function of Srf or Mrtf mimics that of actin-depolymerizing agents, validating the role of actin dynamics in driving clock function. Furthermore, integrin-mediated focal adhesion with extracellular matrix and its downstream signaling modulates the circadian clock, as blockade of integrin, focal adhesion kinase or Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) increased clock amplitude and shortened period length. Mechanistically, we identify specific core clock transcription regulators, Per1, Per2 and Nr1d1, as direct target genes of MRTF-A/SRF. Collectively, our findings uncovered an integrin-actin cytoskeleton-MRTF/SRF signaling cascade in linking clock entrainment to its extracellular microenvironment, which may mediate cellular adaptation to its physical niche.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe circadian clock anticipates and adapts to environmental changes. Interestingly, serum, as a universal clock synchronizing signal, drives intracellular actin cytoskeleton reorganization through modulation of MRTF/SRF activity. However, mechanisms that may transduce extracellular niche signals to circadian clock remains to be defined. We hypothesize that integrin-mediated intracellular signaling to actin cytoskeleton links extracellular microenvironment with MRTF/SRF transcriptional regulation to control clock function. Using small molecules and genetic approaches targeting distinct steps of integrin-actin cytoskeleton-MRTF/SRF signaling cascade, we uncover the effects of this pathway in controlling circadian clock oscillation. We also identify specific core clock regulators as direct gene target genes of MRTF and SRF-mediated transcriptional control. Our study revealed how integrin-mediated cellular interaction with its physical environment influences its intrinsic clock properties through signaling transduction via actin cytoskeleton remodeling, and that this mechanism may facilitate circadian clock adaptation to cellular physical niche.",

    "abstract": "The distributions of the potential adaptive ranges of iconic plant species are not yet fully known especially in regions such as Ethiopia where high climatic variability and vegetation types are found. This study was undertaken to predict the distributions of the potential suitable habitats of Pouteria adolfi-friederici and Prunus africana tree species under the current and two future climate scenarios (i.e., RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 in 2050 and 2070) using MaxEnt software (version: 3.4.4.). Eleven less correlated environmental variables (r<0.7) were identified and used to make the prediction models. Elevational shifts of the highly suitable habitats, effects of elevation, solar radiation and topographic position in relation to the current and future climatic scenarios on the habitats were statistically analyzed using independent t-test and linear model. Under all climate scenarios, we found a decrease in the proportion of areas of highly suitable habitats for both study species. High potentials of suitable habitats for Pouteria adolfi-friederici are predicted to be confined to southwest, west central and south parts of Ethiopia in fragmented moist afromontane forest patches, while it is in the southwest and west central parts of Ethiopia for Prunus africana. On basis of vegetation types of the country, potential suitable habitats for Pouteria adolfi-friederici are predicted to occur in moist evergreen forest, dry evergreen forest and grassland complex and Combretum-Terminalia woodland vegetation types. Whereas, moist evergreen forest, dry evergreen forest and grassland complex and riverine vegetation types are predicted to comprise potential suitable habitats for Prunus africana, showing considerable spatial dynamics. Overall, our results suggest that the strategies deem to design biodiversity conservation should take into account the dynamics of the suitable niches of different species under different future climate scenarios.",

With simulations, we demonstrate how fastGLOBETROTTER reduces computation time by 4-20 fold relative to the haplotype-based technique GLOBETROTTER without suffering loss of accuracy. We apply fastGLOBETROTTER to a cohort of >6000 Europeans from ten countries, revealing previously unreported admixture signals. In particular we infer multiple periods of admixture related to East Asian or Siberian-like sources, starting >2000 years ago, in people living in countries north of the Baltic Sea. In contrast, we infer admixture related to West Asian, North African and/or Southern European sources in populations south of the Baltic Sea, including admixture dated to {approx}300-700CE, overlapping the fall of the Roman Empire, in people from Belgium, France and parts of Germany. Our new approach scales to analysing hundreds to thousands of individuals from a putatively admixed populations and hence is applicable to emerging large-scale cohorts of genetically homogeneous populations.",

    "abstract": "Although the cerebellum has been traditionally considered to be exclusively involved in motor control, recent anatomical and clinical studies show that it also has a role in reward-processing. However, the way in which the movement related and the reward related neural activity interact at the level of the cerebellar cortex and contribute towards learning is still unclear. Here, we studied the simple spike activity of Purkinje cells in the mid-lateral cerebellum when monkeys learned to associate a right or left-hand movement with one of two visual symbolic cues. These cells had distinctly different discharge patterns between an overtrained symbol-hand association and a novel symbol-hand association, responding in association with the movement of both hands, although the kinematics of the movement did not change between the two conditions. The activity change was not related to the pattern of the visual symbols, the movement kinematics, the monkeys reaction times or the novelty of the visual symbols. The simple spike activity changed with throughout the learning process, but the concurrent complex spikes did not instruct that change. Although these neurons also have reward-related activity, the reward-related and movement-related signals were independent. We suggest that this mixed-selectivity may facilitate the flexible learning of difficult reinforcement learning problems.",
