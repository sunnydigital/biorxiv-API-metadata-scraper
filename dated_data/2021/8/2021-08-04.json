    "abstract": "Antibody responses serve as the primary protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection through neutralization of viral entry into cells. We have developed a two-dimensional multiplex bead binding assay (2D-MBBA) that quantifies multiple antibody isotypes against multiple antigens from a single measurement. Here, we applied our assay to profile IgG, IgM and IgA levels against the spike antigen, its receptor-binding domain and natural and designed mutants. Machine learning algorithms trained on the 2D-MBBA data substantially improve the prediction of neutralization capacity against the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus of serum samples of convalescent patients. The algorithms also helped identify a set of antibody isotype-antigen datasets that contributed to the prediction, which included those targeting regions outside the receptor-binding interface of the spike protein. We applied the assay to profile samples from vaccinated, immune-compromised patients, which revealed differences in the antibody profiles between convalescent and vaccinated samples. Our approach can rapidly provide deep antibody profiles and neutralization prediction from essentially a drop of blood without the need of BSL-3 access and provides insights into the nature of neutralizing antibodies. It may be further developed for evaluating neutralizing capacity for new variants and future pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Re-emerging viral threats have continued to challenge the medical and public health systems. It has become clear that a significant number of severe viral infection cases are due to an overreaction of the immune system, which leads to hyperinflammation. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of the dexamethasone nanomedicine in controlling the symptoms of influenza infection. We found that the A/Wisconsin/WSLH34939/2009 (H1N1) infection induced severe pneumonia in mice with a death rate of 80%, accompanied by significant epithelial cell damage, infiltration of immune cells, and accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the airway space. Moreover, the intranasal delivery of liposomal dexamethasone during disease progression reduced the death rate by 20%. It also significantly reduced the protein level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), interleukin1{beta} (IL-1{beta}), IL-6, and the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2) as well as the number of infiltrated immune cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids as compared to the free drug. It was found that the liposomal dexamethasone was mainly distributed into the monocyte/macrophages in the lungs, suggesting its mode of action via the specific delivery of the drug into myeloid cells as a major cell population for inducing the cytokine storm. Taken together, the intranasal delivery of liposomal dexamethasone may serve as a novel promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of influenza A-induced pneumonia.\n\nImportanceInfluenza A virus causes annual epidemics and sporadic pandemics of respiratory diseases. An excessive immune response, called a cytokine storm, caused by the influenza virus is the most common complication of influenza infection that is associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. Here, we report that the liposomal dexamethasone targeting the monocytes/macrophages during disease progression reduced the death rate as well as the protein level of inflammatory cytokines and the number of immune cells. Therefore, the findings of this study may be applied to address the limitations of the current strategies for the treatment of influenza.",

    "abstract": "AlphaFold2 and related systems use deep learning to predict protein structure from co-evolutionary relationships encoded in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Despite dramatic, recent increases in accuracy, three challenges remain: (i) prediction of orphan and rapidly evolving proteins for which an MSA cannot be generated, (ii) rapid exploration of designed structures, and (iii) understanding the rules governing spontaneous polypeptide folding in solution. Here we report development of an end-to-end differentiable recurrent geometric network (RGN) able to predict protein structure from single protein sequences without use of MSAs. This deep learning system has two novel elements: a protein language model (AminoBERT) that uses a Transformer to learn latent structural information from millions of unaligned proteins and a geometric module that compactly represents C backbone geometry. RGN2 outperforms AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold (as well as trRosetta) on orphan proteins and is competitive with designed sequences, while achieving up to a 106-fold reduction in compute time. These findings demonstrate the practical and theoretical strengths of protein language models relative to MSAs in structure prediction.",

    "abstract": "The single-photon timing and sensitivity performance and the imaging ability of asynchronous-readout single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detectors have opened up enormous perspectives in fluorescence (lifetime) laser scanning microscopy (FLSM), such as super-resolution image scanning microscopy and high-information content fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS). However, the strengths of these FLSM techniques depend on the many different characteristics of the detector, such as dark-noise, photon-detection efficiency, after-pulsing probability, and optical-cross talk, whose overall optimization is typically a trade-off between these characteristics. To mitigate this trade-off, we present a novel SPAD array detector with an active cooling system, which substantially reduces the dark-noise without significantly deteriorating any other detector characteristics. In particular, we show that lowering the temperature of the sensor to -15{degrees}C significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio due to a 10-fold decrease in the dark-count rate compared to room temperature. As a result, for imaging, the laser power can be decreased by more than a factor of three, which is particularly beneficial for live-cell super-resolution imaging, as demonstrated in fixed and living cells expressing GFP-tagged proteins. For FFS, together with the benefit of the reduced laser power, we show that cooling the detector is necessary to remove artifacts in the correlation function, such as spurious negative correlations observed in the hot elements of the detector, i.e., elements whose dark-noise is substantially higher than the median value. Overall, this detector represents a further step towards the integration of SPAD array detectors in any FLSM system.\n\nSIGNIFICANCESingle-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detectors are revolutionizing fluorescence laser-scanning microscopy (FLSM). Thanks to their single-photon timing and sensitivity ability and their imaging faculty, a SPAD array detector transforms any FLSM into a super-resolution microscope, and opens a whole range of possibilities for the study of sample dynamics by means of fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS). However, dark-noise can be a severe problem for both imaging and FFS. For imaging, the signal overcomes noise only for a relatively high illumination intensity, which can be detrimental for live-cell experiments. For FFS, the noise leads to artifacts in the correlation curves, potentially leading to wrong conclusions about the sample. We show that lowering the temperature of the detector to -15{degrees}C solves both problems",

    "abstract": "Copper(I) is essential for all life forms. Though Cu(II) is most abundant state in environment, its reduction to Cu(I) is prerequisite for bio-utilization, by a mechanism that is uncharacterized. We show that in human Copper Transporter-1, two amino-terminal methionine-histidine clusters and neighbouring aspartates distinctly binds Cu(II) and Cu(I) preceding its import. The endocytosis of hCTR1 from basolateral membrane of polarized epithelia to Common-Recycling-Endosomes is dependent on copper reduction and Cu(I) coordination by methionines. The transient binding of both Cu(II) and Cu(I) during the reduction process facilitated by aspartates acts as another crucial determinant of hCTR1 endocytosis. Mutating 7Met-Gly-Met9 and Asp13 abrogates copper uptake and endocytosis that is correctable by reduced and non-reoxidizable Cu(I). Histidines clusters are crucial for hCTR1 functioning at limiting copper. Finally, we show that two N-terminal His-Met-Asp clusters exhibit functional complementarity in regulating Cu(I)-induced hCTR1 endocytosis. We propose a mechanistic model where His-Met-Asp residues of amino-terminal hCTR1 coordinates copper and maintains its reduced state crucial for uptake.",

Despite such importance, mesenchymal cell types are poorly defined morphologically and molecularly, lagging behind their counterparts in the epithelial, endothelial, and immune lineages. Leveraging single-cell RNA-seq, three-dimensional imaging, and lineage tracing, we classify the mouse lung mesenchyme into three proximal-distal axes that are associated with the endothelium, epithelium, and interstitium, respectively. From proximal to distal, (1) the vascular axis includes vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes that transition as arterioles and venules ramify into capillaries; (2) the epithelial axis includes airway smooth muscle cells and two populations of myofibroblasts: ductal myofibroblasts, surrounding alveolar ducts and marked by CDH4, HHIP, and Lgr6, which persist post-alveologenesis, and alveolar myofibroblasts, surrounding alveoli and marked by high expression of PDGFRA, which undergo developmental apoptosis; (3) the interstitial axis, residing between the epithelial and vascular trees and sharing a newly-identified marker MEOX2, includes fibroblasts in the bronchovascular bundle and the alveolar interstitium that are marked by IL33/DNER/PI16 and Wnt2, respectively.

    "abstract": "Many bacteria form mats at the air-liquid interface of static microcosms. These structures typically involve the secretion of exopolysaccharide(s), the production of which is often controlled by the secondary messenger c-di-GMP. Mechanisms of mat formation have been particularly well characterized in Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25; mutations that lead to an increase in c-di-GMP production by diguanylate cyclases (WspR, AwsR, or MwsR) result in the secretion of cellulose, and mat formation. Here, we characterize and compare mat formation in two close relatives of SBW25: Pseudomonas simiae PICF7 and Pseudomonas fluorescens A506. We find that PICF7 - the strain more closely related to SBW25 - can form mats through mutations affecting the activity of the same three diguanylate cyclases as SBW25. However, instead of cellulose, these mutations activate the production of the Pel exopolysaccharide. We also provide evidence for at least two further - as yet uncharacterized - routes to PICF7 mat formation. P. fluorescens A506, while retaining the same mutational routes to mat formation as SBW25 and PICF7, forms mats by a semi-heritable mechanism that likely culminates in Pga and/or Psl production. Overall, our results demonstrate a high level of evolutionary flexibility in the molecular and structural routes to mat formation, even among close relatives.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of multicellularity is strongly correlated with the expansion of tyrosine kinases, a conserved family of signaling enzymes that regulates pathways essential for cell-to-cell communication. Although tyrosine kinases have been classified from several model organisms, a molecular-level understanding of tyrosine kinase evolution across all holozoans is currently lacking. Using a hierarchical sequence constraint-based classification of diverse holozoan tyrosine kinases, we construct a new phylogenetic tree that identifies two ancient clades of cytoplasmic and receptor tyrosine kinases separated by the presence of an extended insert segment in the kinase domain connecting the D and E helices. Present in nearly all receptor tyrosine kinases, this fast-evolving insertion imparts diverse functionalities such as post-translational modification sites and regulatory interactions. Eph and EGFR receptor tyrosine kinases are two exceptions which lack this insert, each forming an independent lineage characterized by unique functional features. We also identify common constraints shared across multiple tyrosine kinase families which warrant the designation of three new subgroups: Src Module (SrcM), Insulin Receptor Kinase-Like (IRKL), and Fibroblast, Platelet-derived, Vascular, and growth factor Receptors (FPVR). Subgroup-specific constraints reflect shared autoinhibitory interactions involved in kinase conformational regulation. Conservation analyses describe how diverse tyrosine kinase signaling functions arose through the addition of family-specific motifs upon subgroup-specific features and co-evolving protein domains. We propose the oldest tyrosine kinases, IRKL, SrcM, and Csk, originated from unicellular pre-metazoans and were co-opted for complex multicellular functions. The increased frequency of oncogenic variants in more recent tyrosine kinases suggests that lineage-specific functionalities are selectively altered in human cancers.",

This process often makes use of a probability model for the pattern of founder alleles along chromosomes, including the relative frequency of founder alleles and the probability of exchanges among them, which depend on a model for meiotic recombination and on the mating design for the population. While the precise experimental design used to generate the population may be used to derive a precise characterization of the model for exchanges among founder alleles, this can be tedious, particularly given the great variety of experimental designs that have been proposed.

Rapid TF degradation followed by measurement of genome-wide transcription rates revealed that core TFs directly regulate dramatically fewer genes than previously assumed.

IMPDH1 plays a unique role in retinal metabolism, and point mutants cause blindness and disrupt GTP regulation. Here, in a series of cryo-EM structures we show that IMPDH1 assembles polymorphic filaments with different assembly interfaces in active and inhibited states. Retina-specific splice variants introduce structural elements that reduce sensitivity to GTP inhibition, including stabilization of the active filament form. Finally, we show that IMPDH1 disease mutations fall into two classes: one disrupts GTP regulation and the other has no in vitro phenotype. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the role of IMPDH1 in retinal function and disease and demonstrate the diverse mechanisms by which metabolic enzyme filaments are allosterically regulated.",

In addition to its role as a cofactor, thiamin plays a key role in resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. Most of the studies used exogenous thiamin to enhance stress tolerance in plants. In this study, we achieved this objective by genetically engineering Arabidopsis thaliana and Camelina sativa for the seed-specific co-overexpression of the Arabidopsis thiamin biosynthetic genes Thi4, ThiC, and ThiE. Elevated thiamin content in the seeds of transgenic plants was accompanied by the enhanced expression levels of transcripts encoding thiamin cofactor-dependent enzymes. Furthermore, seed germination and root growth in thiamin over-producing lines were more tolerant to oxidative stress caused by salt and paraquat treatments. The transgenic seeds also accumulated more oil (up to16.4% in Arabidopsis and17.9% in C. sativa) and carbohydrate but less protein than the control seeds. The same results were also observed in TPP over-producing Arabidopsis plants generated by the seed-specific overexpression of TPK1. Together, our findings suggest that thiamin and TPP over-production in transgenic lines confer a boosted abiotic stress tolerance and alter the seed carbon partitioning as well.",

Different morphological and electrochemical characterizations showed that they exhibit remarkable and superior electrochemical properties, yielding microelectrodes combining high surface area, low impedance (16.8 {+/-} 2 M{Omega}.m2 at 1 kHz) and elevated charge injection capabilities (7.6 {+/-} 1.3 mC/cm2) that exceed those of pure and composite PEDOT layers. In addition, the PEDOT-CNF composite electrode exhibited extended biphasic charge cycle endurance, resulting in a negligible physical delamination or degradation for long periods of electrical stimulation. In vitro testing on mouse brain slices showed that they can record spontaneous oscillatory field potentials as well as single-unit action potentials and allow to safely deliver electrical stimulation for evoking field potentials. The combined superior electrical properties, durability and 3D microstructure topology of the PEDOT-CNF composite electrodes demonstrate outstanding potential for developing future neural surface interfacing applications.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the underlying structure of a gene regulatory network is crucial to understand the biological functions of genes or groups of genes. A common strategy to investigate it is to find community structure of these networks. However, methods of finding these communities are often sensitive to noise in the gene expression data and the inherent stochasticity of the community detection algorithms. Here we introduce an approach for identifying functional groups and their hierarchical organization in gene co-expression networks from expression data. A network describing the relatedness in the expression profiles of genes is first inferred using an information theoretic approach. Community structure within the inferred network is found by using modularity maximization. This community structure is further refined using three-body structural correlations to robustly identify important functional gene communities. We apply this approach to the expression data of Escherichia coli genes and identify 25 robust groups, many of which show key associations with important biological functions as demonstrated by Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis. Thus, our approach makes specific and novel predictions about the function of these genes.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (A{beta}) peptides, a major contributor to Alzheimers disease, occur in differing lengths, each of which forms a multitude of assembly types. The most toxic soluble oligomers are formed by A{beta}42; some of which have antiparallel {beta}-sheets. Previously, our group proposed molecular models of A{beta}42 hexamers in which the C-terminus third of the peptide (S3) forms an antiparallel 6-stranded {beta}-barrel that is surrounded by an antiparallel barrel formed by the more polar N-terminus (S1) and middle (S2) portions. These hexamers were proposed to act as seeds from which dodecamers, octadecamers, both smooth and beaded annular protofibrils, and transmembrane channels form. Since then, numerous aspects of our models have been supported by experimental findings. Recently, NMR-based structures have been proposed for A{beta}42 tetramers and octamers, and NMR studies have been reported for oligomers composed of ~ 32 monomers. Here we propose a range of concentric {beta}-barrel models and compare their dimensions to image-averaged electron micrographs of both beaded annular protofibrils (bAPFs) and smooth annular protofibrils (sAPFs) of A{beta}42. The smaller oligomers have 6, 8, 12, 16, and 18 monomers. These beads string together to form necklace-like bAPFs. These gradually morph into sAPFs in which a S3 {beta}-barrel is shielded on one or both sides by {beta}-barrels formed from S1 and S2 segments.",

    "abstract": "Adhesion induces dramatic morphological and mechanical changes to cells, which are reflected by changes to the actin cortex. Among the many different proteins involved in this sub-membranous layer, motor proteins (e.g., nonmuscle myosin II [NMII]) and actin nucleators (e.g., Arp2/3, formins) are known to have significant influences on its dynamics and structure. The different roles of NMII, Arp2/3, and formins in the dynamics, structure, and mechanics of the actin cortex depend on the adhesion state of the cell. In this study, we unravel the interplay between the dynamics, structure, and mechanics of the actin cortex in adhered cells and in cells in suspension. We show that treatments with extrinsic cellular perturbants lead to alterations of all three properties that are correlated. However, intrinsic actin cortex variations between different cell adhesion states lead to unexpected correlations. Surprisingly, we find that NMII minifilaments have a minor influence on the actin cortex. Using new microscopy techniques, we show that NMII minifilaments are not localized within the actin cortex, as previously thought, but concentrated in a layer beneath it. Our treatments affecting Arp2/3 and formin reveal correlations between the actin cortex characteristics. Our data build towards a comprehensive understanding of the actin cortex. This understanding allows the prediction and control of cortical changes, which is essential for the study of general cellular processes, such as cell migration, metastasis, and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "A major goal of molecular systems biology is to understand the coordinated function of genes or proteins in response to cellular signals and to understand these dynamics in the context of disease. Signaling pathway databases such as KEGG, NetPath, NCI-PID, and Panther describe the molecular interactions involved in different cellular responses. While the same pathway may be present in different databases, prior work has shown that the particular proteins and interactions differ across database annotations. However, to our knowledge no one has attempted to quantify their structural differences. It is important to characterize artifacts or other biases within pathway databases, which can provide a more informed interpretation for downstream analyses. In this work, we consider signaling pathways as graphs and we use topological measures to study their structure. We find that topological characterization using graphlets (small, connected subgraphs) distinguishes signaling pathways from appropriate null models of interaction networks. Next, we quantify topological similarity across pathway databases. Our analysis reveals that the pathways harbor database-specific characteristics implying that even though these databases describe the same pathways, they tend to be systematically different from one another. We show that pathway-specific topology can be uncovered after accounting for database-specific structure. This work present the first step towards elucidating common pathway structure beyond their specific database annotations.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical modeling has become a major tool to guide the characterization and synthetic construction of cellular processes. However, models typically lose their capacity to explain or predict experimental outcomes as soon as any, even minor, modification of the studied system or its operating conditions is implemented. This limits our capacity to fully comprehend the functioning of natural biological processes and is a major roadblock for the de novo design of complex synthetic circuits. Here, using a specifically constructed yeast optogenetic differentiation system as an example, we show that a simple deterministic model can explain system dynamics in given conditions but loses validity when modifications to the system are made. On the other hand, deploying theory from stochastic chemical kinetics and developing models of the systems components that simultaneously track single-cell and population processes allows us to quantitatively predict emerging dynamics of the system without any adjustment of model parameters. We conclude that carefully characterizing the dynamics of cell-to-cell variability using appropriate modeling theory may allow one to unravel the complex interplay of stochastic single-cell and population processes and to predict the functionality of composed synthetic circuits in growing populations before the circuit is constructed.",

    "abstract": "A critical bottleneck step towards understanding the immune activation and suppression mechanisms in tumor samples is to identify transcriptional signals underlying the cell-cell communication between tumor cells and immune/stromal cells in tumor microenvironments (TME). Cell-to-cell communication extensively relies on interactions between secreted ligands and cell-surface receptors, which create a highly connected signaling network through many ligand-receptor paths. The latest advance in in situ omics analyses, such as spatial transcriptomic (ST) analysis, provide unique opportunities to directly characterize ligand-receptor signaling networks that powers cell-cell communication, which has not been feasible based on either bulk or single-cell omics data. In this paper, we focus on high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC), and propose a novel statistical method, DAGBagST, to characterize the ligand-receptor interaction networks between adjacent tumor and stroma cells in ovarian tumors based on spatial transcriptomic data. DAGBagST utilizes a directed acyclic graph (DAG) model with a novel approach to handle the zero-inflated distribution observed in the ST data. It also leverages existing ligand-receptor regulation databases as prior information, and employs a bootstrap aggregation strategy to achieve robust network estimation. We applied DAGBagST to ST datasets of tumor samples from four HGSC patients, and identified common and distinct ligand-receptor regulations between adjacent tumor and stromal grids across multiple tumors. These results cast light on biological processes relating to the communication between tumor and TME cells in these ovarian tumors. An open-source R package for performing DAGBagST will be shared upon publication.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in neural interfaces enable the real-time and non-invasive tracking of motor neuron spiking activity. Such novel interfaces provide a promising basis for human motor augmentation by extracting potential high-dimensional control signals directly from the human nervous system. However, it is unclear how flexibly humans can control the activity of individual motor neurones to effectively increase the number of degrees-of-freedom available to coordinate multiple effectors simultaneously. Here, we provided human subjects (N=7) with real-time feedback on the discharge patterns of pairs of motor units (MUs) innervating a single muscle (tibialis anterior) and encouraged them to independently control the MUs by tracking targets in a 2D space. Subjects learned control strategies to achieve the target-tracking task for various combinations of MUs. These strategies rarely corresponded to a volitional control of independent input signals to individual MUs. Conversely, MU activation was consistent with a common input to the MU pair, while individual activation of the MUs in the pair was predominantly achieved by alterations in de-recruitment order that could be explained with history-dependent changes in motor neuron excitability. These results suggest that flexible MU control based on independent synaptic inputs to single MUs is not a simple to learn control strategy.",

We report here a data acquisition strategy that expands the detectable and quantifiable proteome in trace amounts of digests using CE-ESI-HRMS.

These nested experiments formed rungs of our \"DDA ladder.\" The method was tested for replicates analyzing ~500 pg of protein digest from cultured hippocampal (primary) neurons (mouse), which estimates to the total amount of protein from a single neuron. Analysis of net amounts approximating to ~10 neurons identified 428 nonredundant proteins (415 quantified), an ~35% increase over traditional DDA. The identified proteins were enriched in neuronal marker genes and molecular pathways of neurobiological importance. The DDA ladder deepens the detectable proteome from trace amounts of proteins, expanding the analytical toolbox of neuroscience.",

The molecular mechanism involved in these dietary effects of neurogenesis are unknown. This study investigated the effects of oleic and palmitic acids, which are abundant in a high-fat diet, on the hypothalamic neuronal transcriptome and how these changes impact neurogenesis events. The results show differential effects of low and high concentrations of oleic or palmitic acid treatment on differential gene transcription. Gene ontology analysis uncovered significant gene enrichment in several cellular pathways involved in gene regulation and protein production, particularly with proliferation, migration, and cell survival. The enriched signaling pathways include Wnt, integrin, PDGF, and apoptosis, in addition endocrine function signaling pathways CCKR and GnRH. Further examination of proliferation and migration show low concentrations of oleic acid to stimulate proliferation and high concentrations of both oleic and palmitic acid to stimulate apoptosis. Oleic acid also reduced hypothalamic neuronal migration, with little effects by palmitic acid. The results show direct impact of the two most abundant fatty acids in a high fat diet to directly impact hypothalamic neuronal proliferation and migration. The results also uncovered signaling pathways affected by oleic and palmitic acid and suggest a mechanism of prenatal high-fat diet induced neurogenesis events is through these two abundant fatty acids.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease and other dementias are associated with disruptions of electrophysiological brain activity, including low frequency and gamma rhythms. Many of these dementias are also associated with the malfunction of the membrane associated protein tau. Tauopathy disrupts neuronal function and the stability of synapses and is a key driver of neurodegeneration. Here we ask how brain rhythms are affected by tauopathy, at different stages of its progression. We performed local field potential recordings from visual cortex of rTg4510 and control animals at early stages of neurodegeneration (5 months) and at a more advanced stage where pathology is evident (8 months). We measured brain activity in the presence or absence of external visual stimulation, and while monitoring pupil diameter and locomotion to establish animal behavioural states. At 5 months, before substantial pathology, we found an increase in low frequency rhythms during resting state in tauopathic animals. This was because tauopathic animals entered intermittent periods of increased neural synchronisation, where activity across a wide band of low frequencies was strongly correlated. At 8 months, when the degeneration was more advanced, the increased synchronisation and low frequency power was accompanied by a reduction in power in the gamma range, with diverse effects across different components of the gamma rhythm. Our results indicate that slower rhythms are impaired earlier than gamma rhythms in tauopathy, suggesting that electrophysiological measurements can indicate both the presence and progression of tauopathic degeneration.",

The active structures are bound to CG and Gs heterotrimer, with one of the structure also containing the allosteric agonist, Org43553. The structures reveal a distinct  push and pull\" mechanism of receptor activation, in which the ECD is pushed by the bound hormone and pulled by the extended hinge loop next to the transmembrane domain (TMD). A highly conserved 10-residue fragment (P10) from the hinge C-terminal loop at the ECD-TMD interface functions as a tethered agonist to induce conformational changes in TMD and G-protein coupling. Org43553 binds to a TMD pocket and interacts directly with P10 that further stabilizes the receptor in the active conformation.

    "abstract": "The medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) is a progenitor domain in the subpallium that produces both locally-projecting interneurons which undergo tangential migration in structures such as the cortex as well as long-range projection neurons that occupy subcortical nuclei. Very little is known about the transcriptional mechanisms specifying the migratory behavior and axonal projection patterns of these two broad classes of MGE-derived neurons. In this study, we identify St18 as a novel transcriptional determinant specifying projection neuron fate in the MGE lineage. St18 is transiently expressed in the MGE subventricular zone (SVZ) and mantle, and we assessed its function using an ES cell-based model of MGE development. Induction of St18 is sufficient to direct ES-derived MGE neurons to adopt a projection neuron-like identity as defined by migration and morphology. Using genetic loss-of-function in mice, we find that St18 is required for the production of globus pallidus pars externa (GPe) prototypic projection neurons. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed that St18 regulates MGE output of specific neuronal populations: in the absence of St18, we observe a large expansion of cortical interneurons at the expense of putative GPe neurons. Through gene expression analysis we identified a downstream effector of St18, Cbx7, which is a component of Polycomb repressor complex 1. We find that Cbx7 is essential for projection neuron-like migration and is not involved in St18-mediated projection neuron-like morphology. Our results characterize a novel transcriptional determinant that directs GPe prototypic projection neuron identity. Further, we identified a downstream target of St18, Cbx7, which regulates only the migratory behavior of long-range projection neurons, suggesting that specific features of MGE projection neuron identity may be governed in a compartmentalized fashion by distinct transcriptional modules downstream of St18.",

    "abstract": "During animal embryogenesis, homeostasis and disease, tissues push and pull on their surroundings to move forward. Although the force-generating machinery is known, it is unknown how tissues exert physical stresses on their substrate to generate motion in vivo. Here, we identify the force transmission machinery, the substrate, and the stresses that a tissue, the zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium, generates during its migration. We find that the primordium couples actin flow through integrins to the basement membrane for forward movement. Talin/integrin-mediated coupling is required for efficient migration and its loss is partly compensated for by increased actin flow. Using Embryogram, an approach to measure stresses in vivo, we show that the primordiums rear exerts high stresses, indicating that this tissue pushes itself forward with its back. This unexpected strategy likely also underlies the motion of other tissues in animals",

    "abstract": "Mutation accumulation (MA) experiments, in which de novo mutations are sampled and subsequently characterized, are an essential tool in understanding the processes underlying evolution. In microbial populations, MA protocols typically involve a period of population growth between severe bottlenecks, such that a single individual can form a visible colony. While it has long been appreciated that the action of positive selection during this growth phase cannot be eliminated, it is typically assumed to be negligible. Here, we quantify the effect of both positive and negative selection in MA studies, demonstrating that selective effects can substantially bias the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) and mutation rates estimated from typical MA protocols in microbes. We then present a simple correction for this bias which applies to both beneficial and deleterious mutations, and can be used to correct the observed DFE in multiple environments. Finally, we use simulated MA experiments to illustrate the extent to which the MA-inferred DFE differs from the underlying true DFE, and demonstrate that the proposed correction accurately reconstructs the true DFE over a wide range of scenarios. These results highlight that positive selection during microbial MA experiments is in fact not negligible, but can be corrected to gain a more accurate understanding of fundamental evolutionary parameters.",

We also found SNPs connected to pigmentation, cholesterol, sleep, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI) to show signals of selection following the post Neolithic admixture events. We recapitulate existing knowledge about pigmentation traits, corroborate the connection between Steppe ancestry and height and highlight novel associations. Among others, we report the contribution of Hunter Gatherer ancestry towards high BMI and low blood cholesterol levels.\n\nOur results show that the ancient components that form the contemporary European genome were differentiated enough to contribute ancestry-specific signatures to the phenotypic variability displayed by contemporary individuals in at least 11 out of 27 of the complex traits investigated here.",

    "abstract": "One of the very first observations made regarding alpha oscillations (8-14 Hz), is that they increase in power over posterior areas when awake participants close their eyes. Recent work, especially in the context of (spatial) attention, suggests that alpha activity reflects a mechanism of functional inhibition. However, it remains unclear how eye closure impacts anticipatory alpha modulation observed in attention paradigms, and how this affects subsequent behavioral performance. Here, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 33 human participants performing a tactile discrimination task with their eyes open vs. closed. We replicated the hallmarks of previous somatosensory spatial attention studies: alpha lateralization across the somatosensory cortices as well as alpha increase over posterior regions. Furthermore, we found that eye closure leads to (i) reduced task performance, (ii) widespread increase in alpha power, and (iii) reduced anticipatory visual alpha modulation (iv) with no effect on somatosensory alpha lateralization. Regardless of whether participants had their eyes open or closed, increased posterior alpha power and somatosensory alpha lateralization improved their performance. Thus, we provide evidence that eye closure does not alter the impact of anticipatory alpha modulations on behavioral performance. We propose there is an optimal posterior alpha level for somatosensory task performance, which can be achieved through a combination of eye closure and top-down anticipatory attention.\n\nSignificance StatementAlpha oscillations are dominant when awake participants have their eyes closed. Furthermore, alpha is known to modulate with anticipatory attention, and has been ascribed a role of active functional inhibition. Surprisingly, the link between anticipatory alpha and eye closure remains unclear. Here we collected MEG data while human participants performed a tactile discrimination task either with their eyes open or closed. Eye closure led to a widespread increase in alpha power, and affected anticipatory visual alpha modulation but not somatosensory alpha lateralization. Importantly, eye closure did not affect the correlation between alpha and task performance. Our findings provide novel insights into how eye closure impacts anticipatory alpha modulation, and how optimal alpha levels for task performance can be achieved differently.",

    "abstract": "Falls are common in daily life, often caused by trips and slips and, particularly in older adults, with serious consequences. Although arm movements play an important role in balance control, there is limited research into the role of arm movements during balance recovery after tripping in older adults. We investigated how older adults use their arms to recover from a trip and the difference in the effects of arm movements between fallers (n=5) and non-fallers (n=11).\n\nSixteen older males and females (69.7{+/-}2.3 years) walked along a walkway and were occasionally tripped over suddenly appearing obstacles. We analysed the first trip using a biomechanical model based on full-body kinematics and force-plate data to calculate whole body orientation during the trip and recovery phase. With this model, we simulated the effects of arm movements at foot-obstacle impact and during trip recovery on body orientation.\n\nApart from an increase in sagittal plane forward body rotation at touchdown in fallers, we found no significant differences between fallers and non-fallers in the effects of arm movements on trip recovery. Like earlier studies in young adults, we found that arm movements during the recovery phase had most favourable effects in the transverse plane: by delaying the transfer of angular momentum of the arms to the body, older adults rotated the tripped side more forward thereby allowing for a larger recovery step. Older adults that are prone to falling might improve their balance recovery after tripping by learning to prolong ongoing arm movements.",

    "abstract": "A grand challenge of analytical chemistry is the identification of unknown molecules based on tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra. Current metabolite annotation approaches are often manual or partially automated, and commonly rely on a spectral database to search from or train machine learning classifiers on. Unfortunately, spectral databases are often instrument specific and incomplete due to the limited availability of compound standards or a molecular database, which limits the ability of methods utilizing them to predict novel molecule structures. We describe a generative modeling approach that can leverage the vast amount of unpaired and/or unlabeled molecule structures and MS/MS spectra to learn general rules for synthesizing molecule structures and MS/MS spectra. The approach is based on recent work using semi-supervised deep variational autoencoders to learn joint latent representations of multiple and complex modalities. We show that adding molecule structures with no spectra to the training set improves the prediction quality on spectra from a structure disjoint dataset of new molecules, which is not possible using bi-modal supervised approaches. The described methodology provides a demonstration and framework for how recent advances in semi-supervised machine learning can be applied to overcome bottlenecks in missing annotations and noisy data to tackle unaddressed problems in the life sciences where large volumes of data are available.",

Thus, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms of maturation in vivo. However, it is unknown if there are genes and pathways conserved across organs during maturation. To address this, we performed a time-series analysis of the transcriptome of the mouse heart, brain, liver, and kidney and analyzed their trajectories over time. In addition, gene regulatory networks were reconstructed to determine overlapping expression patterns. Based on these, we identified commonly upregulated and downregulated pathways across all four organs. Key upstream regulators were also predicted based on the temporal expression of downstream genes. These findings suggest the presence of universal regulators during organ maturation, which may help us develop a general strategy to mature stem cell-derived cells in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic analyses are widely used in microbiological research, for example to trace the progression of bacterial outbreaks based on whole-genome sequencing data. In practice, multiple analysis steps such as de novo assembly, alignment and phylogenetic inference are combined to form phylogenetic workflows. Comprehensive benchmarking of the accuracy of complete phylogenetic workflows is lacking.\n\nTo benchmark different phylogenetic workflows, we simulated bacterial evolution under a wide range of evolutionary models, varying the relative rates of substitution, insertion, deletion, gene duplication, gene loss and lateral gene transfer events. The generated datasets corresponded to a genetic diversity usually observed within bacterial species ([&ge;]95% average nucleotide identity). We replicated each simulation three times to assess replicability. In total, we benchmarked seventeen distinct phylogenetic workflows using 8 different simulated datasets.\n\nWe found that recently developed k-mer alignment methods such as kSNP and SKA achieve similar accuracy as reference mapping. The high accuracy of k-mer alignment methods can be explained by the large fractions of genomes these methods can align, relative to other approaches. We also found that the choice of de novo assembly algorithm influences the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstruction, with workflows employing SPAdes or SKESA outperforming those employing Velvet. Finally, we found that the results of phylogenetic benchmarking are highly variable between replicates.\n\nWe conclude that for phylogenomic reconstruction k-mer alignment methods are relevant alternatives to reference mapping at species level, especially in the absence of suitable reference genomes. We show de novo genome assembly accuracy to be an underappreciated parameter required for accurate phylogenomic reconstruction.\n\nImpact statementPhylogenetic analyses are crucial to understand the evolution and spread of microbes. Among their many applications is the reconstruction of transmission events which can provide information on the progression of pathogen outbreaks. For example, to investigate foodborne outbreaks such as the 2011 outbreak of Escherichia coli O104:H4 across Europe. As different microbes evolve differently, it is important to know which phylogenetic workflows are most accurate when working with diverse bacterial data. However, benchmarks usually consider only a limited dataset. We therefore employed a range of simulated evolutionary scenarios and benchmarked seventeen phylogenetic workflows on these simulated datasets. An advantage of our simulation approach is that we know a priori what the outcome of the analyses should be, allowing us to benchmark accuracy. We found significant differences between phylogenetic workflows and were able to dissect which factors contribute to phylogenetic analysis accuracy. Taken together, this new information will hopefully enable more accurate phylogenetic analysis of bacterial outbreaks.\n\nData summaryA Zenodo repository is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5036179 containing all simulated genomes, all alignments produced by phylogenetic workflows and .csv files summarising the topological accuracies of phylogenies produced based on these alignments.

Unlike proteins, glycans do not typically adopt specific secondary structures and remain very mobile, influencing protein dynamics and interactions with other molecules. Glycan conformational freedom impairs complete structural elucidation of glycoproteins. Computer simulations may be used to model glycan structure and dynamics. However, such simulations typically require thousands of computing hours on specialized supercomputers, thus limiting routine use. Here, we describe a reductionist method that can be implemented on personal computers to graft ensembles of realistic glycan conformers onto static protein structures in a matter of minutes. Using this open-source pipeline, we reconstructed the full glycan cover of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) and a human GABAA receptor. Focusing on S-protein, we show that GlycoSHIELD recapitulates key features of extended simulations of the glycosylated protein, including epitope masking, and provides new mechanistic insights on N-glycan impact on protein structural dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Towards the end of 2020, multiple variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs) have arisen from the original SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. Mutations in the Spike protein are highly scrutinized for their impact on transmissibility, pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy. Here, we contribute to the growing body of literature on emerging variants by evaluating the impact of single mutations on the overall antigenicity of selected variants and their binding to the ACE2 receptor. We observe a differential contribution of single mutants to the global variants phenotype related to ACE2 interaction and antigenicity. Using biolayer interferometry, we observe that enhanced ACE2 interaction is mostly modulated by a decrease in off-rate. Finally, we made the interesting observation that the Spikes from tested emerging variants bind better to ACE2 at 37{degrees}C compared to the D614G variant. Whether improved ACE2 binding at higher temperature facilitates emerging variants transmission remain to be demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Natural transformation plays a major role in the spreading of antibiotic resistances and virulence factors. Whilst bacterial species display specificities in the molecular machineries allowing transforming DNA capture and integration into their genome, the ComF(C) protein is essential for natural transformation in all Gram-positive and - negative species studied. Despite this, its role remains largely unknown. Here, we show that Helicobacter pylori ComF is not only involved in DNA transport through the cell membrane, but it also required for the handling of the ssDNA once it is delivered into the cytoplasm. ComF crystal structure revealed the presence of a zinc-finger motif and a putative phosphoribosyl transferase domain, both necessary for its in vivo activity. ComF is a membrane-associated protein with affinity for single-stranded DNA. Collectively, our results suggest that ComF provides the link between the transport of the transforming DNA into the cytoplasm and its handling by the recombination machinery.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder typically characterized by insoluble inclusions of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43. The mechanisms underlying toxic TDP-43 accumulation are not understood. Persistent activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is implicated in ALS. However, it is unclear how p38 MAPK affects TDP-43 proteinopathy. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of p38 MAPK reduces pathological TDP-43 phosphorylation, aggregation, cytoplasmic mislocalization, and neurotoxicity. We establish that p38 MAPK phosphorylates TDP-43 at pathological serine 409/410 (S409/S410) and serine 292 (S292), which reduces TDP-43 liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) but allows pathological TDP-43 aggregation. Moreover, we show that protein arginine methyltransferase 1 methylates TDP-43 at R293. Importantly, S292 phosphorylation reduces R293 methylation, and R293 methylation reduces S409/S410 phosphorylation. R293 methylation permits TDP-43 LLPS and reduces pathological TDP-43 aggregation. Thus, strategies to reduce p38-mediated TDP-43 phosphorylation and promote R293 methylation could have therapeutic utility for ALS and related TDP-43 proteinopathies.",

    "abstract": "Anopheles fluviatilis sensu lato, a primary malaria vector in India, was identified to be comprised of four cryptic species, provisionally designated as species S, T, U and V. However, Kumar et al. (Mol Ecol Resour, 2013;13:354-61) considered all of the then known three members of this species complex (S, T and U) conspecific. The specific status of species S and T was refuted based on the lack of sufficient barcode gap in mitochondrial-CO1 and the perceived presence of heterozygotes in populations as detected through one of the two species-specific PCR assays employed for the cryptic species identification. The existence of species U was refuted claiming that earlier investigations have already refuted their existence. This conclusion is concerning because of the differential public health implications of members of the Fluviatilis Complex. Here we discuss problems associated with the CO1-based barcode approach for delimitation of cryptic species, the perceived heterozygosity between species S and T based on a species-specific PCR assay, and interpretation of published reports. We demonstrated that fixed differences do exist in the ITS2-rDNA sequence of species S and T with no evidence of heterozygotes in sympatric populations and, that the observed heterozygosity by Kumar et al. in the ITS2-based species diagnostic PCR is due to the high mispriming tendency of the T-specific primer with species S. We infer that mitochondrial DNA-based  barcoding gap, an arbitrary threshold recommended for species delimitation, alone, is inadequate to delimit the members of An. fluviatilis complex.",

    "abstract": "The lung epithelium forms the first barrier against respiratory pathogens and noxious chemicals; however, little is known about how >90% of this barrier - made of alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells - responds to injury, in contrast to our accumulating knowledge of epithelial progenitor and stem cells whose importance lies in their ability to restore the barrier. Using Sendai virus to model natural infection in mice, we combine 3D imaging, lineage-tracing, and single-cell genomics to show that AT1 cells have an intermediary role by persisting in areas depleted of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, mounting an interferon response, and receding from invading airway cells. Sendai virus infection mobilizes airway cells to form alveolar SOX2+ clusters without differentiating into AT1 or AT2 cells, as shown in influenza models. Intriguingly, large AT2-cell-depleted areas remain covered by AT1 cells, which we name \"AT2-less regions\", and are replaced by SOX2+ clusters spreading both basally and luminally around AT1 cell extensions. AT2 cell proliferation and differentiation are largely confined to topologically distal regions - the end of airspace that could be in the periphery or middle of the lung - and form de novo alveolar surface, with limited contribution to in situ repair of AT2-less regions. Time course single-cell RNA-seq and AT1-cell interactome analyses suggest enhanced recognition of AT1 cells by immune cells and altered growth signals. Our comprehensive spatiotemporal and genome-wide study highlights the hitherto unappreciated role of AT1 cells during Sendai virus infection and possibly other injury-repair processes.",

The phosphoinositide PI5P interacts with two distant flexible linker regions of UHRF1 in a mode that is dependent on the polar head group and the acyl part of the phospholipid. The associated conformational rearrangements stably position the H3unmodified and H3K9me3 histone recognition modules of UHRF1 for multivalent and synergistic binding of the H3 tail.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe 31st of December 2019 was when the World Health Organization received a report about an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The outbreak was the result of the novel virus labeled as SARS-CoV-2, which spread to about 220 countries and caused approximately 3,311,780 deaths, infecting more than 159,319,384 people by May 12th, of 2021. The virus caused a worldwide pandemic leading to panic, quarantines, and lockdowns - although none of its predecessors from the coronavirus family have ever achieved such a scale. The key to understanding the global success of SARS-CoV-2 is hidden in its genome.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe retrieved data for 329,942 SARS-CoV-2 records uploaded to the GISAID database from the beginning of the pandemic until the 8th of January 2021. To process the data, a Python variant detection script was developed, using pairwise2 from the BioPython library. Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, were applied to visualize the data. Genomic coordinates were obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/). Sequence alignments were performed for every gene separately. Genomes less than 26,000 nucleotides long were excluded from the research. Clustering was performed using HDBScan.\n\nResultsHere, we addressed the genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 using 329,942 worldwide samples. The analysis yielded 155 genome variations (SNPs and deletions) in more than 0.3% of the sequences. Nine common SNPs were present in more than 20% of the samples. Clustering results suggested that a proportion of people (2.46%) were infected with a distinct subtype of the B.1.1.7 variant. The subtype may be characterized by four to six additional mutations, with four being a more frequent option (G28881A, G28882A, and G28883[C] in the N gene, A23403G in S, A28095T in ORF8, G25437T in ORF3a). Two clusters were formed by mutations in the samples uploaded predominantly by Denmark and Australia, which may indicate the emergence of \"Danish\" and \"Australian\" variants. Five clusters were linked to increased/decreased age, shifted gender ratio, or both. According to a correlation coefficient matrix, 69 mutations correlate with at least one other mutation (correlation coefficient greater than 0.7). We also addressed the completeness of the GISAID database, where between 77% and 93% of the fields were either left blank or filled incorrectly. Metadata mining analysis has led to a hypothesis about gender inequality in medical care in certain countries. Finally, we found ORF6 and E as the most conserved genes (96.15% and 94.66% of the sequences totally match the reference, respectively), making them potential targets for vaccines and treatment. Our results indicate areas of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that researchers can focus on for further structural and functional analysis.",

    "abstract": "Nanobodies (Nbs) have recently emerged as a promising class of antibody fragments for biomedical and therapeutic applications. Despite having marked physicochemical properties, Nbs are derived from camelids and may require \"humanization\" to improve translational potentials for clinical trials. Here we have systematically analyzed the sequence and structural properties of Nbs based on NGS (next-generation sequencing) databases and high-resolution structures. Our analysis reveals substantial framework diversities and underscores the key differences between Nbs and human Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. We identified conserved residues that may contribute to enhanced solubility, structural stability, and antigen-binding, providing insights into Nb humanization. Based on big data analysis, we developed \"Llamanade, a user-friendly, open-source to facilitate rational humanization of Nbs. Using Nb sequence as input, Llamanade provides information on the sequence features, model structures, and optimizes solutions to humanize Nbs. The full analysis for a given Nb takes less than a minute on a local computer. To demonstrate the robustness of this tool, we applied it to successfully humanize a cohort of structurally diverse and highly potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Nbs. Llamanade is freely available and will be easily accessible on a web server to support the development of a rapidly expanding repertoire of therapeutic Nbs into safe and effective trials.\n\nAuthor SummaryCamelid Nbs are characterized by small size, excellent pharmacological properties and high flexibility in bioengineering for therapeutic development. However, Nbs are \"xeno\" antibodies, which require \"humanization\" to improve their translational potential. Currently, there is a lack of systematic investigation of Nbs to rationally guide humanization. No dedicated software has been developed for this purpose. Here, we report the development of Llamanade, an open-source computational pipeline and the first dedicated software to facilitate rational humanization of Nbs.\n\nTo subjectively evaluate Llamanade, we used it to humanize a cohort of structurally diverse and ultrapotent antiviral Nbs against SARS-CoV-2. Robust humanization by Llamanade significantly improved the humanness level of Nbs to closely resemble fully human IgGs. Importantly, these highly humanized antiviral Nbs remained excellent solubility and comparably high bioactivities to the non-humanized Nb precursors. We envision that Llamanade will help advance Nb research into therapeutic development.",

Recently, it has been found that both conformations coexist in a dynamical equilibrium and that several biological functions require HG pairs. This relevance has motivated experimental and computational investigations of the base-pairing transition. However, a systematic simulation of sequence variations has remained out of reach. Here, we employ advanced path-based methods to perform unprecedented free-energy calculations. Our methodology enables us to study the different mechanisms of purine rotation, either remaining inside or after flipping outside of the double helix. We study seven different sequences, which are neighbor variations of a well-studied A{middle dot}T pair in A6-DNA. We observe the known effect of A{middle dot}T steps favoring HG stability, and find evidence of triple-hydrogen-bonded neighbors hindering the inside transition. More importantly, we identify a dominant factor: the direction of the A rotation, with the 6-ring pointing either towards the longer or shorter segment of the chain, respectively relating to a lower or higher barrier. This highlights the role of DNAs relative flexibility as a modulator of the WCF/HG dynamic equilibrium. Additionally, we provide a robust methodology for future HG proclivity studies.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 is a ribonucleoprotein complex that sequence-specifically binds and cleaves double-stranded DNA. Wildtype Cas9 as well as its nickase and cleavage-incompetent mutants have been used in various biological techniques due to their versatility and programmable specificity. Cas9 has been shown to bind very stably to DNA even after cleavage of the individual DNA strands, inhibiting further turnovers and considerably slowing down in-vivo repair processes. This poses an obstacle in genome editing applications. Here, we employed single-molecule magnetic tweezers to investigate the binding stability of different S. pyogenes Cas9 variants after cleavage by challenging them with supercoiling. We find that different release mechanisms occur depending on which DNA strand is cleaved. After non-target strand cleavage, supercoils are immediately but slowly released by swiveling of the non-target strand around the DNA with friction. Consequently, Cas9 and its non-target strand nicking mutant stay stably bound to the DNA for many hours even at elevated torsional stress. After target-strand cleavage, supercoils are only removed after the collapse of the R-loop. We identified several states with different stabilities of the R-loop. Most importantly, we find that the post-cleavage state of Cas9 exhibits a higher stability compared to the pre-cleavage state. This suggests that Cas9 has evolved to remain tightly bound to its cut target.",

We have previously identified an additional  partially open conformation using Luminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (LRET) experiments. Here, a combination of LRET and the molecular docking program HADDOCK was used to further investigate this partially open state and identify three conformations of ATP-bound MR in solution: closed, partially open, and open, which are in addition to the extended, apo conformation. These models are supported with mutagenesis and SAXS data that corroborate the presence of these three states and suggest a mechanism for the processivity of the MR complex along the DNA.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe proto-oncogene BCL-3 is upregulated in a subset of colorectal cancers (CRC) and increased expression of the gene correlates with poor patient prognosis. The aim is to investigate whether inhibiting BCL-3 can increase the response to DNA damage in CRC.\n\nDesignThe function of BCL-3 in DNA damage response was studied in vitro using siRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and in vivo using Bcl3-/- mice. DNA damage induced by {gamma}-irradiation and/or cisplatin was quantified using H2AX and RAD51 foci, repair pathways investigated using HR/NHEJ assays and treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib.\n\nResultSuppression of BCL-3 increases double strand break number and decreases homologous recombination in CRC cells, supported by reduced RAD51 foci number and increased sensitivity to PARP inhibition. Importantly, a similar phenotype is seen in Bcl3-/- mice, where the intestinal crypts of these mice exhibit sensitivity to DNA damage and a greater number of double strand breaks compared to wild type mice. Furthermore Apc.Krasmutant x Bcl3-/- mice exhibit increased DNA damage and reduced RAD51+ cells compared to their wild type counterparts when treated with cisplatin.\n\nConclusionThis work identifies BCL-3 as a regulator of the cellular response to DNA damage and suggests that elevated BCL-3 expression could increase resistance of tumour cells to DNA damaging agents including radiotherapy. These findings offer a rationale for targeting BCL-3 in CRC as an adjuvant to conventional therapies and suggest that BCL-3 expression in tumours could be a useful biomarker in stratification of rectal cancer patients for neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Integrative analysis was performed in the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas and The Cancer Genome Atlas to describe the pyroptosis-associated molecular classification and prognostic signature in glioma. Pyroptosis-related genes were used for consensus clustering and to develop a prognostic signature. The immune statuses, molecular alterations and clinical features of differentially expressed genes were analyzed among different subclasses and risk groups. A lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was built, and drug sensitivity analysis was used to identify small molecular drugs for the identified genes. Glioma can be divided into two subclasses using 30 pyroptosis-related genes. Cluster 1 displayed high immune signatures and poor prognosis as well as high immune-related function scores. A prognostic signature based on 15 pyroptosis-related genes of the CGGA cohort can predict the overall survival of glioma and was well validated in the TCGA cohort. Cluster 1 had higher risk scores. The high-risk group had high immune cell and function scores and low DNA methylation of pyroptosis-related genes. The differences in pyroptosis-related gene mutations and somatic copy numbers were significant between the high-risk and low-risk groups. The ceRNA regulatory network uncovered the regulatory patterns of different risk groups in glioma. Nine pairs of target genes and drugs were identified. In vitro, CASP8 promotes the progression of glioma cells. Pyroptosis-related genes can reflect the molecular biological and clinical features of glioma subclasses. The established prognostic signature can predict prognosis and distinguish molecular alterations in glioma patients. Our comprehensive analyses provide valuable guidelines for improving glioma patient management and individualized therapy.",

These regulatory elements include cryptic and intragenic promoters which may constitute up to a third of predicted Escherichia coli promoters.

Rational engineering can be used to alter key promoter element nucleotides interacting with {sigma} factors and eliminate downstream transcriptional activity.

Nonetheless, despite the many molecular tools and resources that have been developed, there are challenges for its successful engineering, in particular to obtain reproducible and high levels of transgene expression. Here we describe a synthetic biology approach to screen several hundred independent transformants using standardised parts to explore different parameters that might affect transgene expression. We focused on terminators and, using a standardised workflow and quantitative outputs, tested 9 different elements representing three different size classes of native terminators to determine their ability to support high level expression of a GFP reporter gene. We found that the optimal size reflected the median size of element found in the C. reinhardtii genome. The behaviour of the terminator parts was similar with different promoters, in different host strains and with different transgenes. This approach is applicable to the systematic testing of other genetic elements, facilitating comparison to determine optimal transgene design.",

    "abstract": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe respiratory illness in children and the elderly. Treatments for RSV disease are however limited and efforts to produce an effective vaccine have so far been unsuccessful. Understanding RSV virion structure is an important prerequisite for developing interventions to treat or prevent infection but has been challenging because of the fragility of virions propagated in cell culture. Here we show, using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) and cryogenic electron tomography (cryoET) of RSV particles cultivated directly on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grids, that there is extensive helical symmetry in RSV filamentous virions. We have calculated a 16 [A] resolution three-dimensional reconstruction of the viral envelope, targeting the matrix protein (M) that forms an endoskeleton below the viral membrane. These data define a helical lattice of M proteins, showing how M is oriented relative to the viral envelope and that helical ordering of viral glycoproteins that stud the viral envelope is coordinated by the M layer. Moreover, the helically ordered viral glycoproteins in RSV filamentous virions cluster in pairs, which may have implications for the conformation of fusion (F) glycoprotein epitopes that are the principal target for vaccine and monoclonal antibody development. We also report the presence, in authentic virus infections, of N-RNA rings packaged within RSV filamentous virions. Overall, the structural data obtained provides molecular insight into the organization of the virion and the mechanism of its assembly.",

However, the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-C. albicans co-infection remains elusive. In the current study, we utilise a mouse model to demonstrate that Mtb promotes macrophage environment conducive for C. albicans survival. Mtb-dependent PKC{zeta}-WNT signalling axis induces expression of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, COP1. A secondary infection of C. albicans in such Mtb-infected macrophages causes COP1 to mediate the proteasomal degradation of IRF9, a cardinal factor that we identified to arbitrate an inflammatory programmed cell death, pyroptosis. In vivo experiments mimicking a preexisting Mtb infection demonstrate that inhibition of pyroptosis in mice results in increased C. albicans burden and aberrant lung tissue architecture, leading to increased host mortality. Together, our study reveals the crucial role of pyroptosis regulation for manifesting a successful C. albicans-Mtb co-infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is caused by accumulation of excess lipids in hepatocytes. Genome wide association studies have identified strong association of NAFLD with non-synonymous E167K amino acid mutation in transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2) protein. The E167K mutation affects TM6SF2 stability and its carriers display increased hepatic lipids levels and lower serum triglycerides. While similar phenotype is evident in mice with TM6SF2 knockdown, effects of TM6SF2 on hepatic lipid metabolism is not completely understood.\n\nMethodsHere, we overexpressed wild-type or E167K variant of TM6SF2 or knocked down TM6SF2 expression in lipid-treated Huh-7 cells and used biochemical assays, untargeted lipidomic analysis, RNAseq transcriptome analysis and high-throughput fluorescent imaging to determine changes in lipid metabolism.\n\nResultsBoth knockdown and E167K overexpression increased acylglyceride levels which was decreased by wild-type TM6SF2 overexpression. Further, mean intensity of individual lipid droplets was increased by E167K overexpression and knockdown while wild-type TM6SF2 had no effects. We also observed lipid chain remodeling for acylglycerides by TM6SF2 knockdown leading to a relative increase in species with shorter and more saturated side chains. RNA sequencing revealed differential expression of several lipid metabolizing genes, including genes belonging to AKR1 family and lipases, primarily in cells with TM6SF2 knockdown.\n\nConclusionTaken together, our data shows that overexpression of TM6SF2 gene or its loss-of-function changes hepatic lipid species composition and expression of lipid metabolizing genes. Further, overexpression of E167K variant and TM6SF2 knockdown similarly increased hepatic lipid accumulation and lipid droplets profile further confirming a loss-of-function effect for variant.",

In Plasmodium berghei the transcription factor AP2-G is required and sufficient for this switch, but how a particular sex is determined in a haploid parasite remains unknown. Using a global screen of barcoded mutants, we here identify ten genes essential for the formation of either male or female sexual forms and validate their importance for transmission. High-resolution single-cell transcriptomics of wild-type and mutant parasites portrays the developmental bifurcation and reveals a regulatory cascade of putative gene functions in determination and subsequent differentiation of each sex.

The origin and identity of the membranes that form the autophagosome remain to be fully characterized. Here, we investigated the role of cholesterol in starvation- induced autophagy and identify a role for the ER-localized cholesterol transport protein GRAMD1C in the regulation of autophagy and mitochondrial function. We demonstrate that cholesterol depletion leads to a rapid induction of autophagy, possibly caused by a corresponding increased abundance of curved autophagy membranes. We further show that GRAMD1C is a negative regulator of starvation-induced autophagy. Similar to its yeast orthologue, GRAMD1C is recruited to mitochondria through its GRAM domain. Additionally, we find that GRAMD1C depletion leads to increased mitochondrial cholesterol accumulation and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, we demonstrate that expression of GRAM family genes is linked to clear cell renal carcinoma survival, highlighting the pathophysiological relevance of cholesterol transport proteins.",

We have previously discovered that antibiotic disruption of the gut microbiota decreases intestinal IL-33 and IL-25 and increases susceptibility to CDI. We further found that IL-33 promotes protection through type 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC2s), which produce IL-13. However, the contribution of IL-13 to disease has never been explored. We found that administration of IL-13 protected, and anti-IL-13 exacerbated CDI as measured by weight loss and clinical score, particularly during disease resolution. Additionally, concordant with IL-13 being important for M2 macrophage polarization, we saw a decrease in M2 macrophages (CD11B+CD64+CD206+) cells following neutralization of IL-13. We also observed monocyte accumulation as early as day three post-infection following IL-13 neutralization, suggesting IL-13 may be directly or indirectly important for their recruitment or transition into macrophages. Neutralization of the decoy receptor IL-13R2 resulted in protection from disease, likely through increased available endogenous IL-13. Our data highlight the protective role of IL-13 in promoting recovery from CDI and the association of poor responses with a dysregulated monocytemacrophage compartment. These results increase our understanding of type 2 immunity in CDI and may have implications for treating disease in patients.",

    "abstract": "Arthropod-borne viral (arboviral) pathogens comprise a significant global disease burden, and outbreaks are expected to increase as vectors expand. Surveillance and mitigation of arboviruses like Zika virus (ZIKV) require accurate estimates of transmissibility by vector mosquitoes. While numerous laboratory vector competence experiments show that Aedes spp. mosquitoes are competent ZIKV vectors, differences in experimental protocols prevent direct comparisons of relative transmissibility across studies. An understudied factor complicating these comparisons is differential environmental microbiota exposures, where most vector competence studies use mosquitoes reared in laboratory tap water, which does not represent the microbial complexity of environmental water where wild larvae develop. We simulated natural larval development by rearing Californian Aedes aegypti with microbes obtained from cemetery headstone water, a common larval habitat in California, compared to conventional laboratory tap water. Ae. aegypti larvae reared in environmental cemetery water pupated 3 days faster and at higher rates. Female adult mosquitoes reared in environmental water were less competent vectors of ZIKV compared to laboratory water-reared Ae. aegypti, as evidenced by significantly reduced infection and transmission rates for two 2015 ZIKV strains and in two Ae. aegypti colonies from California. Microbiome comparisons of laboratory- and environment-water reared mosquitoes as well as their rearing water showed significantly higher bacterial diversity in environment water; despite this pattern, corresponding differences in diversity were not consistently detected in adult mosquitoes reared in different water sources. We also detected more significant associations between the microbial composition of adult mosquitoes and whether they ingested a bloodmeal than larval water type. Together, these results highlight the role of transient microbes in the larval environment in modulating vector competence. Laboratory vector competence likely overestimates true transmissibility of arboviruses like ZIKV when conventional laboratory water is used for rearing.\n\nImportanceWe observed that Ae. aegypti mosquitoes reared in water from cemetery headstones instead of the laboratory tap exhibited a reduced capacity to become infected with and transmit Zika virus. Water from the environment contained more bacterial species than tap water, but these bacteria were not consistently detected in adult mosquitoes. Our results suggest that rearing mosquito larvae in water collected from local environments as opposed to laboratory tap water, as is conventional, provides a more realistic assessment of vector competence since it better recapitulates the natural environment in which larvae develop. Given that laboratory vector competence is used to define the species to target for control, use of environmental water to rear larvae could better approximate the microbial exposures of wild mosquitoes, lessening the potential for overestimating transmission risk.",

    "abstract": "New high-throughput biochemistry techniques complement selection-based approaches and provide quantitative kinetic and thermodynamic data for thousands of protein variants in parallel. With these advances, library generation rather than data collection has become rate limiting. Unlike pooled selection approaches, high-throughput biochemistry requires mutant libraries in which individual sequences are rationally designed, efficiently recovered, sequence-validated, and separated from one another, but current strategies are unable to produce these libraries at the needed scale and specificity at reasonable cost. Here, we present a scalable, rapid, and inexpensive approach for creating User-designed Physically Isolated Clonal-Mutant (uPIC-M) libraries that utilizes recent advances in oligo synthesis, high-throughput sample preparation, and next-generation sequencing. To demonstrate uPIC-M, we created a scanning mutant library of SpAP, a 541 amino acid alkaline phosphatase, and recovered 94% of desired mutants in a single iteration. uPIC-M uses commonly available equipment and freely downloadable custom software and can produce a 5000 mutant library at 1/3 the cost and 1/5 the time of traditional techniques.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is a critically required abundant surface protein of sporozoites and a major vaccine candidate. However, neither the structure nor the role of CSP in sporozoite motility is well understood. Our recent in vitro data, from single-molecule pulling experiments suggested a mechanically pliable structure for P. falciparum CSP. By engineering vegetative cells of the cellular slime-mold Dictyostelium discoideum with regulatable CSP surface expression, we report evidence for direct involvement of CSP towards conferring elastic properties and motility of the cells. With an increase in the surface-CSP levels by 5-8-fold, the Youngs moduli of the cells, observed through atomic force microscopy, decreased around 2-fold, with a concomitant increase in motility by about 2-fold. Interestingly, only full length CSP expression conferred maximal flexibility and motility, as opposed to repeat region alone or the flanking domains of CSP. The enhanced motility of the CSP-expressing cells was abrogated with anti-CSP antibodies as well as phospholipase cleavage of CSP, indicating specific contribution of CSP towards motility. Measurements of the Youngs moduli of Plasmodium berghei midgut (MG) and salivary gland (SG) sporozoites revealed an inverse correlation with CSP levels with a decrease from 1.1 kPa to 0.3 kPa as the CSP concentration doubled from MG to SG sporozoites. We hypothesize that high CSP level lowers the stiffness of sporozoites possibly through its pliable surface-coat, leading to cellular flexibility. These findings may explain a sporozoites developmental ability to enhance its CSP levels during transition from midgut to salivary glands to suit a migratory mode in the host, needed for successful hepatocyte invasion.",

    "abstract": "The study described here was pursued with the idea that information about control of human gene expression might result from comparing the promoter regions of a highly expressed gene population with that of a related population that is weakly expressed. Systematic differences in the two promoter populations would be candidates for a role in causing the distinct expression levels observed. The results reported here were obtained with human genes encoding transcription factors (TF). Among TF genes, those with wide tissue transcription are strongly expressed while those expressed in one or only a few tissues are weakly transcribed in most cases. The promoter regions of the two populations were compared using the results of ChIP-seq experiments. Results demonstrated that the promoter region of broadly expressed TF genes is enriched in binding sites for POLR2A, a component of RNA polymerase II while promoters of tissue targeted genes are enriched in EZH2, a subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). It was rare to observe promoters with binding sites for both POLR2A and EZH2 or for neither one. The findings are interpreted to indicate that strong expression of broadly expressed TF genes is due to the presence of RNA polymerase II at the promoter while weak expression of tissue targeted promoters results from the presence of PRC2. Finally, transcription factor families were compared in the proportion of broadly expressed and tissue targeted genes. The results demonstrated that most families possess both broadly expressed and tissue targeted members. For instance, this was the case with 16 of 20 TF families. The results are interpreted to indicate that while individual TFs such as EZH2 may be specific for broadly expressed or tissue targeted genes, this is not a property of most TF families. Most have both broadly expressed and tissue targeted members.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic regulations play important roles in cell fate determination during neurogenesis, a process by which different types of neurons are generated from neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Although some epigenetic changes are part of developmental and aging processes, the role of tri-methylation on histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and histone 4 lysine 20 (H4K20me3) in primate hippocampal NSPCs remains elusive. This task is best assessed within a context resembling the human brain. As more studies emerge, the baboon represents an excellent model of human central nervous system in addition to their genomic similarity. With a focus on H3K27me3 and H4K20me3, the overarching goal of this work is to reveal their respective epigenetic landscapes in NSPCs of non-human primate baboon hippocampus. We identified putative targets of H3K27me3 and H4K20me3 that suggests a protective mechanism by dual H3K27me3/H4K20me3-mediated repression of specific-lineage gene activation important for differentiation processes while controlling the progression of the cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of technology, the internet is often the first step for potential pet owners searching for an adoptable dog. However, best practices for the online portrayal of shelter and foster dogs remain unclear. Different online photo backgrounds appearing on adoption websites for shelter dogs may impact adoption speed by influencing viewer interest. Online clicking behaviour on pet profiles and human-directed sociability, broadly defined, has been previously linked to increased adoption likelihood. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between photo backgrounds of shelter dogs and online clicking as well as perceived human-directed sociability. In a virtual experiment, 680 participants were asked to rank the sociability and friendliness of four different adoptable dogs on a scale from 0-10. The photo background of each dog was digitally altered and randomly assigned to four experimental background conditions: 1) outdoor, 2) home indoor, 3) in-kennel indoor, and 4) plain coloured. As a proxy for adoption interest, a link to the dogs adoption profile was presented on each slide and the clicking behaviour of participants on this link was recorded. Mixed logistic regression and poisson models revealed that background did not affect participants link-clicking behaviour (chisq = 3.55, df = 3, p = .314) nor perceptions of sociability (statistic = 6.19, df = 3, p = .103). Across all backgrounds, only 4.74% of presented slides culminated in participant link-clicking. Sociability scores also did not predict link clicking. Assessment of participant-related factors and dog ID revealed that link-clicking and sociability scores of photographs were influenced by differences between dogs themselves and unaffected by participants awareness of study hypotheses. We conclude that artificial background types did not affect participant responses. The results demonstrate the importance of empirical data in making marketing decisions in animal shelters. Understanding which aspects of online marketing materials impact viewer interest will provide guidance for both animal shelter personnel and foster families to improve speed of adoption of the animals in their care.",

    "abstract": "Adjacent to the spectacular, rugged coastline bordering the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State, Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS) encompasses 8257 km2 of coastal waters that support one of North Americas most productive marine ecosystems. These rich waters support important recreational, commercial and subsistence fisheries for Washington state and four sovereign tribal governments: the Quinault Indian Nation and the Makah, Quileute and Hoh Tribes. Given its ecological, cultural and economic significance, managers from OCNMS are tasked with monitoring and management towards conserving the areas ecological integrity. The development of metabarcoding with environmental DNA (eDNA) as an effective freshwater monitoring tool has potential applications in marine systems, but the statistical analysis and the interpretation of those eDNA results are still under development. One promising strategy to analyze eDNA is through the use of occupancy models. Occupancy models enable us to calculate probabilities of detection from each taxon sequenced and are designed to work with presence-absence data. To inform our long term monitoring design of this coastal ecosystem, we collected 44 eDNA samples at nine of OCNMS long term mooring sites in 2019 and tested four different molecular markers for species reported and taxonomic richness. Additionally, we assessed occupancy models for use with eDNA to estimate the number of samples required to accurately predict the presence of a species. Occupancy models show great promise for use in eDNA studies provided there is sufficient replication; additionally, the choice of molecular marker strongly influences a taxas probability of detection.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe show the utility of using occupancy models with eDNA in Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary for monitoring near-shore marine biological communities. Based on probabilities of detection, long term coastal monitoring projects using eDNA would benefit from designs prioritizing sample number (10-20 samples per site) over sites sampled. With proper study design, occupancy models provide a statistical framework for comparisons between sites and over time. By accounting for simple non-detection vs true absence, occupancy models help to eliminate noise from eDNA studies, increasing detection of true shifts in community composition. We also demonstrate that marker choice is an important study design consideration not only for the types of taxa recovered, but also for consistency between samples and timepoints.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes to evaluate the performance of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) blast cell detection models in microscopic examination images for faster diagnosis and disease monitoring. One of the popular deep learning algorithms such as You Only Look Once (YOLO) developed for object detection is the successful state-of-the-art algorithms in real-time object detection systems. We employ four versions of the YOLO algorithm: YOLOv3, YOLOv3-Tiny, YOLOv2 and YOLOv2-Tiny for detection of 15-class of AML blood cells in examination images. We also acquired the publicly available dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), which consists of 18,365 expert-labelled single-cell images. Data augmentation techniques are additionally applied to enhance and balance the training images in the dataset. The overall results indicated that four types of YOLO approach have outstanding performances of more than 92% in precision and sensitivity. In comparison, YOLOv3 has more reliable performance than the other three approaches. Consistently, the AUC values for the four YOLO models are 0.969 (YOLOv3), 0.967 (YOLOv3-Tiny), 0.963 (YOLOv2), and 0.948 (YOLOv2-Tiny). Furthermore, we compare the best models performance between approaches that use the entire training dataset without using data augmentation techniques and image division with data augmentation techniques. Remarkably, by using 33.51 percent of the training data in model training, the prediction outcomes from the model that used image partitioning with data augmentation were similar to those obtained using the complete training dataset. This work potentially provides a beneficial digital rapid tool in the screening and evaluation of numerous haematological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Many acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients exhibit hallmarks of immune exhaustion, such as increased myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and dysfunctional T cells. We have developed a mouse model of AML driven by Flt3-ITD and Tet2 deficiency displays these immune-related features, including CD8+ T cells exhibiting a terminally exhausted phenotype (TEx). This T cell subset has been shown to be refractory to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) monotherapy. Here we show that small molecule inhibitors which target bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins affect both tumor-intrinsic factors but also rescue T cell exhaustion and ICB resistance. Ex vivo treatment of cells from AML mice and AML patients with BET inhibitors (BETi) reversed CD8+ T cell exhaustion by restoring proliferative capacity and expansion of the more functional precursor exhausted T cells (TPEx). This reversal is enhanced by combined BETi and anti-PD1 treatment. Finally, we show that BETi synergizes with anti-PD1 in vivo, resulting in the reduction of circulating leukemia cells, enrichment of CD8+ T cells in the bone marrow, and increased expression of Tcf7, Slamf6, and Cxcr5 in CD8+ T cells. In total, we show the potential efficacy of combining BETi and ICB therapy in the treatment of AML.",

    "abstract": "The current liver organ shortage has pushed the field of liver transplantation to develop new methods to prolong the preservation time of livers from the current clinical standard of static cold storage. Our approach, termed partial freezing, aims to induce a thermodynamically stable frozen state at deeper storage temperatures (-10{degrees}C to -15{degrees}C) than can be achieved with supercooling, while simultaneously maintaining a sufficient unfrozen fraction to limit dehydration and ice damage. This research first demonstrated that partially frozen glycerol treated rat livers were functionally similar after thawing from either -10 or -15{degrees}C with respect to subnormothermic machine perfusion metrics and histology. Next, we assessed the effect of adding either of two ice modulators, antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP) and a polyvinyl alcohol/polyglycerol combination (X/Z-1000), on the viability and structural integrity of partially frozen rat livers compared to glycerol-only control livers. Results showed that AFGP livers had high levels of ATP and the least edema but suffered from significant endothelial cell damage. X/Z-1000 livers had the highest levels of ATP and energy charge (EC) but also demonstrated endothelial damage and post-thaw edema. Glycerol-only control livers exhibited the least DNA damage on Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining but also had the lowest levels of ATP and EC. Further research is necessary to optimize the ideal ice modulator cocktail for our partial-freezing protocol. Modifications to cryoprotective agent (CPA) combinations, as well as improvements to machine perfusion CPA loading and unloading, can help improve the viability of these partially frozen organs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMagnetic compression for creating gastrojejunostomy has many advantages according to previous studies. However, following mechanical device release after healing, the anastomotic stenosis becomes the pivotal point.\n\nMethodsRectangle-shaped magnets were used for magnetic compression in rabbits. Both paclitaxel-loaded magnets and a strategy of pyloric ligation were chosen to improve the gastrojejunostomy. Based on these choices, the half-capsule was applied to occlude the pylorus after anastomotic formation. The size and patency of the anastomoses were analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of these approaches. A histological examination was also performed.\n\nResultsThe positive effect of ligating the pylorus on gastrojejunostomy was significantly greater than that achieved using paclitaxel-loaded magnets during either short- or long-term follow-up. There were fewer scar tissue and collagen fibers at the anastomotic site in the treatment group than in the control group. The anastomotic aperture was of great interest at 9 months after the ligation of the pylorus following magnetic compression. In the view of the jejunum, although the aperture was barely visible, gastric juice was continuously spilling through it like a spring, and the aperture was clearly visible from the stomach side. All half-capsules failed to block the pylorus.\n\nConclusionThe effect of paclitaxel on maintaining gastrojejunostomy patency was temporary. The ligation of the pylorus ensured the long-term patency of gastrojejunostomy, and the aperture was comparable to the pylorus which could play an anti-reflux role. Further studies for the sort of gastrointestinal aperture are being planned.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial blight, one of the oldest and severe diseases of rice poses a major threat towards global rice production and food security. Thereafter, sustainable management of this disease has given paramount importance globally. In the current study, we explored 792 landraces to evaluate their disease reaction status against three highly virulent strains (BXo69, BXo87 and BXo93) of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Subsequently, we intended to identify the possible candidate resistant (R) genes responsible for the resistant reaction using six STS markers correspond to Xa4, xa5, Xa7, xa13, Xa21 and Xa23 genes and finally, we evaluated morphological and molecular diversity of the potential bacterial blight resistant germplasm using quantitative traits and ISSR markers. Based on pathogenicity test, a single germplasm was found as highly resistant while, 33 germplasm were resistant and 40 were moderately resistant. Further molecular study on these 74 germplasm divulged that 41 germplasm carried Xa4 gene, 15 carried xa5 gene, 62 carried Xa7 gene, 33 carried xa13 gene, and 19 carried Xa23 gene. Only a single germplasm consisted of Xa21 gene. Interestingly, we found a wide range of gene combinations ranged from 2 to 4 genes among the germplasm resistant to bacterial blight and G3 genotype (Acc. No. 4216; highly resistant) having Xa4, Xa7, xa13, Xa21 and G43 genotype (Acc. No. 1523; resistant) having Xa4, xa5, xa13 and Xa23 gene combination being the most effective against all the Xoo strains. Nonetheless, UPGMA dendrogram and heatmap analysis based on quantitative traits identified two important clusters viz. cluster-III and cluster-VIII with multiple desired traits However, genetic similarity based on ISSR marker data pointed out 3 germplasm, namely, G20 (Acc. No. 4004; contained Xa4, Xa7, xa13 genes), G17 (Acc. No. 3981; contained Xa7, xa13 genes) and G6 (Acc. No. 991; contained Xa4, Xa7, xa13, Xa23 genes) having comparatively lower genetic similarity (0.30, 0.37 and 0.38, respectively) with elite variety BRRI dhan28. Notably, Mantle test of molecular and morphological data indicated that there was a positive correlation (r = 0.113) between them.

    "abstract": "Strawberry powdery mildew (Podosphaera aphanis) causes serious losses in UK crops, potentially reducing yields by as much as 70%. Consequently, conventional fungicide application programmes tend to recommend a prophylactic approach using insurance sprays, risking the development of fungicide insensitivity and requiring careful management relative to harvest periods to avoid residual fungicides on harvested fruit. This paper describes the development of a prediction system to guide the control of P. aphanis by the application of fungicides only when pathogen infection and disease progression are likely. The system was developed over a 15-year period on commercial farms starting with its establishment, validation and then deployment to strawberry growers. This involved three stages: 1. Identification and validation of parameters for inclusion in the prediction system (2004-2008). 2. Development of the prediction system in compact disc format (2009-2015). 3. Development and validation of the prediction system in a web-based format and cost-benefit analysis (2016-2020). The prediction system was based on the temporal accumulation of conditions (temperature and relative humidity) conducive to the development of P. aphanis, which sporulates at 144 accumulated disease-conducive hours. Sensitivity analysis was performed to refine the prediction system parameters. Field validation of the results demonstrated that to effectively control disease, the application of fungicides was best done between 125 and 144 accumulated hours of disease-conducive conditions. A cost-benefit analysis indicated that, by comparison with the number and timing of fungicide applications in conventional insurance disease control programmes, the prediction system enabled good disease control with significantly fewer fungicide applications (between one and four sprays less) (df=7, t=7.6, p=0.001) and reduced costs (savings between {pound}35-{pound}493/hectare) (df=7, t=4.0, p=0.01) for the growers.",

    "abstract": "Retinoic acid (RA) plays major roles during nervous system development, and during regeneration of the adult nervous system. We have previously shown that components of the RA signaling pathway are upregulated after optic nerve injury, and that exogenous application of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) greatly increases the survival of axotomized retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of ATRA application on the macrophages in the optic nerve after injury, and to determine whether this affects axonal regeneration. The optic nerve was crushed and treated with PBS, ATRA and/or clodronate-loaded liposomes. Nerves were examined at one and two weeks after axotomy with light microscopy, immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. ATRA application to the optic nerve caused transient increases in the number of macrophages and microglia one week after injury. The macrophages are consistently labeled with M2-type markers, and have considerable phagocytic activity. ATRA increased ultrastructural features of ongoing phagocytic activity in macrophages at one and two weeks. ATRA treatment also significantly increased the numbers of regenerating GAP-43-labeled axons. Clodronate liposome treatment depleted macrophage numbers by 80%, completely eliminated the ATRA-mediated increase in axonal regeneration, and clodronate treatment alone decreased axonal numbers by 30%. These results suggest that the success of axon regeneration is partially dependent on the presence of debris-phagocytosing macrophages, and that the increases in regeneration caused by ATRA are in part due to their increased numbers. Further studies will examine whether macrophage depletion affects RGC survival.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeMicrostructure imaging with advanced diffusion MRI (dMRI) techniques have shown increased sensitivity and specificity to microstructural changes in various disease and injury models. Oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) dMRI, implemented by varying the oscillating gradient frequency, and microscopic anisotropy ({micro}A) dMRI, implemented via tensor valued diffusion encoding, may provide additional insight by increasing sensitivity to smaller spatial scales and disentangling fiber orientation dispersion from true microstructural changes, respectively. The aims of this study were to characterize the test-retest reproducibility of in vivo OGSE and {micro}A dMRI metrics in the mouse brain at 9.4 Tesla and provide estimates of required sample sizes for future investigations.\n\nMethodsEight adult C57Bl/6 mice were scanned twice (5 days apart). Each imaging session consisted of multifrequency OGSE and {micro}A dMRI protocols. Metrics investigated included {micro}A, isotropic and anisotropic kurtosis, and the diffusion dispersion rate ({Lambda}), which explores the power-law frequency dependence of mean diffusivity. The dMRI metric maps were analyzed with mean region-of-interest (ROI) and whole brain voxel-wise analysis. Bland-Altman plots and coefficients of variation (CV) were used to assess the reproducibility of OGSE and {micro}A metrics. Furthermore, we estimated sample sizes required to detect a variety of effect sizes.\n\nResultsBland-Altman plots showed negligible biases between test and retest sessions. ROI-based CVs revealed high reproducibility for both {micro}A (CVs < 8 %) and {Lambda} (CVs < 15 %). Voxel-wise CV maps revealed high reproducibility for {micro}A (CVs [~] 10 %), but low reproducibility for OGSE metrics (CVs [~] 50 %).\n\nConclusionMost of the {micro}A dMRI metrics are reproducible in both ROI-based and voxel-wise analysis, while the OGSE dMRI metrics are only reproducible in ROI-based analysis. {micro}A and {Lambda} may provide sensitivity to subtle microstructural changes (4 - 8 %) with feasible sample sizes (10 - 15).",

    "abstract": "Providing Virtual Reality(VR) users with a 3D representation of their body complements the experience of immersion and presence in the virtual world with the experience of being physically located and more personally involved. A full-body avatar representation is known to induce a Sense of Embodiment (SoE) for this virtual body, which is associated with improvements in task performance, motivation and motor learning. Recent experimental research on embodiment provides useful guidelines, indicating the extent of discrepancy tolerated by users and, conversely, the limits and disruptive events that lead to a break in embodiment (BiE). Based on previous works on the limit of agency under movement distortion, this paper describes, studies and analyses the impact of a very common yet overlooked embodiment limitation linked to articular limits when performing a reaching movement. We demonstrate that perceiving the articular limit when fully extending the arm provides users with an additional internal proprioceptive feedback which, if not matched in the avatars movement, leads to the disruptive realization of an incorrect posture mapping. This study complements previous works on self-contact and visuo-haptic conflicts and emphasizes the risk of disrupting the SoE when distorting users movements or using a poorly-calibrated avatar.",

Serum and aqueous humor (AH) samples of 75 patients with idiopathic uveitis were analyzed by multiplex immunoassay. Infectious controls consisted of 16 patients with ocular toxoplasmosis all confirmed by intraocular fluid analyses. Noninfectious controls consisted of 7 patients with Behcet disease related uveitis and 15 patients with sarcoidosis related uveitis. The control group consisted of AH and serum samples from 47 noninflammatory control patients with age-related cataract. In each sample, 27 immune mediators {+/-} IL-21 and IL-23 were measured. In idiopathic uveitis, 13 of the 29 mediators, including most proinflammatory and vascular mediators such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, G-CSF, GM-CSF, MCP-1, IP-10, TNF- and VEGF, were significantly elevated in the aqueous humor when compared to all controls. Moreover, IL-17, IP-10, and IL-21, were significantly elevated in the serum when compared to all controls. We clustered 4 subgroups of idiopathic uveitis using a statistical analysis of hierarchical unsupervised classification, characterized by the order of magnitude of concentrations of intraocular cytokines. The pathogenesis of idiopathic uveitis is characterized by the presence of predominantly proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and vascular endothelial growth factor with high expression levels as compared to other causes of uveitis. There are indications for obvious Th-1/ IL21-Th17 pathways but also IL9-Th9 and increased IFN-{gamma}-inducing cytokine (IL12) and IFN-{gamma}-inducible CXC chemokine (IP-10). The combined data suggest that immune mediator expression is different among idiopathic uveitis. This study suggests various clusters among the idiopathic uveitis group rather than one specific uveitis entity.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of bacteriophages is likely unparalleled in the biome due to the immense variety of hosts and the multitude of viruses that infect them. Recent efforts have led to description at the genomic level of numerous bacteriophages that infect the Actinobacteria, but relatively little is known about those infecting other prokaryotic phyla, such as the purple non-sulfur photosynthetic -proteobacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus. This species is a common inhabitant of freshwater ecosystems and has been an important model system for the study of photosynthesis. Additionally, it is notable for its utilization of a unique form of horizontal gene transfer via a bacteriophage-like element known as the gene transfer agent (RcGTA). Only three bacteriophages of R. capsulatus had been sequenced prior to this report. Isolation and characterization at the genomic level of 26 new bacteriophages infecting this host advances the understanding of bacteriophage diversity and the origins of RcGTA. These newly discovered isolates can be grouped along with three that were previously sequenced to form six clusters with four remaining as single representatives. These bacteriophages share genes with RcGTA that seem to be related to host recognition. One isolate was found to cause lysis of a marine bacterium when exposed to high titer lysate. Although some clusters are more highly represented in the sequenced genomes, it is evident that many more bacteriophage types that infect R. capsulatus are likely to be found in the future.",

Establishing novel antiviral tools capable of preventing or treating Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Mayaro virus (MAYV) infections are needed. The use of plant-based compounds that affect the replication cycles of these viruses has been proposed as a promising strategy. Chiococca alba (L.) Hitchc. is a neotropical plant used by Yucatec Mayas traditional healers, mainly, as antipyretic and antirheumatic. To evaluate the potential of C. alba methanolic extracts against CHIKV and MAYV through preliminary analysis in vitro and in silico. The cytotoxicity profile of two C. alba roots methanolic extracts in Vero cells was performed by lysosomal viability using the neutral red assay, and the antiviral potential was determined by plaque assay. We further assessed, through in silico computational predictions, the possible interactions between the active site of the nsP2 proteases of these viruses with some secondary metabolites present in C. alba extracts, identified by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Our partial phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of flavonoids, and phenolic acids in the C. alba extracts. Our in vitro assays showed that both C. alba extracts inhibited more than 70% of CHIKV and MAYV activities at 60 {micro}g/mL concentration. Based on our in silico computational predictions, the flavonoids naringin and vitexin showed the greatest affinity energies with the CHIKV and MAYV nsP2 proteases, revealing the great potential of these compounds as viral inhibitors. The findings described here indicates that C. alba extracts, or their secondary metabolites, as a potential source of novel antiviral compounds.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAn. funestus is a major Afrotropical vector of human malaria. This study sought to investigate the larval ecology, sporozoite infection rates and blood meal sources of An. funestus in western Kenya.\n\nMethodsLarval surveys were carried out in Bungoma (Highland) and Kombewa (lowland) of western Kenya. Aquatic habitats were identified, characterized, georeferenced and carefully examined for mosquito larvae and predators. Indoor resting mosquitoes were sampled using pyrethrum spray catches. Adults and larvae were morphologically and molecularly identified to species. Sporozoite infections and blood meal sources were detected using real-time PCR and ELISA respectively.\n\nResultsOf the 151 aquatic habitats assessed, 62/80 (78%) in Bungoma and 58/71(82%) in Kombewa were positive for mosquito larvae. Of the 3,193 larvae sampled, An. funestus larvae constitute 38% (1224/3193). Bungoma recorded a higher number of An. funestus larvae (85%, 95%, CI, 8.722-17.15) than Kombewa (15%, 95%, CI, 1.33-3.91). Molecular identification of larvae showed that 89% (n=80) were An. funestus. Approximately 59%, 35% and 5% of An. funestus larvae co-existed with An. gambiae s.l, Culex spp and An. coustani in the same habitats respectively. Of 1,221 An. funestus s.l adults sampled, molecular identifications revealed that An. funestus constituted 87% (n=201) and 88% (n=179) in Bungoma and Kombewa, respectively. The Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rate of An. funestus in Bungoma and Kombewa was 2% (3/174) and 1% (2/157), respectively, and the human blood index of An. funestus was 84% (48/57) and 89% (39/44) and for Bungoma and Kombewa, respectively.\n\nConclusionMan-made ponds had the highest abundance of An. funestus larvae. Multiple regression and principal component analyses identified the distance to the nearest house as the key environmental factor associated with the abundance of An. funestus larvae in aquatic habitats. This study serves as a guide for the control of An. funestus and other mosquito species to complement existing vector control strategies.",

In this article, we compare and discuss six nonlinear allometric models parameterized at different scales (local, regional and pantropical). We also evaluate the height measurements obtained in the field by the hypsometer when compared with the true tree height. We used a dataset composed of 180 harvested trees in two distinct areas located in the Amapa State. The functional form of the Weibull model was the best local model, showing similar performance to the pantropical model. The inaccuracy detected in the hypsometer estimates reinforces the importance of incorporating new technologies in measuring individual tree heights. Establishing accurate allometric models requires knowledge of ecophysiological and environmental processes that govern vegetation dynamics and tree height growth. It is essential to investigate the influence of different species and ecological gradients on the diameter/height ratio.",

    "abstract": "In various leguminous crops, chickpea is the fourth most important legume contributing 3.1% to the total legume production. Grains of chickpea are rich source of proteins, minerals and vitamins which makes them suitable for both food and feed. For any crop to be improved, the knowledge of genetic diversity of wild and elite cultivar is very important. Therefore among various available marker systems, molecular markers are more reliable and accurate, therefore are very commonly used for genetic diversity analysis, phylogenetic studies and cultivar identification. Due to several advantages of Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) markers in present study we analyzed the genetic diversity, structure, cross-species transferability and allelic richness in 50 chickpea collection using 23 ISSR markers. The observed parameters such as allele number varied from 3 to 16, and PIC varied from 0.15 to 0.4988 respectively. Further, range of allele size varied from 150 to 1600 bp which shows the significance of ISSR markers for chickpea germplasms characterization. On the basis of ISSR marker genotypic data dendrogram were constructed which divides these 50 chickpea in group I and II showing the reliability of ISSR markers. Among 50 chickpea, the accession P 74-1 is in group I and rest are in group II. Further we made mini-core collection of 15 diverse chickpea and subgrouped them. Dendrogram, PCA, Dissimilarity matrix and Bayesian model based genetic clustering of 50 chickpea germplasms revealed that P 74-1,P 1883, P 1260 very diverse chickpea accession. Characterization of these diverse chickpea would help in maintenance breeding, conservation and in future could be used to develop climate resilient elite cultivar of chickpea. Utilization of these novel ISSRs markers in diversity analysis and population structure characterization of 50 chickpea germplasm suggests their wider efficacy in superior scale for molecular breeding studies in chickpea.",

This study focused on comparing the ferns community assemblages in tropical forests of Malaysia and Nigeria, thereby assessing the patterns of the species richness and diversity across the two continents. The diversity and taxonomic compositions of ferns were assessed using 180 plots of size 10 m x 10 m in each country. The species richness and other diversity indices were determined using the combined forests data for each country and for the individual forests. The observed and rarefied-extrapolated fern species richness are significantly higher in Malaysian forests than Nigerian forests. Also, the other diversity indices (Simpson index, Margalef index, and Fishers alpha) are significantly higher in Malaysian forests except Shannon index which showed no significant difference between the two biogeographic regions. There is a very low similarity in the taxonomic composition of ferns between the two biogeographic areas, although the similarity in composition increased with increasing taxonomic levels (genus and family levels). Terrestrial and epiphytic ferns are more dominant than the other life forms in the two countries. Since the two countries receive varying degrees of environmental factors, we then hypothesize that these observed differences are due to climatic differences as well as historical and evolutionary processes.",

    "abstract": "Alphitobius diaperinus (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), the lesser mealworm, is one of the most significant pests of the poultry industry worldwide. These insects cause structural damage in poultry houses and transmit several diseases, impacting chickens productivity and rearing costs. Although semiochemicals may offer alternative insect pest management strategies, basic information regarding pheromone identity and their role on the behavioural ecology according to their circadian pattern of sexual behaviour of A. diaperinus is essentially lacking. This study is aimed to analyse the relation of gender identity and sexual experience of adults of A. diaperinus on their mating behaviour and whether this response is related to their CHC profiles secreted. The following steps were taken to achieve the studys goal. First, the circadian pattern of their sexual activity was observed in newly emerged pairs for at least twenty-one days (virgin adults) and experienced adults collected from the field to identify a difference based on their sexual experience and achieve the optimal mating season to develop the following assays. Subsequently, Y-tube olfactometer bioassays were conducted to evaluate their odour bouquet attraction based on gender and sexual experience. Additionally, mating behaviour bioassays were conducted to evaluate the two factor effects. Finally, cuticular analysis was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to evaluate possible chemical differences based on the two factors. With statistical and multivariate analysis, we found that behavioural, mating and chemical responses are different based on their sexual experience. The mating sequences were described into precopulatory, copulatory and postcopulatory phases. This finding gives us a deeper understanding of the sexual communication during mating. In summary, our findings provide new insights into the mating system and chemical ecology of A. diaperinus. The results presented here may serve as a base for further studies to develop strategies for managing this pest.",

    "abstract": "Modestly increased expression of transactive response DNA binding protein (TDP-43) gene have been reported in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and other neuromuscular diseases. However, whether this modest elevation triggers neurodegeneration is not known. Although high levels of TDP-43 overexpression have been modeled in mice and shown to cause early death, models with low-level overexpression that mimic the human condition have not been established. In this study, transgenic mice overexpressing wild type TDP-43 at less than 60% above the endogenous CNS levels were constructed, and their phenotypes analyzed by a variety of techniques, including biochemical, molecular, histological, behavioral techniques and electromyography. The TDP-43 transgene was expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in the cortex and predominantly in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord. The mice developed a reproducible progressive weakness ending in paralysis in mid-life. Detailed analysis showed [~]30% loss of large pyramidal neurons in the layer V motor cortex; in the spinal cord, severe demyelination was accompanied by oligodendrocyte injury, protein aggregation, astrogliosis and microgliosis, and elevation of neuroinflammation. Surprisingly, there was no loss of lower motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord despite the complete paralysis of the hindlimbs. However, denervation was detected at the neuromuscular junction. These results demonstrate that low-level TDP-43 overexpression can cause diverse aspects of ALS, including late-onset and progressive motor dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Our findings suggest that persistent modest elevations in TDP-43 expression can lead to ALS and other neurological disorders involving TDP-43 proteinopathy. Because of the predictable and progressive clinical paralytic phenotype, this transgenic mouse model will be useful in preclinical trial of therapeutics targeting neurological disorders associated with elevated levels of TDP-43.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of lipolysis has widespread effects on intermediary metabolism and organismal phenotypes. Defects in lipolysis can be modeled in Drosophila melanogaster through genetic manipulations of brummer (bmm), which encodes a triglyceride lipase orthologous to mammalian Adipose Triglyceride Lipase. RNAi-mediated knock-down of bmm in all tissues or metabolic specific tissues results in reduced locomotor activity, altered sleep patterns and reduced lifespan. Metabolomic analysis on flies in which bmm is downregulated reveals a marked reduction in medium chain fatty acids, long chain saturated fatty acids and long chain monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and an increase in diacylglycerol levels. Elevated carbohydrate metabolites and tricarboxylic acid intermediates indicate that impairment of fatty acid mobilization as an energy source may result in upregulation of compensatory carbohydrate catabolism. bmm downregulation also results in elevated levels of serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitters, possibly accounting for the impairment of locomotor activity and sleep patterns. Physiological phenotypes and metabolomic changes upon reduction of bmm expression show extensive sexual dimorphism. Altered metabolic states in the Drosophila model are relevant for understanding human metabolic disorders, since pathways of intermediary metabolism are conserved across phyla.",

    "abstract": "AbstractKdm6a/Utx, a gene on the X chromosome, encodes a histone K27me3 demethylase that has an orthologue on the Y chromosome (Uty)[1]. We previously identified inactivating mutations of Kdm6a in approximately 50% of mouse acute promyelocytic leukemia samples; however, somatic mutations of KDM6A are more rare in human AML samples, ranging in frequency from 2-15% in different series of patients, where their role in pathogenesis is not yet clear. In this study, we show that female Kdm6aflox/flox mice (with allele inactivation initiated by Vav1-Cre in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have a sex-specific phenotype that emerges with aging, with features resembling a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Female Kdm6a-knockout (KO) mice have an age-dependent expansion of their HSPCs with aberrant self-renewal, but they did not differentiate normally into downstream progeny. These mice became mildly anemic and thrombocytopenic, but did not develop overt leukemia, or die from these cytopenias. ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq studies showed only minor changes in H3K27me3, H3K27ac, H3K4me, H3K4me3 and chromatin accessibility between Kdm6a-WT and Kdm6a-KO mice. Utilizing scRNA-seq, Kdm6a loss was linked to the transcriptional repression of genes that mediate hematopoietic cell fate determination. These data demonstrate that Kdm6a plays an important role in normal hematopoiesis, and that its inactivation may contribute to AML pathogenesis by altering the epigenetic state of HSPCs.",

    "abstract": "Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) experience partial or complete upper airway collapses during sleep resulting in nocturnal hypoxia-normoxia cycling. And continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the golden treatment for OSA. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms of action, especially the transcriptome effect of CPAP on OSA patients, remains elusive. The goal of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal alterations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells transcriptome profiles of OSA patients in order to identify the hub gene and immune response. GSE133601 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We identified black module via weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), the genes in which were correlated significantly with the clinical trait of CPAP treatment. Finally, eleven hub genes (TRAV10, SNORA36A, RPL10, OBP2B, IGLV1-40, H2BC8, ESAM, DNASE1L3, CD22, ANK3, ACP3) were traced and used to construct a random forest model to predict therapeutic efficacy of CPAP in OSA with a good performance with AUC of 0.92. We further studied the immune cells infiltration in OSA patients with CIBERSORT, and monocytes were found to be related with the remission of OSA and partially correlated with the hub genes identified. In conclusion, these key genes and immune infiltration may be of great importance in the remission of OSA and related research of these genes may provide a new therapeutic target for OSA in the future.",

    "abstract": "Hormonal fluctuations, such as the perinatal period, may increase susceptibility of women to depression, which in turn exert a negative impact on childs neurodevelopment, becoming a risk factor in development of neuropsychiatric disorders. Moreover, the use of antidepressants during this critical period presents a serious health concern for both the mother and the child, due to the consequences of treatment in terms of the reliability and safety for the proper neurodevelopment of the organism being not well known. Atypical antidepressants, such as mirtazapine, that targets both serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the central nervous system (CNS), represent a novel focus of research due to its unique pharmacological profile. The aim of this work was to study the effects of maternal depression and/or perinatal antidepressant mirtazapine treatment on the neurobehavioral development of the offspring. Pre-gestationally chronically stressed or non-stressed Wistar rat dams were treated with either mirtazapine (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle during pregnancy and lactation followed by analysis of offsprings behavior at juvenile and adolescent age. We found mirtazapine induced alterations of nursing behavior. In offspring, pregestational stress (PS) had an anxiogenic effect on adolescent males and increased their active behavior in forced swim test. Interaction between pregestational stress and mirtazapine treatment variously induced anxiolytic changes of juvenile and adolescent females and impairment of spatial memory in adolescent females as well. Hippocampal density of synaptophysin, pre-synaptic protein marker, was decreased mainly by mirtazapine treatment. In conclusion, our results show mirtazapine induced alterations in maternal behavior and several sex- and age-dependent changes in neurobehavioral development of offspring caused by both prenatal mirtazapine treatment and/or chronic pregestational stress.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge-based approaches use the statistics collected from protein data-bank structures to estimate effective interaction potentials between amino acid pairs. Empirical relations are typically employed that are based on the crucial choice of a reference state associated to the null interaction case. Despite their significant effectiveness, the physical interpretation of knowledge-based potentials has been repeatedly questioned, with no consensus on the choice of the reference state. Here we use the fact that the Flory theorem, originally derived for chains in a dense polymer melt, holds also for chain fragments within the core of globular proteins, if the average over buried fragments collected from different non-redundant native structures is considered. After verifying that the ensuing Gaussian statistics, a hallmark of effectively non-interacting polymer chains, holds for a wide range of fragment lengths, we use it to define a  bona fide reference state. Notably, despite the latter does depend on fragment length, deviations from it do not. This allows to estimate an effective interaction potential which is not biased by the presence of correlations due to the connectivity of the protein chain. We show how different sequence-independent effective statistical potentials can be derived using this approach by coarse-graining the protein representation at varying levels. The possibility of defining sequence-dependent potentials is explored.",

    "abstract": "Glucocorticoids inhibit angiogenesis by activating the glucocorticoid receptor. Inhibition of the glucocorticoid-activating enzyme 11{beta}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11{beta}-HSD1) reduces tissue-specific glucocorticoid action and promotes angiogenesis in murine models of myocardial infarction. Angiogenesis is important in the growth of some solid tumours. This study used murine models of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to test the hypothesis that 11{beta}-HSD1 inhibition promotes angiogenesis and subsequent tumour growth. SCC or PDAC cells were injected into female FVB/N or C57BL6/J mice fed either standard diet, or diet containing the 11{beta}-HSD1 inhibitor UE2316. SCC tumours grew more rapidly in UE2316-treated mice, reaching a larger (P<0.01) final volume (0.158 {+/-} 0.037 cm3) than in control mice (0.051 {+/-} 0.007 cm3). However, PDAC tumour growth was unaffected. Immunofluorescent analysis of SCC tumours did not show differences in vessel density (CD31/alpha-smooth muscle actin) or cell proliferation (Ki67) after 11{beta}-HSD1 inhibition, and immunohistochemistry of SCC tumours did not show changes in inflammatory cell (CD3- or F4/80-positive) infiltration. In culture, the growth/viability (assessed by live cell imaging) of SCC cells was not affected by UE2316 or corticosterone. Second Harmonic Generation microscopy showed that UE2316 reduced Type I collagen (P<0.001), whilst RNA-sequencing revealed that multiple factors involved in the innate immune/inflammatory response were reduced in UE2316-treated SCC tumours.\n\n11{beta}-HSD1 inhibition increases SCC tumour growth, likely via suppression of inflammatory/immune cell signalling and extracellular matrix deposition, but does not promote tumour angiogenesis or growth of all solid tumours.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is projected result in higher frequencies of drought events across the world and lead to reduced performance in many temperate tree species. However, many studies in this area focus specifically on adult tree drought responses and overlook how trees in other age classes might differ in their vulnerability. Evidence shows that seedling drought response can differ from that of adults and furthermore that demographic performance in the seedling age class will have disproportionately strong effects on the assembly dynamics of future forests, together suggesting that understanding seedling drought responses will be critical to our ability to predict how forests will respond to climate change. In this study, we measured four indices of hydraulic response to drought (leaf water potential, photosynthetic capacity, non-structural carbohydrate concentration, and hydraulic conductivity), as well as interaction effects with shade treatments, for seedlings of two temperate tree species that differ in their adult drought response: isohydric Acer saccharum and anisohydric Quercus rubra. We found a strong isohydric response in A. saccharum seedlings that included conservation of leaf water potentials (>-1.8 MPa) and reductions in non-structural carbohydrate concentrations consistent with reduction of stomatal conductance. Quercus rubra seedlings were able to survive to more negative water potentials, but only rarely, and they showed a similar reduction in photosynthetic capacity as was found for A. saccharum. Our results suggest that, although Q. rubra seedlings display some anisohydric responses to drought, they are more isohydric than adults. Both species seem to be relatively similar in their vulnerability to drought despite the differences predicted from adult drought response, and our results suggest that seedlings of both species will be similarly vulnerable to future drought events.",

    "abstract": "The underlying molecular pathophysiology of feeding disorders, particularly in peripheral organs, is still largely unknown. A range of molecular factors encoded by appetite-regulating genes are already described to control feeding behaviour in the brain. However, the important role of the gastrointestinal tract in the regulation of appetite and feeding in connection to the brain has gained more attention in the recent years. An example of such inter-organ molecular interaction can be the signals mediated by leptin, a key regulator of body weight, food intake and metabolism, with conserved anorexigenic effects in vertebrates. Leptin signal functions through its receptor (lepr) in multiple organs, including the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. So far, the regulatory connections between leptin signal and other appetite-regulating genes remain unclear, particularly in the gastrointestinal system. In this study, we used a zebrafish mutant with impaired function of leptin receptor to explore gut expression patterns of appetite-regulating genes, under different feeding conditions (normal feeding, 7-day fasting, 2 and 6-hours refeeding). We compared these expression patterns to those from wild-type zebrafish, in order to identify leptin-dependent differentially expressed genes located in the zebrafish gut. We provide evidence that most appetite-regulating genes are expressed in the zebrafish gut. On one hand, we did not observed significant differences in the expression of orexigenic genes after changes in the feeding condition, and only one orexigenic gene, hcrt, displayed differential expression under impaired leptin signal. On the other hand, we found 8 anorexigenic genes in wild-types (cart2, cart3, dbi, oxt, nmu, nucb2a, pacap and pomc), as well as 4 genes in lepr mutants (cart3, kiss1, kiss1r and nucb2a), to be differentially expressed in the zebrafish gut after changes in feeding conditions. Most of these genes also showed significant differences in their expression between wild-type and lepr mutant in at least one of the feeding conditions. Finally, we observed that impaired leptin signalling influences potential regulatory connections between anorexigenic genes in zebrafish gut, particularly connections involving cart2, cart3, kiss1, kiss1r, mchr2, nmu, nucb2a and oxt. Altogether, these transcriptional changes propose a potential role of the gastrointestinal tract in the regulation of feeding through changes in expression of certain anorexigenic genes in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Organisms with low effective population sizes are at greater risk of extinction because of reduced genetic diversity. Dipodomys elator is a kangaroo rat that is classified as threatened in Texas and field surveys from the past 50 years indicate that the distribution of this species has decreased. This suggests geographic range reductions that could have caused population fluctuations, potentially impacting effective population size. Conversely, the more common and widespread D. ordii is thought to exhibit relative geographic and demographic stability. Genetic variation between D. elator and D. ordii samples was assessed using 3RAD, a modified restriction site associated sequencing approach. It was hypothesized that D. elator would show lower levels of nucleotide diversity, observed heterozygosity, and effective population size when compared to D. ordii. Also of interest was identifying population structure within contemporary samples of D. elator and detecting genetic variation between temporal samples that could indicate demographic dynamics. Up to 61,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed. It was determined that genetic variability and effective population size in contemporary D. elator populations were lower than that of D. ordii, that there is only slight, if any, structure within contemporary D. elator populations, and there is little genetic differentiation between spatial or temporal historical samples suggesting little change in nuclear genetic diversity over 30 years. Results suggest that genetic diversity of D. elator has remained stable despite claims of reduced population size and/or abundance, which may indicate a metapopulation-like system, whose fluctuations might counteract any immediate decrease in fitness.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the evolution of fatty liver metabolism of ducks is a recurrent issue for researchers and industry. Indeed, the increase in weight during the overfeeding period leads to an important change in the liver metabolism. However, liver weight is highly variable at the end of overfeeding within a batch of animals reared, force-fed and slaughtered in the same way. For this study, we performed a proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) analysis on two classes of fatty liver samples, called low-weight liver (weight between 550 and 599 g) and high-weight liver (weight above 700 g). The aim of this study was to identify the differences in metabolism between two classes of liver weight (low and high). Firstly, the results showed that increased liver weight is associated with higher glucose uptake leading to greater lipid synthesis. Secondly, this increase is probably also due to a decline in the level of export of triglycerides and cholesterol from the liver by maintaining them at high hepatic concentration levels. Finally, the increase in liver weight could lead to a significant decrease in the efficiency of aerobic energy metabolism associated with a significant increase in the level of oxidative stress.",

The samples were analyzed for freshness via total volatile nitrogenous bases and physicochemical characteristics (pH in 24 h, water activity, water retention capacity, dripping loss, cooking loss, and shear force). There was a statistical difference for total nitrogenous volatile bases and shear force with higher values in the rainy season (24 month-of-old animals). Additionally, pH and water activity differed statistically at 24 h in the same period, albeit for 18-month-of-old animals. It was possible to conclude that climate variation affected the freshness and physicochemical characteristics of the pirarucu blankets while age did not.",

    "abstract": "The photochemically-induced thrombosis(photothrombosis) method can create focal cerebral infarcts anywhere in the relatively superficial layers of the cerebrum; it is easy to implement and minimally invasive. Taking advantage of this versatility, we aimed to establish a new rat model of urinary frequency with focal cerebral infarction, which was characterized by its simplicity, nonlethal nature, and high reproducibility. The prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, which are urinary centers, were targeted for focal cerebral infarction, and urinary parameters were measured by cystometrogram. Cystometric analysis indicated that micturition intervals significantly shortened in photothrombosis-treated rats compared with those in the sham operative group on Days 1 and 7 (P < 0.01), but prolonged after 14 days, with no difference between the two groups. Immunopathological evaluation showed an accumulation of activated microglia, followed by an increase in reactive astrocytes at the peri-infarct zone after photothrombotic stroke. Throughout this study, all postphotothrombosis rats showed cerebral infarction in the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex; there were no cases of rats with fatal cerebral infarction. This model corresponded to the clinical presentation, in that the micturition status changed after stroke. In conclusion, this novel model combining nonlethality and high reproducibility may be a suitable model of urinary frequency after focal cerebral infarction.",
