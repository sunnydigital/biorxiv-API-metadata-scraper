    "abstract": "The claustrum is an irregular and fine sheet of grey matter in the basolateral telencephalon present in almost all mammals. The claustrum has been the object of several studies using animal models and more recently in human beings using neuroimaging. Believed to be involved in cognition and disease such as fear recognition, suppression of natural urges, multisensory integration, conceptual integration, seizures, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinsons disease. Nevertheless, the function of the claustrum still remains unclear. We present a functional connectivity study of the claustrum in order to identify its main networks. Resting state functional and anatomical MRI data from 100 healthy subjects were analyzed; taken from the Human Connectome Project (HCP, NIH Blueprint: The Human Connectome Project), with 2x2x2 mm3 voxel resolution. Positive functional connectivity was found (p<0.05, FDR corrected) between the claustrum and the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, pre-central and postcentral gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and subcortical areas. Our findings coincide with the results previously reported in both animal models and studies with humans. Showing the claustrum as a well-connected structure not only structurally but also functionally. Evidencing the claustrum as a node participating in different neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Enzyme kinetic constants in vivo are largely unknown, which limits the construction of large metabolic models. While model fitting, in principle, aims at fitting kinetic constants to measured metabolic fluxes, metabolite concentrations, and enzyme concentrations, the resulting estimation problems are typically non-convex and hard to solve, especially if models are large. Here we assume that metabolic fluxes are known and show how consistent kinetic constants, metabolite concentrations, and enzyme concentrations can be determined simultaneously from data. If one specific term is omitted - a term that penalises small enzyme concentrations - we obtain a convex optimality problem with a unique local optimum. The estimation method with or without this term, called model balancing, applies to models with a wide range of rate laws and accounts for thermodynamic constraints on kinetic constants and metabolite concentrations through thermodynamic forces. It can be used to estimate in-vivo kinetic constants from omics data, to complete and adjust available data, or to construct plausible metabolic states with a predefined flux distribution. As a demonstrative case, we balance a model of E. coli central metabolism with artificial or experimental data. The tests show what information about kinetic constants can be obtained from omics data, and reveal the practical limits of estimating in-vivo kinetic constants.",

This study considers the effects of climatic variability and gradients of herbage utilisation by grazing on root production over the course of two years. The root and leaf traits of the plant communities were determined to detect their capacity to predict above- and below-ground net primary production, ANPP and BNPP, respectively.\n\nMethodsA long-term field experiment was used to compare the effects of abandonment and low (Ca-) and high (Ca+) grazing intensities (resulting in mean residual plant heights of 15.2 cm and 7.7 cm, respectively) induced by grazing rotations on upland fertile grasslands after 10 years of treatment application. Ingrowth cores and exclusion cages were used to measure, respectively, the root and shoot mass production several times each year and at an annual scale. The root and leaf traits of the communities were measured near the vegetations peak growing season.\n\nResultsWe observed strong seasonal root production across treatments in both a wet and a dry year, but the response to grazing intensity was hardly observable within growing seasons. In the abandonment treatment, the spring and autumn root growth peaks were delayed by approximately one month compared to the two cattle treatments, possibly due to a late plant canopy green-up induced by lower soil temperatures and an accumulation of litter. The BNPP was slightly lower in the abandonment treatment compared to the cattle treatments only during the dry year, whereas a decline of the ANPP in the abandonment treatment compared to the Ca+ treatment was observed during the wet year. In response to drought, which occurred during the second year, the root-to-shoot biomass ratio was stable in the cattle treatments but declined in the abandonment treatment. The higher allocation to root mass could benefit plant communities under drier conditions.\n\nConclusionsRotational grazing pressures and climatic condition variabilities had limited effects on root growth seasonality, although drought had stronger effects on the BNPP than on the ANPP. The stability of the root-to-shoot biomass ratio during the dry year evidenced a higher resistance to drought by grazed versus abandoned grassland communities.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of brain-scale functional networks at rest and during cognitive tasks is the subject of intense research efforts to unveil fundamental principles of brain functions. To estimate these large-scale brain networks, the emergent method called \"electroencephalography (EEG) source connectivity\" has generated increasing interest in the network neuroscience community, due to its ability to identify cortical brain networks with satisfactory spatio-temporal resolution, while reducing mixing and volume conduction effects. However, no consensus has been reached yet regarding a unified EEG source connectivity pipeline, and several methodological issues have to be carefully accounted for to avoid pitfalls. Thus, a validation toolbox that provides flexible \"ground truth\" models is needed for an objective methods/parameters evaluation and, thereby an optimization of the EEG source connectivity pipeline. In this paper, we show how a recently developed large-scale model of brain-scale activity, named COALIA, can provide to some extent such ground truth by providing realistic simulations of source-level and scalp-level activity. Using a bottom-up approach, the model bridges cortical micro-circuitry and large-scale network dynamics. Here, we provide an example of the potential use of COALIA to analyze, in the context of epileptiform activity, the effect of three key factors involved in the \"EEG source connectivity\" pipeline: (i) EEG sensors density, (ii) algorithm used to solve the inverse problem, and (iii) functional connectivity measure. Results showed that a high electrode density (at least 64 channels) is required to accurately estimate cortical networks. Regarding the inverse solution/connectivity measure combination, the best performance at high electrode density was obtained using the weighted minimum norm estimate (wMNE) combined with the weighted phase lag index (wPLI). Although those results are specific to the considered aforementioned context (epileptiform activity), we believe that this model-based approach can be successfully applied to other experimental questions/contexts. We aim at presenting a proof-of-concept of the interest of COALIA in the network neuroscience field, and its potential use in optimizing the EEG source-space network estimation pipeline.",

Our results indicated that sex should be taken into consideration when treating diabetes, which was further validated by the sex-matched and sex-mismatched islet transplantation in mice. Compared to sex-matched transplants, sex-mismatched transplants showed downregulation of genes involved in the longevity regulating pathway in {beta} cells and led to impaired glucose tolerance in diabetic mice.

    "abstract": "Recent neuroscience studies have suggested that cognitive functions and learning capacity are reflected in the time-evolving dynamics of brain networks. However, an efficient method to detect changes in dynamical brain structures using neural data has yet to be established. To address this issue, we developed a new model-based approach to detect change points in dynamical network structures by combining the model-based network estimation with a phase-coupled oscillator model and sequential Bayesian inference. By giving the model parameter as the prior distribution, applying Bayesian inference allows the extent of temporal changes in dynamic brain networks to be quantified by comparing the prior distribution with posterior distribution using information theoretical criteria. For this, we used the Kullback-Leibler divergence as an index of such changes. To validate our method, we applied it to numerical data and electroencephalography data. As a result, we confirmed that the Kullback-Leibler divergence only increased when changes in dynamical network structures occurred. Our proposed method successfully estimated both directed network couplings and change points of dynamical structures in the numerical and electroencephalography data. These results suggest that our proposed method can reveal the neural basis of dynamic brain networks.",

    "abstract": "CLN5 is a soluble endolysosomal protein whose function is poorly understood. Mutations in this protein cause a rare neurodegenerative disease, Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis. We previously found that depletion of CLN5 leads to dysfunctional retromer, resulting in the degradation of the lysosomal sorting receptor, sortilin. However, how a soluble lysosomal protein can modulate the function of a cytosolic protein, retromer, is not known. In this work, we show that deletion of CLN5 not only results in retromer dysfunction, but also in impaired endolysosome fusion events. This results in delayed degradation of endocytic proteins and in defective autophagy. CLN5 modulates these various pathways by regulating downstream interactions between CLN3, an endolysosomal integral membrane protein whose mutations also result in Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Rab7A, and a subset of Rab7A effectors. Our data supports a model where CLN3 and CLN5 function as an endolysosome complex regulating various functions.\n\nSummary StatementWe have previously demonstrated that CLN3 is required for efficient endosome-to-trans Golgi Network (TGN) trafficking of sortilin by regulating retromer function. In this work, we show that CLN5, which interacts with CLN3, regulates retromer function by modulating key interactions between CLN3, Rab7A, retromer, and sortilin. Therefore, CLN3 and CLN5 serve as endosomal switch regulating the itinerary of the lysosomal sorting receptors.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how organisms adapt to aquatic life at high altitude is fundamental in evolutionary biology. This objective has been addressed primarily related to hypoxia adaptation by recent comparative studies, whereas highland fish has also long suffered extreme alkaline environment, insight into the genomic basis of alkaline adaptation has rarely been provided. Here, we compared the genomes or transcriptomes of 15 fish species, including two alkaline tolerant highland fish species and their six alkaline intolerant relatives, three alkaline tolerant lowland fish species and four alkaline intolerant species. We found putatively consistent patterns of molecular evolution in alkaline tolerant species in a large number of shared orthologs within highland and lowland fish taxa. Remarkably, we identified consistent signatures of accelerated evolution and positive selection in a set of shared genes associated with ion transport, apoptosis, immune response and energy metabolisms in alkaline tolerant species within both highland and lowland fish taxa. This is one of the first comparative studies that began to elucidate the consistent genomic signature of alkaline adaptation shared by highland and lowland fish. This finding also highlights the adaptive molecular evolution changes that support fish adapting to extreme environments at high altitude.\n\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how wild fish responds to extreme alkaline stress besides hypoxia at high altitude. Comparative genomics has begun to elucidate the genomic basis of alkaline adaptation in lowland fish, such as killifish, but insight from highland fish has lagged behind. The common role of adaptive molecular evolution during alkaline adaptation in highland and lowland fish has rarely been discussed. We address this question by comparing 15 fish omics data. We find numbers of shared orthologs exhibited consistent patterns of molecular evolution in alkaline tolerant species relative to intolerant species. We further identify remarkably consistent signatures of rapidly evolving and positive selection in a substantial shared core of genes in both highland and lowland alkaline tolerant species.",

    "abstract": "Most cellular functions are carried out by a dynamic network of interacting proteins. An open question is whether the network properties of protein interactomes represent phenotypes under natural selection. One proposal is that protein interactomes have evolved to be resilient, such that they tend to maintain connectivity when proteins are removed from the network. This hypothesis predicts that interactome resilience should be maintained by natural selection during long-term experimental evolution. I tested this prediction by modeling the evolution of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks in Lenskis long-term evolution experiment with Escherichia coli (LTEE). In this test, I removed proteins affected by nonsense, insertion, deletion, and transposon mutations in evolved LTEE strains, and measured the resilience of the resulting networks. I compared the rate of change of network resilience in each LTEE population to the rate of change of network resilience for corresponding randomized networks. The evolved PPI networks are significantly more resilient than networks in which random proteins have been deleted.\n\nMoreover, the evolved networks are generally more resilient than networks in which the random deletion of proteins was restricted to those disrupted in LTEE. These results suggest that evolution in the LTEE has favored PPI networks that are, on average, more resilient than expected from the genetic variation across the evolved strains. My findings therefore support the hypothesis that selection maintains protein interactome resilience over evolutionary time.\n\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding how protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks evolve is a central goal of evolutionary systems biology. One property that has been hypothesized to be important for PPI network evolution is resilience, which means that networks tend to maintain connectivity even after many nodes (proteins in this case) have been removed. This hypothesis predicts that PPI network resilience should be maintained during long-term experimental evolution. Consistent with this prediction, I found that the PPI networks that evolved over 50,000 generations of Lenskis long-term evolution experiment with E. coli are more resilient than expected by chance.",

Defects in gut-brain communication can lead to various neurological disorders. However, it remains unknown whether gut plays any intrinsic role in regulating neuronal development. Through a genetic screen in C. elegans, we uncovered that an intrinsic Wnt-endocrine pathway in gut regulates synaptic development and neuronal activity in brain. Specifically, the Wnt signaling upregulates the expression of the neuropeptide NLP-40 in the gut, which then facilitates presynaptic assembly through the neuronal expressed GPCR AEX-2 receptor during development. The NLP-40 acts most likely through modulating neuronal activity and promoting synaptic protein trafficking. Therefore, this study reveals a novel role of gut in synaptic development in the brain.",

By analysing two large, independent leaf-trait datasets for woody species1,5, we provide quantitative empirical support for the predicted dependencies of LL on LMA and environment in evergreen plants, and for the distinct predicted dependencies of LMA on light, temperature, growing-season length and aridity in evergreen and deciduous plants. We thereby resolve the long-standing question of why deciduous LMA tends to increase (with increasing LL) towards the equator, while evergreen LMA and LL decrease6.

    "abstract": "Plasticity of cell mechanics underlies a wide range of cell and tissue behaviors allowing cells to migrate through narrow spaces, resist shear forces, and safeguard against mechanical damage. Such plasticity depends on spatiotemporal regulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, but mechanisms of adaptive change in cell mechanics remain elusive. Here, we report a mechanism of mechanically activated actin polymerization at focal adhesions, specifically requiring the actin elongation factor mDia1. By combining live-cell imaging with mathematical modelling, we show that actin polymerization at focal adhesions exhibits pulsatile dynamics where spikes of mDia1 activity are triggered by contractile forces. The suppression of mDia1-mediated actin polymerization increases tension on stress fibers leading to an increased frequency of spontaneous stress fiber damage and decreased efficiency of zyxin-mediated stress fiber repair. We conclude that tension-controlled actin polymerization acts as a safety valve dampening excessive tension on the actin cytoskeleton and safeguarding stress fibers against mechanical damage.\n\nSUMMARYValencia et al. report that tension-controlled actin polymerization at focal adhesions mediated by formin mDia1 controls mechanical tension on stress fibers. Suppression of mDia1 increases tension on the actin cytoskeleton leading to a higher rate of stress fiber damage and less efficient stress fiber repair.",

    "abstract": "Hox transcription factors play a conserved role in specifying positional identity during animal development, with posterior Hox genes typically repressing the expression of more anterior Hox genes. Here, we dissect the regulation of the posterior Hox genes nob-1 and php-3 in the nematode C. elegans. We show that nob-1 and php-3 are co-expressed in gastrulation-stage embryos in cells that previously expressed the anterior Hox gene ceh-13. This expression is controlled by several partially redundant transcriptional enhancers. These enhancers require ceh-13 for expression, providing a striking example of an anterior Hox gene positively regulating a posterior Hox gene. Several other regulators also act positively through nob-1/php-3 enhancers, including elt-1/GATA, ceh-20/ceh-40/Pbx, unc-62/Meis, pop-1/TCF, ceh-36/Otx and unc-30/Pitx. We identified defects in both cell position and cell division patterns in ceh-13 and nob-1;php-3 mutants, suggesting that these factors regulate lineage identity in addition to positional identity. Together, our results highlight the complexity and flexibility of Hox gene regulation and function and the ability of developmental transcription factors to regulate different targets in different stages of development.\n\nAuthor SummaryHox genes are critical for head-to-tail patterning during embryonic development in all animals. Here we examine the factors that are necessary to turn on two posterior Hox genes, nob-1 and php-3, in the nematode worm, C. elegans. We identified six new transcription factors and three enhancer regions of DNA that can activate expression of nob-1/php-3. Unexpectedly, these activating transcription factors included ceh-13, an anterior Hox gene, and elt-1, a regulator of skin development that is briefly expressed in many cells that do not adopt skin fates, including the cells that express nob-1. Furthermore, the cellular defects we observed in ceh-13 and nob- 1;php-3 mutant embryos indicate that the early embryonic functions of these Hox genes help determine the identity of cells as well as their position within the embryo. Our findings identify new roles for Hox genes in C. elegans and emphasize the ability of transcription factors to contribute to the diversification of cell types and the adoption of specific cell types at different phases of embryonic development.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages, the viruses infecting bacteria, hold great potential for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections and other applications due to their unparalleled diversity and recent breakthroughs in their genetic engineering. However, fundamental knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying phage-host interactions is mostly confined to a few traditional model systems and did not keep pace with the recent massive expansion of the field. The true potential of molecular biology encoded by these viruses has therefore remained largely untapped, and phages for therapy or other applications are often still selected empirically. We therefore sought to promote a systematic exploration of phage-host interactions by composing a well-assorted library of 66 newly isolated phages infecting the model organism Escherichia coli that we share with the community as the BASEL collection (BActeriophage SElection for your Laboratory). This collection is largely representative of natural E. coli phage diversity and was intensively characterized phenotypically and genomically alongside ten well-studied traditional model phages. We experimentally determined essential host receptors of all phages, quantified their sensitivity to eleven defense systems across different layers of bacterial immunity, and matched these results to the phages host range across a panel of pathogenic enterobacterial strains. Our results reveal clear patterns in the distribution of phage phenotypes and genomic features that highlight systematic differences in the potency of different immunity systems and point towards the molecular basis of receptor specificity in several phage groups. Strong trade-offs were detected between fitness traits like broad host recognition and resistance to bacterial immunity that might drive the divergent adaptation of different phage groups to specific niches. We envision that the BASEL collection will inspire future work exploring the biology of bacteriophages and their hosts by facilitating the discovery of underlying molecular mechanisms as the basis for an effective translation into biotechnology or therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "The recent and growing focus on reproducibility in neuroimaging studies has led many major academic centers to use cloud-based imaging databases for storing, analyzing, and sharing complex imaging data. Flywheel is one such database platform that offers easily accessible, large-scale data management, along with a framework for reproducible analyses through containerized pipelines. The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a data storage specification for neuroimaging data, but curating neuroimaging data into BIDS can be a challenging and time-consuming task. In particular, standard solutions for BIDS curation are not designed for use on cloud-based systems such as Flywheel. To address these challenges, we developed \"FlywheelTools\", a software toolbox for reproducible data curation and manipulation on Flywheel. FlywheelTools includes two elements: fw-heudiconv, for heuristic-driven curation of data into BIDS, and flaudit, which audits and inventories projects on Flywheel. Together, these tools accelerate reproducible neuroscience research on the widely used Flywheel platform.",

    "abstract": "Elevated CO2 (E[CO2]) improves the biomass and yield when combined with water-stress in C4 plants. Although several studies described the molecular response of the C4 plant Sorghum bicolor during drought exposure, none reported its combinatorial effect with E[CO2] in the roots. We decided to perform a molecular analysis using green prop roots, the portion of the radicular system photosynthetically active and more sensible to drought. Whole-transcriptome analysis identified 394 up- and 1,471 down-regulated genes. Among the E[CO2] induced pathways, photosynthesis stood out. Carbon fixation, phenylpropanoid, phenolic compounds, and fatty acid biosynthesis-related pathways were repressed. Protein family analysis showed induction of chlorophyll a-b binding protein family, and repression of glutathione-related enzymes. Protein-protein interaction networks exhibited well-defined clusters, including genes related to cell organization and biogenesis, oxi-reduction process, and photosynthesis being induced. The findings suggest that the E[CO2] mitigates the water deficit by antioxidant and osmoregulation activity, as well as by accumulation of sugar-alcohols in the green prop roots, which may be responsible by the increase in biomass together with the cell proliferation. The higher carbon uptake explains the increase in photosynthetic and primary metabolism activities. Our data revealed that green prop roots present an intriguing metabolism under water deficit and E[CO2], showing its crucial role in the drought tolerance acquisition in a predicted future global atmosphere.",

    "abstract": "Structured abstractIdentifying sample mix-ups in biobanks is essential to allow the repurposing of genetic data for clinical pharmacogenetics. Pharmacogenetic advice based on the genetic information of another individual is potentially harmful. Existing methods for identifying mix-ups are limited to datasets in which additional omics data (e.g. gene expression) is available. Cohorts lacking such data can only use sex, which can reveal only half of the mix-ups. Here, we describe Idefix, a method for the identification of accidental sample mix-ups in biobanks using polygenic scores. In the Lifelines population-based biobank we calculated polygenic scores (PGSs) for 25 traits for 32,786 participants. Idefix then compares the actual phenotypes to PGSs and uses the relative discordance that is expected for mix-ups, compared to correct samples.\n\nIn a simulation, using induced mix-ups, Idefix reaches an AUC of 0.90 using 25 polygenic scores and sex. This is a substantial improvement over using only sex, which has an AUC of 0.75. Idefix therefore is not yet able to identify every sample mix-up. However, this will likely improve soon, with highly powered GWAS summary statistics that will likely become available for more commonly measured traits.\n\nNevertheless, Idefix can already be used to identify a high-quality set of participants for whom it is very unlikely that they reflect sample mix-ups, and therefore could be offered a pharmacogenetic passport. For instance, when selecting the 10% of participants for whom predicted phenotypes adhere best to the actually measured phenotypes, we estimate that the proportion of sample mix-ups is reduced 250-fold.\n\nAvailability and implementationIdefix is freely available at https://github.com/molgenis/systemsgenetics/wiki/Idefix\n\nContactl.h.franke@umcg.nl",

    "abstract": "Little is known about how normal variation in dietary patterns in humans affects the aging process, largely because both nutrition and the physiology of aging are highly complex and multidimensional. Here, we apply the nutritional geometry framework to data from 1560 older adults followed over four years to assess how nutrient intake patterns affect the aging process. Aging was quantified via blood biomarkers integrated to measure loss of homeostasis. Additionally, we extend nutritional geometry to 19 micronutrients. Salient results include benefits of intermediate protein and vitamin E intake. Broadly, we show that there are few simple answers of \"good\" or \"bad\" nutrients - optimal levels are generally intermediate, but dependent on other nutrients. Simpler linear/univariate analytical approaches are insufficient to capture such associations. We present an interactive tool to explore the results, and our approach presents a roadmap for future studies to explore the full complexity of the nutrition-aging landscape.\n\nImpact StatementMultidimensional nutritional analyses reveal how the association between diet and healthy aging is hard to untangle, as most nutrients have non-linear and interactive effects in humans.",

    "abstract": "Pre-existing immune responses towards adenoviral vector limit the use of a vector based on particular serotypes and its clinical applicability for gene therapy and/or vaccination. Therefore, there is a significant interest to vectorize novel adenoviral types that have low seroprevalence in the human population. Here, we describe the discovery and vectorization of a chimeric human adenovirus, which we call HAdV-20-42-42. Full genome sequencing revealed that this virus is closely related to human serotype 42, except for the penton-base which is derived from serotype 20. The HAdV-20-42-42 vector could be propagated stably to high titers on existing E1-complementing packaging cell lines. Receptor binding studies revealed that the vector utilized both CAR and CD46 as receptors for cell entry. Furthermore, the HAdV-20-42-42 vector was potent in transducing human and murine cardiovascular cells and tissues, irrespective of the presence of blood coagulation factor X. In addition, the vector did not sequester in the liver upon intravenous administration in rodents. Finally, we demonstrate that potent T-cell responses against vector-delivered antigens could be induced upon vaccination. In summary, from the data obtained we conclude that HAdV-20-42-42 provides a valuable addition to the portfolio of adenoviral vectors available to develop safe and efficacious products in the fields of gene therapy and vaccination.\n\nIMPORTANCEAdenoviral vectors are currently under investigation for a broad range of therapeutic indications in diverse fields, such as oncology and gene therapy, as well as for vaccination both for human and veterinary use. A wealth of data shows that pre-existing immune responses may limit the use of a vector. Particularly in the current climate of global pandemic, there is a need to expand the toolbox with novel adenoviral vectors for vaccine development. Our data demonstrates that we have successfully vectorized a novel adenovirus serotype with low seroprevalence. The cell transduction data and antigen-specific immune responses induced in vivo demonstrate that this vector is highly promising for the development of gene therapy and vaccine products.",

    "abstract": "Backtracking, the reverse motion of the transcriptase enzyme on the nucleic acid template, is a universal regulatory feature of transcription in cellular organisms but its role in viruses is not established. Here we present evidence that backtracking extends into the viral realm, where backtracking by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) may aid viral transcription and replication. Structures of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp bound to the essential nsp13 helicase and RNA suggested the helicase facilitates backtracking. We use cryo-electron microscopy, RNA-protein crosslinking, and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp backtracking. The results establish that the single-stranded 3-segment of the product-RNA generated by backtracking extrudes through the RdRp NTP-entry tunnel, that a mismatched nucleotide at the product-RNA 3-end frays and enters the NTP-entry tunnel to initiate backtracking, and that nsp13 stimulates RdRp backtracking. Backtracking may aid proofreading, a crucial process for SARS-CoV-2 resistance against antivirals.\n\nSignificance StatementThe COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 genome is replicated and transcribed by its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the target for antivirals such as remdesivir. We use a combination of approaches to show that backtracking (backwards motion of the RdRp on the template RNA) is a feature of SARS-CoV-2 replication/transcription. Backtracking may play a critical role in proofreading, a crucial process for SARS-CoV-2 resistance against many antivirals.",

SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells are initiated by binding with its receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2, and the ACE2 abundance is thought to reflect the susceptibility to infection. Here, we found that clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection and metabolic disorder in human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes. Among 13 approved drugs that we have previously identified as potential inhibitor of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, clomipramine showed the best potency to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein pseudovirus-stimulated ACE2 internalization. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection to human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs) and TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6 cells were dramatically suppressed even after treatment with clomipramine.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess in the context of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), cardiovascular risk factors and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) were associated with brain tissue susceptibility as measured by quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Given that CSVD is diagnosed by the presence of lacunar strokes, periventricular and deep WMHs, increased perivascular spaces, and microbleeds, we expected that QSM could capture changes in brain tissue due to underlying CSVD pathology. We compared a cohort of 101 HIV-infected individuals (mean age (SD) = 53.2 (10.9) years) with mild to moderate cardiovascular risk scores, as measured by the Reynolds risk score, to 102 age-matched controls (mean age (SD) = 50.3 (15.7) years) with similar Reynold scores. We performed brain MRI to assess CSVD burden by acquiring 3D T1-MPRAGE, 3D FLAIR, 2D T2-TSE, and mGRE for QSM. We found that signs of CSVD are significantly higher in individuals with HIV-infection compared to controls and that WMH volumes are significantly correlated with age and cardiovascular risk scores. Regional QSM was associated with cardiovascular risk factors, age, sex, and WMH volumes but not HIV status. These results suggest that QSM may be an early imaging marker reflective of alterations in brain microcirculation.",

    "abstract": "Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice deficient in Gz alpha subunit (Gz) are protected from developing hyperglycemia, even with early islet insulitis similar to wild-type mice. Similarly, wild-type (WT) NOD mice are protected from glucose intolerance when fed a diet enriched in eicosapentaneoic acid (EPA). In the beta-cell, Prostaglandin EP3 receptor (EP3), whose primary endogenous ligand is the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolite, prostaglandin E2, is specifically coupled to Gz. In this work, we tested whether dietary EPA supplementation, thereby reducing systemic PGE2 levels, would complement Gz loss in the NOD mouse model. WT and Gz-null NOD mice were fed an AA-enriched diet, EPA-enriched diet, or control diet upon weaning. After 12 weeks of diet feeding, glucose tolerance tests were performed and pancreatic islets and whole pancreas collected for ex vivo analyses, with the longer-term effect of an EPA-enriched diet on splenic T-cell populations quantified via flow cytometry. Our results reveal a polyunsaturated fatty acid-enriched diet, whether AA or EPA, improves wild-type NOD glucose tolerance by the same magnitude as Gz loss, but through almost completely different physiological and cellular mechanisms. Our results shed critical light on future research into novel pharmacological and dietary adjuvant therapies for T1D.",

    "abstract": "Studies of hippocampal learning have obtained seemingly contradictory results, with manipulations that increase coactivation of memories sometimes leading to differentiation of these memories, but sometimes not. These results could potentially be reconciled using the nonmonotonic plasticity hypothesis, which posits that representational change (memories moving apart or together) is a U-shaped function of the coactivation of these memories during learning. Testing this hypothesis requires manipulating coactivation over a wide enough range to reveal the full U-shape. To accomplish this, we used a novel neural network image synthesis procedure to create pairs of stimuli that varied parametrically in their similarity in high-level visual regions that provide input to the hippocampus. Sequences of these pairs were shown to human participants during high-resolution fMRI. As predicted, learning changed the representations of paired images in the dentate gyrus as a U-shaped function of image similarity, with neural differentiation occurring only for moderately similar images.",

    "abstract": "Residual systemic inflammation and mucosal immune dysfunction persist in people living with HIV (PLWH) despite treatment with combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART), but the underlying immune mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we report an altered immune landscape involving upregulation of TLR- and inflammasome signaling, localized CD4+ T cell hyperactivation, and counterintuitively, an enrichment of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the oral mucosa of HIV+ patients on therapy. Using human oral tonsil cultures, we found that HIV infection causes an increase in a unique population of FOXP3+ cells expressing PD-1, IFN-{gamma}, Amphiregulin (AREG), and IL-10. These cells persisted even in the presence of the anti-retroviral drug and underwent further expansion driven by TLR-2 ligands and IL-1{beta}. IL-1{beta} also promoted PD-1 upregulation in AKT1 dependent manner. PD-1 stabilized FOXP3 and AREG expression in these cells through a mechanism requiring the activation of Asparaginyl Endopeptidase (AEP). Importantly, these FOXP3+ cells were incapable of suppressing CD4+ T cells in vitro. Concurrently, HIV+ patients harbored higher levels of PD-1, IFN-{gamma}, Amphiregulin (AREG), and IL-10 expressing FOXP3+ cells, which strongly correlated with CD4+ T cell hyperactivation, suggesting an absence of CD4+ T cell regulation in the oral mucosa. Taken together, this study provides insights into a novel mechanism of FOXP3+ cell dysregulation and reveals a critical link in the positive feedback loop of oral mucosal immune activation events in HIV+ patients on therapy.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryHIV-induced immune dysfunction in lymphoid and mucosal tissues",

    "abstract": "We used an embryo lethality assay (ELA) to assess virulence for different isolates from cases of bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis (BCO) in broilers. ELA has been used to measure virulence and lethal dosage of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus cecorum. We hypothesized that ELA could substitute for more laborious and costly assessments of BCO isolate pathogenicity using live birds. We evaluated two different levels of bacteria injected into eggs from layer and commercial broiler embryos. Significant findings include a) Escherichia coli from neighboring farms operated by the same integrator had very different embryo lethality, b) isolate Staphylococcus agnetis 908 had low virulence in ELA, even though this isolate can induce more than 50% BCO lameness, c) Enterococcus cecorum 1415 also had low pathogenicity; even though it was recovered from severe bilateral tibial dyschondroplasia, d) human and chicken isolates of S. aureus had significant pathogenicity, e) virulence for some isolates was highly variable possibly corresponding with quality of the embryos/fertile eggs used, and f) ELA pathogenicity was much lower for our BCO isolates than previous reports which may reflect maternal environment. Overall, ELA virulence and BCO virulence are not always concordant indicating that that ELA may not be an effective measure for assessing virulence with respect to BCO.\n\nImportanceLameness is among the most significant animal welfare issues in the poultry industry. Bacterial infections are a major cause of lameness and different bacterial species have been obtained from lame broilers. Reliable lab-based assays are required to assess relative virulence of bacteria obtained from lame broilers. Embryo Lethality Assays have been used to compare virulence. Our results suggest that this assay may not be an effective measure of virulence related to lameness.",

Anti-staphylococcal phage lysins represent important candidate adjunctive agents against invasive MRSA infections because of both their microbicidal and anti-biofilm properties. We utilized the rabbit model of aortic valve infective endocarditis (using the prototype MRSA strain, MW2) to examine the combined efficacy of the lysin, LSVT-1701, plus daptomycin. LSVT-1701 was given at two dose-regimens (32.5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) with different dose-durations (single dose vs daily dose for 2 d vs daily dose for 4 d); daptomycin was given at a sub-lethal daily dose of 4 mg/kg for 4 d to maximize potential synergistic interaction outcomes. The combination of LSVT-1701 plus daptomycin was highly effective at reducing target tissue MRSA counts (cardiac vegetations, kidneys, and spleen), especially when the lysin was given for multiple days and/or at higher daily doses. Of importance, when given for four daily doses, both lysin dose-regimens in combination with daptomycin sterilized all target tissues. These findings suggest that LSVT-1701 warrants further clinical evaluation as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of invasive MRSA infections.",

    "abstract": "In order to explore the effect of added bacteria on microbial community and determine the dominant bacteria in the aerobic composting process of household food waste (HFW), two groups of HFW composting experiments were conducted for 30 days. The final degradation rates of the two groups were 69.95% (group A, natural composting) and 73.52% (Group C, composting with added bacteria), respectively. 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the changes of microbial community in the composting process. As the result displays, at the classification of phylum level, the relatively abundant bacteria of two groups were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria. At the classification of genus level, Pediococcus is the dominant bacteria of group A, which performed better in maintaining the microbial community stable in the later stage of composting, while Weissella accounted for a relatively large proportion of group C and behaved well in promoting the final degradation rate of composting. The proportion of Ochrobactrum in the early stage of group C is considerable and it is closely related to the removal of odour during composting. The relative abundance of added bacteria was always in a rather low level, suggested that the way they affect the composting process is to change the proportion of dominant bacteria in different stage of composting. This experiment provides an important reference for improving the microbial degradation efficiency of HFW.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn recent years, food waste has gradually become a global problem, the annual waste of food is as high as 1.3 billion tons. FW, especially HFW, as a high content of organic matter waste, has a pretty good recycling value. So how to deal with and recycle it efficiently, quickly and conveniently becomes more and more important. Among many treatment and recovery methods, microbial treatment (including anaerobic digestion and aerobic composting) has gradually become a research hotspot due to its advantages of low pollution and low energy consumption, and microorganisms play a crucial role in these process.\n\nIn this study we use 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing method to explore aerobic composting of HFW. The purpose of this study is to find out the dominant bacteria which can improve the degradation efficiency, remove the odor and prolong the treatment cycle, and then provide further theoretical reference for future HFW related research.",

    "abstract": "Enhanced mechanistic insight into age-related knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is an essential step to promote successful translation of animal research to bedside interventions. To this end, the goal of these studies was to interrogate molecular mechanisms driving age-related KOA in a mouse model and correspond findings to human knee cartilage. Unbiased mass spectrometry proteomics of cartilage tissue revealed PI3K/Akt signaling was the predominant pathway disrupted over time in male, but not female, mice. This finding was consistent with a significantly accelerated KOA progression in males when compared to female counterparts. In probing for upstream regulators of these age-dependent alterations, we found that -Klotho, a suppressor of PI3K/Akt signaling and potent longevity protein, significantly decreased with aging in both mouse and human knee cartilage. Upstream of these alterations, we found that age-related increases in matrix stiffness initiated a cascade of altered nuclear morphology and downregulated -Klotho expression, ultimately impairing chondrocyte health. Conversely, reducing matrix stiffness increased -Klotho expression in chondrocytes, thus enhancing their chondrogencity and cartilage integrity. Collectively, our findings establish a novel mechanistic link between age-related alterations in ECM biophysical properties and regulation of cartilage health by -Klotho.",

    "abstract": "Ingestion of nutrients elicits essential physiological responses, including absorption, digestion, cessation of feeding and nutrient storage. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is central to this nutritional homeostasis, since it regulates intracellular organelle function, drives intercellular communication and promotes metabolite distribution. We identified the Drosophila Creb3L-family transcription factor, CrebA, as the key metabolic regulator of ER function, thereby affecting lipid metabolism and feeding behavior. In response to feeding, CrebA activity is rapidly and transiently activated. CrebA directly drives the expression of the ER protein sorting machinery. We demonstrate that CrebA levels regulate lipid metabolism through lipoprotein secretion into the hemolymph and suppress feeding behavior. Further, CrebA mouse homologs are also upregulated in the liver following feeding and drive the transcriptional activation of ER protein sorting machinery genes in mammals. Our results reveal an evolutionarily conserved transcription switch which is turned on in response to food ingestion and orchestrates a negative feedback loop that promotes satiety by regulating ER function and protein secretion.",

    "abstract": "Desiccation tolerance was a key trait that allowed plants to colonize land. However, little is known about the transition from desiccation tolerant non-vascular plants to desiccation sensitive vascular ones. Filmy ferns (Hymenophyllaceae) represent a useful system to investigate how water-stress strategies differ between non-vascular and vascular stages within a single organism because they have vascularized sporophytes and nonvascular gametophytes that are each capable of varying degrees of desiccation tolerance. To explore this, we surveyed sporophytes and gametophytes of 19 species (22 taxa including varieties) of filmy ferns on Moorea (French Polynesia) and used chlorophyll fluorescence to measure desiccation tolerance and light responses. We conducted phylogenetically informed analyses to identify differences in physiology between life stages and growth habits. Gametophytes had similar or less desiccation tolerance (ability to recover from 2 d desiccation at -86 MPa) and lower photosynthetic optima (maximum electron transport rate of photosystem II and light level at 95% of that rate) than sporophytes. Epiphytes were more tolerant of desiccation than terrestrial species in both life stages. Despite their lack of greater physiological tolerances, gametophytes of several species occurred over a wider elevational range than conspecific sporophytes. Our results demonstrate that filmy fern gametophytes and sporophytes differ in their physiology and niche requirements, and point to the importance of microhabitat in shaping the evolution of water-use strategies in vascular plants.",

    "abstract": "Next Generation sequencing was a step change for molecular genetics and genomics. Illumina sequencing in particular still provides substantial value to animal and plant genomics. A simple yet powerful technique, referred to as QTL sequencing (QTL-seq) is susceptible to high levels of noise due to ambiguity of alignment of short reads in complex regions of the genome. This noise is particularly high when working with polyploid and/or outcrossing crop species, which impairs the efficacy of QTL-seq in identifying functional variation. By filtering loci based on the optimal alignment of short reads, we have developed a pipeline, named Khufu, that substantially improves the accuracy of QTL-seq analysis in complex genomes, allowing de novo variant discovery directly from bulk sequence. We first demonstrate the pipeline by identifying and validating loci contributing to blanching percentage in peanut using lines from multiple related populations. Using other published datasets in peanut, Brassica rapa, Hordeum volgare, Lactua satvia, and Felis catus, we demonstrate that Khufu produces more accurate results straight from bulk sequence. Khufu works across species, genome ploidy level, and data types. In cases where identified QTL were fine mapped, the fine mapped region corresponds to the top of the peak identified by Khufu. The accuracy of Khufu allows the analysis of population sequencing at very low coverage (<3x), greatly decreasing the amount of sequence needed to genotype even the most complex genomes.",

    "abstract": "Since Ohsawa et al. reported a biological antioxidant function of hydrogen in 2007, researchers have now shown it to exert protective effects in a wide range of human and animal disease models. Clinical observations and scientific arguments suggest that a selective scavenging property of H2 cannot adequately explain the beneficial effects of hydrogen. However, there is no experiment challenging the original published data, which suggested that molecular hydrogen dissolved in solution reacts with hydroxyl radicals in cell-free systems. Here we report that a hydrogen-saturated solution (0.6 mM) did not significantly reduce hydroxyl radicals in the Fenton system using 1 mM H2O2. We replicated the same condition as Ohsawas study (i.e. 5 {micro}M H2O2), and observed a decrease in *OH radicals in both the H2-rich and N2-rich solutions, which may be caused by a decreased dissolved oxygen concentration. Finally, we determined the effect of hydrogen on a high-valence iron enzyme, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and found that hydrogen could directly increase HRP activity in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, these results indicate that although H2 and *OH can react, the reaction rate is too low to have physiological function. The target of hydrogen is more complex, and its interaction with enzymes or other macro-molecules deserve more attention and in-depth study.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCopy number variants (CNVs) are the gain or loss of DNA segments in the genome. Studies have shown that CNVs are linked to various disorders, including autism, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia.\n\nConsequently, the interest in studying a possible association of CNVs to specific disease traits is growing. However, due to the specific multi-dimensional characteristics of the CNVs, methods for testing the association between CNVs and the disease-related traits are still underdeveloped. We propose a novel multi-dimensional CNV kernel association test (MCKAT) in this paper. We aim to find significant associations between CNVs and disease-related traits using kernel-based methods.\n\nResultsWe address the multi-dimensionality in CNV characteristics. We first design a single pair CNV kernel, which contains three sub-kernels to summarize the similarity between two CNVs considering all CNV characteristics. Then, aggregate single pair CNV kernel to the whole chromosome CNV kernel, which summarizes the similarity between CNVs in two or more chromosomes. Finally, the association between the CNVs and disease-related traits is evaluated by comparing the similarity in the trait with kernel-based similarity using a score test in a random effect model. We apply MCKAT on genome-wide CNV datasets to examine the association between CNVs and disease-related traits, which demonstrates the potential usefulness the proposed method has for the CNV association tests. We compare the performance of MCKAT with CKAT, a uni-dimensional kernel method. Based on the results, MCKAT indicates stronger evidence, smaller p-value, in detecting significant associations between CNVs and disease-related traits in both rare and common CNV datasets.\n\nConclusionA multi-dimensional copy number variant kernel association test can detect significantly associated CNVs with any disease-related trait. MCKAT can help biologists detect significantly associated CNVs with any disease-related trait across a patient group instead of examining the CNVs case by case in each subject.",

    "abstract": "We develop tools to explore and catalogue the topologies of knotted or pseudoknotted circular folds due to secondary and tertiary interactions within a closed loop of RNA which generate multiple double-helices due (for example) to strand complementarity. The fold topology is captured by a  contracted fold which merges helices separated by bulges and removes hairpin loops. Contracted folds are either trivial or pseudoknotted. Strand folding is characterised by a rigid-vertex  polarised strand graph, whose vertices correspond to double-helices and edges correspond to strands joining those helices. Each vertex has a plumbline whose polarisation direction defines the helical axis. That polarised graph has a corresponding circular ribbon diagram and canonical alphanumeric fold label. Key features of the  fully-flagged fold are the arrangement of complementary domains along the strand, described by a numerical bare fold label, and a pair of binary  flags: a parity flag that specifies the twist in each helix (even or odd half-twists), and an orientation flag that characterises each double-helix as parallel or antiparallel. A simple algorithm is presented to translate an arbitrary fold label into a polarised strand graph. Any embedding of the graph in 3-space is an admissible fold geometry; the simplest embeddings minimise the number of edge-crossings in a planar graph drawing. If that number is zero, the fold lies in one of two classes: (a)-type  relaxed folds, which contain conventional junctions and (b)-type folds whose junctions are described as meso-junctions in H. Wang and N.C. Seeman, Biochem, vol. 34, pp920-929. (c)-type folds induce polarised strand graphs with edge-crossings, regardless of the planar graph drawing. Canonical fold labelling allows us to sort and enumerate all  semi-flagged folds with up to six contracted double-helices as windings around the edges of a graph-like fold skeleton, whose cyclomatic number - the  fold genus - ranges from 0 - 3, resulting in a pair of duplexed strands along each skeletal edge. Those semi-flagged folds admit both even and odd double-helical twists. Appending specific parity flags to those semi-flagged folds gives fully-flagged (a)-type folds, which are also enumerated up to genus-3 cases. We focus on all-antiparallel folds, characteristic of conventional ssRNA and enumerate all distinct (a), (b) and (c)-type folds with up to five double-helices. Those circular folds lead to pseudoknotted folds for linear ssRNA strands. We describe all linear folds derived from (a) or (b)-type circular folds with up to four contracted double-helices, whose simplest cases correspond to so-called H, K and L pseudoknotted folds, detected in ssRNA. Fold knotting is explored in detail, via constructions of so-called antifolds and isomorphic folds. We also tabulate fold knottings for (a) and (b)-type folds whose embeddings minimise the number of edge-crossings and outline the procedure for (c)-type folds. The inverse construction - from a specific knot to a suitable nucleotide sequence - results in a hierarchy of knots. A number of specific alternating knots with up to 10 crossings emerge as favoured fold designs for ssRNA, since they are readily constructed as (a)-type all-antiparallel folds.",

    "abstract": "Marine algae viruses are important for controlling microorganism communities in the marine ecosystem and played fundamental roles during the early events of viral evolution. Here, we have focused on one major group of marine algae viruses, the ssDNA viruses from the Bacilladnaviridae family. We present the capsid structure of the bacilladnavirus, Chaetoceros tenuissimus DNA virus type II (CtenDNAV-II), determined at 2.3 [A] resolution. A structure-based phylogenetic analysis supported the previous theory that bacilladnaviruses have acquired their capsid protein via horizontal gene transfer from a ssRNA virus. The capsid protein contains the widespread virus jelly-roll fold, but has additional unique features; a third {beta}-sheet and a long C-terminal tail. Further, low-resolution reconstructions of the CtenDNAV-II genome revealed a partially spooled structure, an arrangement previously only described for dsRNA and dsDNA viruses. Together, these results exemplify the importance of genetic recombination for the emergence and evolution of ssDNA viruses and provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms that dictate genome organisation.",

Remissions of sarcomas were first reported following repeated injections of patients with mixtures of killed bacteria--Coleys toxins--a phenomenon, which was subsequently causally traced to induction of innate immunity. Here we reveal remission of Drosophila epithelial neoplasms by genetically triggered host innate immunity via Toll signaling. These neoplasms display capacities to receive and, in rare instances, induce Toll signaling. A tumor-induced and progressive Toll signaling, however, did not culminate in tumor suppression. By contrast, Drosophila hosts heterozygous for spn27A1 mutation, which constitutively produce activated Toll ligand, SpzAct, displayed comprehensive tumor remission via Toll-induced, NF-{kappa}B-mediated, tumor cell death. Our results reveal a novel node of host genetic cancer resistance via serpin-dependent Toll signaling.",

Using different concentrations of P. africana extracts, prostate cancer C4-2 cells, a hormonally insensitive subline of LNCaP cells, were treated in a proliferation assay. A concentration dependent inhibition of cell growth in cells treated with P. africana bark and root extracts was present from days 1 through 3 of incubation, with the methanol extract of the bark showing the strongest effect. Compared to other plant parts, leaf extracts were significantly less cytotoxic at the same concentrations. As C4-2 cells are hormonally insensitive and designed to mimic advanced prostate cancer, crude extracts of P. africana are a possible treatment option, not only for hormone sensitive prostate cancer, but also advanced, hormonally insensitive prostate cancer.",

In the challenge to manipulate and enhance C4 photosynthesis, steady state models of leaf photosynthesis provide and important tool for gas exchange analysis and thought experiments that can explore photosynthetic pathway changes. Here the C4 photosynthetic model by von Caemmerer and Furbank (1999) has been updated with new kinetic parameterisation and temperature dependencies added. The parameterisation was derived from experiments on the C4 monocot, Setaria viridis, which for the first time provides a cohesive parametrisation. Mesophyll conductance and its temperature dependence have also been included, as this is an important step in the quantitative correlation between the initial slope of the CO2 response curve of CO2 assimilation and in vitro PEP carboxylase activity. Furthermore, the equations for chloroplast electron transport have been updated to include cyclic electron transport flow and equations have been added to calculate electron transport rate from measured CO2 assimilation rates.\n\nHighlightThe C4 photosynthesis model by von Caemmerer and Furbank (1999) has been updated.

    "abstract": "Cortical feedback has long been considered crucial for modulation of sensory processing. In the mammalian auditory system, studies have suggested that corticofugal feedback can have excitatory, inhibitory, or both effects on the response of subcortical neurons, leading to controversies regarding the role of corticothalamic influence. This has been further complicated by studies conducted under different brain states. In the current study, we used cryo-inactivation in the primary auditory cortex (A1) to examine the role of corticothalamic feedback on medial geniculate body (MGB) neurons in awake marmosets. The primary effects of A1 inactivation were a frequency-specific decrease in the auditory response of MGB neurons coupled with an increased spontaneous firing rate, which together resulted in a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we report for the first-time that A1 robustly modulated the long-lasting sustained response of MGB neurons which changed the frequency tuning after A1 inactivation, e.g., neurons with sharp tuning increased tuning bandwidth whereas those with broad tuning decreased tuning bandwidth. Taken together, our results demonstrate that corticothalamic modulation in awake marmosets serves to enhance sensory processing in a way similar to center-surround models proposed in visual and somatosensory systems, a finding which supports common principles of corticothalamic processing across sensory systems.",

Innate resistance to Cryptosporidium, which specifically invades enterocytes, is dependent on the production of IFN-{gamma}, yet whether enterocytes contribute to parasite control is poorly understood. In this study, utilizing the natural mouse pathogen, Cryptosporidium tyzzeri, we show that epithelial-derived IL-18 synergized with IL-12 to stimulate innate lymphoid cell (ILC) production of IFN-{gamma}. This innate IFN-{gamma} was required for early parasite control. Loss of STAT1 in enterocytes, but not dendritic cells or macrophages, antagonized early parasite control. Transcriptional profiling of enterocytes from infected mice identified an IFN-{gamma} signature and enrichment of anti-microbial effectors like IDO, GBP and IRG. Deletion experiments identified a role for Irgm1/m3 in parasite control. Thus, enterocytes promote ILC production of IFN-{gamma} that acts on enterocytes to restrict the growth of C. tyzzeri.",

Recent studies are increasingly revealing a spectacular array of functions encoded in their genomes, including genes for energy metabolisms, nutrient uptake, as well as cytoskeleton. Here, we report the discovery of genes homologous to myosins, the major eukaryotic motor proteins previously unrecognized in the virosphere, in environmental genomes of NCLDVs from the surface of the oceans. Interestingly, these genes were often accompanied by kinesin genes in the environmental genomes, suggesting a role of these viral proteins in the intracellular viral particle transport. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that most viral myosins (named \"virmyosins\") belong to the Imitervirales order, except for one belonging to the Phycodnaviridae family. On the one hand, the phylogenetic positions of virmyosin-encoding Imitervirales are scattered within the Imitervirales. On the other hand, Imitervirales virmyosin genes form a monophyletic group in the phylogeny of diverse myosin sequences. Furthermore, phylogenetic trends for the virmyosin genes and viruses containing them were incongruent. Based on these results, we argue that multiple transfers of myosin homologs have occurred not only from eukaryotes to viruses but also between viruses, supposedly during co-infections of the same host.",

The results showed that elevated CO2 and heat wave facilitated A. Artemisiifolia growth; further, A. artemisiifolia accumulated large amounts of defensive secondary metabolites. Being fed on A. artemisiifolia grown under elevated CO2 and heat wave conditions resulted in the poor performance of O. communa (high mortality, long development period, and low reproduction). Overall, under elevated CO2, heat wave improved the defensive ability of A. artemisiifolia against herbivores. This implies that heat wave event will relieve harm of A. artemisiifolia to human under elevated CO2.

    "abstract": "Blood coagulates to plug vascular damage and stop bleeding, and thus the function of blood clots in hemostasis depends on their resistance against rupture (toughness). Despite the significance, fracture mechanics of blood clots remains largely unexplored, particularly the measurements of toughness and critical length scales governing clot fracture. Here, we study the fracture behavior of human whole blood clots and platelet-poor plasma clots. The fracture energy of whole blood clots and platelet-poor plasma clots determined using modified lap-shear method is 5.90{+/-}1.18 J/m2 and 0.96{+/-}0.90 J/m2, respectively. We find that the measured toughness is independent of the specimen geometry and loading conditions. These results reveal a significant contribution of blood cells to the clot fracture, as well as the dissipative length scale and nonlinear elastic length scale governing clot fracture.",

    "abstract": "The transmission of high-frequency temporal information across brain regions is critical to perception, but the mechanisms underlying such transmission remain unclear. Long-range projection patterns across brain areas are often comprised of paired feedforward excitation followed closely by delayed inhibition, including the thalamic triad synapse, thalamic projections to cortex, and projections within hippocampus. Previous studies have shown that these joint projections produce a shortened period of depolarization, sharpening the timing window over which the postsynaptic neuron can fire. Here we show that these projections can facilitate the transmission of high-frequency computations even at frequencies that are highly filtered by neuronal membranes. This temporal facilitation occurred over a range of synaptic parameter values, including variations in synaptic strength, synaptic time constants, short-term synaptic depression, and the delay between excitation and inhibition. Further, these projections can coordinate computations across multiple network levels, even amid ongoing local activity. We suggest that paired feedforward excitation and inhibition provides a hybrid signal - carrying both a value and a clock-like trigger - to allow circuits to be responsive to input whenever it arrives.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria has rapidly increased in aquaculture, which highlights the risk of production losses due to diseases and potential public health concerns. Previously, we reported that ozone nanobubbles (NB-O3) were effective at reducing concentrations of pathogenic bacteria in water and modulating fish immunity against pathogens; however, multiple treatments with direct NB-O3 exposures caused alterations to the gills of exposed-fish. Here, we set up a modified recirculation system (MRS) assembled with an NB-O3 device (MRS-NB-O3) to investigate whether MRS-NB-O3 were 1) safe for tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), 2) effective at reducing bacterial load in rearing water, and 3) improved survivability of Nile tilapia following an immersion challenge with a lethal dose of MDR Aeromonas hydrophila. The results indicated no behavioral abnormalities or mortality of Nile tilapia during the 14 day study using the MRS-NB-O3 system. In the immersion challenge, although high bacterial concentration (~2 x 107 CFU/mL) was used, multiple NB-O3 treatments in the first two days reduced the bacteria between 15.9% to 35.6% of bacterial load in water while bacterial concentration increased 13.1% to 27.9% in the untreated control. There was slight up-regulation of non-specific immune-related genes in the gills of the fish receiving NB-O3 treatments. Most importantly, this treatment significantly improved survivability of Nile tilapia with relative percent survival (RPS) of 64.7 - 66.7% in treated fish and surviving fish developed specific antibody against MDR A. hydrophila. In summary, the result suggests that NB-O3 is a promising alternative to antibiotics to control bacterial diseases, including MDR bacteria, and has high potential for application in recirculation aquaculture system (RAS).\n\nHighlightsO_LIMultiple treatments of NB-O3 in a modified recirculation system (MRS) were relatively safe for juvenile Nile tilapia\nC_LIO_LINB-O3 treatments in MRS significantly improved survivability of Nile tilapia challenged with multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. hydrophila with RPS of 64.7 - 66.7%\nC_LIO_LIConcentration of MDR A. hydrophila in MRS was reduced by 15.9 to 35.6% following each NB-O3 treatment, and increased by 13.1 to 27.9 % in untreated control\nC_LIO_LISurviving fish developed specific antibody IgM against MDR A. hydrophila\nC_LIO_LINB-O3 is a promising non-antibiotic approach to control diseases caused by MDR A. hydrophila\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Glycosylation is one of the most abundant forms of post-translational modification, and can have a profound impact on a wide range of biological processes and diseases. Unfortunately, efforts to characterize such modifications in the context of basic and clinical research are severely hampered by the lack of affinity reagents that can differentiate protein glycoforms. This lack of reagents is largely due to the challenges associated with generating affinity reagents that can bind to particular glycan epitopes with robust affinity and specificity. In this work, we use a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based approach to generate and screen aptamers with indole-modified bases in an effort to isolate reagents that can differentiate between protein glycoforms. Using this approach, we were able to select multiple aptamers that exhibit strong selectivity for specific glycoforms of two different proteins, with the capacity to discriminate between molecules with identical tertiary structures that differ only in terms of their glycan modifications.",

    "abstract": "Vectorial substrate efflux by ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which play a major role in multidrug resistance, entails the ATP-powered interconversion of the transporter between stable intermediates. Despite recent progress in structure elucidation of ABC transporters, a number of such intermediates have yet to be visualized and mechanistically interpreted. Here, we combine single particle cryo-EM, Double Electron Electron Resonance (DEER) spectroscopy with Molecular Dynamics simulations to profile and mechanistically frame the conformation of a hitherto unobserved intermediate in the context of BmrCD, a heterodimeric multidrug ABC exporter from Bacillus subtilis. In our cryo-EM structure, BmrCD adopts an inward-facing architecture bound to both ATP and the substrate Hoechst-33342 and is capped by an extracellular domain which undergoes ATP-dependent conformational changes. A striking feature of the structure is a symmetric arrangement of the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) in the presence of ATP whereas binding of Hoechst at two distinct sites in an acidic pocket stabilizes an asymmetric arrangement of the transmembrane domain architecture (TMD). Mutation of residues coordinating Hoechst in the structure abrogates the cooperative stimulation of ATP hydrolysis. In conjunction with previous studies, our findings suggest a mechanistic role for symmetry mismatch between NBDs and TMDs in the conformational cycle of ABC transporters. Moreover, the resolved structures of bimodally-bound drugs are of notable importance for future rational design and optimization of molecules for targeted transport inhibition of ABC transporters.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYCryo-EM and EPR analysis reveal cooperative substrate binding in BmrCD in an architecture primed for transport.",
