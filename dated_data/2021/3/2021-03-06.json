    "abstract": "The question whether and how we are able to monitor our own cognitive states (metacognition) has been a matter of debate for decades. Do we have direct access to our cognitive processes or can we only infer them indirectly based on their consequences? In the current study, we wanted to investigate the brain circuits that underlie the metacognitive experience of fluency in action selection. To manipulate action-selection fluency we used a subliminal response priming paradigm. On each trial, both male and female human participants additionally engaged in the metacognitive process of rating how hard they felt it was to respond to the target stimulus. Despite having no conscious awareness of the prime, results showed that participants rated incompatible trials (during which subliminal primes interfered with the required response) to be more difficult than compatible trials (where primes facilitated the required response) reflecting metacognitive awareness of difficulty. This increased sense of subjective difficulty was mirrored by increased activity in the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ) and the anterior insula, two regions that are functionally closely connected. Importantly, this reflected activations that were unique to subjective difficulty ratings and were not explained by reaction times or prime-response compatibility. We interpret these findings in light of a possible grounding of the metacognitive judgement of fluency in action selection in interoceptive signals resulting from increased effort.",

Ruxolitinib and venetoclax show a dose-dependent effect on T-ALL individually, but combination treatment reduces survival and proliferation of T-ALL in vitro. Using a xenograft model, the combination treatment fails to improve survival, with death from hind limb paralysis. Despite on-target inhibition by the drugs, histopathology demonstrates increased leukemic infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) as compared to liver or bone marrow. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy shows that ruxolitinib and venetoclax insufficiently cross into the CNS. The addition of the CXCR4 inhibitor plerixafor with ruxolitinib and venetoclax reduces clinical scores and enhances survival. While combination therapy with ruxolitinib and venetoclax shows promise for treating T-ALL, additional inhibition of the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis may be needed to maximize the possibility of complete remission.",

However, it relies on gene expression which can be highly variable between conditions, and thus cannot provide a complete picture of the RBP binding landscape. This creates a demand for computational methods to predict missing binding sites. Here we present GraphProt2, a computational RBP binding site prediction framework based on graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs). In contrast to current CNN methods, GraphProt2 offers native support for the encoding of base pair information as well as variable length input, providing increased flexibility and the prediction of nucleotide-wise RBP binding profiles. We demonstrate its superior performance compared to GraphProt and two CNN-based methods on single as well as combined CLIP-seq datasets. Conceived as an end-to-end method, GraphProt2 includes all necessary functionalities, from dataset generation over model training to the evaluation of binding preferences and binding site prediction. Various input types and features are supported, accompanied by comprehensive statistics and visualizations to inform the user about datatset characteristics and learned model properties. All this makes GraphProt2 the most versatile and complete RBP binding site prediction method available so far.",

    "abstract": "In bacteria and other microorganisms, the cells within a population often show extreme phenotypic variation. Different species use different mechanisms to determine how distinct phenotypes are allocated between individuals, including coordinated, random, and genetic determination. However, it is not clear if this diversity in mechanisms is adaptive--arising because different mechanisms are favoured in different environments--or is merely the result of non-adaptive artifacts of evolution. We use theoretical models to analyse the relative advantages of the two dominant mechanisms to divide labour between reproductives and helpers in microorganisms. We show that coordinated specialisation is more likely to evolve over random specialisation in well-mixed groups when: (i) social groups are small; (ii) helping is more \"essential\"; and (iii) there is a low metabolic cost to coordination. We find analogous results when we allow for spatial structure with a more detailed model of cellular filaments. More generally, this work shows how diversity in the mechanisms to produce phenotypic heterogeneity could have arisen as adaptations to different environments.",

We performed genetic complementation and overexpression of H. capsulatum genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to validate reactions identified in the map and to determine enzymes responsible for catalyzing orphan reactions. The map led to the identification of both the fatty acid desaturation and the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathways as targets for drug development. We found that the sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibitor myriocin, the fatty acid desaturase inhibitor thiocarlide and the fatty acid analog 10-thiastearic acid inhibit H. capsulatum growth in nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations. These compounds also reduced the intracellular infection in an alveolar macrophage cell line. Overall, this lipid metabolic map revealed pathways that can be targeted for drug development.",

    "abstract": "Synchronization of neuronal responses over large distances is hypothesized to be important for many cortical functions. However, no straightforward methods exist to estimate synchrony non-invasively in the living human brain. MEG and EEG measure the whole brain, but the sensors pool over large, overlapping cortical regions, obscuring the underlying neural synchrony. Here, we developed a model from stimulus to cortex to MEG sensors to disentangle neural synchrony from spatial pooling of the instrument. We find that synchrony across cortex has a surprisingly large and systematic effect on predicted MEG spatial topography. We then conducted visual MEG experiments and separated responses into stimulus-locked and broadband components. The stimulus-locked topography was similar to model predictions assuming synchronous neural sources, whereas the broadband topography was similar to model predictions assuming asynchronous sources. We infer that visual stimulation elicits two distinct types of neural responses, one highly synchronous and one largely asynchronous across cortex.",

    "abstract": "When gene regulatory networks diverge between species, their dysfunctional expression in inter-species hybrid individuals can create genetic incompatibilities that generate the developmental defects responsible for intrinsic post-zygotic reproductive isolation. Both cis- and trans-acting regulatory divergence can be hastened by directional selection through adaptation, sexual selection, and inter-sexual conflict, in addition to cryptic evolution under stabilizing selection. Dysfunctional sex-biased gene expression, in particular, may provide an important source of sexually-dimorphic genetic incompatibilities. Here, we characterize and compare male and female/hermaphrodite transcriptome profiles for sibling nematode species Caenorhabditis briggsae and C. nigoni, along with allele-specific expression in their F1 hybrids, to deconvolve features of expression divergence and regulatory dysfunction. Despite evidence of widespread stabilizing selection on gene expression, misexpression of sex-biased genes pervades F1 hybrids of both sexes. This finding implicates greater fragility of male genetic networks to produce dysfunctional organismal phenotypes. Spermatogenesis genes are especially prone to high divergence in both expression and coding sequences, consistent with a \"faster male\" model for Haldanes rule and elevated sterility of hybrid males. Moreover, underdominant expression pervades male-biased genes compared to female-biased and sex-neutral genes and an excess of cis-trans compensatory regulatory divergence for X-linked genes underscores a \"large-X effect\" for hybrid male expression dysfunction. Extensive regulatory divergence in sex determination pathway genes likely contributes to demasculinization of XX hybrids. The evolution of genetic incompatibilities due to regulatory versus coding sequence divergence, however, are expected to arise in an uncorrelated fashion. This study identifies important differences between the sexes in how regulatory networks diverge to contribute to sex-biases in how genetic incompatibilities manifest during the speciation process.\n\nAuthors summaryAs species diverge, many mutations that affect traits do so by altering gene expression. Such gene regulatory changes also accumulate in the control of static traits, due to compensatory effects of mutation on multiple regulatory elements. Theory predicts many of these changes to cause inter-species hybrids to experience dysfunctional gene expression that leads to reduced fitness, disproportionately affecting genes biased toward expression in one sex and that localize to sex chromosomes. Our analyses of genome-wide gene expression from Caenorhabditis nematode roundworms support these predictions. We find widespread rewiring of gene regulation, despite the extensive morphological stasis and conserved expression profiles that are hallmarks of these animals. Misregulation of expression in inter-species hybrids of both sexes is most severe for genes linked to the X-chromosome, but male organismal phenotypes are most disrupted in hybrids. This fragility of male genetic networks and sex differences in regulatory evolution of local versus distant elements may underlie feminized and sterile phenotypes among hybrids. Our work clarifies how distinct components of regulatory networks evolve and contribute to sex differences in the manifestation of genetic incompatibilities in the speciation process.",

    "abstract": "Discovering and developing pharmaceutical drugs increasingly relies on mechanistic mathematical modeling and simulation. In immuno-oncology, models that capture causal relations among genetic drivers of oncogenesis, functional plasticity, and host immunity provide an important complement to wet experiments, given the cellular complexity and dynamics within tumors. Unfortunately, formulating such mechanistic cell-level models currently relies on hand curation by experts, which can bias how data is interpreted or the priority of drug targets. In modeling molecular-level networks, rules and algorithms have been developed to limit a priori biases in formulating mechanistic models. To realize an equivalent approach for cell-level networks, we combined digital cytometry with Bayesian network inference to generate causal models that link an increase in gene expression associated with onco-genesis with alterations in stromal and immune cell subsets directly from bulk transcriptomic datasets. To illustrate, we predicted how an increase in expression of Cell Communication Network factor 4 (CCN4/WISP1) altered the tumor microenvironment using data from patients diagnosed with breast cancer and melanoma. Digital cytometry and network inference predictions were then tested using two immunocompetent mouse models for melanoma, which provided consistent experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Quiet standing exhibits strongly intermittent variability that has inspired at least two interpretations. First, variability can be intermittent through the alternating engagement and disengagement of complementary control processes at distinct scales. A second and perhaps deeper way to interpret this intermittency is through the possibility that postural control depends on cascade-like interactions across many timescales at once, suggesting specific non-Gaussian distributional properties at different timescales. Multiscale probability density function (PDF) analysis shows that quiet standing on a stable surface exhibits a crossover from low, increasing non-Gaussianity (consistent with exponential distributions) at shorter timescales, reflecting inertial control, towards higher non-Gaussianity. Feedback-based control at medium to longer timescales yields a linear decrease characteristic of cascade dynamics. Destabilizing quiet standing with unstable surface or closed eyes serves to attenuate inertial control and to elicit more of the feedback-based control over progressively shorter timescales. The result was to strengthen the appearance of the linear decay indicating cascade dynamics. Finally, both linear and nonlinear indices of postural sway also govern the relative strength of crossover or of linear decay, suggesting that tempering of non-Gaussianity across log-timescale is a function of both extrinsic constraints and endogenous postural control. These results provide new evidence that cascading interactions across longer-timescales supporting postural corrections can even recruit shorter-timescale processes with novel task constraints that can destabilize posture.",

Here, we used the synthetically developed minimal cell Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-Syn3B to examine essential mechanisms of antibiotic survival. The minimal cell contains only 473 genes, and most genes are essential. Its reduced complexity helps to reveal hidden phenomenon and fundamental biological principles can be explored because of less redundancy and feedback between systems compared to natural cells. We found that Syn3B evolves antibiotic resistance to different types of antibiotics expeditiously. The minimal cell also tolerates and persists against multiple antibiotics. It contains a few already identified persister-related genes, although lacking many systems previously linked to persistence (e.g. toxin-antitoxin systems, ribosome hibernation genes, etc.).",

    "abstract": "Colour polymorphisms are popular study systems among biologists interested in evolutionary dynamics, genomics, sexual selection and sexual conflict. In many damselfly groups, such as in the globally distributed genus Ischnura (forktails), sex-limited female colour polymorphisms occur in multiple species. Female-polymorphic species contain two or three female morphs, one of which phenotypically matches the male (androchrome or male mimic) and the other(s) which are phenotypically distinct from the male (heterochrome). These female colour polymorphisms are thought to be maintained by frequency-dependent sexual conflict, but their macroevolutionary histories are unknown, due to the lack of a robust molecular phylogeny. Here, we present the first time-calibrated phylogeny of Ischnura, using a multispecies coalescent approach (StarBEAST2) and incorporating both molecular and fossil data for 41 extant species (55% of the genus). We estimate the age of Ischnura to be between 13.8 and 23.4 millions of years, i.e. Miocene. We infer the ancestral state of this genus as female monomorphism with heterochrome females, with multiple gains and losses of female polymorphisms, evidence of trans-species female polymorphisms and a significant positive relationship between female polymorphism incidence and current geographic range size. Our study provides a robust phylogenetic framework for future research on the dynamic macroevolutionary history of this clade with its extraordinary diversity of sex-limited female polymorphisms.",

    "abstract": "1Balancing selection is an important adaptive mechanism underpinning a wide range of phenotypes. Despite its relevance, the detection of recent balancing selection from genomic data is challenging as its signatures are qualitatively similar to those left by ongoing positive selection. In this study we developed and implemented two deep neural networks and tested their performance to predict loci under recent selection, either due to balancing selection or incomplete sweep, from population genomic data. Specifically, we generated forward-in-time simulations to train and test an artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). ANN received as input multiple summary statistics calculated on the locus of interest, while CNN was applied directly on the matrix of haplotypes. We found that both architectures have high accuracy to identify loci under recent selection. CNN generally outperformed ANN to distinguish between signals of balancing selection and incomplete sweep and was less affected by incorrect training data. We deployed both trained networks on neutral genomic regions in European populations and demonstrated a lower false positive rate for CNN than ANN. We finally deployed CNN within the MEFV gene region and identified several common variants predicted to be under incomplete sweep in a European population. Notably, two of these variants are functional changes and could modulate susceptibility to Familial Mediterranean Fever, possibly as a consequence of past adaptation to pathogens. In conclusion, deep neural networks were able to characterise signals of selection on intermediate-frequency variants, an analysis currently inaccessible by commonly used strategies.",

We quantify a fingerprint of healthy dynamics quantifying the richness of the dynamical repertoire at each spatiotemporal scale by computing the entropy of switching activity between whole-brain functional networks.

    "abstract": "We previously identified a deletion on chromosome 16p12.1 that is mostly inherited and associated with multiple neurodevelopmental outcomes, where severely affected probands carried an excess of rare pathogenic variants compared to mildly affected carrier parents. We hypothesized that the 16p12.1 deletion sensitizes the genome for disease, while \"second-hits\" in the genetic background modulate the phenotypic trajectory. To test this model, we examined how neurodevelopmental defects conferred by knockdown of individual 16p12.1 homologs are modulated by simultaneous knockdown of homologs of \"second-hit\" genes in Drosophila melanogaster and Xenopus laevis. We observed that knockdown of 16p12.1 homologs affect multiple phenotypic domains, leading to delayed developmental timing, seizure susceptibility, brain alterations, abnormal dendrite and axonal morphology, and cellular proliferation defects. Compared to genes within the 16p11.2 deletion, which has higher de novo occurrence, 16p12.1 homologs were less likely to interact with each other in Drosophila models or a human brain-specific interaction network, suggesting that interactions with \"second-hit\" genes may confer higher impact towards neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Assessment of 212 pairwise interactions in Drosophila between 16p12.1 homologs and 76 homologs of patient-specific \"second-hit\" genes (such as ARID1B and CACNA1A), genes within neurodevelopmental pathways (such as PTEN and UBE3A), and transcriptomic targets (such as DSCAM and TRRAP) identified genetic interactions in 63% of the tested pairs. In 11 out of 15 families, homologs of patient-specific \"second-hits\" enhanced or suppressed the phenotypic effects of one or many 16p12.1 homologs. In fact, homologs of SETD5 synergistically interacted with homologs of MOSMO in both Drosophila and X. laevis, leading to modified cellular and brain phenotypes, as well as axon outgrowth defects that were not observed with knockdown of either individual homolog. Our results suggest that several 16p12.1 genes sensitize the genome towards neurodevelopmental defects, and complex interactions with \"second-hit\" genes determine the ultimate phenotypic manifestation.\n\nAuthor SummaryCopy-number variants, or deletions and duplications in the genome, are associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. The developmental delay-associated 16p12.1 deletion is mostly inherited, and severely affected children carry an excess of \"second-hits\" variants compared to mildly affected carrier parents, suggesting that additional variants modulate the clinical manifestation. We studied this \"two-hit\" model using Drosophila and Xenopus laevis, and systematically tested how homologs of \"second-hit\" genes modulate neurodevelopmental defects observed for 16p12.1 homologs. We observed that 16p12.1 homologs independently led to multiple neurodevelopmental features and weakly interacted with each other, suggesting that interactions with \"second-hit\" homologs potentially have a higher impact towards neurodevelopmental defects than interactions between 16p12.1 homologs. We tested 212 pairwise interactions of 16p12.1 homologs with \"second-hit\" homologs and genes within conserved neurodevelopmental pathways, and observed modulation of neurodevelopmental defects caused by 16p12.1 homologs in 11 out of 15 families, and 16/32 of these changes could be attributed to genetic interactions. Interestingly, we observed that SETD5 homologs interacted with homologs of MOSMO, which conferred additional neuronal phenotypes not observed with knockdown of individual homologs. We propose that the 16p12.1 deletion sensitizes the genome to multiple neurodevelopmental defects, and complex interactions with \"second-hit\" genes determine the clinical trajectory of the disorder.",

Ensemble fusion calling techniques appear promising; however, current options have limited accessibility and function.\n\nResultsMetaFusion is a flexible meta-calling tool that amalgamates outputs from any number of fusion callers. Individual caller results are standardized by conversion into the new file type Common Fusion Format (CFF). Calls are annotated, merged using graph clustering, filtered, and ranked to provide a final output of high confidence candidates. MetaFusion consistently achieves higher precision and recall than individual callers on real and simulated datasets, and reaches up to 100% precision, indicating that ensemble calling is imperative for high confidence results. MetaFusion uses FusionAnnotator to annotate calls with information from cancer fusion databases, and is provided with a benchmarking toolkit to calibrate new callers.\n\nAvailabilityMetaFusion is freely available at https://github.com/ccmbioinfo/MetaFusion\n\nContactarun.ramani@sickkids.ca\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "The stock market is a bellwether of socio-economic changes that may directly affect individual well-being. Using large-scale UK-biobank data generated over 14 years, we applied specification curve analysis to rigorously identify significant associations between the local stock market index (FTSE100) and 479,791 UK residents mood, as well as their alcohol intake and blood pressure adjusting the results for a large number of potential confounders, including age, sex, linear and non-linear effects of time, research site, other stock market indexes. Furthermore, we found similar associations between FTSE100 and volumetric measures of affective brain regions in a subsample (n=39,755; measurements performed over 5.5 years), which were particularly strong around phase transitions characterized by maximum volatility in the market. The main findings did not depend on applied effect-size estimation criteria (linear methods or mutual information criterion) and were replicated in two independent US-based studies (Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative; n=424; performed over 2,5 years and MyConnectome; n=1; 81 measurements over 1,5 years). Our results suggest that phase transitions in the society, indexed by stock market, exhibit close relationships with human mood, health and the affective brain from an individual to population level.",

    "abstract": "We take a data-driven approach to deducing the local volume changes accompanying early development of the fetal human brain. Our approach uses fetal brain atlas MRI data for the geometric changes in representative cases. Using a nonlinear continuum mechanics model of morphoelastic growth, we invert the deformation obtained from MRI registration to arrive at a field for the growth deformation gradient tensor. Our field inversion uses a combination of direct and adjoint methods for computing gradients of the objective function while constraining the optimization by the physics of morphoelastic growth. We thus infer a growth deformation gradient field that obeys the laws of morphoelastic growth. The errors between the MRI data and the forward displacement solution driven by the inverted growth deformation gradient field are found to be smaller than the reference displacement by well over an order of magnitude, and can be driven even lower. The results thus reproduce the three-dimensional growth during the early development of the fetal brain with controllable error. Our findings confirm that early growth is dominated by in plane cortical expansion rather than thickness increase.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel, fully three-dimensional approach to soft material characterization and constitutive modeling with relevance to soft biological tissue. Our approach leverages recent advances in experimental techniques and data-driven computation. The experimental component of this approach involves in situ mechanical loading in a magnetic field (using MRI), yielding the entire deformation tensor field throughout the specimen regardless of the possible irregularities in its three-dimensional shape. Characterization can therefore be accomplished with data at a reduced number of deformation states. We refer to this experimental technique as MR-u. Its combination with powerful approaches to inverse modelling, specifically methods of model inference, would open the door to insightful mechanical characterization for soft materials. In recent computational advances that answer this need, we have developed new, data-driven inverse techniques to infer the model that best explains the physics governing observed phenomena from a spectrum of admissible ones, while maintaining parsimony of representation. This approach is referred to as Variational System Identification (VSI). In this communication, we apply the MR-u approach to characterize soft polymers regarding them as surrogates of soft biological tissue, and using VSI, we infer the physically best-suited and parsimonious mathematical models of their mechanical response. We demonstrate the performance of our methods in the face of noisy data with physical constraints that challenge the identification of mathematical models, while attaining high accuracy in the predicted response of the inferred models.",

We detected 35,638 VNTR loci and classified 5,676 as commonly polymorphic (i.e., with non-reference alleles occurring in >5% of the population). Commonly polymorphic VNTR loci were found to be enriched in genomic regions with regulatory function, i.e., transcription start sites and enhancers. Investigation of the commonly polymorphic VNTRs in the context of population ancestry revealed that 1,096 loci contained population-specific alleles and that those could be used to classify individuals into super-populations with near-perfect accuracy. Search for quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), among the VNTRs proximal to genes, indicated that in 187 genes expression differences correlated with VNTR genotype. We validated our predictions in several ways, including experimentally, through the identification of predicted alleles in long reads, and by comparisons showing consistency between sequencing platforms.

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeUp to two-thirds of stroke survivors experience persistent sensorimotor impairments. Recovery relies on the integrity of spared brain areas to compensate for damaged tissue. Subcortical regions play critical roles in the control and regulation of sensorimotor circuits. The goal of this work is to identify associations between volumes of spared subcortical nuclei and sensorimotor behavior at different timepoints after stroke.\n\nMethodsWe pooled high-resolution T1-weighted MRI brain scans and behavioral data in 828 individuals with unilateral stroke from 28 cohorts worldwide. Cross-sectional analyses using linear mixed-effects models related post-stroke sensorimotor behavior to non-lesioned subcortical volumes (Bonferroni-corrected, p<0.004). We tested subacute ([&le;]90 days) and chronic ([&ge;]180 days) stroke subgroups separately, with exploratory analyses in early stroke ([&le;]21 days) and across all time. Sub-analyses in chronic stroke were also performed based on class of sensorimotor deficits (impairment, activity limitations) and side of lesioned hemisphere.\n\nResultsWorse sensorimotor behavior was associated with a smaller ipsilesional thalamic volume in both early (n=179; d=0.68) and subacute (n=274, d=0.46) stroke. In chronic stroke (n=404), worse sensorimotor behavior was associated with smaller ipsilesional putamen (d=0.52) and nucleus accumbens (d=0.39) volumes, and a larger ipsilesional lateral ventricle (d=-0.42). Worse chronic sensorimotor impairment specifically (measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment; n=256) was associated with smaller ipsilesional putamen (d=0.72) and larger lateral ventricle (d=-0.41) volumes, while several measures of activity limitations (n=116) showed no significant relationships. In the full cohort across all time (n=828), sensorimotor behavior was associated with the volumes of the ipsilesional nucleus accumbens (d=0.23), putamen (d=0.33), thalamus (d=0.33), and lateral ventricle (d=-0.23).\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate significant relationships between post-stroke sensorimotor behavior and reduced volumes of subcortical gray matter structures that were spared by stroke, which differ by time and class of sensorimotor measure. These findings may provide additional targets for improving post-stroke sensorimotor outcomes.",

    "abstract": "When presented with complex rhythmic auditory stimuli, humans are able to track underlying temporal structure (e.g., a \"beat\"), both covertly and with their movements. This capacity goes far beyond that of a simple entrained oscillator, drawing on contextual and enculturated timing expectations and adjusting rapidly to perturbations in event timing, phase, and tempo. Previous modeling work has described how entrainment to rhythms may be shaped by event timing expectations, but sheds little light on any underlying computational principles that could unify the phenomenon of expectation-based entrainment with other brain processes. Inspired by the predictive processing framework, we propose that the problem of rhythm tracking is naturally characterized as a problem of continuously estimating an underlying phase and tempo based on precise event times and their correspondence to timing expectations. We present two inference problems formalizing this insight: PIPPET (Phase Inference from Point Process Event Timing) and PATIPPET (Phase and Tempo Inference). Variational solutions to these inference problems resemble previous \"Dynamic Attending\" models of perceptual entrainment, but introduce new terms representing the dynamics of uncertainty and the influence of expectations in the absence of sensory events. These terms allow us to model multiple characteristics of covert and motor human rhythm tracking not addressed by other models, including sensitivity of error corrections to inter-event interval and perceived tempo changes induced by event omissions. We show that positing these novel influences in human entrainment yields a range of testable behavioral predictions. Guided by recent neurophysiological observations, we attempt to align the phase inference framework with a specific brain implementation. We also explore the potential of this normative framework to guide the interpretation of experimental data and serve as building blocks for even richer predictive processing and active inference models of timing.",

Celda can quantify the probabilistic contribution of each gene to each module, each module to each cell population, and each cell population to each sample. We used Celda to identify transcriptional modules and cell subpopulations in a publicly available peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) dataset. Celda identified a population of proliferating T cells and a single plasma cell which were missed by two other clustering methods. Celda identified transcriptional modules that highlighted unique and shared biological programs across cell types. Celda also outperformed a PCA-based approach for gene clustering on simulated data. Overall, Celda presents a novel statistically principled approach towards characterizing transcriptional programs and cellular heterogeneity in single-cell RNA-seq data.",

Our normative theory posits an important role for the notion of neuronal cell types and local diffusive communication by enabling biologically plausible and efficient weight update. While obeying fundamental biological constraints, including separating excitatory vs inhibitory cell types and observing connection sparsity, we trained RSNNs for temporal credit assignment tasks spanning seconds and observed that the inclusion of local modulatory signaling improved learning efficiency. Our learning rule puts forth a novel form of interaction between modulatory signals and synaptic transmission.

Here, we tested whether memory fidelity of long-term object-location binding may be a sensitive marker even among cognitively healthy individuals in their mid-60s by comparing participants at low and higher risk based on presence of the {varepsilon}4-allele of the apolipoprotein gene (n=26 {varepsilon}3{varepsilon}3, n=20 {varepsilon}3{varepsilon}4 carriers). We used a continuous report paradigm in a visual memory task that required participants to recreate the spatial position of objects in a scene. We employed mixture modelling to estimate the two distinct memory processes that underpin the trial-by-trial variation in localisation errors: retrieval success which indexes the proportion of trials where participants recalled any information about an objects position and the precision with which participants retrieved this information. Prior work has shown that these memory paradigms that separate retrieval success from precision are capable of detecting subtle differences in mnemonic fidelity even when retrieval success could not. Nonetheless, a Bayesian analysis found good evidence that {varepsilon}3{varepsilon}4 carriers did not remember fewer object locations (F(1, 42)=.450, p=.506, BF01 =3.02), nor was their precision for the spatial position of objects reduced compared to {varepsilon}3{varepsilon}3 carriers (F(1, 42)=.12, p=.726, BF01 =3.19). Because the participants in the sample presented here were a subset of a study on APOE effects on spatial navigation in the Sea Hero Quest game (Coughlan et al., 2019. PNAS, 116(9)), we obtained these data to contrast APOE effects on the two tasks within the same sample (n=33). Despite the smaller sample size, wayfinding deficits among {varepsilon}3{varepsilon}4 could be replicated (F(1, 33) =5.60, p=.024, BF10 =3.44). Object-location memory metrics and spatial navigation scores were not correlated (all r<.25, p>.1, 0<BF10 <3). These findings show spared object-location binding in the presence of a detrimental APOE {varepsilon}4 effect on spatial navigation. This suggests that the sensitivity of memory fidelity and binding tasks may not extend to individuals with one {varepsilon}4-allele in their early to mid-60s. The results provide further support to prior proposals that spatial navigation may be a sensitive marker for the earliest AD-dependent cognitive changes, even before episodic memory.",

    "abstract": "Aortic diameter is a standard parameter for defining disease severity of thoracic aortic aneurysms. In mouse studies, aortic diameters can be measured in situ directly, but this approach has a potential confounder of underestimation due to the absence of physiological arterial blood pressure. In the present study, we developed an in situ approach for authentic aortic measurements. Thoracic aortic aneurysms were induced by beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN, 0.5% wt/vol) administration in 4-week-old male C57BL/6J mice. Ultrasonography was performed to examine aortic dimensions, and mice with thoracic aortic dilatations were terminated subsequently. After saline perfusion through the left ventricle, periaortic tissues were removed to expose thoracic aortas. Optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound was injected via the left ventricle to maintain aortic patency. In situ aortic images were captured pre- and post-OCT injection. In mice with severe thoracic aortic aneurysms, smaller aortic diameters were observed prior to OCT injection compared to ultrasound measurements, while aortic diameters in situ after OCT were comparable to diameters measured using ultrasound. A telemetry system demonstrated that maximal luminal pressures during 150 ul of OCT injection were 90 mmHg. Immunostaining for CD31 revealed that endothelial cells were preserved in the intima after OCT injection. These results indicate that OCT injection does not cause aortic damages due to excess pressures. In conclusion, in situ imaging with OCT injection provides authentic aortic measurements without overt aortic damage in mice with thoracic aortic aneurysms.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes play active roles at synapses and can monitor, respond, and adapt to local synaptic activity. To investigate this relationship, more tools that can selectively activate native G protein signaling pathways in astrocytes with both spatial and temporal precision are needed. Here, we tested AAV8-GFAP-Opto1AR-eYFP (Opto1AR), a viral vector to enable activation of Gq signaling in astrocytes via light-sensitive 1-adrenergic receptors. To determine if stimulating astrocytic Opto1AR modulates hippocampal synaptic transmission, recordings were made in CA1 pyramidal cells with surrounding astrocytes expressing Opto1AR, channelrhodopsin (ChR2), or GFP. Both high-frequency (20 Hz, 45-ms light pulses, 5 mW, 5 min) and low-frequency (0.5 Hz, 1-s pulses at increasing 1, 5, and 10 mW intensities, 90 s per intensity) blue light stimulation were tested. 20 Hz Opto1AR stimulation increased both inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic current (IPSC and EPSC) frequency, and the mIPSC effect was largely reversible within 20 min. By contrast, low-frequency stimulation of Opto1AR did not modulate either IPSCs or EPSCs, whereas the same stimulation of astrocytic ChR2 was effective. These data demonstrate that Opto1AR activation in astrocytes changes synaptic excitation and inhibition in a stimulation-sensitive manner, demonstrating the efficacy and utility of GFAP-Opto1AR as a tool in studying astrocyte-neuron interactions.",

    "abstract": "1Deaths related to opioid use have skyrocketed in the United States, leading to a public health epidemic. Research has shown that both biological (genes) and environmental (stress) precursors are linked to opioid use. In particular, stress during adolescence - a critical period of frontal lobe development - influences the likelihood of abusing drugs. However, little is known about the biological mechanisms through which adolescent stress leads to long-term risk of opioid use, or whether genetic background moderates this response. Male and female C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ mice were exposed to chronic variable social stress (CVSS) or control conditions throughout adolescence and then tested for morphine locomotor sensitization or morphine consumption in adulthood. To examine possible mechanisms that underlie stress-induced changes in morphine behaviors, we assessed physiological changes in response to acute stress exposure and prefrontal cortex miRNA gene expression. Adolescent stress did not influence morphine sensitization or consumption in BALB/cJ animals, and there was limited evidence of stress effects in female C57BL/6J mice. In contrast, male C57BL/6J mice exposed to adolescent CVSS had blunted morphine sensitization compared to control animals; no differences were observed in the acute locomotor response to morphine administration or morphine consumption. Physiologically, C57BL/6J mice exposed to CVSS had an attenuated corticosterone recovery following an acute stressor and downregulation of twelve miRNA in the prefrontal cortex compared to control mice. The specificity of the effects for C57BL/6J versus BALB/cJ mice provides evidence of a gene by environmental interaction influencing opioid behaviors. Long-term differences in stress reactivity or miRNA expression suggests two possible biological mechanisms to evaluate in future research.",

    "abstract": "We investigated how mangrove-island micro-elevation (i.e., habitat: center vs. edge) affects tree physiology in a scrub mangrove forest of the southeastern Everglades. We measured leaf gas exchange rates of scrub Rhizophora mangle L. trees monthly during 2019, hypothesizing that CO2 assimilation (Anet) and stomatal conductance (gsw) would decline with increasing water levels and salinity, expecting more-considerable differences at mangrove-island edges than centers, where physiological stress is greatest. Water levels varied between 0 and 60 cm from the soil surface, rising during the wet season (May-October) relative to the dry season (November-April). Porewater salinity ranged from 15 to 30 ppt, being higher at mangrove-island edges than centers. Anet maximized at 15.1 {micro}mol m-2 s-1, and gsw was typically <0.2 mol m-2 s-1, both of which were greater in the dry than the wet season and greater at island centers than edges, with seasonal variability being roughly equal to variation between habitats. After accounting for season and habitat, water level positively affected Anet in both seasons but did not affect gsw. Our findings suggest that inundation stress (i.e., water level) is the primary driver of variation in leaf gas exchange rates of scrub mangroves in the Florida Everglades, while also constraining Anet more than gsw. The interaction between inundation stress due to permanent flooding and habitat varies with season as physiological stress is alleviated at higher-elevation mangrove-island center habitats during the dry season. Freshwater inflows during the wet season, increase water levels and inundation stress at higher-elevation mangrove-island centers, but also potentially alleviate salt and sulfide stress in soils. Thus, habitat heterogeneity leads to differences in nutrient and water acquisition and use between trees growing in island centers versus edges, creating distinct physiological controls on photosynthesis, which likely affect carbon flux dynamics of scrub mangroves in the Everglades.",

    "abstract": "Gene body methylation (GBM) is an ancestral aspect of DNA methylation (Sarda, Zeng, Hunt, & Yi, 2012; Yi, 2012; Zemach, McDaniel, Silva, & Zilberman, 2010) whose role in development has been obscured by the more prominent roles of promoter and CpG island methylation. The wasp Nasonia has little promoter and CpG island methylation, yet retains strong GBM (Park et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Werren et al., 2010), making it an excellent model for elucidating the role of GBM. Here we show that Nasonia DNA methyl transferase 1a (Nv-Dnmt1a) knockdown leads to failures in cellularization and gastrulation of the embryo. Both of these disrupted events are hallmarks of the maternal-zygotic transition (MZT) in insects. Analysis of the embryonic transcriptome and methylome revealed strong reduction of GBM and widespread disruption of gene expression during embryogenesis after Nv-Dnmt1a knockdown. There was a strong correlation between loss of GBM and reduced gene expression in thousands of methylated loci, while affected unmethylated genes tended to be upregulated. We propose that reduced GBM and subsequent lower expression levels of methylated genes was the direct effect of Nv-Dnmt1 knockdown, and that this disruption led to widespread downstream dysregulation of MZT, and manifesting in developmental failure at gastrulation.\n\nSignificance StatementThe importance of gene-body methylation (GBM) in development is unclear, due to the difficulty in teasing apart the effects of cis-regulatory methylation from those of GBM in vertebrate model systems. Unlike vertebrate models, the methylation machinery in the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis appears to exclusively mediate GBM, thus simplifying interpretation of the role of GBM in development. Knockdown of DNMT1 (Nv-Dnmt1a) in Nasonia leads to embryonic lethality, which we show is caused by a failure of cellularization and gastrulation. Nv-Dnmt1a knockdown resulted in a global loss of GBM in the embryo, which was strongly correlated with a down-regulation of gene expression. We propose that GBM facilitated by Nv-Dnmt1a is required for proper zygotic genome activation in the wasp.",

    "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells play critical roles in physiologic and pathologic conditions such as pregnancy, infection, autoimmune disease and cancer. In cancer, numerous strategies have been designed to exploit the cytolytic properties of NK cells, with variable success. A major hurdle to NK-cell focused therapies is NK cell recruitment to and infiltration into tumors. While the chemotaxis pathways regulating NK recruitment to different tissues are well delineated, the mechanisms human NK cells employ to physically migrate are ill-defined. We show for the first time that human NK cells express fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a cell surface protease previously thought to be primarily expressed by activated fibroblasts. FAP degrades the extracellular matrix to facilitate cell migration and tissue remodeling. We used novel in vivo zebrafish and in vitro 3D culture models to demonstrate that FAP regulates NK cell migration, extravasation, and infiltration into tumors, ultimately affecting tumor cell lysis. These findings demonstrate the necessity of proteolytic migration in NK cell function, suggest novel mechanisms of action of FAP targeting drugs, and provide an entirely new way to regulate NK cell activity.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=129 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/429622v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9b2025org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5b5e79org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@976566org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18230c5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is an essential guild of many forested ecosystems and has a dynamic evolutionary history across kingdom Fungi, having independently evolved from diverse types of saprotrophic ancestors. In this study, we seek to identify genomic features of the transition to the ectomycorrhizal habit within the Russulaceae, one of the most diverse lineages of ectomycorrhizal fungi. We present comparative analyses of the pangenome and gene repertoires of 21 species across the order Russulales, including a closely related saprotrophic member of Russulaceae. The ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae is inferred to have originated around the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event (73.6-60.1 million years ago (MY)). The genomes of the ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae are characterized by a loss of genes for plant cell-wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs), an expansion of genome size through increased transposable element (TE) content, a reduction in secondary metabolism clusters, and an association of genes coding for certain secreted proteins with TE \"nests\". The saprotrophic sister group of the ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae, Gloeopeniophorella convolvens, possesses some of these aspects (e.g., loss of some PCWDE and protease orthologs, TE expansion, reduction in secondary metabolism clusters), resulting from an accelerated rate of gene evolution in the shared ancestor of Russulaceae that predates the evolution of the ectomycorrhizal habit. Genomes of Russulaceae possess a high degree of synteny, including a conserved set of terpene secondary metabolite gene clusters. We hypothesize that the evolution of the ectomycorrhizal habit requires premodification of the genome for plant root association followed by an accelerated rate of gene evolution within the secretome for host-defense circumvention and symbiosis establishment.",

We previously demonstrated that eliminating the activity of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) significantly impaired the effectiveness of autoreactive CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). However, the molecular mechanisms impacting CTL function remain unknown. Here, we studied the role of NOX2 in both non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse and human CTL function. Genetic ablation or chemical inhibition of NOX2 in CTL significantly suppressed activation-induced expression of the transcription factor T-bet, the master transcription factor of the Tc1 cell lineage, and T-bet target effectors genes such as IFN{gamma} and granzyme B. Inhibition of NOX2 in both human and mouse CTL prevented target cell lysis. We identified that superoxide generated by NOX2 must be converted into hydrogen peroxide to transduce the redox signal in CTL. Further, we show that NOX2-generated oxidants deactivate the Tumor Suppressor Complex leading to mTOR complex 1 activation and CTL effector function. These results indicate that NOX2 plays a non-redundant role in T cell receptor-mediated CTL effector function.",

Mutation of the Nab2 human ortholog ZC3H14 gives rise to an autosomal recessive intellectual disability, but understanding of Nab2/ZC3H14 function in metazoan nervous systems is limited, in part because no comprehensive identification of metazoan Nab2/ZC3H14-associated RNA transcripts has yet been conducted. Moreover, many Nab2/ZC3H14 functional protein partnerships likely remain unidentified. Here we present evidence that Drosophila melanogaster Nab2 interacts with the RBP Ataxin-2 (Atx2), a neuronal translational regulator, and implicate these proteins in coordinate regulation of neuronal morphology and adult viability. We then present the first high-throughput identifications of Nab2- and Atx2-associated RNAs in Drosophila brain neurons using an RNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (RIP-Seq) approach. Critically, the RNA interactomes of each RBP overlap, and Nab2 exhibits high specificity in its RNA associations in neurons in vivo, associating with a small fraction of all polyadenylated RNAs. The identities of shared associated transcripts (e.g. drk, me31B, stai) and of transcripts specific to Nab2 or Atx2 (e.g. Arpc2, tea, respectively) promise insight into neuronal functions of and interactions between each RBP. Significantly, Nab2-associated RNAs are overrepresented for internal A-rich motifs, suggesting these sequences may partially mediate Nab2 target selection. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Nab2 opposingly regulates neuronal morphology and shares associated neuronal RNAs with Atx2, and that Drosophila Nab2 associates with a more specific subset of polyadenylated mRNAs than its polyadenosine affinity alone may suggest.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer patient stratification is mainly driven by tumour receptor status and histological grading and subtyping, with about twenty percent of patients for which absence of any actionable biomarkers results in no clear therapeutic intervention. Cancer cells within the same tumour have heterogeneous phenotypes and exhibit dynamic plasticity. However, how to evaluate such heterogeneity and its impact on outcome and drug response is still unclear. Here, we transcriptionally profiled 35,276 individual cells from 32 breast cancer cell lines covering all main breast cancer subtypes to yield a breast cancer cell line atlas. We found high degree of heterogeneity in the expression of clinically relevant biomarkers across individual cells within the same cell line; such heterogeneity is non-genetic and dynamic. We computationally mapped single cell transcriptional profiles of patients tumour biopsies to the atlas to determine their composition in terms of cell lines. Each tumour was found to be heterogenous and composed of multiple cell lines mostly, but not exclusively, of the same subtype. We then trained an algorithm on the atlas to determine cell line composition from bulk gene expression profiles of tumour biopsies, thus providing a novel approach to patient stratification. Finally, we linked results from large-scale in vitro drug screening1,2 to the single cell data to computationally predict responses to more than 450 anticancer agents starting from single-cell transcriptional profiles. We thus found that transcriptional heterogeneity enables cells with differential drug sensitivity to co-exist in the same population. Our work provides a unique resource and a novel framework to determine tumour heterogeneity and drug response in breast cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Methylation-based noninvasive molecular diagnostics are easy and feasible tools for the early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, many of them have the limitation of low sensitivity with some CRCs detection failed in clinical practice. In this study, the clinical and pathological characteristics, as well as molecular features of three methylator-groups, defined by the promoter methylation status of SDC2 and TFPI2, were investigated in order to improve the performance of CRC detection. The Illumina Infinium 450k Human DNA methylation data and clinical information of CRCs were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. CRC samples were divided into three groups, HH (dual-positive), HL (single positive) and LL (dual-negative) according to the methylation status of SDC2 and TFPI2 promoters. Differences in age, tumor location, microsatellite instable status and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were evaluated among the three groups and these findings were then confirmed in our inner CRC dataset. The combination of methylated SDC2 and TFPI2 showed a superior performance of distinguishing CRCs from normal controls than each alone. Samples of HL group were more often originated from left-side CRCs whereas very few of them were from right-side (P < 0.05). HH grouped CRCs showed a higher level of microsatellite instability and mutation load than other two groups (mean nonsynonymous mutations for HH/HL/LL: 10.55/3.91/7.02, P = 0.0055). All mutations of BRAF, one of the five typical CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) related genes, were found in HH group (HH/HL/LL: 51/0/0, P = 0.018). Also there was a significantly older patient age at the diagnosis in HH group. Gene expression analysis identified 37, 84 and 22 group-specific DEGs for HH, HL and LL, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that HH specific DEGs were mainly related to the regulation of transcription and other processes, while LL specific DEGs were enriched in the biological processes of extracellular matrix interaction and cell migration. The three defined mathylator groups showed great difference in tumor location, patient age, MSI and ECM biological process, which could facilitate the development of more effective biomarkers for CRC detection.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is a major cause of treatment failure in Acute Myeloid Leukemias (AML). To better characterize the mechanisms of chemoresistance, we first identified genes whose expression is dysregulated in AML cells resistant to daunorubicin (DNR) or cytarabine (Ara-C), the main drugs used for the induction therapy. The genes found activated are mostly linked to immune signaling and inflammation. Among them, we identified a strong up-regulation of the NOX2 NAPDH oxidase subunit genes (CYBB, CYBA, NCF1, NCF2, NCF4 and RAC2). The ensuing increase in NADPH oxidase activity, which is particularly strong in DNR-resistant cells, participates in the acquisition and/or maintenance of resistance to DNR. In addition, analyzing gp91phox (CYBB-encoded Nox2 catalytic sub-unit) expression at the surface of leukemic blasts from 74 patients at diagnosis showed that NOX2 is generally more expressed and active in leukemic cells from the FAB M4/M5 subtypes compared to FAB M0-M2 ones. Using a gene expression-based score we demonstrate that high NOX2 subunit genes expression is a marker of adverse prognosis, independent of the cytogenetic-based risk classification, in AML patients.",

Using multi-omic assessment of cisplatin responsive and resistant human bladder cancer cell lines and whole-genome CRISPR screens, we identified NPEPPS, the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase as a novel driver of cisplatin resistance. Volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) have been shown to directly import the majority of intracellular cisplatin. Here, we show that the mechanism of NPEPPS-mediated cisplatin resistance is by binding to VRACs and blocking the import of cisplatin into the cell. We show that NPEPPS depletion increased intracellular cisplatin and made cisplatin-resistant cells more responsive to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of NPEPPS in cisplatin-sensitive cells decreased intracellular cisplatin and resulted in increased treatment resistance. The same results also hold for carboplatin. Our findings describe the first mechanism by which VRACs can be targeted to control the import of cisplatin and carboplatin.",

This increases the burden of recessive disease in populations with high levels of consanguinity and has been heavily studied in some groups. However, there has been little investigation of the broader effect of consanguinity on patterns of genetic variation on a global scale. Here, we collect published genetic data and information about marriage practices from 396 worldwide populations and show that preference for cousin marriage has a detectable effect on the distribution of long ROH in these samples, increasing the expected number of ROH longer than 10Mb by a factor of 1.5 (P=2.3 x 10-4). Variation in marriage practice and consequent rates of consanguinity is therefore an important aspect of demographic history for the purposes of modeling human genetic variation. However, marriage practices explain a relatively small proportion of the variation in ROH distribution and consequently the ability to predict marriage practices from population genetic samples (for example of ancient populations) is limited.",

To improve the resolution and efficiency of metagenomic binning, BASALT (Binning Across a Series of AssembLies Toolkit), a novel binning toolkit was present in this study, which recovers, compares and optimizes metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs) across a series of assemblies from short-read, long-read or hybrid strategies. BASALT incorporates self-designed algorithms which automates the separation of redundant bins, elongate and refine best bins and improve contiguity. Evaluation using mock communities revealed that BASALT auto-binning obtained up to 51% more number of MAGs with up to 10 times better MAG quality from microbial community at low (132 genomes) and medium (596 genomes) complexity, compared to other binners such as DASTool, VAMB and metaWRAP. Using BASALT, a case-study analysis of a Salt Lake sediment microbial community from northwest arid region of China was performed, resulting in 426 non-redundant MAGs, including 352 and 69 bacterial and archaeal MAGs which could not be assigned to any known species from GTDB (ANI < 95%), respectively. In addition, two Lokiarchaeotal MAGs that belong to superphylum Asgardarchaeota were observed from Salt Lake sediment samples. This is the first time that candidate species from phylum Lokiarchaeota was found in the arid and deep-inland environment, filling the current knowledge gap of earth microbiome. Overall, BASALT is proven to be a robust toolkit for metagenomic binning, and more importantly, expand the Tree of Life.",

We find that a CFAP61 splice variant, c.143+5G>A, causes exon skipping in human, inducing a multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) phenotype. We generated Cfap61 knockout mice that recapitulate the infertility phenotype of the human CFAP61 mutation, but without other symptoms usually observed in PCD. We find that CFAP61 interacts with the CSC, radial spoke stalk and RS head. During early stages of Cfap61-/- spermatid development, the assembly of RS components is impaired.

    "abstract": "Cellular heterogeneity in cancer is linked to disease progression and therapy response, although the mechanisms regulating distinct cellular states within tumours are not well understood. To address this, we identified melanin pigment content as a major source of phenotypic and functional heterogeneity in melanoma and compared RNAseq data from high (HPC) and low pigmented melanoma cells (LPC), revealing the polycomb repressor complex protein, EZH2, as a master regulator of these states. EZH2 protein, but not RNA expression, was found to be upregulated in LPCs and inversely correlated with melanin in pigmented patient melanomas. Surprisingly, conventional EZH2 methyltransferase inhibitors, GSK126 and EPZ6438, had no effect on LPC survival, clonogenicity and pigmentation, despite fully inhibiting methyltransferase activity. In contrast, EZH2 silencing by siRNA strategy or DZNep, MS1943 that reduces EZH2 protein levels, significantly inhibited cell growth in LPCs by hampering ribosome biogenesis. In addition, decline in EZH2 protein level induces pigmented cell phenotype by inducing melanin biosynthesis. Proteasomal inhibitor, MG132 treatment induced EZH2 protein levels in HPCs prompted us to look for differentially regulated ubiquitin system proteins in HPC vs LPCs. UBE2L6, E2 conjugating enzyme has been shown to be downregulated significantly in LPCs by UHRF1-mediated CpG methylation. Both biochemical assays and animal studies demonstrated that UBE2L6 expression decline, in turn, promotes EZH2 protein stability due to lack of ubiquitination on K381 residue in LPCs. UBR4 cooperates with UBE2L6 to facilitate this ubiquitination process. Targeting UHRF1/UBE2L6/UBR4 axis can be a better treatment option to trigger HPC state in melanoma in which conventional EZH2 inhibitors are ineffective.",

Simultaneous interference with their signalling pathways may improve muscle function, however little is known about their individual and combined receptor signalling. Here we show that inhibition of TGF-{beta} signalling by simultaneous muscle-specific knockout of TGF-{beta} type I receptors Tgfbr1 and Acvr1b simultaneously, induces substantial hypertrophy, while such effect does not occur by single receptor knockout. Hypertrophy is induced by increased phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K and reduced E3 ligases expression, while myonuclear number remains unaltered. Combined knockout of both TGF-{beta} type I receptors increases the number of satellite cells, macrophages and improves regeneration post cardiotoxin-induced injury by stimulating myogenic differentiation. Extra cellular matrix gene expression is exclusively elevated in muscle with combined receptor knockout. Tgfbr1 and Acvr1b are synergistically involved in regulation of myofibre size, regeneration and collagen deposition.",

    "abstract": "Auxin plays a dual role in growth regulation and, depending on the tissue and concentration of the hormone, it can either promote or inhibit division and expansion processes in plants. Recent studies revealed that, beyond transcriptional reprogramming, alternative auxin-controlled mechanisms regulate root growth. Here, we explored the impact of different auxin concentrations on the root tip proteome and phosphoproteome, generating a unique resource. From the phosphoproteome data we pinpointed (novel) growth regulators, such as the RALF34-THE1 module. Our results together with previously published studies suggest that auxin, H+-ATPases, cell wall modifications and cell wall sensing receptor-like kinases are tightly embedded in a pathway regulating cell elongation. Furthermore, our study assigned a novel role to MKK2 as a regulator of primary root growth and a (potential) regulator of auxin biosynthesis and signalling, and suggests the importance of the MKK2 Thr31 phosphorylation site for growth regulation in the Arabidopsis root tip.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYAn auxin-triggered Arabidopsis root tip (phospho)proteome reveals novel root growth regulators",

    "abstract": "Pectin methylesterases (PMEs) modify homogalacturonans (HG) chemistry and play a key role in regulating primary cell wall mechanical properties. How PME activity can fine-tune pectin structure in the growing plant has remained elusive. Here we report on the Arabidopsis AtPME2, which we found to be highly expressed during lateral root emergence and dark-grown hypocotyl elongation. We produced the mature active enzyme using heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris and characterized it through the use of a generic plant PME antiserum suitable for detecting recombinant and native enzyme independent of species source. At neutral pH AtPME2 is preferentially active on pectins with a degree of 55-70% methylesterification and can be inhibited by PME inhibitor protein (PMEI). We show that the mode of action for AtPME2 can switch from full processivity (at pH 8), creating large blocks of unmethylated galacturonic acid, to low processivity (at pH 5) and relate these observations to the differences in electrostatic potential of the protein at acidic and alkaline pH. To assess the role of AtPME2 in development, we characterized two knock-out lines. We show that in the context of acidified apoplast, low-processive demethylesterification by AtPME2 can loosen the cell wall, with consequent increase in cell elongation and etiolated hypocotyl length. Our study brings insights into how the pH-dependent regulation by PME activity could affect pectin structure and associated cell wall mechanical properties in expansion.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe processivity of AtPME2, a pectin methylesterase that fine-tunes cell wall pectins is modulated by pH in vitro and impacts the mechanical properties of the wall, affecting development in planta.",

We effortlessly generalise prior knowledge to solve novel problems, abstracting common structure and mapping it onto new sensorimotor specifics. Here we trained mice on a series of reversal learning problems that shared the same structure but had different physical implementations. Performance improved across problems, demonstrating transfer of knowledge. Neurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) maintained similar representations across multiple problems, despite their different sensorimotor correlates, whereas hippocampal (dCA1) representations were more strongly influenced by the specifics of each problem. Critically, this was true both for representations of the events that comprised each trial, and those that integrated choices and outcomes over multiple trials to guide subjects decisions. These data suggest that PFC and hippocampus play complementary roles in generalisation of knowledge, with the former abstracting the common structure among related problems, and the latter mapping this structure onto the specifics of the current situation.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a frequent complication in patients with severe systemic infection resulting in acute brain dysfunction and incapacitating long-term sequelae. SAE includes delirium, premature death, post-traumatic stress disorder, and major long-term cognitive impairment. The underlying pathophysiology of SAE is largely unresolved and specific treatment options are missing. We induced the peritoneal contamination and infection (PCI) sepsis model in 769 mice and compared these with 259 control mice. We found that experimental sepsis causes synaptic pathology in the brain characterized by severely disordered synaptic plasticity with reduced long-term potentiation, changes in CA1 pyramidal neuron dendritic spines, and behavioral abnormalities indicating cognitive dysfunction. Using electrophysiology, we found reduced frequency of quantal and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents whereas amplitudes of miniature, spontaneous, and evoked excitatory currents were increased, pointing towards a homeostatic synaptic scaling mechanism. Corresponding to dysfunctional excitatory synaptic function we discovered downregulation of genes related to neuronal and synaptic signaling in the brain, including the gene for activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc/Arg3.1), members of the transcription-regulatory EGR gene family, and the gene for dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (Dusp6). At the protein level, ARC expression and MAP kinase signaling in the brain were affected. For targeted rescue of dysfunctional synaptic signaling and plasticity, we overexpressed ARC in the hippocampus by microinjection of an adeno-associated virus containing a neuron-specific plasmid of the ARC transgene. Hereby we achieved recovery of defective synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway and improvement of memory dysfunction. Using a different rescue paradigm, PCI mice were subjected to enriched environment providing multiple activating stimuli. Enriched environment led to restoration of disordered long-term potentiation and memory, thus demonstrating the potential for activity-induced improvement. Together, we identified synaptic pathomechanisms of SAE after severe systemic infection and provide a conceptual approach to treat SAE-related disease mechanisms which may be applicable to patients afflicted with SAE.",

In addition, we discuss the use and interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests on non-human samples.\n\nMethodsBetween November and December 2020, Norway rat oral swabs, feces and tissues from the sewer system of Antwerp were collected to be tested by RT-qPCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples were screened for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using a Luminex microsphere immunoassay (MIA). Samples considered positive were then checked for neutralizing antibodies using a conventional viral neutralization test (cVNT).\n\nResultsThe serum of 35 rats was tested by MIA showing 3 potentially positive sera that were later shown to be negative by cVNT. All tissue samples of 39 rats analyzed tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.\n\nConclusionThis is the first study that evaluates SARS-CoV-2 infection in urban rats. We can conclude that the sample of 39 rats had never been infected with SARS-CoV-2. We show that diagnostic serology tests can give misleading results when applied on non-human samples.

Here, we devised a long-read RNA (IsoSeq) sequencing approach to characterize the COVID-19 transcript landscape and expression of its [~]27 coding regions. Our analysis identified novel COVID-19 transcripts including a) a short [~]65-70 nt 5-UTR fused to various downstream ORFs encoding accessory proteins such as the envelope, ORF 8, and ORF 9 (nucleocapsid) proteins, that are relatively highly expressed, b) novel SNVs that are differentially expressed, whereby a subset are suggestive of partial RNA editing events, and c) SNVs at functional sites, whereby at least one is associated with a differentially expressed spike protein isoform. These previously uncharacterized COVID-19 isoforms, expressed genes, and gene variants were corroborated using ddPCR. Understanding this transcriptional complexity may help provide insight into the biology and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus (CoV) non-structural proteins (nsps) assemble to form the replication-transcription complex (RTC) responsible for viral RNA synthesis. nsp7 and nsp8 are important cofactors of the RTC, as they interact and regulate the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and other nsps. To date, no structure of full-length SARS-CoV-2 nsp7:nsp8 complex has been published. Current understanding of this complex is based on structures from truncated constructs or with missing electron densities and complexes from related CoV species with which SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 share upwards of 90% sequence identity. Despite available structures being solved using crystallography and cryo-EM representing detailed snapshots of the nsp7:nsp8 complex, it is evident that the complex has a high degree of structural plasticity. However, relatively little is known about the conformational dynamics of the complex and how it assembles to interact with other nsps. Here, the solution-based structural proteomic techniques, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), illuminate the structural dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 full-length nsp7:nsp8 complex. The results presented from the two techniques are complementary and validate the interaction surfaces identified from the published three-dimensional heterotetrameric crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 truncated nsp7:nsp8 complex. Furthermore, mapping of XL-MS data onto higher order complexes suggests that SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 do not assemble into a hexadecameric structure as implied by the SARS-CoV full-length nsp7:nsp8 crystal structure. Instead our results suggest that the nsp7:nsp8 heterotetramer can dissociate into a stable dimeric unit that might bind to nsp12 in the RTC without altering nsp7-nsp8 interactions.",

Robust binding and neutralizing antibody titers to the 501Y.V2 variant were detected and these binding antibodies showed high levels of cross-reactivity for the original variant, from the first wave.

Nevertheless, the molecular machinery involved in this process is poorly understood.\n\nHere, we identify Rab11a and Rab11b as regulators of calcium-induced lysosome exocytosis. Interestingly, Rab11-positive vesicles transiently interact with lysosomes at the cell periphery, indicating that this interaction is required for the last steps of lysosome exocytosis. Additionally, we found that the silencing of the exocyst subunit Sec15, a Rab11 effector, impairs lysosome exocytosis independently of the exocyst complex, suggesting that Sec15 acts together with Rab11 in the regulation of lysosome exocytosis. Furthermore, we show that Rab11 binds the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab3a (GRAB) and also Rab3a, which we described previously as a regulator of the positioning and exocytosis of lysosomes.\n\nThus, our studies suggest that Rab11-positive vesicles transport GRAB to activate Rab3a on lysosomes, establishing a Rab11-Rab3 cascade that is essential for lysosome exocytosis.",

Individual aneuploid cells can be eliminated from developing tissues by unknown mechanisms. Cells with ribosomal protein (Rp) gene mutations are also eliminated, by cell competition with normal cells. Because Rp genes are spread across the genome, their copy number is a marker for chromosome aberrations. Elimination of imaginal disc cells with irradiation-induced genome damage often required cell competition genes. When defined chromosome regions were deleted, segmentally-aneuploid cells were eliminated by the RpS12-Xrp1 cell competition pathway in an apoptosis- dependent manner when they differed from neighboring cells in Rp gene dose. Cells with normal doses of the Rp (and eIF2{gamma}) genes survived and differentiated adult tissues. Thus, cell competition, triggered by differences in Rp gene dose between cells, is a significant mechanism for the elimination of aneuploid somatic cells, likely to contribute to preventing cancer.",

    "abstract": "Blood malignancies arise from the dysregulation of haematopoiesis. The type of blood cell and the specific order of oncogenic events initiating abnormal growth ultimately determine the cancer subtype and subsequent clinical outcome. HOXA9 plays an important role in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) prognosis by promoting blood cell expansion and altering differentiation; however, the function of HOXA9 in other blood malignancies is still unclear. Here, we demonstrate the importance of this gene in chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and highlight the biological switch and prognosis marker properties of HOXA9 in AML and MPN. This binary switch function can explain the clinical stratification of these two blood disorders. First, we establish the ability of HOXA9 to stratify AML patients with distinct cellular and clinical outcomes. Then, through the use of a computational network model of MPN, we show that the self-activation of HOXA9 and its relationship to JAK2 and TET2 can explain the branching progression of JAK2/TET2 mutant MPN patients towards divergent clinical characteristics. Finally, we predict a connection between the RUNX1 and MYB genes and a suppressive role for the NOTCH pathway in MPN diseases.",

    "abstract": "Measles-containing vaccines (MCV), specifically vaccines against measles and rubella (MR), are extremely effective and critical for the eradication of measles and rubella diseases. In developed countries, vaccination rates are high and vaccines are readily available, but continued high prevalence of both diseases in developing countries and surges in measles deaths in recent years have highlighted the need to expand vaccination efforts. To meet demand for additional vaccines at a globally affordable price, it is highly desirable to streamline vaccine production thereby reducing cost and speeding up time to delivery. MR vaccine characterization currently relies on the 50% cell culture infectious dose (CCID50) assay, an endpoint assay with low reproducibility that requires 10-14 days to complete. For streamlining bioprocess analysis and improving measurement precision relative to CCID50, we developed the VaxArray Measles and Rubella assay kit, which is based on a multiplexed microarray immunoassay with a 5-hour time to result. Here we demonstrate vaccine-relevant sensitivity ranging from 345 - 800 IFU/mL up to 100,000 IFU/mL and specificity that allows simultaneous analysis in bivalent vaccine samples. The assay is sensitive to antigen stability and has minimal interference from common vaccine additives. The assay exhibits high reproducibility and repeatability, with 15% CV, much lower than the typical 0.3 log10 error (~65%) observed for the CCID50 assay. The intact protein concentration measured by VaxArray is reasonably correlated to, but not equivalent to, CCID50 infectivity measurements for harvest samples. However, the measured protein concentration exhibits equivalency to CCID50 for more purified samples, including concentrated virus pools and monovalent bulks, making the assay a useful new tool for same-day analysis of vaccine samples for bioprocess development, optimization, and monitoring.",

    "abstract": "A novel inhibitor of PB1 import, referred to here as GM30, previously displayed nuclear retention of viral nucleoprotein (NP), which spurred the question of whether the compound directly or indirectly blocked viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex export. vRNPs are exported from the nucleus via exportin 1 (XPO1). Using verdinexor (VNXR), a direct inhibitor of vRNP export that binds to XPO1 and also blocks nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{kappa}B) export, we found that GM30 does not block nuclear export of NF-{kappa}B. GM30 likewise demonstrated high nuclear retention of NP but not as much as the direct inhibition of nuclear export by VNXR. When the compound was added hours after infection, the compound lost its ability to block nuclear export but VNXR retained its ability to block nuclear export. GM30 is therefore likely an indirect inhibitor of nuclear export because it disrupts the vRNP complex formation and impedes export from the nucleus by reducing nuclear import of PB1.",

    "abstract": "The peptidoglycan cell wall is a macromolecular structure that encases bacteria and is essential for their survival. Proper assembly of the cell wall requires peptidoglycan synthases as well as membrane-bound cleavage enzymes that control where new peptidoglycan is made and inserted. We are only beginning to understand the roles of peptidoglycan cleavage enzymes in cell wall assembly. Previous studies have shown that two membrane-bound proteins in Streptococcus pneumoniae, here named MpgA and MpgB, are important in maintaining cell wall integrity. MpgA was predicted to be a lytic transglycosylase based on its homology to Escherichia coli MltG while the enzymatic activity of MpgB was unclear. Using nascent peptidoglycan substrates synthesized in vitro from the peptidoglycan precursor Lipid II, we report that both MpgA and MpgB are muramidases. We show that replacing a single amino acid in E. coli MltG with the corresponding amino acid from MpgA results in muramidase activity, allowing us to predict from the presence of this amino acid that other putative lytic transglycosylases actually function as muramidases. Strikingly, we report that MpgA and MpgB cut nascent peptidoglycan at different positions along the sugar backbone relative to the reducing end. MpgA produces much longer peptidoglycan oligomers and we show that its cleavage site selectivity is controlled by the LysM-like subdomain, which is also present in MltG. We propose that MltGs ability to complement loss of MpgA in S. pneumoniae despite performing different cleavage chemistry is because it can cleave nascent peptidoglycan at the same distance from the lipid anchor.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics inhibit essential bacterial processes, resulting in arrest of growth and in some cases cell death. Many antibiotics are also reported to trigger endogenous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage DNA and other macromolecules. However, the type of DNA damage that arises and the mechanisms used by bacteria to repair it are largely unclear. We found that several different classes of antibiotic triggered dose-dependent DNA damage in Staphylococcus aureus, including some bacteriostatic drugs. Damage was heterogenous and varied in magnitude between strains. However, antibiotic-triggered DNA damage led to double strand breaks, the processing of which by the RexAB helicase/nuclease complex triggered the SOS response and reduced staphylococcal susceptibility to most of the antibacterials tested. In most cases, DNA DSBs occurred under aerobic but not anaerobic conditions, suggesting a role for ROS. We conclude that DNA double strand breaks are a common occurrence during bacterial exposure to several different antibiotic classes and that repair of this damage by the RexAB complex promotes bacterial survival.",

In bacteria their biosynthesis has been defined, however, the distribution of polyyne biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), and their evolutionary relationship to alkyne biosynthesis, have not been addressed. We explored the distribution of alkyne biosynthesis gene cassettes throughout bacteria, revealing evidence of multiple horizontal gene transfer events. Investigating the evolutionary connection between alkyne and polyyne biosynthesis identified a monophyletic clade possessing a conserved seven-gene cassette for polyyne biosynthesis. Mapping the diversity of these conserved genes revealed a phylogenetic clade representing a polyyne BGC in Pseudomonas, pgn, and subsequent pathway mutagenesis and analytical chemistry characterised the associated metabolite, protegencin. In addition to unifying and expanding our knowledge of polyyne diversity, our results show that alkyne and polyyne biosynthetic gene clusters are promiscuous within bacteria. Systematic mapping of conserved biosynthetic genes across bacterial genomic diversity has proven to be a successful method for discovering natural products.",

    "abstract": "Strict and facultative anaerobic bacteria are widely associated with both acute and chronic airway disease. However, their potential role(s) in disease pathophysiology remain poorly understood due to inherent limitations of existing models and conflicting oxygen demands between anaerobes and host cells. To overcome these limitations, we optimized a dual oxic-anoxic culture (DOAC) platform that maintains an oxygen-limited microenvironment at the epithelial interface while host cells are oxygenated basolaterally. This approach enables host-bacterial co-culture for [~]24h, and here we demonstrate its utility via two applications. First, we show that anaerobe challenge results in epithelial mucus degradation, inflammatory marker gene expression, and enhanced pathogen colonization. Second, we combine DOAC with single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to reveal a cell type-specific transcriptional response of the airway epithelium to anaerobe infection. Together, these data illustrate the versatility of DOAC while revealing new insights into anaerobe-host interactions and their mechanistic contributions to airway disease pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Andes virus (ANDV) nonlytically infects pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMECs) causing acute pulmonary edema termed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). In HPS patients virtually every PMEC is infected, however the mechanism by which ANDV induces vascular permeability and edema remains to be resolved. The ANDV nucleocapsid (N) protein activates the GTPase, RhoA, in primary human PMECs causing VE-Cadherin internalization from adherens junctions and PMEC permeability. We found that ANDV N protein failed to bind RhoA, but co-precipitates RhoGDI (Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor), the primary RhoA repressor that normally sequesters RhoA in an inactive state. ANDV N protein selectively binds the RhoGDI C-terminus (69-204) but fails to form ternary complexes with RhoA or inhibit RhoA binding to the RhoGDI N-terminus (1-69). However, we found that ANDV N protein uniquely inhibits RhoA binding to an S34D phosphomimetic RhoGDI mutant. Hypoxia and VEGF increase RhoA induced PMEC permeability by directing Protein Kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of S34 on RhoGDI. Collectively, ANDV N protein alone activates RhoA by sequestering and reducing RhoGDI available to suppress RhoA. In response to hypoxia and VEGF activated PKC, ANDV N protein additionally directs the release of RhoA from S34-phosphorylated RhoGDI, synergistically activating RhoA and PMEC permeability. These findings reveal a fundamental edemagenic mechanism that permits ANDV to amplify PMEC permeability in hypoxic HPS patients. Our results rationalize therapeutically targeting PKC and opposing Protein Kinase A (PKA) pathways that control RhoGDI phosphorylation as a means of resolving ANDV induced capillary permeability, edema and HPS.\n\nImportanceHPS causing hantaviruses infect pulmonary endothelial cells causing vascular leakage, pulmonary edema and a 35% fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Hantaviruses dont lyse or disrupt the endothelium but dysregulate normal EC barrier functions and increase hypoxia directed permeability. Our findings reveal a novel underlying mechanism of EC permeability resulting from ANDV N protein binding to RhoGDI, a regulatory protein that normally maintains edemagenic RhoA in an inactive state and inhibits EC permeability. ANDV N sequesters RhoGDI and enhances the release of RhoA from S34 phosphorylated RhoGDI. These findings indicate that ANDV N induces the release of RhoA from PKC phosphorylated RhoGDI, synergistically enhancing hypoxia directed RhoA activation and PMEC permeability. Our data suggests inhibiting PKC and activating PKA phosphorylation of RhoGDI as mechanisms of inhibiting ANDV directed EC permeability and therapeutically restricting edema in HPS patients. These findings may be broadly applicable to other causes of ARDS.",

Fungi can actively weather silicates to extract nutrients. However, it is unclear whether they are able to obtain the same amounts of nutrients and use the same mechanisms when tapping into different mineral sources. We performed a microcosm experiment using the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes Paxillus involutus and the silicates K-vermiculite, muscovite and phlogopite as only potassium sources, as they show a different resistance for the removal of K cations from the mineral structure. A combination of transcriptomic, elemental and SEM analyses showed that different minerals stimulated specific weathering mechanisms and led to a change in fungal genes expression. The differential expression of the fungal genes generated alternative chemical attacks on the minerals, resulting in a tailored dissolution and selective uptake of chemical elements according to the leachability of K from the silicate mineral. The K uptake capacity of the fungus was highest with vermiculite in comparison to growth on phlogopite and muscovite. The findings provide new insights into fungal-mineral interactions that will help to interpret key processes for the homeostasis of soil environments.",

It is capable of forming biofilms in vitro that result in an increase of already high levels of antibiotic resistance in this bacterium. Evidence that M. abscessus forms biofilm-like microcolonies in patient lungs and on medical devices further implicated the need to investigate this biofilm in detail. Therefore, in this study we characterized the M. abscessus pellicular biofilm, formed on a liquid-air interface, by studying its molecular composition, and its transcriptional profile in comparison to planktonic cells. Using scanning electron micrographs and fluorescence microscopy, we showed that M. abscessus biofilms produce an extracellular matrix composed of lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and eDNA. Transcriptomic analysis of biofilms revealed an upregulation of pathways involved in the glyoxylate shunt, redox metabolism and mycolic acid biosynthesis. Genes involved in elongation and desaturation of mycolic acids were highly upregulated in biofilms and, mirroring those findings, biochemical analysis of mycolates revealed molecular changes and an increase in mycolic acid chain length. Together these results give us an insight into the complex structure of M. abscessus biofilms, the understanding of which may be adapted for clinical use in treatment of biofilm infections, including strategies for dispersing the ECM, allowing antibiotics to gain access to bacteria within the biofilm.",

    "abstract": "Characterization of gene essentiality across different conditions is a useful approach for predicting gene function. Transposon sequencing (TnSeq) is a powerful means of generating genome-wide profiles of essentiality and has been used extensively in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) genetic research. Over the past two decades, dozens of TnSeq screens have been published, yielding valuable insights into the biology of Mtb in vitro, inside macrophages, and in model host organisms. However, these Mtb TnSeq profiles are distributed across dozens of research papers within supplementary materials, which makes querying them cumbersome and assembling a complete and consistent synthesis of existing data challenging. Here, we address this problem by building a central repository of publicly available TnSeq screens performed in M. tuberculosis, which we call the Mtb transposon sequencing database (MtbTnDB). The MtbTnDB encompasses 64 published and unpublished TnSeq screens, and is standardized, open-access, and allows users easy access to data, visualizations, and functional predictions through an interactive web-app (www.mtbtndb.app). We also present evidence that (i) genes in the same genomic neighborhood tend to have similar TnSeq profiles, and (ii) clusters of genes with similar TnSeq profiles tend to be enriched for genes belonging to the same functional categories. Finally, we test and evaluate machine learning models trained on TnSeq profiles to guide functional annotation of orphan genes in Mtb. In addition to facilitating the exploration of conditional genetic essentiality in this important human pathogen via a centralized TnSeq data repository, the MtbTnDB will enable hypothesis generation and the extraction of meaningful patterns by facilitating the comparison of datasets across conditions. This will provide a basis for insights into the functional organization of Mtb genes as well as gene function prediction.",

Despite potential impact of viruses in RA was mentioned in some studies, specific roles of oral and gut viromes in RA is still unclear.\n\nResultsIn this study, we observed the viral community variation in the oral and gut samples, performed a comparative analysis of oral and gut viromes in health controls, untreated and treated RA patients, and constructed interaction networks among viruses, bacteria, and RA-associated clinical indexes to address the potential associations between viral community and RA. The results showed that the viromes could be isolated from dental plaque, saliva, and feces samples, among which the saliva having the highest with in-sample diversity. Meanwhile, remarkable variations of viral diversity and composition in the oral (i.e., dental plaque and saliva) virome could be observed in RA patients and healthy controls yet in untreated and treated RA patients, with a relatively low variability in the gut virome. Distraction of viruses-bacteria interaction network was discovered in three sites of RA patients. In addition, some RA-associated oral taxa, including Lactococcus phage vOTU70, Bacteroides vulgatus, Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Neisseria elongate, were correlated to the RA-related clinical indexes.\n\nConclusionWhole-virome analysis illustrated the potential role of oral and gut viral communities in the development of RA.",

    "abstract": "Proximity labeling catalyzed by promiscuous enzymes, such as APEX2, has emerged as a powerful approach to characterize multiprotein complexes and protein-protein interactions. However, current methods depend on the expression of exogenous fusion proteins and cannot be applied to post-translational modifications. To address this limitation, we developed a new method to label proximal proteins of interest by antibody-mediated protein A-APEX2 labeling (AMAPEX). In this method, a modified protein is bound in situ by a specific antibody, which then tethers a protein A-APEX2 (pA-APEX2) fusion protein. Activation of APEX2 labels the nearby proteins with biotin; these proteins are then purified using streptavidin beads and are identified by mass spectrometry. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by profiling the binding proteins of histone modifications including H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H3K4me3, H4K5ac and H4K12ac, and we verified the genome-wide colocalization of these identified proteins with bait proteins by published ChIP-seq analysis. Overall, AMAPEX is an efficient tool to identify proteins that interact with modified proteins.",

    "abstract": "Degeneration and aging of the nucleus pulposus (NP) of the intervertebral disc (IVD) is accompanied by alterations in NP cell phenotype marked by a shift towards a fibroblast-like, catabolic state. We have recently demonstrated an ability to manipulate the phenotype of human adult degenerative NP cells through 2D culture upon poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) based hydrogels dually functionalized with integrin- and syndecan-binding laminin-mimetic peptides (LMPs). In the present study, we sought to understand the transcriptomic changes elicited through NP cell interactions with the LMP-functionalized hydrogel system (LMP gel) by examining targets of interest a priori and by conducting unbiased analysis to identify novel mechanosensitive targets. The results of gene specific analysis demonstrated that the LMP gel promoted adult degenerative NP cells to upregulate 148 genes including several NP markers (e.g. NOG and ITGA6) and downregulate 277 genes, namely several known fibroblastic markers. Additionally, 13 genes associated with G protein-coupled receptors, many of which are known drug targets, were identified as differentially regulated following culture upon the gel. Furthermore, through gene set enrichment analysis we identified over 700 pathways enriched amongst the up- and downregulated genes including pathways related to cell differentiation, notochord morphogenesis, and intracellular signaling. Together these findings demonstrate the global mechanobiological effects induced by the LMP gel and confirm the ability of this substrate to modulate NP cell phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are part of the most widespread fungal-plant symbiosis. They colonize at least 80% of plant species, promote plant growth and plant diversity. These fungi are multinucleated and contain either one or two haploid nuclear genotypes (monokaryon and dikaryon) identified by the alleles at a putative mating-type locus. This taxon has been considered as an ancient asexual scandal because of the lack of observable sexual structures. Despite identification of a putative mating-type locus and functional activation of genes related to mating when two isolates co-exist, it remains unknown if AMF take part in a mainly sexual life cycle.\n\nWe used publicly available genome sequences to test if dikaryon genomes display signatures of sexual reproduction in the form of reciprocal recombination patterns, or if they display signatures of parasexual reproduction involving gene conversion.\n\nWe used short-read and long-read sequence data to identify nucleus genotype-specific haplotypes within dikaryons and then compared them to orthologous gene sequences from related monokaryon isolates displaying the same putative MAT-types. We observed that these genotype-specific haplotypes display reciprocal recombination and not gene conversion.\n\nThese results are consistent with a sexual origin of the dikaryon rather than a parasexual origin and provides an important step to understand the life cycle of these globally important symbiotic fungi.",

    "abstract": "One of the key mechanisms employed by cells to control their spatiotemporal organization is the formation and dissolution of phase-separated condensates. The balance between condensate assembly and disassembly can be critically regulated by the presence of RNA. In this work, we use a novel sequence-dependent coarse-grained model for proteins and RNA to unravel the impact of RNA in modulating the transport properties and stability of biomolecular condensates. We explore the phase behavior of several RNA-binding proteins such as FUS, hnRNPA1 and TDP-43 proteins along with that of their corresponding prion-like domains and RNA-recognition motifs, from absence to moderately high RNA concentration. By characterising the phase diagram, key molecular interactions, surface tension and transport properties of the condensates, we report a dual RNA-induced behavior: On the one hand, RNA enhances phase separation at low concentration as long as the RNA radius of gyration is comparable to that of the proteins, whilst at high concentration it inhibits the ability of proteins to self-assemble independently of its length. On the other hand, along with the stability modulation, the viscosity of the condensates can be considerably reduced at high RNA concentration as long as the length of the RNA chains is shorter than that of the proteins. Conversely, long RNA strands increase viscosity, even at high concentration, but barely modify protein self-diffusion, which mainly depends on RNA concentration and on its own effect on droplet density. On the whole, our work rationalizes the different routes by which RNA can regulate phase separation and condensate dynamics, as well as the subsequent aberrant rigidification implicated in the emergence of various neuropathologies and age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "PIK3CA mutations are the most common in breast cancer, particularly in the estrogen receptor positive cohort, but the benefit of PI3K inhibitors has had limited success compared with approaches targeting other less common mutations. We found allelic imbalances in the expression of PIK3CA in normal breast tissue and mapped a germline candidate regulatory variant. An imbalance was also frequently observed in the expression of the missense mutant and wild-type PIK3CA alleles in breast tumors from METABRIC and TCGA projects. Moreover, although 60% of tumors preferentially expressed the mutant allele, 10% did preferentially express the wild-type allele. Mechanistically, we show that these imbalances are more frequently due to regulatory variants in cis than altered copy-number and predict that somatic variants have a more significant role than germline ones. We further found that imbalanced allelic expression between mutant and wild-type alleles due to cis-regulatory variants associated with poor prognosis (p=0.0081).\n\nInterestingly, ER+, PR+, and Her2- tumors expressing very low levels of the mutant allele had the poorest prognosis (DSS <7.5yrs for ER+ and PR+ tumors and <5yrs for Her2- tumors). Hence, our work provides compelling evidence to support the clinical utility of PIK3CA allelic expression in breast cancer in identifying this cohort of low mutant allele expressing patients of poorer prognosis, who will unlikely benefit from PI3K inhibitors. Furthermore, our work establishes a new model of differential regulation of critical cancer-promoting genes.",

Depletion of Nrf2 in {beta}-cells resulted in decreased glucose-stimulated {beta}-cell proliferation ex vivo and decreased adaptive {beta}-cell proliferation and {beta}-cell mass expansion after a high fat diet in vivo. Nrf2 protects {beta}-cells from apoptosis after a high fat diet. Nrf2 loss-of-function decreases Pdx1 abundance and insulin content. Activating Nrf2 in a {beta}-cell-specific manner increases {beta}-cell proliferation and {beta}-cell mass. Human islets transplanted under the kidney capsule of immunocompromised mice and treated systemically with CDDO-Me, an Nrf2 activator, display increased {beta}-cell proliferation.

    "abstract": "Natural Killer T (NKT) cells detect lipids presented by CD1d. Most studies focus on type I NKT cells that express semi-invariant {beta} T cell receptors (TCR) and recognise -galactosylceramides. However, CD1d also presents structurally distinct lipids to NKT cells expressing diverse TCRs (type II NKT cells) but our knowledge of the antigens for type II NKT cells is limited. An early study identified an NKT cell agonist, phenyl pentamethyldihydrobenzofuransulfonate (PPBF), which is notable for its similarity to common sulfa-drugs, but its mechanism of NKT-cell activation remained unknown. Here we demonstrate that a range of pentamethylbenzofuransulfonate (PBFs), including PPBF, activate polyclonal type II NKT cells from human donors. Whereas these sulfa drug-like molecules might have acted pharmacologically on cells, here we demonstrate direct contact between TCRs and PBF-treated CD1d complexes. Further, PBF-treated CD1d-tetramers identified type II NKT cell populations cells expressing {beta} and {gamma}{delta}TCRs, including those with variable and joining region gene usage (TRAV12-1-TRAJ6) that was conserved across donors. By trapping a CD1d-type II NKT TCR complex for direct mass spectrometric analysis, we detected molecules that allow binding of CD1d to TCRs, finding that both PBF and short-chain sphingomyelin lipids are present in these complexes. Furthermore, the combination of PPBF and short-chain sphingomyelin enhances CD1d tetramer staining of PPBF-reactive T cell lines over either molecule alone. This study demonstrates that non-lipidic small molecules, that resemble sulfa-drugs implicated in systemic hypersensitivity and drug allergy reactions, activate a polyclonal population of type II NKT cells in a CD1d-restricted manner.\n\nSignificance StatementWhereas T cells are known to recognize peptide, vitamin B metabolite or lipid antigens, we identify several non-lipidic small molecules, pentamethylbenzofuransulfonates (PBFs), that activate a population of CD1d-restricted NKT cells. This represents a breakthrough in the field of NKT cell biology. This study also reveals a previously unknown population of PBF-reactive NKT cells in healthy individuals with stereotyped receptors that paves the way for future studies of the role of these cells in immunity, including sulfa-drug hypersensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Building a nervous system is a protracted process that starts with the specification of individual neuron types and ends with the formation of mature neural circuits. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the temporal progression of maturation in individual cell types remain poorly understood. In this work, we have mapped the gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes in mouse spinal motor neurons throughout their lifetimes. We found that both motor neuron gene expression and putative regulatory elements are dynamic during the first three weeks of postnatal life, when motor circuits are maturing. Genes that are up-regulated during this time contribute to adult motor neuron diversity and function. Almost all of the chromatin regions that gain accessibility during maturation are motor neuron specific, yet a majority of the transcription factor binding motifs enriched in these regions are shared with other mature neurons. Collectively, these findings suggest that a core transcriptional program operates in a context-dependent manner to access cell-type-specific cis-regulatory systems associated with maturation genes. Discovery of general principles governing neuronal maturation might inform methods for transcriptional reprogramming of neuronal age and for improved modelling of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The two predominant oak species in Britain are Quercus robur (English or pedunculate oak) and Q. petraea (sessile oak). We sequenced the whole genomes of 386 oak trees from four British parkland sites and found over 50 million nuclear single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), allowing us to identify 360 Q. robur, ten Q. petraea and 16 hybrid individuals using clustering methods. Comparing Q. robur and Q. petraea trees from Attingham Park, we found that the nuclear genomes of the two species are largely undifferentiated but identified 81 coding regions exhibiting strong interspecific differentiation. The nuclear genomes of our 360 Q. robur individuals showed no clear differentiation among the four parkland sites. Scans for selective sweeps in Q. robur highlighted regions containing genes with putative involvement in stress tolerance, one of which was moderately differentiated from Q. petraea. Reconstructions of past effective population sizes suggested a long population size decline in both Q. robur and Q. petraea over the Pleistocene, but population growth after the last glacial maximum. We assembled the whole chloroplast genomes of 287 Q. robur, 8 Q. petraea and 14 hybrid trees. In a phylogenetic network, these fell into five major haplotypes, which were shared among species but differed in frequency among parkland sites. We matched our chloroplast genome haplotypes to restriction enzyme fragment haplotypes identified in older studies that had surveyed ancient woodlands in Britain and much of Europe. This suggested that the parkland populations in our study derive from local seed sources.",

Trp53 ablation in the Rnu11 cKO mice did not prevent microcephaly. However, RNAseq analysis of the double knockout (dKO) pallium reflected transcriptomic shift towards the control from the Rnu11 cKO. We found elevated minor intron retention and alternative splicing across minor introns in the dKO. Disruption of these MIGs resulted in cell cycle defects that were more severe and detected earlier in the dKO, but with delayed detection of {gamma}H2aX+ DNA damage. Thus, p53 might also play a role in causing DNA damage in the developing pallium. In all, our findings further refine our understanding of the role of the minor spliceosome in cortical development and identify MIGs underpinning microcephaly in minor spliceosome-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of sequencing technologies in the past decade, next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis has been widely applied in cancer genomics research. More recently, NGS has been adopted in clinical oncology to advance personalized medicine. Clinical applications of precision oncology require accurate tests that can distinguish tumor-specific mutations from errors or artifacts introduced during NGS processes or data analysis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop best practices in cancer mutation detection using NGS and the need for standard reference data sets for systematically benchmarking sequencing platforms, library protocols, bioinformatics pipelines and for measuring accuracy and reproducibility across platforms and methods. Within the SEQC2 consortium context, we established paired tumor-normal reference samples, a human triple-negative breast cancer cell line and a matched normal cell line derived from B lymphocytes. We generated whole-genome (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) data using 16 NGS library preparation protocols, seven sequencing platforms at six different centers. We systematically interrogated somatic mutations in the paired reference samples to identify factors affecting detection reproducibility and accuracy in cancer genomes. These large cross-platform/site WGS and WES datasets using well-characterized reference samples will represent a powerful resource for benchmarking NGS technologies, bioinformatics pipelines, and for the cancer genomics studies.",

    "abstract": "Outbreaks of carbapenemase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPKp) represent a major threat for hospitals. We molecularly characterized the first outbreak of VIM-1 producing K. pneumoniae in Spain, that raised fears about the spread of this strain or of the plasmid carrying blaVIM-1. Through in-depth genomic analysis of 18 isolates recovered between October 2005 and September 2007, we show that 17 ST39 isolates were clonal, whereas the last isolate had acquired the VIM-1 plasmid from the epidemic clone. The index isolate carried 31 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and was resistant to almost all antibiotics tested. Later isolates further gained mutations in efflux pumps regulators ramR and opxR, deletion of mgrB (colistin resistance) and frameshift mutations in ompK36 ({beta}-lactam resistance) likely selected by antibiotic usage. Comparison with publicly available genome sequences and literature review revealed no sign of dissemination of this CPKp strain. However, the VIM-1 plasmid was found in diverse Enterobacterales species, although restricted to Spain. One isolate became urease negative following IS5075 transposition into ureC. Analysis of 9755 K. pneumoniae genomes showed the same ureC::IS5075 insertion in 14.1% of the isolates and explained why urease activity is a variable identification trait for K pneumoniae. Transposition into ureC results from the similarity of its 3-end and the terminal inverted repeats of Tn21 like transposons, the targets of IS5075 and related ISs. As these transposons frequently carry ARGs, this might explain the frequent chromosomal invasion by these ISs and ureC inactivation in multidrug resistant isolates.\n\nIMPORTANCEEvolution of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens occurs at multiple scales, in the patient, locally in the hospital or more globally. Some mutations or gene acquisitions, for instance in response to antibiotic treatment, may be restricted to a single patient due to their high fitness cost. However, some events are more general. By analyzing the evolution of a hospital acquired multidrug resistant K. pneumoniae strain producing the carbapenemase VIM-1, we showed a likely environmental source in the hospital and identified mutations contributing to a further decrease in antibiotic susceptibility. By combining the genomic analysis of this outbreak with literature data and genome sequences available in databases, we showed that the VIM-1 plasmid has been acquired by different Enterobacterales but is only endemic in Spain. We also discovered that urease loss in K. pneumoniae results from the specific transposition of an IS element into the ureC gene and was more frequent in fluoroquinolone resistant isolates and carrying a carbapenemase gene.",

The integration of the differentially expressed ncRNAs, with an exhaustive computational analysis of their experimentally supported targets, led us to dissect complex networks integrated by the cancer-related lncRNAs Malat, Neat1, H19, Meg3 and their associated miRNA-target pairs. These networks would modulate pathways related to KSHV pathogenesis, such as viral carcinogenesis, p53 signaling, RNA surveillance, and Cell cycle control.

    "abstract": "The oral cavity is an entrance for respiratory viruses, such as influenza. Recently, saliva has been shown to exert both antimicrobial and antiviral activities. Thus, saliva may be a biological factor that contributes to the prevention of influenza infection. However, the actual salivary anti-influenza A virus (IAV) activity in individuals and its determinant factors are unknown. By assessing individual variations in salivary anti-IAV activity in 92 people using an established new high-throughput system in this study, we found that the anti-IAV activity varied widely between individuals and showed a significant positive correlation with protein-bound sialic acid (BSA) level ({rho}=0.473; p < 0.001). Furthermore, the anti-IAV activity of saliva with enzymatically reduced BSA content was significantly lower. These results indicate that BSA is a direct regulator of salivary anti-IAV activity and is a determinant of individual differences. Additionally, after comparing the anti-IAV activity across the groups by age, anti-IAV activity in young people (aged 5-19 years) were lower than in adults aged 20-59 years and elderly people aged 60-79 years. Our study suggests that BSA levels in saliva may be important in preventing influenza infection.",

    "abstract": "The soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis is known to suppress pathogens as well as promote plant growth. However, in order to fully exploit the potential as natural fertilizer, we need a better understanding of the interactions between B. subtilis and plants. Here, B. subtilis was examined for root colonization through experimental evolution on Arabidopsis thaliana. The populations evolved rapidly, improved in root colonization and diversified into three distinct morphotypes. In order to better understand the adaptation that had taken place, single evolved isolates from the final transfer were randomly selected for further characterization, revealing changes in growth and pellicle formation in medium supplemented with plant polysaccharides. Intriguingly, certain evolved isolates showed improved root colonization only on the plant species they evolved on, but not on another plant species, namely tomato, suggesting A. thaliana specific adaption paths. Finally, the mix performed better than the sum of its constituents in monoculture, which was demonstrated to be caused by complementarity effects. Our results suggest, that genetic diversification occurs in an ecological relevant setting on plant roots and proves to be a stable strategy for root colonization.\n\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding how plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) colonize plant roots is crucial to fully utilize their potential for agricultural applications. Here, we employ experimental evolution of the PGPR Bacillus subtilis on Arabidopsis thaliana to study root colonization. We revealed that evolving populations rapidly improve in root colonization and diversify into distinct morphotypes. Notably, improved root colonization by evolved isolates was observed on A. thaliana, not on tomato. Moreover, isolates of distinct morphotypes interacted during root colonization and the mixture of morphotypes showed higher productivity than predicted. These findings suggest that genetic diversification might be a stable strategy to maximize root colonization.",

    "abstract": "Increase in the size of human neocortex, acquired in evolution, accounts for the unique cognitive capacity of humans. This expansion appears to reflect the evolutionarily-enhanced proliferative ability of basal progenitors (BPs) in mammalian cortex, which may have been acquired through epigenetic alterations in BPs. However, whether or how the epigenome in BPs differs across species is not known. Here, we report that histone H3 acetylation is a key epigenetic regulation in BP amplification and cortical expansion. Through epigenetic profiling of sorted BPs, we show that H3K9 acetylation is low in murine BPs and high in human BPs. Elevated H3K9ac preferentially increases BP proliferation, increasing the size and folding of the normally smooth mouse neocortex. Mechanistically, H3K9ac drives BP amplification by increasing expression of the evolutionarily regulated gene, TRNP1, in the developing cortex. Our findings demonstrate a previously unknown mechanism that controls cortical architecture.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryH3K9ac promotes basal progenitor amplification, neocortex expansion and gyrification by activating TRNP1 expression in evolution.",
