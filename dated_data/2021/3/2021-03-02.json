    "abstract": "Saline wetlands are keystone ecosystems in arid and semi-arid landscapes that are currently under severe threat. This study conducted spatio-temporal modelling of the largest saline Ramsar site of India, in Sambhar wetland from 1963-2059. One CORONA aerial photograph of 1963 and Landsat images of 1972, 1981, 1992, 2009, and 2019 were acquired and classified under 8 classes as Aravalli, barren land, saline soil, salt crust, saltpans, waterbody, settlement, and vegetation for spatial modelling integrated with bird census, soil-water parameters, GPS locations, and photographs. Past decadal area statistics state reduction of waterbody from 30.7 to 3.4% at constant rate (4.23%) to saline soil. Saline soil increased from 12.4 to 21.7% and saline soil converted to barren land from 45.4 to 49.6%; saltpans from 7.4 to 14% and settlement from increased 0.1 to 1.3% till 2019. Future predictions hint at a net increase of 20% by wetland, vegetation by 30%, settlement by 40%, saltpan by 10%, barren land by 5%, and net loss of 20%, each by Aravalli and salt crust. The biggest loss of 120% was seen by saline soil converted to barren land. Notably, 40% of the current wetland will be lost by 2059. Additionally, soil-water parameters result state a loss of saline character of wetland ecosystem; subsequently bird statistics indicate a shift in migratory birds disturbing the wetland food web. India has been losing a critical habitat of migratory birds, halophytes, and halophiles, along with livelihood. This study looks to bridge the missing link from local to global wetland ecological disconnect, providing thereby lake management and restoration strategies.",

    "abstract": "Many animal species exhibit sex differences in the time period prior to reaching sexual maturity. However, the underlying mechanism for such biased maturation remains poorly understood. Females of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster eclose 4 h faster on average than males, owing to differences in the pupal period between the sexes; this characteristic is referred to as the protogyny phenotype. Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism underlying the protogyny phenotype in the fruit fly using our newly developed Drosophila Individual Activity Monitoring and Detecting System (DIAMonDS), which can continuously detect the precise timing of both pupariation and eclosion of individual flies. Via this system, following the laying of eggs, we detected the precise time points of pupariation and eclosion of a large number of individual flies simultaneously and succeeded in identifying the tiny differences in pupal duration between females and males. We first explored the role of physiological sex by establishing transgender flies via knockdown of the sex-determination gene, transformer (tra) and its co-factor tra2, which retained the protogyny phenotype. In addition, disruption of dosage compensation by male-specific lethal (msl-2) knockdown did not affect the protogyny phenotype. The Drosophila master sex switch gene--Sxl promotes female differentiation via tra and turns off male dosage compensation through the repression of msl-2. However, we observed that stage-specific whole-body knockdown and mutation of Sxl induced disturbance of the protogyny phenotype. These results suggest that an additional, non-canonical function of Sxl involves establishing the protogyny phenotype in D. melanogaster.\n\nAuthor summaryA wide variety of animals show differences in time points of sexual maturation between sexes. For example, in many mammals, including human beings, females mature faster than males. This maturation often takes several months or years, and precisely detecting the time point of maturation is challenging, because of the continuity of growth, especially in mammals. Moreover, the reason behind the difference in sexual maturation time points between sexes is not fully understood. The fruit fly Drosophila--a model organism--also shows biased maturation between the sexes, with females emerging 4 h faster than males (a characteristic known as the protogyny phenotype). To understand the mechanism underlying the protogyny phenotype, we used our newly developed system, Drosophila Individual Activity Monitoring and Detecting System (DIAMonDS), to detect the precise eclosion point in individual fruit flies. Surprisingly, our analysis of transgender flies obtained by knockdown and overexpression techniques indicated that a physiological gender might not be necessary requirement for protogyny and that a non-canonical novel function of the fruit fly master sex switch gene, Sxl, regulates protogyny in fruit flies.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow has been demonstrated along nasal lymphatics via olfactory nerve projections; flow may be increased by stimulating lymphatic contractility using agents such as noradrenaline and the thromboxane A2 analog U46619. Lymphatics elsewhere in the body show increased contractility upon exposure to the prostaglandin F2alpha analog isoprostane-8-epi-prostaglandin. We investigated the ability of ophthalmic prostaglandin F2alpha analogs to increase CSF outflow when applied to the nasal mucosa by inhalation.\n\nMethodsLatanoprost (0.1, 0.5, or 1mg/ml), bimatoprost (0.3 or 3mg/ml), travoprost (0.04 or 0.4mg/ml), latanoprostene bunod (0.24 or 2.4mg/ml), tafluprost (0.25 or 2.5mg/ml), or vehicle (10% DMSO) was administered to awake adult C57B/6 mice by nasal inhalation of 2l droplets. A total of 67 animals were studied including controls. General anesthesia was induced by injection, and fluorescent tracer (AlexaFluor647-labelled ovalbumin) was injected under stereotaxic guidance into the right lateral ventricle. Nasal turbinate tissue was harvested and homogenized after 1 hour for tracer detection by ELISA and fluorometric analysis.\n\nResultsInhalation of latanoprost 0.5mg/ml and 1mg/ml led to a 11.5-fold increase in tracer recovery from nasal turbinate tissues compared to controls (3312 pg/ml vs 288 pg/ml, p<0.001 for 0.5mg/ml; 3355 pg/ml vs 288 pg/ml, p<0.001 for 1mg/ml), while latanoprost 0.1 mg/ml enhanced recovery 6-fold (1713 pg/ml vs 288 pg/ml, p<0.01). Tafluprost 0.25mg/ml and bimatoprost 0.3mg/ml showed a modest (1.4x, p<0.05) effect, and the remaining agents showed no significant effect on tracer recovery.\n\nConclusionsProstaglandin F2alpha analogs delivered by nasal inhalation resulted in increased nasal recovery of a CSF fluorescent tracer, implying increased CSF outflow via the nasal lymphatics. The greatest effect, partially dose-dependent, was observed using latanoprost. Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy of these agents in reducing ICP in short and long-term applications.",

    "abstract": "The glycosphingolipid (GSL) globoside (Gb4) is essential for parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection. Historically considered the cellular receptor of B19V, the role of Gb4 and its interaction with B19V are controversial. In this study, we applied artificial viral particles, genetically modified cells, and specific competitors to address the interplay between the virus and the GSL. Our findings demonstrate that Gb4 is not involved in the binding or internalization process of the virus into permissive erythroid cells, a function that corresponds to the VP1u cognate receptor. However, Gb4 is essential at a post-internalization step before the delivery of the single-stranded viral DNA into the nucleus. In susceptible erythroid Gb4 knockout cells, incoming viruses were arrested in the endosomal compartment, showing no cytoplasmic spreading of capsids as observed in Gb4-expressing cells. Hemagglutination and binding assays revealed that pH acts as a switch to modulate the affinity between the virus and the GSL. Capsids interact with Gb4 exclusively under acidic conditions and dissociate at neutral pH. Inducing a specific Gb4-mediated attachment to permissive erythroid cells by acidification of the extracellular environment led to a non-infectious uptake of the virus, indicating that low pH-mediated binding to the GSL initiates active membrane processes resulting in vesicle formation. In summary, this study provides mechanistic insight into the interaction of B19V with Gb4. The strict pH-dependent binding to the ubiquitously expressed GSL prevents the redirection of the virus to nonpermissive tissues while promoting the interaction in acidic intracellular compartments as an essential step in infectious endocytic trafficking.\n\nAuthor summaryThe neutral glycosphingolipid globoside (Gb4) has been historically considered the cellular receptor of B19V, however, its wide expression profile does not correlate well with the restricted tropism of the virus. Here, we show that Gb4 is essential for the infection at a step following virus uptake and before the delivery of the viral ssDNA into the nucleus. B19V interacts with Gb4 exclusively under acidic conditions, prohibiting the interaction on the plasma membrane and promoting it inside the acidic endosomal compartments, which are engaged by the virus and the GSL after internalization. In the absence of Gb4, incoming viruses are retained in the endocytic compartment and the infection is aborted. This study reveals the mechanism of the interaction between the virus and the glycosphingolipid and redefines the role of Gb4 as an essential intracellular partner required for infectious entry.",

    "abstract": "Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) require replication across a wide range of temperatures to perpetuate. While vertebrate hosts tend to maintain temperatures of approximately 37{degrees}C - 40{degrees}C, arthropods are subject to ambient temperatures which can have a daily fluctuation of > 10{degrees}C. Temperatures impact vector competence, extrinsic incubation period, and mosquito survival unimodally, with optimum occurring at some intermediate temperature. In addition, the mean and range of daily temperature fluctuations influence arbovirus perpetuation and vector competence. The impact of temperature on arbovirus genetic diversity during systemic mosquito infection, however, is poorly understood. Therefore, we determined how constant extrinsic incubation temperatures of 25{degrees}C, 28{degrees}C, 32{degrees}C, and 35{degrees}C control Zika virus (ZIKV) vector competence and population dynamics within Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. We also examined diurnally fluctuating temperatures which more faithfully mimic field conditions in the tropics. We found that vector competence varied in a unimodal manner for constant temperatures peaking between 28{degrees}C and 32{degrees}C for both Aedes species. Transmission peaked at 10 days post-infection for Aedes aegypti and 14 days for Aedes albopictus. The effect of diurnal temperature was distinct and could not have been predicted from constant temperature-derived data. Using RNA-seq to characterize ZIKV population structure, we identified that temperature alters the selective environment in unexpected ways. During mosquito infection, constant temperatures more often elicited positive selection whereas diurnal temperatures led to strong purifying selection in both Aedes species. These findings demonstrate that temperature has multiple impacts on ZIKV biology within mosquitoes, including major effects on the selective environment within mosquitoes.\n\nAuthor SummaryArthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) have emerged in recent decades due to complex factors that include increases in international travel and trade, the breakdown of public health infrastructure, land use changes, and many other factors. Climate change also has the potential to shift the geographical ranges of arthropod vectors, consequently increasing the global risk of arbovirus infection. Changing temperatures may also alter the virus-host interaction, ultimately resulting in the emergence of new viruses and virus genotypes in new areas. Therefore, we sought to characterize how temperature (both constant and fluctuating) alters the ability of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus to transmit Zika virus, and how it influences virus populations within mosquitoes. We found that intermediate temperatures maximize virus transmission compared to more extreme and fluctuating temperatures. Constant temperatures increased positive selection on virus genomes, while fluctuating temperatures strengthened purifying selection. Our studies provide evidence that in addition to altering VC, temperature significantly influences the selective environment within mosquitoes.",

Furthermore, biochemical and functional studies on mutant strains lacking either LhcbM1 or LhcbM5 indicate that only LhcbM5 is indispensable in the supercomplex formation.

    "abstract": "Loss of functional pancreatic {beta}-cell mass and increased {beta}-cell apoptosis are fundamental to the pathophysiology of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Pancreatic islet transplantation has the potential to cure type 1 diabetes but is often ineffective due to the death of the islet graft within the first few years after transplant. Therapeutic strategies to directly target pancreatic {beta}-cell survival are needed to prevent and treat diabetes and to improve islet transplant outcomes. Reducing {beta}-cell apoptosis is also a therapeutic strategy for type 2 diabetes. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide hormone typically produced in the gut after food intake, with positive effects on obesity and glucose metabolism in mouse models and human subjects. We have previously shown that pancreatic islets also produce CCK. The production of CCK within the islet promotes {beta}-cell survival in rodent models of diabetes and aging. Now, we demonstrate a direct effect of CCK to reduce cytokine-mediated apoptosis in a {beta}-cell line and in isolated mouse islets in a receptor-dependent manner. However, whether CCK can protect human {beta}-cells was previously unknown. Here, we report that CCK can also reduce cytokine-mediated apoptosis in isolated human islets and CCK treatment in vivo decreases {beta}-cell apoptosis in human islets transplanted into the kidney capsule of diabetic NOD/SCID mice. Collectively, these data identify CCK as a novel therapy that can directly promote {beta}-cell survival in human islets and has therapeutic potential to preserve {beta}-cell mass in diabetes and as an adjunct therapy after transplant.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryCholecystokinin ameliorates pancreatic {beta}-cell death under models of stress and after transplant of human islets.",

    "abstract": "The therian-specific gene paternally expressed 10 (Peg10) plays an essential role in placenta formation: Peg10 knockout (KO) mice exhibit early embryonic lethality due to severe placental defects. The PEG10 protein exhibits homology to long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon GAG and POL proteins, therefore mice harboring a mutation in its highly conserved viral aspartic protease motif in the POL-like region were generated because it is essential for LTR retrotransposons/retroviruses. Intriguingly, frequent perinatal lethality, not early embryonic lethality, was observed with fetal and placental growth retardation starting mid-gestation. In the mutant placentas, severe defects were observed in the fetal vasculature, where PEG10 is expressed in the three trophoblast cell layers that surround fetal capillary endothelial cells. Thus, Peg10 has essential roles not only in early placenta formation, but also in placental vasculature maintenance from mid- to late-gestation. This implies that along the feto-maternal placenta interface an interaction occurs between two retrovirus-derived genes, Peg10 and retrotransposon Gag like 1 (Rtl1, also called Peg11), that is essential for the maintenance of fetal capillary endothelial cells.\n\nSummary statementDisruption of the highly conserved viral aspartic protease domain in PEG10 causes placental abnormality leading to perinatal lethality in mice.",

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid aptamers are generated by an in vitro molecular evolution method known as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). A variety of candidates is limited by actual sequencing data from an experiment. Here, we developed RaptGen, which is a variational autoencoder for in silico aptamer generation. RaptGen exploits a profile hidden Markov model decoder to represent motif sequences effectively. We showed that RaptGen embedded simulation sequence data into low-dimension latent space dependent on motif information. We also performed sequence embedding using two independent SELEX datasets. RaptGen successfully generated aptamers from the latent space even though they were not included in high-throughput sequencing. RaptGen could also generate a truncated aptamer with a short learning model. We demonstrated that RaptGen could be applied to activity-guided aptamer generation according to Bayesian optimization. We concluded that a generative method by RaptGen and latent representation are useful for aptamer discovery. Codes are available at https://github.com/hmdlab/raptgen.",

    "abstract": "The flower of angiosperms is the most complex organ that plants generate and many transcription factors (TFs) are involved to regulate its morphogenesis in a coordinated way. In its center, the gynoecium develops consisting of specialized tissues such as secondary meristems, sites of postgenital fusion, ovules, pollen transmitting tract, all to assure successful sexual reproduction. Gynoecium development requires tight regulation of developmental regulators across time and tissues. However, while we know of several examples how simple on/off regulation of gene expression is achieved in plants, it remains unclear which regulatory processes generate complex expression patterns. Here, we use the gynoecium developmental regulator CRABS CLAW (CRC) from Arabidopsis to study regulatory mechanisms contributing to its sophisticated expression pattern. Using a combination of in silico promoter analyses, global TF-DNA interaction screens, co-expression and mutant analysis we find that miRNA action, DNA methylation, and chromatin remodeling do not contribute substantially to CRC regulation. We show that a plethora of TFs bind to the CRC promoter to fine-tune transcript abundance by activation of transcription, linking CRC to specific developmental processes but not biotic or abiotic stress. Interestingly, the temporal-spatial aspects of regulation of expression may be under the control of redundantly acting genes and may require higher order complex formation at TF binding sites. We conclude that endogenous regulation of complex expression pattern of Arabidopsis genes requires orchestrated transcription factor action on several conserved promotor sites over almost 4 kb in length.\n\nSignificance statementDifferent to genes that are simply switched on or off, depending on an environmental cue we find that genes directing development in plants often show complex expression pattern dependent on internal factors only. Here, we addressed the question how an complex expression pattern is achieved and use the CRABS CLAW (CRC) gene required for gynoecium development as an example. Combining wet lab experiments and in silico analysis we find that epigenetic regulation plays only a minor role and that a large number of transcription factors activates the transcription of CRC. Single regulators may have a profound effect on CRC transcript abundance but less so on the pattern of expression. Complex patterns most likely require the interplay of several transcription factors.",

    "abstract": "Model systems that recapitulate the complexity of human tumors and the reality of variable treatment responses are urgently needed to better understand cancer biology and to develop more effective cancer therapies. Here we report development and characterization of a large bank of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and matched organoid cultures from tumors that represent some of the greatest unmet needs in breast cancer research and treatment. These include endocrine-resistant, treatment-refractory, and metastatic breast cancers and, in some cases, multiple tumor collections from the same patients. The models can be grown long-term with high fidelity to the original tumors. We show that development of matched PDX and PDX-derived organoid (PDxO) models facilitates high-throughput drug screening that is feasible and cost-effective, while also allowing in vivo validation of results. Our data reveal consistency between drug screening results in organoids and drug responses in breast cancer PDX. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of using these patient-derived models for precision oncology in real time with patient care, using a case of a triple negative breast cancer with early metastatic recurrence as an example. Our results uncovered an FDA-approved drug with high efficacy against the models. Treatment with the PDxO-directed therapy resulted in a complete response for the patient and a progression-free survival period more than three times longer than her previous therapies. This work provides valuable new methods and resources for functional precision medicine and drug development for human breast cancer.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=189 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/433268v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@134d5cdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c0a419org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@556a4forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b68c9c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The metacognitive sense of confidence can play a critical role in regulating decisionmaking. In particular, a lack of confidence can justify the explicit, potentially costly, instrumental acquisition of extra information that might resolve the underlying uncertainty. Recent work has suggested a statistically sophisticated tapestry behind the information governing both the making and monitoring of choices. Here, we extend this tapestry to reveal extra richness in the use of confidence for controlling information seeking. We thereby highlight how different models of metacognition can generate diverse relationships between action, confidence, and information search. More broadly, our work shows how crucial it can be to treat metacognitive monitoring and control together.",

We assessed the impact of genomic differences following glucocorticoid administration by examining the transcriptional profile of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived glutamatergic neurons and live cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells from combat veterans with PTSD (n=5) and without PTSD (n=5). This parallel examination in baseline and glucocorticoid-treated conditions resolves cell-type specific and diagnosis-dependent elements of stress response, and permits discrimination of gene expression signals associated with PTSD risk from those induced by stress. Computational analyses revealed neuron-specific glucocorticoid-response expression patterns that were enriched for transcriptomic patterns observed in clinical PTSD samples. PTSD-specific signatures, albeit underpowered, accurately stratify veterans with PTSD relative to combat-exposed controls. Overall, in vitro PTSD and glucocorticoid response signatures in blood and brain cells represent exciting new platforms with which to test the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying PTSD, identify biomarkers of PTSD risk and onset, and conduct drug-screening to identify novel therapeutics to prevent or ameliorate clinical phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIndividuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) are vulnerable to deficits in working memory, and the search for neural correlates of working memory in circumscribed areas has yielded inconclusive findings. Given the widespread neural alterations observed in MS, predictive modeling approaches that capitalize on whole-brain connectivity may better capture individual-level working memory in this population.\n\nMethodsHere, we applied connectome-based predictive modeling to functional MRI data from working memory tasks in two independent samples with relapsing-remitting MS. In the internal validation sample (ninternal = 36), functional connectivity data were used to train a model through cross-validation to predict accuracy on the Paced Visual Serial Addition Test, a gold-standard measure of working memory in MS. We then tested its ability to predict performance on the N-back working memory task in the external validation sample (nexternal = 36).\n\nResultsThe resulting model successfully predicted working memory in the internal validation sample but did not extend to the external sample. We also tested the generalizability of an existing model of working memory derived in healthy young adults to people with MS. It showed successful prediction in both MS samples, demonstrating its translational potential. We qualitatively explored differences between the healthy and MS models in intra- and inter-network connectivity amongst canonical networks.\n\nDiscussionThese findings suggest that connectome-based predictive models derived in people with MS may have limited generalizability. Instead, models identified in healthy individuals may offer superior generalizability to clinical samples, such as MS, and may serve as more useful targets for intervention.\n\nImpact StatementWorking memory deficits in people with multiple sclerosis have important consequence for employment, leisure, and daily living activities. Identifying a functional connectivity-based marker that accurately captures individual differences in working memory may offer a useful target for cognitive rehabilitation. Manglani et al. demonstrate machine learning can be applied to whole-brain functional connectivity data to identify networks that predict individual-level working memory in people with multiple sclerosis. However, existing network-based models of working memory derived in healthy adults outperform those identified in multiple sclerosis, suggesting translational potential of brain networks derived in large, healthy samples for predicting cognition in multiple sclerosis.",

Modelling HD has remained challenging, as rodent and cellular models poorly recapitulate the disease. To address this, we generated induced neurons (iNs) through direct reprogramming of human skin fibroblasts, which retain age-dependent epigenetic characteristics. HD-iNs displayed profound deficits in autophagy, characterised by reduced transport of late autophagic structures from the neurites to the soma. The neurite-specific alterations in autophagy resulted in shorter, thinner and fewer neurites presented by HD-iNs. CRISPRi-mediated silencing of HTT did not rescue this phenotype but rather resulted in additional autophagy alterations in ctrl-iNs, highlighting the importance of wild type HTT in neuronal autophagy. In summary, our work identifies a distinct subcellular autophagy impairment in aged patient derived HD-neurons and provides a new rational for future development of autophagy activation therapies.",

In olfaction, it is unknown to what degree sensory perception, in particular the perception of odor pleasantness, is dictated by universal biological principles versus sculpted by culture. To address this issue, we asked 235 individuals from 9 diverse non-western cultures to rank the hedonic value of monomolecular odorants. We observed substantial global consistency, with molecular identity explaining 41% of the variance in individual pleasantness rankings, while culture explained only 6%. These rankings were predicted by the physicochemical properties of out-of-sample molecules and out-of-sample pleasantness ratings given by a separate group of industrialized western urbanites, indicating human olfactory perception is strongly constrained by universal principles.",

    "abstract": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is postulated to exert  top-down control by modulating information processing throughout the brain to promote specific actions based on current goals. However, the pathways mediating top-down control remain poorly understood. In particular, knowledge about direct prefrontal connections that might facilitate top-down prefrontal control of information processing in the hippocampus remains sparse. Here we describe novel monosynaptic long-range GABAergic projections from PFC to hippocampus. These preferentially inhibit vasoactive intestinal polypeptide expressing interneurons, which are known to disinhibit hippocampal microcircuits. Indeed, stimulating prefrontal-hippocampal GABAergic projections increases hippocampal feedforward inhibition and reduces hippocampal activity in vivo. The net effect of these actions is to specifically enhance the signal-to-noise ratio for hippocampal representations of objects. Correspondingly, stimulation of PFC-to-hippocampus GABAergic projections promotes object exploration. Together, these results elucidate a novel top-down pathway in which long-range GABAergic projections target disinhibitory microcircuits, thereby enhancing signals and network dynamics underlying exploratory behavior.",

This paper reports that gallic acid, a catechol compound selected from derivatives of methyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (MDHB), selectively induces NSCs to differentiate into immature neurons and promotes proliferation by activating phosphorylation of key proteins in the MAPK-ERK pathway. In addition, we found that 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid was the main active structure which could show neurotrophic activity. The substitution of carboxyl group on the benzene ring into ester group may promote differentiation on the basis of the structure of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Meanwhile, the introduction of 5-hydroxyl group may promote proliferation. Generally, this study identified a natural catechol compound that promotes differentiation and proliferation of NSCs in vitro.",

Here, we leverage yeast and Drosophila model systems to uncover a novel role for the Hobbit/Hob proteins at ER-PM contact sites. We find that Hobbit localizes to ER-PM contact sites in both yeast cells and the Drosophila larval salivary glands, and this localization is mediated by an N-terminal ER membrane anchor and conserved C-terminal sequences. The C-terminus of Hobbit binds to plasma membrane phosphatidylinositols, and the distribution of these lipids is altered in hobbit mutant cells. Notably, the Hobbit protein is essential for viability in higher animals, providing one of the first examples of a membrane contact site-localized lipid binding protein that is required for development.",

    "abstract": "Compartmentalization is one of the principles of chromosome 3D organization and has been suggested to be driven by the attraction of heterochromatin. The extent to which the pericentromeric heterochromatin (PCH) impacts chromosome compartmentalization is yet unclear. Here we produced a chromosome-level and fully phased diploid genome of an aquaculture fish, zig-zag eel (Mastacembelus armatus), and identified the centromeric and pericentromeric regions in the majority of chromosomes of both haploid genomes. The PCH is on average 4.2 Mb long, covering 17.7% of the chromosomes, and is the major target of histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3). In nearly half of the chromosomes, the PCH drives the chromosomes into two or three megascale chromatin domains with the PCH being a single one. We further demonstrate that PCH has a major impact in submetacentric, metacentric and small telocentric chromosomes in which the PCH drives the distribution of active and inactive compartments along the chromosomes. Additionally, we identified the young and homomorphic XY sex chromosomes that are submetacentric with the entire short-arm heterochromatinized. Interestingly, the sex-determining region seems to arise within the PCH that has been in place prior to the X-Y divergence and recombination suppression. Together, we demonstrate that the PCH can cover a considerably large portion of the chromosomes, and when it does so, it drives chromosome compartmentalization; and we propose a new model for the origin and evolution of homomorphic sex chromosomes in fish.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical ontologies are established tools that organize knowledge in specialized research areas. They can also be used to train machine-learning models. However, it is unclear to what extent representations of ontology concepts learned by machine-learning models capture the relationships intended by ontology curators. It is also unclear whether the representations can provide insights to improve the curation process. Here, we investigate ontologies from across the spectrum of biological research and assess the concordance of formal ontology hierarchies with representations based on plain-text definitions. By comparing the internal properties of each ontology, we describe general patterns across the pan-ontology landscape and pinpoint areas with discrepancies in individual domains. We suggest specific mechanisms through which machine-learning approaches can lead to clarifications of ontology definitions. Synchronizing patterns in machine-derived representations with those intended by the ontology curators will likely streamline the use of ontologies in downstream applications.",

    "abstract": "Activity in each brain region is shaped by the convergence of ascending and descending axonal pathways, and the balance and characteristics of these determine neural output. The medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system is part of a reflex arc that critically controls auditory sensitivity. Multiple central pathways contact MOC neurons, raising the question of how a reflex arc could be engaged by diverse inputs. We examined functional properties of synapses onto brainstem MOC neurons from ascending (ventral cochlear nucleus, VCN), and descending (inferior colliculus, IC) sources in mice using an optogenetic approach. We found that these pathways exhibited opposing forms of short-term plasticity, with VCN input showing depression and IC input showing marked facilitation. By using a conductance clamp approach, we found that combinations of facilitating and depressing inputs enabled firing of MOC neurons over a surprisingly wide dynamic range, suggesting an essential role for descending signaling to a brainstem nucleus.",

Using Nr4a3-Tocky mice as a digital read-out of NFAT pathway activity, we identify the rapid quantitative and qualitative changes that occur in CD4+ T cells in response to a range of TCR signalling strengths. We demonstrate that the time and dose dependent programming of distinct co-inhibitory receptors rapidly re-calibrates T cell activation thresholds. By developing a new in vivo model, we analyse the immediate effects of ICB on T cell re-activation. Our findings reveal that anti-PD1 but not anti-Lag3 immunotherapy leads to an increased TCR signal strength. We define a strong TCR signal metric of five genes specifically upregulated by anti-PD1 in T cells (TCR.strong), which can stratify clinical outcomes during anti-PD1 monotherapy in melanoma patients. Our study therefore reveals how analysis of TCR signal strength - and its manipulation - can provide powerful metrics for monitoring outcomes to immunotherapy.\n\nKey PointsO_LITCR signal strength-dependent programming of CD4+ T cells revealed over time in vivo\nC_LIO_LIInhibitory receptor expression is dynamic, TCR signal strength dependent, and rapidly re-calibrates T cell activation thresholds\nC_LIO_LIPD1 but not Lag3 blockade leads to a unique and increased TCR signal strength signature (coined TCR.strong)\nC_LIO_LITCR.strong metric stratifies melanoma patient survival in response to Nivolumab (anti-PD1) therapy\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cancers that are histologically defined as the same type of cancer often need a distinct therapy based on underlying heterogeneity; likewise, histologically disparate cancers can require similar treatment approaches due to intrinsic similarities. A comprehensive analysis integrated with drug response data and genomic alterations, particularly to reveal therapeutic concordance mechanisms across histologically disparate tumour subtypes, has not yet been fully exploited.\n\nIn this study, we used pharmacogenomic profiling data provided from the Cancer Genome Project (CGP) in a systematic in silico investigation of the pharmacological subtypes of cancers and the intrinsic concordance of molecular mechanisms leading to similar therapeutic responses across histologically disparate tumour subtypes. We further developed a novel approach to redefine cell-to-cell similarity and drug-to-drug similarity from the therapeutic concordance, providing a new point of view to study cancer heterogeneity.\n\nOur study identified that histologically different tumours, such as malignant melanoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma, could belong to the same pharmacological subtype regarding drug sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, which was determined by their genomic alterations, high occurrence of BRAF or KRAS mutations. Therapeutic concordance for chemotherapy drugs was identified across histologically disparate hematological tumors mainly due to the extraordinary activation of the cell cycle in blood cancers. A subcluster of SCLC had a more similar profile with hematological tumors, and was associated with the malignant phenotype, with a higher level of MYC expression. We developed a website to store and visualize the pharmacological subtypes of drugs, as well as their connected genomic and expression alterations.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWe present Panakeia, a tool which strives to be easy to use and providing a detailed view of the pangenome structure which can efficiently be utilised for discovery, or further in-depth analysis, of features of interest. It analyses synteny and multiple structural patterns of the pangenome, giving insights into the biological diversity and evolution of the studied taxon. Panakeia hence provides both broad and detailed information on the structure of a pangenome, for diverse and highly clonal populations of bacteria. Development of new pan-genome analysis tools is important, as the pangenome of a microbial species has become an important method to define the diversity of a selected taxon, most commonly a species, in the last years. This enables comparison of strains from different ecological niches and can be used to define the functional potential in a bacterial population. It gives us a much better view of microbial genomics than can be gained from singular genomes which after all are just single representatives of a much more varied population.\n\nPreviously published pangenome tools often reduce the information to a presence/absence matrix of unconnected genes or generate massive hard to interpret output graphs. However, Panakeia includes synteny and structural information and presents it in a way that can readily be used for further analysis.

    "abstract": "Many physiological, biomechanical, evolutionary and clinical studies that explore skeletal structure and function require successful separation of trabecular from cortical compartments of a bone that has been imaged by X-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT) prior to analysis. Separation is often time-consuming, involves user bias and needs manual sub-division of these two similarly radio-opaque compartments. We have developed an objective, automated protocol which reduces user bias and enables straightforward, user-friendly segmentation of trabecular from cortical bone without requiring sophisticated programming expertise. This method can conveniently be used as a \"recipe\" in commercial programmes (Avizo herein) and applied to a variety of datasets. Here, we characterise and share this recipe, and demonstrate its application to a range of murine and human bone types, including normal and osteoarthritic specimens, and bones with distinct embryonic origins and spanning a range of ages. We validate the method by testing inter-user bias during the scan preparation steps and confirm utility in the architecturally challenging analysis of growing murine epiphyses. We also report details of the recipe, so that other groups can readily re-create a similar method in open access programs. Our aim is that this method will be adopted widely to create a more standardized and time efficient method of segmenting trabecular and cortical bone.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveComprehensive denoising is imperative in fMRI analysis to reliably evaluate neural activity from the blood oxygenation level dependent signal. In real-time fMRI, however, only a minimal denoising process has been applied and the impact of insufficient denoising on online brain activity estimation has not been assessed comprehensively. This study evaluated the noise reduction performance of online fMRI processes in a real-time estimation of regional brain activity and functional connectivity.\n\nApproachWe performed a series of real-time processing simulations of online fMRI processing, including slice-timing correction, motion correction, spatial smoothing, signal scaling, and noise regression with high-pass filtering, motion parameters, motion derivatives, global signal, white matter/ventricle average signals, and physiological noise models with image-based retrospective correction of physiological motion effects (RETROICOR) and respiration volume per time (RVT).\n\nMain resultsAll the processing was completed in less than 400 ms for whole-brain voxels. Most processing had a benefit for noise reduction except for RVT that did not work due to the limitation of the online peak detection. The global signal regression, white matter/ventricle signal regression, and RETORICOR had a distinctive noise reduction effect, depending on the target signal, and could not substitute for each other. Global signal regression could eliminate the noise-associated bias in the mean dynamic functional connectivity across time.\n\nSignificanceThe results indicate that extensive real-time denoising is possible and highly recommended for real-time fMRI applications.",

    "abstract": "Desmosomes, strong cell-cell junctions of epithelia and cardiac muscle, link intermediate filaments to cell membranes and mechanically integrate cells across tissues, dissipating mechanical stress. They comprise 5 major protein classes - desmocollins and desmogleins (the desmosomal cadherins), plakoglobin, plakophilins and desmoplakin - whose individual contribution to the structure and turnover of desmosomes is poorly understood. Using live-cell imaging together with FRAP and FLAP we show that desmosomes consist of two contrasting protein fractions or modules: a very stable desmosomal core of desmosomal cadherins and plakoglobin, and a highly mobile plakophilin. As desmosomes mature from calcium-dependence to calciumindependent hyper-adhesion, core stability increases, but Pkp2a remains highly mobile. Desmoplakin is initially mobile but stabilises with hyper-adhesion. We show that desmosome down-regulation during growth factor-induced cell scattering proceeds by internalisation of whole desmosomes, which still retain a stable core and highly mobile Pkp2a. This molecular mobility of Pkp2a suggests a transient and probably regulatory role for Pkp2a in the desmosome.",

Despite remarkable advances that have been made in understanding the regulation of gene expression during retinal development, how translational regulation guides retinogenesis is less understood. Here, we conduct a comprehensive translatome and transcriptome survey to the mouse retinogenesis from the embryonic to the adult stages. We discover thousands of genes that have dynamic changes at the translational level and pervasive translational regulation in a developmental stage-specific manner with specific biological functions. We further identify genes whose translational efficiencies are frequently controlled by changing usage in the upstream open reading frames during retinal development. These genes are enriched for biological functions highly important to neurons, such as neuron projection organization and microtubule-based protein transport. Surprisingly, we discover hundreds of previously uncharacterized micropeptides, translated from putative long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs. We validate their protein products in vitro and in vivo and demonstrate their potentials in regulating retinal development. Together, our study presents a rich and complex landscape of translational regulation and provides novel insights into their roles during retinogenesis.",
