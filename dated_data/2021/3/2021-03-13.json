    "abstract": "Cell death is a critical process that occurs normally in health and disease. However, its study is limited due to available technologies that only detect very late stages in the process or specific death mechanisms. Here, we report the development of a new fluorescent biosensor called genetically encoded death indicator (GEDI). GEDI specifically detects an intracellular Ca2+ level that cells achieve early in the cell death process and marks a stage at which cells are irreversibly committed to die. The time-resolved nature of GEDI delineates a binary demarcation of cell life and death in real time, reformulating the definition of cell death. We demonstrate that GEDI acutely and accurately reports death of rodent and human neurons in vitro, and show GEDI enables a novel automated imaging platform for single cell detection of neuronal death in vivo in zebrafish larvae. With a quantitative pseudo-ratiometric signal, GEDI facilitates high-throughput analysis of cell death in time lapse imaging analysis, providing the necessary resolution and scale to identify early factors leading to cell death in studies of neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Linear B-cell epitope prediction research has received a steadily growing interest ever since the first method was developed in 1981. B-cell epitope identification with the help of an accurate prediction method can lead to an overall faster and cheaper vaccine design process, a crucial necessity in the covid-19 era. Consequently, several B-cell epitope prediction methods have been developed over the past few decades, but without significant success. In this study, we review the current performance and methodology of some of the most widely used linear B-cell epitope predictors which are available via a command-line interface, namely BcePred, BepiPred, ABCpred, COBEpro, SVMTriP, LBtope, and LBEEP. Additionally, we attempted to remedy performance issues of the individual methods by developing a consensus classifier, which combines the separate predictions of these methods into a single output, accelerating the epitope-based vaccine design. While the method comparison was performed with some necessary caveats and individual methods might perform much better for specialized datasets, we hope that this update in performance can aid researchers towards the choice of a predictor, for the development of biomedical applications such as designed vaccines, diagnostic kits, immunotherapeutics, immunodiagnostic tests, antibody production, and disease diagnosis and therapy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMature microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in repressing the expression of a wide range of mRNAs. The variability of miRNA genes and their corresponding 3UTR binding sites might disrupt canonical conserved miRNA-mRNA pairing, thus modifying gene expression patterns. The presence of polymorphic sites in miRNA genes and their association with gene expression phenotypes and complex traits has been poorly characterized in pigs so far.\n\nResultsBy analyzing whole-genome sequences from 120 pigs and wild boars from Europe and Asia, we have identified 285 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping to miRNA loci, as well as 109,724 SNPs located in predicted 7mer-m8 miRNA binding sites within porcine 3UTRs. Porcine miRNA genes show a reduced SNP density compared with their flanking non-miRNA regions. By sequencing the genomes of 5 Duroc boars, we have identified 12 miRNA SNPs that have been subsequently genotyped in their offspring (N = 345, Lipgen population). Association analyses between miRNA SNPs and 38 lipid-related traits as well as hepatic and muscle microarray expression phenotypes recorded in the Lipgen population were carried out. The most relevant association detected was the one between the genotype of the rs319154814 (G/A) SNP located in the apical loop of the ssc-miR-326 hairpin precursor and PPP1CC mRNA levels in the liver (q-value = 0.058). This result was subsequently confirmed by qPCR (P-value = 0.027). The rs319154814 (G/A) genotype was also associated with several fatty acid composition traits.\n\nConclusionsPorcine miRNA genes show a reduced variability consistent with strong purifying selection, particularly in the seed region, which plays a critical role in miRNA binding. Although it is generally assumed that SNPs mapping to the seed region are the ones with the strongest consequences on mRNA expression, we show that a SNP mapping to the apical region of ssc-miR-326 is significantly associated with the hepatic mRNA levels of the PPP1CC gene, one of its predicted targets. Although experimental confirmation of such interaction has been obtained in humans but not in pigs, this result highlights the need of further investigating the functional effects of miRNA polymorphisms located outside the seed region on gene expression in pigs.",

Signal from oligo-conjugated antibodies is quantified by high-throughput sequencing and is highly scalable and sensitive. In this study, we investigated the response of oligo-conjugated antibodies towards four variables: Concentration, staining volume, cell number at staining, and tissue. We find that staining with recommended antibody concentrations cause unnecessarily high background and that concentrations can be drastically reduced without loss of biological information. Reducing volume only affects antibodies targeting abundant epitopes used at low concentrations and is counteracted by reducing cell numbers. Adjusting concentrations increases signal, lowers background and reduces costs. Background signal can account for a major fraction of the total sequencing and is primarily derived from antibodies used at high concentrations. Together, this study provides new insight into the titration response and background of oligo-conjugated antibodies and offers concrete guidelines on how such panels can be improved.\n\nImpact statementOligo-conjugated antibodies are a powerful tool but require thorough optimization to reduce background signal, increase sensitivity, and reduce sequencing costs.",

Currently, the most common approach has been to construct a \"protein tree\", as a surrogate for the organism tree, by Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of highly homologous regions of a set of select proteins to represent each organism. However, such selected regions account for a very small fraction of the whole-proteome of each organism.\n\nInformation Theory provides a method of comparing two sets of all proteins, two whole-proteomes, without MSA: By treating each whole-proteome sequence as a \"book\" of amino acid alphabets, the information contents of two whole-proteomes can be quantitatively compared using the text comparison method of the theory, without sequence alignment, providing an opportunity to construct a \"whole-proteome tree\" of insects as a surrogate for an organism tree of insects.\n\nA whole-proteome tree of the insects in this study shows that: (a) all the founders of the major groups of the insects have emerged in an explosive \"burst\" near the root of the tree, (b) the most basal group of all the insects is a subgroup of Hemiptera consisting of aphids and psyllids, and (c) there are other notable differences in the phylogeny of the groups compared to those of the recent protein trees of insects.",

To protect astronauts venturing out beyond Earths protective magnetosphere, advanced passive radiation protection is highly sought after. In search of innovative radiation-shields, biotechnology appeals with suitability for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), self-regeneration, and adaptability.\n\nCertain fungi thrive in high-radiation environments on Earth, such as the contamination radius of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. Analogous to photosynthesis, these organisms appear to perform radiosynthesis, utilizing ionizing radiation to generate chemical energy. It has been postulated that the absorption of radiation is attributable to the pigment melanin. It is further hypothesized that this phenomenon translates to radiation-shielding properties.\n\nHere, growth of Cladosporium sphaerospermum and its capability to attenuate ionizing radiation, was studied aboard the International Space Station (ISS) over a period of 26 days, as an analog to habitation on the surface of Mars.

Nevertheless, cell death is difficult to detect without perturbing experiments with stains, dyes or biosensors that can bias experimental outcomes, lead to inconsistent results, and reduce the number of processes that can be simultaneously labelled. These additional steps also make live microscopy difficult to scale for high-throughput screening because of the cost, labor, and analysis they entail. We address this fundamental limitation of live microscopy with biomarker-optimized convolutional neural networks (BO-CNN): computer vision models trained with a ground truth biosensor that detect live cells with superhuman, 96% accuracy more than 100 times faster than previous methods. Our models learn to identify important morphological characteristics associated with cell vitality without human input or additional perturbations, and to generalize to other imaging modalities and cell types for which they have no specialized training. We demonstrate that we can interpret decisions from BO-CNN models to gain biological insight into the patterns they use to achieve superhuman accuracy. The BO-CNN approach is broadly useful for live microscopy, and affords a powerful new paradigm for advancing the state of high-throughput imaging in a variety of contexts.",

The time scale of this killing is often comparable with the bacterial generation time before addition of antibiotics. Yet, a small subpopulation typically survives for an extended period. However, the long-term killing dynamics of bacterial cells has not been fully quantified even in well-controlled laboratory conditions. We constructed a week-long killing assay and followed the survival fraction of Escherichia coli K12 exposed to a high concentration of ciprofloxacin. We found that long-term survivors were formed during exponential growth, with some cells surviving at least 7 days. The long-term dynamics contained at least three timescales, which greatly enhances predictions of the population survival time compared to the biphasic extrapolation from the short term behavior. Furthermore, we observed a surprisingly long memory effect of a brief carbon starvation pulse, which was dependent on the (p)ppGpp synthase relA. Specifically, one hour of carbon starvation prior to antibiotics exposure increased the surviving fraction by nearly 100-fold even after 4 days of ciprofloxacin treatment.",

    "abstract": "In polarized epithelial cells, receptor-ligand interactions can be restricted by different spatial distributions of the two interacting components, giving rise to an underappreciated layer of regulatory complexity. We explored whether such regulation occurs in the Drosophila wing disc, an epithelial tissue that requires the TGF-{beta} family member Dpp for growth and patterning. Dpp protein has been observed in a gradient within the columnar cells of the disc, but also uniformly in the disc lumen, leading to the question of how graded signaling is achieved in the face of two distinctly localized pools. We find the Dpp type II receptor Punt, but not the type I receptor Tkv, is enriched at the basolateral membrane, and depleted at the junctions and apical surface. Wit, a second type II receptor, shows a markedly different behavior, with the protein detected on all membrane regions but enriched at the apical side. Mutational studies identified the BLT, a short juxtamembrane sequence required for basolateral targeting of Punt in both wing discs and mammalian MDCK cells, and that dominantly confers basolateral localization on an otherwise apical receptor. Rescue of punt mutants with transgenes altered in the targeting motif showed that flies expressing apicalized Punt due to the lack of a functional BLT displayed developmental defects, female sterility and significant lethality. We also show that apicalized Punt does not produce an ectopic signal, indicating that the apical pool of Dpp is not a significant signaling source even when presented with Punt. Finally, we present evidence that the BLT acts through polarized sorting machinery that differs between types of epithelia. This suggests a code whereby each epithelial cell type may differentially traffic common receptors to enable distinctive responses to spatially localized pools of extracellular ligands.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies showed that corticospinal excitability (CSE) is modulated during observation of object lifting, an effect termed  motor resonance. Specifically, motor resonance is driven by movement features indicating object weight, such as object size or observed movement kinematics. We investigated in 16 humans (8 females) whether motor resonance is also modulated by an objects weight distribution. Participants were asked to lift an inverted T-shaped manipulandum with interchangeable center of mass after first observing an actor lift the same manipulandum. Participants and actor were instructed to minimize object roll and rely on constrained digit positioning during lifting. Constrained positioning was either collinear (i.e., fingertips on the same height) or noncollinear (i.e., fingertip on the heavy side higher than the one on the light side). The center of mass changed unpredictably before the actors lifts and participants were explained that their weight distribution always matched the actors one. Last, TMS was applied during both lift observation and planning of lift actions. Our results showed that CSE was similarly modulated during lift observation and planning: when participants observed or planned lifts in which the weight distribution was asymmetrically right-sided, CSE recorded from the thumb muscles was significantly increased compared to when the weight distribution was left-sided. During both lift observation and planning, this increase seemed to be primarily driven by the weight distribution and not specifically by the (observed) digit positioning or muscle contraction. In conclusion, our results indicate that complex intrinsic object properties such as weight distributions can modulate activation of the motor system during both observation and planning of lifting actions.\n\nHighlights* Motor resonance is observation-induced activity in the observers motor system\n* We used a dyadic lifting task of objects with asymmetrical weight distribution\n* We investigated which movement features modulate motor resonance\n* Motor resonance is modulated by the objects weight distribution\n* Motor resonance is driven by observed and planned digit positioning",

At the single-cell level, timer mechanisms can be implemented with genetic circuits: sets of genes connected to achieve specific tasks. However, such systems are difficult to implement in single cells due to saturation in molecular components and stochasticity in the limited intracellular space. Multicellular implementations, on the other hand, outsource some of the components of information-processing circuits to the extracellular space, and thereby might escape those constraints. Here we develop a theoretical framework, based on a trilinear coordinate representation, to study the collective behavior of a cellular population composed of three cell types under stationary conditions. This framework reveals that distributing different processes (in our case the production, detection and degradation of a time-encoding signal) across distinct cell types enables the robust implementation of a multicellular timer. Our analysis also shows the circuit to be easily tunable by varying the cellular composition of the consortium.",

    "abstract": "The mapping from protein sequence to function is highly complex, making it challenging to predict how sequence changes will affect a proteins behavior and properties. We present a supervised deep learning framework to learn the sequence-function mapping from deep mutational scanning data and make predictions for new, uncharacterized sequence variants. We test multiple neural network architectures, including a graph convolutional network that incorporates protein structure, to explore how a networks internal representation affects its ability to learn the sequence-function mapping. Our supervised learning approach displays superior performance over physics-based and unsupervised prediction methods. We find networks that capture nonlinear interactions and share parameters across sequence positions are important for learning the relationship between sequence and function. Further analysis of the trained models reveals the networks ability to learn biologically meaningful information about protein structure and mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate the models ability to navigate sequence space and design new proteins beyond the training set. We applied the GB1 models to design a sequence that binds to IgG with substantially higher affinity than wild-type GB1. Our software is available from https://github.com/gitter-lab/nn4dms.\n\nSignificanceUnderstanding the relationship between protein sequence and function is necessary to design new and useful proteins with applications in bioenergy, medicine, and agriculture. The mapping from sequence to function is tremendously complex because it involves thousands of molecular interactions that are coupled over multiple lengths and timescales. In this work, we show neural networks can learn the sequence-function mapping from large protein datasets. Neural networks are appealing for this task because they can learn complicated relationships from data, make few assumptions about the nature of the sequencefunction relationship, and can learn general rules that apply across the length of the protein sequence. We demonstrate the learned models can be applied to design new proteins with properties that exceed natural sequences.",

    "abstract": "Microbial ecosystems harbor an astonishing diversity that can persist for long times. To understand how such diversity is structured and maintained, ecological and evolutionary processes need to be integrated at similar timescales. Here, we study a model of resource competition that allows for evolution via de novo mutation, and focus on rapidly adapting asexual populations with large mutational inputs, as typical of many bacteria species. We characterize the adaptation and diversification of an initially maladapted population and show how the eco-evolutionary dynamics are shaped by the interaction between simultaneously emerging lineages - clonal interference. We find that in large populations, more intense clonal interference fosters diversification under sympatry, increasing the probability that phenotypically and genetically distinct clusters stably coexist. In smaller populations, the accumulation of deleterious and compensatory mutations can push further the diversification process and kick-start speciation. Our findings have implications beyond microbial populations, providing novel insights about the interplay between ecology and evolution in clonal populations.",

    "abstract": "Ageing disrupts the finely tuned excitation/inhibition balance (E:I) across cortex, driven by a natural decline in inhibitory tone ({gamma}-amino butyric acid, GABA). This causes functional decrements. However, in young adults, experimentally lowering GABA in sensorimotor cortex enhances adaptation memory. Therefore, using a cross-sectional design, here we tested the hypothesis that as sensorimotor cortical GABA declines naturally with age, adaptation memory would increase, and the former would explain the latter. Results confirmed this prediction. To probe causality, we used brain stimulation to further lower sensorimotor cortical GABA during adaptation. Across individuals, how stimulation changed memory depended on sensorimotor cortical E:I. In those with low E:I, stimulation increased memory; in those with high E:I stimulation reduced memory. Thus, we identify a form of motor memory that improves naturally with age, depends causally on sensorimotor cortex neurochemistry, and may be a potent target for motor skill preservation strategies in healthy ageing and neurore-habilitation.",

Methionine addiction results from the overuse of methionine by cancer cells for excess transmethylation reactions. In order to identify excess transmethylation reactions in cancer and further understand the basis of methionine addiction, we compared the histone H3 lysine-methylation status and malignancy between methionine-addicted cancer cells and their methionine-independent revertants which have regained the ability to grow on low levels of methionine or independently of exogenous methionine. The levels of trimethylated histone H3 lysine marks were reduced in methionine-independent revertants compared to parental cancer cells in vitro. Tumorigenicity and experimental metastatic potential in nude mice were also highly reduced in the methionine-independent revertants compared to the parental cells.

    "abstract": "Recent laminar-fMRI studies have substantially improved understanding of the evoked cortical responses in multiple sub-systems; in contrast, the laminar component of resting-state networks spread over the whole brain has been less studied due to technical limitations. Animal research strongly suggests that the supragranular layers of the cortex play a critical role in maintaining communication within the default mode network (DMN); however, whether this is true in this and other human cortical networks remains unclear. Here, we used EPIK, which offers unprecedented coverage at sub-millimeter resolution, to investigate cortical broad resting-state dynamics with depth specificity in healthy volunteers. Our results suggest that human DMN connectivity is primarily supported by intermediate and superficial layers of the cortex, and furthermore, the preferred cortical depth used for communication can vary from one network to another. This has major implications for the characterization of network-related diseases and should occupy future high-resolution studies. In addition, the laminar connectivity profile of some networks showed a tendency to change upon engagement in a motor task. In line with these connectivity changes, we observed that the amplitude of the low-frequency-fluctuations (ALFF), as well as the regional homogeneity (ReHo), exhibited a different laminar slope when subjects were either performing a task or were in a resting state (less variation among laminae, i.e., lower slope, during task performance compared to rest). The varied laminar profiles concerning network connectivity, ALFF, and ReHo, observed across two brain states (task vs. rest) suggest the potential diagnostic value of laminar fMRI in psychiatric diseases, e.g., to differentiate the cortical dynamics associated with disease stages linked, or not linked, to behavioral changes. The evaluation of laminar-fMRI across the brain encompasses computational challenges; nonetheless, it enables the investigation of a new dimension of the human neocortex, which may be key to understanding neurological disorders from a novel perspective.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCluster analysis is an integral part of precision medicine and systems biology, used to define groups of patients or biomolecules. Consensus clustering is an ensemble approach that is widely used in these areas, which combines the output from multiple runs of a non-deterministic clustering algorithm. Here we consider the application of consensus clustering to a broad class of heuristic clustering algorithms that can be derived from Bayesian mixture models (and extensions thereof) by adopting an early stopping criterion when performing sampling-based inference for these models. While the resulting approach is non-Bayesian, it inherits the usual benefits of consensus clustering, particularly in terms of computational scalability and providing assessments of clustering stability/robustness.\n\nIn simulation studies, we show that our approach can successfully uncover the target clustering structure, while also exploring different plausible clusterings of the data. We show that, when a parallel computation environment is available, our approach offers significant reductions in runtime compared to performing sampling-based Bayesian inference for the underlying model, while retaining many of the practical benefits of the Bayesian approach, such as exploring different numbers of clusters. We propose a heuristic to decide upon ensemble size and the early stopping criterion, and then apply consensus clustering to a clustering algorithm derived from a Bayesian integrative clustering method. We use the resulting approach to perform an integrative analysis of three  omics datasets for budding yeast and find clusters of co-expressed genes with shared regulatory proteins. We validate these clusters using data external to the analysis. These clusters can help assign likely function to understudied genes, for example GAS3 clusters with histones active in S-phase, suggesting a role in DNA replication.\n\nOur approach can be used as a wrapper for essentially any existing sampling-based Bayesian clustering implementation, and enables meaningful clustering analyses to be performed using such implementations, even when computational Bayesian inference is not feasible, e.g. due to poor exploration of the target density (often as a result of increasing numbers of features) or a limited computational budget that does not along sufficient samples to drawn from a single chain. This enables researchers to straightforwardly extend the applicability of existing software to much larger datasets, including implementations of sophisticated models such as those that jointly model multiple datasets.",

    "abstract": "Brucella ovis is an ovine intracellular pathogen with tropism for the male genital tract. To establish and maintain infection, B. ovis must survive stressful conditions inside host cells, including low pH, nutrient limitation, and reactive oxygen species. These same conditions are often encountered in axenic cultures during stationary phase. Studies of stationary phase may thus inform understanding of Brucella infection biology, yet the genes and pathways that are important in Brucella stationary phase physiology remain poorly defined. We measured fitness of a barcoded pool of B. ovis Tn-himar mutants as a function of growth phase and identified cysE as a determinant of fitness in stationary phase. CysE catalyzes the first step in cysteine biosynthesis from serine, and we provide genetic evidence that two related enzymes, CysK1 and CysK2, function redundantly to catalyze cysteine synthesis at steps downstream of CysE. Deleting either cysE ({Delta}cysE) or both cysK1 and cysK2 ({Delta}cysK1 {Delta}cysK2) results in premature entry into stationary phase, reduced culture yield and sensitivity to exogenous hydrogen peroxide. These phenotypes can be chemically complemented by cysteine or glutathione. {Delta}cysE and {Delta}cysK1 {Delta}cysK2 strains have no defect in host cell entry in vitro but have significantly diminished intracellular fitness between 2 and 24 hours post infection. Our study has uncovered unexpected redundancy at the CysK step of cysteine biosynthesis in B. ovis, and demonstrates that cysteine anabolism is a determinant of peroxide stress survival and fitness in the intracellular niche.",

Dengue and Zika virus infections have been linked to antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders including Guillain-Barre syndrome. A unique feature of flaviviruses is the secretion of non-structural protein 1 (NS1) by infected cells. NS1 is highly immunogenic and antibodies targeting NS1 can have both protective and pathogenic roles. In the present study, we investigated the humoral immune response to Zika virus NS1 and found NS1 to be an immunodominant viral antigen associated with the presence of autoreactive antibodies. Through single B cell cultures, we coupled binding assays and BCR sequencing, confirming the immunodominance of NS1. Of note, we demonstrate the presence of self-reactive clones in germinal centers after both infection and immunization, some of which clones presenting cross-reactivity with NS1. Sequence analysis of anti-NS1 B cell clones showed sequence features associated with pathogenic autoreactive antibodies. Our findings demonstrate NS1 immunodominance at the cellular level as well as a potential role for NS1 in ZIKV associated autoimmune manifestations.",

    "abstract": "In silico, cell based approaches for modeling biological morphogenesis are used to test and validate our understanding of the biological and mechanical process that are at work during the growth and the organization of multi-cell tissues. As compared to in vivo experiments, computer based frameworks dedicated to tissue modeling allow us to easily test different hypotheses, and to quantify the impact of various biophysically relevant parameters.\n\nHere, we propose a formalism based on a detailed, yet simple, description of cells that accounts for intra-, inter- and extra-cellular mechanisms. More precisely, the cell growth and division is described through the space and time evolution of the membrane vertices. These vertices follow a Newtonian dynamics, meaning that their evolution is con-trolled by different types of forces: a membrane force (spring and bending), an adherence force (inter-cellular spring), external and internal pressure forces. Different evolution laws can be applied on the internal pressure, depending on the intra-cellular mechanism of interest. In addition to the cells dynamics, our formalism further relies on a lattice Boltzmann method, using the Palabos library, to simulate the diffusion of chemical signals. The latter aims at driving the growth and migration of a tissue by simply changing the state of the cells.\n\nAll of this leads to an accurate description of the growth and division of cells, with realistic cell shapes and where membranes can have different properties. While this work is mainly of methodological nature, we also propose to validate our framework through simple, yet biologically relevant benchmark tests at both single-cell and full tissue scales. This includes free and chemically controlled cell tissue growth in an unbounded domain. The ability of our framework to simulate cell migration, cell compression and morphogenesis under external constraints is also investigated in a qualitative manner.",

For over thirty years, TGF-{beta} ligands have been known to induce cytostasis in a large variety of epithelia, but the intracellular pathway mediating this signal in the prostate, as well as its relevance for quiescence, have remained elusive.\n\nHere, using mouse prostate organoids to model epithelial progenitors, we found that intra-epithelial non-canonical Activin A signalling inhibited cell proliferation in a Smad-independent manner. Mechanistically, Activin A triggered Tak1 and p38 MAPK activity, leading to p16 and p21 nuclear import. Spontaneous evasion from this quiescent state occurred upon prolonged culture, due to reduced Activin A secretion, a condition associated with DNA replication stress and aneuploidy. Organoids capable to escape quiescence in vitro were also able to implant with increased frequency into immunocompetent mice.\n\nOur study demonstrates that non-canonical Activin A signalling safeguards epithelial quiescence in the healthy prostate, with potential implications for the understanding of cancer initiation, and the development of therapies targeting quiescent tumour progenitors.",

    "abstract": "Recently, it has become progressively more evident that classic diagnostic labels are unable to accurately and reliably describe the complexity and variability of several clinical phenotypes. This is particularly true for a broad range of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as depression and anxiety disorders or behavioural phenotypes such as aggression and antisocial personality. Patient heterogeneity can be better described and conceptualized by grouping individuals into novel categories, which are based on empirically-derived sections of intersecting continua that span both across and beyond traditional categorical borders. In this context, neuroimaging data carry a wealth of spatiotemporally resolved information about each patients brain. However, they are usually heavily collapsed a priori through procedures which are not learned as part of model training, and consequently not optimized for the downstream prediction task. This is due to the fact that every individual participant usually comes with multiple whole-brain 3D imaging modalities often accompanied by a deep genotypic and phenotypic characterization, hence posing formidable computational challenges.\n\nIn this paper we design and validate a deep learning architecture based on generative models rooted in a modular approach and separable convolutional blocks (which result in a 20-fold decrease in parameter utilization) in order to a) fuse multiple 3D neuroimaging modalities on a voxel-wise level, b) efficiently convert them into informative latent embeddings through heavy dimensionality reduction, c) maintain excellent generalizability and minimal information loss. As proof of concept, we test our architecture on the well characterized Human Connectome Project database (n=974 healthy subjects), demonstrating that our latent embeddings can be clustered into easily separable subject strata which, in turn, map to extremely different phenotypical information (including organic, neuropsychological, personality variables) which was not included in the embedding creation process.\n\nThe ability to extract meaningful and separable phenotypic information from brain images alone can aid in creating multi-dimensional biomarkers able to chart spatio-temporal trajectories which may correspond to different pathophysiological mechanisms unidentifiable to traditional data analysis approaches. In turn, this may be of aid in predicting disease evolution as well as drug response, hence supporting mechanistic disease understanding and also empowering clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionDNA-based surveillance of bacterial diseases has been using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) since 1996. Currently, the international surveillance network (PulseNet international) is turning toward whole genome sequencing (WGS). ATCGs of WGS are compared using several sequence alignment methods. While patterns of horizontal lines of PFGE profiles are being compared using relative positioning of bands within a range of tolerance. A recently suggested image analysis algorithm and a deployed database (geltowgs.uofk.edu) collectively invented a promising method for comparing PFGE to in-silico obtained digestion models (DMs) derived from WGS. The database requires a parameter that determines PFGE resolution. Here, the author suggests a new method for calculating this factor. Epidemiological and molecular conclusions returned by the database are evaluated.\n\nMethodologytwo PFGE profiles representing XbaI digests of E. coli and Salmonella enterica analyzed by the suggested image analysis algorithm were submitted to the database after calculating resolution of PFGE using Dice percentage of difference between the closest PFGE bands in length. E. coli and Salmonella enterica test subjects were compared to 489 and 401 DMs respectively. The three data sets returned were analyzed.\n\nResults and conclusionsaccording to modified PFGE evaluation criteria; a single DM is possibly related to E. coli test subject. It belonged to the same serovar. No epidemiologically related DM was shown for S. enterica test subject. Conclusions mentioned earlier could never be made ignoring co-migration. Standardization of both; suggested image analysis and database algorithms will deepen our understanding of bacterial epidemiology by means of possible qualitative approach built upon identification of fragment sequences and their locations within chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "Papaya (Carica papaya Linn.) is a tropical plant whose draft genome has been sequenced. Papaya produces large fruits rich in vitamins A and C and is an important cash crop in developing countries. Nonetheless, little is known about how the female gametophyte develops, how it is fertilized and how it develops into a mature seed containing an embryo and an endosperm. The Papaya female gametophyte displays a Polygonum-type architecture consisting of two synergid cells, an egg cell, a central cell, and three antipodal cells. Reports are available of the presumed existence of varieties in which cross fertilization is bypassed and autonomous development of embryos occurs (e.g., apomixis). In this study, we analyzed the development of female gametophytes in a commercial Hawaiian parental line and in the presumed apomictic Costa Rican line L1. Samples were collected before and after anthesis to compare the overall structure, size and transcriptional patterns of several genes that may be involved in egg and endosperm cell fate and proliferation. These genes were the putative papaya homologs of ARGONAUTE9 (AGO9), MEDEA (MEA), RETINOBLASTOMA RELATED-1 (RBR1), and SLOW WALKER-1 (SWA1). Our results suggest that its feasibly to identify structural features of Polygonum-type development, and that in bagged female flowers of line L1 we might have observed autonomous development of embryo-like structures. Possible downregulation of papaya homologs for AGO9, MEA, RBR1 and SWA1 was observed in embryo sacs from line L1 before and after anthesis, which may suggest a link between suspected apomixis and transcriptional downregulation of genes for RNA-directed DNA methylation, histone remodelers, and rRNA processing. Most notably, the large size of the papaya embryo sac suggests that it could be a cytological alternative to Arabidopsis thaliana for study. Significant variation in embryo sac size was observed between the varieties under study, suggesting wide differences in the genetic regulation of anatomical features.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, deep neural network (DNN) models have received a lot of attention due to their near-human object classification performance and their excellent prediction of signals recorded from biological visual systems. To better understand the function of these networks and relate them to hypotheses about brain activity and behavior, researchers need to extract the activations to images across different DNN layers. The abundance of different DNN variants, however, can often be unwieldy, and the task of extracting DNN activations from different layers may be non-trivial and error-prone for someone without a strong computational background. Thus, researchers in the fields of cognitive science and computational neuroscience would benefit from a library or package that supports a user in the extraction task. THINGSvision is a new Python module that aims at closing this gap by providing a simple and unified tool for extracting layer activations for a wide range of pretrained and randomly-initialized neural network architectures, even for users with little to no programming experience. We demonstrate the general utility of THINGsvision by relating extracted DNN activations to a number of functional MRI and behavioral datasets using representational similarity analysis, which can be performed as an integral part of the toolbox. Together, THINGSvision enables researchers across diverse fields to extract features in a streamlined manner for their custom image dataset, thereby improving the ease of relating DNNs, brain activity, and behavior, and improving the reproducibility of findings in these research fields.",

    "abstract": "During development, homeostasis, and disease, organisms must balance responses that allow adaptation to low oxygen (hypoxia) with those that protect cells from oxidative stress. The evolutionarily conserved hypoxia-inducible factors are central to these processes, as they orchestrate transcriptional responses to oxygen deprivation. Here, we employ genetic strategies in C. elegans to identify stress-responsive genes and pathways that modulate the HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor and facilitate oxygen homeostasis. Through a genome-wide RNAi screen, we show that RNAi-mediated mitochondrial or proteasomal dysfunction increases the expression of hypoxia-responsive reporter Pnhr-57:GFP in C. elegans. Interestingly, only a subset of these effects requires hif-1. Of particular importance, we found that skn-1 RNAi increases the expression of hypoxia-responsive reporter Pnhr-57:GFP and elevates HIF-1 protein levels. The SKN-1/NRF transcription factor has been shown to promote oxidative stress resistance. We present evidence that the crosstalk between HIF-1 and SKN-1 is mediated by EGL-9, the prolyl hydroxylase that targets HIF-1 for oxygen-dependent degradation. Treatment that induces SKN-1, such as heat, increases expression of a Pegl-9:GFP reporter, and this effect requires skn-1 function and a putative SKN-1 binding site in egl-9 regulatory sequences. Collectively, these data support a model in which SKN-1 promotes egl-9 transcription, thereby inhibiting HIF-1. We propose that this interaction enables animals to adapt quickly to changes in cellular oxygenation and to better survive accompanying oxidative stress.",

We previously suggested a stochastic etiologic model where small-scale random perturbations could reach a threshold for MS development. The recently described mapping of the transient transcriptome (TT), including intergenic and intronic RNAs, seems appropriate to verify this model through a rigorous colocalization analysis. We show that genomic regions coding for the TT were significantly enriched for MS-associated GWAS variants and DNA binding sites for molecular transducers mediating putative, non-genetic, etiopathogenetic factors for MS (e.g., vitamin D deficiency, Epstein Barr virus latent infection, B cell dysfunction). These results suggest a model whereby TT-coding regions are hotspots of convergence between genetic ad non-genetic factors of risk/protection for MS, and plausibly for other complex disorders. Our colocalization analysis also provides a freely available data resource (www.mscoloc.com) for future research on MS transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "Host genetic landscapes can shape microbiome assembly in the animal gut by contributing to the establishment of distinct physiological environments. However, the genetic determinants contributing to the stability and variation of these microbiome types remain largely undefined. Here, we use the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to identify natural genetic variation among wild strains of C. elegans strains that drives assembly of distinct microbiomes. To achieve this, we first established a diverse model microbiome that represents the phylogenetic and functional diversity naturally found in the C. elegans microbiome. Using this community, we show that C. elegans utilizes immune, xenobiotic and metabolic signaling pathways to favor the assembly of different microbiome types. Variations in these pathways were associated with the enrichment for specific commensals, including the Alphaproteobacteria Ochrobactrum. Using RNAi and mutant strains, we showed that host selection for Ochrobactrum is mediated specifically by host insulin signaling pathways. Ochrobactrum recruitment is blunted in the absence of daf-2/IGFR and requires the insulin signaling transcription factors daf-16/FOXO and pqm-1/SALL2. Further, the ability of C. elegans to enrich for Ochrobactrum is correlated positively with host outcomes, as animals that develop faster are larger and have higher gut Ochrobactrum colonization as adults. These results highlight a new role for the highly conserved insulin signaling pathways in the regulation of microbiome composition in C. elegans.",

Using a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell model system with relevance to cancer therapy, we studied signaling dynamics at single cell resolution. We found that the spatial arrangement of receptors determines the ligand density threshold for triggering and encodes the temporal kinetics of signaling activities. We also showed that signaling sensitivity of a small cluster of high-affinity ligands is enhanced when surrounded by non-stimulating low-affinity ligands. Our results suggest that cells measure spatial arrangements of ligands and translates that information into distinct signaling dynamics, and provide insights into engineering new immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "In many models of evolving populations, genetic drift has an outsized role relative to natural selection, or vice versa. While there are many scenarios in which one of these two assumptions is reasonable, intermediate balances between these forces are also biologically relevant. In this study, we consider some natural axioms for modeling intermediate selection intensities, and we explore how to quantify the long-term evolutionary dynamics of such a process. To illustrate the sensitivity of evolutionary dynamics to drift and selection, we show that there can be a \"sweet spot\" for the balance of these two forces, with sufficient noise for rare mutants to become established and sufficient selection to spread. This balance allows prosocial traits to evolve in evolutionary models that were previously thought to be unconducive to the emergence and spread of altruistic behaviors. Furthermore, the effects of selection intensity on long-run evolutionary outcomes in these settings, such as when there is global competition for reproduction, can be highly non-monotonic. Although intermediate selection intensities (neither weak nor strong) are notoriously difficult to study analytically, they are often biologically relevant; and the results we report suggest that they can elicit novel and rich dynamics in the evolution of prosocial behaviors.\n\nAuthor summaryTheoretical models of populations have been useful for assessing when and how traits spread, in large part because they are simple. Rather than being used to reproduce empirical data, these idealized models involve relatively few parameters and are utilized to gain a qualitative understanding of what promotes or suppresses a trait. For prosocial traits, which entail a cost to self to help another, one thing that mathematical models often suggest is that competition to reproduce must be localized, meaning an individual must be fitter than just a small subset of the population in order to produce an offspring. We show here that this finding is not robust. Such traits can indeed proliferate when there is global competition for reproduction, which we demonstrate by increasing the degree to which fitness affects birth rates. Since this kind of \"stronger selection\" has also been observed empirically, we discuss how it is incorporated into theoretical models more broadly.",

    "abstract": "Alteration of antibiotic binding sites through modification of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a common form of resistance to ribosome-targeting antibiotics. The rRNA-modifying enzyme Cfr methylates an adenosine nucleotide within the peptidyl transferase center, resulting in the C-8 methylation of A2503 (m8A2503). Acquisition of cfr results in resistance to eight classes of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. Despite the prevalence of this resistance mechanism, it is poorly understood whether and how bacteria modulate Cfr methylation to adapt to antibiotic pressure. Moreover, direct evidence for how m8A2503 alters antibiotic binding sites within the ribosome is lacking. In this study, we performed directed evolution of Cfr under antibiotic selection to generate Cfr variants that confer increased resistance by enhancing methylation of A2503 in cells. Increased rRNA methylation is achieved by improved expression and stability of Cfr through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, which may be exploited by pathogens under antibiotic stress as suggested by natural isolates. Using a variant which achieves near-stoichiometric methylation of rRNA, we determined a 2.2 [A] cryo-EM structure of the Cfr-modified ribosome. Our structure reveals the molecular basis for broad resistance to antibiotics and will inform the design of new antibiotics that overcome resistance mediated by Cfr.",

The effect of PP stimulation is enhanced when the hands and body are heated in a humid environment and at temperatures above 42 {degrees}C. Stimulation of PP by heating indicates the convergence of impulses from neurons of the lateral geniculate body (LGB) and nuclei of the thalamus, which are responsible for thermoreceptors in the skin of the palms and fingers. The thermal stimulation effect of PP is enhanced at temperatures above 42 {degrees}C due to the fact that thermoreceptors work as pain receptors.

Here, we used unbiased mass spectrometry based proteomics with data-driven protein network analysis to systematically characterize how HGSOC cells respond to PARP1i treatment. We found that PARP1i leads to pronounced proteomic changes in a diverse set of cellular processes in HGSOC cancer cells, consistent with transcript changes in an independent perturbation dataset. We interpret decreases in the levels of the pro-proliferative transcription factors SP1 and {beta}-catenin and in growth factor signaling as reflecting the anti-proliferative effect of PARP1i; and the strong activation of pro-survival processes NF-{varkappa}B signaling and lipid metabolism as PARPi-induced adaptive resistance mechanisms. Based on these observations, we nominate several protein targets for therapeutic inhibition in combination with PARP1i. When tested experimentally, the combination of PARPi with an inhibitor of fatty acid synthase (TVB-2640) has a 3-fold synergistic effect and is therefore of particular pre-clinical interest. Our study improves the current understanding of PARP1 function, highlights the potential that the anti-tumor efficacy of PARP1i may not only rely on DNA damage repair mechanisms and informs on the rational design of PARP1i combination therapies in ovarian cancer.",

Although more intricate models have the potential to reveal more details of the tissue, they also incur time-consuming parameter estimation that may con-verge to inaccurate solutions due to a prevalence of local minima in a degenerate fitting landscape. Machine-learning fitting algorithms have been proposed to accelerate the parameter estimation and increase the robustness of the attained estimates. So far, learning-based fitting approaches have been restricted to lower-dimensional microstructural models where dense sets of training data are easy to generate. Moreover, the degree to which machine learning can alleviate the degeneracy problem is poorly understood. For conventional least-squares solvers, it has been shown that degeneracy can be avoided by acquisition with optimized relaxation-diffusion-correlation protocols that include tensor-valued diffusion encoding; whether machine-learning techniques can offset these acquisition require-ments remains to be tested. In this work, we employ deep neural networks to vastly accelerate the fitting of a recently introduced high-dimensional relaxation-diffusion model of tissue microstructure. We also develop strategies for assessing the accuracy and sensitivity of function fitting networks and use those strategies to explore the impact of acquisition protocol design on the performance of the network. The developed learning-based fitting pipelines were tested on relaxation-diffusion data acquired with optimized and sub-sampled acquisition protocols. We found no evidence that machine-learning algorithms can by themselves replace a careful design of the acquisition protocol or correct for a degenerate fitting landscape.",

    "abstract": "Neural circuits within the frontal cortex support the flexible selection of goal-directed behaviors by integrating input from brain regions associated with sensory, emotional, episodic, and semantic memory functions. From a connectomics perspective, determining how these disparate afferent inputs target their synapses to specific cell types in the frontal cortex may prove crucial in understanding circuit-level information processing. Here, we used monosynaptic retrograde rabies mapping to examine the distribution of afferent neurons targeting four distinct classes of local inhibitory interneurons and four distinct classes of excitatory projection neurons in mouse infralimbic cortex. Interneurons expressing parvalbumin, somatostatin, or vasoactive intestinal peptide received a large proportion of inputs from hippocampal regions, while interneurons expressing neuron-derived neurotrophic factor received a large proportion of inputs from thalamic regions. A more moderate hippocampal-thalamic dichotomy was found among the inputs targeting excitatory neurons that project to the basolateral amygdala, lateral entorhinal cortex, nucleus reuniens of the thalamus, and the periaqueductal gray. Together, these results show a prominent bias among hippocampal and thalamic afferent systems in their targeting to genetically or anatomically defined sets of frontal cortical neurons. Moreover, they suggest the presence of two distinct local microcircuits that control how different inputs govern frontal cortical information processing.",

    "abstract": "Synchronous release at neuronal synapses is accomplished by a machinery that senses calcium influx and fuses the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes to release neurotransmitters. Previous studies suggested the calcium sensor Synaptotagmin (Syt) is a facilitator of vesicle docking and both a facilitator and inhibitor of fusion. On phospholipid monolayers, the Syt C2AB domain spontaneously oligomerized into rings that are disassembled by Ca2+, suggesting Syt rings may clamp fusion as membrane-separating \"washers\" until Ca2+-mediated disassembly triggers fusion and release (Wang et al., 2014). Here we combined mathematical modeling with experiment to measure mechanical properties of Syt rings and to test this mechanism. Consistent with experiment, the model quantitatively recapitulates observed Syt ring-induced dome and volcano shapes on phospholipid monolayers, and predicts rings are stabilized by anionic phospholipid bilayers or bulk solution with ATP. The selected ring conformation is highly sensitive to membrane composition and bulk ATP levels, a property that may regulate vesicle docking and fusion in ATP-rich synaptic terminals. We find the Syt molecules hosted by a synaptic vesicle oligomerize into a halo, unbound from the vesicle, but in proximity to sufficiently PIP2-rich plasma membrane (PM) domains the PM-bound trans Syt ring conformation is preferred. Thus, the Syt halo serves as landing gear for spatially directed docking at PIP2-rich sites that define the active zones of exocytotic release, positioning the Syt ring to clamp fusion and await calcium. Our results suggest the Syt ring is both a Ca2+-sensitive fusion clamp and a high-fidelity sensor for directed docking.\n\nSignificanceSynchronous neurotransmitter release relies on directed docking of synaptic vesicles at active zones in axon terminals, where calcium influx activates membrane fusion and release. In vitro, the calcium sensor Synaptotagmin oligomerizes into rings disassembled by calcium. Here, experiment and modeling suggest the Synaptotagmin molecules hosted by an undocked vesicle oligomerize into a tethered, unbound halo in ATP-rich synaptic terminals. The halo directs vesicle docking to PIP2-rich plasma membrane domains in active zones, where the trans-bound ring conformation is favored, interposed between the membranes to clamp fusion until calcium triggers ring disassembly and neurotransmitter release. The mechanism exploits the extreme sensitivity of Synaptotagmin ring binding preferences to solution and membrane composition, with ~15 -fold-enhanced sensitivity for rings of ~15 molecules.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in healthy B cell responses and the loss of tolerance in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), though the role of many miRNAs remains poorly understood. Dampening miR-21 activity was previously shown to reduce splenomegaly and blood urea nitrogen levels in SLE-prone mice, but the detailed cellular responses and mechanism of action remains unexplored. Herein, using the TLR7 agonist imiquimod-induced SLE model, we observed that loss of miR-21 in Sle1b mice prevented the formation of plasma cells and autoantibody forming cells (AFC), without a significant effect on the magnitude of the germinal center (GC) response. We further observed reduced dendritic cell and monocyte numbers in the spleens of miR-21 deficient Sle1b (Sle1b.miR-21KO) mice that were associated with reduced interferon, proinflammatory cytokines, and effector CD4+ T cell responses. RNAseq analysis on B cells from Sle1b.miR-21KO mice revealed reduced activation and response to interferon and cytokine and target array analysis revealed modulation of numerous miR-21 target genes in response to TLR7 activation and type I interferon stimulation. Our findings in the B6.Sle1b.Yaa spontaneous model recapitulated the miR-21 role in TLR7-induced responses with an additional role in autoimmune GC and Tfh responses. Finally, immunization with T-dependent antigen revealed a role for miR-21 in foreign antigen driven GC and Ab, but not AFC responses. Our data suggest a potential multifaceted, context-dependent role for miR-21 in autoimmune and foreign antigen driven AFC and GC responses. Further study is warranted to delineate the cell-intrinsic requirements and mechanisms of miR-21 during infection and SLE development.\n\nKey PointsO_LImiR-21 has context dependent effects on AFC and GC responses\nC_LIO_LImiR-21 promotes TLR7-driven autoimmunity with activation of multiple B cell pathways\nC_LIO_LImiR-21 is required for optimal B cell responses to T-dependent foreign antigen\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes are vital organelles vulnerable to injuries from diverse materials. Failure to repair or sequester damaged lysosomes poses a threat to cell viability. Here we report that cells exploit a sphingomyelin-based lysosomal repair pathway that operates independently of ESCRT to reverse potentially lethal membrane damage. Various conditions perturbing organelle integrity trigger a rapid calcium-activated scrambling and cytosolic exposure of sphingomyelin. Subsequent metabolic conversion of sphingomyelin by neutral sphingomyelinases on the cytosolic surface of injured lysosomes promotes their repair, also when ESCRT function is compromised. Conversely, blocking turnover of cytosolic sphingomyelin renders cells more sensitive to lysosome-damaging drugs. Our data indicate that calcium-activated scramblases, sphingomyelin, and neutral sphingomyelinases are core components of a previously unrecognized membrane restoration pathway by which cells preserve the functional integrity of lysosomes.",

    "abstract": "Polyploid cells contain more than two copies of the genome and are found in many plant and animal tissues. Different types of polyploidy exist, in which the genome is confined to either one nucleus (mononucleation) or two or more nuclei (multinucleation). Despite the widespread occurrence of polyploidy, the functional significance of different types of polyploidy are largely unknown. Here, we assess the function of multinucleation in C. elegans intestinal cells through specific inhibition of binucleation without altering genome ploidy. Through single worm RNA sequencing, we find that binucleation is important for tissuespecific gene expression, most prominently for genes that show a rapid upregulation at the transition from larval development to adulthood. Regulated genes include vitellogenins, which encode yolk proteins that facilitate nutrient transport to the germline. We find that reduced expression of vitellogenins in mononucleated intestinal cells leads to progeny with developmental delays and reduced fitness. Together, our results show that binucleation facilitates rapid upregulation of intestine-specific gene expression during development, independently of genome ploidy, underscoring the importance of spatial genome organization for polyploid cell function.",

    "abstract": "Summary ParagraphAlthough germline mutation rates and spectra can vary within and between species, genetic modifiers of these traits have long eluded detection. In this study, we searched for loci that influence germline mutagenesis using a uniquely powerful resource: a panel of recombinant inbred mouse lines known as the BXD, descended from the laboratory mouse strains C57BL/6J (B) and DBA/2J (D). Each BXD lineage has been maintained by brother-sister mating in the near absence of natural selection, accumulating de novo mutations for up to 50 years on a known genetic background that is a unique linear mosaic of B and D haplotypes. We show that mice inheriting D haplotypes at a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 4 accumulate C>A germline mutations at a 50% higher rate than those inheriting B haplotypes, primarily due to the activity of a C>A-dominated mutational signature known as SBS18. The B and D QTL haplotypes encode different alleles of the DNA repair gene Mutyh, which underlies the heritable colorectal cancer syndrome in which SBS18 was first identified. The B and D Mutyh alleles are present in wild populations of Mus musculus domesticus, providing evidence that common genetic variation modulates germline mutagenesis in a model mammalian species.",

Accordingly, obtaining a molecule that targets -synuclein pathogenic assemblies with high affinity and selectivity is a long-pursued objective. Here, we have exploited the biophysical properties of toxic oligomers and amyloid fibrils to identify a family of -helical peptides that bind selectively to these -synuclein species with low nanomolar affinity, without interfering with the monomeric functional protein. This activity is translated into an unprecedented anti-aggregation potency and the ability to abrogate the oligomers toxicity. With a structure-function relationship in hand, we identified a human peptide expressed in the brain and in the gastrointestinal tract with exceptional binding, antiaggregation, and detoxifying properties, which suggests it might play a protective role against synucleinopathies. The chemical entities we describe here represent a new therapeutic paradigm and are promising tools to assist diagnosis by selectively detecting -synuclein pathogenic species in biofluids.",

    "abstract": "Humans and other primates interact with the world by observing and exploring visual objects. In particular, they often seek out the opportunities to view novel objects that they have never seen before, even when they have no extrinsic primary reward value. However, despite the importance of novel visual objects in our daily life, we currently lack an understanding of how primate brain circuits control the motivation to seek out novelty. We found that novelty-seeking is regulated by a small understudied subcortical region, the zona incerta (ZI). In a task in which monkeys made eye movements to familiar objects to obtain the opportunity to view novel objects, many ZI neurons were preferentially activated by predictions of future novel objects and displayed burst excitations before gaze shifts to gain access to novel objects. Low intensity electrical stimulation of ZI facilitated gaze shifts, while inactivations of ZI reduced novelty-seeking. Surprisingly, additional experiments showed that this ZI-dependent novelty seeking behavior is not regulated by canonical neural circuitry for reward seeking. The habenula-dopamine pathway, known to reflect reward predictions that control reward seeking, was relatively inactive during novelty-seeking behavior in which novelty had no extrinsic reward value. Instead, high channel-count electrophysiological experiments and anatomical tracing identified a prominent source of control signals for novelty seeking in the anterior ventral medial temporal cortex (AVMTC), a brain region known to be crucially involved in visual processing and object memory. In addition to their well-known function in signaling the novelty or familiarity of objects in the current environment, AVMTC neurons reflected the predictions of future novel objects, akin to the way neurons in reward-circuitry predict future rewards in order to control reward-seeking. Our data uncover a network of primate brain areas that regulate novelty-seeking. The behavioral and neural distinctions between novelty-seeking and reward-processing highlight how the brain can accomplish behavioral flexibility, providing a mechanism to explore novel objects.",

Few studies have teased apart the independent effects of biotic and abiotic factors on aboveground carbon across tree size groups and the whole tree community level in a tropical semi-deciduous rainforest. This study aims to analyze the relative and independent effects of abiotic (topography, soil fertility/texture and disturbance) and biotic factors on carbon stocks across tree size groups, as well as at the whole tree community in semi-deciduous plots, including logged plots.\n\nWe used data from 30 1-ha plots and 22,064 trees distributed in a semi-deciduous tropical rainforest of Cameroon. For each plot, we quantified disturbance, topography and eleven soil conditions. Besides, we quantified three taxonomic richness and diversity Gini index. We used structural equation models to test the hypothesis that all drivers have independent, positive effects on aboveground carbon stocks across tree-sized groups and the whole tree community.\n\nThe logging disturbance decreased aboveground carbon stocks for the whole tree community and trees size groups across our site except for large trees. Topographical factors (i.e., slope and elevation) increased aboveground carbon (AGC) of the whole tree community and the large trees. In contrast, soil nitrogen (Nsoil) and clay proportion increased AGC of the small stems and understorey trees groups. This study found that biotics factors have some indirect and direct effects on AGC. Taxonomic diversity through niche complementarity had a positive relationship with aboveground carbon stocks across the trees size groups and the whole tree community, while diversity Gini index had strongest relationships with aboveground carbon stocks.\n\nThe significant effects of structural diversity on aboveground carbon stocks of the whole tree community, large trees, and understory trees highlight the importance of maintaining a layered structure and tall trees in the forest.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMany SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have emerged since the Covid-19 outburst, notably the lineages detected in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil. Their increased transmissibility and higher viral load put them in the spotlight. Much has been investigated on the ability of those new variants to evade antibody recognition. However, not enough attention has been given to pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses during the natural course of infection by new lineages.\n\nMethodsIn this work, we investigated the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes from the main variants of concern and the potential of associated mutations to trigger or hinder CD8+ T-cells response. We also estimated the populations coverage of these different lineages, considering peptide binding predictions to class I HLA alleles from 29 countries to investigate differences in the fraction of individuals expected to respond to a given epitope set from new and previous lineages.\n\nResultsWe observed a lower populational coverage for 20B/S.484K (P.2 lineage) in contrast to an increased coverage found for 20H/501Y.V2 (B.1.351 Lineage) and 20J/501Y.V3 (P.1 lineage) compared to a reference lineage. Moreover, mutations such as Spike N501Y and Nucleocapsid T205I were predicted to have an overall higher affinity through HLA-I than the reference sequence.\n\nConclusionsIn summary, the data in this work provided evidence for the existence of potentially immunogenic and conserved epitopes across new SARS-CoV-2 variants, but also highlights the reduced populationals coverage for the Brazilian lineage P.2, suggesting its potential to evade from CD8+ T-cell responses. Our results also may guide efforts to characterize and validate relevant peptides to trigger CD8+ T-cell responses, and design new universal T-cell-inducing vaccine candidates that minimize detrimental effects of viral diversification and at the same time induce responses to a broad human population.",

    "abstract": "What makes our lungs look red? This seems to be a naIve and trivial question. Indeed, all the textbooks tell us that what makes our body red is the presence of blood, or more precisely the red blood cells (RBC). Here we provide some experimental evidence as well arguments to prove that this belief is wrong, or only partially true. In fact, we identified an important population of red cells located outside of the blood vessels as highly compacted clusters, in the connection tissues of the lungs of several species of animals including rat and human being. These red cells possessed each a nucleus, expressing several biomarkers of different cell types such as PF4, vWF, SCF-1R, CD200R, TGF-b, etc... Interestingly, being morphologically heterogeneous, they react collectively to certain stimuli. For example, they aggregated on collagen fibers forming clusters of cells resembling that observed in vivo. The red cells may have some features of Hematopoietic Stem Cells, since they were capable of differentiating into other cell types such as alveolar macrophages. In nasal polyps, these cells formed vessel-like structures, confined within a CD31-positive tubes. Upon exposure to toxic chemicals, they formed dense networks, suggesting a possible role in coagulation. Furthermore, the number of these red cells was greatly increased in the lungs of diseased donors, especially in the lungs of CF patients. Instead of being secreted as what happens in normal red cells, vWF proteins were tethered on the cytoplasmic membrane of the red cells isolated from the lungs of CF donors, which may explain at least partially the fibrotic nature of the CF lungs.\n\nTaken together, we conclude that what makes the lungs look red is not the red blood cells, rather a distinct population of red cells, we call them Red Soma Cells (RSC). We believe that the discovery and characterization of this important population of cells will have profound theoretic as well as therapeutic implications.",

This precise control of gene expression is achieved by complex and interlinked biochemical processes that modulate both the protein synthesis rate and stability of each individual mRNA. A major factor coordinating this regulation is the Ccr4-Not complex. Despite playing a role in most stages of the mRNA life cycle, no attempt has been made to take a global integrated view of how the Ccr4-Not complex affects gene expression.\n\nResultsThis study has taken a comprehensive approach to investigate post-transcriptional regulation mediated by the Ccr4-Not complex assessing steady-state mRNA levels, ribosome position, mRNA stability and protein production transcriptome-wide. Depletion of the scaffold protein CNOT1 results in a global upregulation of mRNA stability and the preferential stabilisation of mRNAs enriched for G/C-ending codons. We also uncover that mRNAs targeted to the ER for their translation have reduced translational efficiency when CNOT1 is depleted, specifically downstream of the signal sequence cleavage site. In contrast, translationally upregulated mRNAs are normally localised in p-bodies, contain disorder-promoting amino acids and encode nuclear localised proteins. Finally, we identify ribosome pause sites that are resolved or induced by the depletion of CNOT1.\n\nConclusionWe define the key mRNA features that determine how the human Ccr4-Not complex differentially regulates mRNA fate and protein synthesis through a mechanism linked to codon composition, amino acid usage, and mRNA localisation.",

    "abstract": "Parasitism is a highly successful life strategy and a driving force in genetic diversity that has evolved many times over. Consequently, parasitic organisms have adopted a rich display of traits associated with survival that guarantees an effective \"communication\" with the host immunity and a balance with surrounding microbiome. However, gain/loss of hosts along the evolutionary axis represents a complex scenario that as contemporary onlookers, we can observe only after a long time displacement. The zoonotic and monophyletic Anisakidae diverged from its terrestrial sister group Ascarididae 150-250 Ma, although a split from their common ancestral host, a terrestrial amniote, seemingly happened already in Early Carboniferous (360.47 Ma). Faced with the sea-level rise during the Permian-Triassic extinction (215 Ma), anisakids acquired a semiaquatic tetrapod host, and as a result of lateral host-switches in Cenozoic, colonised marine mammals, co-evolving with their \"new hosts\". Although contemporary anisakids have lost the ability to propagate in terrestrial hosts, they can survive for a limited time in humans. To scrutinize anisakid versatility to infect evolutionary-distant host, we performed transcriptomic profiling of larvae infecting the accidental host (rat) and compared it to that of larvae infecting an evolutionary-familiar, paratenic host (fish). Identified differences and the modeling of handful of shared transcripts, provides the first insights into evolution of larval nematode virulence, warranting further investigation of shared transcript as potential drug therapy targets. Our findings have also revealed some key intrinsic cues that direct larval fate during infection.",

    "abstract": "Voices are arguably among the most relevant sounds in humans everyday life, and several studies have suggested the existence of voice-selective regions in the human brain. Despite two decades of research, defining the human brain regions supporting voice recognition remains challenging. Moreover, whether neural selectivity to voices is merely driven by acoustic properties specific to human voices (e.g. spectrogram, harmonicity), or whether it also reflects a higher-level categorization response is still under debate. Here, we objectively measured rapid automatic categorization responses to human voices with Fast Periodic Auditory Stimulation (FPAS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG). Participants were tested with stimulation sequences containing heterogeneous non-vocal sounds from different categories presented at 4 Hz (i.e., 4 stimuli/second), with vocal sounds appearing every 3 stimuli (1.333 Hz). A few minutes of stimulation are sufficient to elicit robust 1.333 Hz voice-selective focal brain responses over superior temporal regions of individual participants. This response is virtually absent for sequences using frequency-scrambled sounds, but is clearly observed when voices are presented among sounds from musical instruments matched for pitch and harmonicity-to-noise ratio. Overall, our FPAS paradigm demonstrates that the human brain seamlessly categorizes human voices when compared to other sounds including matched musical instruments and that voice-selective responses are at least partially independent from low-level acoustic features, making it a powerful and versatile tool to understand human auditory categorization in general.\n\nSignificance statementVoices are arguably among the most relevant sounds we hear in our everyday life, and several studies have corroborated the existence of regions in the human brain that respond preferentially to voices. However, whether this preference is driven by specific acoustic properties of voices or if it rather reflects a higher-level categorization response to voices is still under debate. We propose a new approach to objectively identify rapid automatic voice-selective responses with frequency tagging and electroencephalographic recordings. In four minutes of recording only, we recorded robust voice-selective responses independent from low-level acoustic cues, making this approach highly promising for studying auditory perception in children and clinical populations.",

    "abstract": "Fleas are major vectors of Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague. It has been proposed that Y. pestis has developed the ability to overcome the innate immune responses of fleas. Despite the fact that they transmit a number of bacterial infections, very little is known about the immune responses in fleas. In this study, we describe the antimicrobial activities of cecropin from Xenopsylla cheopis (cheopin), a major vector for Y. pestis in the wild. This is the first cecropin-class antimicrobial peptide described from Siphonaptera insects. Cheopin showed potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria, but little activity against wild-type Y. pestis KIM6+. Deletion of the aminoarabinose operon, which is responsible for the 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (Ara4N) modification of LPS, rendered Y. pestis highly susceptible to cheopin. Confocal microscopy and whole cell binding assays indicated that Ara4N modification reduces the affinity of cheopin for Y. pestis. Further, cheopin only permeabilized bacterial membranes in the absence of Ara4N-modified LPS, which was correlated with bacterial killing. This study provides insights into innate immunity of the flea and evidence for the crucial role of Ara4N modification of Y. pestis LPS in conferring resistance against flea antimicrobial peptides.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial bloodstream infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Although previous research has demonstrated that pathogenic organisms may translocate from the gut microbiome into the bloodstream to cause infections, the mechanisms by which HCT patients acquire pathogens in their microbiome have not yet been described. We hypothesized that patient-patient transmission may be responsible for pathogens colonizing the microbiome of HCT patients, and that patients who share time and space in the hospital are more likely to share bacterial strains.\n\nHere, we used linked-read and short-read metagenomic sequencing to analyze 401 stool samples collected from 149 adults undergoing HCT and hospitalized in the same unit over five years. We used metagenomic assembly and strain-specific comparison methods to investigate transmission of gut microbiota between individuals. While patients who shared time and space in the hospital did not converge in overall microbiome composition, we did observe four pairs of patients who harbor identical or nearly identical E. faecium strains in their microbiome. These strains may be the result of transmission between patients who shared a room and bathroom, acquisition from a common source in the hospital or transmission from an unsampled source.\n\nWe also observed identical Akkermansia muciniphila and Hungatella hathewayi strains in two pairs of patients. In both cases, the patients were roommates for at least one day, the strain was absent in the putative recipients microbiome prior to the period of roommate overlap and the putative recipient had a microbiome perturbed by antibiotic treatment for a bloodstream infection. Finally, we identified multiple patients who harbored identical strains of several species commonly found in commercial probiotics and dairy products, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus gasseri and Streptococcus thermophilus. Overall, our findings indicate that pathogenic organisms from a single source are not frequently colonizing the gut microbiome of multiple patients. However, the potential transmission of commensal microbes with immunomodulatory properties raises questions about the recovery of microbiome diversity after HCT, and indicates that patients in this setting may acquire new microbes by sharing space with others.",

    "abstract": "Space type radiation is an important factor to consider for scientists on International Space Stations, especially high linear transfer energy (LET) since it has imminent effects on microorganisms. The abundances of bacteria are a good indicator of how radiation influences the gut microbiome. The current study is an attempt towards this; thus, we have employed a public dataset (Bioproject code PRJNA368790) of 80 mice samples treated with a range of doses from 0Gy to 1Gy and feces samples were collected at different time points of post radiation treatment. Metagenomic analysis was performed on this data to understand the effect of radiation doses on the abundance of microbial species or microbial diversity implementing the DADA2 and Phyloseq pipelines. Our analyses have shown that 0.1Gy high LET radiation had the significant effect on the species of bacteria. There is a significant decrease in four types of bacteria, i.e., Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium castoris, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii, with p-value of 7.05x10-5, 0.020, 0.057and 0.020, respectively. Additionally, pathway analysis indicates the protein coding products of these bacteria are involved in the GABAergic synaptic pathway. Further, our study has shown the significant difference between post radiation time points, i.e., 10 days vs.30 days and suggested the acclimatization period could be around 10 days for these bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to occur through a number of routes, including contact with contaminated surfaces. Many studies have used RT-PCR analysis to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces but seldom has viable virus been detected. This paper investigates the viability over time of SARS-CoV-2 dried onto a range of materials and compares viability of the virus to RNA copies recovered, and whether virus viability is concentration dependant.\n\nViable virus persisted for the longest time on surgical mask material and stainless steel with a 99.9% reduction in viability by 124 and 113 hours respectively. Viability of SARS-CoV-2 reduced the fastest on a polyester shirt, with a 99.9% reduction within 2.5 hours. Viability on cotton was reduced second fastest, with 99.9% reduction in 72 hours. RNA on all the surfaces exhibited a one log reduction in genome copy recovery over 21 days.\n\nThe findings show that SARS-CoV-2 is most stable on non-porous hydrophobic surfaces. RNA is highly stable when dried on surfaces with only one log reduction in recovery over three weeks. In comparison, SARS-CoV-2 viability reduced more rapidly, but this loss in viability was found to be independent of starting concentration. Expected levels of SARS-CoV-2 viable environmental surface contamination would lead to undetectable levels within two days. Therefore, when RNA is detected on surfaces it does not directly indicate presence of viable virus even at high CT values.\n\nImportanceThis study shows the impact of material type on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. It demonstrates that the decay rate of viable SARS-CoV-2 is independent of starting concentration. However, RNA shows high stability on surfaces over extended periods. This has implications for interpretation of surface sampling results using RT-PCR to determine the possibility of viable virus from a surface. Unless sampled immediately after contamination it is difficult to align RNA copy numbers to quantity of viable virus on a surface.",

We have predicted the structure of human monoubiquitinated FANCD2 by using our method and studied the interaction with DNA by docking studies.

Here, we aimed to further investigate oscillatory brain mechanisms supporting the executive components of WM - the part responsible for the manipulation of information. We conducted an exploratory reanalysis of a previously published EEG dataset where 156 participants (82 females) performed tasks requiring either simple retention or retention and manipulation of verbal information in WM. A relatively long delay period (>6s) was employed to investigate the temporal trajectory of the oscillatory brain activity. Compared to baseline, theta activity was significantly enhanced during encoding and the delay period. Alpha-band power decreased during encoding and switched to an increase in the first part of the delay before returning to the baseline in the second part; beta-band power remained below baseline during encoding and the delay. The difference between the manipulation and retention tasks in spectral power had diverse temporal trajectories in different frequency bands. The difference maintained over encoding and the first part of the delay in theta, during the first part of the delay in beta, and during the whole delay period in alpha. Our results suggest that task-related modulations in theta power co-vary with the demands on the executive control network; beta suppression during mental manipulation can be related to the activation of motor networks; alpha is likely to reflect the activation of language areas simultaneously with sensory input blockade.",

    "abstract": "The potential for megafauna restoration is unevenly distributed across the world, along with the socio-political capacity of countries to support these restoration initiatives. We show that choosing a recent baseline to identify species indigenous range puts a higher burden for megafauna restoration on countries in the Global South, which also have less capacity to support these restoration initiatives. We introduce the Megafauna Index, which considers large mammals potential species richness and range area at country-level, to explore how the responsibility for megafauna restoration distributes across the world according to four scenarios using various temporal benchmarks to define species indigenous range - current, historical (1500AD), mid-Holocene and Pleistocene. We test how the distribution of restoration burden across the world correlates to indicators of conservation funding, human development, and governance. Using a recent or historical baseline as a benchmark for restoration puts a higher pressure on African and southeast Asian countries while lifting the responsibility from the Global North, where extinctions happened a long time ago. When using a mid-Holocene or Pleistocene baseline, new opportunities arise for megafauna restoration in Europe and North America respectively, where countries have a higher financial and societal capacity to support megafauna restoration. These results contribute to the debate around benchmarks in rewilding initiatives and the ethical implications of using recent baselines to guide restoration efforts. We suggest that countries from the Global North should reflect on their responsibility in supporting global restoration efforts, by increasing their support for capacity building in the South and taking responsibility for restoring lost biodiversity at home.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe traditional mechanistic trade-offs resulting in a negative correlation between transmission and virulence are the foundation of nearly all current theory on the evolution of parasite virulence. Several ecological factors have been shown to modulate the optimal virulence strategies predicted from mechanistic trade-off models, but these ecological factors have not yet been shown to be sufficient to explain the intermediate virulence strategies observed in any natural system. The timing of seasonal activity, or phenology, is a common factor that influences the types and impact of many ecological interactions but is difficult to incorporate into virulence evolution studies. We develop a mathematical model of a disease system with seasonal host activity to study the evolutionary consequences of host phenology on the virulence of obligate-killer parasite. Results from this model demonstrated that seasonal host activity is sufficient to drive the evolution of intermediate parasite virulence in some types of natural disease systems, even when a traditional mechanistic trade-off between transmission and virulence is not assumed in the modeling framework. The optimal virulence strategy in these systems can be determined by both the duration of the host activity period as well as the variation in the host emergence timing. Parasites with low virulence strategies are favored in environments with long host activity periods and in environments in which hosts emerge synchronously. The results demonstrate that host phenology can be sufficient to select for intermediate optimal virulence strategies, providing an alternative mechanism to account for virulence evolution in some natural systems.",

    "abstract": "MotivationLong non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) are a class of RNA molecules with more than 200 nucleotides. A growing amount of evidence reveals that subcellular localization of lncRNAs can provide valuable insights into their biological functions. Existing computational methods for predicting lncRNA subcellular localization use k-mer features to encode lncRNA sequences. However, the sequence order information is lost by using only k-mer features.\n\nResultsWe proposed a deep learning framework, DeepLncLoc, to predict lncRNA subcellular localization. In DeepLncLoc, we introduced a new subsequence embedding method that keeps the order information of lncRNA sequences. The subsequence embedding method first divides a sequence into some consecutive subsequences, and then extracts the patterns of each subsequence, last combines these patterns to obtain a complete representation of the lncRNA sequence. After that, a text convolutional neural network is employed to learn high-level features and perform the prediction task. Compared to traditional machine learning models with k-mer features and existing predictors, DeepLncLoc achieved better performance, which shows that DeepLncLoc could effectively predict lncRNA subcellular localization. Our study not only presented a novel computational model for predicting lncRNA subcellular localization but also provided a new subsequence embedding method which is expected to be applied in other sequence-based prediction tasks.\n\nAvailabilityThe DeepLncLoc web server, source code and datasets are freely available at http://bioinformatics.csu.edu.cn/DeepLncLoc/, and https://github.com/CSUBioGroup/DeepLncLoc.\n\nContactlimin@mail.csu.edu.cn",

However, classical in vitro patterning experiments explore only one mechanism at a time, thus missing coupling effects. Here, we conjugate two major pattern-forming mechanisms --reaction-diffusion and active matter-- by integrating dissipative DNA/enzyme reaction networks within an active gel composed of cytoskeletal motors and filaments. We show that the strength of the flow generated by the active gel controls the mechano-chemical coupling between the two subsystems. This property was used to engineer a synthetic material where contractions trigger chemical reaction networks both in time and space, thus mimicking key aspects of the polarization mechanism observed in C. elegans oocytes. We anticipate that reaction-diffusion active matter will promote the investigation of mechano-chemical transduction and the design of new materials with life-like properties.",

    "abstract": "Graphical AbstractIn this article we describe two predictive models that can be used for the integrated management of wheat bulb fly. Our first model is a pest level prediction model and our second model predicts the number of shoots a winter wheat crop will achieve by the terminal spikelet developmental stage. We revise and update current wheat bulb fly damage thresholds and combine this with our two models to devise a tolerance-based decision support system that can be used to minimise the risk of crop damage by wheat bulb fly.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=152 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/435242v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ee5b9aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c0197corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c9519eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d6a52_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG SummaryWheat bulb fly, Delia coarctata, is an important pest of winter wheat in the UK, causing significant damage of up to 4 t ha-1. Accepted population thresholds for D. coarctata are 250 eggs m-2 for crops sown up to the end of October and 100 eggs m-2 for crops sown from November. Fields with populations of D. coarctata that exceed the thresholds are at higher risk of experiencing economically damaging pest infestations. In the UK, recent withdrawal of insecticides means that only a seed treatment is available for chemical control of D. coarctata, however this is only effective for late-sown crops (November onwards) and accurate estimations of annual population levels are required to ensure a seed treatment is applied if needed. As a result of the lack of post-drilling control strategies, the management of D. coarctata is becoming increasingly reliant on non-chemical methods of control. Control strategies that are effective in managing similar stem-boring pests of wheat include sowing earlier and using higher seed rates to produce crops with more shoots and greater tolerance to shoot damage.\n\nIn this study we develop two predictive models that can be used for integrated D. coarctata management. The first is an updated pest level prediction model that predicts D. coarctata populations from meteorological parameters with a predictive accuracy of 70%, which represents a significant improvement on the previous D. coarctata population prediction model. Our second model predicts the maximum number of shoots for a winter wheat crop that would be expected at the terminal spikelet development stage. This shoot number model uses information about the thermal time from plant emergence to terminal spikelet, leaf phyllochron length, plant population, and sowing date to predict the degree of tolerance a crop will have against D. coarctata. The shoot number model was calibrated against data collected from five field experiments and tested against data from four experiments. Model testing demonstrated that the shoot number model has a predictive accuracy of 70%. A decision support system using these two models for the sustainable management of D. coarcata risk is described.",

    "abstract": "Symmetry is a highly salient feature of the natural world that is perceived by many species of the animal kingdom and that impacts a large array of behaviours such as partner selection or food choice. In humans, the cerebral areas processing symmetry are now well identified from neuroimaging measurements. However, we currently lack an animal model to explore the underlying neural mechanisms. Macaque is a potentially good candidate, but a previous comparative study (1) found that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to mirror symmetry in this species were substantially weaker than those observed in humans under similar experimental conditions. Here, we re-examined symmetry processing in macaques from a broader perspective, using both rotation (experiment 1) and reflection (experiment 2) symmetry. Our experimental design was directly derived from that of a previous human fMRI study (2), in order to facilitate the comparison between the two primate species. Highly consistent responses to symmetry were found in a large network of areas (notably V3, V3A, V4, V4A and PITd), in line with what has been observed in humans. Within this network, response properties in areas V3 and V4 (notably their dependency on the rotation symmetry order) were strikingly similar to those observed in their human counterparts. Our results suggest that the cortical networks that process symmetry in humans and macaques are much more similar than previously reported and point toward macaque as a relevant model for understanding symmetry processing.\n\nSignificance statementSymmetry processing is an important aspect of human visual perception. We currently lack an animal model for characterizing the neural mechanisms that underlie it at the microscopic scale. Here, we use fMRI measurements in macaques to demonstrate that the cortical responses to symmetry in this species are comparable to those observed in humans under similar experimental conditions to a much higher extent than previously documented. Our results call for a re-examination of the relevance of the macaque model for symmetry processing in humans and open the door to an exploration of the underlying neural mechanisms at the single-cell level, notably in V3, an area often neglected in most current models of visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play diverse roles in different biological and physiological environments and are always expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Tissue-specific circRNA expression profile can help understand how circRNAs are regulated. Here, using large-scale neuron isolation from the first larval stage of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) followed by whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing, I provide the first neuronal circRNA data in C. elegans. I show that circRNAs are highly expressed in the neurons of C. elegans and are preferably derived from neuronal genes. More importantly, reverse complementary matches in circRNA-flanking introns are not only required for back-splicing but also promote the skipping of exon(s) to be circularized. Interestingly, one pair of RCM in zip-2 is highly conserved across five nematode ortholog genes, which show conserved exon-skipping patterns. Finally, through one-by-one mutagenesis of all the splicing sites and branch points required for exon-skipping and back-splicing in the zip-2 gene, I show that exon-skipping is not absolutely required for back-splicing, neither the other way. Instead, the coupled exon-skipping and back-splicing are happening at the same time.",

    "abstract": "Nepenthes pitcher plants live in nutrient-poor soils and produce large pitfall traps to obtain additional nutrients from animal prey. Previous research has shown that the digestive secretion in N. rafflesiana is a sticky viscoelastic fluid that is much more effective at retaining insects than water, even after significant dilution. Although the physical properties of the fluid are important for its retentive function, it is unclear how the fluid interacts with insect cuticle and how its sticky nature affects struggling insects. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms behind the efficient prey retention in N. rafflesiana pitcher fluid. By measuring the attractive forces exerted on insect body parts moving in and out of test fluids, we show that it costs insects significantly more energy to separate from pitcher fluid than from water. Moreover, both the maximum force and the energy required for retraction increase after the first contact with the pitcher fluid. We found that insects sink more easily into pitcher fluid than water and, accordingly, the surface tension of N. rafflesiana pitcher fluid was significantly lower than that of water (60.2 vs. 72.3 mN/m). By analysing the pitcher fluid dewetting behaviour, we demonstrate that it strongly resists dewetting from all surfaces tested, leaving behind residual films and filaments that can facilitate re-wetting. This inhibition of dewetting may be a further consequence of the fluids viscoelastic nature and likely represents a key mechanism underlying prey retention in Nepenthes pitcher plants.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Brazil was dominated by two lineages designated as B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33. Two SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring mutations at the receptor-binding domain of the Spike (S) protein, designated as lineages P.1 and P.2, evolved within lineage B.1.1.28 and are rapidly spreading in Brazil. Lineage P.1 is considered a Variant of Concern (VOC) because of the presence of multiple mutations in the S protein (including K417T, E484K, N501Y), while lineage P.2 only harbors mutation S:E484K and is considered a Variant of Interest (VOI). Here we report the identification of a new SARS-CoV-2 VOI within lineage B.1.1.33 that also harbors mutation S:E484K and was detected in Brazil between November 2020 and February 2021. This VOI displayed four non-synonymous lineage-defining mutations (NSP3:A1711V, NSP6:F36L, S:E484K, and NS7b:E33A) and was designated as lineage N.9. The VOI N.9 probably emerged in August 2020 and has spread across different Brazilian states from the Southeast, South, North and Northeast regions.",
