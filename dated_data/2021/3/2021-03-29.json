    "abstract": "In selective autophagy of the nucleus (hereafter nucleophagy), nucleus-derived double membrane vesicles (NDVs) are formed, sequestered within autophagosomes, and delivered to lysosomes or vacuoles for degradation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the nuclear envelope (NE) protein Atg39 acts as a nucleophagy receptor, which interacts with Atg8 to target NDVs to forming autophagosomal membranes. In this study, we revealed that Atg39 is anchored to the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) via its transmembrane domain and also associated with the inner nuclear membrane (INM) via membrane-binding amphipathic helices (APHs) in its perinuclear space region, thereby linking these membranes. We also revealed that overaccumulation of Atg39 causes the NE to protrude towards the cytoplasm, and the tips of the protrusions are pinched off to generate NDVs. The APHs of Atg39 are crucial for Atg39 assembly in the NE and subsequent NE protrusion. These findings suggest that the nucleophagy receptor Atg39 plays pivotal roles in NE deformation during the generation of NDVs to be degraded by nucleophagy.",

    "abstract": "The neuronal axon contains many intracellular compartments which travel between the cell body and axon tip. The nature of these cargos and the complex axonal environment through which they traverse is unclear. Here, we describe the internal components of mammalian sensory axons using cryo-electron tomography. We show that axonal endoplasmic reticulum has thin, beaded appearance and is tethered to microtubules at multiple sites. The tethers are elongated, [~] 7 nm long proteins which cluster in small groups. We survey the different membrane-bound cargos in axons, quantify their abundance and describe novel internal features including granules and broken membranes. We observe connecting density between membranes and microtubules which may correspond to motor proteins. In addition to membrane-bound organelles, we detect numerous proteinaceous compartments, including vaults and previously undescribed virus-like capsid particles. The abundance of these compartments suggests they undergo trafficking in axons. Our observations outline the physical characteristics of axonal cargo and provide a platform for identification of their constituents.",

    "abstract": "Platelet derived growth factor beta and its receptor, Pdgfrb, play essential roles in the development of vascular mural cells, including pericytes and vascular smooth muscle. To determine if this role was conserved in zebrafish, we analyzed pdgfb and pdgfrb mutant lines. Similar to mouse, pdgfb and pdgfrb mutant zebrafish lack brain pericytes and exhibit anatomically selective loss of vascular smooth muscle coverage. Despite these defects, pdgfrb mutant zebrafish did not otherwise exhibit circulatory defects at larval stages. However, beginning at juvenile stages, we observed severe cranial hemorrhage and vessel dilation associated with loss of pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells in pdgfrb mutants. Similar to mouse, pdgfrb mutant zebrafish also displayed structural defects in the glomerulus, but normal development of hepatic stellate cells. We also noted defective mural cell investment on coronary vessels with concomitant defects in their development. Together, our studies support a conserved requirement for Pdgfrb signaling in mural cells. In addition, these mutants provide an important model for definitive investigation of mural cells during early embryonic stages without confounding secondary effects from circulatory defects.\n\nSummary statementGenetic analysis in zebrafish demonstrates the conserved role of Pdgfb/Pdgfrb signaling in pericyte and vascular smooth muscle cell formation during vascular development in vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Embryos that carry zygotic or parental mutations in Ehmt2, the gene encoding the main euchromatic histone H3K9 methyltransferase, EHMT2, exhibit variable developmental delay. We asked the question whether the delayed embryo is different transcriptionally from the normally developing embryo when they reach the same developmental stage. We collected embryos carrying a series of genetic deficiencies in the Ehmt2 gene and performed total RNA sequencing of somite stage-matched individual embryos. We applied novel four-way comparisons to detect differences between normal versus deficient embryos, and between 12-somite and 6-somite embryos. Importantly, we also identified developmental changes in transcription that only occur during the development of the normal embryo. We found that at the 6-somite stage, gastrulation-specific genes were not precisely turned off in the Ehmt2-/- embryos, and genes involved in organ growth, connective tissue development, striated muscle development, muscle differentiation, and cartilage development were not precisely switched on in the Ehmt2-/- embryos. Zygotic EHMT2 reduced transcriptional variation of developmental switch genes and at some repeat elements at the six-somite stage embryos. Maternal EHMT2-mutant embryos also displayed great transcriptional variation consistent with their variable survival, but transcription was normal in developmentally delayed parental haploinsufficient embryos, consistent with their good prospects. Global profiling of transposable elements in the embryo revealed that specific repeat classes responded to EHMT2. DNA methylation was specifically targeted by EHMT2 to LTR repeats, mostly ERVKs. Long noncoding transcripts initiated from those misregulated  driver repeats in Ehmt2-/- embryos, and extended to several hundred kilobases, encompassing a multitude of additional, similarly misexpressed  passenger repeats. These findings establish EHMT2 as an important regulator of the transition between gastrulation programs and organ specification programs and of variability.",
