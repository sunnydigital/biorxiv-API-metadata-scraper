    "abstract": "Terrestrial animals such as ants, mice and dogs often use surface-bound scent trails to establish navigation routes or to find food and mates, yet their tracking strategies are poorly understood. Tracking behavior features zig-zagging paths with animals often staying in close contact with the trail. Upon sustained loss of contact, animals execute a characteristic sequence of sweeping \"casts\" - wide oscillations with increasing amplitude. Here, we provide a unified description of trail-tracking behavior by introducing an optimization framework where animals search in the angular sector defined by their estimate of the trails heading and its uncertainty. In silico experiments using reinforcement learning based on this hypothesis recapitulate experimentally observed tracking patterns. We show that search geometry imposes limits on the tracking speed, and quantify its dependence on trail statistics and memory of past contacts. By formulating trail-tracking as a Bellman-type sequential optimization problem, we quantify the basic geometric elements of optimal sector search strategy, effectively explaining why and when casting is necessary. We propose a set of experiments to infer how tracking animals acquire, integrate and respond to past information on the tracked trail. More generally, we define navigational strategies relevant for animals and bio-mimetic robots, and formulate trail-tracking as a novel behavioral paradigm for learning, memory and planning.",

    "abstract": "The increasing number of single cell and bulk RNAseq data sets describing complex gene expression profiles in different organisms, organs or cell types calls for an intuitive tool allowing rapid comparative analysis. Here we present Swift Profiling Of Transcriptomes (SPOT) as a web tool that allows not only differential expression analysis but also fast ranking of genes fitting transcription profiles of interest. Based on a heuristic approach the spot algorithm ranks the genes according to their proximity to the user-defined gene expression profile of interest. The best hits are visualized as a table, bar chart or dot plot and can be exported as an Excel file. While the tool is generally applicable, we tested it on RNAseq data from malaria parasites that undergo multiple stage transformations during their complex life cycle as well as on data from multiple human organs during development and cell lines infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. SPOT should enable non-bioinformaticians to easily analyse their own and any available dataset.",

    "abstract": "Vicarious trial and error behaviors (VTEs) indicate periods of indecision during decision-making, and have been proposed as a behavioral marker of deliberation. In order to understand the neural underpinnings of these putative bridges between behavior and neural dynamics, researchers need the ability to readily distinguish VTEs from non-VTEs. Here we utilize a small set of trajectory-based features and standard machine learning classifiers to identify VTEs from non-VTEs for rats performing a spatial delayed alternation task (SDA) on an elevated plus maze. We also show that previously reported features of the hippocampal field potential oscillation can be used in the same types of classifiers to separate VTEs from non-VTEs with above chance performance. However, we caution that the modest classifier success using hippocampal population dynamics is not sufficient for identifying trials where VTEs occur, and show that combining oscillation-based features with trajectory-based features degrades classifier performance compared to trajectory-based features alone. Overall, we propose a standard set of features useful for trajectory-based VTE classification and support previous suggestions that VTEs are supported by a network including, but likely extending beyond, the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Purification of proteins from human plasma is a herculean task to perform 2-D gel electrophoresis. Human plasma contains nearly 70% albumin and globulin. The removal of such high abundance high molecular weight proteins is very difficult before performing 2-D gel electrophoresis. It becomes more difficult when we intent to investigate in infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS. We tried to the best of our efforts adopting various organic and non-organic based protocols based on various published papers. After failure of these protocols in results of 2-D gel-electrophoresis Aurum serum mini kit (Bio-Rad, USA) was adopted for plasma protein purification for performing 2-D gel electrophoresis. The low-abundance proteins were better resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE in 2-D gel-electrophoresis. Then,we extended the MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis of low-abundance proteins in human plasma by adopting the Aurum serum mini kit (Bio-Rad, USA) for 2-D gel electrophoresis. Thus, we concluded that, depletion of high abundant proteins like albumin and globulin, the use of the Aurum serum mini kit (Bio-Rad, USA) is the protocol of choice to perform the 2-D gel electrophoresis of HIV-1 infected human plasma.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative tumor recurrence is one of the major concerns associated with the poor prognosis of HCC patients. There is yet to elucidate a standard surveillance system for HCC recurrence risk owing to complexity of this malignancy. Generation of multi-omics data from patients facilitate the identification of robust signatures for various diseases. Thus, the current study is an attempt to develop the prognostic models employing multi-omics data to significantly (p-value <0.05) stratify the recurrence high-risk (median Recurrence Free Survival time (RFS) =<12 months) and low-risk groups (median RFS >12 months). First, we identified key 90RNA, 50miRNA and 50 methylation features and developed prognostic models; attained reasonable performance (C-Index >0.70, HR >2.5), on training and validation datasets. Subsequently, we developed a prognostic (PI) model by integrating the four multi-omics features (SUZ12, hsa-mir-3936, cg18465072, and cg22852503), that are biologically inter-linked with each other. This model achieved reasonable performance on training and validation dataset, i.e. C-Index 0.72, HR of 2.37 (1.61 - 3.50), p-value of 6.72E-06, Brier score 0.19 on training dataset, and C-Index 0.72 (95% CI: 0.63 - 0.80), HR of 2.37 (95% CI: 1.61 - 3.50), p-value of 0.015, Brier score 0.19 on validation dataset. Eventually, Drugbank data was investigated to elucidate therapeutic potential of these signatures. We have identified nine potential drugs against three genes (CA9, IL1A, KCNJ15) that are positively correlated with the tumor recurrence. We anticipate these results from our study will help researchers and clinicians to improve the HCC recurrence surveillance, eventually outcome of patients.",

    "abstract": "The search for new biomarkers and drug targets for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has spurred an interest in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), often proposed as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Furthermore, lncRNA expression patterns can bring insights into the global de-regulation of cellular machineries in tumors. Here, we examine lncRNAs in a large HCC cohort, comprising RNA-seq data from paired tumor and adjacent tissue biopsies from 114 patients. We find that numerous lncRNAs are differentially expressed between tumors and adjacent tissues and between tumor progression stages. Although we find strong differential expression for most lncRNAs previously associated with HCC, the expression patterns of several prominent HCC-associated lncRNAs disagree with their previously proposed roles. We examine the genomic characteristics of HCC-expressed lncRNAs and reveal an enrichment for repetitive elements among the lncRNAs with the strongest expression increases in advanced-stage tumors. This enrichment is particularly striking for lncRNAs that overlap with satellite repeats, a major component of centromeres. Consistently, we find increased non-coding RNA transcription from centromeres in tumors, in the majority of patients, suggesting that aberrant centromere activation takes place in HCC.",

    "abstract": "Clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that ubiquitously inhabits a wide variety of natural environments including the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. C. perfringens is an opportunistic enteropathogen capable of producing at least 20 different toxins in various combinations. Strains of C. perfringens are currently categorized into seven toxinotypes (A, B, C, D, E, F & G) based on the presence/absence of four major toxins (alpha, beta, epsilon & iota) and two minor toxins (enterotoxin & netB). Each toxinotype is associated with specific histotoxic and enteric diseases. The Quality Assurance Laboratory (QAL) at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) screens incoming animal feeds for aerobic, enteric pathogens, such as Salmonella spp. and E. coli. Recently, QAL has incorporated anaerobic screening of incoming animal feeds. To date, the lab has isolated numerous Clostridium species, including C. perfringens, from 23 lots of natural-ingredient laboratory animal diets.\n\nImportancePublished reports of Clostridium perfringens isolation from laboratory animal feeds could not be found in the literature. Therefore, we performed a toxin profile screening of our isolated strains of C. perfringens to determine which toxinotypes were present in our laboratory animal diets. As studies progress with immunocompromised strains, gnotobiotic models, and animals with perturbed gut flora, the presence of C. perfringens could potentially lead to infection, disease and mortality which would substantiate the need to properly eliminate the bacterium and its spores from diets given to high risk animal populations.",

    "abstract": "Paramyxoviruses, negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, pose a potential threat to public health. Currently, 78 species and 17 genera of paramyxoviruses are classified and harbored by multiple natural reservoirs, including rodents, bats, birds, reptiles, and fish. Jeilongvirus has been proposed as a novel paramyxovirus genus containing J-, Beilong, and Tailam viruses, found in wild rodents. Using RT-PCR, 824 Apodemus agrarius individuals were examined for the prevalence of paramyxovirus infections. Paramyxovirus RNA was detected in 108 (13.1%) rodents captured at 14 trapping sites in Korea. We first present two genetically distinct novel paramyxoviruses (genus Jeilongvirus), Paju Apodemus paramyxoviruses 1 (PAPV-1) and 2 (PAPV-2), from A. agrarius. Six PAPV strains were completely sequenced using next-generation and Sanger sequencing. PAPV-1 genome comprised 19,716 nucleotides, with eight genes (3'-N-P/V/C-M-F-SH-TM-G-L-5'), whereas PAPV-2 genome contained 17,475 nucleotides, with seven genes (3'-N-P/V/C-M-F-TM-G-L-5'). The disparity between PAPV-1 and -2 revealed the presence of the SH gene and length of the G gene in the genome organization. The phylogenies of PAPV-1 and -2 belong to distinct genetic lineages of Jeilongvirus despite being from the same natural host. PAPV-1 clustered with Beilong and Tailam viruses, while PAPV-2 formed a genetic lineage with Mount Mabu Lophuromys virus-1. PAPV-1 infected human epithelial and endothelial cells, facilitating the induction of type I/III interferons, interferon-stimulated genes, and proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, this study provides profound insights into the molecular epidemiology, virus-host interactions, and zoonotic potential of novel rodent-borne paramyxoviruses.\n\nImportanceParamyxoviruses are a critical public health and socio-economic burden to humans. Rodents play a crucial role in transmitting pathogens to humans. In the last decade, novel paramyxoviruses have been discovered in different rodents. Here, we found that Apodemus agrarius harbored two distinct genotypes of the novel paramyxoviruses, Paju Apodemus paramyxovirues 1 (PAPV-1) and 2 (PAPV-2), possessing unique genome structures that are responsible for encoding TM and G proteins of different sizes. In addition, PAPV-1 infected human epithelial and endothelial cells, facilitating the induction of type I/III IFNs, ISGs, and proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, this study provides significant insights into molecular prevalence, virus-host interactions of paramyxoviruses. These observations raise the awareness of physicians and scientists about the emergence of new rodent-borne paramyxoviruses.",

    "abstract": "Rift Valley fever (RVF) has been linked with recurrent outbreaks among humans and livestock in several parts of the globe. Predicting RVFs habitat suitability under different climate scenarios offers vital information for developing informed management schemes. The present study evaluated the probable impacts of climate change on the distribution of RVF disease in East Africa (E. A.), using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model and the disease outbreak cases. Considering the potential of the spread of the disease in the East Africa region, we utilized two representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) climate scenarios in the 2050s and 2070s (average for 2041-2060, and 2061-2080), respectively. All models had satisfactory AUC values of more than 0.809, which are considered excellent. Jackknife tests revealed that Bio4 (temperature seasonality), land use, and population density were the main factors influencing RVF distribution in the region. From the risk maps generated, we infer that, without regulations, this disease might establish itself across more extensive areas in the region, including most of Rwanda and Burundi. The ongoing trade between East African countries and changing climates could intensify RVF spread into new geographic extents with suitable habitats for the important zoonosis. The predicted suitable areas for RVF in eastern Kenya, southern Tanzania, and Somalia overlaps to a large extent where cattle keeping and pastoralism are highly practiced, thereby signifying the urgency to manage and control the disease. This work validates RVF outbreak cases effectiveness to map the diseases distribution, thus contributing to enhanced ecological modeling and improved disease tracking and control efforts in East Africa.",

    "abstract": "While the investigation of the epigenome becomes increasingly important, still little is known about the long-term evolution of epigenetic marks and systematic investigation strategies are still withstanding. Here, we systematically demonstrate the transfer of classic phylogenetic methods such as maximum likelihood based on substitution models, parsimony, and distance-based to interval-scaled epigenetic data (available at Github). Using a great apes blood data set, we demonstrate that DNA methylation is evolutionarily conserved at the level of individual CpGs in promotors, enhancers and genic regions. Our analysis also reveals that this epigenomic conservation is significantly correlated with its transcription factor binding density. Binding sites for transcription factors involved in neuron differentiation and components of AP-1 evolve at a significantly higher rate at methylation than at nucleotide level. Moreover, our models suggest an accelerated epigenomic evolution at binding sites of BRCA1, CBX2, and factors of the polycomb repressor 2 complex in humans. For most genomic regions, the methylation-based reconstruction of phylogenetic trees is at par with sequence-based reconstruction. Most strikingly, phylogenetic reconstruction using methylation rates in enhancer regions was ineffective independently of the chosen model. We identify a set of phylogenetically uninformative CpG sites enriching in enhancers controlling immune-related genes.",

    "abstract": "Neuropeptides are diverse signalling molecules in animals commonly acting through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Neuropeptides and their receptors underwent extensive diversification in bilaterians and the relationships of many peptide-receptor systems have been clarified. However, we lack a detailed picture of neuropeptide evolution in lophotrochozoans as in-depth studies only exist for molluscs and annelids. Here we analyse peptidergic systems in Nemertea, Brachiopoda and Phoronida. We screened transcriptomes from thirteen nemertean, six brachiopod and four phoronid species for proneuropeptides and neuropeptide GPCRs. With mass spectrometry from the nemertean Lineus longissimus, we validated several predicted peptides and identified novel ones. Molecular phylogeny combined with peptide-sequence and gene-structure comparisons allowed us to comprehensively map spiralian neuropeptide evolution. We found most mollusc and annelid peptidergic systems also in nemerteans, brachiopods and phoronids. We uncovered previously hidden relationships including the orthologies of spiralian CCWamides to arthropod agatoxin-like peptides and of mollusc APGWamides to RGWamides from annelids, with orthologues systems in nemerteans, brachiopods and phoronids. We found that pleurin neuropeptides previously only found in molluscs are also present in nemerteans and brachiopods. We also identified cases of gene family duplications and losses. These include a protostome-specific expansion of RFamide/Wamide signalling, a spiralian expansion of GnRH-related peptides, and duplications of vasopressin/oxytocin before the divergence of brachiopods, phoronids and nemerteans. This analysis expands our knowledge of peptidergic signalling in spiralians and protostomes. Our annotated dataset of nearly 1,300 proneuropeptide sequences and 600 GPCRs presents a useful resource for further studies of neuropeptide signalling in protostomes.",

    "abstract": "BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a tumor suppressor and its loss can result in mesothelioma, uveal and cutaneous melanoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer. BAP1 is a deubiquitinating enzyme of the UCH class that has been implicated in various cellular processes like cell growth, cell cycle progression, ferroptosis and ER metabolic stress response. ASXL proteins activate BAP1 by forming the polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex which acts on H2AK119ub1. Besides the ASXL proteins, BAP1 is known to interact with an established set of additional proteins.\n\nHere, we identify novel BAP1 interacting proteins in the cytoplasm by expressing GFP-tagged BAP1 in an endogenous BAP1 deficient cell line using affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP-MS) analysis. Among these novel interacting proteins are Histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) and all subunits of the heptameric coat protein complex I (COPI) that is involved in vesicle formation and protein cargo binding and sorting. We validate that the HAT1 and COPI interactions occur at endogenous levels but find that this interaction with COPI is not mediated through the C-terminal KxKxx cargo sorting signals of the COPI complex.",

Many analytical pipelines exist for the automation of this analysis and some tools exist for the subsequent representation and inspection of the results of these pipelines. Mass Dynamics 1.0 (MD 1.0) is a web based analysis environment that can analyze and visualize LFQ data produced by software such as Maxquant. Unlike other tools, MD 1.0 utilizes cloud-based architecture to enable researchers to store their data, enabling researchers to not only automatically process and visualize their LFQ data but annotate and share their findings with collaborators and, if chosen, to easily publish results to the community. With a view toward increased reproducibility and standardisation in proteomics data analysis and streamlining collaboration between researchers, MD 1.0 requires minimal parameter choices and automatically generates quality control reports to verify experiment integrity. Here, we demonstrate that MD 1.0 provides reliable results for protein expression quantification, emulating Perseus on benchmark datasets over a wide dynamic range.\n\nThe MD 1.0 platform is available globally via: https://app.massdynamics.com/.\n\nContactwebb@wehi.edu.au",

    "abstract": "Viscosity is a key property of cell membranes that controls mobility of embedded proteins and membrane remodeling. Measuring it is challenging because existing approaches involve complex experimental designs and/or models, and the applicability of some is limited to specific systems and membrane compositions. As a result there is scarcity of data and the reported values for membrane viscosity vary by orders of magnitude for the same system. Here, we show how viscosity of bilayer membranes can be obtained from the transient deformation of giant unilamellar vesicles. The approach enables a non-invasive, probe-independent and high-throughput measurement of the viscosity of bilayers made of lipids or polymers with a wide range of compositions and phase state. Pure lipid and single-phase mixed bilayers are found to behave as Newtonian fluids with strain-rate independent viscosity, while phase-separated and diblock-copolymers systems exhibit shear-thinning in the explored range of strain rates 1-2000 s-1. The results also reveal that electrically polarized bilayers can be significantly more viscous than charge-neutral bilayers. These findings suggest that biomembrane viscosity is a dynamic property that can be actively modulated not only by composition but also by membrane polarization, e.g., as in action potentials.",

    "abstract": "In Drosophila, changes to dietary protein elicit different body size responses between the sexes. Whether this sex difference in nutrient-dependent body size regulation extends to other nutrients, such as dietary sugar, remains unclear. Here, we show that reducing dietary sugar enhanced body size in Drosophila male and female larvae. Indeed, the largest body size was found in larvae reared in a diet without added sugar. Despite the equivalent body size effects of a low sugar diet between males and females, we detected sex-specific changes to the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IIS) and target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathways. Further, we show that the metabolic changes observed in larvae reared on a low sugar diet differ between the sexes. Thus, despite identical phenotypic responses to dietary sugar in males and females, distinct changes to cell signaling pathways and whole-body metabolism were associated with the increased body size in each sex. This highlights the importance of including both sexes in all mechanistic studies on larval growth, as males and females may use different molecular and metabolic mechanisms to achieve similar phenotypic outcomes.",

To date the regenerative capacities of various life-essential functions tend to be evaluated on an ad hoc basis, with only a handful of functions tested at once and only successful results typically reported. Here, we develop a framework for systematically evaluating the capacity of a system to remake itself. Using the cell-free Protein synthesis Using Recombinant Elements (PURE) as a model system we apply our framework to evaluate the capacity of PURE, whose composition is completely known, to remake 36 life-essential functions. We find that only 23 of the components can be well tested and that only 19 of the 23 can be remade by the system itself; translation release factors remade by PURE are not fully functional. From both a qualitative and quantitative perspective PURE alone cannot remake PURE. We represent our findings via a standard visual form we call the Pureiodic Table that serves as a tool for tracking which life-essential functions can work together in remaking one another and what functions remain to be remade. We curate and represent all available data to create an expanded Pureiodic Table in support of collective coordination among ongoing but independent synthetic cell building efforts.

However, the developmental principles shaping brain network dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we report the longitudinal development of large-scale brain network dynamics during childhood and adolescence, and its connection with gene expression profiles. Using a multilayer network model, we show the temporally varying modular architecture of child brain networks, with higher network switching primarily in the association cortex and lower switching in the primary regions. This topographical profile exhibits progressive maturation, which manifests as reduced modular dynamics, particularly in the transmodal (e.g., default-mode and frontoparietal) and sensorimotor regions. These developmental refinements mediate age-related enhancements of global network segregation and are linked with the expression profiles of genes associated with the enrichment of ion transport and nucleobase-containing compound transport. These results highlight a progressive stabilization of brain dynamics, which expand our understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie cognitive development.",

    "abstract": "PurposeLung transplant (LT) recipients experience episodes of immune-mediated acute lung allograft dysfunction (ALAD). We have applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells of stable and ALAD patients to determine key cellular elements in dysfunctional lung allografts. Our particular focus here is on studying alveolar macrophages (AMs) as scRNAseq enables us to elucidate their heterogeneity and possible association with ALAD where our knowledge from cytometry-based assays is very limited.\n\nMethodsFresh bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from 6 LT patients, 3 with stable lung function (3044 {+/-} 1519 cells) and 3 undergoing an episode of ALAD (2593 {+/-} 904 cells) were used for scRNAseq. R Bioconductor and Seurat were used to perform QC, dimensionality reduction, annotation, pathway analysis, and trajectory. Donor and recipient deconvolution was performed using single nucleotide variations.\n\nResultsOur data revealed that AMs are highly heterogeneous (12 transcriptionally distinct subsets in stable). We identified two AM subsets uniquely represented in ALAD. Based on pathway analysis and the top differentially expressed genes in BAL we annotated them as pro-inflammatory interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) and metallothioneins-mediated inflammatory (MT). Pseudotime analysis suggested that ISG AMs represent an earlier stage of differentiation which may suggest them as monocyte drive macrophages. Our functional analysis on an independent set of BAL samples shows that ALAD samples have significantly higher expression of CXCL10, a marker of ISG AM, as we as higher secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Single nucleotide variation calling algorithm has allowed us to identify macrophages of donor origin and demonstrated that donor AMs are lost with time post-transplant.\n\nConclusionUsing scRNAseq, we observed AMs heterogeneity and identified specific subsets that may be associated with allograft dysfunction. Further exploration with scRNAseq will shed light on LT immunobiology and the role of AMs in allograft injury and dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite the profound number of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) patients now treated with PD-1 blockade, insight into the underpinnings of rational therapeutic strategies to treat resistance to checkpoint immunotherapy remain unrealized. Our objective was to develop a novel therapeutic approach to overcome primary resistance to PD-1 blockade in MPM.\n\nMethodsWe generated a transcriptome signature of resistance to PD-1 blockade in MPM patients treated with nivolumab (4 responders and 4 non-responders). We used the TCGA MPM cohort (N=73) to determine what genomic alterations were associated with the resistance signature. We tested whether regulation of identified molecules could overcome resistance to PD-1 blockade in an immunocompetent mouse malignant mesothelioma model.\n\nResultsImmunogenomic analysis by applying our anti-PD-1 resistance signature to the TCGA cohort revealed that deletion of CDKN2A was highly associated with primary resistance to PD-1 blockade. Under the hypothesis that resistance to PD-1 blockade can be overcome by CDK4/6 inhibition, we tested whether CDK4/6 inhibitors could overcome resistance to PD-1 blockade in subcutaneous tumors derived from Cdkn2a(-/-) AB1 malignant mesothelioma cells, which were resistant to PD-1 blockade. The combination of daily oral administration of CDK4/6 inhibitors (abemaciclib or palbociclib) and intraperitoneal anti-PD-1 treatment markedly suppressed tumor growth, compared with anti-PD-1 or CDK4/6 inhibitor alone.\n\nConclusionsWe identified a novel therapeutic target, CDK4/6, to overcome primary resistance to PD-1 blockade through comprehensive immunogenomic approaches. These data provide a rationale for undertaking clinical trials of CDK4/6 inhibitors in the more than 40% of patients with MPM who demonstrate loss of CDKN2A.",

Previously we had isolated a promising lipid producing yeast, Zygosaccharomyces siamensis AP1, from wild honey of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The strain was able to produce around 19% (w/w biomass) of lipid on glucose. However, its ability to produce lipid on other types of carbon source is still not studied. In this study, we compared the strain ability to produce lipid on glycerol and glucose using different C/N ratio. We also investigated optimum temperature, pH, and growth time for lipid production on glycerol. We found that growing the strain on glycerol with C/N ratio 120 gave the highest lipid content (29.7%). We also found that optimum growth temperature and pH are 30{degrees}C and 5, respectively. Maximum lipid biomass, 0.28 g/L, was produced when the strain was grown in the optimum conditions for 72 hours. In conclusion, our results suggest that glycerol is a potential cheap carbon source for lipid production from Z. siamensis AP1.

We show that multiple microbial strategies likely drive the development of xenobiotic degrading communities, notably (i) presence of genes encoding catabolic enzymes to degrade xenobiotics; (ii) presence of genes encoding efflux pumps; (iii) auxiliary catabolic genes on plasmids; and (iv) positive interactions dominate microbial communities with efficient degradation.

    "abstract": "Ageing-related processes are largely conserved, with simple organisms remaining the main platform to discover and dissect new ageing-associated genes. Yeasts provide potent model systems to study cellular ageing owing their amenability to systematic functional assays under controlled conditions. Even with yeast cells, however, ageing assays can be laborious and resource-intensive. Here we present improved experimental and computational methods to study chronological lifespan in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We decoded the barcodes for 3206 mutants of the latest gene-deletion library, enabling the parallel profiling of [~]700 additional mutants compared to previous screens. We then applied a refined method of barcode sequencing (Bar-seq), addressing technical and statistical issues raised by persisting DNA in dead cells and sampling bottlenecks in aged cultures, to screen for mutants showing altered lifespan during stationary phase. This screen identified 341 long-lived mutants and 1246 short-lived mutants which point to many previously unknown ageing-associated genes, including 51 conserved but entirely uncharacterized genes. The ageing-associated genes showed coherent enrichments in processes also associated with human ageing, particularly with respect to ageing in non-proliferative brain cells. We also developed an automated colony-forming unit assay for chronological lifespan to facilitate medium- to high-throughput ageing studies by saving time and resources compared to the traditional assay. Results from the Bar-seq screen showed good agreement with this new assay, validating 33 genes not previously associated with cellular ageing. This study provides an effective methodological platform and identifies many new ageing-associated genes as a framework for analysing cellular ageing in yeast and beyond.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYHuman induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and primary human cardiomyocytes are used for in vitro cardiac safety testing. hiPSC-CMs have been associated with a vast heterogeneity regarding single-cell morphology, beating behavior and action potential duration, prompting a systematic analysis of single-cell characteristics. Previously published hiPSC-CM studies revealed action potentials with nodal-, atrial- or ventricular-like morphology, although ion channel expression of singular hiPSC-CMs is not fully understood. Other studies used single-cell RNA-sequencing, however, these studies did not extensively focus on expression patterns of cardiac ion channels or failed to detect ion channel transcripts. Thus, the current study used a single-cell patch-clamp-RT-qPCR approach to get insights into single-cell electrophysiology (capacitance, action potential duration at 90% of repolarization, upstroke velocity, spontaneous beat rate, and sodium-driven fast inward current) and ion channel expression (HCN4, CACNA1G, CACNA1D, KCNA5, KCNJ4, SCN5A, KCNJ2, CACNA1D, and KCNH2), the combination of both within individual cells, and their correlations in single cardiomyocytes. We used commercially available hiPSC-CMs (iCell cardiomyocytes, atrial and ventricular Pluricytes) and primary human adult atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes. Recordings of electrophysiological parameters revealed differences between the cell groups and variation within the hiPSC-CMs groups as well as within primary ventricular cardiomyocytes. Expression analysis on mRNA level showed no-clear-cut discrimination between primary cardiac subtypes and revealed both similarities and differences between all cell groups. Higher expression of atrial-associated ion channels in primary atrial cardiomyocytes and atrial Pluricytes compared to their ventricular counterpart indicates a successful chamber-specific hiPSC differentiation. Interpretation of correlations between the single-cell parameters was challenging, as the total data set is complex, particularly for parameters depending on multiple processes, like the spontaneous beat rate. Yet, for example, expression of SCN5A correlated well with the fast inward current amplitude for all three hiPSC-CM groups. To further enhance our understanding of the physiology and composition of the investigated hiPSC-CMs, we compared beating and non-beating cells and assessed distributions of single-cell data. Investigating the single-cell phenotypes of hiPSC-CMs revealed a combination of attributes which may be interpreted as a mixture of traits of different adult cardiac cell types: (i) nodal-related pacemaking attributes are spontaneous generation of action potentials and high HCN4 expression; and (ii) non-nodal attributes: cells have a prominent INa-driven fast inward current, a fast upstroke velocity and a high expression of SCN5A. In conclusion, the combination of nodal- and non-nodal attributes in single hiPSC-CMs may hamper the interpretation of drug effects on complex electrophysiological parameters like beat rate and action potential duration. However, the proven expression of specific ion channels enables the evaluation of drug effects on ionic currents in a more realistic environment than in recombinant systems.",

However, reactogenicity, such as fever, caused by innate immune responses to the vaccine formulation remains to be improved. Here, we optimized a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based mRNA vaccine candidate, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (LNP-mRNA-RBD), which showed improved immunogenicity by removing reactogenic materials from the vaccine formulation and protective potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection in cynomolgus macaques. LNP-mRNA-RBD induced robust antigen-specific B cells and follicular helper T cells in the BALB/c strain but not in the C57BL/6 strain; the two strains have contrasting abilities to induce type I interferon production by dendritic cells. Removal of reactogenic materials from original synthesized mRNA by HPLC reduced type I interferon (IFN) production by dendritic cells, which improved immunogenicity. Immunization of cynomolgus macaques with an LNP encapsulating HPLC-purified mRNA induced robust anti-RBD IgG in the plasma and in various mucosal areas, including airways, thereby conferring protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, fine-tuning the balance between the immunogenic and reactogenic activity of mRNA-based vaccine formulations may offer safer and more efficacious outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Vaccines based on mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a promising new platform used by two leading vaccines against coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19). Clinical trials and ongoing vaccinations present with very high protection levels and varying degrees of side effects. However, the nature of the reported side effects remains poorly defined. Here we present evidence that LNPs used in many preclinical studies are highly inflammatory in mice. Intradermal injection of these LNPs led to rapid and robust inflammatory responses, characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration, activation of diverse inflammatory pathways, and production of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The same dose of LNP delivered intranasally led to similar inflammatory responses in the lung and resulted in a high mortality rate.\n\nIn summary, here we show that the LNPs used for many preclinical studies are highly inflammatory. Thus, their potent adjuvant activity and reported superiority comparing to other adjuvants in supporting the induction of adaptive immune responses likely stem from their inflammatory nature. Furthermore, the preclinical LNPs are similar to the ones used for human vaccines, which could also explain the observed side effects in humans using this platform.",

Each oligonucleotide comprises a 3 antisense sequence for target recognition and a 5-phosphorylated 2-5 poly(A)4 for guided ribonuclease L (RNase L) activation. Since RNase L can potently cleave single strand RNA during innate antiviral response, the improved degradation efficiency of chimeric oligonucleotides was twice as much as classic antisense oligonucleotides in Vero cells, for both SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets. In pseudovirus infection models, one of chimeric oligonucleotides targeting spike RNA achieved potent and broad-spectrum inhibition of both SARS-CoV-2 and its recently reported N501Y and/or {Delta}H69/{Delta}V70 mutants. These results showed that the constructed chimeric oligonucleotides could efficiently degrade pathogenic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 facilitated by immune activation, showing promising potentials as antiviral nucleic acid drugs for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Since understanding molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection is extremely important for developing effective therapies against COVID-19, we focused on the internalization mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 via ACE2. Although cigarette smoke is generally believed to be harmful to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) treatments were surprisingly found to suppress the expression of ACE2 in HepG2 cells. We thus tried to clarify the mechanism of CSE effects on expression of ACE2 in mammalian cells. Because RNA-seq analysis suggested that suppressive effects on ACE2 might be inversely correlated with induction of the genes regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), the AHR agonists 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ) and omeprazole (OMP) were tested to assess whether those treatments affected ACE2 expression. Both FICZ and OMP clearly suppressed ACE2 expression in a dose-dependent manner along with inducing CYP1A1. Knock-down experiments indicated a reduction of ACE2 by FICZ treatment in an AHR-dependent manner. Finally, treatments of AHR agonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection into Vero E6 cells as determined with immunoblotting analyses detecting SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleocapsid protein. We here demonstrate that treatment with AHR agonists, including CSE, FICZ, and OMP, decreases expression of ACE2 via AHR activation, resulting in suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Sod1) is a highly conserved and abundant antioxidant enzyme that detoxifies superoxide (O2-) by catalyzing its conversion to dioxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cells, we discovered that a major new aspect of the antioxidant function of Sod1 is to integrate O2 availability to promote NADPH production. The mechanism involves Sod1-derived H2O2 oxidatively inactivating the glycolytic enzyme, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which in turn re-routes carbohydrate flux to the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) to generate NADPH. The aerobic oxidation of GAPDH is exclusively dependent on and rate-limited by Sod1. Thus, Sod1 senses O2 via O2- to balance glycolytic and oxPPP flux, through control of GAPDH activity, for adaptation to life in air. Importantly, this new mechanism for Sod1 antioxidant activity requires the bulk of cellular Sod1, unlike for its role in protection against O2- toxicity, which only requires < 1% of total Sod1. Using mass spectrometry, we identified proteome-wide targets of Sod1-dependent redox signaling, including numerous metabolic enzymes. Altogether, Sod1-derived H2O2 is important for antioxidant defense and a master regulator of metabolism and the thiol redoxome.\n\nSignificance StatementCu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Sod1) is a key antioxidant enzyme and its importance is underscored by the fact that its ablation in cell and animal models results in oxidative stress, metabolic defects, and reductions in cell proliferation, viability, and lifespan. Curiously, Sod1 detoxifies superoxide radicals (O2-) in a manner that produces an oxidant as a byproduct, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). While much is known about the necessity of scavenging O2-, it is less clear what the physiological roles of Sod1-derived H2O2 are. Herein, we discovered that Sod1-derived H2O2 plays a very important role in antioxidant defense by stimulating the production of NADPH, a vital cellular reductant required for ROS scavenging enzymes, as well as redox regulating a large network of enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Many photosynthetic organisms enhance the performance of their CO2-fixing enzyme Rubisco by operating a CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM). Most CCMs in eukaryotic algae supply concentrated CO2 to Rubisco in an organelle called the pyrenoid. Ongoing efforts seek to engineer an algal CCM into crops that lack a CCM to increase yields. To advance our basic understanding of the algal CCM, we develop a chloroplast-scale reaction-diffusion model to analyze the efficacy and the energy efficiency of the CCM in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We show that achieving an effective and energetically efficient CCM requires a physical barrier such as thylakoid stacks or a starch sheath to reduce CO2 leakage out of the pyrenoid matrix. Our model provides insights into the relative performance of two distinct inorganic carbon uptake strategies: at air-level CO2, a CCM can operate effectively by taking up passively diffusing external CO2 and catalyzing its conversion to HCO3-, which is then trapped in the chloroplast; however, at lower external CO2 levels, effective CO2 concentration requires active import of HCO3-. We also find that proper localization of carbonic anhydrases can reduce futile carbon cycling between CO2 and HCO3-, thus enhancing CCM performance. We propose a four-step engineering path that increases predicted CO2 saturation of Rubisco up to seven-fold at a theoretical cost of only 1.5 ATP per CO2 fixed. Our system-level analysis establishes biophysical principles underlying the CCM that are broadly applicable to other algae and provides a framework to guide efforts to engineer an algal CCM into land plants.\n\nSignificance StatementEukaryotic algae mediate approximately one-third of CO2 fixation in the global carbon cycle. Many algae enhance their CO2-fixing ability by operating a CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM). Our model of the algal CCM lays a solid biophysical groundwork for understanding its operation. The models consistency with experimental observations supports existing hypotheses about the operating principles of the algal CCM and the functions of its component proteins. We provide a quantitative estimate of the CCMs energy efficiency and compare the performance of two distinct CO2 assimilation strategies under varied conditions. The model offers a quantitative framework to guide the engineering of an algal CCM into land plants and supports the feasibility of this endeavor.",

To better characterize the mechanisms of chemoresistance, we first identified genes whose expression is dysregulated in AML cells resistant to daunorubicin (DNR) or cytarabine (Ara-C), the main drugs used for the induction therapy. The genes found activated are mostly linked to immune signaling and inflammation. Among them, we identified a strong up-regulation of the NOX2 NAPDH oxidase subunit genes (CYBB, CYBA, NCF1, NCF2, NCF4 and RAC2). The ensuing increase in NADPH oxidase activity, which is particularly strong in DNR-resistant cells, participates in the acquisition and/or maintenance of resistance to DNR. In addition, analyzing gp91phox (CYBB-encoded Nox2 catalytic sub-unit) expression at the surface of leukemic blasts from 74 patients at diagnosis showed that NOX2 is generally more expressed and active in leukemic cells from the FAB M4/M5 subtypes compared to FAB M0-M2 ones. Using a gene expression-based score we demonstrate that high NOX2 subunit genes expression is a marker of adverse prognosis, independent of the cytogenetic-based risk classification, in AML patients.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesA number of immune populations have been implicated in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) pathogenesis. This study used mass cytometry (CyTOF) combined with transcriptomic analysis to generate a high-dimensional dataset of matched PsA synovial fluid (SF) and blood leucocytes, with the aim of identifying cytokine production ex vivo in unstimulated lymphoid and myeloid cells.\n\nMethodsFresh SF and paired blood were either fixed or incubated with protein transport inhibitors for 6 h. Samples were stained with two CyTOF panels: a phenotyping panel and an intracellular panel, including antibodies to both T cell and myeloid cell secreted proteins. Transcriptomic analysis by gene array of key expanded cell populations and single-cell RNA-seq, and ELISA and LEGENDplex analysis of PsA SF were also performed.\n\nResultsWe observed marked changes in the myeloid compartment of PsA SF relative to blood, with expansion of intermediate monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cell populations. Classical monocytes, intermediate monocytes and macrophages spontaneously produced significant levels of the proinflammatory mediators osteopontin and CCL2 in the absence of any in vitro stimulation. By contrast minimal spontaneous cytokine production by T cells was detected. Gene expression analysis showed the genes for osteopontin and CCL2 to be amongst those most highly upregulated by PsA monocytes/macrophages; and both proteins were elevated in PsA SF.\n\nConclusionsUsing multiomic analyses we have generated a comprehensive cellular map of PsA SF and blood to reveal key expanded myeloid proinflammatory modules in PsA of potential pathogenic and therapeutic importance.",

    "abstract": "Hematopoiesis is finely regulated to enable timely production of the right numbers and types of mature immune cells to maintain tissue homeostasis. Dysregulated hematopoiesis may compromise antiviral immunity and/or exacerbate immunopathogenesis. Herein, we report an essential role of UBXN3B in maintenance of hematopoietic homeostasis and restriction of immunopathogenesis during respiratory viral infection. Ubxn3b deficient (Ubxn3b-/-) mice are highly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A infection, characterized by more severe lung immunopathology, lower virus-specific IgG, significantly fewer B cells, but more myeloid cells than Ubxn3b+/+ littermates. This aberrant immune compartmentalization is recapitulated in uninfected Ubxn3b-/- mice. Mechanistically, UBXN3B controls precursor B-I (pre-BI) transition to pre-BII and subsequent proliferation in a cell-intrinsic manner, by maintaining BLNK protein stability and pre-BCR signaling. These results reveal an essential role of UBXN3B for the early stage of B cell development.",

IgG antibodies produced by intratumoral B cells may drive antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and enhance antigen presentation by dendritic cells6-8. Furthermore, B cells are efficient antigen-specific antigen presenters that can essentially modulate the behaviour of helper T cells9-11.\n\nHere we investigated the role of intratumoral IG isotype and clonality in bladder cancer. Our results show that the IgG1/IgA ratio offers a strong and independent prognostic indicator for the Basal squamous molecular subtype and for the whole ImVigor210 cohort in anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. Our findings also indicate that effector B cell functions, rather than clonally-produced antibodies, are involved in the antitumor response. High IgG1/IgA ratio was associated with relative abundance of cytotoxic genes and prominence of the IL-21/IL-21R axis suggesting importance of T cell/B cell interaction.\n\nWe integrated the B, NK, and T cell components, employing immFocus-like normalization to account for the stochastic nature of tumor tissue sampling. Using a random forest model with nested cross-validation, we developed a tumor RNA-Seq-based predictor of anti-PD-L1 therapy response in muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma. The resulting PRIMUS (PRedIctive MolecUlar Signature) predictor achieves superior sensitivity compared to PD-L1 expression scores or existing gene signatures, allowing for reliable identification of responders even within the desert patient subcohort analyzed as a hold out set.",

To investigate how ageing impacts the memory B cell response we tracked haemagglutinin specific B cells by indexed flow sorting and single cell RNA sequencing in twenty healthy adults administered the trivalent influenza vaccine. We found age-related skewing in the memory B cell compartment six weeks after vaccination, with younger adults developing haemagglutinin specific memory B cells with an FCRL5+ \"atypical\" phenotype, showing evidence of somatic hypermutation and positive selection, which happened to a lesser extent in older persons. We confirmed the germinal center ancestry of these FCRL5+ \"atypical\" memory B cells using scRNASeq from fine needle aspirates of influenza responding human lymph nodes and paired blood samples. Together, this study shows that the aged human germinal center reaction and memory B cell response following vaccination is defective.\n\nSummaryImmune responses to vaccination wane with age.

The model estimates some key parameters for phage therapeutic efficacy, in particular the impact of dose and route of administration on phage dynamics and the synergism of phage and the innate immune response on the bacterial clearance rate.

    "abstract": "In bacteria, the nucleotide-based second messenger bis-(3-5)-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) binds to effectors to generate outputs in response to changes in the environment. In Myxococcus xanthus, c-di-GMP regulates type IV pili-dependent motility and the starvation-induced developmental program that results in the formation of spore-filled fruiting bodies; however, little is known about the effectors that bind c-di-GMP. Here, we systematically inactivated all 24 genes encoding PilZ domain-containing proteins, which are among the most common c-di-GMP receptors. We confirm that PlpA, a stand-alone PilZ-domain protein, is specifically important for motility and that Pkn1, which is composed of a Ser/Thr domain and a PilZ domain, is specifically important for development. Moreover, we identify two PilZ-domain proteins that have distinct functions in regulating motility and development. PixB, which is composed of two PilZ domains and an acetyltransferase domain, binds c-di-GMP in vitro and regulates type IV pili-dependent and gliding motility upstream of the Frz chemosensory system as well as development. The acetyltransferase domain is required and sufficient for function during growth while all three domains and c-di-GMP binding are essential for PixB function during development. PixA is a response regulator composed of a PilZ domain and a receiver domain, binds c-di-GMP in vitro, and regulates motility downstream of the Frz chemosensory system by setting up the polarity of the two motility systems. Our results support a model whereby the three proteins PlpA, PixA and PixB act in parallel pathways and have distinct functions to regulation of motility.\n\nImportancec-di-GMP signaling controls bacterial motility in many bacterial species by binding to downstream effector proteins. Here, we identify two PilZ domain-containing proteins in Myxococcus xanthus that bind c-di-GMP. We show that PixB, which contains two PilZ domains and an acetyltransferase domain, acts upstream of the Frz chemosensory system to regulate motility via the acetyltransferase domain while the intact protein and c-di-GMP binding are essential for PixB to support development. By contrast, PixA acts downstream of the Frz system to regulate motility. Together with previous observations, we conclude that PilZ-domain proteins and c-di-GMP act in multiple parallel pathways to regulate motility and development in M. xanthus.",

    "abstract": "The anaerobic gut fungi (AGF, phylum Neocallimastigomycota) reside in the alimentary tracts of herbivores. Multiple novel, yet-uncultured AGF taxa have recently been identified in culture-independent diversity surveys. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of the first representative of the RH5 lineage from fecal samples of a wild blackbuck (Indian Antelope) from Sutton County, Texas, USA. The isolates displayed medium sized (2-4 mm) compact circular colonies on agar roll tubes and thin loose biofilm-like growth in liquid medium. Microscopic examination revealed monoflagellated zoospores and polycentric thalli with highly branched nucleated filamentous rhizomycelium, a growth pattern encountered in a minority of described AGF genera so far. The obtained isolates are characterized by formation of spherical vesicles at the hyphal tips from which multiple sporangia formed either directly on the spherical vesicles or at the end of sporangiophores. Phylogenetic analysis using the D1/D2 regions of the large ribosomal subunit (D/D2 LSU) and the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) revealed sequence similarities of 93.5%, and 81.3%, respectively, to the closest cultured relatives (Orpinomyces joyonii strain D3A (D1/D2 LSU), and Joblinomyces apicalis strain GFH681 (ITS1).

We propose accommodating these novel isolates in a new genus and species, for which the name Paucimyces polynucleatus is proposed. The type species is strain BB-3.",

    "abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, traverses through vastly distinct environments between the tick vector and the multiple phases of the mammalian infection that requires genetic adaptation for the progression of pathogenesis. Borrelial gene expression is highly responsive to changes in specific environmental signals that initiate the RpoS regulon for mammalian adaptation, but the mechanism(s) for direct detection of environmental cues has yet to be identified. Secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) produced by adenylate cyclase is responsive to environmental signals, such as carbon source and pH, in many bacterial pathogens to promote virulence by altering gene regulation. B. burgdorferi encodes a single non-toxin class IV adenylate cyclase (bb0723, cyaB). This study investigates cyaB expression along with its influence on borrelial virulence regulation and mammalian infectivity. Expression of cyaB was specifically induced with co-incubation of mammalian host cells that was not observed with cultivated tick cells suggesting that cyaB expression is influenced by cellular factor(s) unique to mammalian cell lines. The 3 end of cyaB also encodes a small RNA, SR0623, in the same orientation that overlaps with bb0722. The differential processing of cyaB and SR0623 transcripts may alter the ability to influence function in the form of virulence determinant regulation and infectivity. Two independent cyaB deletion B31 strains were generated in 5A4-NP1 and ML23 backgrounds and complemented with the cyaB ORF alone that truncates SR0623, cyaB with intact SR0623, or cyaB with a mutagenized full length SR0623 to evaluate the influence on transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of borrelial virulence factors and infectivity. In the absence of cyaB, expression and production of ospC was significantly reduced, while the protein levels for BosR and DbpA were substantially lower than parental strains. Infectivity studies with both independent cyaB mutants demonstrated an attenuated phenotype with reduced colonization of tissues during early disseminated infection. This work suggests that B. burgdorferi utilizes cyaB and potentially cAMP as a regulatory pathway to modulate borrelial gene expression and protein production to promote borrelial virulence and dissemination in the mammalian host.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive mutations can cause drug resistance in cancers and pathogens, and increase the tolerance of agricultural pests and diseases to chemical treatment. When and how adaptive mutations form is often hard to discern, but we have shown that adaptive copy number amplification of the copper resistance gene CUP1 occurs in response to environmental copper due to CUP1 transcriptional activation. Here we dissect the mechanism by which CUP1 transcription in budding yeast stimulates copy number variation (CNV). We show that transcriptionally stimulated CNV requires TREX-2 and Mediator, such that cells lacking TREX-2 or Mediator respond normally to copper but cannot acquire increased resistance. Mediator and TREX-2 cause replication stress by tethering transcribed loci to nuclear pores, a process known as gene gating, and transcription at the CUP1 locus causes a TREX-2-dependent accumulation of replication forks indicative of replication fork stalling. TREX-2-dependent CUP1 gene amplification occurs by a Rad52 and Rad51-mediated homologous recombination mechanism that is enhanced by histone H3K56 acetylation and repressed by Pol32, factors known to alter the frequency of template switching during break induced replication (BIR). CUP1 amplification is also critically dependent on late firing replication origins present in the CUP1 repeats, and mutations that remove or inactivate these origins strongly suppress the acquisition of copper resistance. We propose that replicative stress imposed by nuclear pore association causes replication bubbles from these origins to collapse soon after firing, leaving an epigenetic scar of H3K56 acetylation that promotes template switching during later break induced replication events. The capacity for inefficient replication origins to promote copy number variation renders certain genomic regions more fragile than others, and therefore more likely to undergo adaptive evolution through de novo gene amplification.",

Clonal monoallelic expression was not observed in ESCs, but when we assessed expression status in more than 200 clones of neuronal progenitor cells, we observed high frequencies of monoallelism. We uncovered unforeseen modes of allelic expression that appear to be gene-specific and epigenetically regulated.

    "abstract": "Studying genetic variation of gene expression provides a powerful way to unravel the molecular components underlying complex traits. Expression QTL studies have been performed in several different model species, yet most of these linkage studies have been based on genetic segregation of two parental alleles. Recently we developed a multi-parental segregating population of 200 recombinant inbred lines (mpRILs) derived from four wild isolates (JU1511, JU1926, JU1931 and JU1941) in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We used RNA-seq to investigate how multiple alleles affect gene expression in these mpRILs. We found 1,789 genes differentially expressed between the parental lines. Transgression, expression beyond any of the parental lines in the mpRILs, was found for 7,896 genes. For expression QTL mapping almost 9,000 SNPs were available. By combining these SNPs and the RNA-seq profiles of the mpRILs, we detected almost 6,800 eQTLs. Most trans-eQTLs (63%) co-locate in six newly identified trans-bands. The trans-eQTLs found in previous 2-parental allele eQTL experiments and this study showed some overlap (17.5%- 46.8%), highlighting on the one hand that a large group of genes is affected by polymorphic regulators across populations and conditions, on the other hand it shows that the mpRIL population allows identification of novel gene expression regulatory loci. Taken together, the analysis of our mpRIL population provides a more refined insight into C. elegans complex trait genetics and eQTLs in general, as well as a starting point to further test and develop advanced statistical models for detection of multi-allelic eQTLs and systems genetics studying the genotype-phenotype relationship.",

    "abstract": "Guava is a small, tropical fruit tree grown in various tropical and subtropical regions. Salicylic acid (SA) is a phenolic compound that enhances disease resistance and delays the fruit ripening process. Calcium is an essential cell component that delays ripening, particularly softening of the fruit. The effect of foliar spray of CaCl2, and SA, on the physical and biochemical traits of guava was investigated in the present investigation. The application of CaCl2 2% + SA 2mM was more effective as compared with both when applied alone. The data were recorded on fruit set (%), fruit weight (g), fruit length (cm), fruit diameter (cm), fruit yield (kg), ripening period (days), TSS, acidity, total sugar, ascorbic acid, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium. CaCl2 2% + SA 2mM was showed better performance in all cases, followed by SA 2mM and CaCl2 2%. Overall, this work determines the influence on guava's essential traits by pre-harvest calcium chloride and salicylic acid.",

    "abstract": "The global efforts in the past few months have led to the discovery of around 200 drug repurposing candidates for COVID-19. Although most of them only exhibited moderate anti- SARS-CoV-2 activity, gaining more insights into their mechanisms of action could facilitate a better understanding of infection and the development of therapeutics. Leveraging large-scale drug-induced gene expression profiles, we found 36% of the active compounds regulate genes related to cholesterol homeostasis and microtubule cytoskeleton organization. The expression change upon drug treatment was further experimentally confirmed in human lung primary small airway. Following bioinformatics analysis on COVID-19 patient data revealed that these genes are associated with COVID-19 patient severity. The expression level of these genes also has predicted power on anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy in vitro, which led to the discovery of monensin as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero-E6 cells. The final survey of recent drug- combination data indicated that drugs co-targeting cholesterol homeostasis and microtubule cytoskeleton organization processes more likely present a synergistic effect with antivirals. Therefore, potential therapeutics should be centered around combinations of targeting these processes and viral proteins.",

    "abstract": "Multiple RNA polymerases (RNAPs) transcribing a gene have been known to exhibit collective group behavior, causing the transcription elongation rate to increase with the rate of transcription initiation. Such behavior has long been believed to be driven by a physical interaction or \"push\" between closely spaced RNAPs. However, recent studies have posited that RNAPs separated by longer distances may cooperate via the DNA segment under transcription. Here, we present a theoretical model incorporating the mechanical coupling between RNAP translocation and the torsional response of supercoiled DNA. Using stochastic simulations, we demonstrate long-range cooperation between co-transcribing RNAPs mediated by DNA supercoiling. We find that inhibiting transcription initiation can slow down the already recruited RNAPs, in agreement with recent experimental observations, and predict that the average transcription elongation rate varies non-monotonically with the rate of transcription initiation. We further show that while RNAPs transcribing neighboring genes oriented in tandem can cooperate, those transcribing genes in divergent or convergent orientations can act antagonistically, and that such behavior holds over a large range of intergenic separations. Our model makes testable predictions, revealing how the mechanical interplay between RNAPs and the DNA they transcribe can govern a key cellular process.",

    "abstract": "Morphogenesis is a spatially and temporally regulated process involved in various physiological and pathological transformations. In addition to the associated biochemical factors, the physical regulation of morphogenesis has attracted increasing attention. However, the driving force of morphogenesis initiation remains elusive. Here, we show that during the growth of multi-layered tissues, morphogenetic process can be self-organized by the progression of compression gradient stemmed from the interfacial mechanical interactions between layers. In tissues with low fluidity, the compression gradient is progressively strengthened during growth and induces stratification by triggering symmetric-to-asymmetric cell division reorientation at the critical tissue size. In tissues with high fluidity, compression gradient is dynamic and induces cell junction remodelling regulated cell rearrangement leading to 2D in-plane morphogenesis instead of 3D deformation. Morphogenesis can be tuned by manipulating tissue fluidity, cell adhesion forces and mechanical properties to influence the progression of compression gradient during the development of cultured cell sheets and chicken embryos. Together, the dynamics of compression gradient arised from interfacial mechanical interaction provides a conserved mechanism underlying morphogenesis initiation and size control during tissue growth.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer death, with unclear mechanisms driving the transition to aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. The RAS[-&gt;]RAF[-&gt;]MEK[-&gt;]ERK pathway is hyper-activated in [~]50% of human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). An initial activating mutation induces homeostatic feedback mechanisms that limit ERK activity. Additional, undefined genetic hits overcome the feedback, leading to high ERK activity that drives malignant progression. At detection, the majority of LUADs express the homeobox transcription factor NKX2-1, which also limits malignant progression. NKX2-1 constrains LUAD, in part, by maintaining a well-differentiated state with features of pulmonary identity. We asked if loss of NKX2-1 might also contribute to the release of ERK activity that drives tumor progression. Using human tissue samples and cell lines, xenografts, and genetic mouse models, we show that NKX2-1 induces the ERK phosphatase DUSP6. In tumor cells from late-stage LUAD with silenced NKX2-1, re-introduction of NKX2-1 induces DUSP6 and inhibits cell proliferation and migration and tumor growth and metastasis. CRISPR knockout studies show that DUSP6 is necessary for NKX2-1-mediated inhibition of tumor progression in vivo. Further, DUSP6 expression is sufficient to inhibit RAS-driven LUAD. We conclude that NKX2-1 silencing, and thereby DUSP6 downregulation, is a mechanism by which early LUAD can unleash ERK hyperactivation for tumor progression.",

Using multi-omic assessment of cisplatin responsive and resistant human bladder cancer cell lines and whole-genome CRISPR screens, we identified NPEPPS, the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase as a novel driver of cisplatin resistance. Volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) have been shown to directly import the majority of intracellular cisplatin. Here, we show that the mechanism of NPEPPS-mediated cisplatin resistance is by binding to VRACs and blocking the import of cisplatin into the cell. We show that NPEPPS depletion increased intracellular cisplatin and made cisplatin-resistant cells more responsive to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of NPEPPS in cisplatin-sensitive cells decreased intracellular cisplatin and resulted in increased treatment resistance. The same results also hold for carboplatin. Our findings describe the first mechanism by which VRACs can be targeted to control the import of cisplatin and carboplatin.",

    "abstract": "Since the start of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 2 million deaths worldwide. Multiple vaccines have been deployed to date, but the continual evolution of the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) has recently challenged their efficacy. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 variants originating in the U.K. (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and New York (B.1.526) have reduced neutralization activity from convalescent sera and compromised the efficacy of antibody cocktails that received emergency use authorization. Whereas vaccines can be updated periodically to account for emerging variants, complementary strategies are urgently needed to avert viral escape. One potential alternative is the use of camelid VHHs (also known as nanobodies), which due to their small size can recognize protein crevices that are inaccessible to conventional antibodies. Here, we isolate anti-RBD nanobodies from llamas and \"nanomice\" we engineered to produce VHHs cloned from alpacas, dromedaries and camels. Through binding assays and cryo-electron microscopy, we identified two sets of highly neutralizing nanobodies. The first group expresses VHHs that circumvent RBD antigenic drift by recognizing a region outside the ACE2-binding site that is conserved in coronaviruses but is not typically targeted by monoclonal antibodies. The second group is almost exclusively focused to the RBD-ACE2 interface and fails to neutralize pseudoviruses carrying the E484K or N501Y substitutions. Notably however, they do neutralize the RBD variants when expressed as homotrimers, rivaling the most potent antibodies produced to date against SARS-CoV-2. These findings demonstrate that multivalent nanobodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 variant mutations through two separate mechanisms: enhanced avidity for the ACE2 binding domain, and recognition of conserved epitopes largely inaccessible to human antibodies. Therefore, while new SARS-CoV-2 mutants will continue to emerge, nanobodies represent promising tools to prevent COVID-19 mortality when vaccines are compromised.",

Here, we characterize the microbiota of the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and reveal extensive taxonomic and functional overlap with the root microbiota of land plants. Reconstitution experiments using synthetic communities derived from C. reinhardtii and Arabidopsis thaliana show that phycosphere and root bacteria assemble into taxonomically equivalent communities on either host. We show that provision of diffusible metabolites is not sufficient for phycosphere community establishment, which additionally requires physical proximity to the host.

Severe symptoms and high mortality, caused by cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome in the lower respiratory airway, are always associated with elderly individuals and those with comorbidities; whereas mild or moderate COVID-19 patients have limited upper respiratory flu-like symptoms. There is an urgent need to investigate SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses replication and immune responses in human respiratory systems. The human reconstituted airway epithelial air-liquid interface (ALI) models are the most physiologically relevant model for the investigation of coronavirus infection and virus-triggered innate immune signatures. We established ALI models representing both the upper and the lower respiratory airway to characterize the coronavirus infection kinetics, tissue pathophysiology, and innate immune signatures from upper and lower respiratory tract perspective. Our data suggested these in vitro ALI models maintain high physiological relevance with human airway tissues. The coronavirus induced immune response observed in these upper and lower respiratory airway models are similar to what has been reported in COVID-19 patients. The antiviral efficacy results of a few promising anti-coronavirus drugs in these models were consistent with previous reports and could be valuable for the human dose prediction.

    "abstract": "Generally, the physical, chemical and biological attributes of a soil combined with abiotic factors (e.g. climate and topography) drive pedogenesis. However, biological indicators of soil quality play no direct role in traditional soil classification and surveys. To support their inclusion in classification schemes, previous studies have shown that soil type is a key factor determining microbial community composition in arable soils. This suggests that soil type could be used as proxy for soil biological function and vice versa. In this study we assessed the relationship between soil biological indicators with either vegetation cover or soil type. A wide range of soil attributes were measured on soils from across the UK to investigate whether; (1) appropriate soil quality factors (SQFs) and indicators (SQIs) can be identified, (2) soil classification can predict SQIs; (3) which soil quality indicators were more effectively predicted by soil types, and (4) to what extent do soil types and/ or aggregate vegetation classes (AVCs) act as major regulators of SQIs. Factor analysis was used to group 20 soil attributes into six SQFs namely; Soil organic matter, Organic matter humification, Soluble nitrogen, Microbial biomass, Reduced nitrogen and Soil humification index. Of these, Soil organic matter was identified as the most important SQF in the discrimination of both soil types and AVCs. Among the measured soil attributes constituting the Soil organic matter factor were, microbial quotient and bulk density were the most important attributes for the discrimination of both individual soil types and AVCs. The Soil organic matter factor discriminated three soil type groupings and four aggregate vegetation class groupings. Only the Peat soil and Heath and bog AVC were distinctly discriminated from other groups. All other groups overlapped with one another, making it practically impossible to define reference values for each soil type or AVC. We conclude that conventionally classified soil types cannot predict the SQIs (or SQFs), but can be used in conjunction with the conventional soil classifications to characterise the soil types. The two-way ANOVA showed that the AVCs were a better regulator of the SQIs than the soil types and that they (AVCs) presented a significant effect on the soil type differences in the measured soil attributes.",

    "abstract": "Grouping sets of elements into smaller, equal-sized, subsets constitutes a perceptual strategy employed by humans and other animals to enhance cognitive performance. We hypothesized that asymmetrical grouping, a characteristic of prime numbers, could provide visual cues enabling discrimination of prime from non-prime numerosities. Newborn chicks were habituated to even numerosities (as sets of elements presented on a screen), and then tested for their spontaneous choice among a prime and a non-prime odd numerosity. Chicks discriminated and preferred the prime over the composite set of elements. We discuss this result in terms of novelty preference. By employing different contrasts (i.e., 7vs.9, 11vs.9, and 13vs.15) we investigated the limits of such mechanism showing that induced grouping positively affects chicks performance.",

    "abstract": "Kaolinite (Kt) is the most studied mineral, being widely used in the ceramic, pharmaceutical and cellulose industries, in addition to being the main soil mineral in the world. Found in different parts of the planet, it differs in genesis and may be formed as a result of local weathering of the rocks, occurring in the silt fraction; and also due to the minerals neogenesis with a predominance of clay-sized particles. The plain of upper Iguacu river has the largest kaolinitic deposit in the south of Brazil and its formation raised doubts if this kaolin was transported or formed in situ due the high organic matter in the alluvial plain. To elucidate the origin of kaolin deposits, we sampled a possible font of the mineral, in the mountains of Serra do Mar and sampled two tubes that reach 4 m depth in the upper Iguacu plain. We performed textural analysis, organic carbon, X-ray diffraction, Kt crystallography in silt and clay fractions, thermal analysis (TDA/TG) to quantify Kt and Gb in the clay fraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with dispersive energy spectroscopy (EDS). The TDA/TG analysis demonstrated that saprolite has 66% of the kaolinite found in the plain. The XRD analysis shows a significant presence of mica (Mc) in all samples of the silt fraction, both in Serra do Mar and in the plain. In SEM/EDS, crystals with planar growth are observed, and the presence of pseudomorphic Mc-Kt in the silt fraction of all analyzed samples, with emphasis on the tubes sample with the crystal having almost twice the size of that observed in the saprolite sample from Serra do Mar, allowing to infer that the Kt of the silt fraction of the wetland soils were formed on site by the diagenesis of mica particles. The results obtained in this work indicate that the kaolinitic material found in the wetland of the upper Iguacu plain is the result of weathering processes in the wetland itself, evidenced by the large pseudomorphs found, even greater than those observed in Serra do Mar.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress can produce reward system deficits (i.e. anhedonia) and other common symptoms associated with depressive disorders, as well as neural circuit hypofunction in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, the molecular mechanisms by which chronic stress promotes depressive-like behavior and hypofrontality remain unclear. We show here that the neuronal activity-regulated transcription factor, NPAS4, in the mPFC is regulated by chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), and its required in this brain region for CSDS-induced changes in sucrose preference and natural reward motivation. Interestingly, NPAS4 is not required for CSDS-induced social avoidance or anxiety-like behavior. We also find that mPFC NPAS4 is required for CSDS-induced reduction of pyramidal cell dendritic spine density, revealing a relationship between mPFC dendritic spine changes and anhedonia-like behavior, but not social avoidance behavior. Finally, transcriptomic analysis from the mPFC revealed that NPAS4 influences expression of numerous genes linked to glutamatergic synapses and ribosomal function, as well as many dysregulated genes observed in common neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression. Together our findings reveal an essential role for the activity-regulated transcription factor, NPAS4, in chronic stress-induced mPFC hypofunction and anhedonia.",

Electroconvulsive seizures (ECS) in animal models can help to inform our understanding of how electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) impacts the brain. ECS induces structural plasticity in neuronal dendrites in many brain regions, including the piriform cortex, a highly epileptogenic region that has also been implicated in depression. ECS-induced structural plasticity is associated with differential expression of unique isoforms encoding the neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but the functional significance of these transcripts in dendritic plasticity is not clear. Here, we demonstrate that different Bdnf isoforms are expressed non-stochastically across neurons of the piriform cortex following ECS. Specifically, cells expressing Bdnf exon 1-containing transcripts show a unique spatial recruitment pattern in response to ECS. We further demonstrate that Bdnf Ex1 expression in these cells is necessary for ECS-induced dendritic spine plasticity.",

Whether comparable sensitive periods exist for non-sensory cortices, such as the prefrontal cortex, in which alterations in activity determine adult circuit function and behavior is still an active area of research. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of prefrontal parvalbumin-expressing interneurons during the juvenile and adolescent period, results in persistent impairments in adult prefrontal circuit connectivity, in vivo network function and behavioral flexibility that can be reversed by targeted activation of parvalbumin interneurons in adulthood. In contrast, transient suppression of parvalbumin interneuron activity in adulthood produces no lasting effects. These findings identify an activity-dependent sensitive period for prefrontal circuit maturation and highlight how abnormal parvalbumin interneuron activity during development alters adult prefrontal circuit function and cognitive behavior.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThis scoping review explores the use of peptide microarrays in the fight against infectious diseases. The research domains explored included the use of peptide microarrays in the mapping of linear B-cell and T cell epitopes, antimicrobial peptide discovery, immunosignature characterisation and disease immunodiagnostics. This review also provides a short overview of peptide microarray synthesis.\n\nMethodsElectronic databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. The review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews and data charting was performed using a predefined form. The results were reported by narrative synthesis in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines.\n\nResultsEighty-six articles from 100 studies were included in the final data charting process. The majority (93%) of the articles were published during 2010-2020 and were mostly from Europe (44%) and North America (34 %). The findings were from the investigation of viral (44%), bacterial (30%), parasitic (25%) and fungal (2%) infections. Out of the serological studies, IgG was the most reported antibody type followed by IgM. The largest portion of the studies (78%) were related to mapping B-cell linear epitopes, 10% were on diagnostics, 9% reported on immunosignature characterisation and 6% reported on viral and bacterial cell binding assays. Two studies reported on T-cell epitope profiling.\n\nConclusionThe most important application of peptide microarrays was found to be B-cell epitope mapping or antibody profiling to identify diagnostic and vaccine targets. Immunosignatures identified by random peptide microarrays were found to be applied in the diagnosis of infections and interrogation of vaccine responses. The analysis of the interactions of random peptide microarrays with bacterial and viral cells using binding assays enabled the identification of antimicrobial peptides. Peptide microarray arrays were also used for T-cell linear epitope mapping which may provide more information for the design of peptide-based vaccines and for the development of diagnostic reagents.",

    "abstract": "The ability to reproduce the developmental events of trypanosomes that occur in their mammalian host in vitro offers significant potential to assist in understanding of the underlying biology of the process. For example, the transition from bloodstream slender to bloodstream stumpy forms is a quorum-sensing response to the parasite-derived peptidase digestion products of environmental proteins. As an abundant physiological substrate in vivo, we studied the ability of a basement membrane matrix enriched gel (BME) in the culture medium to support differentiation of pleomorphic Trypanosoma brucei to stumpy forms. BME comprises extracellular matrix proteins, which are among the most abundant proteins found in connective tissues in mammals and known substrates of parasite-released peptidases. We previously showed that two of these released peptidases are involved in generating a signal that promotes slender-to-stumpy differentiation. Here, we tested the ability of basement membrane extract to enhance parasite differentiation through its provision of suitable substrates to generate the quorum sensing signal, namely oligopeptides. Our results show that when grown in the presence of BME, T. brucei pleomorphic cells arrest at the G0/1 phase of the cell cycle and express the differentiation marker PAD1, the response being restricted to differentiation-competent parasites. Further, the stumpy forms generated in BME medium are able to efficiently proceed onto the next life cycle stage in vitro, procyclic forms, when incubated with cis-aconitate, further validating the in vitro BME differentiation system. Hence, BME provides a suitable in vitro substrate able to accurately recapitulate physiological parasite differentiation without the use of experimental animals.\n\nAuthor summaryAfrican trypanosome parasites responsible for human and animal trypanosomiasis, live extracellularly in their mammalian host and exploit environmental information to regulate their virulence and transmissibility. Morphological slender forms that proliferate in the mammalian host transform into the non-proliferative stumpy forms by receiving an extracellular signal generated by the accumulating parasites. Parasites secrete peptidases into the host that degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In this study, we evaluated the capacity to generate stumpy forms in vitro by including a basement membrane extract into the culture medium. We show that cells exposed to ECM proteins are able to differentiate efficiently into cell-cycle arrested stumpy forms and that the generated differentiation signal depends on the stumpy induction signalling pathway. This method can be used to generate stumpy forms in vitro, these being suitable for experimental analysis, thereby reducing the use of mice.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a longitudinal study of cryptosporidiosis from birth to three years of age in an urban slum of Dhaka Bangladesh. Fecal DNA was extracted from monthly surveillance samples and diarrheal stool samples collected from 392 infants from birth to three years. A pan-Cryptosporidium qPCR assay was used to identify sub-clinical and symptomatic cryptosporidiosis. Anthropometric measurements were collected quarterly to assess child nutritional status. 31% (121/392) of children experienced a single and 57% (222/392) multiple infections with Cryptosporidium. Repeat infections had a lower burden of parasites in the stool (Cq slope = -1.85; p<0.0001) and were more likely to be sub-clinical (Chi square test for trend; p=0.01). Repeat infections were associated with the development of growth faltering (Pearson correlation = -0.18; p=0.0004). High levels of fecal IgA antibodies against the Cryptosporidium Cp23 sporozoite protein at one year of life were associated with a delay in reinfection and amelioration of growth faltering through three years of life (HAZ IgA high responders -1.323 {+/-} 0.932 versus HAZ -1.731 {+/-} 0.984 p=0.0001). We concluded that nonsterile immunity to cryptosporidiosis in young children was associated with high levels of mucosal IgA anti-Cp23 and protection from diarrhea and growth faltering.\n\nAuthors SummaryCryptosporidium is one of the top causes of diarrhea and growth faltering in Bangladesh infants. We discovered that a prior infection resulted in incomplete immunity that protected from diarrhea and growth faltering but not infection and was associated with mucosal IgA against a sporozoite surface protein Cp23. The most important implication of these findings is that a cryptosporidiosis vaccine may not need to achieve complete protection from infection to have a beneficial impact on child health.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin modifying complexes play important yet not fully defined roles in DNA repair processes. The essential NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex is recruited to double-strand break (DSB) sites and spreads along with DNA end resection. As predicted, NuA4 acetylates surrounding nucleosomes upon DSB induction and defects in its activity correlate with altered DNA end resection and Rad51 recombinase recruitment. Importantly, we show that NuA4 is also recruited to the donor sequence during recombination along with increased H4 acetylation, indicating a direct role during strand invasion/D-loop formation after resection. We found that NuA4 cooperates locally with another HAT, the SAGA complex, during DSB repair as their combined action is essential for DNA end resection to occur. This cooperation of NuA4 and SAGA is required for recruitment of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, targeted acetylation of repair factors and homologous recombination. Our work reveals a multifaceted and conserved cooperation mechanism between acetyltransferase complexes to allow repair of DNA breaks by homologous recombination.\n\nKey Points-NuA4-dependent acetylation modulates nucleosome dynamics to assist DNA end resection and strand invasion during homologous recombination.\n-Combined recruitment and local action of NuA4 and SAGA acetyltransferase complexes is essential for DNA end resection.\n-Cooperation between NuA4 and SAGA acetyltransferases is required for homologous recombination in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow (BM) reside in HSC niches ensuring their maintenance. The HSC niche is made up of perivascular and trabecular cells including osteoblasts whose role on HSCs remains to be clearly defined. Increased numbers of osteoblasts have been observed in the CL2 transgenic mouse expressing a constitutively activated form of the parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related peptide receptor. This mouse model mimicking PTH anabolic effect has also been described to exhibit increased numbers of the BM stem/progenitor population. Furthermore, PTH is known to induce BM stem/progenitor cell migration into blood circulation. However PTH role on long-term repopulating HSCs (LT-HSCs) is incompletely known. Here we show that CL2 BM contains a regular proportion of LT-HSCs, suggesting that osteoblasts may not be a determinant of LT-HSC numbers but act mainly on more mature progenitors. We further show increased LT-HSC migration in CL2 mice correlated with higher granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) serum levels, supporting the idea that PTH can enhance the migration of LT-HSCs. Finally, we found a defect in the ability of CL2 BM HSCs to reconstitute irradiated BM suggesting that PTH activation of osteoblasts negatively influences abilities of HSC population to engraft and reconstitute irradiated BM. In summary, our study highlights new insights into the role of the PTH-dependent activation of osteoblasts on LT-HSC migration and their BM repopulation abilities.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe NLRP3 inflammasome is a critical component of sterile inflammation, which is involved in many diseases. However, there is currently no known proximal biomarker for measuring NLRP3 activation in pathological conditions. Protein kinase D (PKD) has emerged as an important NLRP3 kinase that catalyzes the release of a phosphorylated NLRP3 species that is competent for inflammasome complex assembly.\n\nMethodsTo explore the potential for PKD activation to serve as a selective biomarker of the NLRP3 pathway, we tested various stimulatory conditions in THP-1 and U937 cell lines, probing the inflammasome space beyond NLRP3. We analyzed the correlation between PKD activation (monitored by its auto-phosphorylation) and functional inflammasome readouts.\n\nResultsPKD activation/auto-phosphorylation always preceded cleavage of caspase-1 and gasdermin D, and treatment with the PKD inhibitor CRT0066101 could block NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and interleukin-1{beta} production. Conversely, blocking NLRP3 either genetically or using the MCC950 inhibitor prevented PKD auto-phosphorylation, indicating a bidirectional functional crosstalk between NLRP3 and PKD. Further assessments of the pyrin and NLRC4 pathways, however, revealed that PKD auto-phosphorylation can be triggered by a broad range of stimuli unrelated to NLRP3 inflammasome assembly.\n\nConclusionAlthough PKD and NLRP3 become functionally interconnected during NLRP3 activation, the promiscuous reactivity of PKD challenges its potential use for tracing the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.",

We demonstrate that the combination of SWIR in vivo imaging in the NIRIIb region (1500-1700 nm) with advanced deep learning image analysis allows to overcome these obstacles and making a large step forward to high resolution imaging: it allows to precisely segment vessels from tissues and noise, provides morphological structure of the vessels network, with learned pseudo-3D shape, their relative position, dynamic information of blood vascularization in depth in small animals and distinguish the vessels types: artieries and veins. For demonstration we use neural network IterNet that exploits structural redundancy of the blood vessels, which provides a useful analysis tool for raw SWIR images.",

    "abstract": "In the physicists perspective, epithelial tissues constitute an exotic type of active matter with non-linear properties reminiscent of amorphous materials. In the context of a circular proliferating epithelium, modeled by the quasistatic vertex model, we identify novel discrete tissue scale rearrangements, i.e. cellular flow avalanches, which are a form of collective cell movement. During the avalanches, the cellular trajectories are radial in the periphery and form a vortex in the core. After the onset of these avalanches, the epithelial area grows discontinuously. The avalanches are found to be stochastic, and their strength is determined by the density of cells in the tissue. Overall, avalanches regularize the spatial tension distribution along tissue. Furthermore, the avalanche distribution is found to obey a power law, with an exponent consistent with sheer induced avalanches in amorphous materials. To decipher the role of avalanches in organ development, we simulate epithelial growth of the Drosophila eye disc during the third instar using a computational model, which includes both signaling and mechanistic signalling. During the third instar, the morphogenetic furrow (MF), a [~]10 cell wide wave of apical area constriction propagates through the epithelium, making it a system with interesting mechanical properties. These simulations are used to understand the details of the growth process, the effect of the MF on the growth dynamics on the tissue scale, and to make predictions. The avalanches are found to depend on the strength of the apical constriction of cells in the MF, with stronger apical constriction leading to less frequent and more pronounced avalanches. The results herein highlight the dependence of simulated tissue growth dynamics on relaxation timescales, and serve as a guide for in vitro experiments.",

    "abstract": "Numerous species of aquatic invertebrates, including crustaceans, swim by oscillating multiple closely spaced appendages. The coordinated, out-of-phase motion of these appendages, known as \"metachronal paddling\", has been well-established to improve swimming performance relative to synchronous paddling. Invertebrates employing this propulsion strategy cover a wide range of body sizes and shapes, but the ratio of appendage spacing (G) to the appendage length (L) has been reported to lie in a comparatively narrow range of 0.2 < G/L [&le;] 0.65. The functional role of G/L on metachronal swimming performance is unknown. We hypothesized that for a given Reynolds number and stroke amplitude, hydrodynamic interactions promoted by metachronal stroke kinematics with small G/L can increase forward swimming speed. We used a dynamically scaled self-propelling robot to comparatively examine swimming performance and wake development of metachronal and synchronous paddling under varying G/L, phase lag, and stroke amplitude. G/L was varied from 0.4 to 1.5, with the expectation that when G/L is large, there should be no performance difference between metachronal and synchronous paddling due to a lack of interaction between vortices that form on the appendages. Metachronal stroking at non-zero phase lag with G/L in the biological range produced faster swimming speeds than synchronous stroking. As G/L increased and as stroke amplitude decreased, the influence of phase lag on the swimming speed of the robot was reduced. For smaller G/L, vortex interactions between adjacent appendages generated a horizontally-oriented wake and increased momentum fluxes relative to larger G/L, which contributed to increasing swimming speed. We find that while metachronal motion augments swimming performance for closely spaced appendages (G/L < 1), moderately spaced appendages (1.0 [&le;] G/L [&le;] 1.5) can benefit from metachronal motion only when the stroke amplitude is large.",

However, there is a significant need to identify novel valuable biomarkers in the context of targeted therapies, such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy.\n\nMethodsGene expression data and clinical information of DLBCL were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. 371 immune-related hub genes in DLBCL patients with different IPI levels were identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and 8 genes were selected to construct an IPI-based immune prognostic model (IPI-IPM). Afterward, the genetic, somatic mutational and molecular profiles of IPI-IPM subgroups were analyzed, as well as the potential clinical response of ICB in different IPI-IPM subgroups.\n\nResultsThe IPI-IPM was constructed based on the expression of CMBL, TLCD3B, SYNDIG1, ESM1, EPHA3, HUNK, PTX3 and IL12A, where high-risk patients had shorter overall survival (OS) than low-risk patients, consistent with the results in the GEO cohorts. The comprehensive results showed that high IPI-IPM risk scores were correlated with immune-related signaling pathways, high KMT2D and CD79B mutation rates, as well as up-regulation of inhibitory immune checkpoints including PD-L1, BTLA and SIGLEC7, indicating more potential response to ICB therapy.\n\nConclusionThe IPI-IPM has independent prognostic significance for DLBCL patients, which provides an immunological perspective to elucidate the mechanisms on tumor progression, also sheds a light on developing immunotherapy for DLBCL.",

    "abstract": "To determine the underlying mechanistic differences between diagnoses of Heart Failure (HF) and specifically heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF & HFpEF), a closed loop model of the cardiovascular system coupled with patient specific transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and right heart catheterization (RHC) measures was used to identify key parameters representing cardiovascular hemodynamics. Thirty-one patient records (10 HFrEF, 21 HFpEF) were obtained from the Cardiovascular Health Improvement Project (CHIP) database at the University of Michigan. Model simulations were tuned to match RHC and TTE pressure, volume and cardiac output measures in each patient with average error between data and model of 4.87 {+/-} 2%. The underlying physiological model parameters were then plotted against model-based norms and compared between the HFrEF and HFpEF group. Our results confirm that the main mechanistic parameter driving HFrEF is reduced left ventricular contractility, while for HFpEF a much wider underlying phenotype is presented. Conducting principal component analysis (PCA), k-means, and hierarchical clustering on the optimized model parameters, but not on clinical measures, shows a distinct group of HFpEF patients sharing characteristics with the HFrEF cohort, a second group that is distinct as HFpEF and a group that exhibits characteristics of both. Significant differences are observed (p-value<.001) in left ventricular active contractility and left ventricular relaxation, when comparing HFpEF patients to those grouped as similar to HFrEF. These results suggest that cardiovascular system modeling of standard clinical data is able to phenotype and group HFpEF as different subdiagnoses, possibly elucidating patient-specific treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundExperimental proof of gene function assignments in plants is based on mutant analyses. T-DNA insertion lines provided an invaluable resource of mutants and enabled systematic reverse genetics-based investigation of the functions of Arabidopsis thaliana genes during the last decades.\n\nResultsWe sequenced the genomes of 14 A. thaliana GABI-Kat T-DNA insertion lines, which eluded flanking sequence tag-based attempts to characterize their insertion loci, with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long reads. Complex T-DNA insertions were resolved and 11 previously unknown T-DNA loci identified, resulting in about 2 T-DNA insertions per line and suggesting that this number was previously underestimated. T-DNA mutagenesis caused fusions of chromosomes along with compensating translocations to keep the gene set complete throughout meiosis. Also, an inverted duplication of 800 kbp was detected. About 10% of GABI-Kat lines might be affected by chromosomal rearrangements, some of which do not involve T-DNA. Local assembly of selected reads was shown to be a computationally effective method to resolve the structure of T-DNA insertion loci. We developed an automated workflow to support investigation of long read data from T-DNA insertion lines. All steps from DNA extraction to assembly of T-DNA loci can be completed within days.\n\nConclusionLong read sequencing was demonstrated to be an effective way to resolve complex T-DNA insertions and chromosome fusions. Many T-DNA insertions comprise not just a single T-DNA, but complex arrays of multiple T-DNAs. It is becoming obvious that T-DNA insertion alleles must be characterized by exact identification of both T-DNA::genome junctions to generate clear genotype-to-phenotype relations.",

    "abstract": "Patients harboring mutations in the PI3K-AKT-MTOR signaling pathway often develop a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders including epilepsy. A significant proportion of them remain unresponsive to conventional anti-seizure medications. Understanding mutation-specific pathophysiology is thus critical for molecularly targeted therapies. We previously determined that mouse models expressing patient-related activating mutation in PIK3CA are epileptic and acutely treatable with PI3K inhibition, irrespective of dysmorphology (Roy et al. 2015). Using the same mutant model, we have now identified physiological mechanisms underlying the dysregulated neuronal excitability and its acute attenuation. We show that Pik3ca-driven hyperexcitability in hippocampal pyramidal neurons is mediated by changes in multiple non-synaptic, cell-intrinsic properties. These are distinct from mechanisms driving epilepsy in TSC/RHEB models. Further, we report that acute inhibition of PI3K or AKT, but not MTOR, suppresses the intrinsic epileptiform nature of the mutant neurons. These data represent an important step towards precision therapeutics against intractable epilepsy, using pathway drugs originally developed as anti-cancer agents.",

    "abstract": "PurposeEwing sarcoma (EwS) is a highly aggressive bone- or soft tissue-associated malignancy mostly affecting children, adolescents, and young adults. Although multimodal therapies have strongly improved patients overall survival over the past decades, the development of prognostic biomarkers for risk-based patient stratification and more effective therapies with less adverse effects is stagnating. Thus, new personalized medicine approaches are urgently required.\n\nExperimental designGene expression data of EwS and normal tissues were crossed with survival data to identify highly overexpressed, prognostically relevant, and actionable potential targets. RNA-interference and dose-response assays as well as tissue-microarray analyses were carried out to explore the functional role and druggability of a prominent candidate gene in vitro and in vivo, and to validate its suitability as a prognostic biomarker.\n\nResultsEmploying a multilayered screening approach, we discover ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2) as a promising therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in EwS. Through analysis of two independent EwS patient cohorts, we show that RRM2 mRNA and protein overexpression is associated with an aggressive clinical phenotype and poor patients overall survival. In agreement, RRM2 silencing as well as pharmacological inhibition by the specific inhibitor triapine (3-AP) significantly reduces EwS growth in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we present evidence that pharmacological RRM2 inhibition by triapine can overcome chemoresistance against doxorubicin or gemcitabine, and synergize with cell cycle checkpoint inhibitors (CHEK1 or WEE1).\n\nConclusionsBased on the aggressive phenotype mediated by and the druggability of RRM2 our results provide a translational rationale for exploiting RRM2 as a novel therapeutic target in EwS and prompt further clinical investigations.",

    "abstract": "Visual perception of the environment is mediated by specialized photoreceptor (PR) neurons of the eye. Each PR expresses photosensitive opsins, which are activated by a particular wavelength of light. In most insects, the visual system comprises a pair of compound eyes that are mainly associated with motion detection, color or polarized light perception and a triplet of ocelli that are thought to be critical during flight to detect horizon and movements. It is widely believed that evolutionary diversification of compound eye and ocelli in insects occurred from an ancestral visual organ around 500 million years ago. Concurrently, opsin genes were also duplicated to provide distinct spectral sensitivities to different PRs of compound eye and ocelli. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, Rhodopsin1 (Rh1) and Rh2 are closely related opsins that are originated from the duplication of a single ancestral gene. However, in the visual organs, Rh2 is uniquely expressed in ocelli whereas Rh1 is uniquely expressed in outer PRs of the compound eye. It is currently unknown how this differential expression of Rh1 and Rh2 in the two visual organs is controlled to provide unique spectral sensitivities to ocelli and compound eyes. Here, we show that Homothorax (Hth) is expressed in ocelli and confers proper rhodopsin expression. We find that Hth controls a binary Rhodopsin switch in ocelli to promote Rh2 expression and repress Rh1 expression. Genetic and molecular analysis of rh1 and rh2 supports that Hth acts through their promoters to regulate Rhodopsin expression in the ocelli. Finally, we also show that when ectopically expressed in the retina, hth is sufficient to induce Rh2 expression only at the outer PRs in a cell autonomous manner. We therefore propose that the diversification of rhodpsins in the ocelli and retinal outer PRs occurred by duplication of an ancestral gene, which is under the control of Homothorax.",

Bacterial cultures are typically used to diagnose healthcare-acquired infections (HAI); however, culture-dependent methods provide limited presence/absence information and are not applicable to all pathogens. Next generation sequencing (NGS) has the capacity to detect a wide variety of pathogens, virulence elements, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) signatures in healthcare settings without the need for culturing, but few research studies have explored how NGS could be used to detect viable human pathogen transmission events under different HAI-relevant scenarios.\n\nMethodsThe objective of this project was to assess the capability of NGS-based methods to detect the direct and indirect transmission of high priority healthcare-related pathogens. DNA was extracted and sequenced from a previously published study exploring pathogen transfer with simulated skin containing background microorganisms, which allowed for complementary culture and metagenomic analysis comparisons. RNA was also isolated from an additional set of samples to evaluate metatranscriptomic analysis methods at different concentrations.\n\nResultsUsing various analysis methods and custom reference databases, both pathogenic and non-pathogenic members of the microbial community were taxonomically identified. Virulence and AMR genes known to reside within the community were also routinely detected. Ultimately, pathogen abundance within the overall microbial community played the largest role in successful taxonomic classification and gene identification.\n\nConclusionsThese results illustrate the utility of metagenomic analysis in clinical settings or for epidemiological studies, but also highlight the limits associated with the detection and characterization of pathogens at low abundance in a microbial community.",
