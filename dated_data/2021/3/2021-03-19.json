    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a debilitating non-motor symptom of Parkinsons disease (PD). The diagnosis of PD with cognitive impairment (PDCI) is essentially through clinical and neuropsychological examinations. There is an emerging need to identify biomarker(s) to foresee cognitive decline in PD patients, at an early stage. We performed label-free unbiased nontargeted proteomics (Q-TOF LC/MS-MS) in CSF of non-neurological control (NNC); PDCI; PD and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), followed by targeted ELISA for validation. The diagnosis was confirmed by neuropsychological and MRI assessments prior to CSF collection. Of the 282 proteins identified by mass spectrometry, 42 were differentially altered in PD, PDCI and NPH. Further, 28 proteins were altered in PDCI and 25 in NPH. An interesting overlap of certain proteins was noted both in PDCI and NPH. Five significantly upregulated proteins in PDCI were fibrinogen, gelsolin, complement factor-H, apolipoprotein A-IV and apolipoprotein A-I. Whereas carnosine dipeptidase 1, carboxypeptidase E, dickkpof 3 and secretogranin 3 precursor proteins were down-regulated. NPH also had few uniquely altered proteins viz. insulin-like growth factor-binding protein, ceruloplasmin, -1 antitrypsin, VGF nerve growth factor, neural cell adhesion molecule L1 like protein. Interestingly, the ELISA-derived protein concentrations correlated well with the neuropsychological scores of certain cognitive domains. Executive function was affected both in PDCI and NPH. In PD, Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST) percentile correlated positively with ApoA-IV and negatively with the ratio of ApoAI: ApoA-IV. Thus assessment of a battery of proteins like fibrinogen--chain, CFAH and ApoAI: ApoA-IV ratio alongside neuropsychological could be reliable biomarkers to distinguish PDCI and NPH.",

    "abstract": "This work employs Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease (APBD) models to explore the efficacy and mechanism of action of 144DG11, a new polyglucosan-reducing lead compound discovered by a high-throughput screen (HTS). APBD is an adult onset glycogen storage disorder (GSD) manifesting as a debilitating progressive axonopathic leukodystrophy. APBD is caused by glycogen branching enzyme (GBE) deficiency leading to poorly branched and insoluble glycogen inclusions, which precipitate as neuropathogenic polyglucosans (PG). 144DG11 led to prolonged survival and improved motor parameters in a GBE knockin (Gbeys/ys) APBD mouse model. Histopathologically, 144DG11 reduced PG and glycogen levels in brain, liver, heart, and peripheral nerve. Indirect calorimetry experiments revealed that 144DG11 increases carbohydrate burn at the expense of fat burn, suggesting metabolic mobilization of pathogenic PG. These results were also reflected at the cellular level by increased glycolytic, mitochondrial and total ATP production. Mechanistically, we show that the molecular target of 144DG11 is the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP1, whose interaction with the compound, similar to LAMP1 knockdown, enhanced autolysosomal degradation of glycogen and lysosomal acidification. Enhanced mitochondrial activity and lysosomal modifications were also the most pronounced effects of 144DG11 in APBD patient fibroblasts as discovered by image-based multiparametric phenotyping analysis and corroborated by proteomics. In summary, this work presents a broad mechanistic and target-based characterization of 144DG11 in in vivo and cell models of the prototypical GSD APBD. This investigation warrants development of 144DG11 into a safe and efficacious GSD therapy.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA new compound, demonstrated to ameliorate APBD in vivo and ex vivo by autophagic catabolism of glycogen, may potentially become a universal drug for glycogen storage disorders.",

    "abstract": "Large data initiatives and high-powered brain imaging analyses require the pooling of MR images acquired across multiple scanners, often using different protocols. Prospective cross-site harmonization often involves the use of a phantom or traveling subjects. However, as more datasets are becoming publicly available, there is a growing need for retrospective harmonization, pooling data from sites not originally coordinated together. Several retrospective harmonization techniques have shown promise in removing cross-site image variation. However, most unsupervised methods cannot distinguish between image-acquisition based variability and cross-site population variability, so they require that datasets contain subjects or patient groups with similar clinical or demographic information. To overcome this limitation, we consider cross-site MRI image harmonization as a style transfer problem rather than a domain transfer problem. Using a fully unsupervised deep-learning framework based on a generative adversarial network (GAN), we show that MR images can be harmonized by inserting the style information encoded from a reference image directly, without knowing their site/scanner labels a priori. We trained our model using data from five large-scale multi-site datasets with varied demographics. Results demonstrated that our styleencoding model can harmonize MR images, and match intensity profiles, successfully, without relying on traveling subjects. This model also avoids the need to control for clinical, diagnostic, or demographic information. Moreover, we further demonstrated that if we included diverse enough images into the training set, our method successfully harmonized MR images collected from unseen scanners and protocols, suggesting a promising novel tool for ongoing collaborative studies.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have argued that the m6A modification of mRNAs promotes mRNA recruitment to stress granules through the interaction with YTHDF proteins (Anders et al., 2018; Ries et al., 2019). However, mRNAs that contain multiple m6A modified sites partition similarly into stress granules in both wild-type and m6A-deficient cells by single-molecule FISH suggesting m6A modifications play a minor role in mRNA partitioning into stress granules. Moreover, multiple linear regression analysis suggests m6A modification plays a minimal role in stress granule recruitment. Finally, the artificial tethering of 25 YTHDF proteins on reporter mRNAs leads to only a modest increase in mRNA partitioning to stress granules. These results indicate m6A modification makes a small, but measurable, contribution to recruiting specific mRNAs to stress granules.",

    "abstract": "There are no reports of cancer in sponges, despite them having somatic cell turnover, long lifespans and no specialized adaptive immune cells. In order to investigate whether sponges are cancer resistant, we exposed a species of sponge, Tethya wilhelma, to X-rays. We found that T. wilhelma can withstand 600 Gy of X-ray radiation. That is approximately 100 times the lethal dose for humans. A single high dose of X-rays did not induce cancer in sponges, providing the first experimental evidence of cancer resistance in the phylum, Porifera. Following X-ray exposure, we found an overexpression of genes involved in DNA repair, signaling transduction pathways and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Sponges have the highest level of radiation resistance that has yet been observed in animals that have sustained somatic cell turnover. This may make them an excellent model system for studying cancer resistance and developing new approaches for cancer prevention and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Ground reaction forces (GRFs) are important for understanding human movement, but their measurement is generally limited to a laboratory. Previous studies used neural networks to predict GRF waveforms during running from wearable device data, but these predictions are limited to the stance phase of level-ground running. We sought to develop a recurrent neural network capable of predicting continuous normal (perpendicular to surface) GRFs across a range of running speeds and slopes from accelerometer data.\n\n19 subjects ran on a force-measuring treadmill at five slopes (0{degrees}, {+/-}5{degrees}, {+/-}10{degrees}) and three speeds (2.5, 3.33, 4.17 m/s) per slope with sacral- and shoe-mounted accelerometers. We then trained a recurrent neural network to predict normal GRF waveforms frame-by-frame. The predicted versus measured GRF waveforms had an average {+/-} SD RMSE of 0.16 {+/-} 0.04 BW and relative RMSE of 6.4 {+/-} 1.5% across all conditions and subjects.\n\nThe recurrent neural network predicted continuous normal GRF waveforms across a range of running speeds and slopes with greater accuracy than neural networks implemented in previous studies. This approach may facilitate predictions of biomechanical variables outside the laboratory in near real-time and improves the accurately of quantifying and monitoring external loads experienced by the body when running.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning cancer classification systems have the potential to improve cancer diagnosis. However, development of these computational approaches depends on prior annotation through a pathologist. This initial step relying on a manual, low-resolution, time-consuming process is highly variable and subject to observer variance. To address this issue, we developed a novel method, H&E Molecular neural network (HEMnet). This two-step process utilises immunohistochemistry as an initial molecular label for cancer cells on a H&E image and then we train a cancer classifier on the overlapping clinical histopathological images. Using this molecular transfer method, we show that HEMnet accurately distinguishes colorectal cancer from normal tissue at high resolution without the need for an initial manual histopathologic evaluation. Our validation study using histopathology images from TCGA samples accurately estimates tumour purity. Overall, our method provides a path towards a fully automated delineation of any type of tumor so long as there is a cancer-oriented molecular stain available for subsequent learning.

Host  omic profiles offer insights into the host response to infection and inflammation, with the interrogation of multiple  omic levels in parallel providing a more comprehensive picture. We used differential abundance analysis, pathway analysis, clustering and classification techniques to explore whether the host response in KD is more similar to the response to bacterial or viral infection at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels through comparison of  omic profiles from children with KD to those with bacterial and viral infections. Pathways activated in patients with KD included those involved in anti-viral and anti-bacterial responses. Unsupervised clustering showed that the majority of KD patients clustered with bacterial patients on both  omic levels, whilst application of diagnostic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infections revealed that many transcriptomic KD samples had low probabilities of having bacterial or viral infections, suggesting that KD may be triggered by a different process not typical of either common bacterial or viral infections. Clustering based on the transcriptomic and proteomic responses during KD revealed three clusters of KD patients on both  omic levels, suggesting heterogeneity within the inflammatory response during KD. The observed heterogeneity may reflect differences in the host response to a common trigger, or variation dependent on different triggers of the condition.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThis work presents a framework for deployment of deep learning image segmentation models for medical images across different operating systems and programming languages.\n\nMethodsComputational Environment for Radiological Research (CERR) platform was extended for deploying deep learning-based segmentation models to leverage CERRs existing functionality for radiological data import, transformation, management, and visualization. The framework is compatible with MATLAB as well as GNU Octave and Python for license-free use. Pre and post processing configurations including parameters for pre-processing images, population of channels, and post-processing segmentations was standardized using JSON format. CPU and GPU implementations of pre-trained deep learning segmentation models were packaged using Singularity containers for use in Linux and Conda environment archives for Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems. The framework accepts images in various formats including DICOM and CERRs planC and outputs segmentation in various formats including DICOM RTSTRUCT and planC objects. The ability to access the results readily in planC format enables visualization as well as radiomics and dosimetric analysis. The framework can be readily deployed in clinical software such as MIM via their extensions.\n\nResultsThe open-source, GPL copyrighted framework developed in this work has been successfully used to deploy Deep Learning based segmentation models for five in-house developed and published models. These models span various treatment sites (H&N, Lung and Prostate) and modalities (CT, MR). Documentation for their usage and demo workflow is provided at https://github.com/cerr/CERR/wiki/Auto-Segmentation-models. The framework has also been used in clinical workflow for segmenting images for treatment planning and for segmenting publicly available large datasets for outcomes studies.\n\nConclusionsThis work presented a comprehensive, open-source framework for deploying deep learning-based medical image segmentation models. The framework was used to translate the developed models to clinic as well as reproducible and consistent image segmentation across institutions, facilitating multi-institutional outcomes modeling studies.",

Conventional bleomycin models used to study pathogenic mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis display transient inflammation and fibrosis so their relevance to UIP is limited. We developed a novel chronic induced-UIP (iUIP) model, inducing fibrosis in D1CCxD1BC transgenic mice by intra-tracheal instillation of bleomycin mixed with microbubbles followed by sonoporation (BMS). A bimodal fibrotic lung disease was observed over 14 weeks, with an acute phase similar to nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), followed by partial remission and a chronic fibrotic phase with honeycombing similar to UIP. In this secondary phase, we observed poor vascularization despite elevated PDGFR{beta} expression. {gamma}2PF- and MMP7-positive epithelial cells, consistent with an invasive phenotype, were predominantly adjacent to fibrotic areas. Most invasive cells were Scgb1a1 and/or keratin 5 positive. This iUIP mouse model displays key features of IPF and has identified potential mechanisms contributing to the onset of NSIP and progression to UIP. The model will provide a useful tool for the assessment of therapeutic interventions to oppose acute and chronic fibrosis.\n\nSummary blurbA novel mouse model of induced-usual interstitial pneumonia shows bimodal fibrosis with honeycombing, similar to chronic lung disease seen with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Plants have evolved remarkable diversity in inflorescence architecture. At the center of this diversity lies a meristem maturation program featured by transition of stem cell populations from a vegetative state into a reproductive growth, determining when, where, and how many flowers are produced on inflorescences. Here we identified a new meristem maturation regulator TMF FAMILY MEMBER3 (TFAM3) that encodes an ALOG family transcription factor. Loss of TFAM3 results in early flowering and simplified inflorescences with fewer flowers. Genetic analysis by creating high-order mutants of TFAM3 with three key regulators of tomato shoot meristem maturation, TERMINATING FLOWER (TMF), TMF FAMILY MEMBER1 (TFAM1) and TMF FAMILY MEMBER2 (TFAM2), suggested that they synergistically control flowering transition and inflorescence architecture. The four paralogous ALOG proteins share the prion-like properties and undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro. Strikingly, TMF can recognize cognate TFAM proteins and selectively recruit them into phase separated condensates. Supporting this, they interact with themselves and each other to form biomolecular condensates in the nucleus. Their interaction induces formation of transcriptional condensates that directly repress expression of floral identity gene ANANTHA. Our study revealed a selective-recruitment phase separation mechanism for transcriptional condensation by which plants achieve optimal coordination of functional overlapped paralogs within a protein family to enable precise control of shoot meristem maturation for flowering and production of compound inflorescences.",

We critically evaluate the evidence for links between social cognition and eye pigmentation in primates, concluding that the cooperative eye hypothesis cannot convincingly explain the patterns observed. Although the human eye exhibits unique traits that are likely linked to social communication, high iridoscleral contrast is not one of them.

Iridoscleral contrasts in orangutans and gorillas approach the human condition but differ between congeneric species. Contrary to recent discussions, we found chimpanzee eyes to exhibit a cryptic coloration scheme that resembles gibbons more than other great apes and that does not enhance glance cueing or gaze following. We critically evaluate the evidence for links between social cognition and eye pigmentation in primates, concluding that the cooperative eye hypothesis cannot convincingly explain the patterns observed. Although the human eye exhibits unique traits that are likely linked to social communication, high iridoscleral contrast is not one of them. Differences in scleral pigmentation between great apes and humans are gradual and might have arisen via genetic drift and sexual selection.",

    "abstract": "When investigating connectivity and microstructure of white matter pathways of the brain using diffusion tractography bundle segmentation, it is important to understand potential confounds and sources of variation in the process. While cross-scanner and cross-protocol effects on diffusion microstructure measures are well described (in particular fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity), it is unknown how potential sources of variation effect bundle segmentation results, which features of the bundle are most affected, where variability occurs, nor how these sources of variation depend upon the method used to reconstruct and segment bundles. In this study, we investigate six potential sources of variation, or confounds, for bundle segmentation: variation (1) across scan repeats, (2) across scanners, (3) across vendors (4) across acquisition resolution, (5) across diffusion schemes, and (6) across diffusion sensitization. We employ four different bundle segmentation workflows on two benchmark multi-subject cross-scanner and cross-protocol databases, and investigate reproducibility and biases in volume overlap, shape geometry features of fiber pathways, and microstructure features within the pathways. We find that the effects of acquisition protocol, in particular acquisition resolution, result in the lowest reproducibility of tractography and largest variation of features, followed by vendor-effects, scanner-effects, and finally diffusion scheme and b-value effects which had similar reproducibility as scan-rescan variation. However, confounds varied both across pathways and across segmentation workflows, with some bundle segmentation workflows more (or less) robust to sources of variation. Despite variability, bundle dissection is consistently able to recover the same location of pathways in the deep white matter, with variation at the gray matter/ white matter interface. Next, we show that differences due to the choice of bundle segmentation workflows are larger than any other studied confound, with low-to-moderate overlap of the same intended pathway when segmented using different methods. Finally, quantifying microstructure features within a pathway, we show that tractography adds variability over-and-above that which exists due to noise, scanner effects, and acquisition effects. Overall, these confounds need to be considered when harmonizing diffusion datasets, interpreting or combining data across sites, and when attempting to understand the successes and limitations of different methodologies in the design and development of new tractography or bundle segmentation methods.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia have been conceived as partly opposing disorders in terms of systemizing versus empathizing cognitive styles, with resemblances to male versus female average sex differences. Left-right asymmetry of the brain is an important aspect of its organization that shows average differences between the sexes, and can be altered in both ASD and schizophrenia. Here we mapped multivariate associations of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for ASD and schizophrenia with asymmetries of regional cerebral cortical surface area, thickness and subcortical volume measures in 32,256 participants from the UK Biobank. PRS for the two disorders were positively correlated (r=0.08, p=7.13x10-50), and both were higher in females compared to males, consistent with biased participation against higher-risk males. Each PRS was associated with multivariate brain asymmetry after adjusting for sex, ASD PRS r=0.03, p=2.17x10-9, schizophrenia PRS r=0.04, p=2.61x10-11, but the multivariate patterns were mostly distinct for the two PRS, and neither resembled average sex differences. Annotation based on meta-analyzed functional imaging data showed that both PRS were associated with asymmetries of regions important for language and executive functions, consistent with behavioural associations that arose in phenome-wide association analysis. Overall, the results indicate that distinct patterns of subtly altered brain asymmetry may be functionally relevant manifestations of polygenic risk for ASD and schizophrenia, but do not support brain masculinization or feminization in their etiologies.",

There is emerging evidence that memorized items are represented rhythmically on the specific phase of the theta-band (4-7 Hz) neural oscillation. However, it is still unknown how this process impacts the accessibility to the active memory storage. Here we show that simply memorizing sequential information causes theta-band fluctuation in our behaviour (i.e., reaction time, RT). We measured RTs to a visual probe that appeared at sequentially memorized locations after a random interval. Consequently, RTs to the probes fluctuated in the theta range as a function of the random interval, and the behavioural rhythmicity supported the hypothesis of the phase-dependent coding of sequential working memory. The current results demonstrate that our behaviour fluctuates unconsciously in the theta-range when recalling sequential memory, suggesting that accessibility to sequential working memory is rhythmic rather than stable, possibly reflecting theta-phase dependent coding.",

    "abstract": "Dispersal plays a key role fostering recovery of endangered species because reoccupying a former range can only happen via dispersal. The northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) is a large, marine predator that was nearly exterminated in the 19th century by over-hunting. Once they were afforded protection from harvest, the species spread from a single remnant colony to reoccupy its former range. As colonies in central California were reestablished during the 1960s-1990s, tagged seals documented northward dispersal from southern California. The central California colonies are now large and well-established, and tagging programs at the four northernmost colonies allowed us to quantify the extent and direction of dispersal. Natal dispersal by females was highest from the southernmost colony at Piedras Blancas, where 61% of surviving females emigrated to breed. Dispersal from the other three colonies was much lower, 5.6% from SE Farallon Island, 10.3% from Ano Nuevo, and 16.6% from Point Reyes. Adult dispersal of females, after breeding, was rare, with an annual rate < 2%. Juvenile dispersal is thus frequent in elephant seals, highest northward but also occurring southward, suggesting that continued expansion to new colonies throughout the west coast is probable.",

    "abstract": "Mesic grasslands in South Africa (> 650 mm a-1 MAP) are rich in herbaceous forbs, which outnumber grass species by more than 5 to 1. Many of these forbs have underground storage units (USOs), such as thickened rootstocks, rhizomes, bulbs, or corms, that provide resources (non-structural carbohydrates, minerals, and water) enabling them to resprout after dry, frosty winters, and fire. However, despite their extensive biomass and reserves ostensibly protected underground, geophytic mesic grassland forbs can be severely depleted or extirpated by chronic trampling and grazing of their aerial parts by livestock. This study examined a possible explanation for forb demise in overgrazed grassland by investigating, in a pot trial, whether the growth of forbs and the size of their USOs are negatively affected by simulated green leaf loss. In a 2x2 factorial (clipped vs. unclipped x spring regrowth in the dark vs. light), five replicate plants of Hypoxis hemerocallidea, a common mesic grassland forb that resprouts from a corm, were subject to six severe (clipped to 80 mm) defoliations during the growing season and regrown in spring under full or restricted light to measure stored reserve contribution to regrowth. Defoliated plants were resilient to defoliation during the growing season, matching the total biomass production of unclipped plants, though cutting reduced the number of leaves by {not}60% and flowers by almost 85%. Spring regrowth on stored reserves equalled that from reserves plus concurrent photosynthesis, indicating the value of USOs for regrowth. However, there was a marked carry-over effect of previous season defoliation, resulting in a one-third reduction in shoot growth and 40% fewer inflorescence in spring. Crucially, corm mass was more than halved by clipping. Above-ground spring growth was linearly related to corm mass. It was concluded that buried stored reserves are not protected by recurrent disturbance to aerial plant parts and that continued diminishment of USOs under chronic disturbance by overgrazing or frequent mowing would weaken and likely eventually kill plants, reducing forb species richness. Lenient management by infrequent summer mowing or grazing at moderate stocking rates combined with periodic rotational full season resting and dormant-season burning is recommend to maintain the USOs and vigour of forbs in mesic grassland.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOcean microbes constitute [~]70% of the marine biomass, are responsible for [~]50% of the Earths primary production, and are crucial for global biogeochemical cycles. Marine microbiotas include core taxa that are usually key for ecosystem function. Despite their importance, core marine microbes are relatively unknown, which reflects the lack of consensus on how to identify them. So far, most core microbiotas have been defined based on species occurrence and abundance. Yet, species interactions are also important to identify core microbes, as communities include interacting species. Here, we investigate interconnected bacteria and small protists of the core pelagic microbiota populating a long-term marine-coastal observatory in the Mediterranean Sea over a decade.\n\nResultsCore microbes were defined as those present in >30% of the monthly samples over 10 years, with the strongest associations. The core microbiota included 259 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) including 182 bacteria, 77 protists, and 1,411 strong and mostly positive ([~]95%) associations. Core bacteria tended to be associated with other bacteria, while core protists tended to be associated with bacteria. The richness and abundance of core OTUs varied annually, decreasing in stratified warmers waters and increasing in colder mixed waters. Most core OTUs had a preference for one season, mostly winter, which featured subnetworks with the highest connectivity. Groups of highly associated taxa tended to include protists and bacteria with predominance in the same season, particularly winter. A group of 13 highly-connected hub-OTUs, with potentially important ecological roles dominated in winter and spring. Similarly, 18 connector OTUs with a low degree but high centrality were mostly associated with summer or autumn and may represent transitions between seasonal communities.\n\nConclusionsWe found a relatively small and dynamic interconnected core microbiota in a model temperate marine-coastal site, with potential interactions being more deterministic in winter than in other seasons. These core microbes would be essential for the functioning of this ecosystem over the year. Other non-core taxa may also carry out important functions but would be redundant and non-essential. Our work contributes to the understanding of the dynamics and potential interactions of core microbes possibly sustaining ocean ecosystem function.",

    "abstract": "Animal reproductive phenology varies from strongly seasonal to non-seasonal, sometimes among closely related or sympatric species. While the extent of reproductive seasonality is often attributed to environmental seasonality, this fails to explain many cases of non-seasonal breeding in seasonal environments. We investigated the evolutionary determinants of non-seasonal breeding in a wild primate, the chacma baboon (Papio ursinus), living in a seasonal environment with high climatic unpredictability. We tested three hypotheses proposing that non-seasonal breeding has evolved in response to (1) climatic unpredictability, (2) reproductive competition between females favouring birth asynchrony, and (3) individual, rank-dependent variations in optimal reproductive timing. We found strong support for an effect of reproductive asynchrony modulated by rank: (i) birth synchrony is costly to subordinate females, lengthening their interbirth intervals, and (ii) females delay their reproductive timings (fertility periods and conceptions) according to other females in the group to stagger conceptions. These results indicate that reproductive competition generates reproductive asynchrony, weakening the intensity of reproductive seasonality at the population level. This study emphasizes the importance of sociality in mediating the evolution of reproductive phenology in gregarious organisms, a result of broad significance for understanding key demographic parameters driving population responses to increasing climatic fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Bivalves are species-rich mollusks with prominent protective roles in coastal ecosystems. Across these ancient lineages, colony-founding larvae anchor themselves either by byssus production or by cemented attachment. The latter mode of sessile life is strongly molded by left-right shell asymmetry during larval development of Ostreoida oysters such as Crassostrea hongkongensis. Here, we sequenced the genome of C. hongkongensis in high resolution and compared it to reference bivalve genomes to unveil genomic determinants driving cemented attachment and shell asymmetry. Importantly, loss of the homeobox gene antennapedia (Antp) and broad expansion of lineage-specific extracellular gene families are implicated in a shift from byssal to cemented attachment in bivalves. Evidence from comparative transcriptomics shows that the left-right asymmetrical C. hongkongensis plausibly diverged from the symmetrical Pinctada fucata in expression profiles marked by elevated activities of orthologous transcription factors and lineage-specific shell-related gene families including tyrosinases, which may cooperatively govern asymmetrical shell formation in Ostreoida oysters.",

    "abstract": "The number of candidate molecules for new non-narcotic analgesics is extremely limited. Here we report the identification of thiowurtzine, a new potent analgesic molecule with promising application in chronic pain treatment. We describe the chemical synthesis of this unique compound derived from the hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20) explosive molecule. Then we use animal experiments to assess its analgesic activity in vivo upon chemical, thermal and mechanical exposures, compared to the effect of several reference drugs. Finally, we investigate the potential receptors of thiowurtzine in order to better understand its complex mechanism of action. We use docking, molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations to identify and characterize the potential targets of the drug and confirm the results of the animal experiments. Our findings finally indicate that thiowurtzine may have a complex mechanism of action, by targeting the mu, kappa, delta and ORL1 opioid receptors, and the voltage-gated calcium channels as well.",

    "abstract": "Cancers represent complex autonomous systems, displaying self-sufficiency in growth signaling. Autonomous growth is fueled by a cancer cells ability to  secrete-and-sense growth factors: a poorly understood phenomenon. Using an integrated systems and experimental approach, here we dissect the impact of a feedback-coupled GTPase circuit within the secretory pathway that imparts secretion-coupled autonomy. The circuit is assembled when the Ras-superfamily monomeric GTPase Arf1, and the heterotrimeric GTPase Gi{beta}{gamma} and their corresponding GAPs and GEFs are coupled by GIV/Girdin, a protein that is known to fuel aggressive traits in diverse cancers. One forward and two key negative feedback loops within the circuit create closed-loop control (CLC), allow the two GTPases to coregulate each other, and convert the expected switch-like behavior of Arf1-dependent secretion into an unexpected dose response alignment behavior of sensing and secretion. Such behavior translates into cell survival that is self-sustained by stimulus-proportionate secretion. Proteomic studies and protein-protein interaction network analyses pinpoint growth factors (e.g., the epidermal growth factor; EGF) as a key stimuli for such self-sustenance.

    "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction can offer unique insights into high dimensional microbiome dynamics by leveraging collective abundance fluctuations of multiple bacteria driven by similar ecological perturbations. However, methods providing lower-dimensional representations of microbiome dynamics both at the community and individual taxa level are not currently available. To that end, we present EMBED: Essential MicroBiomE Dynamics, a probabilistic non-linear tensor factorization approach. Similar to normal mode analysis in structural biophysics, EMBED infers ecological normal modes (ECNs), which represent the unique orthogonal modes capturing the collective behavior of microbial communities. A very small number of ECNs can accurately approximate microbiome dynamics across multiple data sets. Inferred ECNs reflect specific ecological behaviors, providing natural templates along which the dynamics of individual bacteria may be partitioned. Moreover, the multi-subject treatment in EMBED systematically identifies subject-specific and universal abundance dynamics that are not detected by traditional approaches. Collectively, these results highlight the utility of EMBED as a versatile dimensionality reduction tool for studies of microbiome dynamics.",

However, several studies utilizing P2rx7-/- mice did not observe impaired inflammation, on the contrary, these reports demonstrate that P2rx7-/- mice can have more sever inflammation compared to WT controls. To begin to clarify this discrepancy, the impact of P2X7R signaling on primary Th17 and Th1 cell responses was examined. Initially, utilizing a global knockout approach, we found that P2rx7-/- mice develop comparable Th17 and Th1 responses to those of WT mice. However, indepth in vitro and in vivo investigations revealed differences in the immune response outcome depending on which cell type expresses P2X7R. In this regard, DC-specific P2X7R deficient chimeras demonstrate a comparable Th17 differentiation pattern with that of WT chimeras but display a significantly enhanced Th1 response. However, P2rx7-/- T cells have a suppressed Th17 differentiation profile while developing a similarly enhanced Th1 response as observed in DC-specific P2X7R deficient chimeras. Finally, P2X7R expression induces more T cell death in vivo, attributed to its cytotoxicity, which results in a similar total number of WT Th17 and P2rx7-/- Th17 cells and remarkably higher amounts of P2rx7-/- Th1 cells. Collectively, our findings establish that P2X7R expression on CD4+ T cells is necessary for Th17 differentiation while inhibiting Th1 development.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota affects the physiology and metabolism of animals and its alteration can lead to diseases such as gut dysplasia or metabolic disorders. Several reports have shown that the immune system plays an important role in shaping both bacterial community composition and abundance in Drosophila, and that immune deficit, especially during aging, negatively affects microbiota richness and diversity. However, there has been little study at the effector level to demonstrate how immune pathways regulate the microbiota. A key set of Drosophila immune effectors are the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which confer defense upon systemic infection. AMPs and lysozymes, a group of digestive enzymes with antimicrobial properties, are expressed in the gut and are good candidates for microbiota regulation. Here, we take advantage of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the role of AMPs and lysozymes in regulation of gut microbiota structure and diversity.\n\nUsing flies lacking AMPs and newly generated lysozyme mutants, we colonized gnotobiotic flies with a defined set of commensal bacteria and analyzed changes in microbiota composition and abundance in vertical transmission and aging contexts through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Our study shows that AMPs and, to a lesser extent, lysozymes are necessary to regulate the total and relative abundance of bacteria in the gut microbiota. We also decouple the direct function of AMPs from the IMD signaling pathway that regulates AMPs but also many other processes, more narrowly defining the role of these effectors in the microbial dysbiosis observed in IMD-deficient flies upon aging.\n\nImportanceThis study advances current knowledge in the field of host-microbe interactions by demonstrating that the two families of immune effectors, antimicrobial peptides and lysozymes, actively regulate the gut microbiota composition and abundance. Consequences of the loss of these antimicrobial peptides and lysozymes are exacerbated during aging, and their loss contributes to increased microbiota abundance and shifted composition in old flies. This work shows that immune effectors, typically associated with resistance to pathogenic infections, also help shape the beneficial gut community, consistent with the idea that host-symbiont interactions use the same  language typically associated with pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGrapevine cultivars of the Pinot family represent clonally propagated mutants with major phenotypic and physiological differences, such as different colour or shifted ripening time, as well as changes in important viticultural traits. Specifically, the cultivars  Pinot Noir (PN) and  Pinot Noir Precoce (PNP, early ripening) flower at the same time, but vary in the beginning of berry ripening (veraison) and, consequently, harvest time. In addition to genotype, seasonal climatic conditions (i.e. high temperatures) also affect ripening times. To reveal possible regulatory genes that affect the timing of veraison onset, we investigated differences in gene expression profiles between PN and PNP throughout berry development with a closely meshed time series and over two separate years.\n\nResultsThe difference in the duration of berry formation between PN and PNP was quantified to be approximately two weeks under the growth conditions applied, using plant material with a proven PN and PNP clonal relationship. Clusters of co-expressed genes and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected which reflect the shift in the timing of veraison onset. Functional annotation of these DEGs fit to observed phenotypic and physiological changes during berry development. In total, we observed 3,342 DEGs in 2014 and 2,745 DEGs in 2017 between PN and PNP, with 1,923 DEGs across both years. Among these, 388 DEGs were identified as veraison-specific and 12 were considered as berry ripening time regulatory candidates. The expression profiles revealed two candidate genes for ripening time control which we designated VviRTIC1 and VviRTIC2 (VIT_210s0071g01145 and VIT_200s0366g00020, respectively). These genes likely contribute the phenotypic differences observed between PN and PNP.\n\nConclusionsMany of the 1,923 DEGs show highly similar expression profiles in both cultivars if the patterns are aligned according to developmental stage. In our work, putative genes differentially expressed between PNP and PN which could control ripening time as well as veraison-specific genes were identified. We point out connections of these genes to molecular events during berry development and discuss potential candidate genes which may control ripening time. Two of these candidates were observed to be differentially expressed in the early berry development phase. Several down-regulated genes during berry ripening are annotated as auxin response factors / ARFs. Conceivably, general changes in auxin signaling may cause the earlier ripening phenotype of PNP.",

We further assess whether these altered trophic interactions are visible on ecologically relevant scales. We observed clear patterns in agricultural constraints on microbial decomposition, which coincided with reduced invertebrate growth and an unexpected increase in invertebrate consumption of organic matter. Similar differences in invertebrate length depending on land use were observed in our field survey, thereby providing important clues on the relevance and vulnerability of interdependent processes that can serve to improve future forays in monitoring ecosystem health.",

    "abstract": "Large expanses of tropical rainforest have been converted into agricultural landscapes cultivated by smallholder farmers. This is also the case in north-eastern Madagascar; a region that retains significant proportions of forest cover despite slash-and-burn hill rice cultivation and vanilla agroforestry expansion. The region is also a global hotspot for herpetofauna diversity, but how amphibians and reptiles are affected by land-use change remains largely unknown. Using a space-for-time study design, we compared species diversity and community composition across seven prevalent land uses: unburned (old-growth forest, forest fragment, and forest-derived vanilla agroforest) and burned (fallow-derived vanilla agroforest, woody fallow, and herbaceous fallow) land-use types, and rice paddy. We conducted six comprehensive, time-standardized searches across at least ten replicates of each land-use type and applied genetic barcoding to confirm species identification. We documented an exceptional diversity of herpetofauna (119 species; 91% endemic). Plot-level amphibian species richness was significantly higher in old-growth forest than in all other land-use types. Plot-level reptile species richness was significantly higher in unburned land-use types compared to burned land-use types. For both amphibians and reptiles, the less-disturbed land-use types showed more uneven communities and the species composition in old-growth forest differed significantly from all other land-use types. Amphibians had higher forest dependency (38% of species occurred exclusively in old-growth forest) than reptiles (26%). Our analyses thus revealed that the two groups respond differently to land-use change: we found less pronounced losses of reptile species richness especially in unburned agricultural habitats, suggesting that reptiles are less susceptible to land-use change than amphibians, possibly due to their ability to cope with hotter and drier microclimates. Overall, old-growth forest harboured a unique diversity, but some species also thrived in vanilla agroforestry systems, especially if these were forest-derived. This highlights the importance of conserving old-growth forests and non-burned land-use types within agricultural landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell sequencing provides a new way to explore the evolutionary history of cells. Compared to traditional bulk sequencing, where a population of heterogeneous cells is pooled to form a single observation, single-cell sequencing isolates and amplifies genetic material from individual cells, thereby preserving the information about the origin of the sequences. However, single-cell data is more error-prone than bulk sequencing data due to the limited genomic material available per cell. Here, we present error and mutation models for evolutionary inference of single-cell data within a mature and extensible Bayesian framework, BEAST2. Our framework enables integration with biologically informative models such as relaxed molecular clocks and population dynamic models. Our simulations show that modeling errors increase the accuracy of relative divergence times and substitution parameters. We reconstruct the phylogenetic history of a colorectal cancer patient and a healthy patient from single-cell DNA sequencing data. We find that the estimated times of terminal splitting events are shifted forward in time compared to models which ignore errors. We observed that not accounting for errors can overestimate the phylogenetic diversity in single-cell DNA sequencing data. We estimate that 30-50% of the apparent diversity can be attributed to error. Our work enables a full Bayesian approach capable of accounting for errors in the data within the integrative Bayesian software framework BEAST2.",

    "abstract": "The genetic basis of traits can shape and constrain how adaptation proceeds in nature; rapid adaptation can be facilitated by polygenic traits, whereas polygenic traits may restrict re-use of the same genes in adaptation (genetic convergence). The rapidly evolving life histories of guppies in response to predation risk provide an opportunity to test this proposition. Guppies adapted to high- (HP) and low-predation (LP) environments in northern Trinidad evolve rapidly and convergently among natural populations. This system has been studied extensively at the phenotypic level, but little is known about the underlying genetic architecture. Here, we use an F2 QTL design to examine the genetic basis of seven (five female, two male) guppy life history phenotypes. We use RAD-sequencing data (16,539 SNPs) from 370 male and 267 female F2 individuals. We perform linkage mapping, estimates of genome-wide and per-chromosome heritability (multi-locus associations), and QTL mapping (single-locus associations). Our results are consistent with architectures of many-loci of small effect for male age and size at maturity and female interbrood period. Male trait associations are clustered on specific chromosomes, but female interbrood period exhibits a weak genome-wide signal suggesting a potentially highly polygenic component. Offspring weight and female size at maturity are also associated with a single significant QTL each. These results suggest rapid phenotypic evolution of guppies may be facilitated by polygenic trait architectures, but these may restrict gene-reuse across populations, in agreement with an absence of strong signatures of genetic convergence from recent population genomic analyses of wild HP-LP guppies.",

    "abstract": "Flowering pattern is a major taxonomic characteristic differentiating the two main subspecies of cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.). subsp. fastigiata possessing flowers on the mainstem (MSF) and a sequential flowering pattern, whereas subsp. hypogaea lacks flowers on the mainstem and exhibits an alternate flowering pattern. This character is considered the main contributor to plant architecture and the adaptability of each subgroup to specific growing conditions. Evidence indicates that flowering pattern differentiation occurred during the several thousand years of domestication and diversification in South America. However, the exact genetic mechanism that controls flowering pattern and the molecular changes that led to its historical diversification in peanut are unknown. We investigated the genetics of the flowering pattern in a recombinant inbred population of 259 lines (RILs), derivatives of an A. hypogaea and A. fastigiata cross. RILs segregated 1:1 in both the sequential/alternative and the MSF-plus/MSF-minus traits, indicating a single gene effect. Using the Axiom_Arachis2 SNP-array, MSF was mapped to a 1.7 Mbp segment on chromosome B02 of the cultivated A. hypogaea. Significant haplotype conservation was found for this locus in the USA peanut mini core collection, suggesting a possible selection upon hypogaea/fastigiata speciation. Furthermore, a candidate Terminal Flowering 1-like (AhTFL1) gene was identified within the MSF region, in which a 1492 bp deletion occurred in the fastigiata line that leads to a truncated protein product. Remapping MSF in the RIL population with the AhTFL1 deletion as a marker increased the LOD score from 53.3 to 158.8 with no recombination. The same deletion was also found to co-segregate with the phenotype in two EMS-mutagenized M2 families, suggesting a hotspot for large mutational deletion or gene conversion that may play a role in evolution. BLASTX analysis showed that the most similar homologous gene for TFL1-like in soybean is Det1, which previously was shown to control shoot determination. Sequence analysis of the TFL-1 in a series of domesticated lines showed that TFL1 was subjected to gain/loss events of the deletion, partly explaining the evolution of MSF in Arachis. Altogether, these results support the role of AhTFL-1 in peanut speciation during domestication and modern cultivation.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question appears in many bioinformatics applications: Does a sequencing read belong to a large dataset of genomes from some broad taxonomic group, even when the closest match in the set is evolutionarily divergent from the query? For example, low-coverage genome sequencing (skimming) projects either assemble the organelle genome or compute genomic distances directly from unassembled reads. Using unassembled reads needs contamination detection because samples often include reads from unintended groups of species. Similarly, assembling the organelle genome needs distinguishing organelle and nuclear reads. While k-mer-based methods have shown promise in read-matching, prior studies have shown that existing methods are insufficiently sensitive for contamination detection. Here, we introduce a new read-matching tool called CONSULT that tests whether k-mers from a query fall within a user-specified distance of the reference dataset using locality-sensitive hashing. Taking advantage of large memory machines available nowadays, CONSULT libraries accommodate tens of thousands of microbial species. Our results show that CONSULT has higher true-positive and lower false-positive rates of contamination detection than leading methods such as Kraken-II and improves distance calculation from genome skims. We also demonstrate that CONSULT can distinguish organelle reads from nuclear reads, leading to dramatic improvements in skims-based mitochondrial assemblies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRelation extraction is a fundamental task for extracting gene-disease associations from biomedical text. Existing tools have limited capacity, as they can extract gene-disease associations only from single sentences or abstract texts.\n\nResultsIn this work, we propose RENET2, a deep learning-based relation extraction method, which implements section filtering and ambiguous relations modeling to extract gene-disease associations from full-text articles. We designed a novel iterative training data expansion strategy to build an annotated full-text dataset to resolve the scarcity of labels on full-text articles. In our experiments, RENET2 achieved an F1-score of 72.13% for extracting gene-disease associations from an annotated full-text dataset, which was 27.22%, 30.30% and 29.24% higher than the best existing tools BeFree, DTMiner and BioBERT, respectively. We applied RENET2 to (1) ~1.89M full-text articles from PMC and found ~3.72M gene-disease associations; and (2) the LitCovid articles set and ranked the top 15 proteins associated with COVID-19, supported by recent articles.\n\nConclusionRENET2 is an efficient and accurate method for full-text gene-disease association extraction. The source-code, manually curated abstract/full-text training data, and results of RENET2 are available at https://github.com/sujunhao/RENET2.",

We here analyze the molecular targets of 41 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved KIs. We chose 18 drugs (Tyrosine KIs) and sought out to evaluate their selectivity profile and engagement with a number of targets in vivo at clinically relevant doses. We also wanted to see whether there prevails any correlation between the target engagement profile and the reported side effects for specific KIs chosen as test cases. To explore all clinical targets of the 18 KIs, we considered the free (unbound) maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of each KI and only chose targets for which the cognate affinities lie within the reported free Cmax values, thereby allowing plausible interaction in clinical doses. We retrieved the side effects of those KIs that is reported in the FDA adverse event reporting system. We illustrate how correlation analysis of target-side effect can give a new insight into the off target of KIs and their effect on increasing the toxicity of KIs. These analyses could aid our understanding of the structural-activity relationship of KIs.",

    "abstract": "From the drug discovery perspective, combination therapy is recommended in cancer due to efficiency and safety compared to the common cytotoxic and single-targeted monotherapies. However, identifying effective drug combinations is time- and cost-consuming. Here, we offer a novel strategy of predicting potential drug combinations and patient subclasses by constructing multipartite networks using drug response data on patient samples. In the present study, we used Beat AML and GDSC, two comprehensive datasets based on patient-derived and cell line-based samples, to show the potential of multipartite network modeling in cancer combinatorial therapy. We used the median values of cell viability to compare drug potency and reconstruct a weighted bipartite network, which models the interaction of drugs and biological samples. Then, clusters of network communities were identified in two projected networks based on the topological structure of networks. Chemical structures, drug-target networks, protein-protein interactions, and signaling networks were used to corroborate the intra-cluster homogeneity. We further leveraged the community structures within the drug-based multipartite networks to discover effective multi-targeted drug combinations, and the synergy levels which were supported with more evidence using the DrugComb and the ALMANAC databases. Furthermore, we confirmed the potency of selective combinations of drugs against monotherapy in vitro experiment using three acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Taken together, this study presents an innovative data-driven strategy based on multipartite networks to suggest potential drug combinations to improve treatment of AML.",

    "abstract": "Human and animal EEG data demonstrate that focal seizures start with low-voltage fast activity, evolve into rhythmic burst discharges and are followed by a period of suppressed background activity. This suggests that processes with dynamics in the range of tens of seconds govern focal seizure evolution. We investigate the processes associated with seizure dynamics by complementing the Hodgkin-Huxley mathematical model with the physical laws that dictate ion movement and maintain ionic gradients. Our biophysically realistic computational model closely replicates the electrographic pattern of a typical human focal seizure characterized by low voltage fast activity onset, tonic phase, clonic phase and postictal suppression. Our study demonstrates, for the first time in silico, the potential mechanism of seizure initiation by inhibitory interneurons via the initial build-up of extracellular K+ due to intense interneuronal spiking. The model also identifies ionic mechanisms that may underlie a key feature in seizure dynamics, i.e., progressive slowing down of ictal discharges towards the end of seizure. Our model prediction of specific scaling of inter-burst intervals is confirmed by seizure data recorded in the whole guinea pig brain in vitro and in humans, suggesting that the observed termination pattern may hold across different species. Our results emphasize ionic dynamics as elementary processes behind seizure generation and indicate targets for new therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Humans are able to adapt their locomotion to a variety of novel circumstances, for instance, walking on diverse terrain and walking with new footwear. During locomotor adaptation, humans have been shown to exhibit stereotypical changes in their movement patterns. Here, we provide a theoretical account of such locomotor adaptation, positing that the nervous system prioritizes stability in the short timescale and improves energy expenditure over a longer timescale. The resulting mathematical model has two processes: a stabilizing controller which is gradually changed by a reinforcement learner that exploits local gradients to lower energy expenditure, estimating gradients indirectly via intentional exploratory noise. We consider this model walking and adapting under three novel circumstances: walking on a split-belt treadmill (walking with each foot on a different belt, each belt at different speeds), walking with an exoskeleton, and walking with an asymmetric leg mass. This model predicts the short and long timescale changes observed in walking symmetry on the split-belt treadmill and while walking with the asymmetric mass. The model exhibits energy reductions with exoskeletal assistance, as well as entrainment to time-periodic assistance. We show that such exploration-based learning is degraded in the presence of large sensorimotor noise, providing a potential account for some impairments in learning.",

    "abstract": "Cigarette smoking and alcohol use are among the most prevalent substances used worldwide and account for a substantial proportion of preventable morbidity and mortality, underscoring the public health significance of understanding their etiology. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified genetic variants associated with cigarette smoking and alcohol use traits. However, the vast majority of risk variants reside in non-coding regions of the genome, and their target genes and neurobiological mechanisms are unknown. Chromosomal conformation mappings can address this knowledge gap by charting the interaction profiles of risk-associated regulatory variants with target genes. To investigate the functional impact of common variants associated with cigarette smoking and alcohol use traits, we applied Hi-C coupled MAGMA (H-MAGMA) built upon cortical and midbrain dopaminergic neuronal Hi-C datasets to GWAS summary statistics of nicotine dependence, cigarettes per day, problematic alcohol use, and drinks per week. The identified risk genes mapped to key pathways associated with cigarette smoking and alcohol use traits, including drug metabolic processes and neuronal apoptosis. Risk genes were highly expressed in cortical glutamatergic, midbrain dopaminergic, GABAergic, and serotonergic neurons, suggesting them as relevant cell types in understanding the mechanisms by which genetic risk factors influence cigarette smoking and alcohol use. Lastly, we identified pleiotropic genes between cigarette smoking and alcohol use traits under the assumption that they may reveal substance-agnostic, shared neurobiological mechanisms of addiction. The number of pleiotropic genes was [~]26-fold higher in dopaminergic neurons than in cortical neurons, emphasizing the critical role of ascending dopaminergic pathways in mediating general addiction phenotypes. Collectively, brain region- and neuronal subtype-specific 3D genome architecture refines neurobiological hypotheses for smoking, alcohol, and general addiction phenotypes by linking genetic risk factors to their target genes.",

    "abstract": "The forests of the Greater Mekong Subregion, consisting of Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, are under high pressure from economic development and exploitation of natural resources, including but not limited to land concession, smallholder plantations and commercial agriculture, agroforestry development, mining, and road infrastructure development. While these threats are well-known, the magnitude and dynamics of their individual and interacting effects on forest cover are not fully understood. This pilot study aims to apply existing, publicly available macro, micro, and socioeconomic data in addition to remote sensing forest cover data to explore economic determinants of deforestation in the Greater Mekong, using the case of the Central Annamites Landscape (CAL) ecoregion of Vietnam. A longitudinal panel was constructed for 2000-2017, containing 1,658 observations for 144 variables across 95 Tier 2 (district) administrative units in CAL from 2000-2017 for modeling macroeconomic and socioeconomic conditions against annual tree cover loss aggregated to the Tier 2 administrative unit. The first phase of the study used tiered spatial regression analysis to correlatively identify which commodities, economic development activities, and social conditions have historically had the greatest effect on forest cover by magnitude in CAL. Based on first phase results, we selected a subset of these determinants for scenario modelling to predict possible deforestation outcomes given certain economic scenarios. The results, among others, indicate that, when spatially collocated, high poverty rates and smaller scale agricultural land conversion are key immediate determinants of deforestation. This therefore provides evidence to support programs targeting rubber, acacia harvesting, artisanal mining, and land conversion for cash crop plantations. Education is also key immediate socioeconomic factor, as poverty rate is consistently associated with tree cover loss and increased educational attainment is consistently associated with reduced tree cover loss, at approximately 12 ha per percentage increase in secondary school graduation. On the macro level, economic growth in China and Vietnam are correlatively associated with tree cover loss, as are rising trade in Myanmar and Laos. This study provides a methodological contribution to the current academic literature identifying socioeconomic dimensions of deforestation through spatial econometric analysis and scenario modelling at the landscape level. For practitioner work, this pilot provides a model or tool for strategic planning of conservation interventions in light of economic conditions and factors.",

As a proof-of-principle, we applied scDALI to whole Drosophila embryos from F1 crosses, profiling sciATAC-seq at three embryonic stages. Even in these very complex samples, scDALI discovered hundreds of peaks with heterogeneous allelic imbalance, having effects in specific lineages and/or developmental stages. Our study provides a general strategy to identify the cellular context of allelic imbalance, a crucial step in linking genetic traits to cellular phenotypes.",

Using ConTraX, we analyzed >2,753 hiPSC-CMs over time under orthogonal experimental conditions in terms of culture media and substrate stiffnesses.

    "abstract": "Neuronal oscillations route external and internal information across brain regions. In the olfactory system, the two central nodes--the olfactory bulb (OB) and the piriform cortex (PC)--communicate with each other via neural oscillations to shape the olfactory percept. Communication between these nodes have been well characterized in non-human animals but less is known about their role in the human olfactory system. Using a recently developed and validated EEG-based method to extract signals from the OB and PC sources, we show in healthy human participants that there is a bottom-up information flow from the OB to the PC in the beta and gamma frequency bands, while top-down information from the PC to the OB is facilitated by delta and theta oscillations.

These data further our understanding of the critical role of bidirectional information flow in human sensory systems to produce perception.

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) play critical roles in stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we investigated TFs expressed in hemogenic endothelial (HE) progenitors differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and identified upregulated expression of SOXF factors SOX7, SOX17, and SOX18 in the HE population. To test whether overexpression of these factors increases HE differentiation efficiency, we established inducible hPSC lines and found only SOX17 improved differentiation. Temporal expression analysis further revealed SOX17 was turned on immediately before VE-Cadherin, indicating SOX17 may be a causative factor for HE differentiation. Upon SOX17 knockdown via CRISPR-Cas13d, HE differentiation was significantly abrogated. Strikingly, we discovered SOX17 overexpression alone is sufficient to generate more than 50% CD34+VE-cadherin+CD73- cells that could be directed to hematopoietic progenitors, which emerged via an endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition and significantly upregulated definitive hematopoietic transcriptional programs. Functional assays showed that these progenitors can differentiate into blood cells from multiple lineages. Our analyses reveal an uncharacterized function of SOX17 in directing hPSCs differentiation towards HE cells.\n\nSignificance StatementHemogenic endothelial (HE) cells have been generated from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to study blood development. However, their full transcriptomic characterization and key genes involving in directing HE differentiation is unclear. Utilizing single cell RNA-seq analysis, we find that SOX17 is solely expressed in HE cells and is also required for HE differentiation. Strikingly, we find that overexpression of SOX17 alone is sufficient to program hPSCs into CD34+VE-cadherin+CD73-HE cells, which could further differentiate into blood progenitors. Our research reveals that SOX17 is sufficient to direct hPSCs differentiation to HE cells.\n\nClassificationPhysical Sciences/Engineering; Biological Sciences/Cell Biology.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors opened a new horizon in cancer therapy by enabling durable and complete responses in patients, but their wider application against general solid cancers has been hampered by the lack of a broadly acting anti-cancer immune response initiating agents. Parthanatos is a previously unexplored immunogenic programmed necrosis mechanism that is triggered by the hyperactivation of PARP DNA repair and executed by an efficient DNA-fragmentation mechanism. We developed a proprietary macromolecular zinc complex agent C010DS-Zn that efficiently induced parthanatos against 4T1 murine cancer cells in vitro, which was characterized as PARP-mediated necrotic death with massive DNA damages. Ex vivo screening of its cytotoxicity against a panel of 53 low-passage human solid cancer PDX tumor fragments demonstrated its consistent delivery of characteristically DNA-damaging cell death that was unseen in the corresponding apoptosis positive controls. Further characterization of its in vivo treatment effects versus the immunosuppressive 4T1-Balb/c and immunogenic CT26-Balb/c syngeneic cancer models showed that sufficiently high intravenous C010DS-Zn treatments led to robust initiation of the tumor-suppressed antitumor immune compartments such as T cells and macrophages. At lower non-anticancer doses, C010DS-Zn treatment still led to significantly reduced macrophage content and inflammation in the 4T1 tumor, suggesting its potential utility against macrophage-mediated inflammations such as those seen in MIS-C or COVID19. Given the observation of its low serum bioavailability in a rat pharmacokinetic study, these results suggest potential development opportunities for C010DS-Zn to become a widely applicable immune initiation agent with chemo-like broad applicability upon its pharmacokinetic improvements.",

Functional analysis in Xenopus laevis oocytes was performed for all KCNH2 variants identified.\n\nResultsKCNH2 variants were found in 11.1% (10/90) of SUDEP individuals compared to 6.0% (20/332) of epilepsy controls (p = 0.11). Loss-of-function KCNH2 variants, defined as causing > 20% reduction in maximal amplitude, were observed in 8.9% (8/90) SUDEP patients compared to 3.3% (11/332) epilepsy controls suggesting about three-fold enrichment (nominal p = 0.04). KCNH2 variants that did not change channel function occurred at a similar frequency in SUDEP (2.2%; 2/90) and epilepsy control (2.7%; 9/332) cohorts (p > 0.99). Rare KCNH2 variants (< 1% allele frequency) associated with greater loss of function and an [~]11-fold enrichment in the SUDEP cohort (nominal p = 0.03). In silico tools were unable to predict the impact of a variant on function highlighting the need for electrophysiological analysis.\n\nConclusionsThese data show that loss-of-function KCNH2 variants are enriched in SUDEP patients and suggest that cardiac mechanisms contribute to SUDEP risk. We propose that genetic screening in combination with functional analysis can identify loss-of-function KCNH2 variants that could act as biomarkers of an individuals SUDEP risk.",

Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in the defense against viral infections, for instance plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), have the capacity to produce vast amounts of interferon-alpha (IFN-). In COVID-19 there is a deficit in DC numbers and IFN- production, which has been associated with disease severity. In this work, we described that in addition to the DC deficiency, several DC activation and homing markers were altered in acute COVID-19 patients, which were associated with multiple inflammatory markers. Remarkably, previously hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients remained with decreased numbers of CD1c+ myeloid DCs and pDCs seven months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the expression of DC markers as CD86 and CD4 were only restored in previously non-hospitalized patients while integrin {beta}7 and indoleamine 2,3- dyoxigenase (IDO) no restoration was observed.

    "abstract": "Hyperimmune immunoglobulin (hCoV-2IG) preparations generated from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma (CP) are under evaluation in several clinical trials of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Here we explored the antibody epitope repertoire, antibody binding and virus neutralizing capacity of six hCoV-2IG batches as well as nine convalescent plasma (CP) lots against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants of concern (VOC). The Gene-Fragment Phage display library spanning the SARS-CoV-2 spike demonstrated broad recognition of multiple antigenic sites spanning the entire spike including NTD, RBD, S1/S2 cleavage site, S2-fusion peptide and S2-heptad repeat regions. Antibody binding to the immunodominant epitopes was higher for hCoV-2IG than CP, with predominant binding to the fusion peptide. In the pseudovirus neutralization assay (PsVNA) and in the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 PRNT assay, hCoV-2IG lots showed higher titers against the WA-1 strain compared with CP. Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs from around the globe were reduced to different levels by hCoV-2IG lots. The most significant loss of neutralizing activity was seen against the B.1.351 (9-fold) followed by P.1 (3.5-fold), with minimal loss of activity against the B.1.17 and B.1.429 ([&le;]2-fold). Again, the CP showed more pronounced loss of cross-neutralization against the VOCs compared with hCoV-2IG. Significant reduction of hCoV-2IG binding was observed to the RBD-E484K followed by RBD-N501Y and minimal loss of binding to RBD-K417N compared with unmutated RBD. This study suggests that post-exposure treatment with hCoV-2IG is preferable to CP. In countries with co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, identifying the infecting virus strain could inform optimal treatments, but would likely require administration of higher volumes or repeated infusions of hCOV-2IG or CP, in patients infected with the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

Despite its essential function and the existence of structural and biochemical data on ArlH, the role of ArlH in archaellum assembly and function remains elusive. ArlH is a structural homolog of KaiC, the central component of the cyanobacterial circadian clock. Similar to KaiC, ArlH exhibits autophosphorylation activity, which was observed for both ArlH of the euryarchaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (PfArlH) and the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (SaArlH). Using a combination of single molecule fluorescence measurements and biochemical assays, it is shown that autophosphorylation of ArlH is closely linked to the oligomeric state of ArlH bound to ArlI. These experiments also strongly suggest that ArlH is a hexamer in its functional ArlI bound state. Mutagenesis of the putative catalytic residue Glu-57 in SaArlH results in a reduced autophosphorylation activity and abolished archaellation and motility, suggesting that optimum phosphorylation activity of ArlH is essential for both archaellation and motility.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis B Virus constitutes a major threat to global public health. Current understanding of HBV-host interaction is yet limited. Here, ribosome profiling, quantitative mass spectrometry and RNA-sequencing are conducted on a recently established HBV replication system. We have identified multiomic DEGs (differentially expressed genes) that HBV orchestrated to remodel host proteostasis networks. Our multiomics interrogation revealed that HBV induced significant changes in both transcription and translation of 35 canonical genes including PPP1R15A, PGAM5 and SIRT6, as well as the expression of at least 15 non-canonical ORFs including ncPON2 and ncGRWD1, thus revealing an extra coding potential of human genome. Overexpression of these five genes but not the enzymatically deficient SIRT6 mutants suppressed HBV replication while knockdown SIRT6 had opposite effect. Furthermore, the expression of SIRT6 was down-regulated in patients, cells or animal models of HBV infection. Mechanistic study further indicated that SIRT6 directly binds to mini-chromosome and deacetylates histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac) and histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56ac), and chemical activation of endogenous SIRT6 with MDL800 suppressed HBV infection in vitro and in vivo. By generating the first multiomics landscape of host-HBV interaction, our work is thus opening a new avenue to facilitate therapeutic development against HBV infection.",

    "abstract": "Small proteins are critically involved in the acclimation response of photosynthetic cyanobacteria to nitrogen starvation. NblD is the 66-amino-acid effector of nitrogen-limitation-induced phycobilisome breakdown, which is believed to replenish the cellular amino acid pools. To address the physiological functions of NblD, the concentrations of amino acids, intermediates of the arginine catabolism pathway and several organic acids were measured during the response to nitrogen starvation in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 wild type and in an nblD deletion strain. A characteristic signature of metabolite pool composition was identified, which shows that NblD-mediated phycobilisome degradation is required to maintain the cellular amino acid and organic acid pools during nitrogen starvation. Specific deviations from the wild type suggest wider-reaching effects that also affect such processes as redox homeostasis via glutathione and tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, both of which are linked to the strongly decreased glutamate pool, and transcriptional reprogramming via an enhanced concentration of 2-oxoglutarate, the metabolite co-regulator of the NtcA transcription factor. The essential role played by NblD in metabolic homeostasis is consistent with the widespread occurrence of NblD throughout the cyanobacterial radiation and the previously observed strong positive selection for the nblD gene under fluctuating nitrogen supply.\n\nImportanceCyanobacteria play important roles in the global carbon and nitrogen cycles. In their natural environment, these organisms are exposed to fluctuating nutrient conditions. Nitrogen starvation induces a coordinated nitrogen-saving program that includes the breakdown of nitrogen-rich photosynthetic pigments, particularly phycobiliproteins. The small protein NblD was recently identified as an effector of phycobilisome breakdown in cyanobacteria. In this study, we demonstrate that the NblD-mediated degradation of phycobiliproteins is needed to sustain cellular pools of soluble amino acids and other crucial metabolites. The essential role played by NblD in metabolic homeostasis explains why genes encoding this small protein are conserved in almost all members of cyanobacterial radiation.",

    "abstract": "Rapid repurposing of existing drugs as new therapeutics for COVID-19 has been an important strategy in the management of disease severity during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Here, we used high-throughput docking to screen 6000 compounds within the DrugBank library for their potential to bind and inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 3CL main protease, a chymotrypsin-like enzyme that is essential for viral replication. For 19 candidate hits, parallel in vitro fluorescence-based protease-inhibition assays and Vero-CCL81 cell-based SARS-CoV-2 replication-inhibition assays were performed. One hit, diclazuril (an investigational anti-protozoal compound), was validated as a SARS-CoV-2 3CL main protease inhibitor in vitro (IC50 value of 29 {micro}M) and modestly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero-CCL81 cells. Another hit, lenvatinib (approved for use in humans as an anti-cancer treatment), could not be validated as a SARS-CoV-2 3CL main protease inhibitor in vitro, but serendipitously exhibited a striking functional synergy with the approved nucleoside analogue remdesivir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, albeit this was specific to Vero-CCL81 cells. Lenvatinib is a broadly-acting host receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor, but the synergistic effect with remdesivir was not observed with other approved RTK inhibitors (such as pazopanib or sunitinib), suggesting that the mechanism-of-action is independent of host RTKs. Furthermore, time-of-addition studies revealed that lenvatinib/remdesivir synergy probably targets SARS-CoV-2 replication subsequent to host-cell entry. Our work shows that combining computational and cellular screening is a means to identify existing drugs with repurposing potential as antiviral compounds. Future studies could be aimed at understanding and optimizing the lenvatinib/remdesivir synergistic mechanism as a therapeutic option.",

We determined in vivo target affinity KD of 115 miRNAs by integrating activity measurements, CRISPR/Cas miRNA knockouts and miRNA sequencing. Target affinities of individual miRNAs spanned several orders of magnitude, with highly expressed miRNAs having overall higher KD. Scaling miRNA expression levels by their respective KD recapitulated the relative number of Argonaute-bound targets for individual miRNA families.

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters host cells when the viral spike protein is cleaved by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) after binding to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Since ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the mucosa of the tongue and gingiva, the oral cavity seems like it is an entry point for SARS-CoV-2. Daily oral care using mouthwash seems to play an important role in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the relationship between daily oral care and the mechanisms of virus entry into host cells is unclear. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of ingredients that are generally contained in toothpaste and mouthwash on the interaction between the spike protein and ACE2 and on the serine protease activity of TMPRSS2 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and in vitro enzyme assay, respectively. Both assays detected inhibitory effects of sodium tetradecene sulfonate, sodium N-lauroyl-N-methyltaurate, sodium N-lauroylsarcosinate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and copper gluconate. Molecular docking simulations suggested that these ingredients could bind to the inhibitor-binding site of ACE2. In addition, tranexamic acid and 6-aminohexanoic acid, which act as serine protease inhibitors, exerted inhibitory effects on TMPRSS2 protease activity. Further experimental and clinical studies are needed to further elucidate these mechanisms. Our findings support the possibility that toothpaste and mouthwash contain ingredients that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "The zebrafish has become a widely used animal model due in large part to its accessibility to and usefulness for high-resolution optical imaging. Although zebrafish research has historically focused mostly on early development, in recent years the fish has increasingly been used to study regeneration, cancer metastasis, behavior, and other processes taking place in juvenile and adult animals. However, imaging of live adult zebrafish is extremely challenging, with survival of adult fish limited to a few tens of minutes using standard imaging methods developed for zebrafish embryos and larvae. Here, we describe a new method for imaging intubated adult zebrafish using a specially designed 3D printed chamber for long-term imaging of adult zebrafish on inverted microscope systems. We demonstrate the utility of this new system by nearly day-long observation of neutrophil recruitment to a wound area in living double-transgenic adult casper zebrafish with fluorescently labeled neutrophils and lymphatic vessels.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization is rapidly transforming much of Southeast Asia, altering the structure and function of the landscape, as well as the frequency and intensity of the interactions between people, animals, and the environment. In this study, we began to explore the impact of urbanization on zoonotic disease risk by simultaneously characterizing changes in the abundance and diversity of reservoir hosts (rodents), ectoparasite vectors (ticks), and microbial pathogens across a gradient of urbanization in Malaysian Borneo. We found that although rodent species diversity decreased with increasing urbanization, two species appeared to thrive in anthropogenic environments: the invasive urban exploiter, Rattus rattus and the native urban adapter, Sundamys muelleri. R. rattus was strongly associated with the presence of built infrastructure across the gradient and dominated the urban rodent community where it was associated with high microbial diversity and multi-host zoonoses capable of environmental transmission, including Leptospira spp., and Toxoplasma gondii. In contrast, S. muelleri was restricted to sites with a significant vegetative component where it was found at high densities in the urban location. This species was strongly associated with the presence of ticks, including the medically important genera Ambylomma, Haemaphysalis, and Ixodes. Overall, our results demonstrate that the response to urbanization varies by species at all levels: host, ectoparasite, and microbe. This may lead to increased zoonotic disease risk in a subset of environments across urban and urbanizing landscapes that can be reduced through improved pest management and public health messaging.",

    "abstract": "Plastic recombination in Drosophila melanogaster has been associated with a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic factors such as temperature, starvation, and parasite infection. The bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis has also been associated with plastic recombination in D. melanogaster. Wolbachia infection is pervasive in arthropods and this infection induces a variety of phenotypes in its hosts, the strength of which can depend on bacterial concentration, or titer. Here we test the hypothesis that the magnitude of Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination in D. melanogaster depends on titer. To manipulate titer, we raised Wolbachia-infected and uninfected flies on diets that have previously been shown to increase or decrease Wolbachia titer relative to controls. We measured recombination in treated and control individuals using a standard backcrossing scheme with two X-linked visible markers. Our results recapitulate previous findings that Wolbachia infection is associated with increased recombination rate across the yellow-vermillion interval of the X chromosome. Our data show no significant effect of diet or diet by Wolbachia interactions on recombination, suggesting that diet-induced changes in Wolbachia titer have no effect on the magnitude of plastic recombination. These findings represent the first step toward investigating the mechanisms behind Wolbachia-associated plastic recombination and demonstrate that the effect may be threshold-based as opposed to dose-dependent.",

    "abstract": "A central goal of evolutionary genetics is to understand, at the molecular level, how organisms adapt to their environments. For a given trait, the answer often involves the acquisition of variants at unlinked sites across the genome. Genomic methods have achieved landmark successes in pinpointing adaptive loci. To figure out how a suite of adaptive alleles work together, and to what extent they can reconstitute the phenotype of interest, requires their transfer into an exogenous background. We studied the joint effect of adaptive, gain-of-function thermotolerance alleles at eight unlinked genes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, when introduced into a thermosensitive sister species, S. paradoxus. Although the loci damped each others beneficial impact (that is, they were subject to negative epistasis), most boosted high-temperature growth alone and in combination, and none was deleterious. The complete set of eight genes was sufficient to confer [~]15% of the S. cerevisiae phenotype in the S. paradoxus background. The same loci also contributed to a heretofore unknown advantage in cold growth by S. paradoxus. Together, our data establish temperature resistance in yeasts as a model case of a genetically complex evolutionary tradeoff, which can be partly reconstituted from the sequential assembly of unlinked underlying loci.\n\nAuthor summaryOrganisms adapt to threats in the environment by acquiring DNA sequence variants that tweak traits to improve fitness. Experimental studies of this process have proven to be a particular challenge when they involve manipulation of a suite of genes, all on different chromosomes. We set out to understand how so many loci could work together to confer a trait. We used as a model system eight genes that govern the ability of the unicellular yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to grow at high temperature. We introduced these variant loci stepwise into a non-thermotolerant sister species, and found that the more S. cerevisiae alleles we added, the better the phenotype. We saw no evidence for toxic interactions between the genes as they were combined. We also used the eight-fold transgenic to dissect the biological mechanism of thermotolerance. And we discovered a tradeoff: the same alleles that boosted growth at high temperature eroded the organisms ability to deal with cold conditions. These results serve as a case study of modular construction of a trait from nature, by assembling the genes together in one genome.",

Yet the mechanisms by which specific TFs and RBPs function together in context-specific ways to drive precise co-transcriptional splicing at each of thousands of genomic loci remains unknown. Therefore, we have used sex-specific splicing in Drosophila as a model to understand how the function of TFs and RBPs is coordinated to transcribe and process specific RNA transcripts at the correct genomic locations. We show widespread sex-specific transcript diversity occurs much earlier than previously thought and present a new pipeline called time2splice to quantify splicing changes over time. We define several mechanisms by which the essential and functionally-conserved CLAMP TF functions with specific RBPs to precisely regulate co-transcriptional splicing: 1) CLAMP links the DNA of gene bodies of sex-specifically spliced genes directly to the RNA of target genes and physically interacts with snRNA and protein components of the splicing machinery; 2) In males, CLAMP regulates the distribution of the highly conserved RBP Maleless (MLE) (RNA Helicase A) to prevent aberrant sex-specific splicing; 3) In females, CLAMP modulates alternative splicing by directly binding to target DNA and RNA and indirectly through regulating the splicing of sex lethal, the master regulator of sex determination. Overall, we provide new insight into how TFs function specifically with RBPs to drive alternative splicing.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNA miR-181a is down-regulated in the kidneys of hypertensive patients and hypertensive mice. In vitro, miR-181a is a posttranslational inhibitor of renin expression, but pleiotropic mechanisms by which miR-181a may influence blood pressure (BP) are unknown. Here we determined whether deletion of miR-181a/b-1 in vivo changes BP and the molecular mechanisms involved at the single-cell level. We developed a knockout mouse model lacking miR-181a/b-1 genes using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Radio-telemetry probes were implanted in twelve-week-old C57BL/6J wild-type and miR-181a/b-1 knockout mice. Systolic and diastolic BP were 4-5mmHg higher in knockout compared with wild-type mice over 24-hours (P<0.01). Compared with wild-type mice, renal renin was higher in the juxtaglomerular cells of knockout mice. BP was similar in wild-type mice on a high (3.1%) versus low (0.3%) sodium diet (+0.4{+/-}0.8mmHg) but knockout mice showed salt sensitivity (+3.3{+/-}0.8mmHg, P<0.001). Since microRNAs can target several mRNAs simultaneously, we performed single-nuclei RNA-sequencing in 6,699 renal cells. We identified 12 distinct types of renal cells, all of which had genes that were dysregulated. This included genes involved in renal fibrosis and inflammation such as Stat4, Col4a1, Cd81, Flt3l, Cxcl16, Smad4. We observed up-regulation of pathways related to the immune system, inflammatory response, reactive oxygen species and nerve development, consistent with higher tyrosine hydroxylase. In conclusion, downregulation of the miR-181a gene led to increased BP and salt sensitivity in mice. This is likely due to an increase in renin expression in juxtaglomerular cells, as well as microRNA-driven pleiotropic effects impacting renal pathways associated with hypertension.",

Whilst bacteria such as E. coli have relatively simple membranes when compared to eukaryotic cells, there is ample evidence that many bacterial proteins bind to specific lipids, especially the anionic lipid cardiolipin. Here, we apply molecular dynamics simulations to assess lipid binding to 42 different E. coli inner membrane proteins. Our data reveals a strong asymmetry between the membrane leaflets, with a marked increase of anionic lipid binding to the inner leaflet regions of membrane proteins, particularly for cardiolipin. From our simulations we identify over 700 independent cardiolipin binding sites, allowing us to identify the molecular basis of a prototypical cardiolipin binding site, which we validate against structures of bacterial proteins bound to cardiolipin. This allows us to construct a set of metrics for defining a high affinity cardiolipin binding site on (bacterial) membrane proteins, paving the way for a heuristic approach to defining more complex protein-lipid interactions.",

    "abstract": "Viticulture is one of the briskest economic activities worldwide. A major obstacle impeding such grape yields to satisfy the demand for increased production is the insufficient period of chilling temperatures which, due to climate change, is becoming briefer. The shorter period of cold leads to poor budbreak which, in turn, results in reduced yields. To combat this issue, agronomists have resorted to treatments with chemical regulators to meet the chilling requirement for bud dormancy release several fruit-bearing plants have, including grapevines.\n\nThis study aimed at identifying and quantifying during eco-dormancy the individual polyphenolic compounds, and their possible variations, in the latent buds of the  Prime(C) and  Ralli table grape cultivars. The study induced chemical stress by means of four different solutions, at three discrete dates per year, for three consecutive years. Phenolics in the latent buds of the studied varieties were analyzed via HPLC. Their quantitative analysis showed variations both between the varieties and between the samples of those varieties collected after the eight treatments. The analysis indicated that the concentration of phenolics continued progressing during the annual growth cycle of the grapevine, with strong positive correlations being detected between catechin, epicatechin, chlorogenic acid, o-coumaric, piceid, procyanidins B1-B2, rutin, {varepsilon}-viniferin. Luteolin registered a positive correlation with quercetin, resveratrol, o-coumaric, but not with the remaining polyphenols. The results confirmed that (a) the concentration of phenolics of the latent buds is affected by chemically-induced stress conditions, (b) depending on the date of application, significant changes appear in the variations of those phenolics.\n\nOne sentence summaryChanges in the levels of polyphenol compounds of the grapevines latent buds hints, for the first time, how much stress the buds actually undergo under chemically-induced stress conditions",

    "abstract": "Accurately phenotyping numerous test subjects is essential for most experimental research. Collecting such data can be tedious or time-consuming, and can be biased or limited by manual observations. The thermal tolerance of small ectotherms is a good example of this type of phenotypic data, and it is widely used to investigate thermal adaptation, acclimation capacity and climate change resilience of small ectotherms. Here, we present the results of automatically generated thermal tolerance data using motion tracking on video recordings using two Drosophila species and temperature acclimation to create variation in thermal tolerances and two different heat tolerance assays. We find similar effect sizes of acclimation and hardening responses between manual and automated approaches, but different absolute tolerance estimates. This discrepancy likely reflects both technical differences and the behavioral cessation of movement rather than physiological failure measured in other assays. We conclude that both methods generate biological meaningful results, which reflect different aspects of the thermal biology, find no evidence of inflated variance in the manually scored assays, but find that automation can increase throughput without compromising quality. Further we show that the method can be applied to a wide range of arthropod taxa. We suggest that our automated method is a useful example of through-put phenotyping, and suggest this approach might be applied to other tedious laboratory traits, such as desiccation or starvation tolerance, with similar benefits to through-put. However, the interpretation and potential comparison to results using different methodology rely on thorough validation of the assay and the involved biological mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Fibrotic lesions accompany several pathological conditions including tumors. We show that expression of a dominant-active form of the Ras oncogene in Drosophila salivary glands (SGs) leads to redistribution of components of the basement membrane (BM) and fibrotic lesions. Similar to several types of mammalian fibrosis, the disturbed BM attracts clot components including insect transglutaminase and phenoloxidase. SG epithelial cells show reduced apico-basal polarity accompanied by a loss of secretory activity. Both the fibrotic lesions and the reduced cell polarity are alleviated by ectopic expression of the antimicrobial peptide Drosomycin (Drs), which also restores secretory activity of the SGs. In addition to ECM components, both Drs and F-actin localize to fibrotic lesions.",

    "abstract": "Prevotella copri is a prevalent inhabitant of the human gut and has been associated with plant-rich diet consumption and diverse health states. The underlying genetic basis of these associations remains enigmatic due to the lack of genetic tools. Here, we developed a novel versatile genetic toolbox for rapid and efficient genetic insertion and allelic exchange applicable to P. copri strains from multiple clades. Enabled by the genetic platform, we systematically investigated the specificity of polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs), and identified four highly conserved PULs for utilizing arabinan, pectic galactan, arabinoxylan and inulin, respectively. Further genetic and functional analysis of arabinan utilization systems illustrate that P. copri has evolved two distinct types of arabinan-processing PULs (PULAra) and that the type-II PULAra is significantly enriched in individuals consuming a vegan diet compared to other diets. In summary, this genetic toolbox will enable functional genetic studies for P. copri in the future.",

    "abstract": "Pistachios have been implicated in two salmonellosis outbreaks and multiple recalls in the U.S. This study performed a retrospective data analysis of Salmonella associated with pistachios and a storage study to evaluate the survivability of Salmonella on inoculated inshell pistachios to further understand the genetics and microbiological dynamics of this commodity-pathogen pair. The retrospective data analysis on isolates associated with pistachios was performed from both short-read and long-read sequencing technologies. The sequence data were analyzed using the FDAs Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis and Whole Genome Multi-locus Sequence Typing (wgMLST) pipeline. The storage study evaluated the survival of five strains of Salmonella on pistachios, both in a cocktail as well as individually. Our results demonstrate: i) evidence of persistent Salmonella Senftenberg and Salmonella Montevideo strains in pistachio environments, some of which may be due to clonal resident strains and some of which may be due to preharvest contamination; ii) presence of the Copper Homeostasis and Silver Resistance Island (CHASRI) in Salmonella Senftenberg and Montevideo strains in the pistachio supply chain; and iii) different serovars of Salmonella enterica, including Salmonella Senftenberg and Salmonella Montevideo, are able to survive in pistachios over an extended period of time.\n\nImportancePistachios have been linked to multistate outbreaks caused by Salmonella serovar Senftenberg (2013, 2016) and serovar Montevideo (2016). This comprehensive study of whole-genome-sequence (WGS) data from Senftenberg and Montevideo isolates associated with pistachio outbreaks, recalls, and investigations over a nine-year period (2009-2018) was conducted to provide insights into evolutionary relationships and persistence. Multiple analytical approaches were applied including MLST, wgMLST and phylogenetic SNP analysis. The CHASRI was identified in all isolates associated with the sequence type 14 (ST14) and ST316, suggesting an adaptation in response to extrinsic pressures, such as in the farm environment. There is evidence of persistent Salmonella Senftenberg and Montevideo strains in pistachio pre-harvest and post-harvest environments. Utilizing metagenomic sequencing during an inoculated storage study of pistachios allowed for determination of surviving serovars over an extended period of time. Defining the mechanisms of persistence of these strains is of high importance to public health.",

    "abstract": "Organophosphorus compounds have an extensive history as both agricultural pesticides as well as chemical nerve agents. Decades of research have demonstrated numerous links between these chemicals and their direct and indirect effects on humans and other organisms. The inhibitory effects of organophosphate pesticides (OPPs) on metazoan physiology, are well-characterized; however, the effects of organophosphorus compounds on soil microbes - essential contributors to key agricultural processes - are poorly understood. Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an OPP that is used globally for crop protection. Studies of CPF application to soils have shown transient effects on soil microbial communities with conflicting data. Here, we directly test the effect of CPF on a panel of 196 actinobacteria strains, examining the effects of CPF on their growth and in vitro phenotypes on solid media. Strains were grown and replica-plated onto media containing CPF or a vehicle control and grown at 28{degrees}C. CPF dramatically inhibited the growth of most strains and/or altered colony morphologies, with 13 strains completely inhibited by CPF. In disk diffusion assays with CPF, its degradation product 3,5,6-trichloropyridinol (TCP), malathion, parathion, monocrotophos and mevinphos, only CPF exhibited direct antimicrobial activity suggesting that the observed effects were due to CPF itself.\n\nIMPORTANCEChlorpyrifos is a globally used pesticide with documented neurological effects on non-target organisms in the environment. Finding that chlorpyrifos can inhibit the growth of some soil microbes in vitro may have implications for the composition, stability, and health of the soil microbiome. Due to the importance of soil microbes to numerous biogeochemical processes in agricultural systems, additional investigations into the non-target effects of CPF on soil microbes are clearly needed.",

    "abstract": "On 11th March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). To date, there are rapidly spreading new \"variants of concern\" of SARS-CoV-2, the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), the South African (B.1.351) or Brasilian (P.1) variant. All of them contain multiple mutations in the ACE2 receptor recognition site of the spike protein, compared to the original Wuhan sequence, which is of great concern, because of their potential for immune escape. Here we report on the efficacy of common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) to block protein-protein interaction of spike S1 to the human ACE2 cell surface receptor. This could be shown for the original spike D614, but also for its mutant forms (D614G, N501Y, and mix of K417N, E484K, N501Y) in human HEK293-hACE2 kidney and A549-hACE2-TMPRSS2 lung cells. High molecular weight compounds in the water-based extract account for this effect. Infection of the lung cells using SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus particles was efficiently prevented by the extract and so was virus-triggered pro-inflammatory interleukin 6 secretion. Modern herbal monographs consider the usage of this medicinal plant as safe. Thus, the in vitro results reported here should encourage further research on the clinical relevance and applicability of the extract as prevention strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nSignificance statementSARS-CoV-2 is steadily mutating during continuous transmission among humans. This might eventually lead the virus into evading existing therapeutic and prophylactic approaches aimed at the viral spike. We found effective inhibition of protein-protein interaction between the human virus cell entry receptor ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike, including five relevant mutations, by water-based common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) extracts. This was shown in vitro using human kidney (HEK293) and lung (A549) cells, overexpressing the ACE2 and ACE2/TMPRSS2 protein, respectively. Infection of the lung cells using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus was efficiently prevented by the extract. The results deserve more in-depth analysis of dandelions effectiveness in SARS-CoV-2 prevention and now require confirmatory clinical evidence.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine nitration (PTN), a highly selective post translational modification, occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells under nitrosative stress1. It is reported that the activities of many proteins are altered due to PTN2. PTN is found to be associated with many pathophysiological conditions like neurodegenerative and cardiac diseases etc.3. However, its physiological function is not yet clear. Like all other gut pathogens Vibrio cholerae also faces nitrosative stress in the gut environment which makes its proteome more vulnerable to PTN. Here, we report for the first time in-vivo PTN in V. cholerae. We show that in-vivo protein nitration is nitrite dependent and nitration-denitration phenomenon actually facilitates V. cholerae cell survival in anaerobic or hypoxic condition. In our study, we found that the extent of in-vivo nitration is negatively correlated with the intracellular nitrite content and maximum nitration occurs during log phase of V. cholerae. Most interestingly, a significant denitration was associated with increase in intracellular nitrate content during anaerobic incubation of aerobically grown late log phase cultures. In-vivo nitration could provide an avenue for toxic nitrite storage and nitrosative stress tolerance mechanism in many gut pathogens, whereas denitration could supply nitrate for cell survival in anaerobic nitrate deficient environment.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes is a primary control mechanism of cellular function. Similarities in regulation of expression for select genes between lymphocytes and neurons have led to proposals that such genes may be useful biomarkers for some neurological disorders that can be monitored via patient lymphocyte populations. Examination of shared molecular mechanisms underlying neurogenesis and lymphocyte differentiation may give help to identify relevant pathways and suggest additional biomarkers in lymphocytes that are relevant to neurological disorders. In this study, we analysed similarities and conserved regions in several genes regulated by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) during lymphocyte and neuronal developmental stages. We performed epigenetic analysis of CTCF binding Trak1, Gabpa, Gabpb1, Gabpb2, Gfi1, Gfi1b gene loci at T and B lymphocytes at different developmental stages, as well as in neural progenitor cells and motor neurons. Common and shared CTCF binding events at Trak1 gene suggest additional transcriptional regulatory factors that control Trak1 gene expression levels differ in neurons and lymphocytes. Gabpb1 gene includes a common CTCF binding site shared with neurons and lymphocytes. Correlation of CTCF binding analysis and gene expression profile suggests that CTCF binding plays a role in epigenetic regulation of Gabpb1 gene. In contrast, while Gfi1a gene is phylogenetically well-conserved and CTCF sites are occupied in lymphocytes, there are no CTCF binding occupied in neurons and neural progenitor cells. Low expression levels of Gfi1s in neurons indicate that regulation of this gene is CTCF-independent in neurons. Although Gfi1b is highly homologous to Gfi1, differences in expression levels suggest that Gfi1b is critical for both lymphogenesis and neurogenesis. Neurons and lymphocytes have multiple common CTCF binding sites in the Gfi1b gene, although lineage specific transcriptional regulators that play a role in their different expression levels still need to be identified. The partial overlap in CTCF regulatory sites for some genes in neurons and lymphocytes suggest that there may be markers that can exhibit parallel changes in these cells and serve as biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Critically ill COVID-19 patients are characterized by a severely dysregulated cytokine profile and elevated neutrophil counts, which are thought to contribute to disease severity. However, to date it remains unclear how neutrophils contribute to pathophysiology during COVID-19. Here, we assessed the impact of the dysregulated cytokine profile on the tightly regulated cell death program of neutrophils. We show that in a subpopulation of neutrophils, canonical apoptosis was skewed towards rapidly occurring necroptosis. This phenotype was characterized by abrogated caspase-8 activity and increased RIPK1 levels, favoring execution of necroptosis via the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL axis, as further confirmed in COVID-19 biopsies. Moreover, reduction of sFas-L levels in COVID-19 patients and hence decreased signaling to Fas directly increased RIPK1 levels and correlated with disease severity. Our results suggest an important role for Fas signaling in the regulation of cell death program ambiguity via the ripoptosome in neutrophils during COVID-19 and a potential therapeutic target to curb inflammation and thus influence disease severity and outcome.",

    "abstract": "Distinguishing between unique species and populations with strong genetic structure is a common challenge in population genetics, especially in fragmented habitats where allopatric speciation may be widespread and distinct groups may be morphologically similar. Such is often the case with species complexes across sky island environments. In these scenarios, biogeography may help to explain the relations between species complex members, and RADseq methods are commonly used to compare closely related species across thousands of genetic loci. Here we use RADseq to clarify the relations between geographically distinct but morphologically similar varieties of the Primula cusickiana species complex, and to contextualize past findings of strong genetic structure among populations within varieties. Our genomic analyses demonstrate pronounced separation between isolated populations of this Great Basin endemic, indicating that the current varietal classification of complex members is inaccurate and emphasizing their conservation importance. We discuss how these results correspond to recent biogeographical models used to describe the distribution of other sky island taxa in western North America. Our findings also fit into a wider trend observed for alpine Primula species complexes, and we consider how heterostylous breeding systems may be contributing to frequent diversification via allopatric speciation in this genus.",

    "abstract": "Long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are a proven tool to reduce malaria transmission, but in Africa efficacy is being reduced by pyrethroid resistance in the major vectors. A cluster randomized trial in Muleba district, Tanzania demonstrated that permethrin LLINs co-treated with piperonyl butoxide (PBO), a synergist that can block pyrethroid-metabolizing enzymes in the mosquito, had much greater efficacy than pyrethroid-only nets. Insecticide resistance profiles and underlying mechanisms were investigated in Anopheles gambiae and An. funestus from Muleba during the trial. Diagnostic dose bioassays using permethrin, together with intensity assays, suggest pyrethroid resistance that is both strong and very common, but not extreme. Transcriptomic analysis found multiple P450 genes over expressed including CYP6M2, CYP6Z3, CYP6P3, CYP6P4, CYP6AA1 and CYP9K1 in An. gambiae and CYP6N1, CYP6M7, CYP6M1 and CYP6Z3 in An. funestus. Indeed, very similar suites of P450 enzymes commonly associated with resistant populations elsewhere in Africa were detected as over expressed suggesting a convergence of mechanisms across Sub-Saharan African malaria vectors. The findings give insight into factors that may correlate with pyrethroid PBO LLIN success, broadly supporting model predictions, but revision to guidelines previously issued by the World Health Organization is warranted.",

The objective of this study aims at determining the identity of trans-differentiated cells by exploring the effect of EPA and DHA on C2C12 undergoing differentiation into brown and white adipocytes. DHA but not EPA committed C2C12 cells reprograming into white like adipocyte phenotype. Also, DHA promoted the expression of lipolysis regulating genes but had no effect on genes regulating {beta}-oxidation referring to its implication in lipid re-esterification. Furthermore, DHA impaired C2C12 cells differentiation into brown adipocytes through reducing the thermogenic capacity and mitochondrial biogenesis of derived cells independent of UCP1. Accordingly, DHA treated groups showed an increased accumulation of lipid droplets and suppressed mitochondrial maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity. EPA, on the other hand, reduced myogenesis regulating genes, but no significant differences were observed in the expression of adipogenesis key genes. Likewise, EPA suppressed the expression of WAT signature genes indicating that EPA and DHA have an independent role on white adipogeneis. Unlike DHA treatment, EPA supplementation had no effect on the differential of C2C12 cells into brown adipocytes. In conclusion, DHA is a potent adipogenic and lipogenic factor that can change the metabolic profile of muscle cells by increasing myocellular fat.",

However, limited to our knowledge, most of them gave an overfitting estimation of their generalization ability in new data because of the intrinsic trait--not considering the experimental sources of the new data--of the cross-validation method. Thus, we proposed and explored a new method--the experiment-split method--imitating the blinded assessment to deal with the overfitting problem in the new data. The experiment-split method logically split the training and test data based on the datas different experimental sources, and the new data can be regarded as the data from different experimental sources. To specifically illustrate the experiment-split method, we combined an actual application, DeepKme--a predictor built by us for the lysine methylation sites, to demonstrate how it be used in the true scenarios. We compared the cross-validation method with the experiment-split method. The result suggested the experiment-split method could effectively relieve the overfitting compared with the cross-validation method and may be widely used in the field of identification participated by multiple experiments. We believe DeepKme would facilitate the related researchers deep thought of the experiment-split method and the overfitting phenomenon, and of course, advance the study of the lysine methylation and similar fields.",

    "abstract": "Human behaviors are at least partially driven by genomic regions that influence human-specific neurodevelopment. This includes genomic regions undergoing human specific sequence acceleration (Human Accelerated Regions or HARs) and regions showing human-specific enhancer activity (Human Gained Enhancers or HGEs) not present in other primates. However, prior studies on HAR/HGE activities involved mixtures of brain cell types and focused only on putative downstream target genes. Here, we directly measured cell type specific HAR/HGE activity in the developing fetal human brain using two independent single-cell chromatin accessibility datasets with matching single-cell gene expression data. Transcription factor (TF) motif analyses identified upstream TFs binding to HARs/HGEs and identified LHX2, a key regulator of forebrain development, as an active HGE regulator in neuronal progenitors. We integrated our TF motif analyses with published chromatin interaction maps to build detailed regulatory networks where TFs are linked to downstream genes via HARs/HGEs. Through these networks, we identified a potential regulatory role for NFIC in human neuronal progenitor networks via modulating the Notch signaling and cell adhesion pathways. Therefore, by using a single cell multi-omics approach, we were able to capture both the upstream and downstream regulatory context of HARs/HGEs, which may provide a more comprehensive picture of the roles HARs/HGEs play amongst diverse fetal cell types of the developing human brain.",

    "abstract": "Successful engagement with the world requires the ability to predict what will happen next. Here we investigate how the brain makes the most basic prediction about the physical world: whether the situation in front of us is stable, and hence likely to stay the same, or unstable, and hence likely to change in the immediate future. Specifically, we ask if judgements of stability can be supported by the kinds of representations that have proven to be highly effective at visual object recognition in both machines and brains, or instead if the ability to determine the physical stability of natural scenes may require generative algorithms that simulate the physics of the world. To find out, we measured responses in both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the brain (using fMRI) to natural images of physically stable versus unstable scenarios. We find no evidence for generalizable representations of physical stability in either standard CNNs trained on visual object and scene classification (ImageNet), or in the human ventral visual pathway, which has long been implicated in the same process. However, in fronto-parietal regions previously implicated in intuitive physical reasoning we find both scenario-invariant representations of physical stability, and higher univariate responses to unstable than stable scenes. These results demonstrate abstract representations of physical stability in the dorsal but not ventral pathway, consistent with the hypothesis that the computations underlying stability entail not just pattern classification but forward physical simulation.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful means to identify loci and genes contributing to disease, but in many cases the related cell types/states through which genes confer disease risk remain unknown. Deciphering such relationships is important for identifying pathogenic processes and developing therapeutics. Here, we introduce sc-linker, a framework for integrating single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), epigenomic maps and GWAS summary statistics to infer the underlying cell types and processes by which genetic variants influence disease. We analyzed 1.6 million scRNA-seq profiles from 209 individuals spanning 11 tissue types and 6 disease conditions, and constructed gene programs capturing cell types, disease progression, and cellular processes both within and across cell types. We evaluated these gene programs for disease enrichment by transforming them to SNP annotations with tissue-specific epigenomic maps and computing enrichment scores across 60 diseases and complex traits (average N=297K). Cell type, disease progression, and cellular process programs captured distinct heritability signals even within the same cell type, as we show in multiple complex diseases that affect the brain (Alzheimers disease, multiple sclerosis), colon (ulcerative colitis) and lung (asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, severe COVID-19). The inferred disease enrichments recapitulated known biology and highlighted novel cell-disease relationships, including GABAergic neurons in major depressive disorder (MDD), a disease progression M cell program in ulcerative colitis, and a disease-specific complement cascade process in multiple sclerosis. In autoimmune disease, both healthy and disease progression immune cell type programs were associated, whereas for epithelial cells, disease progression programs were most prominent, perhaps suggesting a role in disease progression over initiation. Our framework provides a powerful approach for identifying the cell types and cellular processes by which genetic variants influence disease.",
