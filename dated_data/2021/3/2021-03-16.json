    "abstract": "Immunological memory is an important concept to protect humans against recurring diseases. Memory CD8+ T cells are required for quick expansion into effector cells but also provide immediate cytotoxicity against their targets. Whereas many functions of the two main cytotoxic subtypes, effector memory CD8+ T cells (TEM) and central memory CD8+ T cells (TCM), are relatively well defined, single TEM and TCM cell cytotoxicity has not been quantified. Here, we analyze human CD8+ subtype distribution following SEA stimulation and quantify the expression of death mediators, including perforin, granzyme B, FasL and TRAIL. We find higher perforin, granzyme B and FasL expression in TEM and compared to TCM. To quantify single TEM and TCM cytotoxicity, we develop a FRET-based fluorescent assay with NALM6 target cells stably transfected with a GFP-RFP FRET construct based on a caspase-cleavage sequence (apoptosis sensor Casper-GR). Applying this assay, TEM or TCM induced target cell apoptosis or necrosis can be quantified. We find that single TEM are much more effective than TCM in killing their targets mainly by apoptosis and secondary necrosis. The reason for this is the higher perforin expression and on a more efficient lytic immunological synapse during TEM-target contact compared to TCM-target contact. Defining and quantifying single TEM and TCM cytotoxicity and the respective mechanism should be helpful to optimize future subset-based immune therapies.",

    "abstract": "The crisis of antibiotic resistant bacterial infections is one of the most pressing public health issues. Common agricultural practices have been implicated in the generation of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Biopesticides, live bacteria used for pest control, are non-pathogenic and considered safe for consumption. Application of bacteria-based pesticides to crops in high concentrations raises the possibility of unintentional contributions to the movement and generation of antibiotic resistance genes in the environment. However, the presence of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes and their resistance phenotypes are currently unknown. Here we use a combination of multiple bioinformatic and microbiological techniques to define resistomes of widely used biopesticides and determine how the presence of suspected antibiotic resistance genes translates to observable resistance phenotypes in several biopesticide products. Our results demonstrate that biopesticide products are reservoirs of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes and bear resistance to multiple drug classes.\n\nImportanceThis is the first study to specifically address antibiotic resistance in widely distributed bacterial strains used as commercial biopesticides. Safety assessments of commercial live bacterial biopesticide products do not include antibiotic resistance phenotype identification. We identify antibiotic resistance genes in all live bacterial strains examined, and resistant phenotypes in all strains tested for antibiotic susceptibility. This work demonstrates that biopesticides potentially play a critical role as reservoirs and vectors of antibiotic resistance in the broader environmental resistome that is to date, unstudied.",

    "abstract": "Abnormalities of lipid/lipoprotein and glucose metabolism are hallmarks of hepatic insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. The former antedate the latter, but the latter become progressively refractory to treatment and contribute to therapeutic failures. Its unclear whether the two processes share a common pathogenesis and what underlies their progressive nature. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that genes in the lipid/lipoprotein pathway and those in the glucose metabolic pathway are governed by different transcriptional logics that affect their response to physiologic (fasting/refeeding) as well as pathophysiologic cues (insulin resistance and hyperglycemia). To this end, we obtained genomic and transcriptomic maps of the key insulin-regulated transcription factor, FoxO1, and integrated them with those of CREB, PPAR, and glucocorticoid receptor. We found an enrichment of glucose metabolic genes among those regulated by intergenic and promoter enhancers in a fasting-dependent manner, while lipid genes were enriched among fasting-dependent intron enhancers and fasting-independent enhancer-less introns. Glucose genes also showed a remarkable transcriptional resiliency, i.e., an enrichment of active marks at shared PPAR/FoxO1 regulatory elements when FoxO1 was inactivated. Surprisingly, the main features associated with insulin resistance and hyperglycemia were a \"spreading\" of FoxO1 binding to enhancers, and the emergence of target sites unique to this condition. We surmise that this unusual pattern correlates with the progressively intractable nature of hepatic insulin resistance. This transcriptional logic provides an integrated model to interpret the combined lipid and glucose abnormalities of type 2 diabetes.\n\nSignificance StatementThe liver is a source of excess lipid, atherogenic lipoproteins, and glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes. These factors predispose to micro- and macrovascular complications. The underlying pathophysiology is not well understood, and mechanistic insight into it may provide better tools to prevent, treat, and reverse the disease. Here we propose an alternative explanation for this pathophysiologic conundrum by illustrating a transcriptional \"logic\" underlying the regulation of different classes of genes. These findings can be interpreted to provide an integrated stepwise model for the coexistence of lipid and glucose abnormalities in hepatic insulin resistance.\n\nHighlightsO_LIFoxo1 regulates liver metabolism through active enhancers, and hepatocyte maintenance through core promoters\nC_LIO_LIFoxo1 regulates glucose genes through fasting-dependent intergenic enhancers\nC_LIO_LIBipartite intron regulation of lipid genes is partly fasting-independent\nC_LIO_LIPpar contributes to the transcriptional resiliency of Foxo1 metabolic targets\nC_LIO_LIInsulin resistance causes de novo recruitment of Foxo1 to active enhancers\nC_LIO_LIA stepwise model of insulin resistance\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Bile acids play crucial roles in host physiology by acting as both detergents that aid in digestion and as signaling molecules that bind to host receptors. Gut bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) enzymes perform the gateway reaction leading to the conversion of host-produced primary bile acids into bacterially modified secondary bile acids. Small molecule probes that target BSHs will help elucidate the causal roles of these metabolites in host physiology. We previously reported the development of a covalent BSH inhibitor with low gut permeability. Here, we build on our previous findings and describe the development of a second-generation gut-restricted BSH inhibitor with enhanced potency, reduced off-target effects, and durable in vivo efficacy. SAR studies focused on the bile acid core identified a compound, AAA-10, containing a C3-sulfonated lithocholic acid scaffold and an alpha-fluoromethyl ketone warhead as a potent pan-BSH inhibitor. This compound inhibits BSH activity in conventional mouse fecal slurries, bacterial cultures, and purified BSH proteins and displays reduced toxicity against mammalian cells compared to first generation compounds. Oral administration of AAA-10 to wild-type mice for 5 days resulted in a decrease in the abundance of the secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA) in the mouse GI tract with low systemic exposure of AAA-10, demonstrating that AAA-10 is an effective tool for inhibiting BSH activity and modulating bile acid pool composition in vivo.",

Here we show that basal gene expression patterns can be conditioned by learned small molecule structure to better predict cellular drug sensitivity, achieving an R2 of 0.7190{+/-}0.0098 (a 5.61% gain). We find that 1) transforming gene expression values by learned small molecule representations outperforms raw feature concatenation, 2) small molecule structural features meaningfully contribute to learned representations, and 3) an affine transformation best integrates these representations. We analyze conditioning parameters to determine how small molecule representations modulate gene expression embeddings.

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) can be used to characterize cellular heterogeneity in thousands of cells. The reconstruction of a gene network based on coexpression patterns is a fundamental task in scRNA-seq analyses, and the mutual exclusivity of gene expression can be critical for understanding such heterogeneity. Here, we propose an approach for detecting communities from a genetic network constructed on the basis of coexpression properties. The community-based comparison of multiple coexpression networks enables the identification of functionally related gene clusters that cannot be fully captured through differential gene expression-based analysis. We also developed a novel metric referred to as the exclusively expressed index (EEI) that identifies mutually exclusive gene pairs from sparse scRNA-seq data. EEI quantifies and ranks the exclusive expression levels of all gene pairs from binary expression patterns while maintaining robustness against a low sequencing depth. We applied our methods to glioblastoma scRNA-seq data and found that gene communities were partially conserved after serum stimulation despite a considerable number of differentially expressed genes. We also demonstrate that the identification of mutually exclusive gene sets with EEI can improve the sensitivity of capturing cellular heterogeneity. Our methods complement existing approaches and provide new biological insights, even for a large, sparse dataset, in the single-cell analysis field.",

In this paper, we show that the problem of computing a maximum parsimony reconciliation for a gene tree and species network is NP-hard even when only considering deep coalescence.

Our generation of a constitutive knockout mouse for the N-terminal methyltransferase NRMT1, demonstrated its loss results in severe developmental abnormalities and premature aging. As premature aging is often accompanied by neurodegeneration, we more specifically examined how NRMT1 loss affects neural pathology and cognitive behaviors. Here we find that Nrmt1-/- mice exhibit postnatal enlargement of the lateral ventricles, age-dependent striatal and hippocampal neurodegeneration, memory impairments, and hyperactivity. These morphological and behavior abnormalities are preceded by alterations in neural stem cell (NSC) development. Depletion of quiescent NSC pools in Nrmt1-/- mice is concurrent with expansion of intermediate progenitor and neuroblast pools. These phenotypes are similar to those seen with loss of the NRMT1 target retinoblastoma protein (RB), and we see that NRMT1 loss leads to derepression of RB target genes and abnormal RB phosphorylation and degradation. As also seen with RB loss, neurons in Nrmt1-/- mice fail to exit cell cycle and ultimately undergo NOXA-mediated apoptosis, indicating that early misregulation of RB in Nrmt1-/- mice promotes premature NSC proliferation and contributes to subsequent neurodegenerative phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Many microbes grow diauxically, utilizing the available resources one at a time rather than simultaneously. The properties of communities of microbes growing diauxically remain poorly understood, largely due to a lack of theory and models of such communities. Here, we develop and study a minimal model of diauxic microbial communities assembling in a serially diluted culture. We find that unlike co-utilizing communities, diauxic community assembly repeatably and spontaneously leads to communities with complementary resource preferences, i.e., communities where species prefer different resources as their top choice. Simulations and theory explain that the emergence of complementarity is driven by the disproportionate contribution of the top choice resource to the growth of a diauxic species. Additionally, we develop a geometric approach for analyzing serially diluted communities, with or without diauxie, which intuitively explains several additional emergent community properties, such as the apparent lack of species which grow fastest on a resource other than their most preferred resource. Overall, our work provides testable predictions for the assembly of natural as well as synthetic communities of diauxically shifting microbes.",

    "abstract": "Wireless power transfer (WPT) is frequently used as an alternative to batteries to accomplish miniaturization in electronic medical implants (eMIs). However, established WPT methods require bulky parts within the implant or cumbersome external systems, hindering minimally invasive deployments and the development of networks of eMIs. As an alternative, we propose a WPT approach based on volume conduction of high frequency (HF) current bursts. These currents are applied through external textile electrodes and are collected by the eMIs through two electrodes at their opposite ends. This approach avoids bulky components to obtain power, making it possible to develop implants with a flexible threadlike conformation. In here we study in humans if HF (6.78 MHz) current bursts complying with safety standards and applied through two textile electrodes strapped around a limb can provide substantial powers from pairs of implanted electrodes. Time averaged electric powers obtained from needle electrodes (diameter = 0.4 mm, length = 3 mm, separation = 30 mm) inserted into arms and lower legs of five healthy participants were 5.9 {+/-} 0.7 mW and 2.4 {+/-} 0.3 mW respectively. We also report a procedure to characterize the coupling between the external system and the implants using two-port impedance models generated from medical images. The results demonstrate for the first time in humans that innocuous and imperceptible HF current bursts that flow through the tissues by volume conduction can be used to wirelessly power threadlike eMIs, overcoming the limitations of existing WPT methods in terms of minimal invasiveness and usability.",

Therefore, there is a high demand for vaccines with enhanced efficacy, high thermostability, superior design flexibility, and fast manufacturing speed. Here, we report a circular RNA (circRNA) vaccine that encodes the trimeric RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Without the need of nucleotide modification, 5-capping or 3-polyadenylation, circRNA could be rapidly produced via in vitro transcription and is highly thermostable whether stored in naked or lipid-nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated format. LNP-encapsulated circRNARBD elicited potent neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses, providing robust protection against Beta (B.1.351) and native viruses in mice and rhesus macaques, respectively. Notably, circRNA vaccine enabled higher and more durable antigen production than 1m{Psi}-modified mRNA vaccine, eliciting a higher proportion of neutralizing antibodies and stronger Th1-biased immune responses. Importantly, we found that circRNARBD-Omicron vaccine induced effective neutralizing antibodies against only Omicron but not Delta variant. By contrast, circRNARBD-Delta could elicit high level of neutralizing antibodies against both Delta and Omicron. Following two doses of either native- or Delta-specific vaccination, circRNARBD-Delta, but not Omicron or Beta vaccines, could effectively boost the neutralizing antibodies against both Delta and Omicron variants. These results suggest that circRNARBD-Delta is a favorable choice for vaccination to provide a broad-spectrum protection against the current variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2.",

Statistical evaluation of long-term records of TP (Total Phosphorus) concentrations in headwaters and potential resources in the Hula Valley was carried out to identify efficient management design targets. Significant correlation between major headwater river discharge and TP concentration was indicated, whilst the impact of external fertilizer loads and 50,000 winter migratory cranes was probably negligible. Nevertheless, confirmed severe bdamage to agricultural crops carried out by cranes led to their maximal deportation and optimization of their feeding policy. Consequently, the continuation of the present management is recommended.",
