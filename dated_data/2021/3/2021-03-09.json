    "abstract": "One of the central questions about the cognitive neuroscience of creativity is the extent to which creativity depends on either domain-specific or domain-general mechanisms. To address this question, we carried out two parallel activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses of creativity: 1) a motoric analysis that combined studies across five domains of creative production (verbalizing, music, movement, writing, and drawing), and 2) an analysis of the Alternate Uses divergent-thinking task. All experiments contained a contrast between a creative task and a matched non-creative or less-creative task that controlled for the sensorimotor demands of task performance. The activation profiles of the two meta-analyses were non-overlapping, but both pointed to a domain-specific interpretation in which creative production is, at least in part, an enhancement of sensorimotor brain areas involved in non-creative production. The most concordant areas of activation in the motoric meta-analysis were high-level motor areas such as the pre-supplementary motor area and inferior frontal gyrus that interface motor planning and executive control, suggesting a means of uniting domain-specificity and -generality in creative production.",

    "abstract": "As an adaptive system, the brain must retain a faithful representation of the world while continuously integrating new information. Recent experiments have measured population activity in cortical and hippocampal circuits over many days, and found that patterns of neural activity associated with fixed behavioral variables and percepts change dramatically over time. Such \"representational drift\" raises the question of how malleable population codes can interact coherently with stable long-term representations that are found in other circuits, and with relatively rigid topographic mappings of peripheral sensory and motor signals. We explore how known plasticity mechanisms can allow single neurons to reliably read out an evolving population code without external error feedback. We find that interactions between Hebbian learning and single-cell homeostasis can exploit redundancy in a distributed population code to compensate for gradual changes in tuning. Recurrent feedback of partially stabilized readouts could allow a pool of readout cells to further correct inconsistencies introduced by representational drift. This shows how relatively simple, known mechanisms can stabilize neural tuning in the short term, and provides a plausible explanation for how plastic neural codes remain integrated with consolidated, long-term representations.\n\nSignificanceThe brain is capable of adapting while maintaining stable long-term memories and learned skills. Recent experiments show that neural responses are highly plastic in some circuits, while other circuits maintain consistent responses over time, raising the question of how these circuits interact coherently. We show how simple, biologically motivated Hebbian and homeostatic mechanisms in single neurons can allow circuits with fixed responses to continuously track a plastic, changing representation without reference to an external learning signal.",

    "abstract": "Here we characterise an uncommon set of telomeres from Streptomyces rimosus ATCC 10970, the parental strain of a lineage of one of the earliest-discovered antibiotic-producers. Following the closure of its genome sequence, we then compared unusual telomeres from this organism with the other five classes of replicon ends found amongst streptomycetes. Closed replicons of streptomycete chromosomes were organised with respect to their phylogeny and physical orientation, which demonstrated that different telomeres were not associated with particular clades and were likely shared amongst different strains by plasmid-driven horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, we identified a ~50 kb origin island with conserved synteny that is located at the core of all streptomycete chromosomes and forms an axis around which symmetrical chromosome inversions can take place. Despite this chromosomal bilateral symmetry, a bias in parS sites to the right of oriC is maintained across the family Streptomycetaceae and suggests that the formation of ParB/parS nucleoprotein complexes on the right replichore is a conserved feature in streptomycetes. Consequently our studies reveal novel features of linear bacterial replicons that, through their manipulation, may lead to improvements in growth and productivity of this important industrial group of bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Viruses belonging to the Nucleocytoviricota phylum are globally-distributed and include members with notably large genomes and complex functional repertoires. Recent studies have shown that these viruses are particularly diverse and abundant in marine systems, but the magnitude of actively replicating Nucleocytoviricota present in ocean habitats remains unclear. In this study, we compiled a curated database of 2,431 Nucleocytoviricota genomes and used it to examine the gene expression of these viruses in a 2.5-day metatranscriptomic time-series from surface waters of the California Current. We identified 145 viral genomes with high levels of gene expression, including 90 Imitervirales and 49 Algavirales viruses. In addition to recovering high expression of core genes involved in information processing that are commonly expressed during viral infection, we also identified transcripts of diverse viral metabolic genes from pathways such as glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway, suggesting that virus-mediated reprogramming of central carbon metabolism is common in oceanic surface waters. Surprisingly, we also identified viral transcripts with homology to actin, myosin, and kinesin domains, suggesting that viruses may use them to manipulate host cytoskeletal dynamics during infection. We performed phylogenetic analysis on the virus-encoded myosin and kinesin proteins, which demonstrated that most belong to deep-branching viral clades, but that others appear to have been acquired from eukaryotes more recently. Our results highlight a remarkable diversity of active Nucleocytoviricota in a coastal marine system and underscore the complex functional repertoires expressed by these viruses during infection.\n\nImportanceThe discovery of giant viruses has transformed our understanding of viral complexity. Although viruses have traditionally been viewed as filterable infectious agents that lack metabolism, giant viruses can reach sizes rivalling cellular lineages and possess genomes encoding central metabolic processes. Recent studies have shown that giant viruses are widespread in aquatic systems, but the activity of these viruses and the extent to which they reprogram host physiology in situ remains unclear. Here we show that numerous giant viruses consistently express central metabolic enzymes in a coastal marine system, including components of glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and other pathways involved in nutrient homeostasis. Moreover, we found expression of several viral-encoded actin, myosin, and kinesin genes, indicating viral manipulation of the host cytoskeleton during infection. Our study reveals a high activity of giant viruses in a coastal marine system and indicates they are a diverse and underappreciated component of microbial diversity in the ocean.",

    "abstract": "Listeria ivanovii (Liv) is an intracellular Gram-positive pathogen that primarily infects ruminants, but also occasionally causes enteric infections in humans. Albeit rare, this bacterium possesses the capacity to cross the intestinal epithelium of humans, similar to its more frequently pathogenic cousin, Listeria monocytogenes (Lmo). Recent studies in Lmo have shown that specific glycosyl modifications on the cell wall-associated glycopolymers (termed wall-teichoic acid, or WTA) of Lmo are responsible for bacteriophage adsorption and retention of the major virulence factor, Internalin B (InlB). However, the relationship between InlB and WTA in Liv remains unclear. Here, we report the identification of the unique gene, liv1070 that encodes a putative glucosyltransferase in the polycistronic WTA gene cluster of the Liv WSLC 3009 genome. We found that in-frame deletion of liv1070 led to loss of the glucose substitution on WTA, as revealed by UPLC-MS analysis. Interestingly, the glucose-deficient mutant became resistant to phage B025 infection due to an inability of the phage to adsorb to the bacterial surface, a binding process mediated by the receptor-binding protein B025_Gp17. As expected, deletion of liv1070 led to loss of InlB retention to the bacterial cell wall, which corresponded to a drastic decrease in cellular invasion. Genetic complementation of liv1070 restored the characteristic phenotypes, including glucose decoration, phage adsorption, and cellular invasion. Taken together, our data demonstrate that an interplay between phage, bacteria, and host cells also exists in Listeria ivanovii, suggesting the trade-off between phage resistance and virulence attenuation may be a general feature in the Listeria genus.\n\nImportanceListeria ivanovii is a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen known to cause enteric infection in rodents and ruminants, and occasionally in immunocompromised humans. Recent investigations revealed that, in its better-known cousin Listeria monocytogenes, strains develop resistance to bacteriophage attack due to loss of glycosylated surface receptors, which subsequently resulting in disconnection of one of the bacteriums major virulence factors, InlB. However, the situation in L. ivanovii remains unclear. Here, we show that L. ivanovii acquires phage resistance following deletion of a unique glycosyltransferase. This deletion also leads to dysfunction of InlB, making the resulting strain unable to invade host cells. Overall, this study suggests that the interplay between phage, bacteria and the host may be a feature common to the Listeria genus.",

    "abstract": "Chemosynthetic organisms flourish around deep-sea hydrothermal vents where energy-rich fluids are emitted from metal sulfide chimneys. In contrast to actively venting chimneys, the nature of microbial life in extinct chimneys without fluid venting remains largely unknown. Here, the occurrence of ultra-small cells in silica-filled grain boundaries inside an extinct chimney is demonstrated by high-resolution bio-signature mapping. The ultra-small cells are associated with extracellularly precipitated Cu2O nanocrystals. Single-gene analysis shows that the chimney interior is dominated by a member of Pacearchaeota known as a major phylum of DPANN. Genome-resolved metagenomic analysis reveals that the chimney Pacearchaeota member is equipped with a nearly full set of genes for fermentation-based energy generation from nucleic acids, in contrast to previously characterized Pacearchaeota members lacking many genes for nucleic acid fermentation. We infer that the ultra-small cells associated with silica and extracellular Cu2O nanocrystals in the grain boundaries are Pacearchaeota, on the basis of the experimentally demonstrated capability of silica to concentrate nucleic acids from seawater and the presence of Cu-exporting genes in a reconstructed Pacearchaeota genome. Given the existence of ~3-billion-year-old submarine hydrothermally deposited silica, proliferation of microbial life using silica-bound nucleic acids might be relevant to the primitive vent biosphere.",

    "abstract": "Sharks and rays are possibly the most threatened Class of marine fishes and their declines can be halted if protected areas are optimised to benefit these species. We identify spatial priorities for all 63 endemic sharks and rays in the marine biodiversity hotspot, the Western Indian Ocean (WIO). Collectively, while the WIO nations currently surpass the 10% Aichi ocean protection target, this amounts to a dismal protection of only 1.57% of each species distribution range. We show that the entire ranges of all endemics can be achieved by protecting 11% of EEZs of WIO nations, well within reach of the new 30% of oceans by 2030 target. Regional management bodies exist, which if taken advantage of to implement shark and ray management, provide opportunities to implement more efficient management across the region. We recommend key management actions to implement and explicit incentivisation of international cooperation in the post-2020 biodiversity framework.\n\nScience for SocietyThe past decade has seen massive growth in the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), driven by the Aichi biodiversity target of protecting 10% of all ocean areas. This expansion of MPAs, however, has largely occurred in areas residual to extractive uses, often coinciding with less threatened areas of lower conservation value. This coming decade will see a further push to ensure 30% of the oceans are protected by 2030. It is important to understand how existing and future MPAs should be placed to benefit threatened biodiversity. Currently this is unclear for sharks and rays, comprising a species group that is the most evolutionarily distinct vertebrate radiation in the world and also one of the most threatened. We identify both regional and national conservation priorities for expanding marine protected areas to benefit all 63 endemic sharks and rays occurring in the Western Indian Ocean region. We find that the region has already exceeded the 10% ocean protection target, but this amounts to an average of only 1.57% protection of the distribution ranges of these species. We show that protecting the top 10% priority sites will conserve almost half of the geographic range of each species yet require only 1.16% of the total EEZ - a tiny fraction of the 30% by 2030 target. We also show that regional collaboration among all nations can result in more spatially efficient conservation priorities. We recommend that the post-2020 biodiversity framework needs to explicitly incentivise regional cooperation between nations to efficiently achieve urgent targets and maximise benefits to biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Premise of the studyOctoploid strawberry (Fragaria sp.) has a complex evolutionary history that has until recently been intractable due to limitations of available genomic resources. While recent work has further uncovered the evolutionary history of the octoploid strawberry, there are still open questions. Much is still unknown about the evolutionary relationship of the wild octoploid species, Fragaria virginiana and Fragaria chiloensis, and gene flow within and among species after the original formation of the octoploid genome.\n\nMethodsWe leveraged a diversity collection of wild octoploid eco-types of strawberry representing the recognized subspecies and ranging from Alaska to Southern Chile, and a high density SNP array to investigate wild octoploid strawberry evolution. Evolutionary relationships are interrogated with phylogenetic analysis and genetic clustering algorithms. Additionally, admixture among and within species is assessed with model-based and tree-based approaches.\n\nKey ResultsPhylogenetic analysis revealed that the two octoploid strawberry species are monophyletic sister lineages. The genetic clustering results show substructure between North Americana and South American F. chiloensis populations. Additionally, model-based and tree-based methods support gene flow within and among the two octoploid species, including newly identified admixture in the Hawaiian F. chiloensis subsp. sandwicensis population that appears to be from an ancestral F. chiloensis population.\n\nConclusionF. virginiana and F. chiloensis are supported as monophyletic and sister lineages. All but one of the subspecies recognized within both octoploid species show extensive paraphyly. Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationship among F. chiloensis populations supports a single population range expansion southward from North America. The inter- and intraspecific relationships of octoploid strawberry are complex and suggest substantial and deep gene flow between sympatric populations among and within species.",

    "abstract": "Mass drug administration (MDA) with antimalarials has been shown to reduce prevalence and interrupt transmission in small populations, in populations with reliable access to antimalarial drugs, and in populations where sustained improvements in diagnosis and treatment are possible. Effective MDA eliminates drug-resistant parasites which has the long-term benefit of extending the useful therapeutic life of first-line therapies for all populations, not just the focal population where MDA was carried out. However, in order to plan elimination measures effectively, it is necessary to characterize the conditions under which failed MDA could exacerbate resistance. We use an individual-based stochastic model of Plasmodium falciparum transmission to evaluate this risk in large populations (>40K) where access to antimalarial treatments may not be uniformly high and where re-importation of drug-resistant parasites may be common. We find that drug-resistance evolution can be accelerated by MDA when all three of the following conditions are met: (1) strong genetic bottlenecking that falls short of elimination, (2) re-importation of resistant genotypes, and (3) continued selection pressure during routine case management post-MDA. Accelerated resistance levels are not immediate but follow the rebound of malaria cases post-MDA, if this is allowed to occur. Crucially, resistance is driven by the selection pressure during routine case management post-MDA and not the selection pressure exerted during the MDA itself. Second, we find that increasing treatment coverage post-MDA increases the probability of local elimination in low-transmission regions (PfPR < 2%) in scenarios with both low and high levels of drug-resistance importation. This emphasizes the importance of preparation and planning to ensure that MDA has a high probability of leading to elimination, and the necessity of supporting public health infrastructure to provide high coverage of diagnosis and treatment post-MDA.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial genus Xylella contains plant pathogens that are major threats to agriculture in America and Europe. Although extensive research was conducted to characterize different subspecies of Xylella fastidiosa (Xf), comparative analysis at above-species levels were lacking due to the unavailability of appropriate data sets. Recently, a bacterium that causes pear leaf scorch (PLS) in Taiwan was described as the second Xylella species (i.e., Xylella taiwanensis; Xt). In this work, we report the complete genome sequence of Xt type strain PLS229T. The genome-scale phylogeny provided strong support that Xf subspecies pauca (Xfp) is the basal lineage of this species and Xylella was derived from the paraphyletic genus Xanthomonas. Quantification of genomic divergence indicated that different Xf subspecies share [~]87-95% of their chromosomal segments, while the two Xylella species share only [~]66-70%. Analysis of overall gene content suggested that Xt is most similar to Xf subspecies sandyi (Xfs). Based on the existing knowledge of Xf virulence genes, the homolog distribution among 28 Xylella representatives was examined. Among the 11 functional categories, those involved in secretion and metabolism are the most conserved ones with no copy number variation. In contrast, several genes related to adhesins, hydrolytic enzymes, and toxin-antitoxin systems are highly variable in their copy numbers. Those virulence genes with high levels of conservation or variation may be promising candidates for future studies. In summary, the new genome sequence and analysis reported in this work contributed to the study of several important pathogens in the family Xanthomonadaceae.\n\nContribution to the FieldXylella fastidiosa is a plant-pathogenic bacterium with multiple subspecies that are major threats to agriculture in America and Europe. Although extensive research has been conducted, comparative analysis of this species with other bacteria is lacking due to the unavailability of known close relatives. In this work, we report the complete genome sequence of Xylella taiwanensis, a newly described species within the same genus. This new data set and our focused analysis helped to better understand the evolutionary relationships among different Xylella lineages and their genomic diversity. Moreover, detailed examination of their virulence genes identified those that are either highly conserved or variable, providing promising candidates for future studies to further investigate the molecular mechanisms of Xylella virulence.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionDNA-based surveillance of bacterial diseases has been using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) since 1996. Currently, the international surveillance network (PulseNet international) is turning toward whole genome sequencing (WGS). ATCGs of WGS are compared using several sequence alignment methods. While patterns of horizontal lines of PFGE profiles are being compared using relative positioning of bands within a range of tolerance. A recently suggested image analysis algorithm and a deployed database (geltowgs.uofk.edu) collectively invented a promising method for comparing PFGE to in-silico obtained digestion models (DMs) derived from WGS. The database requires a parameter that determines PFGE resolution. Here, the author suggests a new method for calculating this factor. Epidemiological and molecular conclusions returned by the database are evaluated.\n\nMethodologytwo PFGE profiles representing XbaI digests of E. coli and Salmonella enterica analyzed by the suggested image analysis algorithm were submitted to the database after calculating resolution of PFGE using Dice percentage of difference between the closest PFGE bands in length. E. coli and Salmonella enterica test subjects were compared to 489 and 401 DMs respectively. The three data sets returned were analyzed.\n\nResults and conclusionsaccording to modified PFGE evaluation criteria; a single DM is possibly related to E. coli test subject. It belonged to the same serovar. No epidemiologically related DM was shown for S. enterica test subject. Conclusions mentioned earlier could never be made ignoring co-migration. Standardization of both; suggested image analysis and database algorithms will deepen our understanding of bacterial epidemiology by means of possible qualitative approach built upon identification of fragment sequences and their locations within chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "Four species of grass generate half of all human-consumed calories1. However, abundant biological data on species that produce our food remains largely inaccessible, imposing direct barriers to understanding crop yield and fitness traits. Here, we assemble and analyse a continent-wide database of field experiments spanning ten years and hundreds of thousands of machine-phenotyped populations of ten major crop species. Training an ensemble of machine learning models, using thousands of variables capturing weather, ground-sensor, soil, chemical and fertiliser dosage, management, and satellite data, produces robust cross-continent yield models exceeding R2 = 0.8 prediction accuracy. In contrast to  black box analytics, detailed interrogation of these models reveals fundamental drivers of crop behaviour and complex interactions predicting yield and agronomic traits. These results demonstrate the capacity of machine learning models to build unified, interpretable, and explainable models of crop behaviour, and highlight the powerful role of data in the future of food.",

    "abstract": "Cells must control the cell cycle to ensure that key processes are brought to completion. In Escherichia coli, it is controversial whether cell division is tied to chromosome replication or to a replication-independent inter-division process. A recent model suggests instead that both processes may limit cell division with comparable odds in single cells. Here, we tested this possibility experimentally by monitoring single-cell division and replication over multiple generations at slow growth. We then perturbed cell width, causing an increase of the time between replication termination and division. As a consequence, replication became decreasingly limiting for cell division, while correlations between birth and division and between subsequent replication-initiation events were maintained. Our experiments support the hypothesis that both chromosome replication and a replication-independent inter-division process can limit cell division: the two processes have balanced contributions in non-perturbed cells, while our width perturbations increase the odds of the replication-independent process being limiting.",

    "abstract": "Machado-Joseph disease (MJD, also known as spinocerebellar ataxia-3) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that impairs control and coordination of movement. Here we tested whether treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium valproate (SV) prevented a movement phenotype that develops in larvae of a transgenic zebrafish model of the disease. We found that treatment with SV improved the swimming of the MJD zebrafish, increased levels of acetylated histones 3 and 4, but also increased expression of polyglutamine expanded human ataxin-3. Proteomic analysis of protein lysates generated from the treated and untreated MJD zebrafish also predicted that SV treatment had activated the sirtuin longevity signaling pathway and this was confirmed by findings of increased SIRT1 protein levels and sirtuin activity in SV treated MJD zebrafish and HEK293 cells expressing ataxin-3-84Q, respectively. Treatment with resveratrol (another compound known to activate the sirtuin pathway), also improved swimming in the MJD zebrafish. Co-treatment with SV alongside EX527, a SIRT1 activity inhibitor, prevented induction of autophagy by SV and the beneficial effects of SV on the movement in the MJD zebrafish, indicating that they were both dependent on sirtuin activity. These findings provide the first evidence of sodium valproate inducing activation of the sirtuin pathway. Further, they indicate that drugs that target the sirtuin pathway, including sodium valproate and resveratrol, warrant further investigation for the treatment of MJD and related neurodegenerative diseases.",

Fitting the model to data estimates both a cascade of linear filters on the stimulus, as wells as the static nonlinearities that map the output of the filters to the neuronal spike rates. We found that cells respond differently to these two classes of stimuli, with mostly higher spike rates and shorter response latencies to NS than to WGN. The most striking finding was that NS resulted in RFs that had additional uncovered filters than did WGN. This finding was not an artefact of the higher spike rates but rather related to a change in coding. Our results reveal a greater extent of nonlinear processing in V1 neurons when stimulated using NS compared to WGN. Our findings indicate the existence of nonlinear mechanisms that endow V1 neurons with context-dependent transmission of visual information.",

    "abstract": "Verbal instructions allow fast and optimal implementation of novel behaviors. Previous research has shown that different control-related variables structure neural activity in frontoparietal regions during the encoding of novel instructed tasks. However, it is uncertain whether different task goals modulate the organizing effect of these variables. In this study, we investigated whether the neural encoding of three task-relevant variables (dimension integration, response set complexity and target category) is modulated by implementation and memorization demands. To do so, we combined functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), an instruction-following paradigm and multivariate analyses. We addressed how and where distributed activity patterns encoded the instructions variables and the impact of the implementation and memorization demands on the fidelity of these representations. We further explored the nature of the neural code underpinning this process. Our results reveal, first, that the content of to-be-implemented and to-be-memorized instructions is represented in overlapping brain regions, flexibly using a common neural code across tasks. Importantly, they also suggest that preparing to implement the instructions increases the decodability of task-relevant information in frontoparietal areas, in comparison with memorization demands. Overall, our work emphasizes both similarities and differences in task coding under the two contextual demands. These findings qualify the previous understanding of novel instruction processing, suggesting that representing task attributes in a generalizable code, together with the increase in encoding fidelity induced by the implementation goals, could be key mechanisms for proactive control in novel scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Stem cells undergo asymmetric division to produce both a self-renewing stem cell and a differentiating daughter cell. During Drosophila male germline stem cell (GSC) asymmetric division, preexisting old histones H3 and H4 are enriched in the self-renewed stem daughter cell, whereas the newly synthesized H3 and H4 are enriched in the differentiating daughter cell. However, the biological consequences in the two daughter cells resulting from asymmetric histone inheritance remained to be elucidated. In this work, we track both old and new histones throughout GSC cell cycle using high spatial and temporal resolution microscopy. We find several unique features differentiating old versus new histone-enriched sister chromatids, including nucleosome density, chromosomal condensation, and H3 Ser10 phosphorylation. These distinct chromosomal features lead to their differential association with Cdc6, an essential component of the pre-replication complex, which subsequently contributes to asynchronous initiation of DNA replication in the two resulting daughter cells. Disruption of asymmetric histone inheritance abolishes both differential Cdc6 association and asynchronous S-phase entry, demonstrating that asymmetric histone acts upstream of these critical events during cell cycle progression. Furthermore, GSC defects are detected under these conditions, indicating a connection between histone inheritance, cell cycle progression and cell fate decision. Together, these studies reveal that cell cycle remodeling as a crucial biological  readout of asymmetric histone inheritance, which precedes and could lead to other well-known readouts such as differential gene expression. This work also enhances our understanding of asymmetric histone inheritance and epigenetic regulation in other stem cells or asymmetrically dividing cells in multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "New SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge from the current global pandemic, some of which can replicate faster and with greater transmissibility and pathogenicity. In particular, UK501Y.V1 identified in UK, SA501Y.V2 in South Africa, and BR501Y.V3 in Brazil are raising serious concerns as they spread quickly and contain spike protein mutations that may facilitate escape from current antibody therapies and vaccine protection. Here, we constructed a panel of 28 SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses bearing single or combined mutations found in the spike protein of these three variants, as well as additional nine mutations that within or close by the major antigenic sites in the spike protein identified in the GISAID database. These pseudoviruses were tested against a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including some approved for emergency use to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, and convalescent patient plasma collected early in the pandemic. SA501Y.V2 pseudovirus was the most resistant, in magnitude and breadth, against mAbs and convalescent plasma, followed by BR501Y.V3, and then UK501Y.V1. This resistance hierarchy corresponds with Y144del and 242-244del mutations in the N-terminal domain as well as K417N/T, E484K and N501Y mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD). Crystal structural analysis of RBD carrying triple K417N-E484K-N501Y mutations found in SA501Y.V2 bound with mAb P2C-1F11 revealed a molecular basis for antibody neutralization and escape. SA501Y.V2 and BR501Y.V3 also acquired substantial ability to use mouse and mink ACE2 for entry. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate major antigenic shifts and potentially broadening the host range of SA501Y.V2 and BR501Y.V3, which pose serious challenges to our current antibody therapies and vaccine protection.",

This B.1.1.7 variant increased rapidly in prevalence among sequenced strains, attributed to an increase in infection and/or transmission efficiency. The UK variant has 19 nonsynonymous mutations across its viral genome including 8 substitutions or deletions in the spike protein, which interacts with cellular receptors to mediate infection and tropism. Here, using a reverse genetics approach, we show that, of the 8 individual spike protein substitutions, only N501Y exhibited consistent fitness gains for replication in the upper airway in the hamster model as well as primary human airway epithelial cells. The N501Y substitution recapitulated the phenotype of enhanced viral transmission seen with the combined 8 UK spike mutations, suggesting it is a major determinant responsible for increased transmission of this variant. Mechanistically, the N501Y substitution improved the affinity of the viral spike protein for cellular receptors. As suggested by its convergent evolution in Brazil and South Africa, our results indicate that N501Y substitution is a major adaptive spike mutation of major concern.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria utilize dynamic appendages called type IV pili (T4P) to interact with their environment and mediate a wide variety of functions. Pilus extension is mediated by an extension ATPase motor, commonly called PilB, in all T4P. Pilus retraction, however, can either occur with the aid of an ATPase motor, or in the absence of a retraction motor. While much effort has been devoted to studying motor-dependent retraction, the mechanism and regulation of motor-independent retraction remains poorly characterized. We have previously demonstrated that Vibrio cholerae competence T4P undergo motor-independent retraction in the absence of the dedicated retraction ATPases PilT and PilU. Here, we utilize this model system to characterize the factors that influence motor-independent retraction. We find that freshly extended pili frequently undergo motor-independent retraction, but if these pili fail to retract immediately, they remain statically extended on the cell surface. Importantly, we show that these static pili can still undergo motor-dependent retraction via tightly regulated ectopic expression of PilT, suggesting that these T4P are not broken, but simply cannot undergo motor-independent retraction. Through additional genetic and biophysical characterization of pili, we suggest that pilus filaments undergo conformational changes during dynamic extension and retraction. We propose that only some conformations, like those adopted by freshly extended pili, are capable of undergoing motor-independent retraction. Together, these data highlight the versatile mechanisms that regulate T4P dynamic activity and provide additional support for the long-standing hypothesis that motor-independent retraction occurs via spontaneous depolymerization.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEExtracellular pilus fibers are critical to the virulence and persistence of many pathogenic bacteria. A crucial function for most pili is the dynamic ability to extend and retract from the cell surface. Inhibiting this dynamic pilus activity represents an attractive approach for therapeutic interventions, however, a detailed mechanistic understanding of this process is currently lacking. Here, we use the competence pilus of Vibrio cholerae to study how pili retract in the absence of dedicated retraction motors. Our results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism of pilus retraction that is an inherent property of the external pilus filament. Thus, understanding the conformational changes that pili adopt under different conditions may be critical for the development of novel therapeutics that aim to target the dynamic activity of these structures.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of cholera, a notorious diarrheal disease that is typically transmitted via contaminated drinking water. The current pandemic agent, the El Tor biotype, has undergone several genetic changes that include horizontal acquisition of two genomic islands (VSP-I and VSP-II). VSP-I and -2 presence strongly correlates with pandemicity; however, the contribution of these islands to V. choleraes life cycle, particularly the 26-kb VSP-II, remains poorly understood. VSP-II-encoded genes are not expressed under standard laboratory conditions, suggesting that their induction requires an unknown signal from the host or environment. One signal that bacteria encounter under both host and environmental conditions is metal limitation. While studying V. choleraes zinc-starvation response in vitro, we noticed that a mutant constitutively expressing zinc-starvation genes ({Delta}zur) aggregates in nutrient-poor media. Using transposon mutagenesis, we found that flagellar motility, chemotaxis, and VSP-II encoded genes are required for aggregation. The VSP-II genes encode an AraC-like transcriptional activator (VerA) and a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (AerB). Using RNA-seq and lacZ transcriptional reporters, we show that VerA is a novel Zur target and activator of the nearby AerB chemoreceptor. AerB interfaces with the chemotaxis system to drive oxygen-dependent autoaggregation and energy taxis. Importantly, this work suggests a functional link between VSP-II, zinc-starved environments, and aerotaxis, yielding insights into the role of VSP-II in a metal-limited host or aquatic reservoir.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe Vibrio Seventh Pandemic island was horizontally acquired by El Tor pandemic strain, but its role in pathogenicity or environmental persistence is unknown. A major barrier to VSP-II study was the lack of stimuli favoring its expression. We show that zinc starvation induces expression of this island and describe a transcriptional network that activates a VSP-II encoded aerotaxis receptor. Importantly, aerotaxis may enable V. cholerae to locate more favorable microenvironments, possibly to colonize anoxic portions of the gut or environmental sediments.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSurveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is critical to reducing its wide-reaching impact. Its reliance on sample size invites solutions to longstanding constraints regarding scalability. A robotic platform (RASP) was developed for high-throughput AMR surveillance in accordance with internationally recognised standards (CLSI and ISO 20776-1:2019) and validated through a series of experiments.\n\nMethodsExperiment A compared RASPs ability to achieve consistent MICs to that of a human technician across eight replicates for four E. coli isolates. Experiment B assessed RASPs agreement with human performed MICs across 91 E. coli isolates with a diverse range of AMR profiles. Additionally, to demonstrate its real-world applicability, the RASP workflow was then applied to five faecal samples where a minimum of 47 E. coli per animal (239 total) were evaluated using an AMR indexing framework.\n\nResultsFor each drug-rater-isolate combination in experiment A, there was a clear consensus of the MIC and deviation from the consensus remained within one doubling-dilution (the exception being gentamicin at two dilutions). Experiment B revealed a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.9670 (95%CI: 0.9670 - 0.9670) between the robot and human performed MICs. RASPs application to the five faecal samples highlighted the intra-animal diversity of gut commensal E. coli, identifying between five and nine unique isolate AMR phenotypes per sample.\n\nConclusionsWhile adhering to internationally accepted guidelines, RASP was superior in throughput, cost and data resolution when compared to an experienced human technician. Integration of robotics platforms in the microbiology laboratory is a necessary advancement for future One-Health AMR endeavours.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBuilding the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance network in Veterinary medicine (EARS-Vet) was proposed to strengthen the European One Health antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance approach.\n\nObjectivesThe objectives were to (i) define the combinations of animal species, production types, age categories, bacterial species, specimens and antimicrobials to be monitored in EARS-Vet and to (ii) determine antimicrobial test panels able to cover most combinations.\n\nMethodsThe EARS-Vet scope was defined by consensus between 26 European experts. Decisions were guided by a survey of the combinations that are relevant and feasible to monitor in diseased animals in 13 European countries (bottom-up approach). Experts also considered the One Health approach and the need for EARS-Vet to complement existing European AMR monitoring systems coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).\n\nResultsEARS-Vet would monitor AMR in six animal species (cattle, swine, chicken (broiler and laying hen), turkey, cat and dog), for 11 bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus suis). Relevant antimicrobials for their treatment were selected (e.g. tetracyclines) and complemented with antimicrobials of more specific public health interest (e.g. carbapenems). Three test panels of antimicrobials were proposed covering most EARS-Vet combinations of relevance for veterinary antimicrobial stewardship.\n\nConclusionsWith this scope, EARS-Vet would enable to better address animal health in the strategy to mitigate AMR and better understand the multi-sectoral AMR epidemiology in Europe.",

    "abstract": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has infected over 115 million people and caused over 2.5 million deaths worldwide. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19, as well as what distinguishes them from common seasonal influenza virus and other lung injury states such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), remains poorly understood. To address these challenges, we combined transcriptional profiling of 646 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs and 39 patient autopsy tissues, matched with spatial protein and expression profiling (GeoMx) across 357 tissue sections. These results define both body-wide and tissue-specific (heart, liver, lung, kidney, and lymph nodes) damage wrought by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, evident as a function of varying viral load (high vs. low) during the course of infection and specific, transcriptional dysregulation in splicing isoforms, T cell receptor expression, and cellular expression states. In particular, cardiac and lung tissues revealed the largest degree of splicing isoform switching and cell expression state loss. Overall, these findings reveal a systemic disruption of cellular and transcriptional pathways from COVID-19 across all tissues, which can inform subsequent studies to combat the mortality of COVID-19, as well to better understand the molecular dynamics of lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection and other viruses.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) can persist over long periods of time within their host cell and thereby establish chronic infections. One of the major inducers of chlamydial persistence is interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) released by immune cells as a mechanism of immune defence. IFN-{gamma} activates the catabolic depletion of L-tryptophan (Trp) via indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), resulting in persistent Chlamydia. Here we show that IFN-{gamma} depletes c-Myc, the key regulator of host cell metabolism, in a STAT1-dependent manner. Expression of c-Myc rescued Chlamydia from IFN-{gamma}-induced persistence in cultured cell lines, but also in human fallopian tube organoids. L-tryptophan concentrations control c-Myc levels via the PI3K-GSK3{beta} axis. Unbiased metabolic analysis revealed that Chlamydia infection reprograms the host cell tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to support pyrimidine biosynthesis. Addition of TCA cycle intermediates or pyrimidine/purine nucleosides to infected cells rescued Chlamydia from IFN-{gamma}-induced persistence. Thus, our results challenge the longstanding hypothesis of L-tryptophan depletion through IDO as the major mechanism of IFN-{gamma}-induced metabolic immune defence and significantly extends the understanding of the role IFN-{gamma} as a broad modulator of host cell metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) manifests lung pathology that resembles human COVID-19 patients. In this study, efforts were made to check the infectivity of a local SARS-CoV-2 isolate in hamster model and evaluate the differential expression of lung proteins during acute infection and convalescence. The findings of this study confirm the infectivity of this isolate in vivo. Analysis of clinical parameters and tissue samples shows a similar type of pathophysiological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection as reported earlier in COVID-19 patients and hamsters infected with other isolates. The lung-associated pathological changes were very prominent on the 4th day post-infection (dpi), mostly resolved by 14dpi. Here, we carried out quantitative proteomic analysis of the lung tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters at day 4 and day 14 post infection. This resulted in the identification of 1,585 differentially expressed proteins of which 68 proteins were significantly altered among both the infected groups. Pathway analysis revealed complement and coagulation cascade, platelet activation, ferroptosis and focal adhesion as the top enriched pathways. In addition, we also identified altered expression of two pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins (Sftpd and Sftpb), known for their protective role in lung function. Together, these findings will aid in the identification of candidate biomarkers and understanding the mechanism(s) involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=143 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/434371v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1930556org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14376d6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2f064eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1472572_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Intracellular pH (pHi) dynamics are critical for regulating normal cell physiology. For example, transient increases in pHi (7.2-7.6) regulate cell behaviors like cell polarization, actin cytoskeleton remodeling, and cell migration. Most studies on pH-dependent cell behaviors have been performed at the population level and use non-specific methods to manipulate pHi. The lack of tools to specifically manipulate pHi at the single-cell level has hindered investigation of the role of pHi dynamics in driving single cell behaviors. In this work, we show that Archaerhodopsin (ArchT), a light-driven outward proton pump, can be used to elicit robust and physiological pHi increases over the minutes timescale. We show that activation of ArchT is repeatable, enabling the maintenance of high pHi in single cells for approximately 45 minutes. We apply this spatiotemporal pHi manipulation tool to determine whether increased pHi is a sufficient driver of membrane ruffling in single cells. Using the ArchT tool, we show that increased pHi in single cells can drive localized membrane ruffling responses within seconds and increased membrane dynamics (both protrusion and retraction events) compared to unstimulated ArchT cells as well as control cells. Overall, this tool allows us to directly investigate the relationship between increased pHi and cell behaviors such as membrane ruffling. This tool will be transformative in facilitating experiments required to determine if increased pHi drives these cell behaviors at the single-cell level.",

    "abstract": "Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and on surfaces is critical to prevent the fecal-oral and fomite transmission, respectively. We hypothesized that visible light active photocatalysts could dramatically enhance the rate or extent of virus inactivation and enable the use of visible light rather than shorter wavelength ultraviolet light. A novel visible light active photocatalyst, boron-doped bismuth oxybromide (B-BiOBr), was synthesized and tested for its SARS-CoV-2 inactivation towards Vero E6 cell lines in dark and under irradiation at 426 nm by a light emitting diode (LED) in water. SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in the presence of B-BiOBr (0.8 g/L) under LED irradiation reached 5.32-log in 5 min, which was 400 to 10,000 times higher than those achieved with conventional photocatalysts of tungsten or titanium oxide nanomaterials, respectively. Even without LED irradiation, B-BiOBr inactivated 3.32-log of SARS-CoV-2 in the dark due to the ability of bismuth ions interfering with the SARS-CoV-2 helicase function. LED irradiation at 426 nm alone, without the photocatalyst, contributed to 10% of the observed inactivation and was attributed to production of reactive oxygen species due to blue-light photoexcitation of molecules in the culture media, which opens further modes of action to engineer disinfection strategies. The visible light active B-BiOBr photocatalyst, with its rapid SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in the presence and absence of light, holds tremendous opportunities to build a healthy environment by preventing the fecal-oral and fomite transmission of emerging pathogens.",

    "abstract": "The highly-transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants now replacing the first wave strain pose an increased threat to human health by their ability, in some instances, to escape existing humoral protection conferred by previous infection, neutralizing antibodies, and possibly vaccination. Thus, other therapeutic options are necessary. One such therapeutic option that leverages SARS-CoV-2 initiation of infection by binding of its spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) to surface-expressed host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an ACE2  decoy that would trap the virus by competitive binding and thus inhibit propagation of infection. Here, we used Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations to predict ACE2 mutations that might increase its affinity for S RBD and screened these candidates for binding affinity in vitro. A double mutant ACE2(T27Y/H34A)-IgG1FC fusion protein was found to have very high affinity for S RBD and to show greater neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 in a live virus assay as compared to wild type ACE2. We further modified the double mutant ACE2 decoy by addition of an H374N mutation to inhibit ACE2 enzymatic activity while maintaining high S RBD affinity. We then confirmed the potential efficacy of our ACE2(T27Y/H34A/H374N)-IgG1FC Triple Decoy against S RBD expressing variant-associated E484K, K417N, N501Y, and L452R mutations and found that our ACE2 Triple Decoy not only maintains its high affinity for S RBD expressing these mutations, but shows enhanced affinity for S RBD expressing the N501Y or L452R mutations and the highest affinity for S RBD expressing both the E484K and N501Y mutations. The ACE2 Triple Decoy also demonstrates the ability to compete with wild type ACE2 in the cPass surrogate virus neutralization in the presence of S RBD with these mutations. Additional MD simulation of ACE2 WT and decoy interactions with S RBD WT or B.1.351 variant sequence S RBD provides insight into the enhanced affinity of the ACE2 decoy for S RBD and reveals its potential as a tool to predict affinity and inform therapeutic design. The ACE2 Triple Decoy is now undergoing continued assessment, including expression by a human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) construct to facilitate delivery in vivo.\n\nSummary sentenceAn ACE2(N27Y/H34A/H374N)-IgG1FC fusion protein decoy sustains high affinity to all SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) protein variants tested, shows enhanced affinity for the N501Y and L452R variants, and the highest affinity for combined N501Y and E484K variants.",

In the present study we have used cryoEM to solve high-resolution structures of the channel in liposomes using a gel-filtration approach with on-column detergent removal to form liposomes and incorporate the channel simultaneously, a method that improved the incorporation rate by more than 20-fold compared to a dialysis-based approach. In conjunction with new direct-detection cameras, this allowed us to resolve the structure of the channel in the closed and open states at 3.36 and 3.98 [A], respectively. This method offers validation for detergent-based structures of the RyR and lays the groundwork for studies utilizing an electrochemical gradient mimicking the native environment, such as that of the SR, where Ca2+ concentrations are millimolar in the lumen and nanomolar in the cytosol of the cell at rest.",

Dissecting these specificities at scale requires integrated methods for multiplexed genetic screens tracking fitness across time, across human cell types, and in a suitable cellular niche since functional differences also depend on physiological cues. Towards this, we present a novel approach, harnessing single-cell cancer driver screens in teratomas coupled with hit enrichment by serial teratoma reinjection, to simultaneously screen drivers across multiple lineages in vivo. Using this system, we analyzed population shifts and lineage-specific enrichment for 51 cancer associated genes and gene variants, profiling over 100,000 cells spanning over 20 lineages, across two rounds of serially injected teratomas. We confirmed that c-MYC alone or combined with myristoylated AKT1 potently drives proliferation in progenitor neural lineages, demonstrating signatures of malignancy. These drivers directed teratoma development to lineages representative of pediatric tumors such as medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Additionally, mutant MEK1S218D/S222D provides a proliferative advantage in mesenchymal lineages like fibroblasts. Our method provides a powerful new platform for multi-lineage longitudinal study of oncogenesis.",

Currently, there are limited therapeutic options against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and testing of a number of drug regimens has led to conflicting results. Here we show that cobicistat, which is an-FDA approved drug-booster that blocks the activity of the drug metabolizing proteins Cytochrome P450-3As (CYP3As) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Cell-to-cell membrane fusion assays indicated that the antiviral effect of cobicistat is exerted through inhibition of spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. In line with this, incubation with low micromolar concentrations of cobicistat decreased viral replication in three different cell lines including cells of lung and gut origin. When cobicistat was used in combination with the putative CYP3A target and nucleoside analog remdesivir, a synergistic effect on the inhibition of viral replication was observed in cell lines and in a primary human colon organoid. The cobicistat/remdesivir combination was able to potently abate viral replication to levels comparable to mock-infected cells leading to an almost complete rescue of infected cell viability. These data highlight cobicistat as a therapeutic candidate for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection and as a potential building block of combination therapies for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, which depend on the host cellular machineries to replicate their genome and complete their infectious cycle. Long double stranded (ds)RNA is a common viral by-product originating during RNA virus replication and is universally sensed as a danger signal to trigger the antiviral response. As a result, viruses hide dsRNA intermediates into viral replication factories and have evolved strategies to hijack cellular proteins for their benefit. The characterization of the host factors associated with viral dsRNA and involved in viral replication remains a major challenge to develop new antiviral drugs against RNA viruses. Here, we performed anti-dsRNA immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry analysis to fully characterize the dsRNA interactome in Sindbis virus (SINV) infected human cells. Among the identified proteins, we characterized SFPQ (Splicing factor, proline-glutamine rich) as a new dsRNA-associated proviral factor upon SINV infection. We showed that SFPQ depletion reduces SINV infection in human HCT116 and SK-N-BE(2) cells, suggesting that SFPQ enhances viral production. We demonstrated that the cytoplasmic fraction of SFPQ partially colocalizes with dsRNA upon SINV infection. In agreement, we proved by RNA-IP that SFPQ can bind dsRNA and viral RNA. Furthermore, we showed that overexpression of a wild type, but not an RNA binding mutant SFPQ, increased viral infection, suggesting that RNA binding is essential for its positive effect on the virus. Overall, this study provides the community with a compendium of dsRNA-associated factors during viral infection and identifies SFPQ as a new proviral dsRNA binding protein.",

    "abstract": "Metabolites, or the small organic molecules that are synthesized by cells during metabolism, comprise a complex and dynamic pool of carbon in the ocean. They are an essential form of information, linking genotype to phenotype at the individual, population and community levels of biological organization. Characterizing metabolite distributions inside microbial cells and dissolved in seawater is essential to understanding the controls on their production and fate, as well as their roles in shaping marine microbial food webs. Here, we apply a targeted metabolomics method to quantify particulate and dissolved distributions of a suite of biologically relevant metabolites including vitamins, amino acids, nucleic acids, osmolytes, and intermediates in biosynthetic pathways along a latitudinal transect in the western Atlantic Ocean. We find that, in the euphotic zone, most particulate or intracellular metabolites positively co-vary with the most abundant microbial taxa. In contrast, dissolved metabolites exhibited greater variability with differences in distribution between ocean regions. Although fewer particulate metabolites were detected below the euphotic zone, molecules identified in the deep ocean may be linked to preservation of organic matter or adaptive physiological strategies of deep-sea microbes. Based on the identified metabolite distributions, we propose relationships between certain metabolites and microbial populations, and find that dissolved metabolite distributions are not directly related to their particulate abundances.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate here that the acquisition of DNAase resistance by transforming DNA, often assumed to indicate transport to the cytoplasm, actually reflects uptake to the periplasm, requiring a re-evaluation of conclusions about the roles of several proteins in transformation. The new evidence suggests that the transformation pilus is needed for DNA binding to the cell surface near the cell poles and for the initiation of uptake. The cellular distribution of the membrane-anchored ComEA of B. subtilis does not noticeably change during DNA uptake as does the unanchored ComEA of Vibrio and Neisseria. Instead, our evidence suggests that ComEA stabilizes the attachment of transforming DNA at localized regions in the periplasm and then mediates uptake, probably by a Brownian ratchet mechanism. Following that, the DNA is transferred to periplasmic portions of the channel protein ComEC, which plays a previously unsuspected role in uptake to the periplasm. We show that the transformation endonuclease NucA also facilitates uptake to the periplasm and that the previously demonstrated role of ComFA in the acquisition of DNAase resistance actually derives from the instability of ComGA when ComFA is deleted. These results prompt a new understanding of the early stages of DNA uptake for transformation.\n\nIMPORTANCETransformation is a widely distributed mechanism of bacterial horizontal gene transfer that plays a role in the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes and more generally in evolution. Although transformation was discovered nearly a century ago and most, if not all of the proteins required have been identified in several bacterial species, much remains poorly understood about the molecular mechanism of DNA uptake. This study uses epifluorescence microscopy to investigate the passage of labeled DNA into the compartment between the cell wall and the cell membrane of Bacillus subtilis, a necessary early step in transformation. The roles of individual proteins in this process are identified, and their modes of action are clarified.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) disease affects a substantial subset of chronic Chagas disease (CD) patients, but the mechanism of pathogenesis is poorly understood. The lack of a robust, predictive animal model of chronic T. cruzi infection that exhibits functional digestive disease has held back research. To address this, we combined GI tracer assays and bioluminescence in vivo infection imaging systems for diverse parasite strains to discover models exhibiting chronic digestive transit dysfunction. We identified the colon as a specific site of both tissue parasite persistence and delayed transit. Digestive CD mice exhibited significant retention of faeces in both sated and fasted conditions. Histological and immunofluorescence analysis of the enteric nervous system (ENS) revealed a dramatic reduction in the number of neurons and a loss of immunoreactivity of the enteric neural network in the colon. This model therefore recapitulates key clinical manifestations of human digestive CD. We also exploited dual bioluminescent-fluorescent parasites to analyse rare chronic infection foci in the colon at the single cell level, revealing co-localisation with ENS lesions. This indicates that long-term T. cruzi-host interactions in the colon drive pathogenesis and thus chronic disease may be preventable using anti-parasitic chemotherapy.",

To bridge this knowledge gap, we need a reliable model system that recapitulates early stages of human embryogenesis. Here we report a [~]three-dimensional (3D), two-step induction protocol for generating blastocyst-like structures (EPS-blastoids) from human extended pluripotent stem (EPS) cells. Morphological and single-cell transcriptomic analyses revealed that EPS-blastoids contain key cell lineages and are transcriptionally similar to human blastocysts. Furthermore, EPS-blastoids also exhibited the developmental potential to undergo post-implantation morphogenesis in vitro to form structures with a cellular composition and transcriptome signature similar to human embryos that had been cultured in vitro for 8 or 10 days. In conclusion, human EPS-blastoids provide a new experimental platform for studying early developmental stages of the human embryo.\n\nHighlightsA method for generating human blastoids from EPS cells.\n\nHuman blastoids resemble blastocysts in terms of morphology and cell lineage composition.\n\nSingle-cell transcriptomic analyses reveal EPI, PE, and TE cell lineages in human blastoids.\n\nHuman blastoids mimic in vitro the morphogenetic events of pre- and early post-implantation stages.",

However, while tissue- and disease-specific analyses have been performed, little is known about the location and consequences on gene expression of these regulatory regions in human pluripotent cells. Poised enhancers and bivalent promoters function in a coordinated fashion during development, which requires timely and efficient histone modifications. Identification of KDM6A-specific gene-regulatory domains is important for understanding the developmental mechanisms controlled by these histone modifications in pluripotency. In this study, we compared genome-wide histone modification and gene expression differences in isogenic wild type and cas9-mediated KDM6A knockout human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) lines. Here, we report that the absence of KDM6A does not alter the pluripotent phenotype but does substantially alter the histone modification profile at poised and active enhancers, resulting in decreased expression of associated COMPASS complex genes KMT2C and KMT2D and subsequently increasing the expression of gene pathways involved in ectoderm differentiation.",

We find patterns which are conserved across all samples and this can be associated with site-specific stalling of glycan maturation which act as a highly sensitive reporter of protein structure.

    "abstract": "Metastasis is the major cause of mortality in breast cancer patients. Many signaling pathways have been linked to cancer invasiveness, but blockade of few protein components has succeeded in reducing metastasis. Thus, identification of proteins contributing to invasion that are manipulable by small molecules may be valuable in inhibiting spread of the disease. The protein kinase WNK1 (with no lysine (K) 1) has been suggested to induce migration of cells representing a range of cancer types. Analyses of mouse models and patient data have implicated WNK1 as one of a handful of genes uniquely linked to invasive breast cancer. Here we present evidence that inhibition of WNK1 slows breast cancer metastasis. We show that depletion or inhibition of WNK1 reduces migration of several breast cancer cell lines in wound healing assays and decreases invasion in collagen matrices. Furthermore, WNK1 depletion suppresses expression of AXL, a tyrosine kinase implicated in metastasis. Finally, we demonstrate that WNK inhibition in mice attenuates tumor progression and metastatic burden. These data showing reduced migration, invasion, and metastasis upon WNK1 depletion in multiple breast cancer models suggest that WNK1 contributes to the metastatic phenotype and that WNK1 inhibition may offer a therapeutic avenue for attenuating progression of invasive breast cancers.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics, such as tetracycline, has been frequently used to cure endosymbiont Wolbachia in arthropods. After the symbionts had been removed, the hosts must be waited for some generations to recover from side effects of the antibiotics. Knowledge of potential long-term effects of the antibiotic is important. Here, we treated Drosophila nigrosparsa with and without antibiotic tetracycline for three generations and two generations recovering time to investigate effects of the tetracycline on the flies concerning locomotion of larvae and adults, wing morphology, and gut microbiome of adults. In addition, gut-microbiome restoration was tested as a solution to reducing potential side effects of tetracycline on the flies microbiome more quickly. We found significant differences in larval and adult locomotion within groups but no significant differences among the control, antibiotic-treated, and gut-restoration groups. We found a slight differentiation of wing morphology into the three groups and significant differences in bacterial abundance among groups. The influence of tetracycline on the gut microbiome may have contributed to wing-morphology differences among groups, which would be an indirect effect of the antibiotic. Together with the absence of an effect on locomotion, this suggests that checking for both direct and indirect effects of tetracycline after a particular recovery time before using tetracycline curing is important. The microbiome of the gut-restoration group was not like that of the control group. Therefore, gut restoration cannot be used to remove effects of tetracycline in D. nigrosparsa, at least in the setup used here.",

    "abstract": "Cellulose is a major component of the Salmonella biofilm extracellular matrix and it is considered an antivirulence factor because it interferes with Salmonella survival inside macrophages and virulence in mice. Its synthesis is stimulated by CsgD, the master regulator of biofilm extracellular matrix formation in enterobacteria, which in turn is under the control of MlrA, a MerR-like transcription factor. In this work we identified a SPI-2 encoded Salmonella-specific transcription factor homolog to MlrA, MlrB, that represses transcription of its downstream gene, STM1389, also known as orf319, and of csgD inside host cells. MlrB is induced in laboratory media mimicking intracellular conditions and inside macrophages, and it is required for intramacrophage survival. An increased expression of csgD is observed in the absence of MlrB inside host cells. Interestingly, inactivation of the CsgD-controlled cellulose synthase coding-gene, bcsA, restored intramacrophage survival to rates comparable to wild type bacteria in the absence of MlrB. These data indicate that MlrB represses CsgD expression inside host cells and in consequence activation of the cellulose synthase. Our findings provide a novel link between biofilm formation and Salmonella virulence.",

    "abstract": "Spermatogenesis involves coordinated processes, including meiosis, to produce functional gametes. We previously reported Topaz1 as a germ cell-specific gene highly conserved in vertebrates. Topaz1 knockout males are sterile with testes that lack haploid germ cells because of meiotic arrest after prophase I. To better characterize Topaz1-/- testes, we used RNA-sequencing analyses at two different developmental stages (P16 and P18). The absence of TOPAZ1 disturbed the expression of genes involved in microtubule and/or cilium mobility, which was consistent with testicular histology showing the disruption of microtubules and centrosomes. Moreover, a quarter of P18 dysregulated genes are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and three of them are testis-specific and located in spermatocytes, their expression starting between P11 and P15. The suppression of one of them, 4939463O16Rik, did not alter fertility although sperm parameters were disturbed and sperm concentration fell. The transcriptome of P18-4939463O16Rik-/- testes was altered and the molecular pathways affected included microtubule-based processes, the regulation of cilium movement and spermatogenesis. The absence of TOPAZ1 protein or 4930463O16Rik produced the same enrichment clusters in mutant testes despite a contrasted phenotype on male fertility. In conclusion, TOPAZ1 appeared to stabilize the expression of numerous lncRNAs. Its suppression is not essential for fertility but required during the terminal differentiation of male gametes.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe Topaz1 gene was initially characterized during the initiation of meiosis in the sheep fetal ovary. In order to determine its function, a KO of the murine gene was performed. In this species, only males were sterile and spermatogenesis was blocked before the first meiotic division. Here, we show that cytoskeletal elements are markedly disturbed in mutant testes, indicating that these elements play an important function in spermatogenesis. While the mitotic spindle of spermatogonia was normal, the meiotic spindle of spermatocytes was hemi-spindle-shaped and the homologous chromosome pairs could position themselves on the equatorial plate. In addition, lncRNAs account for 25% of genes whose expression in testes varies significantly in the absence of Topaz1. This suggests a key role for these factors in spermatogenesis. Largely testis-specific, they may be involved in spermatogenesis and play a more or less critical role in mouse fertility, which probably also depends on their redundancies.",

    "abstract": "Photoreceptor outer segments projecting from the surface of the neural retina toward the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are surrounded by a carbohydrate-rich matrix, the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) [1,2]. This extracellular compartment is necessary for physiological retinal function. However, specific roles for molecules characterizing the IPM have not been clearly defined [3]. Recent studies have found the presence of nonsense mutations in the interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 2 (IMPG2) gene in patients affected by autosomal recessive Retinitis Pigmentosa (arRP) [4,5] and autosomal dominant and recessive vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD) [6,7]. The gene encodes for a proteoglycan synthesized by photoreceptors and secreted in the IPM. However, little is known about the function and structure of this protein. We used the teleost zebrafish (D.rerio) as a model to study IMPG2 expression both during development and in adulthood, as its retina is very similar in humans [8]. In zebrafish, there are two IMPG2 proteins, IMPG2a and IMPG2b. We generated a phylogenetic tree based on IMPG2 protein sequence similarity among different vertebrate species, showing a significant similarity despite the evolutionary distance between humans and teleosts. In fact, human IMPG2 and D.rerio IMPG2a and IMPG2b share conserved SEA and EGF-like domains. Homology models of these domains were obtained by using the iTasser server. Finally, expression analyses of impg2a and impg2b during development and in the adult fish showed expression of both mRNAs starting from 3 days post fertilization (dpf) in the outer nuclear layer of zebrafish retina that continues throughout adulthood. This data lays the groundwork for the generation of novel and most needed animal models for the study of IMPG2-related inherited retinal dystrophies.",

    "abstract": "L1CAMs are immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecules that play important roles in the development and function of the nervous system. In addition to being associated with autism and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, impaired L1CAM function also underlies the X-linked L1 syndrome, which encompasses a group of neurological conditions, including spastic paraplegia and congenital hydrocephalus. Previous studies on both vertebrate and invertebrate L1CAMs established conserved roles that include axon guidance, dendrite morphogenesis, synapse development, and maintenance of neural architecture. We previously identified a genetic interaction between the C. elegans L1CAM encoded by the sax-7 gene and RAB-3, a GTPase that functions in synaptic neurotransmission; rab-3; sax-7 animals exhibit synthetic locomotion abnormalities and neuronal dysfunction. In this study, we examine the significance of this genetic interaction and show that this synergism also occurs when loss of SAX-7 is combined with mutants of other genes encoding key players of the synaptic vesicle cycle. In contrast, sax-7 does not interact with genes that function in synaptogenesis. These findings suggest a post-developmental role for sax-7 in the regulation of synaptic activity. To further assess this possibility, we conducted electrophysiological recordings and ultrastructural analyses at neuromuscular junctions. Lastly, we performed a forward genetic screen for suppressors of the rab-3; sax-7 synthetic phenotypes, uncovering a role for the Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway in promoting coordinated locomotion.",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and its end products, the glucocorticoids, are critical to responding appropriately to stressors. Subsequently, many studies have sought relationships between glucocorticoids and measures of health or fitness, but such relationships are at best highly context dependent. Recently, some endocrinologists have started to suggest that a focus on HPA flexibility, the ability of an individual to mount appropriate responses to different stressors, could be useful. Here, we tested the hypothesis that expression of FKBP5, a cochaperone in the glucocorticoid receptor complex, is a simple and reliable proxy of HPA flexibility in a wild songbird, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus). We quantified HPA flexibility in a novel way, using guidance from research on heart rhythm regulation. As predicted, we found that adult sparrows with low stress-induced FKBP5 expression in the hypothalamus exhibited high HPA flexibility. Moreover, low FKBP5 expression was associated with better stress coping capacities in terms of exploratory disposition and body mass maintenance. Altogether, these results suggest that FKBP5 may be important in the regulation HPA flexibility, potentially affecting how individuals cope with natural and anthropogenic adversity.",

    "abstract": "Disease lesion mimic mutants (DLMMs) are characterized by spontaneous development of necrotic spots with various phenotypes designated as necrotic (nec) mutants in barley. The nec mutants were traditionally considered to have aberrant regulation of programmed cell death (PCD) pathways, which have roles in plant immunity and development. Most barley nec3 mutants express cream to orange necrotic lesions contrasting them from typical spontaneous DLMMs that develop dark pigmented lesions indicative of serotonin/phenolics deposition. Also, barley nec3 mutants grown under sterile conditions did not exhibit necrotic phenotypes until inoculated with adapted pathogens suggesting that they are not typical DLMMs. The F2 progeny of a cross between nec3-{gamma}1 and variety Quest segregated as a single recessive gene post inoculation with Bipolaris sorokiniana, the causal agent of the disease spot blotch. Nec3 was genetically delimited to 0.14 cM representing 16.5 megabases of physical sequence containing 149 annotated high confidence genes. RNAseq and comparative analysis of wild type and five independent nec3 mutants identified a single candidate cytochrome P450 gene (HORVU.MOREX.r2.6HG0460850) that was validated as nec3 by independent mutations that result in predicted nonfunctional proteins. Histology studies determined that nec3 mutants had an unstable cutin layer that disrupted normal Bipolaris sorokiniana germ tube development.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYAt the site of pathogen infection, plant defense mechanisms rely on controlled programmed cell death (PCD) to sequester biotrophic pathogens that require living cells to extract nutrient from the host. However, these defense mechanisms are hijacked by necrotrophic plant pathogens that purposefully induce PCD mechanism to feed from the dead cells facilitating further disease development. Thus, understanding PCD responses is important for resistance to both classes of pathogens. We characterized five independent disease lesion mimic mutants of barley designated necrotic 3 (nec3) that show aberrant regulation of PCD responses upon pathogen challenge. A cytochrome P450 gene was identified as Nec3 encoding a Tryptamine 5-Hydroxylase that functions as a terminal serotonin biosynthetic enzyme in the Tryptophan pathway of plants. The nec3 mutants have disrupted serotonin biosynthesis resulting in expansive PCD, necrotrophic pathogen susceptibility and cutin layer instability. The nec3 mutants lacking serotonin deposition in pathogen induced necrotic lesions show expansive PCD and disease susceptibility suggesting a role of serotonin to sequester PCD and suppress pathogen colonization. The identification of Nec3 will facilitate functional analysis to elucidate the role serotonin plays in the elicitation or suppression of PCD immunity responses to diverse pathogens and effects it has on cutin layer biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Horsegram (Macrotyloma uniflorum) is a drought hardy legume which can be grown in varied soil and temperature regime. It is an important food legume with environmental, nutritive and medicinal benefits. But in terms of genetic improvement it still lags behind other legumes. To get insight into the genetics of tolerance to drought stress, quantitative trait loci for drought tolerance traits were identified using an intraspecific mapping population comprising of 162 F8 Recombinant Inbred Lines derived from a cross between HPKM249 and HPK4. A total of 2011 markers were screened on parental lines for polymorphism survey, out of which 493 markers were found to be polymorphic and used for genotyping of the RIL population. Of these 493 polymorphic markers, 295 were assigned to ten linkage groups at LOD 3.5 spanning 1541.7cM with a mean distance of 5.20 cM between adjacent markers. This linkage map along with the phenotypic data for drought tolerance traits was used to identify regions of the horsegram genome in which the genes for the qualitative traits linked to drought tolerance located. A total of seven QTLs were identified for six different drought related traits. One QTL for malondialdehyde content on linkage group 2, two QTLs for root length on linkage group 3 & 9, one QTL each for proline content and chlorophyll content under drought stress on linkage group 4, one QTL each for root dry weight and root fresh weight on linkage group 5 were identified using composite interval mapping. The linkage map and identified QTLs will be utilized in Marker Assisted Breeding and increase our understanding on the physiology of drought stress tolerance. It will also aid in molecular breeding efforts for further genetic improvement of horsegram.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequent cause of bronchiolitis in children under five years of age. No vaccines against this virus are currently available. RSV infection of a cell is initiated by fusion between the virion membrane and a cellular membrane, but it is not clear if the fusion process takes place at the plasma membrane or within an endosome. Most such experiments have been initiated at the traditional synchronization temperature of 4{degrees}C, an abnormal temperature for animal cells and one at which cellular homeostasis may be negatively affected. We have compared two synchronization temperatures (4{degrees}C and 22{degrees}C) to determine the kinetics of RSV entry into human bronchial epithelial cells. Following inoculation, virus entry was halted at different times by the addition of neutralizing antibody or temperature reduction to 4{degrees}C. We engineered a virus that encodes an extra viral gene, beta-lactamase fused to the viral phosphoprotein (P), to enable rapid detection after infection initiation. We found that the synchronization temperature used during inoculation determines the site of fusion. Transition from 4{degrees}C to 37{degrees}C resulted in RSV entry via the endosomal pathway but also induced F-actin disruption and plasma membrane blebbing, whether the cells were inoculated with RSV or not. Transition from 22{degrees}C to 37{degrees}C resulted in RSV entry by fusion at the plasma membrane and without the F-actin and plasma membrane disruptions. These results suggest that RSV normally enters cells by fusion at the plasma membrane and that the induction of endocytosis by infection synchronization at 4{degrees}C may be an artefact caused by distortion of the plasma membrane-supporting cytoskeleton.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn order to understand the overall mechanism driving infection, it is important to determine how the virus enters cells. The pathway that RSV uses to infect cells is unclear. It is a common practice to attach the virions at 4{degrees}C to synchronize the viral infection. In this report, we found that warming up primary cultures of undifferentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells to 37{degrees}C from 4{degrees}C triggered dramatic changes in their cell membrane and cytoskeleton totally unrelated to the presence of the virions. The assessment of viral content delivery to the cytoplasm using RSV engineered to express BlaM allowed us to find that the virions attached at 4{degrees}C or 22{degrees}C fused their envelope with endosome or plasma membrane, respectively. Consequently, the entry via endosome after attachment at 4{degrees}C is an experimental artefact and RSV infects by fusing its envelope with the plasma membrane. The implications go beyond RSV since the entry of several virus species have been explored by synchronizing the infection after attachment at 4{degrees}C.",

Sample collection was performed in habitats of P. juliflora thicket, P. juliflora mixed with native species stands, non-invaded woodlands, and open grazing lands. A stratified random sampling technique was used for data collection. Among species of plants, the highest proportion of species, 87 (27.4%), was recorded under non-invaded woodlands, but the lowest proportion of species, 70 (22%), was recorded under open grazing lands. The invasion level of P. juliflora caused significantly reduced Shannon diversity index. The mean values of Shannon diversity index and species richness under P. juliflora mixed with native species (H=2.22, R=14) and non-invaded woodlands (H=2.23, R=13) were significantly higher than P. juliflora thicket (H=1.96, R=12) and open grazing lands (H=1.84, R=10). In this study, 102 trees ha-1native woody species were recorded under P. juliflora thicket, but 1252 trees ha-1native species were recorded under non-invaded woodlands. If the present effects of the invasion of P. juliflora on native species diversity were to continue coupled with a drier climate, plant diversity of the Afar flora region will be highly affected. As a result the ecosystem services will be under threat. Thus, the participation of all stakeholders and multidisciplinary research approaches should be designed for the management of invaded rangelands to reverse the situation.",

The NEOtrap is formed by docking a DNA-origami sphere onto a passivated solid-state nanopore, which seals off a nanocavity of a user-defined size and creates an electro-osmotic flow that traps nearby particles irrespective of their charge. We demonstrate the NEOtraps ability to sensitively distinguish proteins based on size and shape, and discriminate nucleotide-dependent protein conformations, as exemplified by the chaperone protein Hsp90. Given the experimental simplicity and capacity for label-free single-protein detection over the broad bio-relevant time range, the NEOtrap opens new avenues to study the molecular kinetics underlying protein function.",

    "abstract": "Measles virus (MeV) is the most contagious human virus, but we do not fully understand why. Unlike most respiratory viruses, MeV does not infect the airway epithelium immediately. MeV traverses the epithelium within immune cells that carry it to lymphatic organs where amplification occurs. Infected immune cells then synchronously deliver large amounts of virus to the airways. However, our understanding of MeV replication in airway epithelia is limited. To model it, we use well-differentiated primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells (HAE) from lung donors. In HAE, MeV spreads directly cell-to-cell forming infectious centers that grow for [~]3-5 days, are stable for a few days, and then disappear. Transepithelial electrical resistance remains intact during the entire course of HAE infection, thus we hypothesized that MeV infectious centers may slough off while preserving epithelial function. After documenting by confocal microscopy that infectious centers progressively detach from HAE, we recovered apical washes and separated cell-associated from cell-free virus by centrifugation. Virus titers were about 10 times higher in the cell-associated fraction than in the supernatant. In sloughed infectious centers, ciliary beating persisted and apoptotic markers were not readily detected, suggesting that they retain functional metabolism. Cell-associated MeV infected primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, modeling the first stage of infection in a new host. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified wound healing, cell growth, and cell differentiation as biological processes relevant for infectious center sloughing. 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining located proliferating cells underneath infectious centers. Thus, cells located below infectious centers divide and differentiate to repair the extruded infected epithelial patch. As an extension of these studies, we postulate that expulsion of infectious centers through coughing and sneezing could contribute to MeVs strikingly high reproductive number by allowing the virus to survive longer in the environment and by delivering a high infectious dose to the next host.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMeasles virus (MeV) is a respiratory pathogen that infects millions worldwide each year. Although sometimes mischaracterized as an innocuous childhood disease, measles remains a leading cause of death for children under five. MeV is the most contagious human virus and requires vaccination rates above 90% to maintain herd immunity. Global decreases in vaccination rates over the past ten years contributed to recent, widespread MeV outbreaks. We uncover here a novel mechanism by which MeV exits the human airways that may explain why it is much more contagious than other viruses. We document that infected cells containing cell-associated virus slough en masse from the airway epithelial sheet. These expelled infectious centers are metabolically active and can transmit infection to primary human monocyte-derived macrophages more efficiently than cell-free virus particles. Thus, cell-associated MeV can transmit host-to-host, a new paradigm for efficient respiratory virus transmission.",

    "abstract": "Although a potent Yellow fever vaccine is available since 1937, up to 200.000 severe cases are reported per year, which indicates that virus vaccines require additional support by antiviral therapies. Direct-acting antiviral drugs against severe and widespread diseases, such as DENV and Yellow fever infections with more than millions of diagnosed diseases per year, are still not available. Since antivirals development against neglected diseases is uneconomical, a broadspectrum antiviral compound would be of public benefit. Here, we show that IMP-1088, a recently published myristoyltransferase-1/2 inhibitor suppressing Rhino- and Polioviruses, inhibits replication of HIV-1, Yellow fever virus, Dengue virus, Vaccinia virus, CMV, and human Herpesvirus 8 in the low nanomolar range, indicating that IMP-1088 has broad-range activity against different pathogenic virus families. The inhibition relies on virally encoded myristoylation signals since Zika, Chikungunya, and Enterovirus 71 are not affected by IMP-1088. Furthermore, we show that the Yellow fever NS5 protein is myristoylated and IMP-1088 treatment of Dengue and Yellow fever infected cells leads to a re-localisation of the viral NS5 proteins.\n\nAuthor SummaryTreatment of viral diseases requires the development of tailored drugs specific to inhibit certain virus families. This specificity results in missing treatment options for important human pathogens such as Yellow fever and Dengue virus infection since the development is laborious and costly. Substances acting on various virus families could solve this problem. Here, we describe that IMP-1088, an inhibitor of the cellular myristoyltransferase, inhibits HIV-1, Dengue virus, Yellow fever viruses, Vaccinia virus, and Herpesviruses at low concentrations, which do not affect cell proliferation. Viruses without predicated myristoylation sites, such as Zika viruses, were not inhibited by IMP-1088. Since no experimental evidence was provided that Yellow fever virus proteins are myristoylated, we analysed the post-translational modification of Yellow fever NS5 protein. We determined the subcellular localisation to understand the mechanism of the IMP-1088 mediated suppression and could show that both the Dengue and the Yellow fever NS5 proteins are re-localised by IMP-1088 treatment.",

High exposure to microplastic fibers in nylon flock workers has been linked to the development of airway and interstitial lung disease, but the exact health effects of microplastic fibers on the lungs are unknown. Here we determined effects of polyester and nylon textile microplastic fibers on airway and alveolar epithelial cells using human and murine lung organoids. We observed that particularly nylon microfibers had a negative impact on the growth and development of airway organoids. We demonstrated that this effect was mediated by components leaking from nylon.

In the absence of Atrx, irradiated sarcomas have increased persistent DNA damage, telomere dysfunction, and mitotic catastrophe. We find that Atrx deleted sarcomas have a reduced adaptive immune response, impaired cGAS-STING signaling, and increased sensitivity to an oncolytic herpesvirus therapy.

The Kirrel receptors are believed to homodimerize via their ectodomains and help separate sensory neuron axons into Kirrel2- or Kirrel3-expressing glomeruli. Here we present the crystal structures of homodimeric Kirrel receptors and show that the closely related Kirrel2 and Kirrel3 have evolved specific sets of polar and hydrophobic interactions, respectively, disallowing heterodimerization while preserving homodimerization, likely resulting in proper segregation and coalescence of Kirrel-expressing axons into glomeruli. We show that the dimerization interface at the N-terminal IG domains is necessary and sufficient to create homodimers, and fail to find evidence for a secondary interaction site in Kirrel ectodomains. Furthermore, we show that abolishing dimerization of Kirrel3 in vivo leads to improper formation of glomeruli in the mouse accessory olfactory bulb as observed in Kirrel3-/- animals.

    "abstract": "Anxiety influences how the brain estimates and responds to uncertainty. These behavioural effects have been described within predictive coding and Bayesian inference frameworks, yet the associated neural correlates remain unclear. Recent work suggests that predictions in generative models of perception are represented in alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta oscillations (13-30 Hz). Updates to predictions are driven by prediction errors weighted by precision (inverse variance; pwPE), and are encoded in gamma oscillations (>30 Hz) and associated with suppression of beta activity. We tested whether state anxiety alters the neural oscillatory activity associated with predictions and pwPE during learning. Healthy human participants performed a probabilistic reward-learning task in a volatile environment. In our previous work, we described learning behaviour in this task using a hierarchical Bayesian model, revealing more precise (biased) beliefs about the reward tendency in state anxiety, consistent with reduced learning in this group. The model provided trajectories of predictions and pwPEs for the current study, allowing us to assess their parametric effects on the time-frequency representations of EEG data. Using convolution modelling for oscillatory responses, we found that, relative to a control group, state anxiety increased beta activity in frontal and sensorimotor regions during processing of pwPE, and in fronto-parietal regions during encoding of predictions. No effects of state anxiety on gamma modulation were found. Our findings expand prior evidence on the oscillatory representations of predictions and pwPEs into the reward-learning domain. The results suggest that state anxiety modulates beta-band oscillatory correlates of pwPE and predictions in generative models, providing insights into the neural processes associated with biased belief updating and poorer reward learning.",

    "abstract": "Palms (family Arecaceae) are conspicuous and structural elements in forests ecosystems of tropical regions and mountain forests in South America. Additionally, many species of palms are culturally and economically important to human populations. Because of their ecological and ethnobotanical significance, understanding the drivers of palm distribution and diversity is critical. However, most past research has focused in tropical lowland palm communities, while our understanding of montane tropical palm ecology and biogeography is comparatively lacking. We investigate the environmental factors that influence patterns of richness, composition, and abundance of palms in the Central Andes. In particular, we are interested in the relative effects that soil edaphic conditions and climate have on palm community structure. For these analyses, we used a network of 88 forest plots distributed along a broad elevational gradient (1,000 - 3,200 meters), which are part of the Madidi Project in north-western Bolivia. We carried out palm community-level analysis, as well as species-specific analyses for each of the 16 most common species. We found that soils and climate contribute differentially to shaping Andean palm diversity and distributions. We found that soils explain more variation in species composition (14.4%) than climate (3.45%), but that climate explains more variation in species richness (13%) than soils (6.1%). Moreover, species-specific analyses reveal that there is great variation in how different common species respond to their abiotic environment. Our results contribute to understanding the drivers of biodiversity for a highly important group of plants in one of the most important hotspots for biodiversity.\n\nRESUMENEn el neotropico, las palmeras (Arecaceae) son un grupo diverso y abundante de plantas que constituyen elementos estructurales en bosques tropicales tanto de tierras bajas como de montana.

We provide evidence that ColXVIII has a specific role in kidney ontogenesis by regulating the interaction between mesenchymal and epithelial tissues as observed in analyses of total and isoform-specific knockout embryos, mice, and ex vivo organ primordia. ColXVIII deficiency, both temporally and spatially, impacts the 3D pattern of ureteric tree branching morphogenesis via its specific isoforms. Proper development of ureteric tree depends on a tight control of the nephron progenitor cells (NPCs). ColXVIII-deficient NPCs are leaving the NPC pool faster than in controls. Moreover, the data suggests that ColXVIII mediates the kidney epithelial tree patterning via its N-terminal domains, and especially the Thrombospondin-1-like domain, and that this morphogenetic effect involves ureteric epithelial integrins. Altogether, the results propose a significant role for ColXVIII in a complex signalling network regulating renal progenitors and kidney development.",

    "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila is a ubiquitous freshwater pathogen and the causative agent of Legionnaires disease. This pathogen and its ability to cause disease is closely tied to its environmental encounters. From phagocytic protists, L. pneumophila has \"learned\" how to avoid predation and exploit conserved eukaryotic processes to establish an intracellular replicative niche. Legionnaires disease is a product of these evolutionary pressures as L. pneumophila uses the same molecular mechanisms to replicate in grazing protists and in macrophages of the human lung. L. pneumophila growth within protists also provides a refuge from desiccation, disinfection, and other remediation strategies. One outstanding question has been whether this protection extends to phages. L. pneumophila isolates are remarkably devoid of prophages and to date no Legionella phages have been identified. Nevertheless, many L. pneumophila isolates maintain active CRISPR-Cas defenses. So far, the only known target of these systems has been an episomal element that we previously named Legionella Mobile Element-1 (LME-1). In this study, we have identified over 150 CRISPR-Cas systems across 600 isolates, to establish the clearest picture yet of L. pneumophilas adaptive defenses. By leveraging the sequence of 1,500 unique spacers, we can make two main conclusions: current data argue against CRISPR-Cas targeted integrative elements beyond LME-1 and the heretofore \"missing\" L. pneumophila phages are most likely lytic gokushoviruses.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe causative agent of Legionnaires disease, an often-fatal pneumonia, is an intracellular bacterium, Legionella pneumophila, that normally grows inside amoebae and other freshwater protists. Unfortunately for us, this has two major consequences: the bacterium can take what it has learned in amoebae and use similar strategies to grow inside our lungs; and these amoebae can protect Legionella from various forms of chemical and physical disinfection regimes. Legionella are ubiquitous in the environment and frequently found in man-made water systems. Understanding the challenges to Legionella survival before it reaches the human lung is critical to preventing disease.\n\nWe have leveraged our earlier discovery that L. pneumophila CRISPR-Cas systems are active and adaptive - meaning that they respond to contemporary threats encountered in the environment. In this way, CRISPR arrays can be considered genomic diaries of past encounters, with spacer sequences used to identify elements that may impinge on the pathogens survival. One outstanding question in the field is whether L. pneumophila is susceptible to phage, given the presumptive protection provided by intracellular replication within its eukaryotic hosts. In this work, we use CRISPR spacer sequences to suggest that the heretofore \"missing\" L. pneumophila phage are most likely lytic gokushoviruses. Such information is critical to the long-term goal of developing of new strategies for preventing colonization of our water systems by Legionella and subsequent human exposure to the pathogen.",

    "abstract": "One promising approach towards understanding what makes sleep vulnerable in disease is to look at how wake-promoting mechanisms affect healthy sleep. Wake-promoting neuronal activity is inhibited during non-REM sleep (NREMS). However, many mammalian species, including humans, show recurrent moments of sleep fragility during which sensory reactivity is elevated. Wake-related neuronal activity could thus remain active in NREMS, but its roles in dynamic variations of sensory reactivity remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mouse NREMS is a brain state with recurrent fluctuations of the wake-promoting neurotransmitter noradrenaline on the [~]50-seconds time-scale. These fluctuations occurred around mean noradrenaline levels greater than the ones of quiet wakefulness, while they declined steeply in REMS. They coincided with a clustering of sleep spindle rhythms in the forebrain and with heart rate variations. We addressed the origins of these fluctuations by using closed-loop optogenetic locus coeruleus (LC) activation or inhibition timed to moments of low and high spindle activity during NREMS. We could suppress, lock or entrain sleep spindle clustering or heart rate variations, demonstrating that both fore- and hindbrain-projecting LC neurons show synchronized infraslow activity variations in natural NREMS. Noradrenergic modulation of thalamic but not cortical circuits was required for sleep spindle clustering and involved noradrenaline release into primary sensory and reticular thalamic nuclei that activated both 1- and {beta}-adrenergic receptors to cause slowly decaying membrane depolarizations. Noradrenergic signaling by LC, primarily known for attention promotion in wakefulness, renders mammalian NREMS more  wake-like on the close-to-minute-time scale through sustaining thalamocortical and autonomic sensory arousability.",

    "abstract": "The karyotype of most birds has remained considerably stable during more than 100 million years evolution, except for some groups, such as parrots. The evolutionary processes and underlying genetic mechanism of chromosomal rearrangements in parrots, however, are poorly understood. Here, using chromosome-level assemblies of three parrot genomes (monk parakeet, blue-fronted amazon, budgerigar), we uncovered frequent chromosome fusions and fissions among parrots, with most of them being lineage-specific. In particular, at least 12 chromosomes recurrently experienced inter-chromosomal fusions in different parrot lineages. Two conserved vertebrate genes, ALC1 and PARP3, with known functions in the repair of double-strand breaks and maintenance of genome stability, were specifically lost in parrots. The loss of ALC1 was associated with multiple deletions and an accumulation of CR1-psi, a novel subfamily of transposable elements (TEs) that recently amplified in parrots, while the loss of PARP3 was associated with an inversion. Additionally, the fusion of the ZW sex chromosomes and chromosome 11 has created a pair of neo-sex chromosomes in the ancestor of parrots, and the chromosome 25 has been further added to the sex chromosomes in monk parakeet. The newly formed neo-sex chromosomes were validated by our chromosomal painting, genomic and phylogenetic analyses. Transcriptome profiling for multiple tissues of males and females did not reveal signals of female-specific selection driving the formation of neo-sex chromosomes. Finally, we identified one W-specific satellite repeat that contributed to the unusual enlargement of the W chromosome in monk parakeet. Together, the combination of our genomic and cytogenetic analyses highlight the role of TEs and genetic drift in promoting chromosome rearrangements, gene loss and the evolution of neo-sex chromosome in parrots.",

    "abstract": "While the promise of electronic medical record and biobank data is large, major questions remain about patient privacy, computational hurdles, and data access. One promising area of recent development is pre-computing non-individually identifiable summary statistics to be made publicly available for exploration and downstream analysis. In this manuscript we demonstrate how to utilize pre-computed linear association statistics between individual genetic variants and phenotypes to infer genetic relationships between products of phenotypes (e.g., ratios; logical combinations of binary phenotypes using  and and  or) with customized covariate choices. We propose a method to approximate covariate adjusted linear models for products and logical combinations of phenotypes using only pre-computed summary statistics. We evaluate our methods accuracy through several simulation studies and an application modeling various fatty acid ratios using data from the Framingham Heart Study. These studies show consistent ability to recapitulate analysis results performed on individual level data including maintenance of the Type I error rate, power, and effect size estimates. An implementation of this proposed method is available in the publicly available R package pcsstools.",

    "abstract": "In the honey bee (Apis mellifera), queen and worker castes originate from identical genetic templates but develop into different phenotypes. Queens lay up to 2,000 eggs daily whereas workers are sterile in the queens presence. Periodically queens stop laying; during swarming, when resources are scarce in winter and when they are confined to a cage by beekeepers. We used confocal microscopy and gene expression assays to investigate the control of oogenesis in honey bee queen ovaries. We show that queens use different combination of  checkpoints to regulate oogenesis compared to honey bee workers and other insect species. However, both queen and worker castes use the same programmed cell death pathways to terminate oocyte development at their caste-specific checkpoints. Our results also suggest that the termination of oogenesis in queens is driven by nutritional stress. Thus, queens may regulate oogenesis via the same regulatory pathways that were utilised by ancestral solitary species but have adjusted physiological checkpoints to suit their highly-derived life history.\n\nSummary statementHoney bee queens regulate oogenesis using a different combination of  checkpoints to workers, but both castes use the same molecular pathways.",

Here we performed a standard DNA extraction from a single, field-collected Formica aquilonia x Formica polyctena haploid male and assembled its genome using [~]60x of PacBio long reads. After polishing and contaminant removal, the final assembly was 272 Mb (4,687 contigs, N50 = 1.16 Mb). Our reference genome contains 98.5% of the core Hymenoptera BUSCOs and was scaffolded using the pseudo-chromosomal assembly of a related species, F. selysi (28 scaffolds, N50 = 8.49 Mb). Around one third of the genome consists of repeats, and 17,426 gene models were annotated using both protein and RNAseq data (97.4% BUSCO completeness). This resource is of comparable quality to the few other single individual insect genomes assembled to date and paves the way to genomic studies of admixture in natural populations and comparative genomic approaches in Formica wood ants.",

    "abstract": "The Internet has changed the way teachers and students access information and build knowledge. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has created challenges for both teachers and students and a demand for new methodologies of remote learning. In the life sciences, mixing online content with practical activities represents an even greater challenge. In microbiology, the implementation of an active teaching methodology, the #Adopt project, based on the social network Facebook(R), represents an excellent option for connecting remote education with classroom activities. In 2020, the version applied in high school, \"Adopt a Microorganism\", was adapted to meet the demands of emergency remote education owing to the suppression of face-to-face activities caused by the pandemic. In the present study, we assessed how the change in methodology impacted the discourse richness of students from high school integrated with technical education in the Business Administration program of the Federal Institute of Sao Paulo, Sorocaba Campus. Three questionnaires related to the groups of microorganisms (Archaea, Bacteria, Virus, Fungi, and Protozoan) were applied. The students responses in the 2019 and 2020 classes were compared concerning content richness and multiplicity of concepts through the application of the Shannon diversity index, an approach that is generally used to assess biodiversity in different environments. The observed results suggest that remote learning provided students with a conceptual basis and richness of content equivalent to that achieved by students subjected to the hybrid teaching model. In conclusion, this study suggests that the #Adopt project methodology increases students discourse richness in microbiology even without face-to-face traditional classes.",
