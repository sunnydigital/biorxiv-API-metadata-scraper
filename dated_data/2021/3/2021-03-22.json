    "abstract": "The first aim of the study was to verify if in individuals with different physical fitness levels the Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) time series could be an alternative to Gas Exchange (GE) analysis in the determination of metabolic thresholds. The second aim was to investigate the validity of the RQA method compared to the GE method in thresholds detection. The two metabolic thresholds were estimated in thirty young individuals during Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing on a cycle-ergometer and HR, VO2 and Workload were measured by the two different methods (RQA and GE methods). RM ANOVA was used to assess main effects of methods and methods-by-groups interaction effects for HR, VO2 and Workload at the aerobic (AerT) and the anaerobic (AnT) thresholds. Validity of the RQA at both thresholds was assessed for HR, VO2 and Workload by Ordinary Least Products (OLP) regression analysis, Typical Percentage Errors (TE), Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and the Bland Altman plots. No methods-by-groups interaction effects were detected for HR, VO2 and Workload at the AerT and the AnT. The OLP regression analysis showed that at both thresholds RQA and GE methods had very strong correlations (r >0.8) in all variables (HR, VO2 and Workload). Slope and intercept values always included the 1 and the 0, respectively. At the AerT the TE ranged from 4.02% to 10.47% (HR and Workload, respectively) and in all variables ICC values were excellent ([&ge;]0.85). At the AnT the TE ranged from 2.61% to 6.64% (HR and Workload, respectively) and in all variables ICC values were excellent ([&ge;]0.89). Our results suggest that the RQA of HRV time series is a COVID-safe approach for the determination of metabolic thresholds in individuals with different physical fitness levels, therefore, it can be used as a valid method for threshold detection alternative to gas analysis.",

    "abstract": "The effects of urbanization on watershed ecosystems present critical challenges to modern survival. Organisms in urbanized areas experience high rates of evolutionary change, but genetic adaptation alone cannot mitigate the rapid and severe effects of urbanization on biodiversity. Highly resilient, foundation species are key to maintaining an ecosystems integrity in the face of urban stressors. However, the rapid collapse and disappearance of watershed ecosystems calls into question the extent to which we can rely on such species for their services. Our research investigates the molecular mechanisms by which the foundation ecosystems provider, Sporobolus alterniflorus, adapts to life in an urbanized environment. To elucidate these mechanisms, we quantified changes in global DNA methylation (% 5-mC) as a result of acute heat stress. Specimens from two differentially impacted populations across an urban to suburban geographical transect formed the basis of this study. These two populations of Sporobolus alterniflora exhibit inverse global DNA methylation patterns when exposed to the same acute heat stress. Our findings suggest that epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, control rapid and transient adaptation, in the form of differential stress responses, to distinct environment challenges.\n\nHighlights for manuscript submissionO_LI{blacksquare} estuarine grasses native to the Bronx River, NY face stresses associated with low dissolved oxygen and urbanization\nC_LIO_LI{blacksquare} differentially impacted populations of estuarine grasses exhibit inverse global DNA methylation profiles in response to acute heat stress\nC_LIO_LI{blacksquare} DNA methylation may represent a mechanism by which plants transiently respond to environmental stressors, and this may represent a form of rapid adaptive evolution\nC_LIO_LI{blacksquare} stress priming by transgenerational epigenetic modification may enhance fitness in grasses native to the heavily impacted Bronx River estuary\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Individuals can be characterized in a population according to their brain measurements and activity, given the inter-subject variability in brain anatomy, structure-function relationships, or life experience. Many neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the potential of functional network connectivity patterns estimated from resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to discriminate groups and predict information about individual subjects. However, the predictive signal present in the spatial heterogeneity of brain connectivity networks is yet to be extensively studied. In this study, we investigate, for the first time, the use of pairwise-relationships between resting-state independent spatial maps to characterize individuals. To do this, we develop a deep Siamese framework comprising three-dimensional convolution neural networks for contrastive learning based on individual-level spatial maps estimated via a fully automated fMRI independent component analysis approach. The proposed framework evaluates whether pairs of spatial networks (e.g., visual network and auditory network) are capable of subject identification and assesses the spatial variability in different network pairs predictive power in an extensive whole-brain analysis. Our analysis on nearly 12,000 unaffected individuals from the UK Biobank study demonstrates that the proposed approach can discriminate subjects with an accuracy of up to 88% for a single network pair on the test set (best model, after several runs), and 82% average accuracy at the subcortical domain level, notably the highest average domain level accuracy attained. Further investigation of our networks learned features revealed a higher spatial variability in predictive accuracy among younger brains and significantly higher discriminative power among males. In sum, the relationship among spatial networks appears to be both informative and discriminative of individuals and should be studied further as putative brain-based biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Arenavirus entry into host cells occurs through a low pH-dependent fusion with late endosomes that is mediated by the viral glycoprotein complex (GPC). The mechanisms of GPC-mediated membrane fusion and of virus targeting to late endosomes are not well understood. To gain insights into arenavirus fusion, we examined cell-cell fusion induced by the Old World Lassa virus (LASV) GPC complex. LASV GPC-mediated cell fusion is more efficient and occurs at higher pH in cells expressing human LAMP1 compared to cells lacking this cognate receptor, but this receptor is not absolutely required for virus entry. GPC-induced fusion progresses through the same lipid intermediates as fusion mediated by other viral glycoproteins - a lipid curvature-sensitive intermediate upstream of hemifusion and a hemifusion intermediate downstream of acid-dependent steps that can be arrested in the cold. Importantly, GPC-mediated fusion is specifically augmented by an anionic lipid, bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), which is highly enriched in late endosomes. We show that BMP promotes late steps of LASV fusion downstream of hemifusion - the formation and enlargement of fusion pores. This lipid also specifically promotes cell fusion mediated by GPC of the unrelated New World Junin arenavirus. The BMP-dependence of post-hemifusion stages of arenavirus fusion suggests that these viruses evolved to use this lipid as a cofactor to direct virus entry to late endosomes.\n\nAuthor SummaryPathogenic arenaviruses pose a serious health threat. The viral envelope glycoprotein GPC mediates attachment to host cells and drives virus entry via endocytosis and low pH-dependent fusion within late endosomes. Understanding the host factors and processes that are essential for arenavirus fusion may identify novel therapeutic targets. To delineate the mechanism of arenavirus entry, we examined cell-cell fusion induced by the Old World Lassa virus GPC proteins at low pH. Lassa virus fusion was augmented by the LAMP1 receptor and progressed through lipid curvature-sensitive intermediates, such as hemifusion (merger of contacting leaflets of viral and cell membrane without the formation of a fusion pore). We found that most GPC-mediated fusion events were off-path hemifusion structures and that the transition from hemifusion to full fusion and fusion pore enlargement were specifically promoted by an anionic lipid, bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, which is highly enriched in late endosomes. This lipid also specifically promotes fusion of unrelated New World Junin arenavirus. Our results imply that arenaviruses evolved to use bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate to enter cells from late endosomes.",

    "abstract": "Phormidium lacuna, a filamentous cyanobacterium without heterocysts, can be transformed by natural transformation. These filaments are motile on agar and other surfaces and display rapid lateral movements in liquid culture. Furthermore, they exhibit phototactic response under vertical illumination in Petri dishes. We generated mutants in which a KanR resistance cassette was integrated in the phytochrome gene cphA and in various genes of the type IV pilin apparatus. pilM, pilN, pilQ and pilT mutants were defective in all three responses, indicating that type IV pili are involved in all three kinds of motility. Rapid movements of wild type in liquid culture requires an extracellular matrix with type IV pili as central player. pilB mutants are only partially blocked in their responses. pilB is the proposed ATPase for expelling of the filament. In the mutant, this function could be overtaken by an alternative protein, like pilT, which regularly mediates retraction of pili. The cphA mutant revealed a significantly reduced phototactic response towards red light. We assume that together with other photoreceptors, CphA regulates the phototactic response by down regulation of surface attachment.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveGlucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78) has been regarded as a main member of the endoplasmic reticulum proteins, Grp78 could protect cells from apoptosis under stress conditions. However, whether Grp78 could protect retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells from oxidative injury and then protect retinas from morphological changes and functional abnormalities remain undetermined. Here, we try to explore the effect of Grp78 on retinal cell injury induced by sodium iodate in vivo and in vitro.\n\nMethodsTo investigate whether Grp78 has a protective effect on RPE injury in vitro, human retinal pigment epithelium (ARPE-19) cells were treated with sodium iodate. The cell proliferation, morphology, apoptosis and ROS production assays were detected. In vivo, We established sodium iodate-induced retinal injury model in mice by intravenous injection of sodium iodate into tail vein. After that, we examined the morphology and function of retina in mice by fundus photography, OCT and ERG. Finally, we removed the retina of mice for histological examination.\n\nResultsGrp78 significantly inhibited sodium iodate-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), and decreased apoptosis of RPE in vitro. Furthermore, Grp78 significantly decreased the apoptosis of retinal cells in vivo, resulting in the inhibition of morphological changes of retina, and improving the function of retina. The underlying mechanisms included inhibited caspase3 and Nos, and increased expression of Bcl2, thereby protecting RPE from SI-induced ROS and apoptosis.\n\nConclusionGrp78 could reduce the injury of retinal cells induced by sodium iodate in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggested Grp78 may become a new therapeutic target for retinal injury in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Wheat is one of the high value important major crops of the globe. However, wheat stem rust is considered one of the determinant threats to wheat production in Ethiopia and the globe. So this study was conducted with the objective to assess disease intensity, seasonal distribution dynamics, and genetic variability and to determine virulence spectrum of stem rust in the irrigated wheat areas of Ethiopia. A total of 137 wheat farms were evaluated from 2014/15 - 2019/20 in six districts of Awash River basin. Farm plots were assessed every 5 - 10 km interval with  X fashion, and data on disease incidence, severity, and healthy plants were scored with diseased wheat plant samples collection for stem rust race analysis. The seasonal trend of wheat stem rust disease was also compared to see the future importance of the diseases. The result revealed that the prevalence, incidence, and severity of stem rust were significantly varied among the different districts and seasons in the two regions. The survey results also indicated that about 71.7% of the wheat fields were affected by stem rust during the 2018/19 growing season. The overall incidence and mean severity of the disease during the same season were 49.02% and 29.27%, respectively. During 2019/20 about 63.7% of the wheat fields were affected by stem rust, which, however, the incidence (30.97%) and severity (17.22%) were lower than the previous season. Although the seasonal disease distribution was decreased, its spatial distribution was expanding into Lower Awash. The physiological and the genetic race analysis identified four dominant races (TTTTF, TKTTF TKKTF, and TTKTF) during 2018/19 and additional race (TKPTF) during 2019/20. Thus races are highly virulent and affect most of the Sr genes except Sr - 31 and Sr - 24. TTTTF and TKKTF are the widest virulence spectrum which affects 90% of the Sr genes. Thus, it can be concluded that the spatial and seasonal distribution of the disease was expanding. Moreover, most of the races were similar with rain-fed production, and thus care must be given for effective management of the diseases to both agro-ecologies. Therefore, these findings provide inputs or insight for breeders to think about the breeding programs in their crossing lines and wheat producers to reduce the damage of the disease in the irrigated ecologies.\n\nETHICAL STATEMENTThus, surveys were conducted with the lateral aim of rust epidemics early warning and monitoring support program in the Awash River basin. Samples for this study were collected from farmers fields of the irrigated production areas in the Awash River basin. The disease was an air-borne disease that is difficult to contain. Still, we give maximum care during surveying through spore-free through self-sanitation after Pgt infested field observation to minimize induced disease dissemination to the communities in the production areas that no specific permissions were required for these locations. Field sites are on public access, and P. graminis f. sp. tritici is already an air-born pathogen that doesnt need special protection kinds. This work was our study experience in the endeavor in irrigated wheat technology dissemination.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of genetic purity of inbred lines and their resultant F1 hybrids is an essential quality control check in maize hybrid breeding, variety release and seed production. In this study, genetic purity, parent-offspring relationship and diversity among the inbred lines were assessed using 92 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. A total of 188 maize genotypes, comprising of 26 inbred lines, four doubled haploid (DH) lines and 158 single-cross maize hybrids were investigated in this study using Kompetitive Allele Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (KASP) genotyping assays. The bi-allelic data was analyzed for genetic purity and diversity parameters using GenAlex software. The SNP markers were highly polymorphic and 90% had polymorphic information content (PIC) values of > 0.3. Pairwise genetic distances among the lines ranged from 0.05 to 0.56, indicating a high level of dissimilarity among the inbred lines. Maximum genetic distance of (0.56) was observed for CKDHL0089, CML443 and CB323, while the lowest (0.05) was between I-42 and I-40. The majority (67%) of the inbred lines studied were genetically pure with residual heterozygosity of <5%, while only 33% were had heterozygosity levels of >5%. Inbred lines, which were not pure, require purification through further inbreeding. Cluster analysis partitioned the lines into three distinct genetic clusters with the potential to contribute new beneficial alleles to the maize breeding program. Out of the 68 hybrids (43%) that passed the parent-offspring test, seven hybrids namely; SCHP29, SCHP95, SCHP94, SCHP134, SCHP44, SCHP114 and SCHP126, were selected as potential candidates for further evaluation and release due to their outstanding yield performance.",

Thus, we aimed to study the risk factors associated with skin aging in the Mongolian population. A population-based cross-sectional study of 2720 study participants 18 years of age and older was performed evaluating the severity of skin aging based on cutaneous microtopography. Questionnaire data and skin physiological measurements were obtained. The odds ratios for skin aging grades associated with risk factors were estimated using ordinal logistic regression. Study participants mean age was 45 years, ranging from 18 to 87. After adjustment for known risk factors, skin aging was associated with demographic risk factors such as increasing age (aOR=1.19, 95% CI 1.18-1.20), living in an urban area (aOR=1.31, 95% CI 1.12-1.55) and working outside (aOR=1.44, 95% CI 0.88-2.39) and lifestyle factors including non-usage of sunscreen cream (aOR=1.09 95% CI 0.87-1.37), being a smoker (aOR=1.32, 95% CI 1.09-1.61), having a higher body mass index (BMI) (aOR=1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06) and higher levels of sun exposure time (aOR=1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06) were significantly associated with higher skin aging grades. Having dry (aOR=1.94, 95% CI 1.45-2.59) and combination skin (aOR=1.62, 95% CI 1.22-2.16) types were also independent risk factors associated with skin aging.

Older age, urban living, harsh working conditions, living in a ger district were independent demographic risk factors related to skin aging. Not using sunscreen cream, smoking, higher BMI, greater levels of sun exposure were significant lifestyle risk factors. Having a skin type other than normal was a physiologic risk factor for skin aging.",

A total of 3,969 potentially relevant papers were identified and processed for inclusion. After eligibility and study selection assessment, 24 studies were selected for meta-analysis, comprising a total of 3,012 participants. Meta-Essentials spreadsheet 1.4 (Microsoft Excel) was used in creating the forest plots and meta-analysis. IBM SPSS statistics V24 was implemented for the statistical analyses and the alpha was set at p [&le;] 0.05. 13 candidate genes and their associated alleles were identified, which were associated with the phenotypes of interest. Analysis of training group data showed significant differential phenotypic responses. Subgroup analysis showed; 44%, 72% and 10% of the response variance in aerobic, strength and power phenotypes, respectively, were explained by genetic influences. This analysis established that genetic variability explained a significant proportion of the adaptation differences across the three components of fitness in the participants post-training. The results also showed the importance of analysing and reporting specific gene alleles. Information obtained from these findings has the potential to inform and influence future exercise-related genes and training studies.",
