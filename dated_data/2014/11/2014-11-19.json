    "abstract": "Many complex human diseases are highly sexually dimorphic, suggesting a potential contribution of the X chromosome to disease risk. However, the X chromosome has been neglected or incorrectly analyzed in most genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We present tailored analytical methods and software that facilitate X-wide association studies (XWAS), which we further applied to reanalyze data from 16 GWAS of different autoimmune and related diseases (AID). We associated several X-linked genes with disease risk, among which (1) ARHGEF6 is associated with Crohns disease and replicated in a study of ulcerative colitis, another inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Indeed, ARHGEF6 interacts with a gastric bacterium that has been implicated in IBD. (2) CENPI is associated with three different AID, which is compelling in light of known associations with AID of autosomal genes encoding centromere proteins, as well as established autosomal evidence of pleiotropy between autoimmune diseases. (3) We replicated a previous association of FOXP3, a transcription factor that regulates T-cell development and function, with vitiligo; and (4) we discovered that C1GALT1C1 exhibits sex-specific effect on disease risk in both IBDs. These and other X-linked genes that we associated with AID tend to be highly expressed in tissues related to immune response, participate in major immune pathways, and display differential gene expression between males and females. Combined, the results demonstrate the importance of the X chromosome in autoimmunity, reveal the potential of extensive XWAS, even based on existing data, and provide the tools and incentive to properly include the X chromosome in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Hunting mode, the distinct set of behavioural strategies that a predator employs while hunting, can be an important determinant of the prey organisms behavioural response. However, few studies have considered how a predators hunting mode influences anti-predatory behaviours of a prey species. Here we document the influence of active hunters (zebra jumping spiders, Salticus scenicus) and ambush predators (Chinese praying mantids, Tenodera aridifolia sinensis) on the capture deterrence anti-predatory behavioural repertoire of the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. We hypothesized that D. melanogaster would reduce overall locomotory activity in the presence of ambush predators, and increase activity with active hunters. First we observed and described the behavioural repertoire of D. melanogaster in the presence of the predators. We documented three previously undescribed behaviours-abdominal lifting, stopping and retreat-which were performed at higher frequency by D. melanogaster in the presence of predators, and may aid in capture deterrence. Consistent with our predictions, we observed an increase in the overall activity of D. melanogaster in the presence of jumping spiders (active hunter). However, counter to our prediction, mantids (ambush hunter) had only a modest influence on activity. We also observed considerable intra and inter-individual variation in response to both predator types. Given these new insights into Drosophila behaviour, and with the genetic tools available, dissecting the molecular mechanisms of anti-predator behaviours may now be feasible in this system.",

    "abstract": "Gire et al. (Science 345:1369-1372, 2014) analyzed 81 complete genomes sampled from the 2014 Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreak and reported \\\"rapid accumulation of [...] genetic variation\\\" and a substitution rate that was \\\"roughly twice as high within the 2014 outbreak as between outbreaks.\\\" These findings have received widespread attention, and many have perceived Gire et al. (2014)s results as implying rapid adaptation of EBOV to humans during the current outbreak. Here, we argue that, on the contrary, sequence divergence in EBOV is rather limited, and that the currently available data contain no robust signal of particularly rapid evolution or adaptation to humans. The doubled substitution rate can be attributed entirely to the application of a molecular-clock model to a population of sequences with minimal divergence and segregating polymorphisms. Our results highlight how subtle technical aspects of sophisticated evolutionary analysis methods may result in highly-publicized, misconstrued statements about an ongoing public health crisis.",

    "abstract": "Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are the most abundant post-transcriptional regulators in bacteria. They serve ubiquitous roles that control nearly every aspects of bacterial physiology. Identification of important features from sRNAs sequences will guide the computational prediction of new sRNA sequences for a better understanding of the pervasive sRNA-mediated regulation in bacteria. In this study, we have performed systematic analyses of many sequence and structural features that are possibly related to sRNA properties and identified a subset of significant features that effectively discriminate sRNAs sequences from random sequences. we then used a neural network model that integrated these subfeatures on unlabeled testing datasets, and it had achieved a 92.2% recall and 89.8% specificity. Finally, we applied this prediction model for genome-wide identification of sRNAs-encoded genes using a sliding-window approach. We recovered multiple known sRNAs and hundreds of predicted new sRNAs. These candidate novel sRNAs deserve extensive study to better understand the sRNA-mediated regulatory network in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The human and chimpanzee X chromosomes are less divergent than expected based on autosomal divergence. This has led to a controversial hypothesis proposing a unique role of the X chromosome in human-chimpanzee speciation. We study incomplete lineage sorting patterns between humans, chimpanzees and gorillas to show that this low divergence is entirely due to megabase-sized regions comprising one-third of the X chromosome, where polymorphism in the human-chimpanzee ancestral species was severely reduced. Background selection can explain 10% of this reduction at most. Instead, we show that several strong selective sweeps in the ancestral species can explain this reduction of diversity in the ancestor. We also report evidence of population specific sweeps in extant humans that overlap the regions of low diversity in the ancestral species. These regions further correspond to chromosomal sections shown to be devoid of Neanderthal introgression into modern humans. This suggests that the same X-linked regions that undergo selective sweeps are among the first to form reproductive barriers between diverging species. We hypothesize that meiotic drive is the underlying mechanism causing these two observations.\\n\\nAuthors' SummaryBecause the speciation events that leads to human, chimpanzee and gorilla were close in time, their genetic relationship of these species varies along the genome. While human and chimpanzee species are most closely related, 15% of the human genome is more closely related to the gorilla genome than the chimpanzee genome, a phenomenon called incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). The amount and distribution of ILS can be predicted using population genetics theory, and is affected by demography and selection in the ancestral populations. It was previously reported that the X chromosome, in contrast to autosomes, is deprived of ILS, and this givies rise to controversial theories about the speciation event that splits humans and chimpanzees. Using a full genome alignment of the X chromosome, we show that this deprivation of ILS affects only one third of the chromosome. These regions also show reduced diversity in the extant populations of human and great apes, and coincide with regions devoid of Neanderthal introgression. We propose that these regions are targets of selection and that they played a role in the formation of reproductive barriers.",

    "abstract": "High molecular weight glutenin subunits of wheat are economically important seed storage proteins. They are coded by paralog pairs of the Glu-1 gene on each of the three genomes in the hexaploid wheat. Their expressions are under both temporal and spatial control. Many factors have been identified that influence the activity of Glu-1 genes, but the underlying regulatory mechanisms are still unclear. In order to identify motifs and motif clusters responsible for quantitative regulation of Glu-1 gene expressions, promoter profiles and transcription dynamics of the genes were analysed. It was found that promoter motif compositions of homoeolog Glu-1 genes are conserved. Our results demonstrated that while promoter profiles explain the differences of expression between homoeologs and between paralogs, it does not explain the variation of activity between alleles. Interestingly, our analyses revealed that the promoters of Glu-1 genes are divided into six cis-regulatory modules that are either locally overrepresented by binding sites belonging to unique but distinct transcription factor (TF) families or have conserved motif clusters. Moreover, our analyses demonstrated that the varying expression dynamics of TFs across genotypes is likely to be the primary contributor of the allelic variation of Glu-1 gene expressions. Thus, the six putative cis-regulatory modules in the Glu-1 gene promoters bound by the differentially expressed TFs are suggested to play a key role in the quantitative and tissue specific regulation of these genes.",
