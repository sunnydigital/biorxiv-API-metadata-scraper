    "abstract": "The analysis of whole-genome or exome sequencing data from trios and pedigrees has being successfully applied to the identification of disease-causing mutations. However, most methods used to identify and genotype genetic variants from next-generation sequencing data ignore the relationships between samples, resulting in significant Mendelian errors, false positives and negatives. Here we present a Bayesian network framework that jointly analyses data from all members of a pedigree simultaneously using Mendelian segregation priors, yet providing the ability to detect de novo mutations in offspring, and is scalable to large pedigrees. We evaluated our method by simulations and analysis of WGS data from a 17 individual, 3-generation CEPH pedigree sequenced to 50X average depth. Compared to singleton calling, our family caller produced more high quality variants and eliminated spurious calls as judged by common quality metrics such as Ti/Tv, Het/Hom ratios, and dbSNP/SNP array data concordance. We developed a ground truth dataset to further evaluate our calls by identifying recombination cross-overs in the pedigree and testing variants for consistency with the inferred phasing, and we show that our method significantly outperforms singleton and population variant calling in pedigrees. We identify all previously validated de novo mutations in NA12878, concurrent with a 7X precision improvement. Our results show that our method is scalable to large genomics and human disease studies and allows cost optimization by rational sequencing capacity distribution.",

    "abstract": "Predicting biological structure has remained challenging for systems such as disordered proteins that take on myriad conformations. Hybrid simulation/experiment strategies have been undermined by difficulties in evaluating errors from computa- tional model inaccuracies and data uncertainties. Building on recent proposals from maximum entropy theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we address these issues through a Bayesian Energy Landscape Tilting (BELT) scheme for computing Bayesian \\\"hyperensembles\\\" over conformational ensembles. BELT uses Markov chain Monte Carlo to directly sample maximum-entropy conformational ensembles consistent with a set of input experimental observables. To test this framework, we apply BELT to model trialanine, starting from disagreeing simulations with the force fields ff96, ff99, ff99sbnmr-ildn, CHARMM27, and OPLS-AA. BELT incorporation of limited chemical shift and 3J measurements gives convergent values of the peptides , {beta}, and PPII conformational populations in all cases. As a test of predictive power, all five BELT hyperensembles recover set-aside measurements not used in the fitting and report accu- rate errors, even when starting from highly inaccurate simulations. BELTs principled fxramework thus enables practical predictions for complex biomolecular systems from discordant simulations and sparse data.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian females pay high energetic costs for reproduction, the greatest of which is imposed by lactation. The synthesis of milk requires, in part, the mobilization of bodily reserves to nourish developing young. Numerous hypotheses have been advanced to predict how mothers will differentially invest in sons and daughters, however few studies have addressed sex-biased milk synthesis. Here we leverage the dairy cow model to investigate such phenomena. Using 2.39 million lactation records from 1.49 million dairy cows, we demonstrate that the sex of the fetus influences the capacity of the mammary gland to synthesize milk during lactation. Cows favor daughters, producing significantly more milk for daughters than for sons across lactation. Using a sub-sample of this dataset (N = 113,750 subjects) we further demonstrate that the effects of fetal sex interact dynamically across parities, whereby the sex of the fetus being gestated can enhance or diminish the production of milk during an established lactation. Moreover the sex of the fetus gestated on the first parity has persistent consequences for milk synthesis on the subsequent parity. Specifically, gestation of a daughter on the first parity increases milk production by [~]445 kg over the first two lactations. Our results identify a dramatic and sustained programming of mammary function by offspring in utero. Nutritional and endocrine conditions in utero are known to have pronounced and long-term effects on progeny, but the ways in which the progeny has sustained physiological effects on the dam have received little attention to date.",
