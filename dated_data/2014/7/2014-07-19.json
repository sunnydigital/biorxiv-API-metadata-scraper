    "abstract": "Summary: Molecular inversion probes (MIPs) allow efficient enrichment of genomic regions of interest for the purpose of targeted sequencing. To date, there is a paucity of simple-to-use software to align sequences derived from this method. Here, we describe a single program that performs mapping, arm removal, and deduplication before outputting alignments in SAM format.
