    "abstract": "Following the increase in available sequenced genomes, tissue-specific transcriptomes are being determined for a rapidly growing number of highly diverse species. Traditionally, only the transcriptomes of related species with equivalent tissues have been compared. Such an analysis is much more challenging over larger evolutionary distances when complementary tissues cannot readily be defined. Here, we present a method for the cross-species mapping of tissue-specific and developmental gene expression patterns across a wide range of animals, including many non-model species. Our approach maps gene expression patterns between species without requiring the definition of homologous tissues. With the help of this mapping, gene expression patterns can be compared even across distantly related species. In our survey of 36 datasets across 27 species, we detected conserved expression programs on all taxonomic levels, both within animals and between the animals and their closest unicellular relatives, the choanoflagellates. We found that the rate of change in tissue expression patterns is a property of gene families. Our findings open new avenues of study for the comparison and transfer of knowledge between different species.",

    "abstract": "In studies of gene regulation, it is often tacitly assumed that the interactions between transcriptional regulators and their target promoters are finely tuned to ensure condition-appropriate gene expression of the targets. However, how natural selection might evolve such precise regulation from an initial state without regulation, is rarely discussed. In addition, the accuracy of gene regulation is affected by noise in gene expression [1]. Expression noise varies greatly across genes [2-5], suggesting that natural selection has affected noise levels, but the role of expression noise in gene regulation is currently poorly understood [6]. Here we present a combination of experimental evidence and theoretical modeling showing that the transmission of expression noise from regulators to their targets can function as a rudimentary form of gene regulation that facilitates the evolution of more finely tuned gene regulation. To assess how natural selection has affected transcriptional noise in E. coli, we evolved a large set of synthetic promoters under carefully controlled selective conditions and found, surprisingly, that native E. coli promoters show no signs of having been selected for minimizing their noise. Instead, a subset of native promoters, which are characterized by high expression plasticity and high numbers of regulatory inputs, show elevated noise levels. A general theoretical model, which recognizes that target genes are not only affected by the condition-dependent activities of their regulators, but also by the regulators noise, explains these observations. Noise transmission from regulators to their targets is favored by selection whenever regulation is imprecise, and may even constitute the main function of coupling a promoter to a regulator. Our theory provides a novel framework for understanding the evolution of gene regulation, demonstrating that in many situations expression noise is not the mere unwanted side-effect of regulatory interactions, but a beneficial function that is key to the evolvability of regulatory interactions.",
