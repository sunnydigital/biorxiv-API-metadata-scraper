    "abstract": "The study of ecological networks is severely limited by (i) the difficulty to access data, (ii) the lack of a standardized way to link meta-data with interactions, and (iii) the disparity of formats in which ecological networks themselves are represented. To overcome these limitations, we conceived a data specification for ecological networks. We implemented a database respecting this standard, and released a R package (rmangal) allowing users to programmatically access, curate, and deposit data on ecological interactions. In this article, we show how these tools, in conjunctions with other frameworks for the programmatic manipulation of open ecological data, streamlines the analysis process, and improves eplicability and reproducibility of ecological networks studies.",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is exquisitely adapted to the human host, and much research has focused on its evolution over long timescales spanning millennia. Here, we review recent data exploring the evolution of the virus on much shorter timescales, on the order of days or months. We describe the intrahost genetic diversity of the virus isolated from humans, and how this diversity contributes to HCMV spatiotemporal evolution. We propose mechanisms to explain the high levels of intrahost diversity and discuss how this new information may shed light on HCMV infection and pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Escallonia is a morphologically and ecologically diverse clade of shrubs and small trees widely distributed in three hotspots of plant diversity. Previous studies suggested that extant species may have radiated rapidly and/or recently resulting in complex patterns of molecular variation across this genus. This result is apparently mirrored in morphology because species also display complex and overlapping patterns of morphological variation. Taken together, these patterns call into question the identity of all species within Escallonia. To evaluate the currently proposed hypotheses of species boundaries, I used molecular, morphological, and bioclimatic a data for 35 species and assessed three species criteria: genealogical exclusivity, morphological gaps, and climatic niche differences. Interpreting these data in the context of species as segments of evolutionary lineages, I provide evidence that most species (ca. 70%) within Escallonia represent distinct species on independent evolutionary trajectories. Instead of rejecting the current hypotheses of species limit, I argue for taxonomic stability as it provides a useful framework for studies aiming to understand the mechanisms driving the origin and evolution of species in hotspots of biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which populations experiencing shared selective pressures adapt through a shared genetic response is relevant to many questions in evolutionary biology. In a number of well studied traits and species, it appears that convergent evolution within species is common. In this paper, we explore how standing, genetic variation contributes to convergent genetic responses in a geographically spread population, extending our previous work on the topic. Geographically limited dispersal slows the spread of each selected allele, hence allowing other alleles - newly arisen mutants or present as standing variation - to spread before any one comes to dominate the population. When such alleles meet, their progress is substantially slowed - if the alleles are selectively equivalent, they mix slowly, dividing the species range into a random tessellation, which can be well understood by analogy to a Poisson process model of crystallization. In this framework, we derive the geographic scale over which a typical allele is expected to dominate, the time it takes the species to adapt as a whole, and the proportion of adaptive alleles that arise from standing variation. Finally, we explore how negative pleiotropic effects of alleles before an environment change can bias the subset of alleles that contribute to the species adaptive response. We apply the results to the many geographically localized G6PD deficiency alleles thought to confer resistance to malaria, where the large mutational target size makes it a likely candidate for adaptation from standing variation, despite the selective cost of G6PD deficiency alleles in the absence of malaria. We find the numbers and geographic spread of these alleles matches our predictions reasonably well, consistent with the view that they arose from a combination of standing variation and new mutations since the advent of malaria. Our results suggest that much of adaptation may be geographically local even when selection pressures are homogeneous. Therefore, we argue that caution must be exercised when arguing that strongly geographically restricted alleles are necessarily the outcome of local adaptation. We close by discussing the implications of these results for ideas of species coherence and the nature of divergence between species.",
