    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are the most active, diverse and ancient component in a broad range of genomes. As such, a complete understanding of genome function and evolution cannot be achieved without a thorough understanding of TE impact and biology. However, in-depth analyses of TEs still represent a challenge due to the repetitive nature of these genomic entities. In this work, we present a broadly applicable and flexible tool: T-lex2. T-lex2 is the only available software that allows routine,automatic, and accurate genotyping of individual TE insertions and estimation of their population frequencies both using individual strain and pooled next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Furthermore, T-lex2 also assesses the quality of the calls allowing the identification of miss-annotated TEs and providing the necessary information to re-annotate them. Although we tested the fidelity of T-lex2 using the high quality Drosophila melanogaster genome, the flexible and customizable design of T-lex2 allows running it in any genome and for any type of TE insertion. Overall, T-lex2 represents a significant improvement in our ability to analyze the contribution of TEs to genome function and evolution as well as learning about the biology of TEs. T-lex2 is freely available online at http://petrov.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/Tlex.html.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling is supposed to be triggered by a dramatic ligand-induced conformational change of the extracellular domain from a closed, self-inhibited tethered monomer, to an open untethered state, which exposes a loop required for dimerization and activation. The ectodomain also untethers spontaneously, but the molecular mechanism is still unknown. Experiments with the mAb806 antibody have suggested the existence of a third untethered state, still uncharacterized, appearing transiently during the tethered to untethered transition, and which exposes a cryptic epitope hidden in the known structures. Here, molecular dynamics simulations of two ectodomain mutants (R84K and G39R) targeting a hinge at domain I-II interface highlight the possibility of such additional intermediate conformer. The new conformation is untethered but surprisingly compact, and originates from a large rotation of domain I that exposes the mAb806 epitope, in a similar way as the EGFRvIII deletion does. The present findings not only point to different molecular processes for ligand-dependent and spontaneous untethering, but also suggest that domain I-II mutation clusters and the EGFRvIII deletion may share a common structural mechanism, based on the removal of an steric hindrance from domain I that restricts dimerization.",

    "abstract": "Formidable difficulties arise when attempting to explain the non-enzymatic replication, proliferation, and the acquisition of homochirality and information content, of RNA and DNA at the beginnings of life. However, new light can be shed on these problems by viewing the origin of life as a non-equilibrium thermodynamic process in which RNA, DNA and other fundamental molecules of life arose as structures to dissipate the prevailing solar spectrum. Here we present experimental results which demonstrate that the absorption and dissipation of UV-C light by DNA at temperatures below their melting temperature leads to complete and reversible denaturing for small synthetic DNA of 25 base pairs (bp), and to partial and reversible denaturing for 48 bp DNA and for large salmon sperm and yeast DNA of average size 100 kbp. This result has direct bearing on the above mentioned problems and thereby opens the door to a possible thermodynamic route to the origin of life.",

    "abstract": "Although the past decade has seen tremendous progress in our understanding of fine-scale recombination, little is known about non-crossover (NCO) gene conversion. We report the first genome-wide study of NCO events in humans. Using SNP array data from 98 meioses, we identified 103 sites affected by NCO, of which 50/52 were confirmed in sequence data. Overlap with double strand break (DSB) hotspots indicates that the events are likely of meiotic origin. We estimate that a site is involved in a NCO at a rate of 5.7x10-6/bp/generation, consistent with sperm-typing studies, and infer that tract lengths span at least an order of magnitude. Observed NCO events show strong allelic bias at heterozygous AT/GC SNPs, with 68% (58-78%) transmitting GC alleles (P=5x10-4). Strikingly, in 4 of 15 regions for which there are also resequencing data, multiple disjoint NCO tracts cluster in close proximity (~20-30 kb), a phenomenon not previously seen in mammals.",

    "abstract": "The conserved CUGBP1, Elav-like (CELF) family of RNA binding proteins contribute to heart and skeletal muscle development and are implicated in myotonic dystrophy (DM). To understand genome-wide functions of CELF proteins, we analyzed transcriptome dynamics following induction of CELF1 or CELF2 in adult mouse heart or CELF1 in muscle by RNA-seq, complemented by crosslinking/immunoprecipitation-sequencing (CLIP-seq) analysis of mouse cells and tissues to distinguish direct from indirect regulatory targets. Analysis of expression and mRNA binding data revealed hundreds of mRNAs bound in their 3' UTRs by both CELF1 and and the developmentally induced Mbnl1 protein, 3-fold more than expected. The relative extent of CELF1 and Mbnl1 binding in 3' UTRs predicted the extent of repression or stabilization, respectively, following CELF induction. These findings support a ?Cytoplasmic Competition? model in which CELF and Mbnl proteins compete to specify degradation or membrane localization/stabilization, respectively, of an overlapping set of targets. Several hundred messages contained proximal CELF1 and Mbnl1 binding sites (within 50 bases), and were more strongly repressed by CELF1 than messages with distal sites. Messages with different spacing of CELF and Mbnl sites in their 3' UTRs exhibited different developmental dynamics, suggesting that spacing is used to tune cytoplasmic competition between these factors to specify the timing of developmental induction. CELF1 also shared dozens of splicing targets with Mbnl1, most regulated oppositely, confirming a phenomenon observed in smaller scale studies but not previously supported by genome-wide methods, which also appears to enhance developmental transitions.",

    "abstract": "The genomic neighborhood of a gene influences its activity, a behavior that is attributable in part to domain-scale regulation, in which regions of hundreds or thousands of kilobases known as domains are regulated as a unit. Previous studies using genomics assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq and chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based assays have identified many types of regulatory domains. However, due to the difficulty of integrating genomics data sets, the relationships among these domain types are poorly understood. Semi-automated genome annotation (SAGA) algorithms facilitate human interpretation of heterogeneous collections of genomics data by simultaneously partitioning the human genome and assigning labels to the resulting genomic segments. However, existing SAGA methods can incorporate only data sets that can be expressed as a one-dimensional vector over the genome and therefore cannot integrate inherently pairwise chromatin conformation data. We developed a new computational method, called graph-based regularization (GBR), for expressing a pairwise prior that encourages certain pairs of genomic loci to receive the same label in a genome annotation. We used GBR to exploit chromatin conformation information during genome annotation by encouraging positions that are close in 3D to occupy the same type of domain. Using this approach, we produced a comprehensive model of chromatin domains in eight human cell types, thereby revealing the relationships among known domain types. Through this model, we identified clusters of tightly-regulated genes expressed in only a small number of cell types, which we term \\\"specific expression domains.\\\" We additionally found that a subset of domain boundaries marked by promoters and CTCF motifs are consistent between cell types even when domain activity changes. Finally, we showed that GBR can be used for the seemingly unrelated task of transferring information from well-studied cell types to less well characterized cell types during genome annotation, making it possible to produce high-quality annotations of the hundreds of cell types with limited available data.",

For this unique sub-cohort, LifeLines DEEP, additional blood (n=1387), exhaled air (n=1425), fecal samples (n=1248) and gastrointestinal health questionnaires (n=1176) were collected for analysis of the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, microbiome, metabolome and other biological levels. Here, we provide an overview of the different data layers in LifeLines DEEP and present baseline characteristics of the study population including food intake and quality of life. We also describe how the LifeLines DEEP cohort allows for the detailed investigation of genetic, genomic and metabolic variation on a wealth of phenotypic outcomes. Finally, we examine the determinants of gastrointestinal health, an area of particular interest to us that can be addressed by LifeLines DEEP.",

    "abstract": "There has been much excitement about the possibility that exposure to specific environments can induce an ecological memory in the form of whole-sale, genome-wide epigenetic changes that are maintained over many generations. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, numerous heritable DNA methylation differences have been identified in greenhouse-grown isogenic lines, but it remains unknown how natural, highly variable environments affect the rate and spectrum of such changes. Here we present detailed methylome analyses in a geographically dispersed A. thaliana population that constitutes a collection of near-isogenic lines, diverged for at least a century from a common ancestor. We observed little DNA methylation divergence whole-genome wide. Nonetheless, methylome variation largely reflected genetic distance, and was in many aspects similar to that of lines raised in uniform conditions. Thus, even when plants are grown in varying and diverse natural sites, genome-wide epigenetic variation accumulates in a clock-like manner, and epigenetic divergence thus parallels the pattern of genome-wide DNA sequence divergence.",
