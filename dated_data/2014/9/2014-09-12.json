    "abstract": "Mutations in the RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 are known to disrupt processing of 5p-strand pre-miRNAs and these mutations have previously been associated with cancer. Using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas project, we show that these mutations are recurrent across four cancer types and that a previously uncharacterized recurrent mutation in the adjacent RNase IIIa domain also disrupts 5p-strand miRNA processing. Analysis of the downstream effects of the resulting imbalance 5p/3p shows a statistically significant effect on the expression of mRNAs targeted by major conserved miRNA families. In summary, these mutations in DICER1 lead to an imbalance in miRNA strands, which has an effect on mRNA transcript levels that appear to contribute to the oncogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic cortical dynamics are thought to underlie trial-to-trial variability of visually evoked responses in animal models. Understanding their function in the context of sensory processing and representation is a major current challenge. Here we report that intrinsic cortical dynamics strongly affect the representational geometry of a brain region, as reflected in response-pattern dissimilarities, and exaggerate the similarity of representations between brain regions. We characterized the representations in several human visual areas by representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) constructed from fMRI response-patterns for natural image stimuli. The RDMs of different visual areas were highly similar when the response-patterns were estimated on the basis of the same trials (sharing intrinsic cortical dynamics), and quite distinct when patterns were estimated on the basis of separate trials (sharing only the stimulus-driven component). We show that the greater similarity of the representational geometries can be explained by the coherent fluctuations of regional-mean activation within visual cortex, reflecting intrinsic dynamics. Using separate trials to study stimulus-driven representations revealed clearer distinctions between the representational geometries: a Gabor wavelet pyramid model explained representational geometry in visual areas V1-3 and a categorical animate- inanimate model in the object-responsive lateral occipital cortex.",

    "abstract": "Variability is ubiquitous in nature and a fundamental feature of complex systems. Few studies, however, have investigated variance itself as a trait under genetic control. By focusing primarily on trait means and ignoring the effect of alternative alleles on trait variability, we may be missing an important axis of genetic variation contributing to phenotypic differences among individuals1,2. To study genetic effects on individual-to-individual phenotypic variability (or intragenotypic variability), we used a panel of Drosophila inbred lines3 and focused on locomotor handedness4, in an assay optimized to measure variability. We discovered that some lines had consistently high levels of intragenotypic variability among individuals while others had low levels. We demonstrate that the degree of variability is itself heritable. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the degree of intragenotypic variability as the phenotype across lines, we identified several genes expressed in the brain that affect variability in handedness without affecting the mean. One of these genes, Ten-a, implicated a neuropil in the central complex5 of the fly brain as influencing the magnitude of behavioral variability, a brain region involved in sensory integration and locomotor coordination6. We have validated these results using genetic deficiencies, null alleles, and inducible RNAi transgenes. This study reveals the constellation of phenotypes that can arise from a single genotype and it shows that different genetic backgrounds differ dramatically in their propensity for phenotypic variability. Because traditional mean-focused GWASs ignore the contribution of variability to overall phenotypic variation, current methods may miss important links between genotype and phenotype.\\n\\nAbbreviationsDGRP: Drosophila Genome Reference Panel; ANOMV: Analysis of means for variance; QTL: quantitative trait loci, GWAS: genome wide association study, MAD: median absolute deviation.
