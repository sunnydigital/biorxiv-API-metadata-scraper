    "abstract": "Whole-exome sequencing studies have identified common mutations affecting genes encoding components of the RNA splicing machinery in hematological malignancies. Here, we sought to determine how mutations affecting the 3' splice site recognition factor U2AF1 alter its normal role in RNA splicing. We find that U2AF1 mutations influence the similarity of splicing programs in leukemias, but do not give rise to widespread splicing failure. U2AF1 mutations cause differential splicing of hundreds of genes, affecting biological pathways such as DNA methylation (DNMT3B), X chromosome inactivation (H2AFY), the DNA damage response (ATR, FANCA), and apoptosis (CASP8). We show that U2AF1 mutations alter the preferred 3' splice site motif in patients, in cell culture, and in vitro. Mutations affecting the first and second zinc fingers give rise to different alterations in splice site preference and largely distinct downstream splicing programs. These allele-specific effects are consistent with a computationally predicted model of U2AF1 in complex with RNA. Our findings suggest that U2AF1 mutations contribute to pathogenesis by causing quantitative changes in splicing that affect diverse cellular pathways, and give insight into the normal function of U2AF1s zinc finger domains.",

    "abstract": "In tropical forests, one of the most common relationships between parasites and insects is that between the fungus Ophiocordyceps (Ophiocordycipitaceae, Hypocreales, Ascomycota) and ants, especially within the tribe Camponotini. These fungi have the ability to penetrate the exoskeleton of the ant and to manipulate the behavior of the host, making it leave the nest and ascend understorey shrubs, to die biting onto the vegetation: hence, the term zombie-ant fungi to describe this behavioral changes on the host. It is posited that this behavioral change aids spore dispersal and thus increases the chances of infection. Despite their undoubted importance for ecosystem functioning, these fungal pathogens are still poorly documented, especially regarding their diversity, ecology and evolutionary relationships. Here, we describe three new and host-specific species of the genus Ophiocordyceps on Camponotus ants from the central Amazonian region of Brazil which can readily be separated using classic taxonomic criteria, in particular ascospore morphology. In addition, we also employed molecular techniques to show for the first time the phylogenetic relationships between these taxa and closely related species within the Ophiocordyceps unilateralis complex, as well as with other members of the family Ophiocordycipitaceae.",

    "abstract": "As a direct result of intense heat and aridity, deserts are thought to be among the most harsh of environments, particularly for their mammalian inhabitants. Given that osmoregulation can be challenging for these animals, with failure resulting in death, strong selection should be observed on genes related to the maintenance of water and solute balance. One such animal, Peromyscus eremicus, is native to the desert regions of the southwest United States and may live its entire life without oral fluid intake. As a first step toward understanding the genetics that underlie this phenotype, we present a characterization of the P. eremicus transcriptome. We assay four tissues (kidney, liver, brain, testes) from a single individual and supplement this with population level renal transcriptome sequencing from 15 additional animals. We identified a set of transcripts undergoing both purifying and balancing selection based on estimates of Tajimas D. In addition, we used the branch-site test to identify a transcript - Slc2a9, likely related to desert osmoregulation - undergoing enhanced selection in P. eremicus relative to a set of related non-desert rodents.",

    "abstract": "Identifying adaptively important loci in recently bottlenecked populations - be it natural selection acting on a population following the colonization of novel habitats in the wild, or artificial selection during the domestication of a breed - remains a major challenge. Here we report the results of a simulation study examining the performance of available population-genetic tools for identifying genomic regions under selection. To illustrate our findings, we examined the interplay between selection and demography in two species of Peromyscus mice, for which we have independent evidence of selection acting on phenotype as well as functional evidence identifying the underlying genotype. With this unusual information, we tested whether population-genetic-based approaches could have been utilized to identify the adaptive locus. Contrary to published claims, we conclude that the use of the background site frequency spectrum as a null model is largely ineffective in bottlenecked populations. Results are quantified both for site frequency spectrum and linkage disequilibrium-based predictions, and are found to hold true across a large parameter space that encompasses many species and populations currently under study. These results suggest that the genomic footprint left by selection on both new and standing variation in strongly bottlenecked populations will be difficult, if not impossible, to find using current approaches.",

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data has been the subject of intense research activity over the past many decades. A variety of models and methods have been developed to address different aspects of this important problem. However, these techniques are often difficult to scale, are narrowly focused on particular biological and experimental platforms, and require experimental data that are typically unavailable and difficult to ascertain. The more recent availability of higher-throughput sequencing platforms, combined with more precise modes of genetic perturbation, presents an opportunity to formulate more robust and comprehensive approaches to gene network inference. Here, we propose a step-wise framework for identifying gene-gene regulatory interactions that expand from a known point of genetic or chemical perturbation using time series gene expression data. This novel approach sequentially identifies non-steady state genes post-perturbation and incorporates them into a growing series of low-complexity optimization problems. The governing ordinary differential equations of this model are rooted in the biophysics of stochastic molecular events that underlie gene regulation, delineating roles for both protein and RNA-mediated gene regulation. We show the successful application of our core algorithms for network inference using simulated and real datasets.",

    "abstract": "2. Abstract BackgroundBackground: One of the hallmarks of prostate cancer development is the amplification of C-MYC copy numbers. It is not yet clear what the driving force behind the activation of C-MYC expression in prostate cancer is. CTCF, which is known for its role as chromatin organiser, is thought to be involved in the activation of C-MYC expression. The affinity of CTCF to its binding site on the DNA is negatively affected by methylation of CpG islands, including its binding site within the promoter sequences of C-MYC. DNA hypermethylation is often found in cancer cells and could therefore be responsible for reduced binding of CTCF at the C-MYC promoter, which can in turn lead to enhanced expression.\\n\\nResultsHere, the copy number of C-MYC of five different prostate cancer cell lines has been determined by FISH, and the state of methylation of the binding site of CTCF upstream of C-MYC was investigated. The C-MYC locus was shown to be amplified to various degrees in all cell lines, reflecting the copy number of actual tumors very well, but methylation was found to remain unchanged compared to healthy cells in all examined cell lines. Hence, no correlation between C-MYC-copy number and CTCF binding possibilities could be established.\\n\\nConclusionsThe enhanced expression of C-MYC in prostate cancer cell lines is not affected by CTCF, whose binding presumably still persists. C-MYC activation in prostate cancer must therefore be caused by a disparate mechanism, which also deviates from other well known mechanisms that are seen in Burkitt-Lymphoma, Leukemia and breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Long distance migrations are well known to occur in many baleen whale species. Yet, a global synthesis of this information is lacking. Here, we study baleen whales as a group and at a global scale, first analyzing the grey and peer-reviewed literature for information on the location of baleen whale calving and feeding grounds around the world. This information was then combined with modeled-data produced from an Earth System Model to estimate the global distribution of baleen whale calving and feeding habitats. A simple network theoretic heuristic was then used to identify the shortest over-water path connecting habitats. These shortest paths map well to known major migration routes for a number of species, suggesting that migration has evolved primarily to minimize travel distances. Identifying distance minimizing routes globally, that have demonstrable consistency to known migration routes for certain baleen whale species, offers a useful baseline perspective on large-scale migration patterns, from which many perturbations can by judged. As an example, we used our modeled migration routes to identify regions of the ocean that are likely hotspots of whale ship-strikes. Such information is useful for developing global conservation and management priorities for baleen whales.",

    "abstract": "XWAS is a new software suite for the analysis of the X chromosome in association studies and similar studies. The X chromosome plays an important role in human disease, especially those with sexually dimorphic characteristics. Special attention needs to be given to its analysis due to the unique inheritance pattern, which leads to analytical complications that have resulted in the majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) either not considering X or mishandling it with toolsets that had been designed for non-sex chromosomes. We hence developed XWAS to fill the need for tools that are specially designed for analysis of X. Following extensive, stringent, and X-specific quality control, XWAS offers an array of statistical tests of association, including: (1) the standard test between a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) and disease risk, including after first stratifying individuals by sex, (2) a test for a differential effect of a SNP on disease between males and females, (3) motivated by X-inactivation, a test for higher variance of a trait in heterozygous females as compared to homozygous females, and (4) for all tests, a version that allows for combining evidence from all SNPs across a gene. We applied the toolset analysis pipeline to 16 GWAS datasets of immune-related disorders and 7 risk factors of coronary artery disease, and discovered several new X-linked genetic associations. XWAS will provide the tools and incentive for others to incorporate the X chromosome into GWAS, hence enabling discoveries of novel loci implicated in many diseases and in their sexual dimorphism.",
