    "abstract": "A significant feature of the genomes of Lepidoptera, butterflies and moths, is the high conservation of chromosome organization. Recent remarkable progress in genome sequencing of Lepidoptera has revealed that syntenic gene order is extensively conserved across phylogenetically distant species. The ancestral karyotype of Lepidoptera is thought to be n = 31; however, that of the most well studied moth, Bombyx mori, is n = 28, suggesting that three chromosomal fusion events occurred in this lineage. To identify the boundaries between predicted ancient fusions involving B. mori chromosomes 11, 23 and 24, we constructed FISELbased chromosome maps of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (n = 31). We first determined 511 Mb genomic sequence of the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis, a congener of O. nubilalis, and isolated BAC and fosmid clones that were expected to localize in candidate regions for the boundaries using these sequences. Combined with FISH and genetic analysis, we narrowed down the candidate regions to 40kb - 1.5Mb, in strong agreement with a previous estimate based on the genome of a butterfly, Melitaea cinxia. The significant difference in the lengths of the candidate regions where no functional genes were observed may reflect the evolutionary time after fusion events.",

    "abstract": "The mosquito Aedes aegypti is a potent vector of the Chikungunya, yellow fever, and Dengue viruses, which result in hundreds of millions of infections and over 50,000 human deaths per year. Loss-of-function mutagenesis in Ae. aegypti has been established with TALENs, ZFNs, and homing endonucleases, which require the engineering of DNA-binding protein domains to generate target specificity for a particular stretch of genomic DNA. Here, we describe the first use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate targeted, site-specific mutations in Ae. aegypti. CRISPR-Cas9 relies on RNA-DNA base-pairing to generate targeting specificity, resulting in cheaper, faster, and more flexible genome-editing reagents. We investigate the efficiency of reagent concentrations and compositions, demonstrate the ability of CRISPR-Cas9 to generate several different types of mutations via disparate repair mechanisms, and show that stable germ-line mutations can be readily generated at the vast majority of genomic loci tested. This work offers a detailed exploration into the optimal use of CRISPR-Cas9 in Ae. aegypti that should be applicable to non-model organisms previously out of reach of genetic modification.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs are a wide class of [~]22 nt non-coding RNAs of metazoans capable of inhibiting target mRNAs translation by binding to partially complementary sites in their 3UTRs. Due to their regulatory potential, miRNAs are implicated in functioning of a broad range of biological pathways and processes. Here we investigate the functions of the miR-959-964 cluster expressed predominantly in testes of Drosophila melanogaster. The deletion of miR-959-964 resulted in male sterility due to the disturbance of the spermatid individualization process. Analysis of the transcriptome by microarray followed by luciferase reporter assay revealed didum, for, fdl and CG10512 as the targets of miR-959-964. Moreover, the deletion of miR-959-964 is accompanied by a decreased the expression of genes responsible for microtubule-based movement and spermatid differentiation. Thus, we suggest that miR-959-964 can control the process of spermatid individualization by direct and indirect modulating the expression of different components of the individualization process. In addition, we have shown that in comparison to other miRNAs, the rate of evolution of the testis-specific miR-959-964 cluster is unusually high, indicating its possible involvement in speciation via reproductive isolation.",
