    "abstract": "Community ecology is tasked with the considerable challenge of predicting the structure, and properties, of emerging ecosystems. It requires the ability to understand how and why species interact, as this will allow the development of mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the existence of interspecific interactions. Here we argue that the current conceptualization of species interaction networks is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future research must start to account for the intrinsic variability of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or properties related to the establishment of species interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based processes, we show that this new approach will improve our predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how species interact over large spatial or temporal scales.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of populations in domestic species offer great opportunities to study genome response to selection. The recently published Sheep Hapmap dataset is a great example of characterization of the world wide genetic diversity in the Sheep. In this study, we re-analyzed the Sheep Hapmap dataset to identify selection signatures in worldwide Sheep populations. Compared to previous analyses, we make use of statistical methods that (i) take account of the hierarchical structure of sheep populations, (ii) make use of Linkage Disequilibrium information and (iii) focus specifically on either recent or older selection signatures. We show that this allows to pinpoint several new selection signatures in the sheep genome and to distinguish those related to modern breeding objectives and to earlier post-domestication constraints. The newly identified regions, together with the one previously identified, reveal the extensive genome response to selection on morphology, color and adaptation to new environments.",

    "abstract": "One of the key questions in biology is how the metabolism of a cell responds to changes in the environment. In budding yeast, starvation causes a drop in intracellular pH, but the functional role of this pH change is not well understood. Here, we show that the enzyme glutamine synthetase (Gln1) forms filaments at low pH and that filament formation leads to enzyme inactivation. Filament formation by Gln1 is a highly cooperative process, strongly dependent on macromolecular crowding, and involves back-to-back stacking of cylindrical homo-decamers into filaments that associate laterally to form higher order fibrils. Other metabolic enzymes also assemble into filaments at low pH. Hence, we propose that filament formation is a general mechanism to inactivate and store key metabolic enzymes during a state of advanced cellular starvation. These findings have broad implications for understanding the interplay between nutritional stress, the metabolism and the physical organization of a cell.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCirculating cell free fetal DNA has enabled non-invasive prenatal fetal aneuploidy testing without direct discrimination of the genetically distinct maternal and fetal DNA. Current testing may be improved by specifically enriching the sample material for fetal DNA. DNA methylation may allow for such a separation of DNA and thus support additional clinical opportunities; however, this depends on knowledge of the methylomes of ccf DNA and its cellular contributors.\\n\\nResultsWhole genome bisulfite sequencing was performed on a set of unmatched samples including ccf DNA from 8 non-pregnant (NP) and 7 pregnant female donors and genomic DNA from 7 maternal buffy coat and 5 placenta samples. We found CpG cytosines within longer fragments were more likely to be methylated, linking DNA methylation and fragment size in ccf DNA. Comparison of the methylomes of placenta and NP ccf DNA revealed many of the 51,259 identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were located in domains exhibiting consistent placenta hypomethylation across millions of consecutive bases, regions we termed placenta hypomethylated domains (PHDs). We found PHDs were consistently located within regions exhibiting low CpG and gene density. DMRs identified when comparing placenta to NP ccf DNA were recapitulated in pregnant ccf DNA, confirming the ability to detect differential methylation in ccf DNA mixtures.\\n\\nConclusionsWe generated methylome maps for four sample types at single base resolution, identified a link between DNA methylation and fragment length in ccf DNA, identified DMRs between sample groups, and uncovered the presence of megabase-size placenta hypomethylated domains. Furthermore, we anticipate these results to provide a foundation to which future studies using discriminatory DNA methylation may be compared.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of gene expression underlies cell identity. Chromatin structure and gene activity are linked at multiple levels, via positioning of genomic loci to transcriptionally permissive or repressive environments and by connecting cis-regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. However, the genome-wide dynamics of these processes during cell differentiation has not been characterized. Using tethered chromatin conformation capture (TCC) sequencing we determined global three-dimensional chromatin structures in mouse embryonic stem (ES) and neural stem (NS) cell derivatives. We found that changes in the propensity of genomic regions to form inter-chromosomal contacts are pervasive in neural induction and are associated with the regulation of gene expression. Moreover, we found a pronounced contribution of euchromatic domains to the intra-chromosomal interaction network of pluripotent cells, indicating the existence of an ES cell-specific mode of chromatin organization. Mapping of promoter-enhancer interactions in pluripotent and differentiated cells revealed that spatial proximity without enhancer element activity is a common architectural feature in cells undergoing early developmental changes. Activity-independent formation of higher-order contacts between cis-regulatory elements, predominant at complex loci, may thus provide an additional layer of transcriptional control.",

    "abstract": "Humans in many societies cooperate in economic experiments at much higher levels than would be expected if their goal was maximizing economic returns, even when their interactions are anonymous and one-shot. This is a puzzle because paying a cost to benefit another in one-shot interactions gives no direct or indirect benefits to the cooperator. This paper explores the logic of two competing evolutionary hypotheses to explain this behavior. The \\\"norm psychology\\\" hypothesis holds that a player's choice of strategy reflects socially-learned cultural norms. Its premise is that over the course of human evolutionary history, cultural norms varied considerably across human societies and through a process of gene-culture co-evolution, humans evolved mechanisms to learn and adopt the norms that are successful in their particular society. The \\\"mismatch\\\" hypothesis holds that pro-social preferences evolved genetically in our hunter-gatherer past where one-shot anonymous interactions were rare and these preferences are misapplied in modern laboratory settings. I compare these hypotheses by adopting a well-known model of the mismatch hypothesis and show that selection for one-shot cooperation in the model is an artifact of agents being constrained to only two strategies: Tit-for-Tat and Always Defect. Allowing for repentant and forgiving strategies reverses selection away from one-shot cooperation under all environmental parameters. Direct reciprocity does not necessarily lead to cooperation, but instead generates many different normative equilibria depending on a groups idiosyncratic evolutionary history. Therefore, an agent whose behavior is evoked solely from non-cultural environmental cues will be disadvantaged relative to an agent who learns the locally successful norms. Cooperation in one-shot laboratory experiments is thus more easily explained as the result of a psychology evolved for learning social norms than as a genetic mismatch.",
