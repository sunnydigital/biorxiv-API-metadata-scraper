    "abstract": "With the advent of high-throughput measurement techniques, scientists and engineers are starting to grapple with massive data sets and encountering challenges with how to organize, process and extract information into meaningful structures. Multidimensional spatio-temporal biological data sets such as time series gene expression with various perturbations over different cell lines, or neural spike trains across many experimental trials, have the potential to acquire insight across multiple dimensions. For this potential to be realized, we need a suitable representation to understand the data. Since a wide range of experiments and the unknown complexity of the underlying system contribute to the heterogeneity of biological data, we propose a method based on Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), which is well suited for extracting principal components when there are corrupted observations. The proposed method provides us a new representation of these data sets in terms of a common and aberrant response. This representation might help users to acquire a new insight from data.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryOne of the most exciting trends and important themes in science and engineering involves the use of high-throughput measurement data. With different dimensions, for example, various perturbations, different doses of drug or cell lines characteristics, such multidimensional data sets enable us to understand commonalities and differences across multiple dimensions. A general question is how to organize the observed data into meaningful structures and how to find an appropriate similarity measure. A natural way of viewing these complex high dimensional data sets is to examine and analyze the large-scale features and then to focus on the interesting details. With this notion, we propose an RPCA-based method which models common variations as approximately the low-rank component and anomalies as the sparse component. We show that the proposed method is able to find distinct subtypes and classify data sets in a robust way without any prior knowledge by separating these common responses and abnormal responses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAsthma as chronic inflammatory airway disease is considered to be the most common chronic disease that is involving genetic and environmental factors. Toll like receptors (TLRs) and other inflammatory mediators are important in modulation of inflammation. In this study we evaluated the role of TLR2 Arg753Gln and TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphisms in the asthma susceptibility, progress, control levels and lung functions in Iranian subjects.\\n\\nMethodsOn 99 asthmatic patients and 120 normal subjects, TLR2 Arg753Gln and TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism were evaluated by PCR-RFLP method recruiting Msp1 and Nco1 restriction enzymes, respectively. IgE serum levels by ELISA technique were determined and asthma diagnosis, treatment and control levels were considered using standard schemes and criteria.\\n\\nResultsOur results indicated that the genotype and allele frequencies of the TLR2 Arg753Gln and TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphisms were not significantly different between control subjects and asthmatics (p > 0.05) or even in asthma features such as IgE levels, asthma history and pulmonary factors (p > 0.05).\\n\\nConclusionsMeanwhile some previous studies indicated TLRs and their polymorphisms role in asthma incidence and features, our data demonstrated that TLR2 Arg753Gln and TLR4 Asp299Gly gene variants were not risk factor of asthma or its features in Iranian patients. Genetic complexity, ethnicity, influence of other genes or polymorphisms may overcome these polymorphisms in our asthmatics.",

    "abstract": "The discovery and study of a vast number of regulatory RNAs in all kingdoms of life over the past decades has allowed the design of new synthetic RNAs that can regulate gene expression in vivo. Riboregulators, in particular, have been used to activate or repress gene expression. However, to accelerate and scale up the design process, synthetic biologists require computer-assisted design tools, without which riboregulator engineering will remain a case-by-case design process requiring expert attention. Recently, the design of RNA circuits by evolutionary computation and adapting strand displacement techniques from nanotechnology has proven to be suited to the automated generation of DNA sequences implementing regulatory RNA systems in bacteria. Herein, we present our method to carry out such evolutionary design and how to use it to create various types of riboregulators, allowing the systematic de novo design of genetic control systems in synthetic biology.",
