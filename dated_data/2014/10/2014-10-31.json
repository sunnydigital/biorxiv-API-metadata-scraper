    "abstract": "Making meaningful inferences from phylogenetic comparative data requires a meaningful model of trait evolution. It is thus important to determine whether the model is appropriate for the data and the question being addressed. One way to assess this is to ask whether the model provides a good statistical explanation for the variation in the data. To date, researchers have focused primarily on the explanatory power of a model relative to alternative models. Methods have been developed to assess the adequacy, or absolute explanatory power, of phylogenetic trait models but these have been restricted to specific models or questions. Here we present a general statistical framework for assessing the adequacy of phylogenetic trait models. We use our approach to evaluate the statistical performance of commonly used trait models on 337 comparative datasets covering three key Angiosperm functional traits. In general, the models we tested often provided poor statistical explanations for the evolution of these traits. This was true for many different groups and at many different scales. Whether such statistical inadequacy will qualitatively alter inferences draw from comparative datasets will depend on the context. Regardless, assessing model adequacy can provide interesting biological insights -- how and why a model fails to describe variation in a dataset gives us clues about what evolutionary processes may have driven trait evolution across time.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, the process of domestication is assumed to be initiated by people, involve few individuals and rely on reproductive isolation between wild and domestic forms. However, an emerging zooarcheological consensus depicts animal domestication as a long-term process without reproductive isolation or strong intentional selection. Here, we ask whether pig domestication followed a traditional linear model, or a complex, reticulate model as predicted by zooarcheologists. To do so, we fit models of domestication to whole genome data from over 100 wild and domestic pigs. We found that the assumptions of traditional models, such as reproductive isolation and strong domestication bottlenecks, are incompatible with the genetic data and provide support for the zooarcheological theory of a complex domestication process. In particular, gene-flow from wild to domestic pigs was a ubiquitous feature of the domestication of pigs. In addition, we show that despite gene-flow, the genomes of domestic pigs show strong signatures of selection at loci that affect behaviour and morphology. Specifically, our results are consistent with independent parallel sweeps in two independent domestication areas (China and Anatolia) at loci linked to morphological traits. We argue that recurrent selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenising effect of gene-flow from wild boars and created \\\"islands of domestication\\\" in the genome. Overall, our results suggest that genomic approaches that allow for more complex models of domestication to be embraced should be employed. The results from these studies will have significant ramifications for studies that attempt to infer the origin of domesticated animals.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThough animal domestication has traditionally been viewed as a human-directed process involving small populations of domestic animals and limited interbreeding between wild and domestic forms, but recent zooarcheological insights have questioned this model. By studying domestication in pigs, we demonstrate that complex models of domestication incorporating long-term gene-flow from multiple wild boar populations fit genomic data from modern wild and domestic pigs significantly better than models based on the traditional perspective. In addition, we demonstrate that selection at genes associated with domestic traits countered the effects of the gene flow, thus allowing morphological and behavioural differentiation between wild and domestic populations to be maintained.",

But, after forty years, there is still no consensus about the nature of such a putative canonical computation, and little evidence that such uniform architectures can capture the diversity of cortical function in simple mammals, let alone language and abstract thinking (Hadley, 2009; Marcus, 2001). As we suggest in (Marcus, Marblestone, & Dean, 2014), an alternative is that the cortex might consist of a diverse set of computationally distinct building blocks that implement a broad range of elementary, reusable computations.\\n\\nSensory cortex, for example, might be r ...",

    "abstract": "Clozapine is the only evidence-based therapy for treatment resistant schizophrenia, but it induces agranulocytosis, a rare but potentially fatal haematological adverse reaction, in less than 1% of users. To improve safety, the drug is subject to mandatory haematological monitoring throughout the course of treatment, which is burdensome for the patient and one of the main reasons clozapine is underused. Therefore, a pharmacogenetic test is clinically useful if it identifies a group of patients for whom the agranulocytosis risk is low enough to alleviate monitoring requirements. Assuming a genotypic marker stratifies patients into a high risk and a low risk group, we explore the relationship between test sensitivity, group size and agranulocytosis risk. High sensitivity minimizes the agranulocytosis risk in the low risk group and is essential for clinical utility, in particular in combination with a small high risk group.",
