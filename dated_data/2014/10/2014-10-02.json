    "abstract": "Recent cancer genome studies have identified numerous genomic alterations in cancer genomes. It is hypothesized that only a fraction of these genomic alterations drive the progression of cancer - often called driver mutations. Current sample sizes for cancer studies, often in the hundreds, are sufficient to detect pivotal drivers solely based on their high frequency of alterations. In cases where the alterations for a single function are distributed among multiple genes of a common pathway, however, single gene alteration frequencies might not be statistically significant. In such cases, we expect to observe that most samples are altered in only one of those alternative genes because additional alterations would not convey an additional selective advantage to the tumor. This leads to a mutual exclusion pattern of alterations, that can be exploited to identify these groups.\\n\\nWe developed a novel method for the identification of sets of mutually exclusive gene alterations in a signaling network. We scan the groups of genes with a common downstream effect, using a mutual exclusivity criterion that makes sure that each gene in the group significantly contributes to the mutual exclusivity pattern. We have tested the method on all available TCGA cancer genomics datasets, and detected multiple previously unreported alterations that show significant mutual exclusivity and are likely to be driver events.",

    "abstract": "While modern agriculture relies on genetic homogeneity in the field, some farmers grow genetically heterogeneous crops and exchange seeds. Such diversifying practices associated with seed recycling may allow adaptation of crops to their environment. This socio-genetical model constitutes an original experimental evolution design called On-Farm Dynamic Management (OFDM). Studying OFDM can help understanding how evolutionary mechanisms shape crop diversity submitted to diverse agro-environmental conditions. We studied a farmer-led initiative where a mixture of four French wheat landraces called \\\"Melange de Touselles\\\" (MDT) was created and distributed within a farmers network. Fifteen populations derived by farmers from the initial mixture were sampled after 2 to 7 generations of cultivation on their farm. Twenty-one space-time samples of 80 individuals were genotyped using 17 microsatellites markers and characterized for their heading date in a \\\"common-garden\\\" experiment. Gene polymorphism was studied using four markers located in ear-liness genes. An original network-based approach was developed to depict the particular and complex genetic structure of the landraces composing the mixture. A rapid differentiation of the mixture was detected, larger at the phenotypic and gene levels compared to the neutral genetic level, indicating a potential divergent selection. We identified two interacting selection processes: variation of the mixture component frequencies and evolution of the within-variety diversity, that shaped the standing variability available within the mixture. These results confirm that farmers practices increase genetic diversity and allow crop evolution, which is critical in the context of global change. OFDM appears as a promising model of crop experimental evolution.",

    "abstract": "Hundreds of wild-derived D. melanogaster genomes have been published, but rigorous comparisons across data sets are precluded by differences in alignment methodology. The most common approach to reference-based genome assembly is a single round of alignment followed by quality filtering and variant detection. We evaluated variations and extensions of this approach, and settled on an assembly strategy that utilizes two alignment programs and incorporates both SNPs and short indels to construct an updated reference for a second round of mapping prior to final variant detection. Utilizing this approach, we reassembled published D. melanogaster population genomic data sets (previous DPGP releases and the DGRP freeze 2.0), and added unpublished genomes from several sub-Saharan populations. Most notably, we present aligned data from phase 3 of the Drosophila Population Genomics Project (DPGP3), which provides 197 genomes from a single ancestral range population of D. melanogaster (from Zambia). The large sample size, high genetic diversity, and potentially simpler demographic history of the DPGP3 sample will make this a highly valuable resource for fundamental population genetic research. The complete set of assemblies described here, termed the Drosophila Genome Nexus, presently comprises 605 consistently aligned genomes, and is publicly available in multiple formats with supporting documentation and bioinformatic tools. This resource will greatly facilitate population genomic analysis in this model species by reducing the methodological differences between data sets.",
