    "abstract": "Sulfate-reducing bacteria play major roles in the global carbon and sulfur cycles, but it remains unclear how reducing sulfate yields energy. To determine the genetic basis of energy conservation, we measured the fitness of thousands of pooled mutants of Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 during growth in 12 different combinations of electron donors and acceptors. We show that ion pumping by the ferredoxin:NADH oxidoreductase Rnf is required whenever substrate-level phosphorylation is not possible. The uncharacterized complex Hdr/flox-1 (Dde_1207:13) is sometimes important alongside Rnf and may perform an electron bifurcation to generate more reduced ferredoxin from NADH to allow further ion pumping. Similarly, during the oxidation of malate or fumarate, the electron-bifurcating transhydrogenase NfnAB-2 (Dde_1250:1) is important and may generate reduced ferredoxin to allow additional ion pumping by Rnf. During formate oxidation, the periplasmic [NiFeSe] hydrogenase HysAB is required, which suggests that hydrogen forms in the periplasm, diffuses to the cytoplasm, and is used to reduce ferredoxin, thus providing a substrate for Rnf. During hydrogen utilization, the transmembrane electron transport complex Tmc is important and may move electrons from the periplasm into the cytoplasmic sulfite reduction pathway. Finally, mutants of many other putative electron carriers have no clear phenotype, which suggests that they are not important under our growth conditions.",

    "abstract": "Model organisms can serve the biological and medical community by enabling the study of conserved gene families and pathways in experimentally-tractable systems. Their use, however, hinges on the ability to reliably identify evolutionary orthologs and paralogs with high accuracy, which can be a great challenge at both small and large evolutionary distances. Here, we present a phylogenomics-based approach for the identification of orthologous and paralogous genes in human, mouse, fly, and worm, which forms the foundation of the comparative analyses of the modENCODE and mouse ENCODE projects. We study a median of 16,101 genes across 2 mammalian genomes (human, mouse), 12 Drosophila genomes, 5 Caenorhabditis genomes, and an outgroup yeast genome, and demonstrate that accurate inference of evolutionary relationships and events across these species must account for frequent gene-tree topology errors due to both incomplete lineage sorting and insufficient phylogenetic signal. Furthermore, we show that integration of two separate phylogenomic pipelines yields increased accuracy, suggesting that their sources of error are independent, and finally, we leverage the resulting annotation of homologous genes to study the functional impact of gene duplication and loss in the context of rich gene expression and functional genomic datasets of the modENCODE, mouse ENCODE, and human ENCODE projects.",

    "abstract": "The t(1,11) chromosome translocation co-segregates with major psychiatric disorders in a large Scottish family. The translocation disrupts the DISC1 and Boymaw (DISC1FP1) genes on chromosomes 1 and 11, respectively. After translocation, two fusion genes are generated. Our recent studies found that the DISC1-Boymaw fusion protein is localized in mitochondria and inhibits oxidoreductase activity, rRNA expression, and protein translation. Mice carrying the DISC1-Boymaw fusion genes display intermediate behavioral phenotypes related to major psychiatric disorders. Here, we report that the Boymaw gene encodes a small protein predominantly localized in mitochondria. The Boymaw protein inhibits oxidoreductase activity, rRNA expression, and protein translation in the same way as the DISC1-Boymaw fusion protein. Interestingly, Boymaw expression is up-regulated by different stressors at RNA and/or protein translational levels. In addition, we found that Boymaw RNA expression is significantly increased in the postmortem brains of patients with major psychiatric disorders. Our studies therefore suggest that the Boymaw gene is a potential susceptibility gene for major psychiatric disorders in both the Scottish t(1,11) family and the general population of patients.",

    "abstract": "The t(1; 11) translocation appears to be the causal genetic lesion with 70% penetrance for schizophrenia, major depression, and other psychiatric disorders in a Scottish family. Molecular studies identified the disruption of the DISC1 (disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1) gene by chromosome translocation at chromosome 1q42. Our previous studies, however, revealed that the translocation also disrupted another gene, Boymaw (also termed DISC1FP1), on chromosome 11. After translocation, two fusion genes (the DISC1-Boymaw (DB7) and the Boymaw-DISC1 (BD13)) are generated between the DISC1 and Boymaw genes. In the present study, we report that expression of the DB7 fusion gene inhibits both intracellular NADH oxidoreductase activities and protein translation. We generated humanized DISC1-Boymaw mice with gene targeting to examine the in vivo functions of the fusion genes. Consistent with the in vitro studies on the DB7 fusion gene, protein translation activity is decreased in the hippocampus and in cultured primary neurons from the brains of the humanized mice. Expression of Gad67, Nmdar1, and Psd95 proteins are also reduced. The humanized mice display prolonged and increased responses to the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, on various mouse genetic backgrounds. Abnormal information processing of acoustic startle and depressive-like behaviors are also observed. In addition, the humanized mice display abnormal erythropoiesis, which was reported to associate with depression in humans. Expression of the DB7 fusion gene may reduce protein translation to impair brain functions and thereby contribute to the pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "A novel genome-wide genetics platform is presented in this study, which permits functional interrogation of all point mutations across a viral genome in parallel. Here we generated the first fitness profile of individual point mutations across the influenza virus genome. Critical residues on the viral genome were systematically identified, which provided a collection of subdomain data informative for structure-function studies and for effective rational drug and vaccine design. Our data was consistent with known, well-characterized structural features. In addition, we have achieved a validation rate of 68% for severely attenuated mutations and 94% for neutral mutations. The approach described in this study is applicable to other viral or microbial genomes where a means of genetic manipulation is available.",
