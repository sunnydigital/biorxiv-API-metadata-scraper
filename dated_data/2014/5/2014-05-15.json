    "abstract": "The {beta}-lactamase produces by Aeromonas hydrophila which enables to hydrolyze and inactivate {beta}- lactam ring of antibiotics. The homology modeling was used to generate the 3-D model of {beta}-lactamase by using known template 3-D structure. The stereochemical quality and torsion angle of 3-D model were validated. Total eleven effective drugs have been selected and targeted the active amino acid residues in {beta}-lactamase. The drugs were derivative of {beta}-lactam ring antibiotics and screening was made by docking. Out of 11 drugs, 3 drugs (Ampicillin, Astreonam and Sultamicillin) were found to be more potent on the basis of robust binding energy between protein-drug interactions. Additionally, homology of {beta}-lactamase of A. hydrophila resembled with other pathogenic bacteria that used for phylogeny analysis. These findings suggest a new insight for better understanding and useful for designing of novel potent drugs.",

    "abstract": "Dissociated mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were cultured to form aggregates in small volumes of basal medium in U-bottomed, non tissue-culture-treated 96-well plates and subsequently maintained in suspension culture. After growth for 48 hours, the aggregates are competent to respond to ubiquitous experimental signals which result in their symmetry-breaking and generation of defined polarised structures by 96 hours. It is envisaged that this system can be applied both to the study of early developmental events and more broadly to the processes of self-organisation and cellular decision-making. It may also provide a suitable niche for the generation of cell types present in the embryo but unobtainable from conventional adherent culture.",
