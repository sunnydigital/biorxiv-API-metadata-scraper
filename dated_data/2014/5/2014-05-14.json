    "abstract": "Gene Ontology (GO) classification of statistically significant over/under expressed genes is a commonly used to interpret transcriptomics data in functional genomic analysis. In this approach, all significant genes contribute equally to the final GO classification regardless of their actual expression levels. However, the original level of gene expression can significantly affect protein production and consequently GO term enrichment, and genes with low expression levels can participate in the final GO enrichment through cumulative effects. In addition, GO terms have regulatory relationships that allow the construction of a regulatory network that incorporates gene expression levels to better study biological mechanisms. In this report, we have used gene expression levels in bacteria to determine GO term enrichments. This approach provided the opportunity to enrich GO terms across the entire transcriptome (instead of a subset of differentially expressed genes). In the second part, we show a dynamically developed enriched interaction network between Biological Process GO terms for any gene samples. This type of network presents regulatory relationships between GO terms and their genes. We then demonstrate the efficiency of these methods using public data from two important bacterial pathogens as models. We also explain how these methods help us understand potential pathogenesis mechanisms employed by these bacteria.",

    "abstract": "MotivationEfficient simulation of population genetic samples under a given demographic model is a prerequisite for many analyses. Coalescent theory provides an efficient framework for such simulations, but simulating longer regions and higher recombination rates remains challenging. Simulators based on a Markovian approximation to the coalescent scale well, but do not support simulation of selection. Gene conversion is not supported by any published coalescent simulators that support selection.\\n\\nResultsWe describe cosi2, an efficient simulator that supports both exact and approximate coalescent simulation with positive selection. cosi2 improves on the speed of existing exact simulators, and permits further speedup in approximate mode while retaining support for selection. cosi2 supports a wide range of demographic scenarios including recombination hot spots, gene conversion, population size changes, population structure and migration.\\n\\ncosi2 implements coalescent machinery efficiently by tracking only a small subset of the Ancestral Recombination Graph, sampling only relevant recombination events, and using augmented skip lists to represent tracked genetic segments. To preserve support for selection in approximate mode, the Markov approximation is implemented not by moving along the chromosome but by performing a standard backwards-in-time coalescent simulation while restricting coalescence to node pairs with overlapping or near-overlapping genetic material. We describe the algorithms used by cosi2 and present comparisons with existing selection simulators.\\n\\nAvailabilityA free C++ implementation of cosi2 is available at http://broadinstitute.org/[~]ilya/cosi2.\\n\\nContactilya@broadinstitute.org",

    "abstract": "The {beta}-lactamase produces by Aeromonas hydrophila which enables to hydrolyze and inactivate {beta}- lactam ring of antibiotics. The homology modeling was used to generate the 3-D model of {beta}-lactamase by using known template 3-D structure. The stereochemical quality and torsion angle of 3-D model were validated. Total eleven effective drugs have been selected and targeted the active amino acid residues in {beta}-lactamase. The drugs were derivative of {beta}-lactam ring antibiotics and screening was made by docking. Out of 11 drugs, 3 drugs (Ampicillin, Astreonam and Sultamicillin) were found to be more potent on the basis of robust binding energy between protein-drug interactions. Additionally, homology of {beta}-lactamase of A. hydrophila resembled with other pathogenic bacteria that used for phylogeny analysis. These findings suggest a new insight for better understanding and useful for designing of novel potent drugs.",

    "abstract": "Accurately quantifying gene expression levels is a key goal of experiments using RNA-sequencing to assay the transcriptome. This typically requires aligning the short reads generated to the genome or transcriptome before quantifying expression of pre-defined sets of genes. Differences in the alignment/quantification tools can have a major effect upon the expression levels found with important consequences for biological interpretation. Here we address two main issues: do different analysis pipelines affect the gene expression levels inferred from RNA-seq data? And, how close are the expression levels inferred to the \\\"true\\\" expression levels?\\n\\nWe evaluate fifty gene profiling pipelines in experimental and simulated data sets with different characteristics (e.g, read length and sequencing depth). In the absence of knowledge of the  ground truth in real RNAseq data sets, we used simulated data to assess the differences between the \\\"true\\\" expression and those reconstructed by the analysis pipelines. Even though this approach does not take into account all known biases present in RNAseq data, it still allows to estimate the accuracy of the gene expression values inferred by different analysis pipelines. The results show that i) overall there is a high correlation between the expression levels inferred by the best pipelines and the true quantification values; ii) the error in the estimated gene expression values can vary considerably across genes; and iii) a small set of genes have expression estimates with consistently high error (across data sets and methods). Finally, although the mapping software is important, the quantification method makes a greater difference to the results.",

    "abstract": "Efficient regulation of internal homeostasis and defending it against perturbations requires complex behavioral strategies. However, the computational principles mediating brains homeostatic regulation of reward and associative learning remain undefined. Here we use a definition of primary rewards, as outcomes fulfilling physiological needs, to build a normative theory showing how learning motivated behavior is modulated by the internal state of the animal. The theory proves that seeking rewards is equivalent to the fundamental objective of physiological stability, defining the notion of physiological rationality of behavior. We further give a formal basis for temporal discounting of reward. It also explains how animals learn to act predictively to preclude prospective homeostatic challenges, and attributes a normative computational role to the modulation of midbrain dopaminergic activity by hypothalamic signals.",

    "abstract": "Structural variation in the genome is common due to insertions, deletions, duplications and rearrangements. However, little is known about the ways structural variants impact gene expression. Developmental genes are controlled by multiple regulatory sequence elements scattered over thousands of bases; developmental loci are therefore a good model to test the functional impact of structural variation on gene expression. Here, we measured the effect of rearranging two developmental enhancers from the even-skipped (eve) locus in Drosophila melanogaster blastoderm embryos. We systematically varied orientation, order, and spacing of the enhancers in transgenic reporter constructs and measured expression quantitatively at single cell resolution in whole embryos to detect changes in both level and position of expression. We found that the position of expression was robust to changes in locus organization, but levels of expression were highly sensitive to the spacing between enhancers and order relative to the promoter. Our data demonstrate that changes in locus architecture can dramatically impact levels of gene expression. To quantitatively predict gene expression from sequence, we must therefore consider how information is integrated both within enhancers and across gene loci.",
