    "abstract": "Lighter is a fast, memory-efficient tool for correcting sequencing errors. Lighter avoids counting k-mers. Instead, it uses a pair of Bloom filters, one holding a sample of the input k-mers and the other holding k-mers likely to be correct. As long as the sampling fraction is adjusted in inverse proportion to the depth of sequencing, Bloom filter size can be held constant while maintaining near-constant accuracy. Lighter is parallelized, uses no secondary storage, and is both faster and more memory-efficient than competing approaches while achieving comparable accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In order to compare stand structure and woody species diversity of subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests along a latitudinal thermal gradient of the Ryukyu Archipelago, tree censuses in a 750 m2 plot in Okinawa Island and a 400 m2 plot in Ishigaki Island were performed. The number of layers increased along a latitudinal thermal gradient from four in the forest of Okinawa Island to five in the forest of Ishigaki Island. The values of Shannons index H' and Pielous index J' tended to increase from the top layer downward in the forest of Okinawa Island, whereas in the forest of Ishigaki Island, these values tended to increase from the bottom layer upward. High woody species diversity depended on small-sized trees in the Okinawa forest, whereas it depended on large-sized trees in the Ishigaki forest. The woody species diversity is higher in the Okinawa forest (H' = 4.83 bit) than in the Ishigaki forest (H' = 4.36 bit). According to successively decreasing height of layers from the top downward, the value of H' increased continuously from the top layer downward in the Okinawa forest. This increasing trend was different from the Ishigaki forest, where the value of H' increased up to the second layer and then decreased downward. In the Okinawa forest, the expected number of species increased continuously from the top toward the bottom layer, i.e. the bottom layer contained the highest potential number of species (65). However, in the Ishigaki forest, it increased from the top to the fourth layer and then decreased to the bottom layer, i.e. the fourth layer contained the highest potential number of species (90). The floristic composition in the Okinawa forest was different from that in the Ishigaki forest in terms of similarity index, though approximately half of the species were common between them. The highest degree of similarity in floristic composition was between the second and third layers in the Okinawa forest, whereas it was between the third and bottom layers in the Ishigaki forest. The degree of similarity in floristic composition among layers was higher in the Okinawa forest than in the Ishigaki forest. Except the top and the bottom layer respectively in the forests of Okinawa Island and Ishigaki Island, the spatial distribution of trees was random in each layer. The degree of overlapping in the spatial distribution of trees among layers in these two forests suggested that trees in the upper two layers in the Ishigaki forest can catch sufficient light, while light can not penetrate easily to the lower three layers in both of the forests. As a result, almost species in the lower layers might be shade-tolerant in both of the forests. For both of the forests, mean tree weight of each layer decreased from the top downward, whereas the corresponding tree density increased from the top downward. This trend resembled the mean weight-density trajectory of self-thinning plant populations.",

    "abstract": "The effects of historical barriers in biogeographical patterns are expected to persist differently depending on dispersal abilities of organisms. We tested two hypotheses that plant groups with different dispersal abilities display different floristic patterns, and that historical barriers can explain floristic differentiation patterns in plants with low dispersal ability but not in plants with higher dispersal ability, in the seed plant flora of the Ryukyu Archipelago. This area is biogeographically interesting because several similar floristic differentiation patterns have been proposed, all of which are primarily explained by two historical barriers, the Tokara Tectonic Strait (Tokara Gap) and the Kerama Gap, which arose during the formation of the islands. We calculated floristic dissimilarity distance among 26 islands based on data sets for three dispersal-ability classes. Clustering analyses based on the floristic dissimilarity distance generated similar floristic patterns regardless of dispersal-ability class. We propose that because the landscape resistance is so strong that migration of plants is severely restricted regardless of their dispersal abilities, the similar floristic differentiation patterns are generated. Multivariate regression analyses using Mantels randomization test indicated that floristic differentiations among islands were explained by the both effects of the historical barriers and geographic distance in all dispersal-ability classes. Significance of the historical barriers is not determined by the plant dispersal abilities but presumably by the spatial distribution of the islands, stochastic dispersals, and time since the formation of the barriers.",

    "abstract": "The nascent stages of speciation start with the emergence of sexual isolation. Understanding the influence of reproductive barriers in this evolutionary process is an ongoing effort. We present a study of Drosophila melanogaster populations from the southeast United States and Caribbean islands undergoing incipient sexual isolation. The existence of premating reproductive barriers have been previously established, but these types of barriers are not the only source shaping sexual isolation. To assess the influence of postmating barriers, we investigated putative postmating barriers of female remating and egg laying behavior, as well as hatchability of eggs laid and female longevity after mating. In the central region of our putative hybrid zone of American and Caribbean populations, we observed lower hatchability of eggs laid accompanied by increased resistance to harm after mating to less related males. These results illustrate that postmating reproductive barriers acting alongside premating barriers in a complex secondary contact zone. Furthermore, our findings suggest hybrid incompatibilities, likely due to the nature of genomic admixture of populations in the area, are influential even at the early phases of sexual isolation.",

    "abstract": "Santa Catalina Island is a small island off the coast of southern California and for its modest size harbors several species of flies from the Drosophila genus. We performed an island-wide survey of Drosophila species to ascertain which species were endemic to the island and where they were most abundant. In doing so, we have assembled useful sampling information for researchers who wish to conduct field studies on Santa Catalina Island. From this survey, we determined that Drosophila hamatofila, Drosophila mainlandi, and Drosophila mettleri were the prominent repleta species on the island. Other repleta species encountered included Drosophila mojavensis and Drosophila wheeleri. Non-repleta species sighted on the island include Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, Drosophila simulans, and an unknown species not seen before on the island. Additionally, we performed seasonal collections at two locations on the island and observed that species abundance and composition at these two sites vary between seasons. One of the seasonal sites was sampled in two consecutive summer seasons, which revealed that species composition had shifted between years, but relative species abundances were approximately the same.",

    "abstract": "A major bottleneck in biological discovery is now emerging at the computational level. Cloud computing offers a dynamic means whereby small and medium-sized laboratories can rapidly adjust their computational capacity. We benchmarked two established cloud computing services, Amazon Web Services Elastic MapReduce (EMR) on Amazon EC2 instances and Google Compute Engine (GCE), using publicly available genomic datasets (E.coli CC102 strain and a Han Chinese male genome) and a standard bioinformatic pipeline on a Hadoop-based platform. Wall-clock time for complete assembly differed by 52.9% (95%CI: 27.5-78.2) for E.coli and 53.5% (95%CI: 34.4-72.6) for human genome, with GCE being more efficient than EMR. The cost of running this experiment on EMR and GCE differed significantly, with the costs on EMR being 257.3% (95%CI: 211.5-303.1) and 173.9% (95%CI: 134.6-213.1) more expensive for E.coli and human assemblies respectively. Thus, GCE was found to outperform EMR both in terms of cost and wall-clock time. Our findings confirm that cloud computing is an efficient and potentially cost-effective alternative for analysis of large genomic datasets. In addition to releasing our cost-effectiveness comparison, we present available ready-to-use scripts for establishing Hadoop instances with Ganglia monitoring on EC2 or GCE.",
