    "abstract": "Engineering multi-protein genetic systems to maximize their performance remains a combinatorial challenge, particularly when measurement throughput is limited. We have developed a computational design and modeling approach to build predictive models and identify optimal expression levels, while circumventing combinatorial explosion. Maximally informative genetic system variants are first designed by the RBS Library Calculator, an algorithm that optimizes the smallest ribosome binding site library to efficiently search the expression space across a >10,000-fold range with tailored search resolutions, sequence constraints, and well-predicted translation rates. We validated the algorithms predictions using a 644 sequence data-set, within single and multi-protein genetic systems, modifying plasmids and genomes, and in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. We then combined the search algorithm with kinetic modeling to map the mechanistic relationship between sequence, expression, and overall activity for a 3-enzyme biosynthesis pathway, requiring only 73 measurements to forward design highly productive pathway variants. The combination of sequence desi gn and systems modeling accelerates the optimization of many-protein systems, and allow previous measurements to quantitatively inform future designs.",

    "abstract": "Biological organisms acclimatize to varying environmental conditions via active self-regulation of internal gene regulatory networks, metabolic networks, and protein signaling networks. While much work has been done to elucidate the topologies of individual networks in isolation, understanding of inter-network regulatory mechanisms remains limited. This shortcoming is of particular relevance to synthetic biology. Synthetic biological circuits tend to lose their engineered functionality over generational time, primarily due to the deleterious stress that they exert on their host organisms. To reduce this stress (and thus minimize loss of functionality) synthetic circuits must be sensitive to the health of the host organism. Development of integrated regulatory systems is therefore essential to robust synthetic biological systems. The aim of this study was to develop integrated gene-regulatory and metabolic networks which self-optimize in response to varying environmental conditions. We performed in silico evolution to develop such networks using a two-step approach: (1) We optimized metabolic networks given a constrained amount of available enzyme. Here, we found that a proportional relationship between flux control coefficients and enzyme mass holds in all linear sub-networks of branched networks, except those sub-networks which contain allosteric regulators. Network optimization was performed by iteratively redistributing enzyme until flux through the network was maximized. Optimization was performed for a range of boundary metabolite conditions to develop a profile of optimal enzyme distributions as a function of environmental conditions. (2) We generated and evolved randomized gene regulatory networks to modulate the enzymes of a target metabolic pathway. The objective of the gene regulatory networks was to produce the optimal distribution of metabolic network enzymes given specific boundary metabolite conditions of the target network. Competitive evolutionary algorithms were applied to optimize the specific structures and kinetic parameters of the gene regulatory networks. With this method, we demonstrate the possibility of algorithmic development of integrated adaptive gene and metabolic regulatory networks which dynamically self-optimize in response to changing environmental conditions.",
