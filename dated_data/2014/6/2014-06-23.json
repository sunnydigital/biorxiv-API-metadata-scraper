    "abstract": "Influenza is notable for its evolutionary capacity to escape immunity targeting the viral hemagglutinin. We used deep mutational scanning to examine the extent to which a high inherent mutational tolerance contributes to this antigenic evolvability. We created mutant viruses that incorporate most of the {approx} 104 amino-acid mutations to hemagglutinin from A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) influenza. After passaging these viruses in tissue culture to select for functional variants, we used deep sequencing to quantify mutation frequencies before and after selection. These data enable us to infer the preference for each amino acid at each site in hemagglutinin. These inferences are consistent with existing knowledge about the proteins structure and function, and can be used to create a model that describes hemagglutinins evolution far better than existing phylogenetic models. We show that hemagglutinin has a high inherent tolerance for mutations at antigenic sites, suggesting that this is one factor contributing to influenzas antigenic evolution.",

    "abstract": "In this study Markov chain models of gene regulatory networks (GRN) are developed. These models gives the ability to apply the well known theory and tools of Markov chains to GRN analysis. We introduce a new kind of the finite graph of the interactions called the combinatorial net that formally represent a GRN and the transition graphs constructed from interaction graphs. System dynamics are defined as a random walk on the transition graph that is some Markovian chain. A novel concurrent updating scheme (evolution rule) is developed to determine transitions in a transition graph. Our scheme is based on the firing of a random set of non-steady state vertices of a combinatorial net. We demonstrate that this novel scheme gives an advance in the modeling of the asynchronicity. Also we proof the theorem that the combinatorial nets with this updating scheme can asynchronously compute a maximal independent sets of graphs. As proof of concept, we present here a number of simple combinatorial models: a discrete model of auto-repression, a bi-stable switch, the Elowitz repressilator, a self-activation and show that this models exhibit well known properties.",

    "abstract": "Building better models of cellular pathways is one of the major challenges of systems biology and functional genomics. There is a need for methods to build on established expert knowledge and reconcile it with results of high-throughput studies. Moreover, the available data sources are heterogeneous and need to be combined in a way specific for the part of the pathway in which they are most informative. Here, we present a compartment specific strategy to integrate edge, node and path data for the refinement of a network hypothesis. Specifically, we use a local-move Gibbs sampler for refining pathway hypotheses from a compendium of heterogeneous data sources, including novel methodology for integrating protein attributes. We demonstrate the utility of this approach in a case study of the pheromone response MAPK pathway in the yeast S. cerevisiae.",
