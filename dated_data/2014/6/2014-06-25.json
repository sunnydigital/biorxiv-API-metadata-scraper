    "abstract": "Transmembrane {beta}-barrels are known to play major roles in substrate transport and protein biogenesis in gram-negative bacteria, chloroplasts and mitochondria. However, the exact number of transmembrane {beta}-barrel families is unknown and experimental structure determination is challenging. In theory, if one knows the number of strands in the {beta}-barrel, then the 3D structure of the barrel could be trivial, but current topology predictions do not predict accurate structures and are unable to give information beyond the {beta}-strands in the barrel. Recent work has shown successful prediction of globular and alpha-helical membrane proteins from sequence alignments, by using high ranked evolutionary couplings between residues as distance constraints to fold extended polypeptides. However, these methods, have not addressed the calculation of precise {beta}-sheet hydrogen bonding that defines transmembrane {beta}-barrels, and would be required to fold these proteins successfully. Hence we developed a method (EVFold_BB) that can successfully model transmembrane {beta}-barrels by combining evolutionary couplings together with topology predictions. EVFold_BB is validated by the accurate all-atom 3D modeling of 18 proteins, representing all known membrane {beta}-barrel families that have sufficient sequences available. To demonstrate the potential of our approach we predict the unknown 3D structure of the LptD protein, the plausibility of its accuracy is supported by the blindly predicted benchmarks, and is consistent with experimental observations. Our approach can naturally be extended to all unknown {beta}-barrel proteins with sufficient sequence information.",

    "abstract": "It is now well known that unwanted noise and unmodeled artifacts such as batch effects can dramatically reduce the accuracy of statistical inference in genomic experiments. We introduced surrogate variable analysis for estimating these artifacts by (1) identifying the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts and (2) estimating the artifacts with principal components or singular vectors of the subset of the data matrix. The resulting estimates of artifacts can be used in subsequent analyses as adjustment factors. Here I describe an update to the sva approach that can be applied to analyze count data or FPKMs from sequencing experiments. I also describe the addition of supervised sva (ssva) for using control probes to identify the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts. These updates are available through the surrogate variable analysis (sva) Bioconductor package.",

How the energetic demands of such processes are ensured in response to rapid stimuli remains unclear. We have analyzed this question in the context of the massive gene regulation changes induced by progestins in breast cancer cells and found that ATP is generated in the cell nucleus via the hydrolysis of poly-ADP-ribose to ADP-ribose. Nuclear ATP synthesis requires the combined enzymatic activities of PARP1, PARG and NUDIX5/NUDT5. Although initiated via mitochondrial derived ATP, the nuclear source of ATP is essential for hormone induced chromatin remodeling, gene regulation and cell proliferation and may also participate in DNA repair. This novel pathway reveals exciting avenues of research for drug development.",

    "abstract": "Fulfilling the promise of the genetic revolution requires the analysis of large datasets containing information from thousands to millions of participants. However, sharing human genomic data requires protecting subjects from potential harm. Current models rely on de-identification techniques that treat privacy versus data utility as a zero-sum game. Instead we propose using trust-enabling techniques to create a solution where researchers and participants both win. To do so we introduce three principles that facilitate trust in genetic research and outline one possible framework built upon those principles. Our hope is that such trust-centric frameworks provide a sustainable solution that reconciles genetic privacy with data sharing and facilitates genetic research.",

    "abstract": "Modification of spatial attention via reinforcement learning (Lee & Shomstein, 2013) requires the integration of reward, attention, and executive processes. Corticostriatal pathways are an ideal neural substrate for this integration because these projections exhibit a globally parallel (Alexander, De Long, and Strick, 1985), but locally overlapping (Haber, 2003), topographical organization. Here, we explored whether there are unique striatal regions that exhibit convergent anatomical connections from orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and posterior parietal cortex. Deterministic fiber tractography on diffusion spectrum imaging data from neurologically healthy adults (N=60) was used to map fronto-and parieto-striatal projections. In general, projections from cortex were organized in a rostral-caudal gradient along the striatal nuclei; however, we also identified two bilateral convergence zones--one in the caudate nucleus and another in the putamen--that consisted of voxels with projections from OFC, DLPFC, and parietal regions. The distributed cortical connectivity of these striatal convergence zones was confirmed with follow-up functional connectivity analysis from resting state fMRI data from 55 of the participants, in which a high percentage (62-80%) of structurally connected voxels also showed significant functional connectivity. These results delineate a neurologically plausible network of converging corticostriatal projections that may support the integration of reward, executive control, and spatial attention that occurs during spatial reinforcement learning.",
