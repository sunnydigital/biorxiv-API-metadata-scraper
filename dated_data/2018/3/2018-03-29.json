    "abstract": "Examining how the landscape may influence gene flow is at the forefront of understanding population differentiation and adaptation. Such understanding is crucial in light of ongoing environmental changes and the elevated risk of ecosystems alteration. In particular, knowledge of how humans may influence the structure of populations is imperative to allow for informed decisions in management and conservation as well as to gain a better understanding of anthropogenic impacts on the interplay between gene flow, genetic drift and selection. Here we use genome-wide molecular markers to characterize the population genetic structure and connectivity of Ipomoea purpurea, a noxious invasive weed. We likewise assess the interaction between natural and human-driven influences on genetic differentiation among populations. Our analyses find that human population density is an important predictor of pairwise population differentiation, suggesting that the agricultural and/or horticultural trade may be involved in maintaining some level of connectivity across distant agricultural fields. Climatic variation appears as an additional predictor of genetic connectivity in this species. We discuss the implications of these results and highlight future research needed to disentangle the mechanistic processes underlying population connectivity of weeds.",

    "abstract": "Psychiatric illness is unlikely to arise from pathology occurring uniformly across all cell types in affected brain regions. Despite this, transcriptomic analyses of the human brain have typically been conducted using macro-dissected tissue due to the difficulty of performing single-cell type analyses with donated post-mortem brains. To address this issue statistically, we compiled a database of several thousand transcripts that were specifically-enriched in one of 10 primary cortical cell types in previous publications. Using this database, we predicted the relative cell type composition for 833 human cortical samples using microarray or RNA-Seq data from the Pritzker Consortium (GSE92538) or publicly-available databases (GSE53987, GSE21935, GSE21138, CommonMind Consortium). These predictions were generated by averaging normalized expression levels across transcripts specific to each cell type using our R-package BrainInABlender (validated and publicly-released: https://github.com/hagenaue/BrainInABlender). Using this method, we found that the principal components of variation in the datasets strongly correlated with the neuron to glia ratio of the samples.\\n\\nThis variability was not simply due to dissection - the relative balance of brain cell types appeared to be influenced by a variety of demographic, pre- and post-mortem variables. Prolonged hypoxia around the time of death predicted increased astrocytic and endothelial gene expression, illustrating vascular upregulation. Aging was associated with decreased neuronal gene expression. Red blood cell gene expression was reduced in individuals who died following systemic blood loss. Subjects with Major Depressive Disorder had decreased astrocytic gene expression, mirroring previous morphometric observations. Subjects with Schizophrenia had reduced red blood cell gene expression, resembling the hypofrontality detected in fMRI experiments. Finally, in datasets containing samples with especially variable cell content, we found that controlling for predicted sample cell content while evaluating differential expression improved the detection of previously-identified psychiatric effects. We conclude that accounting for cell type can greatly improve the interpretability of transcriptomic data.",

We propose to use effective and expressed nucleotide variations (eeSNVs) from scRNA-seq as alternative features for tumor subpopulation identification. We developed a linear modeling framework, SSrGE, to link eeSNVs associated with gene expression. In all the datasets tested, eeSNVs achieve better accuracies than gene expression for identifying subpopulations. Previously validated cancer-relevant genes are also highly ranked, confirming the significance of the method. Moreover, SSrGE is capable of analyzing coupled DNA-seq and RNA-seq data from the same single cells, demonstrating its value in integrating multi-omics single cell techniques. In summary, SNV features from scRNA-seq data have merits for both subpopulation identification and linkage of genotype-phenotype relationship.

    "abstract": "mRNA translation plays an evolutionarily conserved role in homeostasis and when dysregulated results in various disorders. Optimal and universally applicable analytical methods to study transcriptome-wide changes in translational efficiency are therefore critical for understanding the complex role of translation regulation under physiological and pathological conditions. Techniques used to interrogate translatomes, including polysome- and ribosome-profiling, require adjustment for changes in total mRNA levels to capture bona fide alterations in translational efficiency. Herein, we present the anota2seq algorithm for such analysis using data from ribosome- or polysome-profiling quantified by DNA-microarrays or RNA sequencing, which outperforms current methods for identification of changes in translational efficiency. In contrast to available analytical methods, anota2seq also allows capture of an underappreciated mode for regulation of gene expression whereby translation acts as a buffering mechanism which maintains constant protein levels despite fluctuations in mRNA levels (\\\"translational buffering\\\"). Application of anota2seq shows that insulin affects gene expression at multiple levels, in a largely mTOR-dependent manner. Moreover, insulin induces levels of a subset of mRNAs independently of mTOR that undergo translational buffering upon mTOR inhibition. Thus, the universal anota2seq algorithm allows efficient and hitherto unprecedented interrogation of translatomes and enables studies of translational buffering which represents an unexplored mechanism for regulating of gene expression.",

As the majority of these animals are migratory, their utility to interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of the magnetic sense is limited. Vidal-Gadea and colleagues recently argued that the worm C. elegans possesses a magnetic sense that guides their vertical movement in soil. In making this claim they relied on three different behavioural assays that involved magnetic stimuli. Here, we set out to replicate their results employing blinded protocols and double wrapped coils that control for heat generation. We find no evidence supporting the existence of a magnetic sense in C. elegans. We further show that the Vidal-Gadea hypothesis is problematic as the adoption of a correction angle and a fixed trajectory relative to the Earths magnetic inclination does not necessarily result in vertical movement.",

    "abstract": "During embryonic development, cells undertake a series of fate decisions to form a complete organism comprised of various cell types, epitomising a branching process. A striking example of branching occurs in humans around the time of implantation, when primordial germ cells (PGCs), precursors of sperm and eggs, and somatic lineages are specified. Due to inaccessibility of human embryos at this stage of development, understanding the mechanisms of PGC specification remains difficult. The integrative modelling of single cell transcriptomics data from embryos and appropriate in vitro models should prove to be a useful resource for investigating this system, provided that the cells can be suitably ordered over a developmental axis. Unfortunately, most methods for inferring cell ordering were not designed with structured (time series) data in mind. Although some probabilistic approaches address these limitations by incorporating prior information about the developmental stage (capture time) of the cell, they do not allow the ordering of cells over processes with more than one terminal cell fate. To investigate the mechanisms of PGC specification, we develop a probabilistic pseudotime approach, branch-recombinant Gaussian process latent variable models (B-RGPLVMs), that use an explicit model of transcriptional branching in individual marker genes, allowing the ordering of cells over developmental trajectories with arbitrary numbers of branches. We use first demonstrate the advantage of our approach over existing pseudotime algorithms and subsequently use it to investigate early human development, as primordial germ cells (PGCs) and somatic cells diverge. We identify known master regulators of human PGCs, and predict roles for a variety of signalling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifiers. By concentrating on the earliest branched signalling events, we identified an antagonistic role for FGF receptor (FGFR) signalling pathway in the acquisition of competence for human PGC fate, and identify putative roles for PRC1 and PRC2 in PGC specification. We experimentally validate our predictions using pharmacological blocking of FGFR or its downstream effectors (MEK, PI3K and JAK), and demonstrate enhanced competency for PGC fate in vitro, whilst small molecule inhibition of the enzymatic component of PRC1/PRC2 reveals reduced capacity of cells to form PGCs in vitro. Thus, B-RGPLVMs represent a powerful and flexible data-driven approach for dissecting the temporal dynamics of cell fate decisions, providing unique insights into the mechanisms of early embryogenesis.

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma exhibits profound intratumoral heterogeneity in blood perfusion, which may cause inconsistent therapy response. Particularly, low perfusion may create hypoxic microenvironment and induce resistant clones. Thus, developing validated imaging approaches that define low perfusion compartments is crucial for clinical management.\\n\\nMethodsA total of 112 newly-diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma patients were prospectively recruited for maximal safe resection. Preoperative MRI included anatomical, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and chemical shift imaging (CSI). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were calculated from DTI and DSC respectively. Using thresholding methods, two low perfusion compartments (ADCH-rCBVL and ADCL-rCBVL) were identified. Volumetric analysis was performed. Lactate and macromolecule/lipid levels were determined from multivoxel spectroscopy. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analysed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses.\\n\\nResultsTwo compartments displayed higher lactate and macromolecule/lipid levels than normal controls (each P < 0.001), suggesting hypoxic and pro-inflammatory microenvironment. The proportional volume of ADCL-rCBVL compartment was associated with a larger infiltration area (P < 0.001, rho = 0.42). Lower lactate in this compartment was associated with a less invasive phenotype visualized on DTI. Multivariate Cox regression showed higher lactate level in the ADCL-rCBVL compartment was associated with a worse survival (PFS: HR 2.995, P = 0.047; OS: HR 4.974, P = 0.005).\\n\\nConclusionsThe ADCL-rCBVL compartment represent a treatment resistant sub-region associated with glioblastoma invasiveness. This approach was based on clinically available imaging modalities and could thus provide crucial pretreatment information for clinical decision making.",

Mens responses on the Intrasexual Competitiveness Scale did not appear to track within-subject changes in testosterone.

In preclinical models, PARPi resistance is tied to altered nucleolytic processing (resection) at the 5 ends of a DSB. For example, loss of 53BP1 or Rev7/MAD2L2/FANCV derepresses resection to drive PARPi resistance, although the mechanisms are poorly understood. Long-range resection can be catalyzed by two machineries: the exonuclease Exo1, or the combination of a RecQ helicase and Dna2. Here, we develop a single cell microscopy assay that allows the distinct phases and machineries of resection to be interrogated simultaneously in living S. pombe cells. Using this assay, we find that the 53BP1 orthologue and Rev7 specifically repress long-range resection through the RecQ helicase-dependent pathway, thereby preventing hyper-resection. These results suggest that \\\"rewiring\\\" of BRCA1-deficient cells to employ an Exo1-independent hyper-resection pathway is a driver of PARPi resistance.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria and Archaea represent the base of the evolutionary tree of life and contain the vast majority of phylogenetic and functional diversity. Because these organisms and their traits directly impact ecosystems and human health, a focus on functional traits has become increasingly common in microbial ecology. These trait-based approaches have the potential to link microbial communities and their ecological function. But an open question is how, why, and in what order microorganisms acquired the traits we observe in the present day. To address this, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of microbial traits using genomic data to understand the evolution, selective advantage, and similarity of traits in extant organisms and provide insights into the composition of genomes and communities. We used the geological timeline and physiological expectations to provide independent evidence in support of this evolutionary history. Using this reconstructed evolutionary history, we explored hypotheses related to the composition of genomes. We showed that gene transition rates can be used to make predictions about the size and type of genes in a genome: generalist genomes comprise many evolutionarily labile genes while specialist genomes comprise more highly conserved functional genes. These findings suggest that generalist organisms do not build up and hoard an array of functions, but rather tend to experiment with functions related to environmental sensing, transport, and complex resource degradation. Our results provide a framework for understanding the evolutionary history of extant microorganisms, the origin and maintenanceof traits, and linking evolutionary relatedness and ecological function.",

    "abstract": "Comparing models facilitates testing different hypotheses regarding the computational basis of perception and action. Effective model comparison requires stimuli for which models make different predictions. Typically, experiments use a predetermined set of stimuli or sample stimuli randomly. Both methods have limitations; a predetermined set may not contain stimuli that dissociate the models whereas random sampling may be inefficient. To overcome these limitations, we expanded the psi-algorithm (Kontsevich & Tyler, 1999) from estimating the parameters of a psychometric curve to distinguishing models. To test our algorithm, we applied it to two distinct problems. First, we investigated dissociating sensory noise models. We simulated ideal observers with different noise models performing a 2-afc task. Stimuli were selected randomly or using our algorithm. We found using our algorithm improved the accuracy of model comparison. We also validated the algorithm in subjects by inferring which noise model underlies speed perception. Our algorithm converged quickly to the model previously proposed (Stocker & Simoncelli, 2006), whereas if stimuli were selected randomly model probabilities separated slower and sometimes supported alternative models. Second, we applied our algorithm to a different problem; comparing models of target selection under body acceleration. Previous work found target choice preference is modulated by whole body acceleration (Rincon-Gonzalez et al., 2016). However, the effect is subtle making model comparison difficult. We show that selecting stimuli adaptively could have led to stronger conclusions in model comparison. We conclude that our technique is more efficient and more reliable than current methods of stimulus selection for dissociating models.\\n\\nData AvailabilityAll data and code will be posted on our institutional repository system following acceptance.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in multivariate fMRI analysis stress the importance of information inherent to voxel patterns. Key to interpreting these patterns is estimating the underlying dimensionality of neural representations. Dimensions may correspond to psychological dimensions, such as length and orientation, or involve other coding schemes. Unfortunately, the noise structure of fMRI data inflates dimensionality estimates and thus makes it difficult to assess the true underlying dimensionality of a pattern. To address this challenge, we developed a novel approach to identify brain regions that carry reliable task-modulated signal and to derive an estimate of the signals functional dimensionality. We combined singular value decomposition with cross-validation to find the best low-dimensional projection of a pattern of voxel-responses at a single-subject level. Goodness of the low-dimensional reconstruction is measured as Pearson correlation with a test set, which allows to test for significance of the low-dimensional reconstruction across participants. Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we derive the best estimate and associated uncertainty of underlying dimensionality across participants. We validated our method on simulated data of varying underlying dimensionality, showing that recovered dimensionalities match closely true dimensionalities. We then applied our method to three published fMRI data sets all involving processing of visual stimuli. The results highlight three possible applications of estimating the functional dimensionality of neural data. Firstly, it can aid evaluation of model-based analyses by revealing which areas express reliable, task-modulated signal that could be missed by specific models. Secondly, it can reveal functional differences across brain regions. Thirdly, knowing the functional dimensionality allows assessing task-related differences in the complexity of neural patterns.",

These data represent a new resource for cell biology, revealing gene expression in poorly characterized cell populations and allowing for direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types shared between tissues, such as T-lymphocytes and endothelial cells from distinct anatomical locations. Two distinct technical approaches were used for most tissues: one approach, microfluidic droplet-based 3-end counting, enabled the survey of thousands of cells at relatively low coverage, while the other, FACS-based full length transcript analysis, enabled characterization of cell types with high sensitivity and coverage. The cumulative data provide the foundation for an atlas of transcriptomic cell biology.",

    "abstract": "The Caudal Lateral Epiblast of mammalian embryos harbours bipotent progenitors that contribute to the spinal cord and the paraxial mesoderm in concert with the elongation of the body axis. These progenitors, called Neural Mesodermal Progenitors (NMPs) are identified as cells coexpressing Sox2 and T/Brachyury, a criterion used to derive NMP-like cells from Embryonic Stem Cells in vitro. However, these progenitors do not self renew, as embryonic NMPs do. Here we find that protocols that yield NMP-like cells in vitro first produce a multipotent population that, additional to NMPs, generates progenitors for the lateral plate and intermediate mesoderm. We show that Epiblast Stem Cells (EpiSCs) are an effective source for these multipotent progenitors that are further differentiated by a balance between BMP and Nodal signalling. Importantly, we show that NMP-like cells derived from EpiSCs self renew in vitro and exhibit a gene expression signature similar to that of their embryo counterparts.",

    "abstract": "We present a new method, TrackSig, to estimate the evolutionary trajectories of signatures of different somatic mutational processes from DNA sequencing data from a single, bulk tumour sample. TrackSig uses probability distributions over mutation types, called mutational signatures, to represent different mutational processes and detects the changes in the signature activity using an optimal segmentation algorithm that groups somatic mutations based on their estimated cancer cellular fraction (CCF) and their mutation type (e.g. CAG->CTG). We use two different simulation frameworks to assess both TrackSigs reconstruction accuracy and its robustness to violations of its assumptions, as well as to compare it to a baseline approach. We find 2-4% median error in reconstructing the signature activities on simulations with varying difficulty with one to three subclones at an average depth of 30x. The size and the direction of the activity change is consistent in 83% and 95% of cases respectively. There were an average of 0.02 missed and 0.12 false positive subclones per sample. In our simulations, grouping mutations by mutation type (TrackSig), rather than by clustering CCF (baseline strategy), performs better at estimating signature activities and at identifying subclonal populations in the complex scenarios like branching, CNA gain, violation of infinite site assumption, and the inclusion of neutrally evolving mutations.

Paradoxically, despite a reduction in transduction currents in Ano2-/- ORNs, their spike output for odor stimuli may be higher. We examined the role of Ano2 in ORNs in their native environment in freely breathing mice by imaging activity in ORN axons as they arrive in the olfactory bulb glomeruli. Odor-evoked responses in ORN axons of Ano2-/- mice were consistently larger for a variety of odorants and concentrations. In an open arena, Ano2-/- mice took longer to approach a localized odor source than wild-type mice, revealing clear olfactory behavioral deficits. Our studies provide the first in vivo evidence toward an alternative role for Ano2 in the olfactory transduction cascade, where it may serve as a feedback mechanism to clamp ORN spike output.",

Because there is no simple mapping between the pattern of an objects image on the retina and its physical reflectance, our perception of color and material are made more useful through sophisticated visual computations. A long-standing goal in vision science is to describe how these computations work, particularly as they act to stabilize perceived color and material against variation in scene factors extrinsic to object surface properties, such as the illumination. If we take seriously the notion that perceived color and material are useful because they help guide behavior in natural tasks, then we need experimental that measure and models that describe how they are used in such tasks. To this end, we have developed selection-based methods and accompanying perceptual models for studying perceived object color and material. This focused review highlights key aspects of our work. It includes a discussion of future directions and challenges, as well as an outline of a computational observer model that incorporates early, known, stages of visual processing and that clarifies how early vision shapes selection performance.",

Forests there may have responded to climate change and widespread wildfires ca. 1000 years ago when a previous study indicates >80% of sites on the landscape burned within a century. The fires coincided with regional warming, but the extent of burning declined before the climate cooled again. Potentially, post-fire changes in fuel structure and composition contributed to a decline in burning while the warmth persisted.\\nC_LIO_LIResults of cluster analyses of the pollen percentages indicate that large changes between successive sets of samples coincided with the widespread wildfires at five of the six sites. After the wildfires, sagebrush (Artemisia) and other meadow taxa increased as conifers, especially spruce (Picea), declined across the landscape, indicating that the forests opened.\\nC_LIO_LIThe opening of the forests may have created fuel breaks across the mountain range that limited wildfire after temperatures rose [~]0.5 {degrees}C, and the opening became larger as forests opened further during the Little Ice Age (LIA).

    "abstract": "Many insects use vision to inform their behavior, but visual information differs between habitats and the sensory demands vary with each species ecology. The small size of insects eyes constrains their optical performance, and so it is unsurprising that they have evolved specializations for optimizing the information they obtain from their habitat. Unraveling how behavioral, environmental, and phylogenetic factors influence the evolution of such specializations is difficult, however, because existing techniques to analyze insect eyes require specimens to be preserved beforehand. To facilitate broad comparative studies on insect eyes and the evolution of complex visual behavior, we developed a novel analysis technique that uses x-ray micro-computed tomography to quantify and recreate the visual world of insects. We use our methodology to investigate the eyes of fungus gnats (Orfeliini), a tribe of diminutive Dipterans, to identify the visual specializations they evolved for surviving in different forest habitats and to explore how this changed over 30 million years of evolutionary history. The specimens we studied were preserved in different ways (in ethanol, air dried, and as an endocast in amber), demonstrating that our method provides a new opportunity to quantitatively study and compare the vision of a wide range insects held in museum collections. Our analysis indicates that different visual specializations have evolved between fungus gnat species living in different forest types and that the eyes of gnats from a similar geographic location have evolved to match the changing environmental conditions. Despite the small size of fungus gnats, evolution has evidentially been able to exploit sensory specializations to meet the differing sensory demands of species from a variety of forest habitats.\\n\\nSignificance statementDo insects have visual specializations that evolve with changes in their environment? To answer this question, a novel analysis technique is described that uses 3D imaging and simulations to compare the vision of ancient amber-embedded insects to those of their extant relatives. This study investigated the vision of fungus gnats to understand how tiny insects use vision to negotiate forests, some of the worlds most visually complex environments. Despite being amongst the smallest of any flying insect, the gnats miniature eyes have evolved visual specializations specifically adapted for different forest types, allowing different species to meet their visual demands of their specific habitats.",

    "abstract": "To understand how neural circuits process information, it is essential to identify the relationship between computation and circuit topology. Rich-clubs, highly interconnected sets of neurons, are known to propagate a disproportionate amount of information within cortical circuits. Here, we test the hypothesis that rich-clubs also perform a disproportionate amount of computation. To do so, we recorded the spiking activity of on average [~]300 well-isolated individual neurons from organotypic cortical cultures. We then constructed weighted, directed networks reflecting the effective connectivity between the neurons. For each neuron, we quantified the amount of computation it performed based on its inputs. We found that rich-club neurons compute [~]200% more information than neurons outside of the rich club. Indeed, the amount of computation performed in the rich-club was proportional to the amount information propagation by the same neurons. This suggests that, in these circuits, information propagation drives computation. Comparing the computation-to-propagation ratio inside versus outside of the rich club showed that rich clubs compute at a slightly, though significantly, reduced level ([~]4% lower). In total, our findings indicate that rich club topology in effective cortical circuits supports not only information propagation but also neural computation.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYHere we answer the question of whether rich club topology in functional cortical circuits supports neural computation as it has been previously shown to do for information propagation. To do so, we combined network analysis with information theoretic tools to analyze the spiking activity of hundreds of neurons recorded from organotypic cultures of mouse somatosensory cortex. We found that neurons in rich clubs computed significantly more than neurons outside of rich clubs, suggesting that rich-clubs do support computation in cortical circuits. Indeed, the amount of computation that we found in the rich club was proportional to the amount of information they propagate suggesting that, in these circuits, information propagation drives computation.",

    "abstract": "The alkyne functionality has attracted much interest due to its diverse chemical and biological applications. We recently elucidated an acyl carrier protein (ACP)-dependent alkyne biosynthetic pathway, however, little is known about ACP interactions with the alkyne biosynthetic enzymes, an acyl-ACP ligase (JamA) and a membrane-bound bi-functional desaturase/acetylenase (JamB). Here, we showed that JamB has a more stringent interaction with ACP than JamA. In addition, site directed mutagenesis of a non-cognate ACP significantly improved its compatibility with JamB, suggesting a possible electrostatic interaction at the ACP-JamB interface. Finally, error-prone PCR and screening of a second non-cognate ACP identified hot spots on the ACP that are important for interacting with JamB and yielded mutants which were better recognized by JamB. Our data thus not only provide insights into the ACP interactions in alkyne biosynthesis, but it also potentially aids in future combinatorial biosynthesis of alkyne-tagged metabolites for chemical and biological applications.\\n\\nTopical HeadingBiomolecular Engineering, Bioengineering, Biochemicals, Biofuels, and Food",

    "abstract": "The recent West African Ebola virus pandemic, which affected >28,000 individuals increased interest in anti-Ebolavirus vaccination programs. Here, we systematically analyzed the requirements for a prophylactic vaccination program based on the basic reproductive number (R0, i.e. the number of secondary cases that result from an individual infection). Published R0 values were determined by a systematic literature research and ranged from 0.37 to 20. R0s [&ge;]4 realistically reflected the critical early outbreak phases and superspreading events. Based on the R0, the herd immunity threshold (Ic) was calculated using the equation Ic=1-(1/R0). The critical vaccination coverage (Vc) needed to provide herd immunity was determined by including the vaccine effectiveness (E) using the equation Vc=Ic/E. At an R0 of 4, the Ic is 75% and at an E of 90%, more than 80% of a population need to be vaccinated to establish herd immunity. Such vaccination rates are currently unrealistic because of resistance against vaccinations, financial/ logistical challenges, and a lack of vaccines that provide long-term protection against all human-pathogenic Ebolaviruses. Hence, outbreak management will for the foreseeable future depend on surveillance and case isolation. Clinical vaccine candidates are only available for Ebola viruses. Their use will need to be focused on health care workers, potentially in combination with ring vaccination approaches.",

    "abstract": "Indigenous people usually live in precarious conditions and suffer a disproportionally burden of tuberculosis in Brazil. To characterize the socioeconomic status of indigenous peoples with active tuberculosis in Brazil, this cross-sectional study included all Amerindians that started tuberculosis treatment between March 2011 and December 2012 in four municipalities of Mato Grosso do Sul state (Central-Western region). We tested the approach using principal components analysis (PCA) to create three socioeconomic indexes (SEI) using groups of variables: household characteristics, ownership of durable goods, and both. Cases were then classified into tertiles, with the 1st tertile representing the most disadvantaged. A total of 166 indigenous cases of tuberculosis were included. 31.9% did not have durable goods. 25.9% had family bathroom, 9.0% piped water inside the house and 53.0% electricity, with higher proportions in Miranda and Aquidauana. Houses were predominantly made using natural materials in Amambai and Caarapo. Miranda and Aquidauana had more cases in the 3rd tertile (92.3%) and Amambai, in the 1st tertile (37.7%). The indexes showed similar results and consistency for socioeconomic characterization. The percentage of people in the 3rd tertile increased with years of schooling. The majority in the 3rd tertile received Bolsa Familia, a social welfare programme. This study confirmed the applicability of the PCA using information on household characteristics and ownership of durable goods for socioeconomic characterization of indigenous groups and provided important evidence of the unfavorable living conditions of Amerindians with tuberculosis in Mato Grosso do Sul.",

    "abstract": "Electronic health records and health insurance claims, providing observational data on millions of patients, offer great opportunities, and challenges, for population health studies. The objective of this study is identifying subpopulations that are likely to benefit from a given treatment using observational data. We refer to these subpopulations as \\\"better responders\\\" and focus on characterizing these using linear scores with a limited number of variables. Building upon well-established causal inference techniques for analyzing observational data, we propose two algorithms that generate such scores for identifying better responders, as well as methods for evaluating and comparing these scores. We applied our methodology to a large dataset of ~135,000 epilepsy patients derived from claims data. Out of this sample, 85,000 were used to characterize subpopulations with better response to next-generation (\\\"Newer\\\") anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), compared to an alternative treatment by first-generation (\\\"Older\\\") AEDs. The remaining 50,000 epilepsy patients were then used to evaluate our scores. Our results demonstrate the ability of our scores to identify large subpopulations of epilepsy patients with significantly better response to newer AEDs.",

    "abstract": "Although maternal morbidity and mortality in the U.S. is among the worst of developed countries, pregnant women have been under-represented in research studies, resulting in deficiencies in evidence-based guidance for treatment. There are over two billion smartphone users worldwide, enabling researchers to easily and cheaply conduct extremely large-scale research studies through smartphone apps, especially among pregnant women in whom app use is exceptionally high, predominantly as an information conduit. We developed the first pregnancy research app that is embedded within an existing, popular pregnancy app for self-management and education of expectant mothers. Through the large-scale and simplified collection of survey and sensor generated data via the app, we aim to improve our understanding of factors that promote a healthy pregnancy for both the mother and developing fetus. From the launch of this cohort study on March 16, 2017 through December 17, 2017, we have enrolled 2,058 pregnant women from all 50 states. Our study population is diverse geographically and demographically, and fairly representative of U.S. population averages. We have collected 14,045 individual surveys and 11,669 days of sleep, activity, blood pressure and heart rate measurements during this time. On average, women stayed engaged in the study for 59 days and 45 percent who reached their due date filled out the final outcome survey. During the first nine months, we demonstrated the potential for a smartphone-based research platform to capture an ever-expanding array of longitudinal, objective and subjective participant-generated data from a continuously growing and diverse population of pregnant women.\\n\\nFundingSupported in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences grant UL1TR001114 and a grant from the Qualcomm Foundation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan (NDB) is a comprehensive database of health insurance claims data under Japans National Health Insurance system. The NDB uses two types of personal identification variables (referred to in the database as \\\"ID1\\\" and \\\"ID2\\\") to link the insurance claims of individual patients. However, the information entered against these ID variables is prone to change for several reasons, such as when claimants find or change employment, or due to variations in the spelling of their name. In the present study, we developed a new patient-matching technique that improves upon the existing system of using ID1 and ID2 variables. We also sought to validate a new personal ID variable (ID0) that we propose in order to enhance the efficiency of patient matching in the NDB database.\\n\\nMethodsOur study targeted data from health insurance claims filed between April 2013 and March 2016 for hospitalization, combined diagnostic procedures, outpatient treatment, and dispensing of prescription medication. We developed a new patient-matching algorithm based on the ID1 and ID2 variables, as well as variables for treatment date and clinical outcome. We then attempted to validate our algorithm by comparing the number of patients identified by patient matching with the current ID1 variable and our proposed ID0 variable against the estimated patient population as of 1 October 2015.\\n\\nResultsThe numbers of patients in each sex and age group that were identified with the ID0 variable were lower than those identified using the ID1 variable. By using the ID0 variable, we were able to reduce the number of duplicate records for male and female patients by 5.8% and 6.4%, respectively. The numbers of children, adults older than 75 years, and women of reproductive age identified using the ID1 patient-matching variable were all higher than their corresponding estimates. Conversely, the numbers of these patients identified with the ID0 patient-matching variable were all within their corresponding estimates.\\n\\nConclusionOur findings show that the proposed ID0 variable delivers more precise patient-matching results than the existing ID1 variable. The ID0 variable is currently the best available technique for patient matching in the NDB database. Future patient population estimates should therefore rely on the ID0 variable instead of the ID1 variable.",

Antibody-dependent functions may include neutralization of parasite-host interactions, complement activation, and activation of Fc receptor functions. A role of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by natural killer (NK) cells in protection from malaria has not been established. Here we show that IgG isolated from adults living in a malaria-endemic region activated ADCC by primary human NK cells, which lysed infected red blood cells (RBCs) and inhibited parasite growth in an in vitro assay for ADCC-dependent growth inhibition. RBC lysis by NK cells was highly selective for infected RBCs in a mixed culture with uninfected RBCs. Human antibodies to P. falciparum antigens PfEMP1 and RIFIN were sufficient to promote NK-dependent growth inhibition. As these results implicate acquired immunity through NK-mediated ADCC, antibody-based vaccines that target bloodstream parasites should consider this new mechanism of action.",

Here we combine computational models of vision with semantics, and test the output of the incremental model against patterns of neural oscillations recorded with MEG in humans. Representational Similarity Analysis showed visual information was represented in alpha activity throughout the VVP, and semantic information was represented in theta activity. Furthermore, informational connectivity showed visual information travels through feedforward connections, while visual information is transformed into semantic representations through feedforward and feedback activity, centered on the anterior temporal lobe. Our research highlights that the complex transformations between visual and semantic information is driven by feedforward and recurrent dynamics resulting in object-specific semantics.",

Cellular biology approaches to understand these functional disruptions in HD have primarily focused on cell lines with synthetically long CAG length alleles that clinically represent outliers in this disease and a more severe form of HD that lacks age-onset. Patient-derived fibroblasts are limited to a finite number of passages before succumbing to cellular senescence. We used human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) to immortalize fibroblasts taken from individuals of varying age, sex, disease onset and CAG repeat length, which we have termed TruHD cells. TruHD cells display classic HD phenotypes of altered morphology, size and growth rate, increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, aberrant ADP/ATP ratios and hypophosphorylated huntingtin protein. We additionally observed dysregulated ROS-dependent huntingtin localization to nuclear speckles in HD cells. We report the generation and characterization of a human, clinically relevant cellular model for investigating disease mechanisms in HD at the single cell level, which, unlike transformed cell lines, maintains TP53 function critical for huntingtin transcriptional regulation and genomic integrity.",

    "abstract": "The Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (IAP) family members are well-known endogenous regulators of apoptosis. Whether these proteins regulate other degradation pathways is unclear. Here, we discovered that the IAP member X-linked IAP (XIAP) is crucial for macroautophagy. Loss of XIAP in mouse and human cells inhibited starvation-induced degradation of LC3 proteins and an autophagy substrate p62. It also led to the accumulation of mature autophagosomes, suggesting that XIAP controls autophagic flux by mediating autolysosome formation. Xiap{triangleup}RING/{triangleup}RING cells phenocopy the autophagy defects of Xiap-/- cells, suggesting that the ubiquitinating activity mediated by the catalytic RING domain is critical for autophagic flux. We found that XIAP physically interacts with Syntaxin 17, a regulator of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Syntaxin 17-positive mature autophagosomes positive accumulate in the cytoplasm of starved Xiap-/- cells, suggesting that XIAP might regulate its dissociation from autophagosomes after fusion. XIAP selectively interacts with GABARAP among LC3 family members via the LIR-Docking Site (LDS). Together, our data suggest that XIAP-mediated ubiquitination regulates key autophagy regulators to promote autophagosome-lysosome fusion.",

Reprogramming female mouse somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) leads to X-chromosome reactivation. The extent to which increased X-chromosome dosage (X-dosage) in female iPSCs leads to differences in the molecular and cellular properties of XX and XY iPSCs is still unclear. We show that chromatin accessibility in mouse iPSCs is modulated by X-dosage. Specific sets of transcriptional regulator motifs are enriched in chromatin with increased accessibility in XX or XY iPSCs. We show that the transcriptome, growth and pluripotency exit are also modulated by X-dosage in iPSCs. To understand the mechanisms by which increased X-dosage modulates the molecular and cellular properties of mouse pluripotent stem cells, we used heterozygous deletions of the X-linked gene Dusp9 in XX embryonic stem cells. We show that X-dosage regulates the transcriptome, open chromatin landscape, growth and pluripotency exit largely independently of global DNA methylation. Our results uncover new insights into X-dosage in pluripotent stem cells, providing principles of how gene dosage modulates the epigenetic and genetic mechanisms regulating cell identity.",

To investigate if specific age classes and/or cross-generational signaling affect(s) phenotypic plasticity, we developed a dye-based method to differentiate co-occurring nematode age classes. We applied this method to Pristionchus pacificus, which develops a predatory mouth form to exploit alternative resources and kill competitors in response to high population densities. Remarkably, only adult, but not juvenile, crowding induces the predatory morph in other juveniles. Profiling of secreted metabolites throughout development with HPLC-MS combined with genetic mutants traced this result to the production of adult-specific pheromones. Specifically, the P. pacificus-specific di-ascaroside#1 that induces the predatory morph exhibits a binary induction in adults, even though mouth form is no longer plastic in adults. This cross-generational signaling between adults and juveniles may serve as an indication of rapidly increasing population size. Thus, phenotypic plasticity depends on critical age classes.",

    "abstract": "Fifty years ago, Susumu Ohno proposed that the expression levels of X-linked genes have doubled as dosage compensation for autosomal genes due to degeneration of Y-linked homologs during evolution of mammalian sex chromosomes. Recent studies have nevertheless shown that the X to autosome expression ratio equals ~1 in haploid human parthenogenetic embryonic stem (pES) cells and ~0.5 in diploid pES cells, thus refuting Ohnos hypothesis. Here, by reanalyzing a RNA-seq-based single-cell transcriptome dataset of human embryos (Petropoulos, et al. 2016), we found that from the 8-cell stage until the time-point just prior to implantation, the expression levels of X-linked genes are not two-fold upregulated in male cells and gradually decrease from two-fold in female cells. This observation suggests that the expression levels of X-linked genes are imbalanced, with autosomal genes starting from the early 8-cell stage, and that the dosage conversion is fast, such that the X:AA expression ratio reaches ~0.5 in no more than a week. Additional analyses of gene expression noise further suggest that the dosage sensitivity of X-linked genes is weaker than that of autosomal genes in differentiated female cells, which contradicts a key assumption of Ohnos hypothesis. Moreover, the dosage-sensitive housekeeping genes are preferentially located on autosomes, implying selection against X-linkage for dosage-sensitive genes. Our results collectively suggest an alternative to Ohnos hypothesis that X-linked genes are less likely to be dosage sensitive than autosomal genes.",

Twenty-two non-selected variables as well as selected ones by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression analysis and by stepwise logistic regression analysis were input into the constructed multilayer artificial neural network (ANN) programs. 232 patients were used as training cases of ANN programs, and the remaining 102 patients were for the test to output the probability of prostate cancer existence, accuracy of prostate cancer prediction, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with the learned model.\\n\\nResultsWith any prostate cancer objective variable, Lasso and stepwise regression analyses selected 12 and 9 explanatory variables from 22, respectively. In common between them, age at biopsy, findings on digital rectal examination, findings in the peripheral zone on MRI diffusion-weighted imaging, and body mass index were positively influential variables, while numbers of previous prostatic biopsy and prostate volume were negatively influential. Using trained ANNs with multiple hidden layers, the accuracy of predicting any prostate cancer in test samples was about 5-10% higher compared with that with logistic regression analysis (LR). The AUCs with multilayer ANN were significantly larger on inputting variables that were selected by the stepwise logistic regression compared with the AUC with LR. The ANN had a higher net-benefit than LR between prostate cancer probability cut-off values of 0.38 and 0.6.\\n\\nConclusionANN accurately predicted prostate cancer without biopsy marginally better than LR.

    "abstract": "Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to a ubiquity of molecular sequence data. This data avalanche is particularly challenging in metagenetics, which focuses on taxonomic identification of sequences obtained from diverse microbial environments. To achieve this, phylogenetic placement methods determine how these sequences fit into an evolutionary context. Previous implementations of phylogenetic placement algorithms, such as the Evolutionary Placement Algorithm (EPA) included in RAxML, or O_SCPLOWPPLACERC_SCPLOW, are being increasingly used for this purpose. However, due to the steady progress in NGS technologies, the current implementations face substantial scalability limitations. Here we present EPA-O_SCPLOWNGC_SCPLOW, a complete reimplementation of the EPA that is substantially faster, offers a distributed memory parallelization, and integrates concepts from both, RAxML-EPA, and O_SCPLOWPPLACERC_SCPLOW. EPA-O_SCPLOWNGC_SCPLOW can be executed on standard shared memory, as well as on distributed memory systems (e.g., computing clusters). To demonstrate the scalability of EPA-O_SCPLOWNGC_SCPLOW we placed 1 billion metagenetic reads from the Tara Oceans Project onto a reference tree with 3,748 taxa in just under 7 hours, using 2,048 cores. Our performance assessment shows that EPA-O_SCPLOWNGC_SCPLOW outperforms RAxML-EPA and O_SCPLOWPPLACERC_SCPLOW by up to a factor of 30 in sequential execution mode, while attaining comparable parallel efficiency on shared memory systems. We further show that the distributed memory parallelization of EPA-O_SCPLOWNGC_SCPLOW scales well up to 3,520 cores.

The central dogma of microtubules is that all their functions are driven by dynamic instability; understanding its key phenomena (i.e. catastrophe, rescue, pause, differential behaviors at the plus and minus ends) distilled from a myriad of experiments under a consistent and unified scheme, however, has been unattainable. Here, we present a novel statistical-physics-based model uniquely constructed from conformational states deduced from existing tubulin structures, with transitions between them controlled by steric constraints and mechanical energy of the microtubule lattice. This mechano-chemical model allows, for the first time, all the key phenomena of dynamic instability to be coherently reproduced by the corresponding kinetic simulations. Long-puzzling phenomena, such as aging, small GTP-cap size, fast catastrophe upon dilution and temperature-induced ribbon-to-tube transition of GMPCPP-tubulins, robustly emerge and thus can be understood with confidence.",

However, whole-genome resequencing of many conspecific individuals remains cost-prohibitive for most species. This is especially true for species with very large genomes with extensive genomic redundancy, such as the genomes of coniferous trees. The genome assembly for the conifer Norway spruce (Picea abies) was the first published draft genome assembly for any gymnosperm. Our goal was to develop a dense set of genome-wide SNP markers for Norway spruce to be used for assembly improvement and population studies. From 80,000 initial probe candidates, we developed two partially-overlapping sets of sequence capture probes: one developed against 56 haploid megagametophytes, to aid assembly improvement; and the other developed against 6 diploid needle samples, to aid population studies. We focused probe development within genes, as delineated via the annotation of ~67,000 gene models accompanying P. abies assembly version 1.0. The 31,277 probes developed against megagametophytes covered 19,268 gene models (mean 1.62 probes/model). The 40,018 probes developed against diploid tissue covered 26,219 gene modules (mean 1.53 probes/model). Analysis of read coverage and variant quality around probe sites showed that initial alignment of captured reads should be done against the whole genome sequence, rather than a subset of probe-containing scaffolds, to overcome occasional capture of sequences outside of designed regions. All three probe sets, anchored to the P. abies 1.0 genome assembly and annotation, are available for download.",

    "abstract": "The human inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) is a ventral, temporo-occipital association tract. Though described in early neuroanatomical works, its existence was later questioned. Application of in vivo tractography to the neuroanatomical study of the ILF has generally confirmed its existence, however consensus is lacking regarding its subdivision, laterality and connectivity. Further, there is a paucity of detailed neuroanatomic data pertaining to the exact anatomy of the ILF. Generalized Q-Sampling imaging (GQI) is a non-tensor tractographic modality permitting high resolution imaging of white-matter structures. As it is a non-tensor modality, it permits visualization of crossing fibers and accurate delineation of close-proximity fiber-systems. We applied deterministic GQI tractography to data from 30 healthy subjects and a large-volume diffusion atlas, to delineate ILF anatomy. Post-mortem white matter dissection was also carried out in a cadaveric specimen for further validation. The ILF was found in all 60 hemispheres. At its occipital extremity, it demonstrated a trifurcated termination pattern which was used to separate the ILF into 3 distinct sub-fascicles: Dorsolateral, ventrolateral and ventromedial. These divisions were consistent across the subject set and within the atlas. We applied quantitative techniques to study connectivity strength of the ILF at its anterior and posterior extremities. Overall, the 3 sub-fascicles, and the whole ILF, demonstrated strong leftward-lateralized connectivity patterns. Leftward-lateralization was also found for ILF volumes across the subject set. Due to connective and volumetric leftward-dominance and ventral location, we postulate the ILFs role in the semantic system. Further, our results are in agreement with functional and lesion-based postulations pertaining to the ILFs role in facial recognition.",

    "abstract": "While many non-human animals show basic exploratory behaviors, it remains unclear whether any animals possess human-like curiosity. We propose that human-like curiosity satisfies three formal criteria: (1) willingness to pay (or to sacrifice reward) to obtain information, (2) that the information provides no instrumental or strategic benefit (and the subject understands this), and (3) the amount the subject is willing to pay scales with the amount of information available. Although previous work, including our own, demonstrates that some animals will sacrifice juice rewards for information, that information normally predicts upcoming rewards and their ostensible curiosity may therefore be a byproduct of reinforcement processes. Here we get around this potential confound by showing that macaques sacrifice juice to obtain information about counterfactual outcomes (outcomes that could have occurred had the subject chosen differently). Moreover, willingness-to-pay scales with the information (Shannon entropy) offered by the counterfactual option. These results demonstrate human-like curiosity in non-human animals according to our strict criteria, which circumvent several confounds associated with less stringent criteria.",

    "abstract": "MotivationA common class of behaviour encountered in the biological sciences involves branching and recombination. During branching, a statistical process bifurcates resulting in two or more potentially correlated processes that may under-go further branching; the contrary is true during recombination, where two or more statistical processes converge into one. A key objective is to identify the time of this bifurcation (branch time) from time series measurements e.g., comparing a control time series with a perturbed time series. Whilst statistical treatments for the two branch (control versus treatment) case exists, the ability to infer more complex branching structure from time series data remains open. Gaussian processes (GPs) represents an ideal framework for such analysis, allowing for nonlinear regression that includes a rigorous treatment of uncertainty. Currently, however, GP models only exist for two-branch systems. Here we highlight how arbitrarily complex branching processes can be built using the correct composition of covariance functions within a GP framework, thus outlining a general framework for the treatment of branching and recombination in the form of branch-recombinant Gaussian processes (B-RGPs). We first demonstrate the performance of B-RGPs compared to a variety of existing regression approaches, and demonstrate robustness to model misspecification. B-RGPs are then used to investigate the branching patterns of Arabidopsis thaliana gene expression following inoculation with the hemibotrophic bacteria, Pseudomonas syringae DC3000, and a disarmed mutant strain, hrpA. By grouping genes according to the number of branches, we could naturally separate out genes involved in basal immune response from those subverted by the virulent strain, and show enrichment for targets of pathogen protein effectors. Finally, we identify two early branching genes WRKY11 and WRKY17, and showed that groups of genes that branched at similar times to WRKY11/17 were enriched for W-box binding motifs, and overrepresented for genes differentially expressed in WRKY11/17 knockouts, suggesting that branch time could be used for identifying direct and indirect binding targets of key transcription factors.

    "abstract": "Manipulation of natural mosquito populations using the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia is being investigated as a novel strategy to reduce the burden of mosquito-borne viruses. To evaluate the efficacy of these interventions, it will be critical to determine Wolbachia infection frequencies in Aedes aegypti mosquito populations. However, current diagnostic tools are not well-suited to fit this need. Morphological methods cannot identify Wolbachia, immunoassays often suffer from low sensitivity and poor throughput, while PCR and spectroscopy require complex instruments and technical expertise, which restrict their use to centralized laboratories. To address this unmet need, we have used loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes to create a one-pot sample-to-answer nucleic acid diagnostic platform for vector and symbiont surveillance. LAMP-OSD assays can directly amplify target nucleic acids from macerated mosquitoes without requiring nucleic acid purification and yield specific single endpoint yes/no fluorescence signals that are observable to eye or by cellphone camera. We demonstrate cellphone-imaged LAMP-OSD tests for two targets, the Aedes aegypti cytochrome oxidase I (coi) gene and the Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) gene, and show a limit of detection of 4 and 40 target DNA copies, respectively. In a blinded test of 90 field-caught mosquitoes, the coi LAMP-OSD assay demonstrated 98% specificity and 97% sensitivity in identifying Ae. aegypti mosquitoes even after 3 weeks of storage without desiccant at 37 {degrees}C. Similarly, the wsp LAMP-OSD assay readily identified the wAlbB Wolbachia strain in field-collected Aedes albopictus mosquitoes without generating any false positive signals. Modest technology requirements, minimal execution steps, simple binary readout, and robust accuracy make the LAMP-OSD-to-cellphone assay platform well suited for field vector surveillance in austere or resource-limited conditions.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMosquitoes spread many human pathogens and novel approaches are required to reduce the burden of mosquito-borne disease. One promising approach is transferring Wolbachia into Aedes aegypti mosquitoes where it blocks transmission of arboviruses like dengue, Zika and Yellow fever viruses and spreads through mosquito populations. For effective evaluation of this approach, regular surveillance of Wolbachia infections in Ae. aegypti is required, but current diagnostic tools are not well suited to support these critical surveillance needs. To fill this need we developed a simple, robust and inexpensive assay to identify Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and Wolbachia using our unique one-pot assay platform, LAMP-OSD, which uses loop-mediated isothermal amplification to amplify nucleic acid targets at a single temperature. Unlike other LAMP-based tests, our assays assure accuracy by coupling amplification with novel nucleic acid strand displacement (OSD) probes that hybridize to specific sequences in LAMP amplification products and thereby generate simple yes/no readout of fluorescence readable by human eye and by off-the-shelf cellphones. To facilitate field use, we developed our assays so they are compatible with crushed mosquito homogenate as the template, meaning no nucleic acid extraction is required. In blinded tests using field collected mosquitoes, LAMP-OSD-cellphone tests performed robustly to identify 29 of 30 Ae. aegypti even after 3 weeks of storage at 37 {degrees}C while producing only one false positive out of 60 non-specific mosquitoes. Similarly, our assay could identify Wolbachia in field-caught Aedes albopictus without producing any false positives. Our easy to use and easy to interpret assays should facilitate widespread field mosquito surveillance with minimal instrumentation and high accuracy.",

Proteins with a predicted ribonuclease (RNase)-like fold (termed RALPHs) comprise the largest set of secreted effector candidates within the B. graminis f. sp. hordei genome. Their exceptional abundance suggests they play crucial functions during pathogenesis. We show that transgenic expression of RALPH CSEP0064/BEC1054 increases susceptibility to infection in monocotyledenous and dicotyledonous plants. CSEP0064/BEC1054 interacts in planta with five host proteins: two translation elongation factors (eEF1 and eEF1{gamma}), two pathogenesis-related proteins (PR5 and PR10) and a glutathione-S-transferase. We present the first crystal structure of a RALPH, CSEP0064/BEC1054, demonstrating it has an RNase-like fold. The protein interacts with total RNA and weakly with DNA. Methyl jasmonate levels modulate susceptibility to aniline-induced host RNA fragmentation. In planta expression of CSEP0064/BEC1054 reduces the formation of this RNA fragment. We propose that CSEP0064/BEC1054 is a pseudoenzyme that binds to host ribosomes, thereby inhibiting the action of plant ribosome-inactivating proteins that would otherwise lead to host cell death, an unviable interaction and demise of the fungus.",

This \\\"routine\\\" technique contributes to the progress of scientific projects across many fields by revealing structural details and molecular localization, but researchers need to be aware that detection efficiency and emission light path performance is of major influence in the confocal image quality. By design, a large portion of the signal is discarded in confocal imaging, leading to a decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which in turn limits resolution. A well-aligned system and high performance detectors are needed in order to generate an image of best quality. However, a convenient method to address system status and performance on the emission side is still lacking. Here, we present a complete method to assess microscope and emission light path performance in terms of SNR, with a comprehensive protocol alongside NoiSee, an easy-to-use macro for Fiji (available via the corresponding update site). We used this method to compare several confocal systems in our facility on biological samples under typical imaging conditions. Our method reveals differences in microscope performance and highlights the various detector types used (multialkali photomultiplier tube (PMT), gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) PMT, and Hybrid detector). Altogether, our method will provide useful information to research groups and facilities to diagnose their confocal microscopes.",

Fission yeast NDR/LATS kinase Orb6 has been proposed to control cell polarity via spatial regulation of Gef1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Cdc42. Here we show that Orb6 plays a critical role as a positive regulator of exocytosis, independent of Gef1. Through Orb6 inhibition in vivo and quantitative global phosphoproteomics, we identify several proteins involved in membrane trafficking as Orb6 targets, and we confirm Sec3 and Sec5, conserved components of the exocyst complex, as substrates of Orb6 both in vivo and in vitro. Our results suggest that Orb6 kinase activity is crucial for exocyst localization to actively-growing cell tips and for exocyst activity during septum dissolution after cytokinesis. We further show that Orb6 phosphorylation of Sec3 serine-201 contributes to exocyst function in parallel with exocyst protein Exo70. We propose that Orb6 contributes to polarized growth by regulating membrane trafficking at multiple levels.",

    "abstract": "Inbreeding increases the risk of certain Mendelian disorders in humans but may also reduce fitness through its effects on complex traits and diseases. Such inbreeding depression is thought to occur due to increased homozygosity at causal variants that are recessive with respect to fitness. Until recently it has been difficult to amass large enough sample sizes to investigate the effects of inbreeding depression on complex traits using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in population-based samples. Further, it is difficult to infer causation in analyses that relate degree of inbreeding to complex traits because confounding variables (e.g., education) may influence both the likelihood for parents to outbreed and offspring trait values. The present study used runs of homozygosity in genome-wide SNP data in up to 400,000 individuals in the UK Biobank to estimate the proportion of the autosome that exists in autozygous tracts--stretches of the genome which are identical due to a shared common ancestor. After multiple testing corrections and controlling for possible sociodemographic confounders, we found significant relationships in the predicted direction between estimated autozygosity and three of the 26 traits we investigated: age at first sexual intercourse, fluid intelligence, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Our findings for fluid intelligence and forced expiratory volume corroborate those of several published studies while the finding for age at first sexual intercourse was novel. These results may suggest that these traits have been associated with Darwinian fitness over evolutionary time, although there are other possible explanations for these associations that cannot be eliminated. Some of the autozygosity-trait relationships were attenuated after controlling for background sociodemographic characteristics, suggesting that care needs to be taken in the design and interpretation of ROH studies in order to glean reliable information about the genetic architecture and evolutionary history of complex traits.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryInbreeding is well known to increase the risk of rare, monogenic diseases, and there has been some evidence that it also affects complex traits, such as cognition and educational attainment. However, difficulties can arise when inferring causation in these types of analyses because of the potential for confounding variables (e.g., socioeconomic status) to bias the observed relationships between distant inbreeding and complex traits. In this investigation, we used single-nucleotide polymorphism data in a very large (N > 400,000) sample of seemingly outbred individuals to quantify the degree to which distant inbreeding is associated with 26 complex traits. We found robust evidence that distant inbreeding is inversely associated with fluid intelligence and a measure of lung function, and is positively associated with age at first sex, while other trait associations with inbreeding were attenuated after controlling for background sociodemographic characteristics. Our findings are consistent with evolutionary predictions that fluid intelligence, lung function, and age at first sex have been under selection pressures over time; however, they also suggest that confounding variables must be accounted for in order to reliably interpret results from these types of analyses.",

At the same time, identification of somatic insertions presented in small proportion of cells, such as neurons, remains a considerable challenge.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we developed a normalization procedure for library enrichment by DNA sequences corresponding to rare somatic RE insertions. Two rounds of normalization increased the number of fragments adjacent to somatic REs in the sequenced sample by more than 26-fold, and the number of identified somatic REs was increased by 7.9-fold.\\n\\nConclusionsThe developed technique can be used in combination with vast majority of modern RE identification approaches and can dramatically increase their capacity to detect rare somatic RE insertions in different types of cells.",

In electron micrograms of neurites, two types of vesicles can be distinguished by morphological criteria, the classical \\\"clear core\\\" vesicles (CCV) and the typically larger \\\"dense core\\\" vesicles (DCV), with differences in electron density due to their diverse cargos. Compared to CCVs, the precise function of DCVs is less defined. DCVs are known to store neuropeptides, which function as neuronal messengers and modulators [1]. In C. elegans, they play a role in locomotion, dauer formation, egg-laying, and mechano- and chemosensation [2]. Another type of DCVs, also referred to as granulated vesicles, are known to transport Bassoon, Piccolo and further constituents of the presynaptic density in the center of the active zone (AZ), and therefore are important for synaptogenesis [3].\\n\\nTo better understand the role of different types of SVs, we present here a new automated approach to classify vesicles. We combine machine learning with an extension of our previously developed vesicle segmentation workflow, the ImageJ macro 3D ART VeSElecT. With that we reliably distinguish CCVs and DCVs in electron tomograms of C. elegans NMJs using image-based features. Analysis of the underlying ground truth data shows an increased fraction of DCVs as well as a higher mean distance between DCVs and AZs in dauer larvae compared to young adult hermaphrodites. Our machine learning based tools are adaptable and can be applied to study properties of different synaptic vesicle pools in electron tomograms of diverse model organisms.\\n\\n2.

    "abstract": "Microbial communities have adapted to greatly variable environments in order to survive both short-term perturbations and permanent changes. The diauxic shift of Escherichia coli, growing first on glucose and, after it is exhausted, on acetate, is still today actively studied. As a fundamental example of metabolic adaptation, we are interested in understanding if diauxie in monocultures of E. coli is a coordinated and uniform metabolic shift, or rather the observable emergent result of individual sub-populations behavior. To do so we first develop a modeling framework that integrates dynamic models (ordinary differential equation systems) with structural models (metabolic networks), providing an open source modeling framework that is suitable to investigate the dynamics of microbial communities. We apply our methods to model E. coli either as having an average, unique metabolic state or as being the combination of two E. coli populations adapted to one of the two carbon sources. Our results are in strong agreement with previously published data and suggest that rather than a coordinated metabolic shift, diauxie could be the emergent pattern resulting from a survival strategy where individual cells differentiate for optimal growth on different substrates in view of environmental fluctuations. This work offers a new perspective on how to use dynamic metabolic modeling to investigate population dynamics, as the proposed approach can be easily transfered to studies on other multi-species communities as well as single cells.\\n\\nImportanceEscherichia coli diauxie is a fundamental example of metabolic adaptation that has not yet been completely understood, and to this aim approaches integrating experimental and theoretical biology are needed. We present a novel dynamic metabolic modeling approach that captures diauxie as an emergent property of sub-population dynamics rather than a homogeneous metabolic shift in E. coli monocultures. Without fine tuning of the parameters of E. coli core genome-scale model we obtain good agreement with published data. Our results suggest a change of paradigm in using single organism metabolic models, which can only to a certain approximation represent the average population metabolic state. We finally provide an open source modeling framework that can be applied to model multi-organism dynamics in variable environments.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying bipolar disorder (BPD) have remained largely unknown. Postmortem brain tissue studies comparing BPD patients with healthy controls have produced a heterogeneous array of potentially implicated protein-coding RNAs. We hypothesized that dysregulation of not only coding, but multiple classes of RNA (coding RNA, long non-coding (lnc) RNA, circular (circ) RNA, and/or alternative splicing) underlie the pathogenesis of BPD. Using non-polyadenylated libraries we performed RNA sequencing in postmortem human medial frontal gyrus tissue from BPD patients and healthy controls. We found twenty genes, some of which not previously implicated in BPD, differentially expressed. PCR validation and replication confirmed the implication of these DE genes. Functional analyses identified enrichment of angiogenesis, vascular system development and histone H3-K4 demethylation. In addition, ten lncRNA transcripts were differentially expressed. Furthermore, we detected an overall increased number of alternative splicing events in BPD, as well as an increase in the number of genes carrying alternative splicing events. Finally, we report altered levels of two circular transcripts, cNEBL and cEPHA3. In conclusion, our non-coding RNA findings demonstrate that RNA dysregulation in BPD is not limited to coding regions, opening avenues for future pharmacological investigations and biomarker research.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALEDespite improved diagnostics, pulmonary pathogens in immunocompromised children frequently evade detection, leading to significant morbidity and mortality.\\n\\nOBJECTIVESTo develop a highly sensitive metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) assay capable of evaluating the pulmonary microbiome and identifying diverse pathogens in the lungs of immunocompromised children.\\n\\nMETHODSWe collected 41 lower respiratory specimens from 34 immunocompromised children undergoing evaluation for pulmonary disease at 3 childrens hospitals from 2014-2016. Samples underwent mechanical homogenization, paired RNA/DNA extraction, and metagenomic sequencing. Sequencing reads were aligned to the NCBI nucleotide reference database to determine taxonomic identities. Statistical outliers were determined based on abundance within each sample and relative to other samples in the cohort.\\n\\nMEASUREMENTS & MAIN RESULTSWe identified a rich cross-domain pulmonary microbiome containing bacteria, fungi, RNA viruses, and DNA viruses in each patient. Potentially pathogenic bacteria were ubiquitous among samples but could be distinguished as possible causes of disease by parsing for outlier organisms. Samples with bacterial outliers had significantly depressed alpha-diversity (median 0.58, IQR 0.33-0.62 vs. median 0.94, IQR 0.93-0.95, p<0.001). Potential pathogens were detected in half of samples previously negative by clinical diagnostics, demonstrating increased sensitivity for missed pulmonary pathogens (p<0.001).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSAn optimized mNGS assay for pulmonary microbes demonstrates significant inoculation of the lower airways of immunocompromised children with diverse bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Potential pathogens can be identified based on absolute and relative abundance. Ongoing investigation is needed to determine the pathogenic significance of outlier microbes in the lungs of immunocompromised children with pulmonary disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt is currently present in the literature that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) defects are associated with a great number of diseases including cancers. The role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variations in the development of thyroid cancer is a highly controversial topic. In this study, we investigated the role of mt-DNA control region (CR) variations in thyroid tumor progression and the influence of mtDNA haplogroups on susceptibility to thyroid tumors.\\n\\nMaterial & methodFor this purpose, totally 108 hot thyroid nodules (HTNs), 95 cold thyroid nodules (CTNs), 48 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) samples with their surrounding tissues and 104 healthy control subjects blood samples were screened for entire mtDNA CR variations by using Sanger sequencing. The obtained DNA sequences were anaysed with the mistomaster, a web-based bioinformatics tool.\\n\\nResultsMtDNA haplogroup U was significantly associated with susceptibility to benign and malign thyroid entities on the other hand J haplogroup was associated with a protective role for benign thyroid nodules. Besides, 8 SNPs (T146C, G185A, C194T, C295T, G16129A, T16304C, A16343G and T16362C) in mtDNA CR region were associated with the occurrence of benign and malign thyroid nodules in Turkish population. By contrast with the healthy Turkish population and HTNs, frequency of C7 repeats in D310 polycytosine sequence was found higher in cold thyroid nodules and PTC samples. Beside this, the frequency of somatic mutations in mtMSI regions including T16189C and D514 CA dinucleotide repeats were found higher in PTC samples than the benign thyroid nodules. Conversely, the frequency of somatic mutations in D310 was detected higher in HTNs than CTNs and PTCs.\\n\\nConclusionmtDNA D310 instability do not play a role in tumorogenesis of the PTC but the results indicates that it might be used as a diagnostic clonal expansion biomarker for premalignant thyroid tumor cells. Beside this, D514 CA instability might be used as prognostic biomarker in PTCs. Also, we showed that somatic mutation rate is less frequent in more aggressive tumors when we examined micro- and macro carcinomas as well as BRAFV600E mutation.",

    "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein Fat-Induced Transcript 2 (FIT2) has emerged as a key factor in lipid droplet (LD) formation, although its molecular function is unknown. Highlighting its importance, FIT2 orthologs are essential in worms and mice, and FIT2 deficiency causes a deafness/dystonia syndrome in humans. Here we show that FIT2 is a lipid phosphate phosphatase (LPP) enzyme that is required for maintaining the normal structure of the ER. Recombinant FIT2 exhibits LPP activity in vitro and loss of this activity in cells leads to ER membrane morphological changes and ER stress. Defects in LD formation in FIT2 depletion appear to be secondary to membrane lipid abnormalities, possibly due to alterations in phospholipids required for coating forming LDs. Our findings uncover an enzymatic role for FIT2 in ER lipid metabolism that is crucial for ER membrane homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Prion diseases, Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease (PD) are fatal degenerative disorders that share common neuropathological and biochemical features, including the aggregation of pathological protein conformers. Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (Lag3, also known as CD223) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of receptors expressed on peripheral immune cells, microglia and neurons, which serves as a receptor for -synuclein aggregates in PD. Here we examined the possible role of Lag3 in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. Through quantitative real-time PCR and RNA-sequencing, we found that the expression levels of Lag3 were relatively low in the adult mouse brains, yet its expression was increased after prion infection. However, we failed finding significant differences regarding the incubation time, PrPSc load, neurodegeneration, astrocyte and microglia reactions and inflammatory gene expression between the Lag3 knockout mice and wild-type littermate controls after prion infection. We conclude that loss of Lag3 has no significant influence on prion disease pathogenesis. Considering that Lag3 is an immune checkpoint receptor, our results suggest that immune checkpoint inhibition (an increasingly prevalent therapeutic modality against many types of cancer) might not exert positive or negative effects on the progression of prion diseases.",
