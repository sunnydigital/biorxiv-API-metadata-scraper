    "abstract": "The oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains live-attenuated polioviruses that induce immunity by causing low virulence infections in vaccine recipients and their close contacts. Widespread immunization with OPV has reduced the annual global burden of paralytic poliomyelitis by a factor of ten thousand or more and has driven wild poliovirus (WPV) to the brink of eradication. However, in instances that have so far been rare, OPV can paralyze vaccine recipients and generate vaccine-derived polio outbreaks. To complete polio eradication, OPV use should eventually cease, but doing so will leave a growing population fully susceptible to infection. If poliovirus is reintroduced after OPV cessation, under what conditions will OPV vaccination be required to interrupt transmission? Can conditions exist where OPV and WPV reintroduction present similar risks of transmission? To answer these questions, we built a multiscale mathematical model of infection and transmission calibrated to data from clinical trials and field epidemiology studies. At the within-host level, the model describes the effects of vaccination and waning immunity on shedding and oral susceptibility to infection. At the between-host level, the model emulates the interaction of shedding and oral susceptibility with sanitation and person-to-person contact patterns to determine the transmission rate in communities. Our results show that inactivated polio vaccine is sufficient to prevent outbreaks in low transmission rate settings, and that OPV can be reintroduced and withdrawn as needed in moderate transmission rate settings. However, in high transmission rate settings, the conditions that support vaccine-derived outbreaks have only been rare because population immunity has been high. Absent population immunity, the Sabin strains from OPV will be nearly as capable of causing outbreaks as WPV. If post-cessation outbreak responses are followed by new vaccine-derived outbreaks, strategies to restore population immunity will be required to ensure the stability of polio eradication.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryOral polio vaccine (OPV) has played an essential role in the elimination of wild poliovirus (WPV). OPV contains attenuated yet transmissible viruses that can spread from person-to-person. When OPV transmission persists uninterrupted, vaccine-derived outbreaks occur. After OPV is no longer used in routine immunization, as with the cessation of type 2 OPV in 2016, population immunity will decline. A key question is how this affects the potential of OPV viruses to spread within and across communities. To address this, we examined the roles of immunity, sanitation, and social contact in limiting OPV transmission. Our results derive from an extensive review and synthesis of vaccine trial data and community epidemiological studies. Shedding, oral susceptibility to infection, and transmission data are analyzed to systematically explain and model observations of WPV and OPV circulation. We show that in high transmission rate settings, falling population immunity after OPV cessation will lead to conditions where OPV and WPV are similarly capable of causing outbreaks, and that this conclusion is compatible with the known safety of OPV prior to global cessation. Novel strategies will be required to ensure the stability of polio eradication for all time.",

    "abstract": "The ability of organisms to adaptively respond to environmental changes (evolvability) is usually considered to be an important advantage in interspecific competition. It has been suggested, however, that evolvability could be a double-edged sword that could present a serious handicap in fluctuating environments. The authors of this counterintuitive idea have published only verbal models to support their claims.\\n\\nHere we present the results of individual-based stochastic modelling of competition between two asexual species differing only by their evolvability. They show that, in changeable environments, less evolvable species could outperform their more evolvable competitors in a broad area of a parameter space, regardless of whether the conditions fluctuated periodically or aperiodically. Highly evolvable species prospered better nearly all the time; however, they sustained a higher probability of extinction during rare events of the rapid transient change of conditions.\\n\\nOur results offer an explanation of why sexually reproducing species, with their reduced capacity to respond adaptively to local or temporal environmental changes, prevail in most eukaryotic taxa in nearly all biotopes on the surface of Earth. These species may suffer several important disadvantages in direct competitive battles with asexual species; however, they might win in changeable environments in the more important sorting-according-to-stability war.",

However, no study of successfully applied genome editing has been reported in a dinoflagellate despite the first genetic transformation of Symbiodinium being published about 20 years ago. Using an array of different available transformation techniques, we attempted to transform Symbiodinium microadriaticum (CCMP2467), a dinoflagellate symbiont of reef-building corals, with the view to performing subsequent CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing. Plasmid vectors designed for nuclear transformation containing the chloramphenicol resistance gene under the control of the CaMV p35S promoter as well as several putative endogenous promoters were used to test a variety of transformation techniques including biolistics, electroporation and silicon carbide whiskers. Chloroplast-targeted transformation were attempted using an engineered Symbiodinium chloroplast minicircle encoding a modified PsbA protein that confers atrazine resistance. We report that we have been unable to confer chloramphenicol or atrazine resistance to Symbiodinium microadriaticum strain CCMP2467.",

    "abstract": "Identification of intron boundaries, called splice junctions, is an important part of delineating gene structure and functions. This also provides valuable in-sights into the role of alternative splicing in increasing functional diversity of genes. Identification of splice junctions through RNA-seq is by mapping short reads to the reference genome which is prone to errors due to random sequence matches. This encourages identification of splicing junctions through computa-tional methods based on machine learning. Existing models are dependent on feature extraction and selection for capturing splicing signals lying in vicinity of splice junctions. But such manually extracted features are not exhaustive. We introduce distributed feature representation, SpliceVec, to avoid explicit and biased feature extraction generally adopted for such tasks. SpliceVec is based on two widely used distributed representation models in natural language processing. Learned feature representation in form of SpliceVec is fed to multi-layer perceptron for splice junction classification task. An intrinsic evaluation of SpliceVec indicates that it is able to group true and false sites distinctly. Our study on optimal context to be considered for feature extraction indicates inclusion of entire intronic sequence to be better than flanking upstream and downstream region around splice junctions. Further, SpliceVec is invariant to canonical and non-canonical splice junction detection. The proposed model is consistent in its performance even with reduced dataset and class-imbalanced dataset. SpliceVec is computationally efficient and can be trained with user defined data as well.",

To characterize planetary-scale biochemistry, we constructed biochemical networks using a global database of 28,146 annotated genomes and metagenomes, and 8,658 cataloged biochemical reactions. We uncover scaling laws governing biochemical diversity and network structure shared across levels of organization from individuals to ecosystems, to the biosphere as a whole. Comparing real biochemical networks to random chemical networks reveals the observed biological scaling is not solely a product of the biochemistry shared across life on Earth. Instead, it emerges due to how the global inventory of biochemical reactions is partitioned into individuals. We show the three domains of life are topologically distinguishable, with > 80% accuracy in predicting evolutionary domain based on biochemical network size and average topology. Taken together our results point to a deeper level of organization in biochemical networks than what has been understood so far.",

    "abstract": "Virus attenuation by genome re-encoding is a pioneering approach for generating effective live-attenuated vaccine candidates. Its core principle is to introduce a large number of synonymous substitutions into the viral genome to produce stable attenuation of the targeted virus. Introduction of large numbers of mutations has also been shown to maintain stability of the attenuated phenotype by lowering the risk of reversion and recombination of re-encoded genomes. Identifying mutations with low fitness cost is pivotal as this increases the number that can be introduced and generates more stable and attenuated viruses. Here, we sought to identify mutations with low deleterious impact on the in vivo replication and virulence of yellow fever virus (YFV). Following comparative bioinformatic analyses of flaviviral genomes, we categorized synonymous transition mutations according to their impact on CpG/UpA composition and secondary RNA structures. We then designed 17 re-encoded viruses with 100-400 synonymous mutations in the NS2A-to-NS4B coding region of YFV Asibi and Ap7M (hamster-adapted) genomes. Each virus contained a panel of synonymous mutations designed according to the above categorisation criteria. The replication and fitness characteristics of parent and re-encoded viruses were compared in vitro using cell culture competition experiments. In vivo laboratory hamster models were also used to compare relative virulence and immunogenicity characteristics. Most of the re-encoded strains showed no decrease in replicative fitness in vitro. However, they showed reduced virulence and, in some instances, decreased replicative fitness in vivo. Importantly, the most attenuated of the re-encoded strains induced robust, protective immunity in hamsters following challenge with Ap7M, a virulent virus. Overall, the introduction of transitions with no or a marginal increase in the number of CpG/UpA dinucleotides had the mildest impact on YFV replication and virulence in vivo. Thus, this strategy can be incorporated in procedures for the finely tuned creation of substantially re-encoded viral genomes.",

    "abstract": "The selective lysosomal degradation (autophagy) of entire organelles is required for cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation is involved in degenerative disorders such as Parkinsons Disease. While autophagy of mitochondria (mitophagy) is becoming better understood, other forms of organelle autophagy are relatively unexplored. Here we develope multiple quantitative assays to measure organelle autophagy using flow cytometry, microscopy, and Western blotting. Focusing on autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER-phagy), we show that these assays allow facile measurement of ER-phagy, and that ER-phagy is inhibited by knockdown of either core autophagy components or the recently reported FAM134B ER-phagy receptor. Using these assays, we further identify that Atlastins, the ER-resident GTPases involved in ER membrane morphology, are key positive effectors of ER-phagy. Atlastin-depleted cells have decreased ER-phagy under starvation conditions, and Atlastins role in ER-phagy requires both a functional GTPase domain and proper ER localization. The three Atlastin family members functionally compensate for one another during ER-phagy and may form heteromeric complexes with one another. We also find that Atlastins act downstream of the FAM134B ER-phagy receptor. We propose that during ER-phagy, Atlastins remodel ER membrane to separate pieces of FAM134B-marked ER for efficient autophagosomal engulfment. Human mutations in Atlastins led to hereditary spastic paraplegia, and our results suggest that this disease may be linked to deficiencies in ER-phagy rather than ER morphology.",

Here, we optogenetically stimulated different genetically defined interneurons (parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)) in visual cortex (V1) of mice working at threshold in contrast increment or decrement detection tasks. The visual stimulus was paired with optogenetic stimulation to assess how enhancing V1 inhibitory neuron activity synchronously during cortical responses altered task performance. PV or SST activation impaired, while VIP stimulation improved, contrast increment detection. Notably, PV or SST stimulation also impaired contrast decrement detection, when opsin-evoked inhibition would exaggerate stimulus-evoked decrements in firing rate, and thus might improve performance. The impairment produced by PV or SST stimulation persisted throughout many weeks of testing. In contrast mice learned to reliably detect VIP activation in the absence of natural visual stimulation. Thus, different inhibitory signals make distinct contributions to visual contrast perception.",

Automated high-frequency monitoring of these communities is presently limited by the absence of repeatable, rapid protocols to analyse SFCM datasets, where images of individual particles are not available. Here we demonstrate a repeatable, semi-automated method to (1) rapidly clean SFCM data from a phytoplankton community by removing signals that do not belong to live phytoplankton cells, (2) classify individual cells into trait clusters that correspond to functional groups, and (3) quantify the biovolumes of individual cells, the total biovolume of the whole community and the total biovolumes of the major functional groups. Our method involves the development of training datasets using lab cultures, the use of an unsupervised clustering algorithm to identify trait clusters, and machine learning tools (random forests) to (1) evaluate variable importance, (2) classify data points, and (3) estimate biovolumes of individual cells. We provide example datasets and R code for our analytical approach that can be adapted for analysis of datasets from other flow cytometers or scanning flow cytometers.",

    "abstract": "Biogenic amine neurotransmitters play a central role in metazoan biology, and both their chemical structures and cognate receptors are evolutionarily conserved. Their primary roles are in intra-organismal signaling, whereas biogenic amines are not normally recruited for communication between separate individuals. Here, we show that in C. elegans, a neurotransmitter-sensing G protein-coupled receptor, TYRA-2, is required for avoidance responses to osas#9, an ascaroside pheromone that incorporates the neurotransmitter octopamine. Neuronal ablation, cell-specific genetic rescue, and calcium imaging show that tyra-2 expression in the nociceptive neuron ASH is necessary and sufficient to induce osas#9 avoidance. Ectopic expression in the AWA neuron, which is generally associated with attractive responses, reverses the response to osas#9, resulting in attraction instead of avoidance behavior, confirming that TYRA-2 partakes in sensing osas#9. The TYRA-2/osas#9 signaling system thus represents an inter-organismal communication channel that evolved via co-option of a neurotransmitter and its cognate receptor.",

Channelrhodopsin-2 has been widely used as a tool to probe circuit function in vitro and in vivo. Several recently developed ChR variants are characterized by faster kinetics and reduced desensitization. However, little is known about how their varying properties may regulate their interaction with local network dynamics. We compared ChR-evoked patterns of multi-unit activity and local field potentials in primary visual cortex of mice expressing three ChR variants with distinct temporal profiles: Chronos, Chrimson, and ChR2. We assessed overall activation of by measuring the amplitude and temporal progression of evoked spiking. Using gamma-range (30-80Hz) LFP power as an assay for local network engagement, we examined the recruitment of cortical network activity by each tool. All ChR variants caused light-evoked increases in firing in vivo, but each demonstrated different temporal patterning of evoked activity. In addition, the three ChRs had distinct effects on cortical gamma-band activity. Our findings suggest that variations in the kinetics of optogenetic tools can substantially affect their efficacy in neural networks in vivo, as well as the manner in which their activation engages circuit resonance.",

    "abstract": "Steinernema carpocapsae is an entomopathogenic nematode that employs nictation and jumping behaviours to find host insects. We aimed to investigate the transcriptional basis of variant host-finding behaviours in the infective juvenile (IJ) stage of three S. carpocapsae strains (ALL, Breton and UK1). RNA-seq analysis revealed that whilst up to 28% of the S. carpocapsae transcriptome was differentially expressed (P<0.0001) between strains, remarkably few of the most highly differentially expressed genes (>2 log2 fold change, P<0.0001) were from neuronal gene families. S. carpocapsae Breton displays increased chemotaxis toward the laboratory host Galleria mellonella, relative to the other strains. This correlates with the up-regulation of four srsx chemosensory GPCR genes, and a sodium transporter gene, asic-2, relative to both ALL and UK1 strains. The UK1 strain exhibits a decreased nictation phenotype relative to ALL and Breton strains, which correlates with co-ordinate up-regulation of neuropeptide like protein 36 (nlp-36), and down-regulation of an srt family GPCR gene, and a distinct asic-2-like sodium channel paralogue. To further investigate the link between transcriptional regulation and behavioural variation, we sequenced microRNAs across IJs of each strain. We have identified 283 high confidence microRNA genes, yielding 321 isomiR variants in S. carpocapsae, and find that up to 36% of microRNAs are differentially expressed (P<0.0001) between strains. Many of the most highly differentially expressed microRNAs (>2 log2 fold, P<0.0001) are predicted to regulate a variety of neuronal genes that may contribute to variant host-finding behaviours. We have also found evidence for differential gene isoform usage between strains, which alters predicted microRNA interactions, and could contribute to the diversification of behaviour. These data provide deeper insight to the transcriptional landscape of behavioural variation in S. carpocapsae, underpinning efforts to functionally dissect the parasite host-finding apparatus.\\n\\nAuthor summarySteinernema carpocapsae is a lethal parasite of insects. In order to find and invade a host insect, the S. carpocapsae infective juvenile will typically stand upright, waving its anterior in the air as it searches for host-specific cues. When the infective juvenile senses insect volatile compounds and movement (both signals are required), it will attempt to jump towards the source of those stimuli. Whilst the jumping behaviour is unique to Steinernema species nematodes, nictation is a host-finding behaviour shared with other important parasites of medical and veterinary importance. We have found that different strains of S. carpocpsae use modified host-finding strategies, and that these behavioural differences correlate with gene expression patterns, identifying genes that may be crucial in regulating aspects of host-finding. We also assessed the complement of microRNAs, which are small non-coding RNAs that regulate target gene expression. We found a surprising difference in the abundance of shared microRNAs between strains of S. carpocapsae; these differences also reveal expression differences that correlate with behavioural variation. Predicted microRNA target genes suggest that microRNA variation could significantly influence the behaviour of nematodes. Broadly, this study provides insight to the relationship between gene expression and behaviour, paving the way for detailed studies on gene function.",

    "abstract": "Accurate protein structure prediction from amino acid sequence is still an unsolved problem. The most reliable methods centre on template based modelling. However, the accuracy of these models entirely depends on the availability of experimentally resolved homologous template structures. In order to generate more accurate models, extensive physics based molecular dynamics (MD) refinement simulations are performed to sample many different conformations to find improved conformational states. In this study, we propose a deep recurrent network model, called DeepTrajectory, that is able to identify these improved conformational states, with high precision, from a variety of different MD based sampling protocols. The proposed model learns the temporal patterns of features computed from the MD trajectory data in order to classify whether each recorded simulation snapshot is an improved conformational state, decreased conformational state or a none perceivable change in state with respect to the starting conformation. The model is trained and tested on 904 trajectories from 42 different protein systems with a cumulative number of more than 1.7 million snapshots. We show that our model outperforms other state of the art machine-learning algorithms that do not consider temporal dependencies. To our knowledge, DeepTrajectory is the first implementation of a time-dependent deep-learning protocol that is re-trainable and able to adapt to any new MD based sampling procedure, thereby demonstrating how a neural network can be used to learn the latter part of the protein folding funnel.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of the mean greater shell dimensions of 2446 genera of stylommatophoran land snails consists of two groups peaking at 3 mm and 15.3 mm. The 3-mm group includes the miniature snails whose adult shell dimensions range from almost 0.8 mm to less than 1.5 mm. Relative surface area, shell thickness and egg size are discussed as potential factors that may limit the minimum shell dimensions. To obtain uniform distributions, the shell shape is expressed as the expanse angle, defined as the apex angle of a right triangle the height and the base of which are the shell height and diameter, respectively. In terms of expanse angles there are three shell shapes: tall (< 40{degrees}), flat (> 50{degrees}) and roughly equiaxial (40{degrees}-50{degrees}). The variation of shell shape with size was analyzed within the morphospace they form. At shell dimensions above 10 mm the lowest expanse angle is about 10{degrees}. Below 10 mm, the lower limit of the expanse angle increases as shells get smaller. As a result, no miniature species has a tall shell. It is proposed that two evolutionary functional constraints render small and narrow shells of miniaturized snails nonadaptive. These are the requirements to reduce surface areas to decrease water loss and to have enough volume and a wide enough body whorl to accommodate at least one egg.",

    "abstract": "Encoding of a sensory stimulus is believed to be the first step in perceptual decision making. Previous research has shown that electrical signals recorded from the human brain track evidence accumulation during perceptual decision making (Gold and Shadlen, 2007; OConnell et al., 2012; Philiastides et al., 2014). In this study we directly tested the hypothesis that the latency of the N200 recorded by EEG (a negative peak occurring between 150 and 275 ms after stimulus presentation in human participants) reflects the visual encoding time (VET) required for completion of figure-ground segregation before evidence accumulation. We show that N200 latencies vary across individuals, are modulated by external visual noise, and increase response time by x milliseconds when they increase by x milliseconds, reflecting a linear regression slope of 1. Simulations of cognitive decision-making theory show that variation in human response times not related to evidence accumulation (including VET) are tracked by the fastest response times. A relationship with a slope of 1 between N200 latencies and VET was found by fitting a linear model between trial-averaged N200 latencies and the 10th percentiles of response times. A slope of 1 was also found between single-trial N200 latencies and response times. Fitting a novel neuro-cognitive model of decision-making also yielded a slope of 1 between N200 latency and non-decision time in multiple visual noise conditions, indicating that N200 latencies track the completion of visual encoding and the onset of evidence accumulation. The N200 waveforms were localized to the cortical surface at distributed temporal and extrastriate locations, consistent with a distributed network engaged in figure-ground segregation of the target stimulus.\\n\\nSignificance StatementEncoding of a sensory stimulus is believed to be the first step in perceptual decision making. In this study, we report evidence that visual evoked potentials (EPs) around 200 ms after stimulus presentation track the time of visual figure-ground segregation before the onset of evidence accumulation during decision making. These EP latencies vary across individuals, are modulated by external visual noise, and increase response time by x milliseconds when they increase by x milliseconds. Hierarchical Bayesian model-fitting was also used to relate these EPs to a specific cognitive parameter that tracks time related to visual encoding in a decision-making model of response time. This work adds to the growing literature that suggests that EEG signals can track the component cognitive processes of decision making.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory projection neurons convey information from the insect antennal lobe (AL) to higher centers in the brain. Many studies on moths have reported excitatory projection neurons with cell bodies in the medial cell cluster (mcPNs) that predominantly send an axon from the AL to calyces of the mushroom body (CA) via the medial antennal lobe tract (mALT) and then to the lateral horn (LH) of the protocerebrum. These neurons tend to have dendritic arbors restricted to a single glomerulus (i.e. they are uniglomerular). In this study, we report on the physiological and morphological properties of a group of pheromone-responsive olfactory projection neurons with cell bodies in the moth AL lateral cell cluster (lcPNs) of two heliothine moth species. While mcPNs typically exhibit a narrow odor tuning range related to the restriction of their dendritic arbors within a single glomerulus, lcPNs exhibited an array of morphological and physiological configurations. Pheromone-responsive lcPNs varied in their associations with glomeruli (uniglomerular and multiglomerular), dendritic arborization structure and connections to higher brain centers with projections primarily through the lateral antennal lobe tract and to a lesser extent the mediolateral antennal lobe tract to a variety of protocerebral targets including ventrolateral and superior neuropils as well as LH. Physiological characterization of lcPNs also revealed a diversity of response profiles including those either enhanced by or reliant upon presentation of a pheromone blend. These responses manifested themselves as higher maximum firing rates and/or improved temporal resolution of pulsatile stimuli. lcPNs therefore participate in conveying a variety of olfactory information relating to qualitative and temporal facets of the pheromone stimulus to a more expansive number of protocerebral targets than their mcPN counterparts. The role of lcPNs in the overall scheme of olfactory processing is discussed.",

Difficulties in treating GBM include not only the inability to resect the diffusively-invading tumor cells but also therapeutic resistance. The perivascular niche (PVN) within the GBM tumor microenvironment contributes significantly to tumor cell invasion, cancer stem cell maintenance, and has been shown to protect tumor cells from radiation and chemotherapy. In this study, we examine how the inclusion of non-tumor cells in culture with tumor cells within a hydrogel impacts the overall gene expression profile of an in vitro artificial perivascular niche (PVN) comprised of endothelial and stromal cells directly cultured with GBM tumor cells within a methacrylamide-functionalized gelatin hydrogel. Using RNA-seq, we demonstrate that genes related to angiogenesis and remodeling are upregulated in the PVN model compared to hydrogels containing only tumor or perivascular niche cells, while downregulated genes are related to cell cycle and DNA damage repair. Signaling pathways and genes commonly implicated in GBM malignancy, such as MGMT, EGFR, PI3K-Akt signaling, and Ras/MAPK signaling are also upregulated in the PVN model. We describe the kinetics of gene expression within the PVN hydrogels over a course of 14 days, observing the patterns associated with tumor cell-mediated endothelial network co-option and regression. We finally examine the effect of temozolomide, a frontline chemotherapy used clinically against GBM, on the PVN culture. Notably, the PVN model is less responsive to TMZ compared to hydrogels containing only tumor cells. Overall, these results demonstrate that inclusion of cellular and matrix-associated elements of the PVN within an in vitro model of GBM allows for the development of gene expression patterns and therapeutic response relevant to GBM.",

    "abstract": "MotivationRecently, next-generation sequencing techniques have been applied for the detection of RNA secondary structures called high-throughput RNA structural (HTS) analy- sis, and dozens of different protocols were used to detect comprehensive RNA structures at single-nucleotide resolution. However, the existing computational analyses heavily depend on experimental data generation methodology, which results in many difficulties associated with statistically sound comparisons or combining the results obtained using different HTS methods.\\n\\nResultsHere, we introduced a statistical framework, reactIDR, which is applicable to the experimental data obtained using multiple HTS methodologies, and it classifies the nucleotides into three structural categories, stem, loop, and unmapped. reactIDR uses the irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) with a hidden Markov model (HMM) to discriminate accurately between the true and spurious signals obtained in the replicated HTS experiments. In reactIDR, IDR and HMM parameters are efficiently optimized by using an expectation-maximization algorithm. Furthermore, if known reference structures are given, a supervised learning can be applicable in a semi-supervised manner. The results of our analyses for real HTS data showed that reactIDR achieved the highest accuracy in the classification problem of stem/loop structures of rRNA using both individual and integrated HTS datasets as well as the best correspondence with the three-dimensional structure. Because reactIDR is the first method to compare HTS datasets obtained from multiple sources in a single unified model, it has a great potential to increase the accuracy of RNA secondary structure prediction at transcriptome-wide level with further experiments performed.\\n\\nAvailabilityreactIDR is implemented in Python.

    "abstract": "Because biodiversity is multidimensional and scale-dependent, it is challenging to estimate its change. However, it is unclear (1) how much scale-dependence matters for empirical studies, and (2) if it does matter, how exactly we should quantify biodiversity change. To address the first question, we analyzed studies with comparisons among multiple assemblages, and found that rarefaction curves frequently crossed, implying reversals in the ranking of species richness across spatial scales. Moreover, the most frequently measured aspect of diversity--species richness--was poorly correlated with other measures of diversity. Second, we collated studies that included spatial scale in their estimates of biodiversity change in response to ecological drivers and found frequent and strong scale-dependence, including nearly 10% of studies which showed that biodiversity changes switched directions across scales. Having established the complexity of empirical biodiversity comparisons, we describe a synthesis of methods based on rarefaction curves that allow more explicit analyses of spatial and sampling effects on biodiversity comparisons. We use a case study of nutrient additions in experimental ponds to illustrate how this multi-dimensional and multi-scale perspective informs the responses of biodiversity to ecological drivers.\\n\\nStatement of AuthorshipJC and BM conceived the study and the overall approach, and all authors participated in multiple working group meetings to develop and refine the approach.

    "abstract": "Animals often have to evaluate and choose between multiple food sources in their habitat, and these potentially complex decisions can have a large impact on their fitness. Among other factors, previous experience with an alternative resource can significantly increase subsequent preference for the resource (\\\"induction of preference\\\"). Such induction of resource preference is particularly relevant in spatially or temporally heterogeneous habitats. Although most mobile species - especially generalists - probably frequently encounter habitat heterogeneity, the impact of preference induction on individual behaviour and fitness in heterogeneous habitats is poorly understood. We analysed larval preference induction in wheat-adapted generalist red flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) under three types of habitat heterogeneity. We first analysed the induction of larval preference for novel resources (other cereal flours) under temporal heterogeneity, exposing larvae to new resources during development. We found that larvae preferred a new resource if they experienced it recently, but that the magnitude of induction varied across resources. Interestingly, we also observed specific induction for a homogenous mix of wheat and a novel resource, with larvae preferring the mix over either pure resource. To analyse induction under spatial heterogeneity, we placed beetle eggs in one of two alternative resource patches and tested the preference of emerged larvae. Unexpectedly, hatching into a novel resource did not always induce preference. Finally, we found that induction of preference for new resources could be maladaptive for larval development. Together, our work demonstrates that experience-based plasticity of larval resource choice may strongly impact larval preference and fitness in heterogeneous habitats.",

    "abstract": "Sexual recombination only occurs in eukaryotes; however, many bacteria can actively recombine with environmental DNA. This behavior, referred to as transformation, has been described in many species from diverse taxonomic backgrounds. Transformation is hypothesized to carry some selective advantages similar to those postulated for meiotic sex in eukaryotes. However, the accumulation of loss-of-function alleles at transformation loci and an increased mutational load from recombining with DNA from dead cells create additional costs to transformation. These costs have been shown to outweigh many of the benefits of recombination under a variety of likely parameters. We investigate an additional proposed benefit of sexual recombination, the Red Queen hypothesis, as it relates to bacterial transformation. Here we describe a model showing that host-pathogen coevolution may provide a large selective benefit to transformation and allow transforming cells to invade an environment dominated by otherwise equal non-transformers. Furthermore, we observe that host-pathogen dynamics cause the selection pressure on transformation to vary extensively in time, potentially explaining the tight regulation and wide variety of rates observed in naturally competent bacteria. Host-pathogen dynamics may explain the evolution and maintenance of natural competence despite its associated costs.",

    "abstract": "Maternal obesity associates with multiple adverse reproductive outcomes, negatively affecting the health and survival of both the mother and the fetus. The contributory effects of obesity on adipose-derived immune changes have been well established, however the mechanisms that link obesity to pregnancy complications remain unclear. Proper development of the placenta and establishment of utero-placental vasculature is essential in early pregnancy to allow for optimal fetal growth and survival. Uterine immune cells, particularly uterine natural killer (uNK) cells, play fundamental roles in promoting these events. Using an obesogenic high-fat/high-sucrose (HFD) mouse model of maternal obesity, uNK cells and placenta/uterine vascular remodeling were examined at gestational days (Gd) 10.5 and 14.5 of pregnancy. While mice fed a HFD 13 weeks prior to pregnancy significantly gained more weight than control mice fed a low-fat/no-sucrose diet (LFD), fetal survival was not different in either diet. At Gd 10.5, HFD had no effect on total uNK proportions, nor did it affect proportions of distinct CD122+/CD49a tissue resident or CD122+/DX5+ conventional uNKs. However, HFD resulted in increased proportions of NCR1+ uNK and overall heightened uNK activity. Moreover, HFD resulted in impairments in uterine vascular remodeling at Gd10.5. By Gd14.5, uterine artery defects were no longer observed and placental structure was comparable between HFD and LFD mice. Gene analysis of IFN{gamma}, TNF and VEGFA in Gd10.5 uNK indicated that, while not significant, a HFD leads to subtle alterations in uNK cytokine gene expression. These findings show that HFD in mice results in changes in uNK biology and temporary uterine artery remodeling impairments. Further, this work establishes insight into the cellular changes occurring in early pregnancy as a result of HFD exposure.",

To better understand the functional capacity of E. faecalis we constructed a broad host range RP4 mobilisable vector, pEHR513112, that confers chloramphenicol resistance and used a metaparental mating approach to isolate E. faecalis AHG0090 from a faecal sample collected from a healthy human infant. We demonstrated that E. faecalis AHG0090 is genetically tractable and could be manipulated using traditional molecular microbiology approaches. E. faecalis AHG0090 was comparable to the gold-standard anti-inflammatory bacterium Faecalibacterium prausnitzii A2-165 in its ability to suppress cytokine mediated NF-[Kcy]B activation in human gut derived LS174T goblet cell-like and Caco-2 enterocyte-like cell lines. E. faecalis AHG0090 and F. prausnitzii A2-165 produced secreted low molecular weight NF-[Kcy]B suppressive peptidic bioactives. Both bioactives were sensitive to heat and proteinase K treatments although the E. faecalis AHG0090 bioactive was more resilient to both forms of treatment. As expected, E. faecalis AHG0090 suppressed IL-1{beta} induced NF-[Kcy]B-p65 subunit nuclear translocation and expression of the NF-[Kcy]B regulated genes IL-6, IL-8 and CXCL-10.

    "abstract": "The impermeability barrier provided by the outer membrane of enteric bacteria, a feature lacking in Gram-positive bacteria, plays a major role in maintaining resistance to numerous antimicrobial compounds and antibiotics. Here we demonstrate that mutational inactivation of spr, coding for a muramyl endopeptidase, significantly sensitizes Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to vancomycin without any accompanying apparent growth defect or outer membrane destabilization. A similar phenotype was not achieved by deleting the mepA, pbpG, nlpC, yebA or yhdO genes coding for functional homologues to Spr. The spr mutant revealed increased autolytic behavior in response to not only vancomycin, but also to penicillin G, an antibiotic for which the mutant displayed a wild-type MIC. A screen for suppressor mutations of the spr mutant phenotype revealed that deletion of tsp (prc), encoding a periplasmic carboxypeptidase involved in processing Spr and PBP3, restored intrinsic resistance to vancomycin and reversed the autolytic phenotype of an spr mutant. Our data suggest that Spr contributes to intrinsic antibiotic resistance in S. Typhimurium without directly affecting the outer membrane permeability barrier. Furthermore, our data suggests that compounds that target specific cell wall endopeptidases might have the potential to expand the activity spectrum of traditional Gram-positive antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe interplay between metabolic processes and signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Global, detailed and comprehensive reconstructions of human metabolism and signalling pathways exist in the form of molecular maps, but they have never been integrated together. We aim at filling in this gap by creating an integrated resource of both signalling and metabolic pathways allowing a visual exploration of multi-level omics data and study of cross-regulatory circuits between these processes in health and in disease.\\n\\nResultsWe combined two comprehensive manually curated network maps. Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network (ACSN), containing mechanisms frequently implicated in cancer; and ReconMap 2.0, a comprehensive reconstruction of human metabolic network. We linked ACSN and ReconMap 2.0 maps via common players and represented the two maps as interconnected layers using the NaviCell platform for maps exploration. In addition, proteins catalysing metabolic reactions in ReconMap 2.0 were not previously visually represented on the map canvas. This precluded visualisation of omics data in the context of ReconMap 2.0. We suggested a solution for displaying protein nodes on the ReconMap 2.0 map in the vicinity of the corresponding reaction or process nodes. This permits multi-omics data visualisation in the context of both map layers. Exploration and shuttling between the two map layers is possible using Google Maps-like features of NaviCell. The integrated ACSN-ReconMap 2.0 resource is accessible online and allows data visualisation through various modes such as markers, heat maps, bar-plots, glyphs and map staining. The integrated resource was applied for comparison of immunoreactive and proliferative ovarian cancer subtypes using transcriptomic, copy number and mutation multi-omics data. A certain number of metabolic and signalling processes specifically deregulated in each of the ovarian cancer sub-types were identified.\\n\\nConclusionsAs knowledge evolves and new omics data becomes more heterogeneous, gathering together existing domains of biology under common platforms is essential. We believe that an integrated ACSN-ReconMap 2.0 resource will help in understanding various disease mechanisms and discovery of new interactions at the intersection of cell signalling and metabolism. In addition, the successful integration of metabolic and signalling networks allows broader systems biology approach application for data interpretation and retrieval of intervention points to tackle simultaneously the key players coordinating signalling and metabolism in human diseases.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of robotic instruments is an important problem for the robot-assisted surgery. One of the main challenges is to correctly detect an instruments position for the tracking and pose estimation in the vicinity of surgical scenes. Accurate pixel-wise instrument segmentation is needed to address this challenge. In this paper we describe our deep learning-based approach for robotic instrument segmentation. Our approach demonstrates an improvement over the state-of-the-art results using several novel deep neural network architectures. It addressed the binary segmentation problem, where every pixel in an image is labeled as an instrument or background from the surgery video feed. In addition, we solve a multi-class segmentation problem, in which we distinguish between different instruments or different parts of an instrument from the background. In this setting, our approach outperforms other methods for automatic instrument segmentation thereby providing state-of-the-art results for these problems. The source code for our solution is made publicly available.",

Methanogenesis depends on the availability of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methanol and acetate produced, which are metabolic products of anaerobic microbial degradation of feed-derived fibers. Changing the feed composition of the ruminants has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate methanogenesis of the rumen microbiota.\\n\\nWe investigated the impact of corn silage enhanced diets on the rumen microbiota of rumen-fistulated dairy cows, with a special focus on carbohydrate breakdown and methanogenesis. Metatranscriptome analysis of rumen samples taken from animals fed corn silage enhanced diets revealed that genes involved in starch metabolism were significantly more expressed while archaeal genes involved in methanogenesis showed lower expression values. The nutritional intervention also influenced the cross-feeding between Archaea and Bacteria.\\n\\nThe results indicate that the ruminant diet is important in methanogenesis. The diet-induced changes resulted in a reduced methane emission. The metatranscriptomic analysis provided insights into key underlying mechanisms and opens the way for new rational methods to further reduce methane output of ruminant animals.",

We demonstrate increasing cell length is accompanied by a large increase in flexibility. Using a microfluidic assay to measure single-cell mechanics, we identified large differences in swarmer cell stiffness of (bending rigidity of P. mirabilis, 9.6 x 10-22 N m2; V. parahaemolyticus, 9.7 x 10-23 N m2) compared to vegetative cells (1.4 x 10-20 N m2 and 3.2 x 10-22 N m2, respectively). The reduction in bending rigidity (~3-15 fold) was accompanied by a decrease in the average polysaccharide strand length of the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall from 28-30 to 19-22 disaccharides. Atomic force microscopy revealed a reduction in P. mirabilis peptidoglycan thickness from 1.5 nm (vegetative) to 1.0 nm (swarmer) and electron cryotomography indicated changes in swarmer cell wall morphology. P. mirabilis and V. parahaemolyticus swarmer cells became increasingly sensitive to osmotic pressure and susceptible to cell wall-modifying antibiotics (compared to vegetative cells)--they were ~30% more likely to die after 3 h of treatment with minimum inhibitory concentrations of the {beta}-lactams cephalexin and penicillin G. The adaptive cost of swarming is offset by the increase in cell susceptibility to physical and chemical changes in their environment, thereby suggesting the development of new chemotherapies for bacteria that leverage swarming for colonization of hosts and survival.\n\nImportanceProteus mirabilis and Vibrio parahaemolyticus are bacteria that infect humans. To adapt to environmental changes, these bacteria alter their cell morphology and move collectively to access new sources of nutrients in a process referred to as  swarming. We found that a change in the composition and thickness of the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall makes swarmer cells of P. mirabilis and V. parahaemolyticus more flexible (i.e., reduced cell stiffness) and increases their sensitivity to osmotic pressure and cell-wall targeting antibiotics (e.g., {beta}-lactams). These results highlight the importance of assessing the extracellular environment in determining antibiotic doses and the use of {beta}-lactams antibiotics for treating infections caused by swarmer cells of P. mirabilis and V. parahaemolyticus.",

    "abstract": "Influenza is a global problem infecting 5-10 % of adults and 20-30 % of children annually. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are attractive approaches to complement vaccination in the prevention and reduction of influenza. Strong cyclical reduction of absolute humidity has been associated with influenza outbreaks in temperate climates. This study tested the hypothesis that raising absolute humidity above seasonal lows would impact influenza virus survival and transmission in a key source of influenza distribution, a community school. Air samples and objects handled by students (e.g. blocks and markers) were collected from preschool classrooms. All samples were processed and PCR used to determine the presence of influenza and its amount. Additionally samples were tested for their ability to infect cells in cultures. Deliberate classroom humidification (with commercial steam humidifiers) resulted in a significant reduction of the total number of influenza positive samples (air and fomite), viral copy number, and efficiency of viral infectivity. This is the first prospective study suggesting that exogenous humidification could serve as a scalable NPI for influenza or other viral outbreaks.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHuman influenza infections have a substantial impact on society (including lost productivity and medical costs). Children, 3-4 years of age are the main introducers and spreaders of influenza within a household and community. There is evidence from laboratory and epidemiological studies that suggests that low humidity in winter (in temperate climates) may increase the ability of influenza virus to survive and spread between individuals. We wanted to know if added in humidity (through steam humidifiers) could reduce the amount of influenza present and its spread within preschool classrooms (students aged 3-4 years)? Additionally, we looked at the infectivity of the influenza isolated and if there were differences in the number of students with influenza-like illnesses during our study. We show that humidification can reduce the amount of influenza present within samples from preschool classrooms and that there were fewer infectious samples compared to non-humidified rooms. There were small numbers of students ill with influenza like illnesses during our study so additional studies will need to look further at humidification as a way to reduce influenza infection and transmission.",

    "abstract": "It is an uninformative truism to state that the brain operates at multiple spatial and temporal scales, each with each own set of emergent phenomena. More worthy of attention is the point that our current understanding of it cannot clearly indicate which of these phenomenological scales are the significant contributors to the brains function and primary output (i.e. behaviour). Apart from the sheer complexity of the problem, a major contributing factor to this state of affairs is the lack of instrumentation that can simultaneously address these multiple scales without causing function altering damages to the underlying tissue. One important facet of this problem is that standard neural recording devices normally require one output connection per electrode. This limits the number of electrodes that can fit along the thin shafts of implantable probes generating a limiting balance between density and spread. Sharing a single output connection between multiple electrodes relaxes this constraint and permits designs of ultra-high density probes.\n\nHere we report the design and in-vivo validation of such a device, a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) scanning probe with 1344 electrodes; the outcome of the European research project NeuroSeeker. We show that this design targets both local and global spatial scales by allowing the simultaneous recording of more than 1000 neurons spanning 7 functional regions with a single shaft. The neurons show similar recording longevity and signal to noise ratio to passive probes of comparable size and no adverse effects in awake or anesthetized animals. Addressing the data management of this device we also present novel visualization and monitoring methods. Using the probe with freely moving animals we show how accessing a number of cortical and subcortical brain regions offers a novel perspective on how the brain operates around salient behavioural events. Finally, we compare this probe with lower density, non CMOS designs (which have to adhere to the one electrode per output line rule). We show that an increase in density results in capturing neural firing patterns, undetectable by lower density devices, which correlate to self-similar structures inherent in complex naturalistic behaviour.\n\nTo help design electrode configurations for future, even higher density, CMOS probes, recordings from many different brain regions were obtained with an ultra-dense passive probe.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging research has shown that different cognitive tasks induce relatively specific activation patterns, as well as less task-specific deactivation patterns. Here we examined whether individual differences in Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity during task performance correlate with the magnitude of task-induced deactivation. In an fMRI study, participants performed a continuous mental arithmetic task in a task/rest block design, while undergoing combined fMRI and heart / respiration rate acquisitions using photoplethysmograph and respiration belt. As expected, task performance increased heart-rate and reduced the RMSSD, a cardiac index related to vagal tone. Across participants, higher heart rate during task was linked to increased activation in fronto-parietal regions, as well as to stronger deactivation in ventromedial prefrontal regions. Respiration frequency during task was associated with similar patterns, but in different regions than those identified for heart-rate. Finally, in a large set of regions, almost exclusively limited to the Default Mode Network, lower RMSSD was associated with greater deactivation, and furthermore, the vast majority of these regions were task-deactivated at the group level. Together, our findings show that inter-individual differences in ANS activity are strongly linked to task-induced deactivation. Importantly, our findings suggest that deactivation is a multifaceted construct potentially linked to ANS control, because distinct ANS measures correlate with deactivation in different regions. We discuss the implications for current theories of cortical control of the ANS and for accounts of deactivation, with particular reference to studies documenting a \\\"failure to deactivate\\\" in multiple clinical states.",

    "abstract": "Psychophysical procedures are applied in various fields to assess sensory thresholds. During experiments, sampled psychometric functions are usually assumed to be stationary. However, perception can be altered, for example by loss of attention to the presentation of stimuli, leading to biased data which results in poor threshold estimates. The few existing approaches attempting to identify non-stationarities either detect only whether there was a change in perception, or are not suitable for experiments with a relatively small number of trials (e.g., < 300). We present a method to detect inattention periods on a trial-by-trial basis to improve threshold estimates in psychophysical experiments using the adaptive sampling procedure Parameter Estimation by Sequential Testing (PEST). The performance of the algorithm was evaluated in computer simulations modeling inattention, and tested in a behavioral experiment on proprioceptive difference threshold assessment in 20 stroke patients, a population where attention deficits are likely to be present. Simulations showed that estimation errors could be reduced by up to 77% for inattentive subjects, even in sequences with less than 100 trials. In the behavioral data, inattention was detected in 14% of assessments, and applying the proposed algorithm resulted in reduced test-retest variability in 73% of these corrected assessments pairs. The algorithm complements existing approaches and can be adapted to sampling procedures other than PEST. Besides being applicable post-hoc, it could also be used online to prevent collection of biased data. This could have important implications in assessment practice by shortening experiments and improving estimates.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decisions about the state of the environment are often made in the face of uncertain evidence. Internal uncertainty signals are considered important regulators of learning and decision-making. A growing body of work has implicated the brains arousal systems in uncertainty signaling. Here, we found that two specific computational variables, postulated by recent theoretical work, evoke boosts of arousal at different times during a perceptual decision: decision confidence (the observers internally estimated probability that a choice was correct given the evidence) before feedback, and prediction errors (deviations from expected reward) after feedback. We monitored pupil diameter, a peripheral marker of central arousal state, while subjects performed a challenging perceptual choice task with a delayed monetary reward. We quantified evoked pupil responses during decision formation and after reward-linked feedback. During both intervals, decision difficulty and accuracy had interacting effects on pupil responses. Pupil responses negatively scaled with decision confidence prior to feedback and scaled with uncertainty-dependent prediction errors after feedback. This pattern of pupil responses during both intervals was in line with a model using the observers graded belief about choice accuracy to anticipate rewards and compute prediction errors. We conclude that pupil-linked arousal systems are modulated by internal belief states.",

    "abstract": "Several recent studies have demonstrated the association of cat-related injuries with major depression and with depressiveness in the general population. It was suggested that cat-scratch disease, the infection with the bacterium Bartonella henselae, can be responsible for the observed association. However, no direct evidence for the role of the Bartonella infection in this association has been published until now. In this preregistered case-controls study performed on 250 healthy subjects tested earlier for the presence of anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibodies, we searched for the positive association between presence of anamnestic anti-Bartonella IgG antibodies and depressiveness measured with Beck II inventory, depression subscale of neuroticism measured with N-70 questionnaire, and self-reported health problems. We found that that Bartonella-seropositivity was positively correlated with Beck depression only in Toxoplasma-seronegative men and negatively correlated with health in Toxoplasma-seronegative women. Bartonella seropositivity expressed protective effects against Toxoplasma seropositivity-associated increased neuroticism in men while Toxoplasma-seropositivity expressed protective effects against Bartonella seropositivity-associated health problems in women. A comparison of the patterns of association of mental and physical health problems with Bartonella seropositivity and with reported cat-related injury suggests that different factor, possibly infection with different pathogen transmitted by cat related-injuries than the Bartonella henselae, is responsible for the observed association of cat related-injuries with depressiveness and major depression. The existence of complex interactions between Bartonella seropositivity, Toxoplasma seropositivity, and sex also suggest that the effect of symbionts on the host's phenotype must by always studied in the context of other infections, and separately for men and women.",

    "abstract": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the herpetic virus, which infects 45-100% people worldwide. Many reports suggest that CMV could impair cognitive functions of infected subjects. Here we searched for indices of effects of CMV on infected subjects' intelligence and knowledge. The Intelligence Structure Test I S T 2000 R was used to compare IQ of 148 CMV infected and 135 CMV free university students. Infected students expressed higher intelligence. Paradoxically, their IQ decreased with decreasing concentration of anti CMV antibodies, which can be used, statistically, as a proxy of the time passed from the moment of infection in young subjects when the age of subjects is statistically controlled. The paradox of seemingly higher intelligence of CMV infected subjects could be explained by the presence of the subpopulation of about 5-10 % CMV positive individuals in the population of \"CMV negative students\". These false negative subjects had probably not only the oldest infections and therefore the lowest concentration of anamnestic antibodies, but also the lowest intelligence among the infected students. Prevalence of CMV infection in all countries is very high, approaching sometimes 90 %. Therefore, the total impact of CMV on human intelligence may be large.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) synthetic hydrogels have recently emerged as desirable in vitro cell culture platforms capable of representing the extracellular geometry, elasticity, and water content of tissue in a tunable fashion. However, they are critically limited in their biological functionality. Hydrogels are typically decorated with a scant 1-3 peptide moieties to direct cell behavior, which vastly underrepresents the proteins found in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of real tissues. Further, peptides chosen are ubiquitous in ECM, and are not derived from specific proteins. We developed an approach to incorporate the protein complexity of specific tissues into the design of biomaterials, and created a hydrogel with the elasticity of marrow, and 20 marrow-specific cell-instructive peptides. Compared to generic PEG hydrogels, our marrow-inspired hydrogel improves stem cell differentiation and proliferation. We propose this tissue-centric approach as the next generation of 3D hydrogel design for applications in tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe diagnosis of multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis is a global health priority. Whole genome sequencing of clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates promises to circumvent the long wait times and limited scope of conventional phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility, but gaps remain for predicting phenotype accurately from genotypic data.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsUsing targeted or whole genome sequencing and conventional drug resistance phenotyping data from 3,601 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, 1,228 of which were multidrug resistant, we investigated the use of machine learning to predict phenotypic drug resistance to 10 anti-tuberculosis drugs. The final model, a multitask wide and deep neural network (MD-WDNN), achieved improved high predictive performance: the average AUCs were 0.979 for first-line drugs and 0.936 for second-line drugs during repeated cross-validation. On an independent validation set, the MD-WDNN showed average AUCs, sensitivities, and specificities, respectively, of 0.937, 87.9%, and 92.7% for first-line drugs and 0.891, 82.0% and 90.1% for second-line drugs. In addition to being able to learn from samples that have only been partially phenotyped, our proposed multidrug architecture shares information across different anti-tuberculosis drugs and genes to provide a more accurate phenotypic prediction. We use t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualization and feature importance analyses to examine inter-drug similarities.\\n\\nConclusionsMachine learning is capable of accurately predicting resistant status using genomic information and holds promise in bringing sequencing technologies closer to the bedside.",

    "abstract": "A common goal of microbiome studies is the elucidation of community composition and member interactions using counts of taxonomic units extracted from sequence data. Inference of interaction networks from sparse and compositional data requires specialised statistical approaches. A popular solution is SparCC, however its performance limits the calculation of interaction networks for very high-dimensional datasets. Here we introduce FastSpar, an efficient and parallelisable implementation of the SparCC algorithm which rapidly infers correlation networks and calculates p-values using an unbiased estimator. We further demonstrate that FastSpar reduces network inference wall time by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to SparCC. FastSpar source code, precompiled binaries, and platform packages are freely available on GitHub: github.com/scwatts/FastSpar",
