    "abstract": "In mammals, genomic regions with enhancer activity turnover rapidly; in contrast, gene expression patterns and transcription factor binding preferences are largely conserved. Based on this conservation, we hypothesized that enhancers active in different mammals would exhibit conserved sequence patterns in spite of their different genomic locations. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the conservation of sequence patterns underlying histone-mark defined enhancers across six diverse mammals in two machine learning frameworks. We first trained support vector machine (SVM) classifiers based on the frequency spectrum of short DNA sequence patterns. These classifiers accurately identified many adult liver, developing limb, and developing brain enhancers in each species. Then, we applied these classifiers across species and found that classifiers trained in one species and tested in another performed nearly as well as classifiers trained and tested on the same species. This indicates that the short sequence patterns predictive of enhancers are largely conserved. We also observed similar cross-species conservation when applying the models to human and mouse enhancers validated in transgenic assays. The sequence patterns most predictive of enhancers in each species matched the binding motifs for a common set of TFs enriched for expression in relevant tissues, supporting the biological relevance of the learned features. To test the conservation of more complex sequences patterns, we trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on enhancer sequences in each species. The CNNs demonstrated better performance overall, but worse cross-species generalization than SVMs, suggesting the importance of combinatorial interactions between motifs, but less conservation of these more complex sequence patterns. Thus, despite the rapid change of active enhancer locations between mammals, cross-species enhancer prediction is often possible. Furthermore, short sequence patterns encoding enhancer activity have been maintained across more than 180 million years of mammalian evolution, with evolutionary change in more complex sequence patterns.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAlterations in gene expression levels are a driving force of both speciation and complex disease; therefore, it is of great importance to understand the mechanisms underlying the evolution and function gene regulatory DNA sequences. Recent studies have revealed that while gene expression patterns and transcription factor binding preferences are broadly conserved across diverse animals, there is extensive turnover in distal gene regulatory regions, called enhancers, between closely related species. We investigate this seeming incongruence by analyzing genome-wide enhancer datasets from six diverse mammalian species. We trained two machine-learning classifiers--a k-mer spectrum support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN)--to distinguish enhancers from the genomic background. The k-mer spectrum SVM models the occurrences of short sequence patterns while the CNN models both the short sequences patterns and their combinatorial patterns. Both the SVM and CNN enhancer prediction models trained in one species are able to predict enhancers in the same cellular context in other species. However, CNNs performed better at predicting enhancers in each species, but they generalize less well across species than the SVMs. This argues that the short sequence properties encoding regulatory activity are remarkably conserved across more than 180 million years of mammalian evolution with more evolutionary turnover in the more complex combinations of the conserved short sequence motifs.",

    "abstract": "Balancing selection maintains advantageous diversity in populations through various mechanisms. While extensively explored from a theoretical perspective, an empirical understanding of its prevalence and targets lags behind our knowledge of positive selection. Here we describe the Non-Central Deviation (NCD), a simple yet powerful statistic to detect long-term balancing selection (LTBS) that quantifies how close frequencies are to expectations under LTBS, and provides the basis for a neutrality test. NCD can be applied to a single locus or genomic data, and can be implemented considering only polymorphisms (NCD1) or also considering fixed differences with respect to an outgroup (NCD2) species. Incorporating fixed differences improves power, and NCD2 has higher power to detect LTBS in humans under different frequencies of the balanced allele(s) than other available methods. Applied to genome-wide data from African and European human populations, in both cases using chimpanzee as an outgroup, NCD2 shows that, albeit not prevalent, LTBS affects a sizable portion of the genome: about 0.6% of analyzed genomic windows and 0.8% of analyzed positions. Significant windows (p < 0.0001) contain 1.6% of SNPs in the genome, which disproportionally fall within exons and change protein sequence, but are not enriched in putatively regulatory sites. These windows overlap about 8% of the protein-coding genes, and these have larger number of transcripts than expected by chance even after controlling for gene length. Our catalog includes known targets of LTBS but a majority of them (90%) are novel. As expected, immune-related genes are among those with the strongest signatures, although most candidates are involved in other biological functions, suggesting that LTBS potentially influences diverse human phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new conceptual framework and a model-based interventional calculus to steer, manipulate, and reconstruct the dynamics and generating mechanisms of non-linear dynamical systems from partial and disordered observations based on the contributions of each of the systems, by exploiting first principles from the theory of computability and algorithmic information. This calculus entails finding and applying controlled interventions to an evolving object to estimate how its algorithmic information content is affected in terms of positive or negative shifts towards and away from randomness in connection to causation. The approach is an alternative to statistical approaches for inferring causal relationships and formulating theoretical expectations from perturbation analysis. We find that the algorithmic information landscape of a system runs parallel to its dynamic attractor landscape, affording an avenue for moving systems on one plane so they can be controlled on the other plane. Based on these methods, we advance tools for reprogramming a system that do not require full knowledge or access to the systems actual kinetic equations or to probability distributions. This new approach yields a suite of universal parameter-free algorithms of wide applicability, ranging from the discovery of causality, dimension reduction, feature selection, model generation, a maximal algorithmic-randomness principle and a systems (re)programmability index. We apply these methods to static (e.coli Transcription Factor network) and to evolving genetic regulatory networks (differentiating naive from Th17 cells, and the CellNet database). We highlight their ability to pinpoint key elements (genes) related to cell function and cell development, conforming to biological knowledge from experimentally validated data and the literature, and demonstrate how the method can reshape a systems dynamics in a controlled manner through algorithmic causal mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "In Bangladesh, the poultry industry is an economically and socially important sector, but it is persistently threatened by the effects of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza. Thus, identifying the optimal control policy in response to an emerging disease outbreak is a key challenge for policy-makers. To inform this aim, a common approach is to carry out simulation studies comparing plausible strategies, while accounting for known capacity restrictions. In this study we perform simulations of a previously developed H5N1 influenza transmission model framework, fitted to two separate historical outbreaks, to assess specific control objectives related to the burden or duration of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry farms in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh. In particular, we explore the optimal implementation of ring culling, ring vaccination and active surveillance measures when presuming disease transmission predominately occurs from premises-to-premises, versus a setting requiring the inclusion of external factors. Additionally, we determine the sensitivity of the management actions under consideration to differing levels of capacity constraints and outbreaks with disparate transmission dynamics. While we find that reactive culling and vaccination policies should pay close attention to these factors to ensure intervention targeting is optimised, across multiple settings the top performing control action amongst those under consideration were targeted proactive surveillance schemes. Our findings may advise the type of control measure, plus its intensity, that could potentially be applied in the event of a developing outbreak of H5N1 amongst originally H5N1 virus-free commercially-reared poultry in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy will affect nearly 3% of people at some point during their lifetime. Previous copy number variants (CNVs) studies of epilepsy have used array-based technology and were restricted to the detection of large or exonic events. In contrast, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to more comprehensively profile CNVs but existing analytic methods suffer from limited accuracy. We show that this is in part due to the non-uniformity of read coverage, even after intra-sample normalization. To improve on this, we developed PopSV, an algorithm that uses multiple samples to control for technical variation and enables the robust detection of CNVs. Using WGS and PopSV, we performed a comprehensive characterization of CNVs in 198 individuals affected with epilepsy and 301 controls. For both large and small variants, we found an enrichment of rare exonic events in epilepsy patients, especially in genes with predicted loss-of-function intolerance. Notably, this genome-wide survey also revealed an enrichment of rare non-coding CNVs near previously known epilepsy genes. This enrichment was strongest for non-coding CNVs located within 100 Kbp of an epilepsy gene and in regions associated with changes in the gene expression, such as expression QTLs or DNase I hypersensitive sites. Finally, we report on 21 potentially damaging events that could be associated with known or new candidate epilepsy genes. Our results suggest that comprehensive sequence-based profiling of CNVs could help explain a larger fraction of epilepsy cases.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEpilepsy is a common neurological disorder affecting around 3% of the population. In some cases, epilepsy is caused by brain trauma or other brain anomalies but there are often no clear causes. Genetic factors have been associated with epilepsy in the past such as rare genetic variations found by linkage studies as well as common genetic variations found by genome-wide association studies and large copy-number variants. We sequenced the genome of[~] 200 epilepsy patients and[~] 300 healthy controls and compared the distribution of deletion (loss of a copy) and duplication (additional copy) of genomic regions. Thanks to the sequencing technology and a new method that takes advantage of the large sample size, we could compare the distribution of small copy- number variants between epilepsy patients and controls. Overall, we found that small variants are also associated with epilepsy. Indeed, the genome of epilepsy patients had more exonic copy- number variants, especially when rare or affecting genes with predicted loss-of-function intolerance. Focusing on regions around genes that have been previously associated with epilepsy, we also found more non-coding variants in epilepsy patients, especially deletions or variants in regulatory regions. Finally, we provide a list of 21 regions in which we found likely pathogenic variants.",

    "abstract": "The nature of artificial vision with a retinal prosthesis, and the degree to which the brain can adapt to the unnatural input from such a device, are poorly understood. Therefore, the development of current and future devices may be aided by theory and simulations that help to infer and understand what prosthesis patients see. A biologically-informed, extensible computational framework is presented here to predict visual perception and the potential effect of learning with a subretinal prosthesis. The framework relies on optimal linear reconstruction of the stimulus from retinal responses to infer the visual information available to the patient. A simulation of the physiological optics of the eye and light responses of the major retinal neurons was used to calculate the optimal linear transformation for reconstructing natural images from retinal activity. The result was then used to reconstruct the visual stimulus during the artificial activation expected from a subretinal prosthesis in a degenerated retina, as a proxy for inferred visual perception. Several simple observations reveal the potential utility of such a simulation framework. The inferred perception obtained with prosthesis activation was substantially degraded compared to the inferred perception obtained with normal retinal responses, as expected given the limited resolution and lack of cell type specificity of the prosthesis. Consistent with clinical findings and the importance of cell type specificity, reconstruction using only ON cells, and not OFF cells, was substantially more accurate. Finally, when reconstruction was re-optimized for prosthesis stimulation, simulating the greatest potential for learning by the patient, the accuracy of inferred perception was much closer to that of healthy vision. The reconstruction approach thus provides a more complete method for exploring the potential for treating blindness with retinal prostheses than has been available previously. It may also be useful for interpreting patient data in clinical trials, and for improving prosthesis design.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a rapid, cost-effective, non-invasive biodiversity monitoring tool which utilises DNA left behind in the environment by organisms for species detection. The method is used as a species specific survey tool for rare or invasive species across a broad range of ecosystems. Recently, eDNA and  metabarcoding have been combined to describe whole communities rather than focusing on single target species. However, whether metabarcoding is as sensitive as targeted approaches for rare species detection remains to be evaluated. The great crested newt Triturus cristatus is a flagship pond species of international conservation concern and the first UK species to be routinely monitored using eDNA. We evaluate whether eDNA metabarcoding has comparable sensitivity to targeted real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for T. cristatus detection. Extracted eDNA samples (N = 532) were screened for T. cristatus by qPCR and analysed for all vertebrate species using High-Throughput Sequencing technology. With qPCR and a detection threshold of 1/12 positive qPCR replicates, newts were detected in 50% of ponds. Detection decreased to 32% when the threshold was increased to 4/12 positive qPCR replicates. With metabarcoding, newts were detected in 34% of ponds without a detection threshold, and in 28% of ponds when a threshold (0.028%) was applied. Therefore, qPCR provided greater detection than metabarcoding but metabarcoding detection with no threshold was equivalent to qPCR with a stringent detection threshold. The proportion of T. cristatus sequences in each sample was positively associated with the number of positive qPCR replicates (qPCR score) suggesting eDNA metabarcoding may be indicative of eDNA concentration. eDNA metabarcoding holds enormous potential for holistic biodiversity assessment and routine freshwater monitoring. We advocate this community approach to freshwater monitoring to guide management and conservation, whereby entire communities can be initially surveyed to best inform use of funding and time for species-specific surveys.",

In the present study we developed a variant of the classical Kanizsa illusory triangle to investigate whether voluntary attention modulates perceptual filling-in. Our figure consists of \\\"pacmen\\\" positioned at the tips of an illusory 6-point star and alternating in polarity such that two illusory triangles are implied to compete with one another within the figure. On each trial, observers were cued to attend to only one triangle, and then compared its lightness with a matching texture-defined triangle. We found that perceived lightness of the illusory shape depended on the polarity of pacmen framing the attended triangle, although the magnitude of this effect was weaker than when all inducers were of the same polarity. Our findings thus reveal that voluntary attention can influence lightness filling-in, and provide important data linking neurophysiological effects to phenomenology.",

    "abstract": "Pre-mRNA splicing is accomplished by the spliceosome, a megadalton complex that assembles de novo on each intron. Because spliceosome assembly and catalysis occur co-transcriptionally, we hypothesized that introns are removed in the order of their transcription in genomes dominated by constitutive splicing. Remarkably little is known about splicing order and the regulatory potential of nascent transcript remodeling by splicing, due to the limitations of existing methods that focus on analysis of mature splicing products (mRNAs) rather than substrates and intermediates. Here, we overcome this obstacle through long-read RNA sequencing of nascent, multi-intron transcripts in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Most multi-intron transcripts were fully spliced, consistent with rapid co-transcriptional splicing. However, an unexpectedly high proportion of transcripts were either fully spliced or fully unspliced, suggesting that splicing of any given intron is dependent on the splicing status of other introns in the transcript. Supporting this, mild inhibition of splicing by a temperature-sensitive mutation in Prp2, the homolog of vertebrate U2AF65, increased the frequency of fully unspliced transcripts. Importantly, fully unspliced transcripts displayed transcriptional read-through at the polyA site and were degraded co-transcriptionally by the nuclear exosome. Finally, we show that cellular mRNA levels were reduced in genes with a high number of unspliced nascent transcripts during caffeine treatment, showing regulatory significance of co-transcriptional splicing. Therefore, overall splicing of individual nascent transcripts, 3 end formation, and mRNA half-life depend on the splicing status of neighboring introns, suggesting crosstalk among spliceosomes and the polyA cleavage machinery during transcription elongation.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection plays a variety of roles in hybridization, speciation and admixture. Most research has focused on two extreme cases: crosses between closely-related inbred lines, where hybrids are fitter than their parents, or crosses between effectively isolated species, where hybrids suffer severe breakdown. Many natural populations must fall into intermediate regimes, with multiple types of gene interaction, but these are more difficult to study. Here, we develop a simple fitness landscape model, and show that it naturally interpolates between previous modeling approaches, involving mildly deleterious recessives, or discrete hybrid incompatibilities. The model yields several new predictions, which we test with genomic data from Mytilus mussels, and published data from plants (Zea, Populus and Senecio) and animals (Mus, Teleogryllus and Drosophila). The predictions are generally supported, and the model explains surprising empirical patterns that have been observed in both extreme regimes. Our approach enables novel and complementary uses of genome-wide datasets, which do not depend on identifying outlier loci, or \\\"speciation genes\\\" with anomalous effects. Given its simplicity and flexibility, and its predictive successes with a wide range of data, the approach should be readily extendable to other outstanding questions in the study of hybridization.",

    "abstract": "The transition of gonocytes to spermatogonia and subsequent differentiation provide the foundation of spermatogenesis. However, systematic understanding on the cellular and molecular basis of this process is still limited, mainly impeded by the asynchrony in development and the lack of stage-specific markers. Using single-cell RNA sequencing on Oct4-GFP+/KIT- cells isolated from PND5.5 mice, we dissected the cellular heterogeneity and established molecular regulations. We demonstrated that gonocyte-spermatogonial transition was characterized by gene expression change related to apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and regulation of migration processes. Pseudotime analysis reconstructed developmental dynamics of the spermatogonial populations and unraveled sequential cellular and molecular transitions. We also identified CD87 as a neonatal stem cell marker which are potentially involved in the intial establishment of SSC pool. Lastly, we uncovered an unexpected subpopulation of spermatogonia primed to differentiation within the undifferentiated compartment, which is characterized by the lack of self-renewal genes and enhanced Oct4 expression and retinoic acid signaling response. Our study thus provides a novel understanding of cellular and molecular changes during spermatogonial establishment.",

    "abstract": "Detecting associations between genomic changes and phenotypic differences is fundamental to understanding how phenotypes evolved. By systematically screening for parallel amino acid substitutions, we detected known as well as novel cases (Strc, Tecta, Cabp2) of parallelism between echolocating bats and toothed whales in proteins that could contribute to high frequency hearing adaptations. Interestingly, our screen also showed that echolocating mammals exhibit an unusually high number of parallel substitutions in fast-twitch muscle fiber proteins. Both bats and dolphins produce an extremely rapid call rate when homing in on their prey, which was shown in bats to be powered by specialized superfast muscles. We show that these genes with parallel substitutions (Casq1, Atp2a1, Myh2, Myl1) are expressed in the superfast sound-producing muscle of bats. Furthermore, we found that the calcium storage protein calsequestrin 1 of bats and dolphins functionally converged in its ability to form calcium-sequestering polymers at lower calcium concentrations, which may contribute to rapid calcium transients required for superfast muscle physiology. The proteins that our genomic screen detected could be involved in the convergent evolution of vocalization in echolocating mammals by potentially contributing to both rapid Ca2+ transients and increased shortening velocities in superfast muscles.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

RNA granules have been proposed to form by liquid-liquid phase separation, a thermodynamic process that partitions molecules between dilute and condensed liquid phases 1. P granules are archetypal RNA granules in C. elegans that display liquid-like behaviors 2. Here we describe in vivo and ex vivo approaches to analyze the material properties of P granules. We find that the liquid phase of P granules is stabilized by a molecularly-distinct, enveloping shell that is intrinsically non-dynamic. Consistent with a gel phase, the shell is resistant to dilution, high salt, and aliphatic alcohols, and dissolves in SDS. Solidification of RNA granules has been linked to neuronal degeneration 3. Our findings suggest that gel-like polymers are essential components of RNA granules that help stabilize liquid phases in the cellular environment.",

    "abstract": "To understand tissue architecture it is necessary to understand both which cell types are present and their physical relationships to one another. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) has made significant progress towards the unbiased and systematic characterization of cell populations within a tissue by studying hundreds and thousands of cells in a single experiment. However, the characterization of the spatial organization of individual cells within a tissue has been more elusive. The recently introduced  spatial transcriptomics method (ST) reveals the spatial pattern of gene expression within a tissue section at a resolution of a thousand 100 m spots across the tissue, each capturing the transcriptomes of [~]10-20 cells. Here, we present an approach for the integration of scRNA-Seq and ST data generated from the same sample of pancreatic cancer tissue. Using markers for cell types identified by scRNA-Seq, we robustly deconvolved the cell type composition of each ST spot to generate a spatial atlas of cell proportions across the tissue. Studying this atlas, we found that distinct spatial localizations accompany each of the cell populations that we identified. Our results provide a framework for creating a tumor atlas by mapping single-cell populations to their spatial region, as well as the inference of cell architecture in any tissue.",

    "abstract": "Today, Mg2+ is an essential cofactor with diverse structural and functional roles in lifes oldest macromolecular machine, the translation system. We tested whether ancient Earth conditions (low O2, high Fe2+, high Mn2+) can revert the ribosome to a functional ancestral state. First, SHAPE (Selective 2 Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension) was used to compare the effect of Mg2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ on the tertiary structure of rRNA. Then, we used in vitro translation reactions to test whether Fe2+ or Mn2+ could mediate protein production, and quantified ribosomal metal content. We found that: (i) Mg2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ had strikingly similar effects on rRNA folding; (ii) Fe2+ and Mn2+ can replace Mg2+ as the dominant divalent cation during translation of mRNA to functional protein; (iii) Fe and Mn associate extensively with the ribosome. Given that the translation system originated and matured when Fe2+ and Mn2+ were abundant, these findings suggest that Fe2+ and Mn2+ played a role in early ribosomal evolution.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCERibosomes are found in every living organism where they are responsible for the translation of messenger RNA into protein. The ribosomes centrality to cell function is underscored by its evolutionary conservation; the core structure has changed little since its inception ~4 billion years ago when ecosystems were anoxic and metal-rich. The ribosome is a model system for the study of bioinorganic chemistry, owing to the many highly coordinated divalent metal cations that are essential to its function. We studied the structure, function, and cation content of the ribosome under early Earth conditions (low O2, high Fe2+, high Mn2+). Our results expand the roles of Fe2+ and Mn2+ in ancient and extant biochemistry as cofactors for ribosomal structure and function.",

Proper risk analysis and the development of effective food safety strategies critically depend on the knowledge of the growth characteristics of L. monocytogenes on the product in question. Ready-to-eat (RTE) salads present a challenge in this context due to the absence of a heat treatment step before consumption and the interaction of pathogens with the plant microbial microbiota. This study provides challenge-test based data of the growth characteristics of L. monocytogenes on twelve RTE salads. The food matrix, storage time and storage temperature were factors with a significant impact on the growth of L. monocytogenes. While most tested salads permitted a significant increase of L. monocytogenes in at least one of the tested conditions, no growth was observed on celeriac, carrot and corn salad products. There was a considerable increase in growth at 8 {degrees}C compared to 5 {degrees}C. Our data indicate that the reduction of the storage temperature at retail level to 5 {degrees}C and product shelf life could help mitigate the risk of L. monocytogenes in RTE salads.",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive evidence that biodiversity promotes plant community productivity, progress towards understanding the mechanistic basis of this effect remains slow, impeding the development of predictive ecological theory and agricultural applications. Here, we analysed non-additive interactions between genetically divergent Arabidopsis accessions in experimental plant communities. By combining methods from ecology and genetics, we identified a major effect locus at which allelic differences between individuals increases above-ground productivity of communities. In experiments with near-isogenic lines, we show that this diversity effect acts independently of other genomic regions and can be resolved to a single region representing less than 0.3% of the genome. Using plant-soil-feedback experiments, we also demonstrate that allelic diversity causes genotype-specific soil legacy responses in a consecutive growing period, even after the original community has disappeared. Our work thus suggests that positive diversity effects can be linked to single Mendelian factors, and that a range of complex community properties can have a simple cause. This may pave the way to a better understanding of diversity effects, and to novel breeding strategies, focussing on phenotypic properties that manifest themselves beyond isolated individuals, i.e. at a higher level of biological organisation.",

However, without proper parameterization, these methods are not suitable for ancient DNA. Quantifying somewhat dissimilar sequences by alignment methods is problematic, due to the need of fine-tuned thresholds, considering relaxed edit distances and the consequent increase of computational cost. Additionally, the choice of the thresholds poses the problem of how to quantify similarity without producing overestimated measures. We propose FALCON-meta, a compression-based method to infer metagenomic composition of next-generation sequencing samples. This unsupervised alignment-free method runs efficiently on FASTQ samples. FALCON-meta quickly learns how to give importance to the models that cooperate to predict similarity, incorporating parallelism and flexibility for multiple hardware characteristics. It shows substantial identification capabilities in ancient DNA without overestimation.

The full spectra of psychotic experience domains, both in terms of their severity and type (positive, cognitive, and negative), were assessed using self- and parent-ratings in three European community samples aged 15-19 years (Final N incl. siblings = 6,297-10,098). A mega-genome-wide association study (mega-GWAS) for each psychotic experience domain was performed. SNP-heritability of each psychotic experience domain was estimated using genomic-relatedness-based restricted maximum-likelihood (GREML) and linkage disequilibrium-(LD-) score regression. Genetic overlap between specific psychotic experience domains and schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression was assessed using polygenic risk scoring (PRS) and LD-score regression. GREML returned SNP-heritability estimates of 3-9% for psychotic experience trait domains, with higher estimates for less skewed traits (Anhedonia, Cognitive Disorganization) than for more skewed traits (Paranoia and Hallucinations, Parent-rated Negative Symptoms). Mega-GWAS analysis identified one genome-wide significant association for Anhedonia within IDO2 but which did not replicate in an independent sample. PRS analysis revealed that the schizophrenia PRS significantly predicted all adolescent psychotic experience trait domains (Paranoia and Hallucinations only in non-zero scorers). The major depression PRS significantly predicted Anhedonia and Parent-rated Negative Symptoms in adolescence. Psychotic experiences during adolescence in the community show additive genetic effects and partly share genetic influences with clinically-recognized psychiatric disorders, specifically schizophrenia and major depression.",

Unfortunately, its polymeric structure has hampered the identification of immune receptors directly binding chitin and signaling immune activation and inflammation, because purity, molecular structure and molarity are not well definable for a polymer typically extracted from biomass. Therefore, by using defined chitin (N-acetyl-glucosamine) oligomers, we identified six subunit long chitin chains as the smallest immunologically active motif and the innate immune receptor Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 as the primary fungal chitin receptor on human and murine immune cells. Chitin oligomers directly bound TLR2 with nanomolar affinity and showed both overlapping and distinct signaling outcomes compared to known mycobacterial TLR2 ligands. Conversely, chitin oligomers shorter than 6 subunits were inactive or showed antagonistic effects on chitin/TLR2-mediated signaling, hinting to a size-dependent sensing/activation system unexpectedly conserved in plants and humans. Since blocking the chitin-TLR2 interaction effectively prevented chitin-mediated inflammation in vitro and in vivo, our study highlights the chitin TLR2 interaction as a potential target for developing novel therapies in chitin-related pathologies and fungal disease.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWJointly developing a comprehensive tree of life from living and fossil taxa has long been a fundamental goal in evolutionary biology. One major challenge has stemmed from difficulties in merging evidence from extant and extinct organisms. While these efforts have resulted in varying stages of synthesis, they have been hindered by their dependence on qualitative descriptions of morphology. Though rarely applied to phylogenetic inference, traditional and geometric morphometric data can improve these issues by generating more rigorous ways to quantify variation in morphological structures. They may also facilitate the rapid and objective aggregation of large morphological datasets. I describe a new Bayesian method that leverages quantitative trait data to reconstruct the positions of fossil taxa on fixed reference trees composed of extant taxa. Unlike most formulations of phylogenetic Brownian motion models, this method expresses branch lengths in units of morphological disparity, suggesting a new framework through which to construct Bayesian node calibration priors for molecular dating and explore comparative patterns in morphological disparity. I am hopeful that the approach described here will help to facilitate a deeper integration of neo- and paleontological data to move morphological phylogenetics further into the genomic era.",

    "abstract": "It is an uninformative truism to state that the brain operates at multiple spatial and temporal scales, each with each own set of emergent phenomena. More worthy of attention is the point that our current understanding of it cannot clearly indicate which of these phenomenological scales are the significant contributors to the brains function and primary output (i.e. behaviour). Apart from the sheer complexity of the problem, a major contributing factor to this state of affairs is the lack of instrumentation that can simultaneously address these multiple scales without causing function altering damages to the underlying tissue. One important facet of this problem is that standard neural recording devices normally require one output connection per electrode. This limits the number of electrodes that can fit along the thin shafts of implantable probes generating a limiting balance between density and spread. Sharing a single output connection between multiple electrodes relaxes this constraint and permits designs of ultra-high density probes.\n\nHere we report the design and in-vivo validation of such a device, a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) scanning probe with 1344 electrodes; the outcome of the European research project NeuroSeeker. We show that this design targets both local and global spatial scales by allowing the simultaneous recording of more than 1000 neurons spanning 7 functional regions with a single shaft. The neurons show similar recording longevity and signal to noise ratio to passive probes of comparable size and no adverse effects in awake or anesthetized animals. Addressing the data management of this device we also present novel visualization and monitoring methods. Using the probe with freely moving animals we show how accessing a number of cortical and subcortical brain regions offers a novel perspective on how the brain operates around salient behavioural events. Finally, we compare this probe with lower density, non CMOS designs (which have to adhere to the one electrode per output line rule). We show that an increase in density results in capturing neural firing patterns, undetectable by lower density devices, which correlate to self-similar structures inherent in complex naturalistic behaviour.\n\nTo help design electrode configurations for future, even higher density, CMOS probes, recordings from many different brain regions were obtained with an ultra-dense passive probe.",

In many cases, the observed particles are indistinguishable, leading to unavoidable uncertainty about nearby particles identities. Exact Bayesian inference is intractable in this setting, and previous approximate Bayesian methods scale poorly. Non-Bayesian approaches that output a single \\\"best\\\" estimate of the particle tracks (thus discarding important uncertainty information) are therefore dominant in practice. Here we propose a flexible and scalable amortized approach for Bayesian inference on this task. We introduce a novel neural network method to approximate the (intractable) filter-backward-sample-forward algorithm for Bayesian inference in this setting. By varying the simulated training data for the network, we can perform inference on a wide variety of data types. This approach is therefore highly flexible and improves on the state of the art in terms of accuracy; provides uncertainty estimates about the particle locations and identities; and has a test run-time that scales linearly as a function of the data length and number of particles, thus enabling Bayesian inference in arbitrarily large particle tracking datasets.",

    "abstract": "In Metazoans, transcription of most genes is driven through the use of multiple alternative promoters. Although the precise spatio-temporal regulation of alternative promoters is important for proper gene expression, the mechanism that mediates their differential utilization remains unclear. Here, we investigate how the two alternative promoters (P1, P2) that drive MYC expression are regulated. We find that P1 and P2 can be differentially regulated across cell-types, and that their selective usage is largely mediated by distal regulatory sequences. Moreover, we show that in the colon carcinoma cell line HCT-116, Wnt-responsive enhancers preferentially upregulate transcription from the P1 promoter using both transgenic reporter assays and in the context of the endogenous Myc locus upon Wnt induction. In addition, multiple enhancer deletions using CRISPR/Cas9 corroborate the regulatory specificity of P1. Finally, we show that preferential activation between Wnt-responsive enhancers and the P1 promoter is influenced by distinct core promoter elements present in the two MYC promoters. Taken together, our results provide new insights into how enhancers can specifically target alternative promoters and suggest that formation of these selective interactions could allow more diverse combinatorial regulation of transcription initiation.",

    "abstract": "Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a heritable trait with two potential sources of heritability (h2): inherited variation in non-telomeric regions (e.g., SNPs that influence telomere maintenance) and variability in the lengths of telomeres in gametes that produce offspring zygotes (i.e., \\\"direct\\\" inheritance). Prior studies of LTL h2 have not attempted to disentangle these two sources. Here, we use a novel approach for detecting the direct inheritance of telomeres by studying the association between identity-by-descent (IBD) sharing at chromosome ends and phenotypic similarity in LTL. We measured genome-wide SNPs and LTL for a sample of 5,069 Bangladeshi adults with substantial relatedness. For each of the 7,254 relative pairs identified, we used SNPs near the telomeres to estimate the number of chromosome ends shared IBD, a proxy for the number of telomeres shared IBD (Tshared). We then estimated the association between Tshared and the squared pairwise difference in LTL (({Delta}LTL)2) within various classes of relatives (siblings, avuncular, cousins, and distant), adjusting for overall genetic relatedness ({phi}). The association between Tshared and ({Delta}LTL)2 was inverse among all relative pair types. In a meta-analysis including all relative pairs ({phi} >0.05), the association between Tshared and ({Delta}LTL)2 (P=0.002) was stronger than the association between {phi} and ({Delta}LTL)2 (P=0.45). Our results provide strong evidence that telomere length (TL) in parental germ cells impacts TL in offspring cells and contributes to LTL h2 despite telomere \\\"reprogramming\\\" during embryonic development. Applying our method to larger studies will enable robust estimation of LTL h2 attributable to direction transmission.",

    "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been the prime model to study the assembly and functionality of eukaryotic ribosomes. Within that vast landscape, the specific problem of mutagenizing all 150 nuclear rRNA genes was bypassed using strains whose chromosomal copies had been deleted and substituted by plasmid-borne rDNA. Work with these strains has produced important insights, but nucleolar structure is altered and such yeast-specific approaches are elaborate and not transferable to most other eukaryotes. We describe here a simple CRISPR-Cas9 based method to place targeted mutations in all 150 chromosomal rDNA repeats in yeast. The procedure per se is not expected to alter the nucleolus and is potentially applicable also to other eukaryotes. Yeast was transformed with a plasmid bearing the genes for Cas9 and for the guide RNA, engineered to target a site in the SSU region. Our mutagenesis plan included insertion of a spliceosomal intron in the normally intronless yeast nuclear rDNA. Despite the potential lethality of cutting all 150 rDNA repeats at the same time, yeast survived the Cas9 attack through inactivation of the cut sites either by point mutations or by inserting the intron, which was spliced out correctly from the rRNA transcript. In each mutant strain the same mutation was present in all rDNA repeats and was stably inherited even after removal of the Cas9 plasmid.",

A connectome-wide analysis of brain connectivity examined how each individual brain voxels connectivity correlated with emotional intelligence using multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR).\\n\\nResultsWe identified a region in the left superior parietal lobule (SPL) where individual network topology predicted emotional intelligence. Specifically, the association of this region with the Default Mode Network predicted higher emotional intelligence and association with the Dorsal Attention Network predicted lower emotional intelligence. This correlation was observed in both schizophrenia and healthy comparison participants.\\n\\nConclusionPrevious studies have demonstrated individual variance in brain network topology but the cognitive or behavioral relevance of these differences was undetermined. We observe that the left SPL, a region of high individual variance at the cytoarchitectonic level, also demonstrates individual variance in its association with large scale brain networks and that network topology predicts emotional intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Computational models in neuroscience typically contain many parameters that are poorly constrained by experimental data. Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis provide rigorous procedures to quantify how the model output depends on this parameter uncertainty. Unfortunately, the application of such methods is not yet standard within the field of neuroscience.\\n\\nHere we present Uncertainpy, an open-source Python toolbox, tailored to perform uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of neuroscience models. Uncertainpy aims to make it easy and quick to get started with uncertainty analysis, without any need for detailed prior knowledge. The toolbox allows uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis to be performed on already existing models without needing to modify the model equations or model implementation. Uncertainpy bases its analysis on polynomial chaos expansions, which are more efficient than the more standard Monte-Carlo based approaches.\\n\\nUncertainpy is tailored for neuroscience applications by its built-in capability for calculating characteristic features in the model output. The toolbox does not merely perform a point-to- point comparison of the \\\"raw\\\" model output (e.g. membrane voltage traces), but can also calculate the uncertainty and sensitivity of salient model response features such as spike timing, action potential width, mean interspike interval, and other features relevant for various neural and neural network models. Uncertainpy comes with several common models and features built in, and including custom models and new features is easy.\\n\\nThe aim of the current paper is to present Uncertainpy for the neuroscience community in a user- oriented manner. To demonstrate its broad applicability, we perform an uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis on three case studies relevant for neuroscience: the original Hodgkin-Huxley point-neuron model for action potential generation, a multi-compartmental model of a thalamic interneuron implemented in the NEURON simulator, and a sparsely connected recurrent network model implemented in the NEST simulator.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTA major challenge in computational neuroscience is to specify the often large number of parameters that define the neuron and neural network models. Many of these parameters have an inherent variability, and some may even be actively regulated and change with time. It is important to know how the uncertainty in model parameters affects the model predictions. To address this need we here present Uncertainpy, an open-source Python toolbox tailored to perform uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of neuroscience models.",

We have focused on human perilipin 4 (Plin4), which contains an AH that is exceptional in terms of length and repetitiveness. Using model cellular systems, we show that AH length, hydrophobicity, and charge are important for AH targeting to LDs and that these properties can compensate for one another, albeit at a loss of targeting specificity. Using synthetic lipids, we show that purified Plin4 AH binds poorly to lipid bilayers but strongly interacts with pure triglycerides, acting as a coat and forming small oil droplets. Because Plin4 overexpression alleviates LD instability under conditions where their coverage by phospholipids is limiting, we propose that the Plin4 AH replaces the LD lipid monolayer, for example during LD growth.",

The method, called RELACS (Restriction Enzyme-based Labeling of Chromatin in Situ), employs barcoding of chromatin within intact nuclei extracted from different sources (e.g. tissues, treatments, time points). Barcoded nuclei are pooled and processed within the same ChIP, for maximal comparability and significant workload reduction. The choice of user-friendly, straightforward, enzymatic steps for chromatin fragmentation and barcoding makes RELACS particularly suitable for implementation large-scale clinical studies and scarce samples.

We show that relative differences of protein abundances of metabolic enzymes obtained by mass spectrometry can be used to scale maximal enzyme capacities. Model simulations predicted tumor - specific alterations of various components of the CCM, a selected number of which were subsequently verified by in vitro and in vivo experiments.

    "abstract": "Fairness judgment is a fundamental aspect of human cooperation. By carefully balancing the payoffs and efforts with cooperating partner (s) we could either avoid or punish cheaters and stably maintain cooperation. Recent studies investigating the origin of this fairness sentiment have demonstrated that this psychological trait is not unique to humans, but also can be observed in other group-living primates, such as chimpanzees and capuchins, suggesting a convergent evolution of a sense of fairness, with cooperative social life being the selective pressure for it. The current study was designed to test this hypothesis by directly comparing the response to the outcome inequity in two of our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and orangutans, having different social systems, i.e. solitary and patrilocal multi-male multi-female groups. Unlike other inequity experiments, we used a prosocial choice apparatus with different reward distributions (advantageous / disadvantageous) to give subjects an active role of not-sharing foods if they considered it unfair. In addition to the choice, we also recorded the behavioral responses of the apes to the inequity. Throughout the experiments aversive emotional responses toward the disadvantageous inequity were only found in chimpanzees, but not in orangutans, supporting the convergent (or domain-specific) evolution of a sense of fairness. However, this aversion to the inequity did not lead the chimpanzees to actually make selfish choices, indirectly supporting the previous findings that chimpanzees employ a partner choice strategy rather than a punishment for fair cooperation. We also found that hierarchy seems to play an important role in the expression of aversion to inequity and prosocial tendency in chimpanzees.",

In one model, we allowed the configuration of the maze to vary to best explain the pointing data; in a second model we also allowed the local reference frame to be rotated through 90, 180 or 270 degrees.

For a distance matrix with missing distances, the least-squares approach is often used for imputing the missing values. Here I develop a method, similar to the expectation-maximization algorithm, to impute multiple missing distance in a distance matrix. I show that, for inferring the best tree and missing distances, the minimum evolution criterion is not as desirable as the least-squares criterion. I also discuss the problem involving cases where the missing values cannot be uniquely determined, e.g., when a missing distance involve two sister taxa. The new method has the advantage over the existing one in that it does not assume a molecular clock.

    "abstract": "For over a century, temperature compensation (maintenance of biological rates with changing temperatures) has remained controversial. An alternative idea, that fitness is greater at higher temperatures (the thermodynamic effect), has gained increasing traction, and is being used to understand large-scale biodiversity responses to environmental change. Yet evidence in favour of each of these contrasting hypotheses continues to emerge. In consequence, the fundamental nature of organismal thermal responses and its implications remain unresolved. Here we investigate these ideas explicitly using a global dataset of 619 observations of four categories of organismal performance, spanning 14 phyla and 403 species. In agreement with both hypotheses, we show a positive relationship between the temperature of maximal performance rate (Topt) and environmental temperature (Tenv) for all traits. Next we demonstrate that relationships between Tenv and the temperature of maximal performance rate (Umax) are rarely significant and positive, as expected if a thermodynamic effect predominates. By contrast, a positive relationship between Topt and Umax is always present, but markedly weaker than theoretically predicted. These outcomes demonstrate that while some form of thermodynamic effect exists, ample scope is present for biochemical and physiological adaptation to thermal environments in the form of temperature compensation.",

Despite recent major advances in the understanding of complex food web dynamics, food web models have so far generally ignored nutrient cycling. However, nutrient cycling is expected to strongly impact food web stability and functioning. To make up for this gap, we built an allometric and size structured food web model including nutrient cycling. By releasing mineral nutrients, recycling increases the availability of limiting resources for primary producers and links each trophic level to the bottom of food webs. We found that nutrient cycling can provide a significant part of the total nutrient supply of the food web, leading to a strong enrichment effect that promotes species persistence in nutrient poor ecosystems but leads to a paradox of enrichment at high nutrient inputs. The presence of recycling loops linking each trophic level to the basal resources weakly affects species biomass temporal variability in the food web. Recycling loops tend to slightly dampen the destabilising effect of nutrient enrichment on consumer temporal variability while they have opposite effects for primary producers. By considering nutrient cycling, this new model improves our understanding of the response of food webs to nutrient availability and opens perspectives to better link studies on food web dynamics and ecosystem functioning.",

    "abstract": "Understanding ecosystem stability is one of the greatest challenges of ecology. Over several decades, it has been shown that allometric scaling of biological rates and feeding interactions provide stability to complex food web models. Moreover, introducing adaptive responses of organisms to environmental changes (e.g. like adaptive foraging that enables organisms to adapt their diets depending on resources abundance) improved species per-sistence in food webs. Here, we introduce the concept of metabolic adjustment, i.e. the ability of species to slow down their metabolic rates when facing starvation and to increase it in time of plenty. We study the reactions of such a model to nutrient enrichment and the adjustment speed of metabolic rates. We found that increasing nutrient enrichment leads to a paradox of enrichment (increase in biomasses and oscillation amplitudes and ultimately extinction of species) but metabolic adjustment stabilises the system by dampening the oscillations. Metabolic adjustment also increases the average biomass of the top predator in a tri-trophic food chain. In complex food webs, metabolic adjustment has a stabilising effect as it promotes species survival by creating a large diversity of metabolic rates. However, this stabilising effect is mitigated in enriched ecosystems. Phenotypic plasticity of organisms must be considered in food web models to better understand the response of organisms to their environment. As metabolic rate is central in describing biological rates, we must pay attention to its variations to fully understand the population dynamics of natural communities.",

While FAW larvae are considered polyphagous, differences in diet preference have been described between two genetic variants: the corn strain (sf-C) and the rice strain (sf-R). These two strains are sometimes considered as distinct species, raising the hypothesis that ost plant specialization might have driven their divergence. To test this hypothesis, we irst performed controlled reciprocal transplant (RT) experiments to address the impact of plant diet on several traits linked to the fitness of the sf-C and sf-R strains. The phenotypical data suggest that sf-C is specialized to corn. We then used RNA-Se to identify constitutive transcriptional differences between strains, regardless of diet, in laboratory as well as in natural populations. We found that variations in mitochon rial transcription levels are among the most substantial and consistent differences between the two strains. Since mitochondrial genotypes also vary between the strains, we believe the mitochondria may have a significant role in driving strain divergence.",

    "abstract": "Small bacterial and archaeal genomes provide insights into the minimal requirements for life1 and seem to be widespread on the microbial phylogenetic tree2. We know that evolutionary processes, mainly selection and drift, can result in microbial genome reduction 3,4. However, we do not know the precise environmental pressures that constrain genome size in free-living microorganisms. A study including isolates 5 has shown that bacteria with high optimum growth temperatures, including thermophiles, often have small genomes 6. It is unclear how well this relationship may extend generally to microorganisms in nature 7,8, and in particular to those microbes inhabiting complex and highly variable environments like soil 3,6,9. To understand the genomic traits of thermally-adapted microorganisms, here we investigated bacterial and archaeal metagenomes from a 45{degrees}C gradient of temperate-to-thermal soils overlying the ongoing Centralia, Pennsylvania (USA) coal seam fire. There was a strong relationship between average genome size and temperature: hot soils had small genomes relative to ambient soils (Pearsons r = -0.910, p < 0.001). There was also an inverse relationship between soil temperature and cell size (Pearsons r = -0.65, p = 0.021), providing evidence that cell and genome size in the wild are together constrained by temperature. Notably, hot soils had different community structures than ambient soils, implicating ecological selection for thermo-tolerant cells that had small genomes, rather than contemporary genome streamlining within the local populations. Hot soils notably lacked genes for described two-component regulatory systems and antimicrobial production and resistance. Our work provides field evidence for the inverse relationship between microbial genome size and temperature requirements in a diverse, free-living community over a wide range of temperatures that support microbial life. Our findings demonstrate that ecological selection for thermophiles and thermo-tolerant microorganisms can result in smaller average genome sizes in situ, possibly because they have small genomes reminiscent of a more ancestral state.",

In the current study, we identified a positive relationship between smartphone screen time (e.g. phone unlock duration) and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the subgenual cingulate cortex (sgCC), a brain region implicated in depression and antidepressant treatment response, and regions of the ventromedial/orbitofrontal cortex, such that increased phone usage was related to stronger connectivity between these regions. We then used this cluster to constrain subsequent analyses looking at depressive symptoms in the same cohort and observed partial replication in a separate cohort. We believe the data and analyses presented here provide relatively simplistic initial analyses which replicate and provide a first step in combining functional brain activity and smartphone usage patterns to better understand issues related to mental health.

    "abstract": "Abiotic stresses in plants are often transient and the recovery phase following stress removal is critical. Flooding, a major abiotic stress that negatively impacts plant biodiversity and agriculture, is a sequential stress where tolerance is strongly dependent on viability underwater and during the postflooding period. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana accessions (Bay-0 and Lp2-6), different rates of submergence recovery correlate with submergence tolerance and fecundity. A genome-wide assessment of ribosome-associated transcripts in Bay-0 and Lp2-6 revealed a signaling network regulating recovery processes. Differential recovery between the accessions was related to the activity of three genes: RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG (RBOHD), SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENE113 (SAG113) and ORESARA1 (ORE1/NAC6) which function in a regulatory network involving a reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst upon de-submergence and the hormones abscisic acid and ethylene. This regulatory module controls ROS homeostasis, stomatal aperture and chlorophyll degradation during submergence recovery. This work uncovers a signaling network that regulates recovery processes following flooding to hasten the return to pre-stress homeostasis.\\n\\nSignificance statementFlooding due to extreme weather events can be highly detrimental to plant development and yield. Speedy recovery following stress removal is an important determinant of tolerance, yet mechanisms regulating this remain largely uncharacterized. We identified a regulatory network in Arabidopsis thaliana that controls water loss and senescence to influence recovery from prolonged submergence. Targeted control of the molecular mechanisms facilitating stress recovery identified here can potentially improve performance of crops in flood-prone areas.",

The advance in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) provides the snapshots of single cell transcriptomes, thus offering an essential opportunity to study such complex biological processes. Here, we introduce a novel algorithm, DensityPath, which visualizes and reconstructs the underlying cell developmental trajectories for large-scale scRNAseq data. DensityPath has three merits. Firstly, by adopting the nonlinear dimension reduction algorithm elastic embedding, DensityPath reveals the intrinsic structures of the data. Secondly, by applying the powerful level set clustering method, DensityPath extracts the separate high density clusters of representative cell states (RCSs) from the single cell multimodal density landscape of gene expression space, enabling it to handle the heterogeneous scRNAseq data elegantly and accurately. Thirdly, DensityPath constructs cell state-transition path by finding the geodesic minimum spanning tree of the RCSs on the surface of the density landscape, making it more computationally efficient and accurate for large-scale dataset. The cell state-transition path constructed by DensityPath has the physical interpretation as the minimum-transition-energy (least-cost) path. We demonstrate that DensityPath is capable of identifying complex cell development trajectories with bifurcating and trifurcating branches on the human preimplantation embryos. We demonstrate that DensityPath is robust and has high accuracy of pseudotime calculation and branch assignment on the real scRNAseq as well as simulated datasets.",

One simple method to estimate the shape parameter of the gamma distribution is to 1) reconstruct a phylogenetic tree and the ancestral states of internal nodes, 2) perform pairwise comparison between nodes on each side of each branch to count the number of \\\"observed\\\" substitutions for each site, and apply correction of multiple hits to derive the estimated number of substitutions for each site, and 3) fit the site-specific substitution data to gamma distribution to obtain the shape parameter  This method is fast but its accuracy depends much on the accuracy of the estimated site-specific number of substitutions. The existing method has three shortcomings. First, it uses Poisson correction which is inadequate for almost any nucleotide sequences. Second, it does independent estimation for the number of substitutions at each site without making use of information at all sites. Third, the program implementing the method has never been made publically available.

When working with time series data, violating the implicit assumption of homogeneous dynamics below the scale of spatial aggregation could bias inferences about underlying processes. We tested this assumption in the context of the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic in Colombia, where time series of weekly case reports were available at national, departmental, and municipal scales. First, we performed a descriptive analysis, which showed that the timing of departmental-level epidemic peaks varied by three months and that departmental-level estimates of the time-varying reproduction number, R(t), showed patterns that were distinct from a national-level estimate. Second, we applied a classification algorithm to six features of proportional cumulative incidence curves, which showed that variability in epidemic duration, the length of the epidemic tail, and consistency with a cumulative normal density curve made the greatest contributions to distinguishing groups. Third, we applied this classification algorithm to data simulated with a stochastic transmission model, which showed that group assignments were consistent with simulated differences in the basic reproduction number, R0. This result, along with associations between spatial drivers of transmission and group assignments based on observed data, suggests that the classification algorithm is capable of detecting differences in temporal patterns that are associated with differences in underlying drivers of incidence patterns. Overall, this diversity of temporal patterns at local scales underscores the value of spatially disaggregated time series data.",

Here, we investigate evidence for links between polygenic ADHD risk and multiple literacy- and language-related abilities (LRAs), assessed in UK children (N[&le;]5,919), conditional on genetic effects shared with educational attainment (EA). Genome-wide summary statistics on clinical ADHD and years-of-schooling were obtained from large consortia (N[&le;]326,041). ADHD-polygenic scores (ADHD-PGS) were inversely associated with LRAs in ALSPAC, most consistently with reading-related abilities, and explained [&le;]1.6% phenotypic variation. Polygenic links were then dissected into both genetic effects shared with and independent of EA using multivariable regressions (MVR), analogous to Mendelian Randomization approaches accounting for mediating effects. Conditional on EA, polygenic ADHD risk remained associated with multiple literacy-related skills, phonemic awareness and verbal intelligence, but not language-related skills such as listening comprehension and non-word repetition. Pooled reading performance showed the strongest overlap with ADHD independent of EA. Using conservative ADHD-instruments (P-threshold<5x10-8) this corresponded to a 0.35 decrease in Z-scores per log-odds in ADHD-liability (P=9.2x10-5). Using subthreshold ADHD-instruments (P-threshold<0.0015), these associations had lower magnitude, but higher predictive accuracy, with a 0.03 decrease in Z-scores (P=1.4x10-6). Polygenic ADHD-effects shared with EA were of equal strength and at least equal magnitude compared to those independent of EA, for all LRAs studied, and only detectable using subthreshold instruments. Thus, ADHD-related polygenic links are highly susceptible to genetic confounding, concealing an ADHD-specific association profile that primarily involves reading-related impairments, but few language-related problems.",

    "abstract": "UBR1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase best known for its ability to target protein degradation by the N-end rule. The physiological functions of UBR family proteins, however, remain not fully understood. We found that the functional loss of C. elegans UBR-1 leads to a specific motor deficit: when adult animals generate reversal movements, A-class motor neurons exhibit synchronized activation, preventing body bending. This motor deficit is rescued by removing GOT-1, a transaminase that converts aspartate to glutamate. Both UBR-1 and GOT-1 are expressed and critically required in premotor interneurons of the reversal motor circuit to regulate the motor pattern. ubr-1 and got-1 mutants exhibit elevated and decreased glutamate level, respectively. These results raise an intriguing possibility that UBR proteins regulate glutamate metabolism, which is critical for neuronal development and signaling.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUbiquitin-mediated protein degradation is central to diverse biological processes. The selection of substrates for degradation is carried out by the E3 ubiquitin ligases, which target specific groups of proteins for ubiquitination. The human genome encodes hundreds of E3 ligases; many exhibit sequence conservation across animal species, including one such ligase called UBR1. Patients carrying mutations in UBR1 exhibit severe systemic defects, but the biology behinds UBR1s physiological function remains elusive. Here we found that the C. elegans UBR-1 regulates glutamate level. When UBR-1 is defective, C. elegans exhibits increased glutamate; this leads to synchronization of motor neuron activity, hence defective locomotion when animals reach adulthood. UBR1-mediated glutamate metabolism may contribute to the physiological defects of UBR1 mutations.",

While the first generation of epigenetic biomarkers of aging were developed using chronological age as a surrogate for biological age, we hypothesized that incorporation of composite clinical measures of phenotypic age that capture differences in lifespan and healthspan may identify novel CpGs and facilitate the development of a more powerful epigenetic biomarker of aging. Using a innovative two-step process, we develop a new epigenetic biomarker of aging, DNAm PhenoAge, that strongly outperforms previous measures in regards to predictions for a variety of aging outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cancers, healthspan, physical functioning, and Alzheimers disease. While this biomarker was developed using data from whole blood, it correlates strongly with age in every tissue and cell tested. Based on an in-depth transcriptional analysis in sorted cells, we find that increased epigenetic, relative to chronological age, is associated increased activation of pro-inflammatory and interferon pathways, and decreased activation of transcriptional/translational machinery, DNA damage response, and mitochondrial signatures. Overall, this single epigenetic biomarker of aging is able to capture risks for an array of diverse outcomes across multiple tissues and cells, and provide insight into important pathways in aging.",

    "abstract": "MotivationNext-generation deep sequencing of viral genomes, particularly on the Illumina platform, is increasingly applied in HIV research. Yet, there is no standard protocol or method used by the research community to account for measurement errors that arise during sample preparation and sequencing. Correctly calling high and low frequency variants while controlling for erroneous variant calls is an important precursor to downstream interpretation, such as studying the emergence of HIV drug-resistance mutations, which in turn has clinical applications and can improve patient care.\\n\\nResultsWe developed a new variant-calling pipeline, hivmmer, for Illumina sequences from HIV viral genomes. First, we validated hivmmer by comparing it to other variant-calling pipelines on real HIV plasmid data sets, which have known sequences. We found that hivmmer achieves a lower rate of erroneous variant calls, and that all methods agree on the frequency of correctly called variants. Next, we compared the methods on an HIV plasmid data set that was sequenced using an amplicon-tagging protocol called Primer ID, which is designed to reduce errors and amplification bias during library preparation. We show that the Primer ID consensus does indeed have fewer erroneous variant calls compared to the variant-calling pipelines, and that hivmmer more closely approaches this low error rate compared to the other pipelines. Surprisingly, the frequency estimates from the Primer ID consensus do not differ significantly from those of the variant-calling pipelines. Finally, we built a predictive model for classifying errors in the hivmmer alignment, and show that it achieves high accuracy for identifying erroneous variant calls.\\n\\nAvailabilityhivmmer is freely available for non-commercial use from https://github.com/mhowison/hivmmer.\\n\\nContactmhowison@brown.edu",

    "abstract": "We propose an empirical Bayes approach using a three-component mixture model, the L2N model, that may be applied to detect both differential expression (mean) and variation. It consists of two log-normal components (L2) for the differentially expressed (dispersed) features (one component for under-expressed [dispersed] and the other for over-expressed [dispersed] features), and a single normal component (N) for the null features (i.e., non-differentially expressed [dispersed] features). Simulation results show that L2N can capture asymmetries in the numbers of over-and under-expressed (dispersed) features (e.g., genes) when they exist, can provide a better fit to data in which the distributions of the null and non-null features are not well-separated, but can also perform well under symmetry and separation. Thus the L2N model is particularly appealing when no a priori biological knowledge about the mixture density is available. The L2N model is implemented in an R package called DVX, for Differential Variation and eXpression analysis. The package also includes an implementation of differential expression analysis via the limma package, and a differential variation and expression analysis using a three-way normal mixture model. DVX is a user-friendly, graphical interface implemented via the  Shiny package [6], so that a user is not required to have R programming knowledge. It offers a set of diagnostics plots, data transformation tools, and report generation in Microsoft Excel- and Word-compatible formats.

    "abstract": "A majority of cases of high-risk neuroblastoma, an embryonal childhood cancer, are driven by MYC or MYCN-driven oncogenic signaling. While considered to be directly \\\"undruggable\\\" therapeutically, MYC and MYCN can be repressed transcriptionally by inhibition of Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) or destabilized posttranslationally by inhibition of Aurora Kinase A (AURKA). Preclinical and early-phase clinical studies of BRD4 and AURKA inhibitors, however, show limited efficacy against neuroblastoma when used alone. We report our studies on the concomitant use of the BRD4 inhibitor IBET-151 and AURKA inhibitor alisertib. We show that, in vitro, the drugs act synergistically to inhibit viability in three models of high-risk neuroblastoma. We demonstrate that this synergy is driven, in part, by the ability of IBET-151 to mitigate reflexive upregulation of AURKA, MYC, and MYCN in response to AURKA inhibition. We then demonstrate that IBET-151 and alisertib are effective in prolonging survival in three xenograft neuroblastoma models in vivo, and this efficacy is augmented by the addition of the antitubule chemotherapeutic vincristine. These data suggest that epigenetic and posttranslational inhibition of MYC/MYCN-driven pathways may have significant clinical efficacy against neuroblastoma.\\n\\nAbbreviationsAURKA, aurora kinase A; BRD4, Bromodomain-containing protein 4; CI, combination index; Fa, fraction affected; LOH, loss of heterozygosity; 11q, long arm of chromosome 11\\n\\nFunding sourcesThis work was supported by the Families for a Cure foundation (grant number 20064014) and CancerFree Kids (grant number 82178416).",

However, over half of advanced ER-positive breast cancers are intrinsically resistant to tamoxifen and about 40% will acquire the resistance during the treatment.\\n\\nMethodsIn order to explore mechanisms underlying endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer and to identify new therapeutic opportunities, we created tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines that represent the luminal A or the luminal B. Gene expression patterns revealed by RNA-sequencing in seven tamoxifen-resistant variants were compared with their isogenic parental cells. We further examined those transcriptomic alterations in a publicly available patient cohort.\\n\\nResultsWe show that tamoxifen resistance cannot simply be explained by altered expression of individual genes, common mechanism across all resistant variants, or the appearance of new fusion genes. Instead, the resistant cell lines shared altered gene expression patterns associated with cell cycle, protein modification and metabolism, especially with the cholesterol pathway. In the tamoxifen-resistant T-47D cell variants we observed a striking increase of neutral lipids in lipid droplets as well as an accumulation of free cholesterol in the lysosomes. Tamoxifen-resistant cells were also less prone to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and not vulnerable to compounds targeting the lipid metabolism. However, the cells were sensitive to disulfiram, LCS-1, and dasatinib.\\n\\nConclusionAltogether, our findings highlight a major role of LMP prevention in tamoxifen resistance, and suggest novel drug vulnerabilities associated with this phenotype.",

    "abstract": "We present and analyze a growth model of an avascular tumor that considers the basic biological principles of proliferation, motility, death and genetic mutations of the cell. From a regulatory network analysis and an analysis of genomic data we identify two sets of genes-a set of six genes and a set of sixteen genes-that are believed to play an important role in the evolution of breast cancer. Considering that cancer cells shape the tissue microenvironment and niches to their competitive advantage, the model assumes that cancer and normal cells compete for essential nutrients and that the rate of the \\\"driver\\\" mutations depends on nutrient availability. To this end, we propose a coupling between the transport of nutrients and gene mutations dynamics. Gene mutation dynamics are modeled as a Yule-Furry Markovian process, while transport of nutrients is described with a system of reaction-diffusion equations. For each representative tumor we calculate its diversity, represented by the Shannon index, and its spatial heterogeneity, measured by its fractal dimension. These quantities are important in the clinical diagnosis of tumor malignancy. A tumor malignancy diagram, obtained by plotting diversity versus fractal dimension, is calculated for different values of a parameter {beta}, which is related to the occurrence of driver mutations. It is found that when {beta} < 1, tumors show greater diversity and more spatial heterogeneity as compared with {beta} > 1. More importantly, it is found that the results and conclusions are similar when we use the six-gene set versus sixteen-gene set.",

Strikingly, this increase in presynaptic mitochondrial size upon MFF downregulation augments their capacity for Ca2+ ([Ca2+]m) uptake during neurotransmission, leading to reduced presynaptic [Ca2+]c accumulation, decreased presynaptic release and terminal axon branching.

Germ granule dysfunction did not elicit transposon expression but was sufficient to induce multiple phenotypes found in sterile Piwi silencing mutants, including germline atrophy and regrowth. Furthermore, loss of the germ granule component PGL-1 accelerated sterility in response to deficiency for prg-1/Piwi. Restoration of germ granule function to sterile pgl-1 mutants restored their fertility.

For both, we find a clear  out of testis transition from the testis-specific young genes to the broadly expressed old housekeeping genes. Particularly, many new genes have evolved specific activation at maternal-zygotic transition, or distinctive spatiotemporal embryonic expression patterns from the parental genes. We uncover an age-dependent gain/loss of active/repressive histone modifications and cis-regulatory elements, with variations between species and between somatic/germline tissues, which together underpin the stepwise acquisition of novel and important function by new genes.

    "abstract": "Modern phylogenetic methods used to study how traits evolve often require a single species tree as input, and do not take underlying gene tree discordance into account. Such approaches may lead to errors in phylogenetic inference because of hemiplasy -- the process by which single changes on discordant trees appear to be homoplastic when analyzed on a fixed species tree. Hemiplasy has been shown to affect inferences about discrete traits, but it is still unclear whether complications arise when quantitative traits are analyzed. In order to address this question and to characterize the effect of hemiplasy on traits controlled by a large number of loci, we present a multispecies coalescent model for quantitative traits evolving along a species tree. We demonstrate theoretically and through simulations that hemiplasy decreases the expected covariances in trait values between more closely related species relative to the covariances between more distantly related species. This effect leads to an overestimation of a traits evolutionary rate parameter, to a decrease of the traits phylogenetic signal, and to increased false positive rates in comparative methods such as the phylogenetic ANOVA. We also show that hemiplasy affects discrete, threshold traits that have an underlying continuous liability, leading to false inferences of convergent evolution. The number of loci controlling a quantitative trait appears to be irrelevant to the trends reported, for all analyses. Our results demonstrate that gene tree discordance and hemiplasy are a problem for all types of traits, across a wide range of methods. Our analyses also point to the conditions under which hemiplasy is most likely to be a factor, and suggest future approaches that may mitigate its effects.",

In addition, high frequency loss of function variants in the Genome Aggregation Database, and disease-causing variants in ClinVar and the Human Gene Mutation Database across the 109 genes were queried. These data were used to classify exons as \\\"clinically relevant\\\", \\\"uncertain significance\\\", or \\\"clinically insignificant\\\". Interestingly, 7% of all exons, containing >124 \\\"clinically significant\\\" variants, were of \\\"uncertain significance\\\". Finally, we used exon-level next generation sequencing quality metrics generated at two clinical labs, and identified a total of 43 technically challenging exons in 20 different genes that had inadequate coverage and/or homology issues which might lead to false variant calls. We have demonstrated that transcript analysis plays a critical role in accurate clinical variant interpretation.",

    "abstract": "The global regulator Lrp plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism, virulence and motility in response to environmental conditions. Lrp has previously been shown to activate or repress approximately 10% of genes in Escherichia coli. However, the full spectrum of targets, and how Lrp acts to regulate them, has stymied earlier study. We have combined matched ChIP-seq and RNA sequencing under nine physiological conditions to map the binding and regulatory activity of Lrp as it directs responses to nutrient abundance. In addition to identifying hundreds of novel Lrp targets, we observe two new global trends: first, that Lrp will often bind to promoters in a poised position under conditions when it has no regulatory activity, and second, that nutrient levels induce a global shift in the equilibrium between non-specific and sequence-specific DNA binding. The overall regulatory behavior of Lrp, which as we now show regulates 35% of E. coli genes directly or indirectly under at least one condition, thus arises from the interaction between changes in Lrp binding specificity and cooperative action with other regulators.",

    "abstract": "The rapid horizontal transmission of many antibiotic resistance genes between bacterial host cells on conjugative plasmids is a major cause of the accelerating antibiotic resistance crisis. Preventing understanding and targeting conjugation, there currently are no experimental platforms for fast and cost-efficient screening of genetic effects on antibiotic resistance transmission by conjugation. We introduce a novel experimental framework to screen for conjugation based horizontal transmission of antibiotic resistance between >60.000 pairs of cell populations in parallel. Plasmid-carrying donor strains are constructed in high throughput. We then mix the resistance plasmid carrying donors with recipients in a design where only transconjugants can reproduce, measure growth in dense intervals and extract transmission times as the growth lag. As proof-of-principle, we exhaustively explored chromosomal genes controlling F plasmid donation within E. coli populations, by screening the Keio deletion collection at high replication. We recover all six known chromosomal gene mutants affecting conjugation and identify >50 novel factors, all of which diminish antibiotic resistance transmission. We verify 10 of the novel genes effects in a liquid mating assay. The new framework holds great potential for exhaustive disclosing of candidate targets for helper drugs that delay resistance development in patients and societies and improves the longevity of current and future antibiotics.",

The vaccine candidates under development require a tetravalent immunogen to induce a balanced immunity against all four serotypes of dengue virus. Herein we show that mice vaccinated with highly matured virus-like particles derived from DENV serotype 2 (mD2VLP) can generate higher and broader neutralization antibodies (NtAbs) against all 4 serotypes of DENV through clonal expansion supported by hybridoma and B-cell repertoire analysis. The cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction showed that mD2VLP particles possess a T=1 icosahedral symmetry with a groove located within the E-protein dimers near the 2-fold vertices that exposed highly overlapping, cryptic neutralizing epitopes. Most importantly, maternally transferred antibodies derived from mD2VLP-vaccinated female mice protected suckling mice from lethal challenge by all four serotypes of DENV. Our results support the fact that a universal dengue vaccine that protects against all four serotypes of dengue viruses can be achieved by using an immunogen such as mD2VLP.",

The 3.7 [A] cryo-EM structure of a closed trimer of the clathrin adaptor AP-1, the small GTPase Arf1, HIV-1 Nef, and the cytosolic tail of the restriction factor tetherin suggested a mechanism for inactivating tetherin by Golgi retention. The 4.3 [A] structure of a mutant Nef-induced dimer of AP-1 showed how the closed trimer is regulated by the dileucine loop of Nef. HDX-MS and mutational analysis were used to show how cargo dynamics leads to alternative Arf1 trimerization, directing Nef targets to be either retained at the trans-Golgi or sorted to lysosomes. Phosphorylation of the NL4-3 M-Nef was shown to regulate AP-1 trimerization, explaining how O-Nefs lacking this phosphosite counteract tetherin but most M-Nefs do not. These observations show how the higher-order organization of a vesicular coat can be allosterically modulated to direct cargoes to distinct fates.",

Using fMRI we show the brain encodes sequence-specific information in the motor system.

However, not only do the precise genetic mechanisms specifying neuronal cell types remain obscure, access to these neuronal cell types by transgenic techniques also remains elusive. While most genes are expressed in the brain, the vast majority are expressed in many different kinds of neurons, suggesting that promoters alone are not sufficiently specific to distinguish cell types. However, there are orders of magnitude more distal genetic cis-regulatory elements controlling transcription (i.e. enhancers), so we screened for enhancer activity in microdissected samples of mouse cortical subregions. This identified thousands of novel putative enhancers, many unique to particular cortical subregions. Pronuclear injection of expression constructs containing such region-specific enhancers resulted in transgenic lines driving expression in distinct sets of cells specifically in the targeted cortical subregions, even though the parent genes promoter was relatively nonspecific. These data showcase the promise of utilizing the genetic mechanisms underlying the specification of diverse neuronal cell types for the development of genetic tools potentially capable of targeting any neuronal circuit of interest, an approach we call Enhancer-Driven Gene Expression (EDGE).\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIEnhancer ChIP-seq of cortical subregions reveals 59372 putative enhancers.\\nC_LIO_LI3740 of these are specific to particular cortical subregions.\\nC_LIO_LIThis reflects the remarkable anatomical diversity of the adult cortex.\\nC_LIO_LIUnique enhancers provide a means to make targeted cell-type specific genetic tools.\\nC_LI",

Several studies have shown the potential of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a green tea flavanol, as a therapeutic tool for alleviating different developmental alterations associated with DS, such as cognitive impairment, skull dysmorphologies, and skeletal deficiencies. Here we provide for the first time experimental and clinical evidence of the potential benefits of EGCG treatment to facial morphology. Our results showed that mouse models treated with low dose of EGCG during pre- and postnatal development improved facial dysmorphology. However, the same treatment at high dose produced disparate facial morphology changes with an extremely wide and abnormal range of variation. Our observational study in humans revealed that EGCG treatment since early in development is associated with intermediate facial phenotypes and significant facial improvement scores. Overall, our findings suggest a potential beneficial effect of ECGC on facial development, which requires further research to pinpoint the optimal dosages of EGCG that reliably improve DS phenotypes.

For a pool of individuals, each associated with a unique characteristic feature, as the pool size grows, the possible interactions increase exponentially, quickly beyond the scope of computation, not to mention experimental manipulation and analysis. Herein, we report a facile RT-PCR-based method, to correlate the amplification curves with various DNA libraries of defined diversity, and perform operations with groups of quaternary numbers as input and diversity as output. An attractive feature of this approach is the possibility of realizing parallel computation with an eventually unlimited number of variables. We demonstrate that DNA libraries can be used to model heterogeneous populations, exhibiting functions such as self-protection, subjected to biased expansion, and to evolve into complex structures. Moreover, the method can be applied to drug discovery using DNA-encoded chemical library (DECL) technology, to optimize selection conditions for identifying potent and specific bio-molecular interactions.",

    "abstract": "Using single-cell-omics data, it is now possible to computationally order cells along trajectories, allowing the unbiased study of cellular dynamic processes. Since 2014, more than 50 trajectory inference methods have been developed, each with its own set of methodological characteristics. As a result, choosing a method to infer trajectories is often challenging, since a comprehensive assessment of the performance and robustness of each method is still lacking. In order to facilitate the comparison of the results of these methods to each other and to a gold standard, we developed a global framework to benchmark trajectory inference tools. Using this framework, we compared the trajectories from a total of 29 trajectory inference methods, on a large collection of real and synthetic datasets. We evaluate methods using several metrics, including accuracy of the inferred ordering, correctness of the network topology, code quality and user friendliness. We found that some methods, including Slingshot, TSCAN and Monocle DDRTree, clearly outperform other methods, although their performance depended on the type of trajectory present in the data. Based on our benchmarking results, we therefore developed a set of guidelines for method users. However, our analysis also indicated that there is still a lot of room for improvement, especially for methods detecting complex trajectory topologies. Our evaluation pipeline can therefore be used to spearhead the development of new scalable and more accurate methods, and is available at github.com/dynverse/dynverse.\\n\\nTo our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive assessment of trajectory inference methods. For now, we exclusively evaluated the methods on their default parameters, but plan to add a detailed parameter tuning procedure in the future. We gladly welcome any discussion and feedback on key decisions made as part of this study, including the metrics used in the benchmark, the quality control checklist, and the implementation of the method wrappers.

Although mitochondria-derived antimicrobial effectors such as reactive oxygen species (mROS) are reported to aid in bacterial killing, it is unclear how these effectors reach bacteria within the phagosomal lumen. To examine the crosstalk between mitochondria and phagosomes, we monitored the production and the spatial localization of mROS during methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. We showed here mROS, specifically hydrogen peroxide (mH2O2) can be delivered into phagosomes via infection-induced mitochondria-derived vesicles, which are generated in a Parkin-dependent manner. Accumulation of mH2O2 in phagosomes required TLR signaling and the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, Sod2, which converts superoxide into mH2O2. These data highlight a novel mechanism by which the mitochondrial redox capacity enhances macrophage antimicrobial function by delivering mitochondria-derived effector molecules into bacteria-containing phagosomes.",

We identified mammary-derived growth inhibitor (MDGI/FABP3) as invasive glioma biomarker. Here, we show that high MDGI expression associated with poor patient survival and promoted invasive glioma cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, while MDGI silencing drastically compromised patient-derived tumoroid viability via induction of lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). This alternative cell death pathway provokes release of lysosomal hydrolases into the cytosol leading inevitably to the cell death. Our results show a novel functional role for MDGI in glioma cell invasion, survival, and maintenance of the lysosomal membrane integrity as well as an unsuspected sensitivity of glioma cells to an LMP-inducing drug, anti-histamine clemastine. In a preclinical study, clemastine-treatment significantly prolonged the survival of intracranial glioblastoma-bearing animals due to eradication of invasive glioma cells. This glioma cell vulnerability to LMP-inducing drugs opens new horizons for development of novel treatments and suggest re-positioning of an established drug for new indication.",

Emerging evidence suggests that cells may also recognize alterations in cellular processes induced by infection.

Here we used a chemical biology approach to perturb the cellular ubiquitin proteome as a simplified model to study the direct effect of ubiquitin homeostasis on macrophage responses. We show that perturbation of ubiquitin homeostasis results in a rapid and transient burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that promotes macrophage anti-infective capacity.

    "abstract": "Sensory neurons embedded in skin are responsible for the sense of touch. In humans and other mammals, touch sensation depends on thousands of diverse somatosensory neurons. By contrast, Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes have six gentle touch receptor neurons linked to simple behaviors. The classical touch assay uses an eyebrow hair to stimulate freely moving C. elegans, evoking evasive behavioral responses. While this assay has led to the discovery of genes required for touch sensation, it does not provide control over stimulus strength or position. Here, we present an integrated system for performing automated, quantitative touch assays that circumvents these limitations and incorporates automated measurements of behavioral responses. Highly Automated Worm Kicker (HAWK) unites microfabricated silicon force sensors and video analysis with real-time force and position control. Using this system, we stimulated animals along the anterior-posterior axis and compared responses in wild-type and spc-1(dn) transgenic animals, which have a touch defect due to expression of a dominant-negative  spectrin protein fragment. As expected from prior studies, delivering large stimuli anterior to the mid-point of the body evoked a reversal, but such a stimulus applied posterior to the mid-point evoked a speed-up. The probability of evoking a response of either kind depended on stimulus strength and location; once initiated, the magnitude and quality of both reversal and speed-up behavioral responses were uncorrelated with stimulus location, strength, or the absence or presence of the spc-1(dn) transgene. Wild-type animals failed to respond when the stimulus was applied near the mid-point. These results establish that stimulus strength and location govern the activation of a stereotyped motor program and that the C. elegans body surface consists of two receptive fields separated by a gap.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent advances in single-molecule sequencing techniques, such as Nanopore sequencing, improved read length, increased sequencing throughput, and enabled direct detection of DNA modifications through the analysis of raw signals. These DNA modifications include naturally occurring modifications such as DNA methylations, as well as modifications that are introduced by DNA damage or through synthetic modifications to one of the four standard nucleotides.\\n\\nMethodsTo improve the performance of detecting DNA modifications, especially synthetically introduced modifications, we developed a novel computational tool called NanoMod. NanoMod takes raw signal data on a pair of DNA samples with and without modified bases, extracts signal intensities, performs base error correction based on a reference sequence, and then identifies bases with modifications by comparing the distribution of raw signals between two samples, while taking into account of the effects of neighboring bases on modified bases (\\\"neighborhood effects\\\").\\n\\nResultsWe evaluated NanoMod on simulation data sets, based on different types of modifications and different magnitudes of neighborhood effects, and found that NanoMod outperformed other methods in identifying known modified bases. Additionally, we demonstrated superior performance of NanoMod on an E. coli data set with 5mC (5-methylcytosine) modifications.\\n\\nConclusionsIn summary, NanoMod is a flexible tool to detect DNA modifications with single-base resolution from raw signals in Nanopore sequencing, and will greatly facilitate large-scale functional genomics experiments in the future that use modified nucleotides.",

    "abstract": "The Earths biota is changing over time in complex ways. A critical challenge is to test whether specific biomes, taxa or types of species benefit or suffer in a time of accelerating global change. We analysed nearly 10 000 abundance time series from over 2000 vertebrate species part of the Living Planet Database. We integrated abundance data with information on geographic range, habitat preference, taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships, and IUCN Red List Categories and threats. We found that 15% of populations declined, 18% increased, and 67% showed no net changes over time. Against a backdrop of no biogeographic and phylogenetic patterning in population change, we uncovered a distinct taxonomic signal. Amphibians were the only taxa that experienced net declines in the analysed data, while birds, mammals and reptiles experienced net increases. Population trends were poorly captured by species rarity and global-scale threats. Incorporation of the full spectrum of population change will improve conservation efforts to protect global biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "The eastern larch beetle (Dendroctonus simplex Le Conte) is recognized as a serious destructive forest pest in the upper part of North America. Under epidemic conditions, this beetle can attack healthy trees, causing severe damages to larch stands. Dendroctonus species are considered as holobionts, as they engage in multipartite interactions with microorganisms, such as bacteria, filamentous fungi, and yeasts, which are implicated in physiological processes of the insect, such as nutrition. They also play a key role in the beetles attack, as they are responsible for the detoxification of the subcortical environment and weaken the trees defense mechanisms. The eastern larch beetle is associated with bacteria and fungi, but their implication in the success of the beetle remains unknown. Here, we investigated the bacterial and fungal microbiota of this beetle pest throughout its ontogeny (pioneer adults, larvae and pupae) by high-throughput sequencing. A successional microbial assemblage was identified throughout the beetle developmental stages, reflecting the beetles requirements. These results indicate that a symbiotic association between the eastern larch beetle and some of these microorganisms takes place and that this D. simplex symbiotic complex is helping the insect to colonize its host tree and survive the conditions encountered.",

We applied the method to members of five different families of ssRNA positive-strand viruses, and each family formed a distinct cluster.

In addition, miRNA \\\"isomiRs\\\" arise from the same precursor molecule but differ in post-processing length and modification, usually at the 3 end. A recently published feeding study reported the intriguing result that two bovine milk-specific miRNAs were taken up into human circulation after ingestion of bovine milk. Unfortunately, this interpretation is based on annotation errors in a public microRNA database. Reanalysis using databses including the MirGeneDB database reveals that the miRNAs in question, miR-21-5p and miR-30a-5p, arise from 100% identical 5 precursor sequences in human and bovine, and the putative bovine-specific isomiRs appear to be depleted, not enriched, in bovine milk. Thus, enrichment of these isomiRs in human blood is inconsistent with uptake of xenomiRs and likely betrays endogenous miRNA regulation in response to diet or technical artifact.",

    "abstract": "The importance of a mesoscopic description level of the brain has now been well established. Rate based models are widely used, but have limitations. Recently, several extremely efficient population-level methods have been proposed that go beyond the characterization of a population in terms of a single variable. Here, we present a method for simulating neural populations based on two dimensional (2D) point spiking neuron models that defines the state of the population in terms of a density function over the neural state space. Our method differs in that we do not make the diffusion approximation, nor do we reduce the state space to a single dimension (1D). We do not hard code the neural model, but read in a grid describing its state space in the relevant simulation region. Novel models can be studied without even recompiling the code. The method is highly modular: variations of the deterministic neural dynamics and the stochastic process can be investigated independently. Currently, there is a trend to reduce complex high dimensional neuron models to 2D ones as they offer a rich dynamical repertoire that is not available in 1D, such as limit cycles. We will demonstrate that our method is ideally suited to investigate noise in such systems, replicating results obtained in the diffusion limit and generalizing them to a regime of large jumps. The joint probability density function is much more informative than 1D marginals, and we will argue that the study of 2D systems subject to noise is important complementary to 1D systems.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA group of slow, noisy and unreliable cells collectively implement our mental faculties, and how they do this is still one of the big scientific questions of our time. Mechanistic explanations of our cognitive skills, be it locomotion, object handling, language comprehension or thinking in general - whatever that may be - is still far off. A few years ago the following question was posed: Imagine that aliens would provide us with a brain-sized clump of matter, with complete freedom to sculpt realistic neuronal networks with arbitrary precision. Would we be able to build a brain? The answer appears to be no, because this technology is actually materializing, not in the form of an alien kick-start, but through steady progress in computing power, simulation methods and the emergence of databases on connectivity, neural cell types, complete with gene expression, etc. A number of groups have created brain-scale simulations, others like the Blue Brain project may not have simulated a full brain, but they included almost every single detail known about the neurons they modelled. And yet, we do not know how we reach for a glass of milk.\\n\\nMechanistic, large-scale models require simulations that bridge multiple scales. Here we present a method that allows the study of two dimensional dynamical systems subject to noise, with very little restrictions on the dynamical system or the nature of the noise process. Given that high dimensional realistic models of neurons have been reduced successfully to two dimensional dynamical systems, while retaining all essential dynamical features, we expect that this method will contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of larger brain networks without requiring the level of detail that make brute force large-scale simulations so unwieldy.",

    "abstract": "Visual mental imagery is the quasi-perceptual experience of \\\"seeing in the minds eye\\\". While a tight correspondence between imagery and perception in terms of subjective experience is well established, their correspondence in terms of neural representations remains insufficiently understood. In the present study, we exploit the high spatial resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 7T, the retinotopic organization of early visual cortex, and machine learning techniques to investigate whether visual imagery of letter shapes preserves the topographic organization of perceived shapes. Sub-millimeter resolution fMRI images were obtained from early visual cortex in six subjects performing visual imagery of four different letter shapes. Predictions of imagery voxel activation patterns based on a population receptive field encoding model and physical letter stimuli provided first evidence in favor of detailed topographic organization. Subsequent visual field reconstructions of imagery data based on the inversion of the encoding model further showed that visual imagery preserves the geometric profile of letter shapes. These results open new avenues for decoding as we show that a denoising autoencoder can be used to pretrain a classifier purely based on perceptual data before fine-tuning it on imagery data. Finally, we show that the autoencoder can project imagery-related voxel activations onto their perceptual counterpart allowing for visually recognizable reconstructions even at the single-trial level. The latter may eventually be utilized for the development of content-based BCI letter-speller systems.",
