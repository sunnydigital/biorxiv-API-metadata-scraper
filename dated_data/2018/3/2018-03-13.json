    "abstract": "PurposeThe prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) varies significantly based on assay sensitivity and patient geography. Accurate detection is essential to understand the role of HPV in disease prognosis and management of patients with OSCC.\\n\\nMethodsWe generated and integrated data from multiple analytes (HPV DNA, HPV RNA, and p16), assays (immunohistochemistry, PCR, qPCR and digital PCR) and molecular changes (somatic mutations and DNA methylation) from 153 OSCC patients to correlate p16 expression, HPV DNA, and HPV RNA with HPV incidence and patient survival.\\n\\nResultsHigh prevalence (33-58%) of HPV16/18 DNA did not correlate with the presence of transcriptionally active viral genomes (15%) in tumors. Eighteen percent of the tumors were p16 positive. and only 6% were both HPV DNA and RNA positive. Most tumors with relatively high-copy HPV DNA, and/or HPV RNA, but not with HPV DNA alone (irrespective of copy number), were wild-type for TP53 and CASP8 genes. In our study, p16 protein, HPV DNA and HPV RNA, either alone or in combinations, did not correlate with patient survival. Nine HPV-associated genes stratified the virus +ve from the -ve tumor group with high confidence (p<0.008) when HPV DNA copy number and/or HPV RNA were considered to define HPV positivity and not HPV DNA alone irrespective of their copy number (p < 0.2).\\n\\nConclusionsIn OSCC, the presence of both HPV RNA and p16 are rare. HPV DNA alone is not an accurate measure of HPV positivity and therefore not informative. Moreover, HPV DNA, RNA or p16 dont correlate with outcome.",

    "abstract": "Variation in the gut microbiome has been linked to colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as to host genetic variation. However, we do not know whether, in addition to baseline host genetics, somatic mutational profiles in CRC tumors interact with the surrounding tumor microbiome, and if so, whether these changes can be used to understand microbe-host interactions with potential functional biological relevance. Here, we characterized the association between CRC microbial communities and tumor mutations using microbiome profiling and whole-exome sequencing in 44 pairs of tumors and matched normal tissues. We found statistically significant associations between loss-of-function mutations in tumor genes and shifts in the abundances of specific sets of bacterial taxa, suggestive of potential functional interaction. This correlation allows us to statistically predict interactions between loss-of-function tumor mutations in cancer-related genes and pathways, including MAPK and Wnt signaling, solely based on the composition of the microbiome. These results can serve as a starting point for fine-grained exploration of the functional interactions between discrete alterations in tumor DNA and proximal microbial communities in CRC. In addition, these findings can lead to the development of improved microbiome-based CRC screening methods, as well as individualized microbiota-targeting therapies.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAlthough the gut microbiome - the collection of microorganisms that inhabit our gastrointestinal tract - has been implicated in colorectal cancer, colorectal tumors are caused by genetic mutations in host DNA. Here, we explored whether various mutations in colorectal tumors are correlated with specific changes in the bacterial communities that live in and on these tumors. We find that the genes and biological pathways that are mutated in tumors are correlated with variation in the composition of the microbiome. In fact, these changes in the microbiome are consistent enough that we can use them to statistically predict tumor mutations solely based on the microbiome. Our results may be used to understand the roles of specific microbes in CRC biology, and could also be the starting point of microbiome-based diagnostics for not only detection of CRC, but characterization of tumor mutational profiles.",

    "abstract": "Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is associated to peripheral fluid homeostasis and cardiovascular function, but recent evidence has also drawn its functional role in the brain. RAS has been described to regulate physiological and behavioral parameters related to stress response, including depressive symptoms. Apparently, RAS can modulate levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TRKB, which are important to neurobiology of depression and antidepressant action. However, interaction between BDNF/TRKB system and RAS in models predictive of antidepressant effect has not been investigated before. Accordingly, in the forced swimming test, we observed an antidepressant-like effect of systemic losartan but not with captopril or enalapril treament. Moreover, infusion of losartan into ventral hippocampus (vHC) and prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL) mimicked the consequences of systemically injected losartan, whereas K252a, a blocker of TRK, infused into these brain areas impaired such effect. PD123319, an antagonist of AT2 receptor (AGTR2), infused into PL but not into vHC, also prevented systemic losartan effect. Cultured cortical cells of rat embryos indicate that angiotensin II (ANG2), possibly through AGTR2, increases the surface levels of TRKB, and favors its coupling to FYN, a SRC family kinase. The higher levels of agtr2 in cortical cells were decreased after insult with glutamate, and under this condition an interaction between losartan and ANG2 was achieved. Occurrence of TRKB/AGTR2 heterodimers was also observed, in MG87 cells GFP-tagged AGTR2 co-immunoprecipitated with TRKB. Therefore, antidepressant-like effect of losartan is proposed to occur through a shift of ANG2 binding towards AGTR2, followed by coupling of TRK/FYN and putative TRKB transactivation. Thus, AGTR1 show therapeutic potential as novel antidepressant therapy.",

    "abstract": "The current level of penicillin use and its persisting residues in livestock is potentially concerning; the toxicity of penicillin residues in heat-treated animal food products (HAFP) is yet to be elucidated. In this study, the acute and chronic toxicity of benzylpenicillin G (BPG) residues in HAFP was investigated in a mouse model. The calculated LD50 of BPG heated to cooking temperature (BPHCT) was 933.04 mg kg-1 [b.w.] intraperitoneally corresponding to 3.75 times lower than its prototype. Mice fed on the experimental diet containing heat-treated beef with high BPG levels for 6 months displayed a reduction in body weight and altered serum values indicating for liver and renal function. Further, the organ ratios of intestinal and spleen were increased. Histopathological changes were observed in the liver, lung and parenchyma testis tissue. BPHCT residue induced sperm aberration and micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes formation. Present results indicate that prolonged exposure of BPHCT at higher levels of residue might have an impact on public health. Importantly the toxic concentrations of BPHCT are relatively high compared with levels that would result from the degradation of antibiotic residues in meat from animals that have received a therapeutic dose of BPG.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiota are shaped by a combination of ecological and evolutionary forces. While the ecological dynamics have been extensively studied, much less is known about how species of gut bacteria evolve over time. Here we introduce a model-based framework for quantifying evolutionary dynamics within and across hosts using a panel of metagenomic samples. We use this approach to study evolution in [~]30 prevalent species in the human gut. Although the patterns of between-host diversity are consistent with quasi-sexual evolution and purifying selection on long timescales, we identify new genealogical signatures that challenge standard population genetic models of these processes. Within hosts, we find that genetic differences that accumulate over [~]6 month timescales are only rarely attributable to replacement by distantly related strains. Instead, the resident strains more commonly acquire a smaller number of putative evolutionary changes, in which nucleotide variants or gene gains or losses rapidly sweep to high frequency. By comparing these mutations with the typical between-host differences, we find evidence that some sweeps are seeded by recombination, in addition to new mutations. However, comparisons of adult twins suggest that replacement eventually overwhelms evolution over multi-decade timescales, hinting at fundamental limits to the extent of local adaptation. Together, our results suggest that gut bacteria can evolve on human-relevant timescales, and they highlight the connections between these short-term evolutionary dynamics and longer-term evolution across hosts.",

    "abstract": "Most epigenome-wide association studies to date have been conducted in blood. However, metabolic syndrome is mediated by a dysregulation of adiposity and therefore it is critical to study adipose tissue in order to understand the effects of this syndrome on epigenomes. To determine if natural variation in DNA methylation was associated with metabolic syndrome traits, we profiled global methylation levels in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue. We measured association between 32 clinical traits related to diabetes and obesity in 201 people from the Metabolic Syndrome In Men cohort. We performed epigenome-wide association studies between DNA methylation levels and traits, and identified associations for 13 clinical traits in 21 loci. We prioritized candidate genes in these loci using eQTL, and identified 18 high confidence candidate genes, including known and novel genes associated with diabetes and obesity traits. Using methylation deconvolution, we examined which cell types may be mediating the associations, and concluded that most of the loci we identified were specific to adipocytes. We determined whether the abundance of cell types varies with metabolic traits, and found that macrophages increased in abundance with the severity of metabolic syndrome traits. Finally, we developed a DNA methylation based biomarker to assess type II diabetes risk in adipose tissue. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that profiling DNA methylation in adipose tissue is a powerful tool for understanding the molecular effects of metabolic syndrome on adipose tissue, and can be used in conjunction with traditional genetic analyses to further characterize this disorder.",

    "abstract": "Glutamatergic synapses display a rich repertoire of plasticity mechanisms on many different time scales, involving dynamic changes in the efficacy of transmitter release as well as changes in the number and function of postsynaptic glutamate receptors. The genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR enables visualization of glutamate release from presynaptic terminals at frequencies up to [~]10 Hz. However, to resolve glutamate dynamics during high frequency bursts, faster indicators are required. Here we report the development of fast (iGluf) and ultrafast (iGluu) variants with comparable brightness, but increased Kd for glutamate (137 M and 600 M, respectively). Compared to iGluSnFR, iGluu has a 6-fold faster dissociation rate in vitro and 5-fold faster kinetics in synapses. Fitting a three-state model to kinetic data, we identify the large conformational change after glutamate binding as the rate-limiting step. In rat hippocampal slice culture stimulated at 100 Hz, we find that iGluu is sufficiently fast to resolve individual glutamate release events, revealing that glutamate is rapidly cleared from the synaptic cleft. Depression of iGluu responses during 100 Hz trains correlates with depression of postsynaptic EPSPs, indicating that depression during high frequency stimulation is purely presynaptic in origin. At individual boutons, the recovery from depression could be predicted from the amount of glutamate released on the second pulse (paired pulse facilitation/depression), demonstrating differential frequency-dependent filtering of spike trains at Schaffer collateral boutons.\\n\\nSignificance StatementExcitatory synapses convert presynaptic action potentials into chemical signals that are sensed by postsynaptic glutamate receptors. To eavesdrop on synaptic transmission, genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for glutamate have been developed. However, even the best available sensors lag behind the very fast glutamate dynamics in the synaptic cleft. Here we report the development of an ultrafast genetically encoded glutamate sensor, iGluu, which allowed us to image glutamate clearance and synaptic depression during 100 Hz spike trains. We found that only boutons showing paired-pulse facilitation were able to rapidly recover from depression. Thus, presynaptic boutons act as frequency-specific filters to transmit select features of the spike train to specific postsynaptic cells.",

    "abstract": "Impact statementSelective synapse formation in a retinal motion-sensitive circuit is orchestrated by starburst amacrine cells, which use homotypic interactions to initiate formation of a dendritic scaffold that recruits projections from circuit partners.\\n\\nSUMMARYA common strategy by which developing neurons locate their synaptic partners is through projections to circuit-specific neuropil sublayers. Once established, sublayers serve as a substrate for selective synapse formation, but how sublayers arise during neurodevelopment remains unknown. Here we identify the earliest events that initiate formation of the direction-selective circuit in the inner plexiform layer of mouse retina. We demonstrate that radially-migrating newborn starburst amacrine cells establish homotypic contacts on arrival at the inner retina. These contacts, mediated by the cell-surface protein MEGF10, trigger neuropil innervation resulting in generation of two sublayers comprising starburst-cell dendrites. This dendritic scaffold then recruits projections from circuit partners. Abolishing MEGF10-mediated contacts profoundly delays and ultimately disrupts sublayer formation, leading to broader direction tuning and weaker direction-selectivity in retinal ganglion cells. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which differentiating neurons transition from migratory to mature morphology, and highlight this mechanisms importance in forming circuit-specific sublayers.",

    "abstract": "Organisms as simple as bacteria can engage in complex collective actions, such as group motility and fruiting body formation. Some of these actions involve a division of labor, where phenotypically specialized clonal subpopulations, or genetically distinct lineages cooperate with each other by performing complementary tasks. Here, we combine experimental and computational approaches to investigate potential benefits arising from division of labor during biofilm matrix production. We show that both phenotypic and genetic strategies for a division of labor can promote collective biofilm formation in the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. In this species, biofilm matrix consists of two major components; EPS and TasA. We observed that clonal groups of B. subtilis phenotypically segregate into three subpopulations composed of matrix non-producers, EPS-producers, and generalists, which produce both EPS and TasA. This incomplete phenotypic specialization was outperformed by a genetic division of labor, where two mutants, engineered as specialists, complemented each other by exchanging EPS and TasA. The relative fitness of the two mutants displayed a negative frequency dependence both in vitro and on plant roots, with strain frequency reaching a stable equilibrium at 30% TasA-producers, corresponding exactly to the population composition where group productivity is maximized. Using individual-based modelling, we show that asymmetries in strain ratio can arise due to differences in the relative benefits that matrix compounds generate for the collective; and that genetic division of labor can be favored when it breaks metabolic constraints associated with the simultaneous production of two matrix components.\\n\\nHighlights- matrix components EPS and TasA are costly public goods in B. subtilis biofilms\\n\\n- genetic division of labor using {Delta}eps and {Delta}tasA fosters maximal biofilm productivity\\n\\n- {Delta}eps and {Delta}tasA cooperation is evolutionary stable in laboratory and ecological systems\\n\\n- costly metabolic coupling of public goods favors genetic division of labor",

The aberrant PGR-targeted gene expression in PCOS-like rats before and after implantation overlaps with dysregulated expression of Fkbp52 and Ncoa2, two genes that contribute to the development of uterine P4 resistance. In vivo and in vitro studies of the effects of metformin on the regulation of the uterine P4 signaling pathway under PCOS conditions showed that metformin directly inhibits the expression of PGR and ER along with the regulation of several genes that are targeted dependently or independently of PGR-mediated uterine implantation. Functionally, metformin treatment corrected the abnormal expression of cell-specific PGR and ER and some PGR-target genes in PCOS-like rats with implantation. Additionally, we documented how metformin contributes to the regulation of the PGR-associated MAPK/ERK/p38 signaling pathway in the PCOS-like rat uterus.

    "abstract": "The brain is a massive neuronal network, organized into anatomically distributed sub-circuits, with functionally relevant activity occurring at timescales ranging from milliseconds to months. Current methods to monitor neural activity, however, lack the necessary conjunction of anatomical spatial coverage, temporal resolution, and long-term stability to measure this distributed activity. Here we introduce a large-scale, multi-site recording platform that integrates polymer electrodes with a modular stacking headstage design supporting up to 1024 recording channels in freely behaving rats. This system can support months-long recordings from hundreds of well-isolated units across multiple brain regions. Moreover, these recordings are stable enough to track 25% of single units for over a week. This platform enables large-scale electrophysiological interrogation of the fast dynamics and long-timescale evolution of anatomically distributed circuits, and thereby provides a new tool for understanding brain activity.",

    "abstract": "Feeding is a complex motivated behavior controlled by a distributed neural network that processes sensory information to generate adaptive behavioral responses. Accordingly, studies using appetitive Pavlovian conditioning confirm that environmental cues that are associated with food availability can induce feeding even in satiated subjects. However, in mice, appetitive conditioning generally requires intensive training and thus can impede molecular studies that often require large numbers of animals. To address this, we developed and validated a simple and rapid context-induced feeding (ctx-IF) task in which cues associated with food availability can later lead to increased food consumption in sated mice. We show that the associated increase in food consumption is driven by both positive and negative reinforcement and that spaced training is more effective than massed training. Ctx-IF can be completed in [~]1 week and provides an opportunity to study the molecular mechanisms and circuitry underlying non-homeostatic eating. We have used this paradigm to map brain regions that are activated during Ctx-IF with cFos immunohistochemistry and found that the insular cortex, and other regions, are activated following exposure to cues denoting the availability of food. Finally, we show that inhibition of the insular cortex using GABA agonists impairs performance of the task. Our findings provide a novel assay in mice for defining the functional neuroanatomy of appetitive conditioning and identify specific brain regions that are activated during the development of learned behaviors that impact food consumption.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial genomes evolve in complex ecosystems and are best understood in this natural context, but replicating such conditions in the lab is challenging. We used transposon sequencing to define the fitness consequences of gene disruption in the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus grown in natural freshwater, compared to axenic growth in common laboratory media. Gene disruptions in amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis pathways and in metabolic substrate transport machinery impaired fitness in both lake water and defined minimal medium relative to complex peptone broth. Fitness in lake water was enhanced by insertions in genes required for flagellum biosynthesis and reduced by insertions in genes involved in biosynthesis of the holdfast surface adhesin. We further uncovered numerous hypothetical and uncharacterized genes for which disruption impaired fitness in lake water, defined minimal medium, or both. At the genome scale, the fitness profile of mutants cultivated in lake water was more similar to that in complex peptone broth than in defined minimal medium. Microfiltration of lake water did not significantly affect the terminal cell density or the fitness profile of the transposon mutant pool, suggesting that Caulobacter does not strongly interact with other microbes in this ecosystem on the measured timescale. Fitness of select mutants with defects in cell surface biosynthesis and environmental sensing were significantly more variable in lake water than in defined medium, presumably owing to day-to-day heterogeneity in the lake environment. This study reveals genetic interactions between Caulobacter and a natural freshwater environment, and provides a new avenue to study gene function in complex ecosystems.",

Understanding where these cells fit in the scheme of immunity has been a puzzle since their discovery. Here, immunophenotyping of 101 individuals revealed that these populations account for as much as 25% of peripheral human T cells. To better understand these cells, we generated detailed gene expression profiles using low-input RNA-seq and confirmed key findings through protein-level and functional validation. Unbiased transcriptomic analyses revealed a continuous  innateness gradient with adaptive T cells at one end followed by MAIT, iNKT, V{delta}1+ T, V{delta}2+ T, and natural killer cells at the other end. Innateness was characterized by decreased expression of translational machinery genes and reduced proliferative potential, which allowed for prioritization of effector functions, including rapid cytokine and chemokine production, and cytotoxicity. Thus, global transcriptional programs uncovered rapid proliferation and rapid effector functions as competing goals that respectively define adaptive and innate states.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryAdaptive and innate T cells align along a continuous innateness gradient, reflecting a trade-off between effector function and proliferative capacity.",

Of recent intense interest is the GlycA biomarker, a complex nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy signal reflective of acute and chronic inflammation, which predicts long term risk of diverse outcomes including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality. To systematically explore the specificity of the disease burden indicated by GlycA we analysed the risk for 468 common incident hospitalization and mortality outcomes occurring during an 8-year follow-up of 11,861 adults from Finland. Our analyses of GlycA replicated known associations, identified associations with specific cardiovascular disease outcomes, and uncovered new associations with risk of alcoholic liver disease (meta-analysed hazard ratio 2.94 per 1-SD, P=5x10-6), chronic renal failure (HR=2.47, P=3x10-6), glomerular diseases (HR=1.95, P=1x10-6), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR=1.58, P=3x10-5), inflammatory polyarthropathies (HR=1.46, P=4x10-8), and hypertension (HR=1.21, P=5x10-5). We further evaluated GlycA as a biomarker in secondary prevention of 12-year cardiovascular mortality in 900 angiography patients with suspected coronary artery disease. We observed hazard ratios of 4.87 and 5.00 for 12-year mortality in angiography patients in the fourth and fifth quintiles by GlycA levels demonstrating the prognostic potential of GlycA for identification of high mortality-risk individuals.

    "abstract": "ParA and ParB homologs are involved in accurate chromosome segregation in bacteria. ParBs participate in separation of ori domains by binding to specific parS sites, mainly localized close to oriC. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa neither a lack of parB gene nor modification of ten parSs is lethal. Remarkably, such mutants show not only defects in chromosome segregation but also growth retardation and motility dysfunctions. Moreover, a lack of parB alters expression of over one thousand genes, suggesting that ParB could interact with the chromosome outside its canonical parS targets.\\n\\nIndeed, DNA immunoprecipitation with anti-ParB antibodies followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed 420 enriched regions in WT PAO1161 strain and around 1000 in a ParB-overproducing strain and in various parS mutants. Vast majority of the ParB-enriched loci contained a heptanucleotide motif corresponding to one arm of the parS palindrome. All previously postulated parS sites with the exception of parS5 interacted with ParB in vivo. Whereas the ParB binding to the four parS sites closest to oriC, parS1-4, is involved in chromosome segregation, its genome-wide interactions with hundreds of parS half-sites could affect chromosome topology, compaction and gene expression classifying P. aeruginosa ParB as a Nucleoid Associated Protein (NAP).",

Current endoscopy surveillance for BE patients is probably not cost-effective. Previously, we discovered serum glycoprotein biomarker candidates which could discriminate BE patients from EAC. Here, we aimed to validate candidate serum glycoprotein biomarkers in independent cohorts, and to develop a biomarker panel for BE surveillance.\\n\\nMETHODSSerum glycoprotein biomarker candidates were measured in 301 serum samples collected from Australia (4 states) and USA (1 clinic) using lectin magnetic bead array (LeMBA) coupled multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS). The area under receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated as a measure of discrimination, and multivariate recursive partitioning was used to formulate a multi-marker panel for BE surveillance.\\n\\nRESULTSDifferent glycoforms of complement C9 (C9), gelsolin (GSN), serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1 (PON1) and serum paraoxonase/lactonase 3 (PON3) were validated as diagnostic glycoprotein biomarker candidates for EAC across both cohorts. A panel of 10 serum glycoproteins accurately discriminated BE patients not requiring intervention [BE+/-low grade dysplasia] from those requiring intervention [BE with high grade dysplasia (BE-HGD) or EAC]. Tissue expression of C9 was found to be induced in BE, dysplastic BE and EAC. In longitudinal samples from subjects that have progressed towards EAC, levels of serum C9 glycoforms were increased with disease progression.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSFurther prospective clinical validation of the confirmed biomarker candidates in a large cohort is warranted.

    "abstract": "The SSU Processome (sometimes referred to as 90S) is an early stabile intermediate in the small ribosomal subunit biogenesis pathway of eukaryotes. Progression of the SSU Processome to a pre-40S particle requires a large-scale compaction of the RNA and release of many biogenesis factors. The U3 snoRNA is a primary component of the SSU Processome and hybridizes to the rRNA at multiple locations to organize the structure of the SSU Processome. Thus, release of U3 is prerequisite for the transition to pre-40S. Our lab proposed that the RNA helicase Dhr1 plays a crucial role in the transition by unwinding U3 and that this activity is controlled by the SSU Processome protein Utp14. How Utp14 times the activation of Dhr1 is an open question. Despite being highly conserved, Utp14 contains no recognizable domains, and how Utp14 interacts with the SSU Processome is not well characterized. Here, we used UV crosslinking and analysis of cDNA and yeast two-hybrid interaction to characterize how Utp14 interacts with the pre-ribosome. Moreover, proteomic analysis of SSU particles lacking Utp14 revealed that Utp14 is needed for efficient recruitment of the RNA exosome. Our analysis positions Utp14 to be uniquely poised to communicate the status of assembly of the SSU Processome to Dhr1 and possibly the exosome as well.",

In all eukaryotes, the plasma membrane (PM) is the most electronegative compartment of the cell, which specifies its identity.

Here, we explore which are the lipids that control membrane electrostatics using plants as a model. We show that phosphatidic acidic (PA), phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) are separately required to generate the electrostatic signature of the plant PM. In addition, we reveal the existence of an electrostatic territory that is organized as a gradient along the endocytic pathway and is controlled by PS/PI4P combination. Altogether, we propose that combinatorial lipid composition of the cytosolic leaflet of cellular organelles not only defines the plant electrostatic territory but also distinguishes different compartments within this territory by specifying their varying surface charges.",

Trait validation was carried out through soil coring on a subset of 14 DH lines and the two parents. We observed that drought reduced grain yield per plant by 21.0%.

    "abstract": "Early-life experiences can shape adult behavior, with consequences for fitness and health, yet fundamental questions remain unanswered about how early-life social experiences are translated into variation in brain and behavior. The African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, a model system in social neuroscience, is well known for its highly plastic social phenotypes in adulthood. Here, we rear juveniles in either social groups or pairs to investigate the effects of early-life social environments on behavior and neuroendocrine gene expression. We find that both juvenile behavior and neuroendocrine function are sensitive to early-life effects. Behavior robustly co-varies across multiple contexts (open field, social cue investigation, and dominance behavior assays) to form a behavioral syndrome, with pair-reared juveniles towards the end of syndrome that is less active and socially interactive. Pair-reared juveniles also submit more readily as subordinates. In a separate cohort, we measured whole brain expression of stress and sex hormone genes. Expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) 1a was elevated in group-reared juveniles, supporting a highly-conserved role for the stress axis mediating early-life effects. The effect of rearing environment on androgen receptor (AR)  and estrogen receptor (ER)  expression was mediated by treatment duration (1 vs. 5 weeks). Finally, expression of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and GR2 decreased significantly over time. Rearing environment also caused striking differences in gene co-expression, such that expression was tightly integrated in pair-reared juveniles, but not group-reared or isolates. Together, this research demonstrates the important developmental origins of behavioral phenotypes and identifies potential behavioral and neuroendocrine mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing model of cerebellar learning states that climbing fibers (CFs) are both driven by, and serve to correct, erroneous motor output. However, this model is grounded largely in studies of behaviors that utilize hardwired neural pathways to link sensory input to motor output. To test whether this model applies to more flexible learning regimes that require arbitrary sensorimotor associations, we have developed a cerebellar-dependent motor learning paradigm compatible with both mesoscale and single dendrite resolution calcium imaging in mice. Here, we find that CFs are preferentially driven by and more time-locked to correctly executed movements and other task parameters that predict reward outcome, exhibiting widespread correlated activity within parasagittal processing zones that is governed by these predictions. Together, such CF activity patterns are well-suited to drive learning by providing predictive instructional input consistent with an unsigned reinforcement learning signal that does not rely exclusively on motor errors.",

    "abstract": "Goal directed behavior depends on both sensory mechanisms that gather information from the outside world and decision-making mechanisms that select appropriate behavior based on that sensory information. Psychophysical reverse correlation is commonly used to quantify how fluctuations of sensory stimuli influence behavior and is generally believed to uncover the spatiotemporal weighting functions of sensory processes. Here we show that reverse correlations also reflect decision-making processes and can deviate significantly from the true sensory filters. Specifically, changes of decision bound and mechanisms of evidence integration systematically alter psychophysical reverse correlations. Similarly, trial-to-trial variability of sensory and motor delays and decision times causes systematic distortions in psychophysical kernels that should not be attributed to sensory mechanisms. We show that ignoring details of the decision-making process results in misinterpretation of reverse correlations, but proper use of these details turns reverse correlation into a powerful method for studying both sensory and decision-making mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Visual neuroscientists have long characterized attention as inducing a scaling or additive effect on fixed parametric functions describing neural responses (e.g., contrast response functions). Here, we instead propose that top-down effects are more complex and manifest in ways that depend not only on attention but also other cognitive processes involved in executing a task. To substantiate this theory, we analyze fMRI responses in human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) in a study where stimulus eccentricity and cognitive task are varied. We find that as stimuli are presented farther into the periphery, bottom-up stimulus-driven responses decline but top-down attentional enhancement increases substantially. This disproportionate enhancement of weak responses cannot be easily explained by conventional models of attention. Furthermore, we find that attentional effects depend on the specific cognitive task performed by the subject, indicating the influence of additional cognitive processes other than attention (e.g., decision-making). The effects we observe replicate in an independent experiment from the same study, and also generalize to a separate study involving different stimulus manipulations (contrast and phase coherence). Our results suggest that a quantitative understanding of top-down modulation requires more nuanced and more precise characterization of multiple cognitive factors involved in completing a perceptual task.",

    "abstract": "A popular approach to the study of information processing in the nervous system is to char-acterize neural responses in terms of a cascade of linear and nonlinear stages: a linear filter to describe the neurons stimulus integration properties, followed by a rectifying nonlinearity to convert filter output to spike rate. However, real neurons integrate stimuli via the modula-tion of nonlinear excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances. Here we introduce a bio-physically inspired point process model with conductance-based inputs. The model provides a novel interpretation of the popular Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) as a special kind of conductance-based model, where excitatory and inhibitory conductances are modulated in a \\\"push-pull\\\" manner so that total conductance remains constant. We relax this constraint to obtain a more general and flexible \\\"conductance-based encoding model\\\" (CBEM), which can exhibit stimulus-dependent fluctuations in gain and dynamics. We fit the model to spike trains of macaque retinal ganglion cells and show that, remarkably, we can accurately infer underlying inhibitory and excitatory conductances, using comparisons to intracellularly measured conductances. Using extracellular data, we corroborate the intracellular finding that synaptic excitation temporally precedes inhibition in retina. We show that the CBEM outperforms the classic GLM at predicting retinal ganglion cell responses to full-field stimuli, generalizes better across contrast levels, and captures inhibition-dependent response properties to spatially structured stimuli. The CBEM provides a powerful tool for gaining insights into the intracellular variables governing spiking, and forges an important link between extracellular characterization methods and biophysically detailed response models.",

Surprisingly, very little is known about the morphological transition and cellular dynamics during somite differentiation. Here, we address this by examining cellular rearrangements and morphogenesis in differentiating somites using live multi photon imaging of GFP-transgenic chick embryos. We specifically focussed on the dynamic changes in two principle regions within the somite (the medial and lateral domains) to investigate extensive morphological changes. Furthermore, by using quantitative analysis and cell tracking, we were able to capture for the first time a progenitor cell bulk movement towards the rostral-medial domain of the myotome, where skeletal muscle formation first initiates.",

    "abstract": "In temperate regions, slope aspect is one of the most influential drivers of environmental conditions at landscape level. The effect of aspect on vegetation has been well studied, but virtually nothing is known about how fungal communities are shaped by aspect-driven environmental conditions. I carried out DNA metabarcoding of fungi from soil samples taken in a selected study area of Pannonian forests to compare richness and community composition of taxonomic and functional groups of fungi between slopes of predominantly southerly vs. northerly aspect and to assess the influence of selected environmental variables on fungal community composition. The deep sequence data presented here (i.e. 980 766 quality-filtered sequences) indicate that both niche (environmental filtering) and neutral (stochastic) processes shape fungal community composition at landscape level. Fungal community composition correlated strongly with aspect, with many fungi showing preference for either south-facing or north-facing slopes. Several taxonomic and functional groups showed significant differences in richness between north-and south-facing slopes and strong compositional differences were observed in all functional groups. The effect of aspect on fungal communities likely is mediated through contrasting mesoclimatic conditions, that in turn influence edaphic processes as well as vegetation. Finally, the data presented here provide an unprecedented insight into the diversity and landscape-level community dynamics of fungi in the Pannonian forests.",

Despite many decades of using radio-telemetry to track animals and make spatial inference, there are few statistical options to handle these unique data and no synthetic framework for modeling animal location uncertainty and accounting for it in ecological models. We describe a novel azimuthal telemetry model (ATM) to account for azimuthal uncertainty with covariates and propagate location uncertainty into ecological models. We evaluate the ATM with commonly used estimators in several study design scenarios using simulation. We also provide illustra-tive empirical examples, demonstrating the impact of ignoring location uncertainty within home range and resource selection analyses. We found the ATM to have good performance and the only model that has appropriate measures of coverage. Ignoring animal location un-certainty when estimating resource selection or home ranges can have pernicious effects on ecological inference. We demonstrate that home range estimates can be overly confident and conservative when ignoring location uncertainty and resource selection coefficients can lead to incorrect inference and over confidence in the magnitude of selection. Our findings and model development have important implications for interpreting historical analyses using this type of data and the future design of radio-telemetry studies.",

    "abstract": "Control of Streptococcus pneumoniae colonisation at human mucosal surfaces is critical to reducing the burden of pneumonia and invasive disease, interrupting onward transmission, and in achieving herd protection. We hypothesised that the pattern of pneumococcal-epithelial engagement dictates the inflammatory response to colonisation, and that this epithelial sensing is linked to bacterial clearance. Here we have used nasal curette biopsies from a serotype 6B Experimental Human Pneumococcal Carriage Model (EHPC) to visualize S. pneumoniae colonisation and relate these interactions to epithelial surface marker expression and transcriptomic profile upregulation. We have used a Detroit 562 cell co-culture model to further understand these processes and develop an integrated epithelial transcriptomic module to interrogate gene expression in the EHPC model. We have shown for the first time that pneumococcal colonisation in humans is characterised by microcolony formation at the epithelial surface, microinvasion, cell junction protein association, epithelial sensing, and both epithelial endocytosis and paracellular transmigration. Comparisons with other clinical strains in vitro has revealed that the degree of pneumococcal epithelial surface adherence and microinvasion determines the host cell surface marker expression (ICAM-1 and CD107), cytokine production (IL-6, IL-8 and ICAM-1) and the transcriptomic response. In the context of retained barrier function, epithelial microinvasion is associated with the upregulation of a wide range of epithelial innate signalling and regulatory pathways, inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, cellular metabolism and stress response genes. The prominence of epithelial TLR4R signalling pathways implicates pneumolysin, a key virulence factor, but although pneumolysin gene deletion partially ameliorates the inflammatory transcriptional response in vitro, critical inflammatory pathways persist in association with enhanced epithelial adhesion and microinvasion. Importantly, the pattern of the host-bacterial interaction seen with the 6B strain in vitro is also reflected in the EHPC model, with evidence of microinvasion and a relatively silent epithelial transcriptomic profile that becomes most prominent around the time of bacterial clearance. Together these data suggest that epithelial sensing of the pneumococcus during colonisation in humans is enhanced by microinvasion, resulting in innate epithelial responses that are associated with bacterial clearance.\\n\\nHighlights\\n\\nO_LIColonisation of the human mucosa by Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with microcolony formation, microinvasion, epithelial sensing and an epithelial innate response.\\nC_LIO_LIFollowing adherence to the epithelial cell surface, microinvasion of the epithelium may occur by endocytosis and/or lateral migration between cells without necessarily compromising barrier integrity.\\nC_LIO_LIThe pattern of pneumococcal epithelial surface adherence and microinvasion determines the host cell response through a range of innate signaling and regulatory pathways, inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, cellular metabolism and stress response genes.\\nC_LIO_LIEpithelial sensing is triggered by, but not wholly dependent on pneumolysin, a key virulence factor of S. pneumoniae.\\nC_LI",

Buspirone, a partial serotonin receptor agonist (5-HT1A), was recently shown to facilitate and even trigger locomotor movements in mice after complete spinal lesion (Tx). Here, we studied its effect on the H-reflex after acute Tx in adult mice. To avoid possible impacts of anesthetics on H-reflex depression, experiments were performed after decerebration in un-anesthetized mice (N=13). The H-reflex in plantar muscles of the hind-paw was recorded after tibial nerve stimulation 2 h after Tx at the 8th thoracic vertebrae. Average H/M ratio was compared before and every 10 min after buspirone (8 mg/kg, i.p.) for 60 min. Frequency-dependent depression (FDD) of the H-reflex was assessed before and 50 min after buspirone. Before buspirone, a stable H-reflex could be elicited in acute spinal mice and FDD of the H-reflex was observed at 5Hz (68%) and 10Hz (70%) relative to 0.2Hz. After buspirone, the H/M ratio was initially significantly decreased to 69% of pre-treatment. It then increased significantly 30 to 60 min after exposure to buspirone, reaching 170% 60 min after injection. FDD 50 min after buspirone was not significantly different that FDD without treatment. Altogether results suggest that the reported pro-locomotor effect of buspirone occurs at a time where there is a reflex depression followed by a second phase marked by enhancement of reflex excitability, denoting functional inhibitory control.\\n\\nKEY POINTS SUMMARYO_LIBuspirone, a partial serotoninergic agonist (5HT1A), exerts a considerable acute facilitation of spinally-mediated locomotion after a complete spinal lesion in mice.\\nC_LIO_LISince locomotion is associated with reflex modulation, we focused in this study on the effect of buspirone on H-reflex in acute spinal mice after decerebration and removal of anesthesia.\\nC_LIO_LIBuspirone injection resulted in a depression of the H-reflex during the first 20 minutes followed, 40 minutes later, by an increase of the reflex.\\nC_LIO_LIThe H-reflex increase is not due to a disinhibition since buspirone had no effect on the frequency dependent depression (FDD) of the H-reflex.\\nC_LIO_LIThe use of a model of adult decerebrate mouse with complete spinal cord injury allows to establish that buspirone has a biphasic effect on the H-reflex and that the inhibitory action on sensory information concurs with an excitatory action on locomotion.\\nC_LI\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "The versatility of the current DNA sequencing platforms and the development of portable, nanopore sequencers means that it has never been easier to collect genetic data for unknown sample ID. DNA barcoding and meta-barcoding have become increasingly popular and barcode databases continue to grow at an impressive rate. However, the number of canonical genome assemblies (reference or draft) that are publically available is relatively tiny, hindering the more widespread use of genome scale DNA sequencing technology for accurate species identification and discovery. Here, we show that rapid raw-read reference datasets, or R4IDs for short, generated in a matter of hours on the Oxford Nanopore MinION, can bridge this gap and accelerate the generation of useable reference sequence data. By exploiting the long read length of this technology, shotgun genomic sequencing of a small portion of an organisms genome can act as a suitable reference database despite the low sequencing coverage. These R4IDs can then be used for accurate species identification with minimal amounts of re-sequencing effort (1000s of reads). We demonstrated the capabilities of this approach with six vascular plant species for which we created R4IDs in the laboratory and then re-sequenced, live at the Kew Science Festival 2016. We further validated our method using simulations to determine the broader applicability of the approach.

The original Nam models were extended to consider interactions between cancer and normal cells using an approach developed for representing host-microbe interactions. When uptake ratio of only single reaction was allowed to change at a time, the results of computational experiments showed that every essential amino acid had effective ranges for almost all nine types of cancer, while the other uptake reactions rarely had such effective ranges.",

    "abstract": "It is now generally accepted that cyanobacteria are responsible for production of oxygen, which led to the so-called \\\"Great Oxygenation Event\\\". Appearance of dioxygen in Earths atmosphere resulted in formation of the ozone layer and the ionosphere, which caused significant reduction of ionizing radiation levels at the surface of our planet. This event not only increased biological diversity but also canceled the urgency of previously developed mechanisms of DNA protection, which allowed to survive and develop in harsh environmental conditions including exposure to cosmic rays. In order to test the hypothesis if one of the oldest organisms on Earth retained ancient protection mechanisms, we studied the effect of ionizing radiation (IoR, here: -particles with a kinetic energy of about 30 MeV) and space flight during the mission of the Foton-M4 satellite on cells of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. By analyzing spectral and functional characteristics of photosynthetic membranes we revealed numerous similarities between cells exposed to IoR and after the space mission. In both cases, we found that excitation energy transfer from phycobilisomes to photosystems was interrupted and the concentration of phycobiliproteins was significantly reduced. Although photosynthetic activity was severely suppressed, the effect was reversible and the cells were able to rapidly recover from stress under normal conditions. Moreover, in vitro experiments demonstrated that the effect of IoR on isolated phycobilisomes was completely different from such in vivo. These observations suggest that the actual existence and the uncoupling of phycobilisomes under irradiation stress could play specific role not only in photo-, but also in radioprotection, which was crucial for early stages of evolution and the development of Life on Earth.",

    "abstract": "In the metagenomics studies, testing the association of microbiome composition and clinical conditions translates to testing the nullity of variance components. Computationally efficient score tests have been the major tools. But they can only apply to the null hypothesis with a single variance component and when sample sizes are large. Therefore, they are not applicable to longitudinal microbiome studies. In this paper, we propose exact tests (score test, likelihood ratio test, and restricted likelihood ratio test) to solve the problems of (1) testing the association of the overall microbiome composition in a longitudinal design and (2) detecting the association of one specific microbiome cluster while adjusting for the effects from related clusters. Our approach combines the exact tests for null hypothesis with a single variance component with a strategy of reducing multiple variance components to a single one. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method has correct type I error rate and superior power compared to existing methods at small sample sizes and weak signals. Finally, we apply our method to a longitudinal pulmonary microbiome study of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients and reveal two interesting genera Prevotella and Veillonella associated with forced vital capacity. Our findings shed lights on the impact of lung microbiome to HIV complexities.

To demonstrate that these calls can be used for accurate benchmarking, we compare other high-quality callsets to ours (e.g., Illumina Platinum Genomes), and we demonstrate that the majority of discordant calls are errors in the other callsets, We also highlight challenges in interpreting performance metrics when benchmarking against imperfect high-confidence calls.

The Black-fronted Piping-guan (Aburria jacutinga) is an endangered Neotropical bird of the Cracidae (Galliformes) going through a reintroduction program to avoid extinction. We used microscopic examination and partial cytochrome b DNA sequencing to describe a new Haemoproteus species infecting Black-fronted Piping-guans bred and raised in captivity that were reintroduced into the Atlantic rainforest. Haemoproteus (Parahaemoproteus) paraortalidum n. sp. was detected in the blood of 19 out of 29 examined birds. The new species is distinguished from other haemoproteids due to the shape of gametocytes, which have pointed ends in young stages, and due to the presence of vacuole-like unstained spaces in macrogametocytes and numerous volutin granules both in macro- and microgametocytes. Illustrations of the new species are provided. Phylogenetic inference positioned this parasite in the Parahaemoproteus subgenus clade together with the other two Haemoproteus genetic lineages detected in cracids up to date. We discuss possible implications of the reintroduction of birds infected with haemosporidian parasites into de wild. Treatment of Haemoproteus infections remains insufficiently studied, but should be considered for infected birds before reintroduction to improve host reproductive and survival rates after release.",

    "abstract": "The use of Navigation Assistance Systems for spatial orienting has become increasingly popular. Such automated navigation support, however, comes with a reduced processing of the surrounding environment and often with a decline of spatial orienting ability. To prevent such deskilling and to support spatial learning, the present study investigated incidental spatial learning by comparing standard navigation instructions with two modified navigation instruction conditions. The first modified instruction condition highlighted landmarks and provided additional redundant information regarding the landmark (contrast condition), while the second highlighted landmarks and included personal relevant information regarding the landmark (personal-reference condition). Participants spatial knowledge of the previously unknown virtual city was tested three weeks later. Behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) data demonstrated enhanced memory performance for participants in the modified navigation instruction conditions without further differentiating between modified instructions. Recognition performance of landmarks was better and the late positive complex of the event-related potential (ERP) revealed amplitude differences reflecting an increased amount of recollected information for modified navigation instructions. The results indicate a significant long-term spatial learning effect when landmarks are highlighted during navigation instructions.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are strongly modulated both by stimulus contrast and by fluctuations of internal inputs. An important question is whether population codes are preserved under these conditions. Changes in stimulus contrast are thought to leave population codes invariant, whereas the effect of internal gain modulations remains unknown. To address these questions we studied how the direction-of-motion of oriented gratings is encoded in layer 2/3 of mouse V1. Surprisingly, we found that, because contrast gain responses across cells are heterogeneous, a change in contrast alters the information distribution profile across cells leading to the failure of contrast invariance. Remarkably, internal input fluctuations that cause commensurate firing rate modulations at the single-cell level, do respect population code invariance. These observations have important implications for visual information encoding, and argue that the brain strives to maintain the stability of the neural code in the face of fluctuating internal inputs.",

    "abstract": "In studies of human episodic memory, the phenomenon of reactivation has traditionally been observed in regions of occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) involved in sensory experience. However, reactivation also occurs in lateral parietal cortex (LPC), and recent evidence indicates that reactivation of stimulus-specific information may be stronger in LPC than in OTC. These observations raise a number of questions about the nature of memory representations in LPC and their relation to representations in OTC. Here, we report two fMRI experiments that quantify stimulus feature information (color and object category) within LPC and OTC, separately during perception and memory retrieval, in male and female human subjects. Across both experiments, we show a clear dissociation between OTC and LPC: while feature information in OTC is relatively stronger during perception than memory, feature information in LPC is relatively stronger during memory than perception. Thus, while OTC and LPC represent common stimulus features, they preferentially represent this information during different stages. We show that this transformation of feature information across regions co-occurs with stimulus-level reinstatement within LPC and high-level OTC. In Experiment 2, we consider whether feature information in LPC during memory retrieval is flexibly and dynamically shaped by top-down goals. Indeed, we find that dorsal LPC preferentially represents retrieved feature information that addresses current goals. In contrast, ventral LPC represents retrieved features independent of current goals. Collectively, these findings provide insight into the nature and significance of mnemonic representations in LPC and constitute an important bridge between putative mnemonic and control functions of parietal cortex.",

Although studies have reported that various neuropsychiatric disorders exhibit abnormalities in R-fMRI measures, these \\\"biomarkers\\\" have not been validated in differentiating structural lesions (brain tumors) as a concept proof. We enrolled 60 patients with intracranial tumors located in the unilateral cranial cavity and 60 matched normal controls to test whether R-fMRI indices can differentiate tumors, which represents a prerequisite for adapting such indices as biomarkers for neuropsychiatric disorders. Common R-fMRI indices of tumors and their counterpart control regions, which were defined as the contralateral normal areas (for amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo) and degree centrality (DC)) and ipsilateral regions surrounding the tumors (for voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC)), were comprehensively assessed. According to paired t-tests with a Bonferroni correction, only ALFF (both with and without Z-standardization) and VMHC (Fishers r-to-z transformed) could successfully differentiate substantial tumors from their counterpart normal regions in patients. And DC was not able to differentiate tumor from normal unless employed Z-standardization. To validate the lower power in the between-subject design than in the within-subject design, each metric was calculated in a matched control group, and two-sample t-tests were used to compare the patient tumors and the normal controls at the same area. Only ALFF (and that with Z-standardization) along with VMHC succeeded in differentiating significant differences between tumors and the sham tumors areas of normal controls. This study tested the premise of R-fMRI biomarkers for differentiating lesions, and brings a new understanding to physical significance of the Z-standardization.",

Unfortunately, testing of this idea has been hampered by a lack of objective, generalizable methods for measuring the structural complexity of real-world behaviors. Here we present a data-driven approach for quantifying hierarchical structure by extracting action grammars from basic ethograms. We apply this method to the evolutionarily-relevant behavior of stone tool-making by comparing sequences from the experimental replication of {small tilde}2.5 Mya Oldowan vs. more recent {small tilde}0.5 Mya Achuelean tools. Results show that, while using the same \\\"alphabet\\\" of elementary actions, Acheulean sequences are structurally more complex. Beyond its specific evolutionary implications, this finding illustrates the broader applicability of our method to investigate the structure of naturalistic human behaviors and cognition. We demonstrate one application by using our complexity measures to re-analyze data from an fMRI study of tool-making action observation.",

    "abstract": "Most organisms possess an ability to differentiate unexpected or surprising sensory stimuli from those that are repeatedly encountered. How is this sensory computation performed? We examined this issue in the locust olfactory system. We found that odor-evoked responses in the antennal lobe (downstream to sensory neurons) systematically reduced upon repeated encounters of a temporally discontinuous stimulus. Rather than confounding information about stimulus identity and intensity, neural representations were optimized to encode equivalent stimulus-specific information with fewer spikes. Further, spontaneous activity of the antennal lobe network also changed systematically and became negatively correlated with the response elicited by the repetitive stimulus (i.e.  a negative image). Notably, while response to the repetitive stimulus reduced, exposure to an unexpected/deviant cue generated undamped and even exaggerated spiking responses in several neurons. In sum, our results reveal how expectation regarding a stimulus is encoded in a neural circuit to allow response optimization and preferential filtering.",

The results showed that CEPA significantly repressed the vegetative growth attributed to the increase of the ABA and ZT synthesis, and the decrease of IAA synthesis in leaves and buds. However, there was no significant difference or significant inverse effect between 1-MCP and control. Furthermore, CEPA promoted flower formation, increased the flowering rate and advanced the blossom period for 2 days compared with the control, which accompanied by the accumulation of soluble sugar, glucose and sucrose, and the increase of -amylase (-AMY) and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activities, and the decrease of the starch contents and sucrose synthase (SS) activities in leaves and buds. However, the blossom period was delayed for 2 days after spraying with 1-MCP. Finally, the expression of TFL1 was significantly repressed while the AP1 was significantly promoted in buds from M.26 and M.26/M. sieversii after spraying with CEPA, while the effect was not significant from M. sieversii. However, the expression levels of TFL1 and AP1 were not significantly different from the control after the application of 1-MCP. In spite of this, CEPA was more susceptible to easy-flowering M26, followed by M26/M. sieversii, and still less susceptible to difficult-flowering rootstock M. sieversii.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

Available optimization interfaces rarely simultaneously allow customizations by the programmer and the capacity for the biologist to perform simulations or optimizations with a simple interface.\\n\\nHere, we provide the C++ code of a graphical user interface based on a user defined minimal C++ ODE model class.

Moonfit is powerful enough to fit and compare models with high dimensionality, multiple datasets, to automatize optimizations, and to perform iterative fittings using data interpolation.

Metabolism of L-arginine by the enzyme arginase has been found to be associated with cancer cell proliferation. Arginase inhibition has been proposed as a potential therapeutic means to inhibit this process. N-hydroxy-nor-L-Arg (nor-NOHA) and N (omega)-hydroxy-L-arginine (NOHA) has shown promise in inhibiting cancer progression through arginase inhibition. In this study, nor-NOHA and NOHA-associated genes and proteins were analyzed with several Bioinformatics and Systems Biology tools to identify the associated pathways and the key players involved so that a more comprehensive view of the molecular mechanisms including the regulatory mechanisms can be achieved and more potential targets for treatment of cancer can be discovered. Based on the analyses carried out, 3 significant modules have been identified from the PPI network. Five pathways/processes have been found to be significantly associated with nor-NOHA and NOHA associated genes. Out of the 1996 proteins in the PPI network, 4 have been identified as hub proteins-SOD, SOD1, AMD1, and NOS2. These 4 proteins have been implicated in cancer by other studies. Thus, this study provided further validation into the claim of these 4 proteins being potential targets for cancer treatment.",

Understanding the principles behind morphogen distribution and how cells interpret locally this information remains a major challenge in developmental biology. Here we introduce morphogen-age measurements as a novel approach to retrieve key parameters in morphogen dynamics. Using a tandem fluorescent timer (tFT) as a protein-age sensor we find a gradient of increasing age of Bicoid (Bcd) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis in the early Drosophila embryo. Quantitative analysis retrieves parameter that are most consistent with the synthesis-diffusion-degradation (SDD) model underlying Bcd-gradient formation, and rule out some other hypotheses for gradient formation. Moreover, we show that the timer can detect transitions in the dynamics associated with syncytial cellularization. Our results provide new insight into Bcd gradient formation, and demonstrate how morphogen age-information can complement knowledge about movement, abundance and distribution, which should be widely applicable for other systems.",

In Caenorhabditis elegans, almost all piRNA loci are found within two 3Mb clusters on Chromosome IV. Each piRNA locus possesses an upstream motif that recruits RNA polymerase II to produce a [~]28 nt precursor transcript. Here, we use comparative epigenomics across nematodes to gain insight into piRNA biogenesis. We show that the piRNA upstream motif is derived from core promoter elements controlling snRNA biogenesis. We describe two alternative modes of piRNA organisation in nematodes: in C. elegans and closely related nematodes, piRNAs are clustered within repressive H3K27me3 chromatin, whilst in other species, typified by Pristionchus pacificus, piRNAs are distributed genome-wide within introns of actively transcribed genes. In both groups, piRNA production depends on downstream sequence signals associated with RNA polymerase II pausing, which synergise with the chromatin environment to control piRNA precursor transcription.",

    "abstract": "The control of joint stiffness is a fundamental mechanism used to control human movements. While many studies have observed how stiffness is controlled for tasks involving shoulder and elbow motion, a limited amount of knowledge is available for wrist movements, though the wrist plays a crucial role in fine manipulation.\\n\\nWe have developed a computational framework based on a realistic musculoskeletal model, which allows to calculate the passive and active components of the wrist joint stiffness. We first used the framework to validate the musculoskeletal model against experimental measurements of the passive wrist joint stiffness, and then to study the contribution of different muscle groups on the passive joint stiffness. We finally used the framework to study the effect of muscle co - contraction on the active joint stiffness.\\n\\nThe results show that thumb and finger muscles play a crucial role in determining the passive wrist joint stiff - ness: in the neutral posture, the direction of maximum stiffness aligns with the experimental measurements, and the magnitude increases by 113% when they are included. Moreover, the analysis of the controllability of joint stiffness showed that muscle co - contraction positively correlates with the stiffness magnitude and negatively correlates with the variability of the stiffness orientation (p < 0.01 in both cases). Finally, an exhaustive search showed that with appropriate selection of a muscle activation strategy, the joint stiffness orientation can be arbitrarily modulated. This observation suggests the absence of biomechanical constraints on the controllability of the orientation of the wrist joint stiffness.",

Genomes of 48 O2MA lines and their progenitors were sequenced. There is significant variation among O2MA lines in base-substitution rate ({micro}bs), but no effect of initial fitness, whereas the indel rate is greater in high-fitness O2MA lines. Overall, {micro}bs is positively correlated with recombination and proximity to short tandem repeats and negatively correlated with 10 bp and 1 Kb GC content.

These observations suggest ESCRT-IIIs are recruited by a combination of membrane curvature and the late domains of the HIV-1 Gag protein. ESCRT-IIIs may pull the neck into a narrower form but must leave to allow scission. If scission does not occur within minutes of ESCRT departure, ESCRT-III and VPS4 are recruited again.

Then we empirically tested the GCTA and LDAK Models on GWAS data for a wide variety of complex traits. We found that the LDAK Model fits real data both significantly and substantially better than the GCTA Model, indicating that LDAK estimates more accurately describe the genetic architecture of complex traits than those from GCTA or LDSC.\\n\\nSome of our most striking results were our revised estimates of functional enrichments (the heritability enrichments of SNP categories defined by functional annotations). In general, estimates from LDAK were substantially more modest than previous estimates based on the GCTA Model. For example, we estimated that DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) were 1.4-fold (SD 0.1) enriched, whereas a study using GCTA had found they were 5.1-fold (SD 0.5) enriched,5 and we estimated that conserved SNPs were 1.3-fold (SD 0.3) enriched, whereas a study using S-LDSC (stratified LDSC) had found they were 13.3-fold (SD 1.5) enriched.6\\n\\nIn their correspondence, Gazal et al. dispute our findings. They assert that the heritability model assumed by LDSC is more realistic than the LDAK Model, and that estimates of enrichment from S-LDSC7 are more accurate than those from LDAK. Here, we explain why their justification for preferring the model used by LDSC is incorrect, and provide a simple demonstration that S-LDSC produces unreliable estimates of enrichment.",

    "abstract": "A technology to record membrane potential from multiple neurons, simultaneously, in behaving animals will have a transformative impact on neuroscience research1. Parallel recordings could reveal the subthreshold potentials and intercellular correlations that underlie network behavior2. Paired stimulation and recording can further reveal the input-output properties of individual cells or networks in the context of different brain states3. Genetically encoded voltage indicators are a promising tool for these purposes, but were so far limited to single-cell recordings with marginal signal to noise ratio (SNR) in vivo4-6. We developed improved near infrared voltage indicators, high speed microscopes and targeted gene expression schemes which enabled recordings of supra- and subthreshold voltage dynamics from multiple neurons simultaneously in mouse hippocampus, in vivo. The reporters revealed sub-cellular details of back-propagating action potentials, correlations in sub-threshold voltage between multiple cells, and changes in dynamics associated with transitions from resting to locomotion. In combination with optogenetic stimulation, the reporters revealed brain state-dependent changes in neuronal excitability, reflecting the interplay of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. These tools open the possibility for detailed explorations of network dynamics in the context of behavior.",

    "abstract": "Neural crest stem cells (NCPCs) have been shown to differentiate into various cell types and tissues during embryonic development, including sensory neurons. The few studies addressing the generation of NCPCs and peripheral sensory neurons (PSNs) from human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSCs), generated sensory cells without displaying robust activity. Here, we describe an efficient strategy for hiPSCs differentiation into NCPCs and functional PSNs using chemically defined media and factors to achieve efficient differentiation, confirmed by the expression of specific markers. After 10 days hiPSCs differentiated into NCPCs, cells were then maintained in neural induction medium containing defined growth factors for PSNs differentiation, followed by 10 days in neonatal human epidermal keratinocytes-(HEKn-) conditioned medium. We observed a further increase in PSN markers expression and neurites length after conditioned medium treatment. The resulting neurons released substance P (SP) in response to nociceptive agents such as anandamide and resiniferatoxin. Anandamide induced substance P release via activation of TRPV1 and not CB1. Transcriptomic analysis of the PSNs revealed the main dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neuronal markers and a transcriptional profile compatible with C-LTMR. TRPV1 was detected by immunofluorescence and RNA-Seq in multiple experiments. In conclusion, the developed strategy generated PSNs useful for drug screening that could be applied to patient-derived hiPSCs, consisting in a powerful tool to model human diseases in vitro.",

Infestation in Puita INTA-CL cultivar reduced the number of seeds/plant, percentage of full seeds, 1,000 seeds weight, and seed length, whereas infestation in IRGA423 increased 1,000 seeds weight and seed length. Reduction in seed weight/plant caused by infestation was higher in Puita INTA-CL than IRGA423. Thus, Puita INTA-CL was established as susceptible, and IRGA423 as tolerant to S. oryzae infestation. Photosynthetic parameters were less affected by infestation in IRGA423 than in Puita INTA-CL. Infestation also caused accumulation of H2O2, decreased cell membrane integrity and accelerated senescence in leaves of Puita INTA-CL, while leaves of IRGA423 presented higher levels of phenolics compounds. Using proteomic analysis, we identified proteins related to plant defense, such as jasmonate synthesis, and related to other mechanisms of tolerance such as oxidative stress, photosynthesis, and DNA structure maintenance, more abundant in IRGA423 after seven days of infestation. We detected higher levels of silicon (as amorphous silica cells) in leaves of infested IRGA423 plants compared to Puita INTA-CL, an element previously linked to plant defense. Our data shows that IRGA423 presents tolerance to S. oryzae infestation, and that multiple mechanisms might be employed by this cultivar.\\n\\nHighlightThis is the first report evaluating the defense responses (tolerance and susceptiblity) of two contrasting rice cultivars to Schizotetranychus oryzae mite infestation.",

However, most existing tools that implement FBA require downloading software and writing code. Furthermore, FBA generates predictions for metabolic networks with thousands of components, so meaningful changes in FBA solutions can be difficult to identify. These challenges make it difficult for beginners to learn how FBA works.\\n\\nResultsTo meet this need, we present Escher-FBA, a web application for interactive FBA simulations within a pathway visualization. Escher-FBA allows users to set flux bounds, knock out reactions, change objective functions, upload metabolic models, and generate high-quality figures without downloading software or writing code. We provide detailed instructions on how to use Escher-FBA to replicate several FBA simulations that generate real scientific hypotheses.\\n\\nConclusionsWe designed Escher-FBA to be as intuitive as possible so that users can quickly and easily understand the core concepts of FBA.

When the CM was applied to tumor cells, the exosomes were internalized by recipient tumor cells and in the presence of the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) effectively triggered dose-dependent tumor cell death by endocytosed exosomes via an intracellular conversion of the prodrug 5-FC to 5-fluorouracil. Exosomes were found to be responsible for the tumor inhibitory activity. MSCs transduced with the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene released exosomes causing death of tumor cells in the presence of ganciclovir. The presence of microRNAs in exosomes produced from naive MSCs and corresponding transgene transduced MSCs did not differ significantly. microRNAs from yCD::UPRT-MSCs were not associated with therapeutic effect.

Such research is contingent on accurate annotation of transcription start sites (TSSs). However, comprehensive genome-wide maps of TSSs and their usage across commonly applied laboratory conditions and treatments for S. pombe are lacking. To this end, we profiled TSS activity genome-wide in S. pombe cultures exposed to heat shock, nitrogen starvation, hydrogen peroxide and two commonly applied media, YES and EMM2, using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE). CAGE-based annotation of TSSs is substantially more accurate than existing PomBase annotation; on average, CAGE TSSs fall 50-75 bp downstream of PomBase TSSs and co-localize with nucleosome boundaries. In contrast to higher eukaryotes, S. pombe does not show sharp and dispersed TSS distributions. Our data recapitulate known S. pombe stress expression response patterns and identify stress- and mediaresponsive alternative TSSs. Notably, alteration of growth medium induces changes of similar magnitude as some stressors. We show a link between nucleosome occupancy and genetic variation, and that the proximal promoter region is genetically diverse between S. pombe strains. Our detailed TSS map constitute a central resource for S. pombe gene regulation research.",

    "abstract": "We describe a novel biogenesis factor of the 90S pre-ribosome, Puf-A, which is a negative transcriptional target of p53. The expression of Puf-A is not only upregulated in advanced human lung cancer and tumors of patients especially with TP53 mutation, but also is highly prognostic for stage I lung cancer. Loss of Puf-A expression prevents KrasG12D/p53-/--induced tumor progression in the lungs and induces apoptosis in TP53- mutated cancers and c-Myc/p53-/--transformed cells as well. Overexpression of Puf-A enhances proliferation of normal cells after c-Myc induction and overcomes the cell-cycle checkpoints incurred by p53 expression. Mechanistically, Puf-A interacts with double-stranded structures of the 5.8S sequence within pre-rRNA and maintains the integrity of 90S pre-ribosomes, thereby impacting early ribosome assembly and export of ribosomes from nuclei. Silencing of Puf-A disrupts the assembly of 90S pre-ribosomes and induces the translocation of its associated nucleophosmin (NPM1) from nucleoli to the nucleoplasm, resulting in impairment of ribosome synthesis. Thus, Puf-A is crucial for over-activation of ribosome biogenesis and contributes to tumor progression and cancer growth.",

Ciliate mitochondrial genomes exhibit a unique combination of characteristics, including a linear organization and the presence of multiple genes with no known function or detectable homologs in other eukaryotes. Here we study the variation of ciliate mitochondrial genomes both within and across thirteen highly diverged Paramecium species, including multiple species from the P. aurelia species complex, with four outgroup species: P. caudatum, P. multimicronucleatum, and two strains that may represent novel related species. We observe extraordinary conservation of gene order and protein-coding content in Paramecium mitochondria across species. In contrast, significant differences are observed in tRNA content and copy number, which is highly conserved in species belonging to the P. aurelia complex but variable among and even within the other Paramecium species. There is an increase in GC content from ~20% to ~40% on the branch leading to the P. aurelia complex. Patterns of polymorphism in population-genomic data and mutation-accumulation experiments suggest that the increase in GC content is primarily due to changes in the mutation spectra in the P. aurelia species. Finally, we find no evidence of recombination in Paramecium mitochondria and find that the mitochondrial genome appears to experience either similar or stronger efficacy of purifying selection than the nucleus.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of cell integrity and cell-to-cell communication are fundamental biological processes. Filamentous fungi, such as Neurospora crassa, depend on communication to locate compatible cells, coordinate cell fusion, and establish a robust hyphal network. Two MAP-Kinase pathways are essential for communication and cell fusion in N. crassa; the Cell Wall Integrity/MAK-1 pathway and the MAK-2 (signal response) pathway. Previous studies have demonstrated several points of cross talk between the MAK-1 and MAK-2 pathways, which is likely necessary for oordinating chemotropic growth toward an extracellular signal, and then mediating cell fusion. Canonical MAP-Kinase pathways begin with signal reception and end with a transcriptional response. Two transcription factors, ADV-1 and PP-1, are essential for communication and cell fusion. PP-1 is the conserved target of MAK-2, while it is unclear what targets ADV-1. We did RNAseq on{Delta} adv-1, {Delta}pp-1, and wild-type cells and found that ADV-1 and PP-1 have a shared regulon including many genes required for communication, cell fusion, growth, development, and stress response. We identified ADV-1 and PP-1 binding sites across the genome by adapting the in vitro method of DNA-Affinity Purification sequencing (DAP-seq) for N. crassa. To elucidate the regulatory network, we misexpressed each transcription factor in each upstream MAPK deletion mutant. Misexpression of adv-1 was sufficient to fully suppress the phenotype of the{Delta} pp-1 mutant and partially suppress the phenotype of the{Delta} mak-1 mutant. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the MAK-1-ADV-1 and MAK-2- PP-1 pathways form a tight regulatory network that maintains cell integrity and mediates communication and cell fusion.",

In this study, we applied DNA metabarcoding to dental calculus of Edo people for the taxonomic identification of food species.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods: DNA was extracted from 13 human dental calculi from the Unko-in site (18th-19th century) of the Edo period, Japan. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were performed using a primer set specific to the genus Oryza, because rice (Oryza sativa) was a staple food and this was the only member of this genus present in Japan at that time. DNA metabarcoding targeting plants, animals (meat and fish), and fungi was also carried out to investigate dietary diversity.\\n\\nResults: We detected amplified products of the genus Oryza from more than half of the samples using PCR and Sanger sequencing. DNA metabarcoding enabled us to identify taxa of plants and fungi, although taxa of animals were not detected, except human.\\n\\nDiscussion: Most of the plant taxonomic groups are present in Japan and include species consumed as food at that time, as confirmed by historical literature. The other groups featured in the lifestyle of Edo people, such as for medicinal purposes and tobacco. The results indicate that plant DNA analysis from calculus provides information about food diversity and lifestyle habits from the past and can complement other analytical methods such as starch analysis and stable isotope analysis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUric acid is the final product of purine metabolism and elevated serum urate levels can cause gout. Conflicting results were reported for the effect of PKD2 on serum urate levels and gout risk. Therefore, our study attempted to state the important role of PKD2 in influencing the pathogenesis of gout.\\n\\nMethodSNPs in PKD2 (rs2725215 and rs2728121) and ABCG2 (rs2231137 and rs1481012) were tested in approximately 5,000 Chinese individuals.\\n\\nResultsTwo epistatic interactions between loci in PKD2 (rs2728121) and ABCG2 (rs1481012 and rs2231137) showed distinct contributions to uric acid levels with P int values of 0.018 and 0.004, respectively, and the associations varies by gender and BMI. The SNP pair of rs2728121 and rs1481012 justly played roles in uric acid in females (P int = 0.006), while the other pair did in males (P int = 0.017). Regarding BMI, the former SNP pair merely contributed in overweigh subjects (P int = 0.022) and the latter one did in both normal and overweigh individuals (P int = 0.013 and 0.047, respectively). Furthermore, the latter SNP pair was also associated with gout pathology (P int = 0.001), especially in males (P int = 0.001). Finally, functional analysis showed potential epistatic interactions in those genes region and PKD2 mRNA expression had a positive correlation with ABCG2s (r = 0.743, P = 5.83e-06).\\n\\nConclusionOur study for the first time identified that epistatic interactions between PKD2 and ABCG2 influenced serum urate concentrations and gout risk, and PKD2 might affect the pathogenesis from elevated serum urate to hyperuricemia to gout by modifying ABCG2.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has identified many factors influencing student acceptance of biological evolution, but few of these factors have been measured in a longitudinal context of changing knowledge and acceptance of evolution over a period of instruction. This study investigates factors previously associated with evolution acceptance as well as other potential factors among students over the course of a year-long majors and non-majors introductory biology sequence at a private, research-intensive university in the northeastern United States. Acceptance of evolution was measured using the Measure of Acceptance of the Theory of Evolution (MATE) instrument, and other factors were measured using well-established instruments and a demographic survey. As expected given the context, evolution was widely accepted among the population (71% of our sample scored in the \\\"high\\\" or \\\"very high\\\" acceptance range), but 160 students were in the very low to moderate acceptance range. Over the course of the academic year, regressions on measures of normalized change revealed that as knowledge of the Nature of Science (NOS) increased, evolution acceptance increased (R2 = .378, p << 0.001). Increasing levels of genetic literacy (R2 = .214, p << 0.001) and Evolutionary Knowledge (R2 = .177, p << 0.001) were also significantly associated with increases in acceptance of evolution. We also examined the longitudinal effect of combining various factors into unified working models of acceptance of evolution, and this is the first study by our knowledge to do so. From fall to spring, the influence of student knowledge of NOS on evolution acceptance increased, as did the influence of genetic literacy. Conversely, the influence of religious variables decreased, as did the influence of political inclinations and race/ethnicity. Our results indicate that as students learn more about the nature of science, they may rely more on scientific explanations for natural phenomena. This study also underscores the importance of using longitudinal, multifactorial analyses to understand acceptance of evolution.",
