    "abstract": "If improvements are to be made in tuberculosis (TB) treatment, an increased understanding of disease in the lung is needed. Studies have shown that bacteria in a less metabolically active state, associated with the presence of lipid bodies, are less susceptible to antibiotics, and recent results have highlighted the disparity in concentration of different compounds into lesions. Treatment success therefore depends critically on the responses of the individual bacteria that constitute the infection.\\n\\nWe propose a hybrid, individual-based approach that analyses spatio-temporal dynamics at the cellular level, linking the behaviour of individual bacteria and host cells with the macroscopic behaviour of the microenvironment. The individual elements (bacteria, macrophages and T cells) are modelled using cellular automaton (CA) rules, and the evolution of oxygen, drugs and chemokine dynamics are incorporated in order to study the effects of the microenvironment in the pathological lesion. We allow bacteria to switch states depending on oxygen concentration, which affects how they respond to treatment. This is the first multiscale model of its type to consider both oxygen-driven phenotypic switching of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis and antibiotic treatment. Using this model, we investigate the role of bacterial cell state and of initial bacterial location on treatment outcome. We demonstrate that when bacteria are located further away from blood vessels, less favourable outcomes are more likely, i.e. longer time before infection is contained/cleared, treatment failure or later relapse. We also show that in cases where bacteria remain at the end of simulations, the organisms tend to be slower-growing and are often located within granulomas, surrounded by caseous material.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive psychologists have long hypothesized that experiences are encoded in a temporal context that changes gradually over time. When an episodic memory is retrieved, the state of context is recovered--a jump back in time. We recorded from single units in the MTL of epilepsy patients performing an item recognition task. The population vector changed gradually over minutes during presentation of the list. When a probe from the list was remembered with high confidence, the population vector reinstated the temporal context of the original presentation of that probe during study--a neural contiguity effect that provides a possible mechanism for behavioral contiguity effects. This pattern was only observed for well-remembered probes; old probes that were not well-remembered showed an anti-contiguity effect. These results constitute the first direct evidence that recovery of an episodic memory in humans is associated with retrieval of a gradually-changing state of temporal context--a neural \\\"jump-back-in-time\\\" that parallels the act of remembering.\\n\\nSignificance statementEpisodic memory is the ability to re-live a specific experience from ones life. For decades, researchers have hypothesized that, unlike other forms of memory that can be described as simple associations between stimuli, episodic memory depends on the recovery of a neural representation of spatiotemporal context. During study of a sequence of stimuli, the brain state of epilepsy patients changed slowly over at least a minute. When the participant remembered a particular event from the list, this gradually-changing state was recovered. This provides direct confirmation of the prediction from computational models of episodic memory. The resolution of this point means that the study of episodic memory can focus on the mechanisms by which this representation of spatiotemporal context is maintained and, sometimes recovered.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression data, such as those generated by next generation sequencing technologies (RNA-seq), are of an inherently relative nature: the total number of sequenced reads has no biological meaning. This issue is most often addressed with various normalization techniques which all face the same problem: once information about the total mRNA content of the origin cells is lost, it cannot be recovered by mere technical means. Additional knowledge, in the form of an unchanged reference, is necessary; however, this reference can usually only be estimated. Here we propose a novel method where sample normalization is unnecessary, but important insights can be obtained nevertheless. Instead of trying to recover absolute abundances, our method is entirely based on ratios, so normalization factors cancel by default. Although the differential expression of individual genes cannot be recovered this way, the ratios themselves can be differentially expressed (even when their constituents are not). Yet, most current analyses are blind to these cases, while our approach reveals them directly. Specifically, we show how the differential expression of gene ratios can be formalized by decomposing log-ratio variance (LRV) and deriving intuitive statistics from it. Although small LRVs have been used to detect proportional genes in gene expression data before, we focus here on the change in proportionality factors between groups of samples (e.g. tissue-specific proportionality). For this, we propose a statistic that is equivalent to the squared t-statistic of one-way ANOVA, but for gene ratios. In doing so, we show how precision weights can be incorporated to account for the peculiarities of count data, and, moreover, how a moderated statistic can be derived in the same way as the one following from a hierarchical model for individual genes. We also discuss approaches to deal with zero counts, deriving an expression of our statistic that is able to incorporate them. In providing a detailed analysis of the connections between the differential expression of genes and the differential proportionality of pairs, we facilitate a clear interpretation of new concepts. The proposed framework is applied to a data set from GTEx consisting of 98 samples from the cerebellum and cortex, with selected examples shown. A computationally efficient implementation of the approach in R has been released as an addendum to the propr package.1",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsDiurnal changes in solar position and intensity combined with the structural complexity of plant architecture result in highly variable and dynamic light patterns within the plant canopy. This affects productivity through the complex ways that photosynthesis responds to changes in light intensity. Current methods to characterise light dynamics, such as ray-tracing, are able to produce data with excellent spatio-temporal resolution but are computationally intensive and the resultant data are complex and high dimensional. This necessitates development of more economical models for summarising the data and for simulating realistic light patterns over the course of a day.\\n\\nMethodsHigh-resolution reconstructions of field-grown plants are assembled in various configurations to form canopies, and a forward ray-tracing algorithm is applied to the canopies to compute light dynamics at high (1 minute) temporal resolution. From the ray-tracer output, the sunlit or shaded state for each patch on the plants is determined, and these data are used to develop a novel stochastic model for the sunlit-shaded patterns. The model is designed to be straightforward to fit to data using maximum likelihood estimation, and fast to simulate from.\\n\\nKey ResultsFor a wide range of contrasting 3D canopies, the stochastic model is able to summarise, and replicate in simulations, key features of the light dynamics. When light patterns simulated from the stochastic model are used as input to a model of photoinhibition, the predicted reduction in carbon gain is similar to that from calculations based on the (extremely costly) ray-tracer data.\\n\\nConclusionsThe model provides a way to summarise highly complex data in a small number of parameters, and a cost-effective way to simulate realistic light patterns. Simulations from the model will be particularly useful for feeding into larger-scale photosynthesis models for calculating how light dynamics affects the photosynthetic productivity of canopies.",

An underlying assumption in aging research has been that DR mimetics extend both lifespan and healthspan jointly, though this has not been rigorously tested in different genetic backgrounds. Furthermore, nutrient response genes important for lifespan or healthspan extension remain underexplored, especially in natural populations. To address these gaps, we utilized over 150 DGRP strains to measure nutrient-dependent changes in lifespan and age-related climbing ability to measure healthspan. DR extended lifespan and delayed decline in climbing ability on average, but there was no evidence of correlation between these traits across individual strains. Through GWAS, we then identified and validated jughead and Ferredoxin as determinants of diet-dependent lifespan, and Daedalus for diet-dependent physical activity. Modulating these genes produced independent effects on lifespan and climbing ability, further suggesting that these age-related traits are likely to be regulated through distinct genetic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Distributed neural dysconnectivity is considered a hallmark feature of schizophrenia, yet a tension exists between studies pinpointing focal disruptions versus those implicating brain-wide disturbances. The cerebellum and the striatum communicate reciprocally with the thalamus and cortex through monosynaptic and polysynaptic connections, forming cortico-striatal-thalamic-cerebellar (CSTC) functional pathways that may be sensitive to brain-wide dysconnectivity in schizophrenia. It remains unknown if the same pattern of alterations persists across CSTC systems, or if specific alterations exist along key functional elements of these networks. We characterized connectivity along major functional CSTC subdivisions using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in 159 chronic patients and 162 matched controls. Associative CSTC subdivisions revealed consistent brain-wide bi-directional alterations in patients, marked by hyper-connectivity with sensory-motor cortices and hypo-connectivity with association cortex. Focusing on the cerebellar and striatal components, we validate the effects using data-driven k-means clustering of voxel-wise dysconnectivity and support vector machine classifiers. We replicate these results in an independent sample of 202 controls and 145 patients, additionally demonstrating that these neural effects relate to cognitive performance across subjects. Taken together, these results from complementary approaches implicate a consistent motif of brain-wide alterations in CSTC systems in schizophrenia, calling into question accounts of exclusively focal functional disturbances.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes is tightly regulated to ensure proper chromosome segregation. Each chromosome pair typically undergoes at least one crossover event (crossover assurance) but these exchanges are also strictly limited in number and widely spaced along chromosomes (crossover interference). This has implied the existence of chromosome-wide signals that regulate crossovers, but their molecular basis remains mysterious. Here we characterize a family of four related RING finger proteins in C. elegans. These proteins are recruited to the synaptonemal complex between paired homologs, where they act as two heterodimeric complexes, likely as E3 ubiquitin ligases. Genetic and cytological analysis reveals that they act with additional components to create a self-extinguishing circuit that controls crossover designation and maturation. These proteins also act at the top of a hierarchical chromosome remodeling process that enables crossovers to direct stepwise segregation. Work in diverse phyla indicates that related mechanisms mediate crossover control across eukaryotes.",

Here, we provide a novel explanation for how human time perception might be accomplished, based on non-temporal perceptual clas-sification processes. To demonstrate this proposal, we built an artificial neural system centred on a feed-forward image classification network, functionally similar to human visual processing. In this system, input videos of natural scenes drive changes in network activation, and accumulation of salient changes in activation are used to estimate duration. Estimates produced by this system match human reports made about the same videos, replicating key qualitative biases, including differentiating between scenes of walking around a busy city or sitting in a cafe or office.

    "abstract": "What forces direct brain organization and its plasticity? When a brain region is deprived of its input would this region reorganize based on compensation for the disability and experience, or would strong limitations of brain structure limit its plasticity? People born without hands activate their sensorimotor hand region while moving body parts used to compensate for this ability (e.g. their feet). This has been taken to suggest a neural organization based on functions, such as performing manual-like dexterous actions, rather than on body parts. Here we test the selectivity for functionally-compensatory body parts in the sensorimotor cortex of people born without hands. Despite clear compensatory foot use, the sensorimotor hand area in the dysplasic subjects showed preference for body parts whose cortical territory is close to the hand area, but which are not compensatorily used as effectors. This suggests that function-based organization, originally proposed for congenital blindness and deafness, does not apply to cases of the primary sensorimotor cortex deprivation in dysplasia. This is consistent with the idea that experience-independent functional specialization occurs at relatively high levels of representation. Indeed, increased and selective foot movement preference in the dysplasics was found in the association cortex, in the inferior parietal lobule. Furthermore, it stresses the roles of neuroanatomical constraints such as topographical proximity and connectivity in determining the functional development of brain regions. These findings reveal limitations to brain plasticity and to the role of experience in shaping the functional organization of the brain.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWhat determines the role of brain regions, and their plasticity when typical inputs or experience is not provided? To what extent can extreme compensatory use affect brain organization? We tested the functional reorganization of the primary sensorimotor cortex hand area in people born without hands, who use their feet for every-day tasks. We found that it is preferentially activated by close-by body-parts which cannot serve as effectors, and not by the feet. In contrast, foot-selective compensatory plasticity was found in the association cortex, in an area involved in tool use. This shows limitations of compensatory plasticity and experience in modifying brain organization of early topographical cortex, as compared to association cortices where function-based organization is the driving factor.\\n\\nClassificationBiological Sciences\\\\Neuroscience",

    "abstract": "During the first weeks of life, microbial colonization of the gut impacts human immune system maturation and other developmental processes. In premature infants, aberrant colonization has been implicated in the onset of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening intestinal disease. To study the premature infant gut colonization process, genome-resolved metagenomics was conducted on 343 fecal samples collected during the first three months of life from 35 premature infants housed in a neonatal intensive care unit, 14 of which developed NEC, and metaproteomic measurements were made on 87 samples. Microbial community composition and proteomic profiles remained relatively stable on the time scale of a week, but the proteome was more variable. Although genetically similar organisms colonized many infants, most infants were colonized by distinct strains with metabolic profiles that could be distinguished using metaproteomics. Microbiome composition correlated with infant, antibiotics administration, and NEC diagnosis. Communities were found to cluster into seven primary types, and community type switched within infants, sometimes multiple times. Interestingly, some communities sampled from the same infant at subsequent time points clustered with those of other infants. In some cases, switches preceded onset of NEC; however, no species or community type could account for NEC across the majority of infants. In addition to a correlation of protein abundances with organism replication rates, we found that organism proteomes correlated with overall community composition. Thus, this genome-resolved proteomics study demonstrates that the contributions of individual organisms to microbiome development depend on microbial community context.\\n\\nImportance\\n\\nHumans are colonized by microbes at birth, a process that is important to health and development.

Infants were found to be colonized by similar microbes, but each underwent a distinct colonization trajectory.\\n\\nInterestingly, related microbes colonizing different infants were found to have distinct proteomes, indicating that microbiome function is not only driven by which organisms are present, but also largely depends on microbial responses to the unique set of physiological conditions in the infant gut.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlyoxalase 1 (GLO1) is an enzyme that metabolizes methylglyoxal (MG), which is a competitive partial agonist at GABAA receptors. Inhibition of GLO1 increases concentrations of MG in the brain and decreases binge-like ethanol drinking. The present study assessed whether inhibition of GLO1, or genetic over expression of Glo1, would also alter the locomotor effects of ethanol, which might explain reduced ethanol consumption following GLO1 inhibition. We used the prototypical GABAA receptor agonist muscimol as a positive control.\\n\\nMethodsMale C57BL/6J mice were pretreated with aeither the GLO1 inhibitor S-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (pBBG; 7.5 mg/kg; Experiment 1) or muscimol (0.75 mg/kg; Experiment 2), or their corresponding vehicle. We then determined whether locomotor response to a range of ethanol doses (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5) was altered by either pBBG or muscimol pretreatment. We also examined the locomotor response to a range of ethanol doses in FVB/NJ wild type and transgenic Glo1 over expressing mice (Experiment 3). Anxiety-like behavior (time spent in the center of the open field) was assessed in all three experiments.\\n\\nResultsThe ethanol dose-response curve was not altered by pretreatment with pBBG or by transgenic overexpression of Glo1. In contrast, muscimol blunted locomotor stimulation at low ethanol doses, and potentiated locomotor sedation at higher ethanol doses. No drug or genotype differences were seen in anxiety-like behavior after ethanol treatment.\\n\\nConclusionsThe dose of pBBG used in this study is within the effective range shown previously to reduce ethanol drinking. Glo1 overexpression has been previously shown to increase ethanol drinking. However, neither manipulation altered the dose response curve for ethanols locomotor effects, whereas muscimol appeared to enhance the locomotor sedative effects of ethanol. The present data demonstrate that reduced ethanol drinking caused by GLO1 inhibition is not due to potentiation of ethanols stimulant or depressant effects.",

    "abstract": "Exoskeletons and robotic devices are for many motor disabled people the only way to interact with their envi-ronment. Our lab previously developed a gaze guided assistive robotic system for grasping. It is well known that the same natural task can require different interactions described by different dynamical systems that would require different robotic controllers and their selection by the user in a self paced way. Therefore, we investigated different ways to achieve transitions between multiple states, finding that eye blinks were the most reliable to transition from  off to  control modes (binary classification) compared to voice and electromyography. In this paper be expanded on this work by investigating brain signals as sources for control mode switching. We developed a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) that allows users to switch between four control modes in self paced way in real time. Since the system is devised to be used in domestic environments in a user friendly way, we selected non-invasive electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), known by their capability to find the optimal features for a classification task, which we hypothesised would add flexibility to the system in terms of which mental activities the user could perform to control it. We tested our system using the Cybathlon BrainRunners computer game, which represents all the challenges inherent to real time control. Our preliminary results show that an efficient architecture (SmallNet) composed by a convolutional layer, a fully connected layer and a sigmoid classification layer, is able to classify 4 mental activities that the user chose to perform. For his preferred mental activities, we run and validated the system online and retrained the system using online collected EEG data. We achieved 47, 6% accuracy in online operation in the 4-way classification task. In particular we found that models trained with online collected data predicted better the behaviour of the system in real time suggesting, as a side note, that similar (ConvNets based) offline classifying methods present in literature might find a decay in performance when applied online. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time such an architecture is tested in an online operation task. While compared to our previous method relying on blinks with this one we reduced in less than half (1.6 times) the accuracy but increased by 2 the amount of states among which we can transit, bringing the opportunity for finer control of specific subtasks composing natural grasping in a self paced way.",

    "abstract": "The schizophrenia and bipolar disorder associated gene, BRD1, encodes a scaffold protein that in complex with epigenetic modifiers regulate gene sets enriched for psychiatric disorder risk. Preclinical evidence from male Brd1+/- mice has previously implicated BRD1 with phenotypes of translational relevance to schizophrenia. Here we describe the phenotype of female Brd1+/- mice and report attenuated dendritic architecture and monoaminergic dysregulation accompanied by sex-specific changes in affective behaviors. In accordance, global gene expression profiling reveals regional dysregulation of gene sets enriched with major depressive disorder and schizophrenia risk in female and male Brd1+/- mice, respectively. Independent of sex, however, differentially expressed genes cluster in common functional pathways associated with psychiatric disorders, including mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation as well as G-protein coupled-, and nuclear receptor mediated signaling. Accordingly, we provide in vitro evidence that BRD1 modulates the transcriptional drive of a subset of nuclear receptors (e.g. the vitamin D and glucocorticoid receptors). Moreover, we demonstrate enrichment of psychiatric disorder risk in the target genes of nuclear receptors, sex-biased expression of several nuclear receptor genes in the adult brain of Brd1+/- mice, and that sex-biased genes in general are enriched with nuclear receptor genes particularly at the earliest developmental stage of the human brain. Overall, our data suggests that the spatio-temporal interaction between BRD1 and subsets of nuclear receptors in the brain is sex-biased and that hampered BRD1 mediated regulation of target genes governed by certain nuclear receptors may significantly contribute to sex differences in psychopathology.",

    "abstract": "The study of neuronal responses to random-dot motion patterns has provided some of the most valuable insights into how the activity of neurons is related to perception. In the opposite directions of motion paradigm, the motion signal strength is decreased by manipulating the coherence of random dot patterns to examine how well the activity of single neurons represents the direction of motion. To extend this paradigm to populations of neurons, studies have used modelling based on data from pairs of neurons, but several important questions require further investigation with larger neuronal datasets. We recorded neuronal populations in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas of anaesthetized marmosets with electrode arrays, while varying the coherence of random dot patterns in two opposite directions of motion (left and right). Using the spike rates of simultaneously recorded neurons, we decoded the direction of motion at each level of coherence with linear classifiers. We found that the presence of correlations had a detrimental effect to decoding performance, but that learning the correlation structure produced better decoding performance compared to decoders that ignored the correlation structure. We also found that reducing motion coherence increased neuronal correlations, but decoders did not need to be optimized for each coherence level. Finally, we showed that decoder weights depend of left-right selectivity at 100% coherence, rather than the preferred direction. These results have implications for understanding how the information encoded by populations of neurons is affected by correlations in spiking activity.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMany studies have examined how the spiking activity of single neurons can encode stimulus features, such the direction of motion of visual stimuli. However, majority of such studies to date have only recorded from a small number of neurons at the same time, meaning that one cannot adequately account for the trial-to-trial correlations in spiking activity between neurons. Using multi-channel recordings, we were able to measure the neuronal correlations, and their effects on population coding of stimulus features. Our results have implications on the way which neural populations must be readout in order to maximize information.",

    "abstract": "The MYC oncogene promotes tumorigenesis in part by facilitating cell cycle entry thus driving cellular proliferation. Tumors that overexpress MYC frequently demonstrate aneuploidy, numerical chromosome alterations associated with highly aggressive cancers, rapid tumor evolution, and poor patient outcome. While the role of MYC in overcoming the G1/S checkpoint is well established, it remains poorly understood whether MYC induces chromosomal instability (CIN). Here, we identify a direct influence of MYC on mitotic progression. MYC overexpression induces defects in microtubule nucleation and spindle assembly promoting chromosome segregation defects, micronuclei and CIN. We examined which mitotic regulators are required for the survival of MYC-overexpressing cells and found a reliance on high TPX2 expression. TPX2, a master microtubule regulator, is overexpressed together with MYC in multiple cell lines, in mouse tumor models and in aggressive human breast cancers. High TPX2 expression is permissive for mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation in cells with deregulated MYC, whereas TPX2 depletion blocks mitotic progression, induces cell death and prevents tumor growth. Importantly, attenuation of MYC expression reverses the mitotic defects observed, even in established tumor cell lines, implicating an ongoing role for high MYC in the persistence of a CIN phenotype in tumors. Here, we implicate the MYC oncogene as a regulator of spindle assembly and dynamics and identify a new MYC-TPX2 synthetic-lethal interaction that could represent a future therapeutic strategy in MYC-overexpressing cancers. Our studies suggest that blocking MYC activity can attenuate the emergence of CIN and tumor evolution.",

    "abstract": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles around 30-100 nm in diameter that are secreted from cells and can be found in most body fluids. Exosomes can be a vital source of biomarkers as they contain various substances (e.g. lipids, RNAs, metabolites and proteins) that can reflect the cell of origin (e.g. cancer cells). For isolation of exosomes present in biological matrices, ultracentrifugation (UC)-based procedures are most common. Other approaches exist, including commercial kits developed for easy and low sample volume isolation. In this study, differential UC and an isolation kit from a major vendor (Total Exosome Isolation Reagent from Thermo Fisher Scientific) were compared. Exosomes were isolated from cell culture media of two different cell sources (patient derived cells from glioblastoma multiforme and the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231). For both isolation methods, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and western blotting indicated the presence of exosomes. The kit- and UC isolates contained similar amounts of protein measured by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay with absorbance at 562 nm. Using western blot, positive exosome markers were identified in all isolates, and additional exosome markers were identified using MS-based proteomics. For the glioblastoma exosome isolates, the number of proteins identified with liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) was higher for the UC isolates than the kit isolates when injecting equal protein amounts, contrary to that for the breast cancer exosome isolates. However, negative exosome markers were also found in glioblastoma isolates using LC-MS/MS. Thus, we would not use the term \\\"exosome isolation\\\" as impurities may be present with both isolation methods. Notably, potential biomarkers for both diseases were identified in the isolates using LS-MS/MS. In our opinion, the two isolation methods had rather similar performance, although with some minor differences based on cell of origin.",

    "abstract": "We present and analyze a growth model of an avascular tumor that considers the basic biological principles of proliferation, motility, death and genetic mutations of the cell. From a regulatory network analysis and an analysis of genomic data we identify two sets of genes-a set of six genes and a set of sixteen genes-that are believed to play an important role in the evolution of breast cancer. Considering that cancer cells shape the tissue microenvironment and niches to their competitive advantage, the model assumes that cancer and normal cells compete for essential nutrients and that the rate of the \\\"driver\\\" mutations depends on nutrient availability. To this end, we propose a coupling between the transport of nutrients and gene mutations dynamics. Gene mutation dynamics are modeled as a Yule-Furry Markovian process, while transport of nutrients is described with a system of reaction-diffusion equations. For each representative tumor we calculate its diversity, represented by the Shannon index, and its spatial heterogeneity, measured by its fractal dimension. These quantities are important in the clinical diagnosis of tumor malignancy. A tumor malignancy diagram, obtained by plotting diversity versus fractal dimension, is calculated for different values of a parameter {beta}, which is related to the occurrence of driver mutations. It is found that when {beta} < 1, tumors show greater diversity and more spatial heterogeneity as compared with {beta} > 1. More importantly, it is found that the results and conclusions are similar when we use the six-gene set versus sixteen-gene set.",

    "abstract": "Cholinergic vagal nerves projecting from neurons in the brainstem nucleus ambiguus (NAm) play a predominant role in cardiac parasympathetic pacemaking control. Central adrenergic signaling modulates the tone of this vagal output; however the exact excitability mechanisms are not fully understood. We investigated responses of NAm neurons to adrenergic agonists using in vitro mouse brainstem slices. Preganglionic NAm neurons were identified by Chat-tdtomato fluorescence in young adult transgenic mice and their cardiac projection confirmed by retrograde dye tracing. Juxtacellular recordings detected sparse or absent spontaneous action potentials (AP) in NAm neurons. However bath application of epinephrine or norepinephrine strongly and reversibly activated most NAm neurons regardless of their basal firing rate. Epinephrine was more potent than norepinephrine, and this activation largely depends on 1-adrenoceptors. Interestingly, adrenergic activation of NAm neurons does not require an ionotropic synaptic mechanism, since postsynaptic excitatory or inhibitory receptor blockade did not occlude the excitatory effect, and bath-applied adrenergic agonists did not alter excitatory or inhibitory synaptic transmission. Instead, adrenergic agonists significantly elevated intrinsic membrane excitability to facilitate generation of recurrent action potentials. T-type calcium current (ICaT) and hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) are involved in this excitation pattern, while not required for spontaneous AP induction by epinephrine. In contrast, pharmacological blockade of persistent sodium current (INaP) significantly inhibited the adrenergic effects. Our results demonstrate that central adrenergic signaling enhances the intrinsic excitability of NAm neurons, and persistent sodium current is required for this effect. This central balancing mechanism may counteract excessive peripheral cardiac excitation during increased sympathetic tone.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyCardiac preganglionic cholinergic neurons in the Nucleus ambiguus (NAm) are responsible for slowing cardiac pacemaking. This study identified that adrenergic agonists can induce rhythmic action potentials in otherwise quiescent cholinergic NAm preganglionic neurons in brainstem slice preparation. The modulatory influence of adrenaline on central parasympathetic outflow may contribute to both physiological and deleterious cardiovascular regulation.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to low dose lipopolysaccharide prior to cerebral ischemia is neuroprotective in stroke models, a phenomenon termed preconditioning. While it is well established that lipopolysaccharide-preconditioning induces central and peripheral immune responses, the cellular mechanisms modulating ischemic injury remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of immune cells in the brain protection afforded by preconditioning and we tested whether monocytes may be reprogrammed by ex vivo lipopolysaccharide exposure thus modulating the inflammatory injury after cerebral ischemia in male mice. We found that systemic injection of low-dose lipopolysaccharide induces a distinct subclass of CD115+Ly6Chi monocytes that protect the brain after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Remarkably, adoptive transfer of monocytes isolated from preconditioned mice into naive mice 7 hours after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion reduced brain injury. Gene expression and functional studies showed that IL-10, iNOS and CCR2 in monocytes are essential for the neuroprotection. This protective activity was elicited even if mouse or human monocytes were exposed ex vivo to lipopolysaccharide and then injected into male mice after stroke. Cell tracking studies showed that protective monocytes are mobilized from the spleen and reach brain and meninges, wherein they suppressed post-ischemic inflammation and neutrophils influx into the brain parenchyma. Our findings unveil a previously unrecognized subpopulation of splenic monocytes capable to protect the brain with an extended therapeutic window, and provide the rationale for cell therapies based on the delivery of autologous or allogeneic protective monocytes into patients with ischemic stroke.\\n\\nSignificance StatementInflammation is a key component of the pathophysiology of the brain in stroke, a leading cause of death and disability with limited therapeutic options. Here, we investigate endogenous mechanisms of protection against cerebral ischemia. Using LPS preconditioning as an approach to induce ischemic tolerance in mice, we found the generation of neuroprotective monocytes within the spleen from where they traffic to the brain and meninges suppressing post-ischemic inflammation. Importantly, systemic LPS preconditioning can be mimicked by adoptive transfer of in vitro-preconditioned mouse or human monocytes at translational relevant time points after stroke. This model of neuroprotection may facilitate clinical efforts to increase the efficacy of bone marrow mononuclear cell treatments in acute neurological diseases such as cerebral ischemia.",

We obtained quantitative measures using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) from two population-based cohorts of European ancestry: UK Biobank (UKB; N=121,604) and 23andMe (N=20,328) and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis. We also performed GWAS for AUDIT items 1-3, which focus on consumption (AUDIT-C), and for items 4-10, which focus on the problematic consequences of drinking (AUDIT-P). The GWAS meta-analysis of AUDIT total score identified 10 associated risk loci. Novel associations localized to genes including JCAD and SLC39A13; we also replicated previously identified signals in the genes ADH1B, ADH1C, KLB, and GCKR. The dimensions of AUDIT showed positive genetic correlations with alcohol consumption (rg=0.76-0.92) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) alcohol dependence (rg=0.33-0.63). AUDIT-P and AUDIT-C showed significantly different patterns of association across a number of traits, including psychiatric disorders. AUDIT-P was positively genetically correlated with schizophrenia (rg=0.22, p=3.0x10-10), major depressive disorder (rg=0.26, p=5.6x10-3), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; rg=0.23, p=1.1x10-5), whereas AUDIT-C was negatively genetically correlated with major depressive disorder (rg=-0.24, p=3.7x10-3) and ADHD (rg=-0.10, p=1.8x10-2). We also used the AUDIT data in the UKB to identify thresholds for dichotomizing AUDIT total score that optimize genetic correlations with DSM-IV alcohol dependence.

In the context of Alzheimers disease (AD), patients with higher CR show better cognitive performance relative to brain damage therefore higher CR reduces the risk of dementia. There is a strong need to develop a reliable biomarker of CR given the growing interest in understanding protective brain mechanisms in AD. Recent fMRI studies indicate that frontoparietal network may play an important role in the maintenance of cognitive reserve. The goal of this study was to measure functional connectivity (FC) of the prefrontal cortex using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and to study the relationship of prefrontal FC with cognitive abilities and motoric skills.\\n\\nWe analyzed resting state optical data recorded from prefrontal cortex in 13 healthy individuals who were also assessed by Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) test and the Purdue Pegboard test (PPT). For each participant, activity of each prefrontal channel was correlated with all other channels and positive correlation coefficients were Fisher-transformed and averaged over all PFC channels giving the Global Functional Connectivity (GFC) of PFC. The resulting GFC number for each individual was then correlated with the corresponding IQ (WASI full score) and the PPT scores.\\n\\nPrefrontal connectivity was found to positively correlate with IQ while showing the lack of or negative correlation with the Purdue Pegboard subtests. These results demonstrate that the cost-effective and noninvasive NIRS technology can be used to evaluate prefrontal functional connectivity thus providing a neurophysiological measure of cognitive reserve.\\n\\nE-mail address for correspondence:\\n\\nam236@georgetown.edu",

Inter-rater reliability for the CRS-R total score ({kappa}=0.99, p<0.001) and subscale scores was good. We showed high internal consistency (=0.87 and 0.89 for the first and second visit respectively). We also showed good criterion validity between two other standardized behavioral scales (moderate correlation with GCS, r=0.597 and high correlation with FOUR Score, r=0.900). CRS-R also demonstrated a significantly higher sensitivity in differential diagnosis of DOC, as compared to GCS, and FOUR Score (p<0.001).\\n\\nConclusion: The results show that the Russian version of the CRS-R is a valid and sensitive tool for the evaluation of severely brain damaged patients with chronic DOC which can be used for differential diagnosis and for the assessment of dynamic recovery.",

NIRS is a remote sensing method that uses the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. It detects the absorption of light by molecular bonds and can be used with live insects. We employ the chemometric approach to combine spectra and reference data from a known sample to produce a multivariate calibration model. Once the calibration model was developed, we used an independent set to validate the accuracy of the calibration model. The optimized calibration model for triglyceride quantification yielded an accuracy of 73%. Simultaneously, we used NIRS to discriminate two species of Drosophila. Flies from independent sets were correctly classified into D. melanogaster and D. simulans with accuracy higher than 80%. Finally, we show that the biological interpretations derived from reference data and the NIRS predictions do not differ. These results suggest that NIRS has the potential to be used as a high throughput screening method to assess a live individual insects triglyceride level and taxonomic status.",

    "abstract": "To position the mitotic spindle within the cell, dynamic plus ends of astral microtubules are pulled by membrane-associated cortical force-generating machinery. However, in contrast to the chromosome-bound kinetochore structure, how the diffusion-prone cortical machinery is organized to generate large spindle-pulling forces remains poorly understood. Here, we develop a light-induced reconstitution system in human cells. We find that induced cortical targeting of NuMA, but not dynein, is sufficient for spindle pulling. This spindle-pulling activity requires dynein-dynactin recruitment/activation by NuMAs N-terminal long arm, and NuMAs direct microtubule-binding activities to achieve a multiplicity of microtubule interactions. Importantly, we demonstrate that cortical NuMA assembles specialized focal structures that cluster multiple force-generating modules to generate cooperative spindle-pulling forces. This clustering activity of NuMA is required for spindle positioning, but not for spindle-pole focusing. We propose that cortical Dynein-Dynactin-NuMA (DDN) clusters act as the core force-generating machinery that organizes a multi-arm ensemble reminiscent of the kinetochore.",

    "abstract": "The excretory canals of Caenorhabditis elegans are a model for understanding the maintenance of apical morphology in narrow single-celled tubes. Light and electron microscopy shows that mutants in exc-2 start to form canals normally, but these swell to develop large fluid-filled cysts that lack a complete terminal web at the apical surface, and accumulate filamentous material in the canal lumen. Here, whole-genome sequencing and gene rescue show that exc-2 encodes intermediate filament protein IFC-2. EXC-2/IFC-2 protein, fluorescently tagged via CRISPR/Cas9, is located at the apical surface of the canals independently of other intermediate filament proteins. EXC-2 is also located in several other tissues, though the tagged isoforms are not seen in the larger intestinal tube. Tagged EXC-2 binds via pulldown to intermediate filament protein IFA-4, which is also shown to line the canal apical surface. Overexpression of either protein results in narrow but shortened canals. These results are consistent with a model whereby three intermediate filaments in the canals, EXC-2, IFA-4, and IFB-1, restrain swelling of narrow tubules in concert with actin filaments that guide the extension and direction of tubule outgrowth, while allowing the tube to bend as the animal moves.\\n\\nArticle SummaryThe C. elegans excretory canals form a useful model for understanding formation of narrow tubes. exc-2 mutants start to form normal canals that then swell into fluid-filled cysts. We show that exc-2 encodes a large intermediate filament (IF) protein previously not thought to be located in the canals. EXC-2 is located at the apical (luminal) membrane, binds to another IF protein, and appears to be one of three IF proteins that form a flexible meshwork to maintain the thin canal diameter. This work provides a genetically useful model for understanding the interactions of IF proteins with other cytoskeletal elements to regulate tube size and growth.",

    "abstract": "Improved embryo selection is crucial in optimizing the results from assisted reproduction. Preimplantation genetic screening reduces time to pregnancy and miscarriages. Correlating the transcriptome of an embryo, with fertility treatments and outcomes, holds promise in improving the overall results. We developed a novel method for embryo selection in fertility treatments that integrates embryonic genomic and transcriptomic data and evaluated it in this pilot study.\\n\\nA total of 21 embryos donated for research were included. Three were used for the initial development and optimization of sample processing and sequencing. Thereafter, 18 embryos were used to demonstrate the clinical safety and reproducibility of our method. Two trophectoderm biopsies were taken from each embryo: one was processed as a clinical sample for genomic profiling (control, n=18), while the other biopsy (n=18) was split and utilized for independent, simultaneous genomic and transcriptomic analysis, here termed Preimplantation Genetic and Transcriptomic Testing (PGT2).\\n\\nHigh quality genomic and transcriptomic data were obtained from all analyzed samples. The concordance between genomic data obtained with PGT2 and control samples was 100% with clinical grade quality metrics. Euploid embryos showed downregulation of genes involved in anaerobic metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty-acid oxidation. This is the first study to provide full genomic and transcriptomic profiles from a single TE biopsy from human embryos in a clinical setting unleashing the potential of improving embryo selection and outcomes in infertility treatments. Clinical trials are needed to correlate transcriptomic data with outcomes.\\n\\nSUMMARYDespite advances in assisted reproductive technologies, the success rate has remained relatively constant. Under the age of 35, there is a 40% chance of delivering a child per embryo transfer, which decreases with increasing maternal age. Prioritizing embryos for transfer is based on morphological assessment and, in some cases, incorporates genetic testing as well. Selection of euploid embryos for transfer shortens the time to pregnancy and reduces the risk for miscarriages. Adding the mRNA analysis to the genomic assessment of an embryo has the potential of improving the outcomes of fertility treatments.",

    "abstract": "Glycogen synthesis is vital, malstructure resulting in precipitation and accumulation into neurotoxic polyglucosan bodies (PBs). One well-understood mechanism of PB generation is glycogen branching enzyme deficiency (GBED). Less understood is Lafora disease (LD), resulting from absence of the glycogen phosphatase laforin or the E3 ubiquitin ligase malin, and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated PBs. LD afforded first insight that glycogen sphericity depends on more than adequate branching activity. Unexpectedly, deficiencies of the Linear Ubiquitin Chain Assembly Complex (LUBAC) components RBCK1 and HOIP result in PBs in muscle tissues. Here we analyzed nervous system phenotypes of mice lacking RBCK1 and find profuse PB accumulations in brain and spinal cord with extensive neurodegeneration and neurobehavioral deficits. Brain glycogen in these mice is characterized by long chains and hyperphosphorylation, similar to LD. Like in LD, glycogen synthase and branching enzyme are unaltered. Regional PB distribution mirrors LD and not GBED. Perisynaptic PB localization is unlike LD or GBED. The results indicate that RBCK1 is part of a system supplementing laforin-malin in regulating glycogen architecture including in unique neuronal locales.",

Inactivation of NUPR1 expression in pancreatic cancer cells results in lower ATP production, higher consumption of glucose with a significant switch from OXPHOS to glycolysis followed by necrotic cell death. Importantly, induction of necrosis is independent of the caspase activity. We demonstrated that NUPR1 inactivation triggers a massive release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol and a strong increase in ROS production by mitochondria with a concomitant relocalization of mitochondria to the vicinity of the ER. In addition, transcriptomic analysis of NUPR1-deficient cells shows the induction of an ER stress which is associated to a decrease in the expression of some ER stress response-associated genes. Indeed, during ER stress induced by the treatment with thapsigargin, brefeldin A or tunicamycin, an increase in the mitochondrial malfunction with higher induction of necrosis was observed in NUPR1-defficent cells. Finally, activation of NUPR1 during acute pancreatitis protects acinar cells of necrosis in mice. Altogether, these data enable us to describe a model in which inactivation of NUPR1 in pancreatic cancer cells results in an ER stress that induces a mitochondrial malfunction, a deficient ATP production and, as consequence, the cell death by necrosis.\\n\\nHighlightsNUPR1 expression promotes pancreatic cancer development and progression\\n\\nNUPR1-depletion is a promising therapeutic strategy to be used for treating cancers\\n\\nNUPR1-depletion induces ER stress, mitochondrial malfunction and a significant switch from OXPHOS to glycolysis followed by necrotic cell death\\n\\nInactivation of NUPR1 antagonizes cell growth by coupling a defective ER-stress response and a caspase-independent necrosis.",

    "abstract": "The nervous system regulates complex behaviors through a network of neurons interconnected by synapses. How specific synaptic connections are genetically determined is still unclear. Male mating is the most complex behavior in C. elegans. It is composed of sequential steps that are governed by more than 3,000 chemical connections. Here we show that heparan sulfates (HS) play a role in the formation and function of the male neural network. Cell-autonomous and non-autonomous 3-O sulfation by the HS modification enzyme HST-3.1/HS 3-O-sulfotransferase, localized to the HSPG glypicans LON-2/glypican and GPN-1/glypican, was specifically required for response to hermaphrodite contact during mating. Loss of 3-O sulfation resulted in the presynaptic accumulation of RAB-3, a molecule that localizes to synaptic vesicles, disrupting the formation of synapses in a component of the mating circuits. We also show that neural cell adhesion protein neurexin promotes and neural cell adhesion protein neuroligin inhibits formation of the same set of synapses in a parallel pathway. Thus, neural cell adhesion proteins and extracellular matrix components act together in the formation of synaptic connections.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe formation of the nervous system requires the function of several genetically-encoded proteins to form complex networks. Enzymatically-generated modifications of these proteins play a crucial role during this process. These authors analyzed the role of heparan sulfates in the process of synaptogenesis in the male tail of C. elegans. A modification of heparan sulfate is required for the formation of specific synapses between neurons by acting cell-autonomously and non-autonomously. Could it be that heparan sulfates and their diverse modifications are a component of the specification factor that neurons use to make such large numbers of connections unique?",

    "abstract": "A robust regulation of plant immune responses requires multitude of positive and negative regulators that act in concert. The immune-associated nucleotide-binding (IAN) gene family members are associated with immunity in different organisms, although no characterization of their function has been carried out to date in plants. In this work, we analyzed the expression patterns of IAN genes and found that IAN9 is repressed upon pathogen infection or treatment with immune elicitors. IAN9 encodes a plasma membrane-localized protein that genetically behaves as a negative regulator of immunity. A novel ian9 mutant generated by CRISPR/Cas9 shows increased resistance to Pseudomonas syringae, while transgenic plants overexpressing IAN9 show a slight increase in susceptibility. In vivo immunoprecipitation of IAN9-GFP followed by mass spectrometry analysis revealed that IAN9 associates with a previously uncharacterized C3HC4-type RING finger domain-containing protein that we named IAP1, for IAN9-associated protein 1, which also acts as a negative regulator of basal immunity. Interestingly, neither ian9 or iap1 mutant plants show any obvious developmental phenotype, suggesting that they display enhanced inducible immunity rather than constitutive immune responses. Since both IAN9 and IAP1 have orthologs in important crop species, they could be suitable targets to generate plants more resistant to diseases caused by bacterial pathogens without yield penalty.",

    "abstract": "calcineurin (CaN) is a serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes in mammalian tissue. The CaN regulatory domain (RD) is responsible for regulating the enzymes phosphatase activity, and is believed to be highly-disordered when inhibiting CaN, but undergoes a disorderto-order transition upon diffusion-limited binding with the regulatory protein calmodulin (CaM). The prevalence of polar and charged amino acids in the regulatory domain (RD) suggests electrostatic interactions are involved in mediating CaM binding, yet the lack of atomistic-resolution data for the bound complex has stymied efforts to probe how the RD sequence controls its conformational ensemble and long-range attractions contribute to target protein binding. In the present study, we investigated via computational modeling the extent to which electrostatics and structural disorder cofacilitate or hinder CaM/CaN association kinetics. Specifically, we examined several RD constructs that contain the CaM binding region (CAMBR) to characterize the roles of electrostatics versus conformational diversity in controlling diffusion-limited association rates, via microsecond-scale molecular dynamics (MD) and Brownian dynamic (BD) simulations. Our results indicate that the RD amino acid composition and sequence length influence both the dynamic availability of conformations amenable to CaM binding, as well as long-range electrostatic interactions to steer association. These findings provide intriguing insight into the interplay between conformational diversity and electrostatically-driven protein-protein association involving CaN, which are likely to extend to wide-ranging diffusion-limited processes regulated by intrinsically-disordered proteins.",

    "abstract": "In Krammers theory, stiffness and dissipation coefficient of a protein determine the rate of their conformational change. Using atomic force microscope, it is possible to measure viscoelasticity of a single protein, wherein its dissipative and elastic nature is directly and independently measured. Such measurements are performed, either by measuring the thermal fluctuations of the protein held under a constant force, or by providing small modulations to the protein by dithering the cantilever and measuring its response. In small amplitude approximation, where dither amplitude is comparable to persistence length of polymers, it is possible to measure the proteins viscoelastic response accurately. We measured dissipation in I27 at extremely low pulling speeds ([~] 50 nm/s) and low dither frequencies ([~]100 Hz). At these experimental parameters the dissipation is found to be [~]10-5 kg/s, well above the detection limit of conventional AFM and upper limit predicted by Benedetti et al. Our stiffness data clearly reveals unfolding intermediate of titins individual immunoglobulin units. The intermediate is elongation of folded domains by [~]8 [A], wherein two hydrogen bonds are broken between beta sheets. It was possible to measure this elongation in our experiments. The directly measured internal friction of unfolded polymer chain shows a scaling with tension on the chain. The measurements show that it is possible to measure internal friction in single molecules unambiguously using small amplitude AFM. It suggests that systematic experiments to unravel the relation between directly measured internal friction and folding rates of proteins are possible.",

    "abstract": "When studying microtubules in vitro, label free imaging of single microtubules is necessary when the quantity of purified tubulin is too low for efficient fluorescent labeling or there is concern that labelling will disrupt its function. Commonly used techniques for observing unlabeled microtubules, such as video enhanced differential interference contrast, dark-field and more recently laser-based interferometric scattering microscopy, suffer from a number of drawbacks. The contrast of differential interference contrast images depends on the orientation of the microtubules, dark-field is highly sensitive to impurities and optical misalignments, and interferometric scattering has a limited field of view. In addition, all of these techniques require costly optical components such as Nomarski prisms, dark-field condensers, lasers and laser scanners. Here we show that single microtubules can be imaged at high speed and with high contrast using interference reflection microscopy without the aforementioned drawbacks. Interference reflection microscopy is simple to implement, requiring only the incorporation of a 50/50 mirror instead of a dichroic in a fluorescence microscope, and with appropriate microscope settings has similar signal-to-noise ratio to differential interference contrast and fluorescence. We demonstrated the utility of interference reflection microscopy by high speed imaging and tracking of dynamic microtubules at 100 frames per second. In conclusion, the image quality of interference reflection microscopy is similar to or exceeds that of all other techniques and, with minimal microscope modification, can be used to study the dynamics of unlabeled microtubules.",

Using a sensitive perceptual decision task in monkeys, we examined the effects of randomly-interleaved, rapid, reversible inactivation on a spatial scale previously achieved only with electrical microstimulation. Inactivating neurons in area MT with consistent direction tuning produced systematic effects on choice and confidence. Behavioral effects were attenuated over the course of each session, suggesting compensatory adjustments in the downstream readout of MT over tens of minutes. Compensation also occurred on a sub-second time scale: behavior was largely unaffected on trials with visual stimuli (and concurrent suppression) longer than [~]350ms. These trends were similar for choice and confidence, consistent with the idea of a common mechanism underlying both measures. The findings demonstrate the utility of hyperpolarizing opsins for linking neural population activity at fine spatial and temporal scales to cognitive functions in primates.",

Here, we addressed this using head-attached microphones to accurately record song amplitude in male zebra finches while presenting a female at difference distances. We show that individual courtship song syllables either increased (5/13) or decreased their amplitude (4/13) as distance from the female increased. Both increases and decreases were part of more general acoustic changes that resulted in properties more similar to those of \\\"undirected\\\" songs typically produced in the absence of a female. Increasing distance also reduced female responses to songs and absence of female responses reduced courtship song amplitude and number of songs per bout. These data suggest a simple behavioral mechanism where distance-dependent song amplitude changes reflect song state changes. Such state changes may be a general mechanism underlying distance-dependent amplitude changes in other organisms.",

    "abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET), along with many other fields of clinical research, is both timeconsuming and expensive, and recruitable patients can be scarce. These constraints limit the possibility of large-sample experimental designs, and often lead to statistically underpowered studies. This problem is exacerbated by the use of outcome measures whose accuracy is sometimes insufficient to answer the scientific questions posed. Reliability is usually assessed in validation studies using healthy participants, however these results are often not easily applicable to clinical studies examining different populations. I present a new method and tools for using summary statistics from previously published test-retest studies to approximate the reliability of outcomes in new samples. In this way, the feasibility of a new study can be assessed during planning stages, and before collecting any new data. An R package called relfeas also accompanies this article for performing these calculations. In summary, these methods and tools will allow researchers to avoid performing costly studies which are, by virtue of their design, unlikely to yield informative conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Access to large-scale genomics and transcriptomics data from various tissues and cell lines allowed the discovery of wide-spread alternative splicing events and alternative promoter usage in mammalians. However, evolutionary studies primarily focus on gene-level orthology relationships, which hinders the importance of transcript-level diversity. Between human and mouse, gene-level orthology is currently present for nearly 16k protein-coding genes spanning a diverse repertoire of over 200k total transcript isoforms. Here we describe a novel method, ExTraMapper, which leverages sequence conservation between exons of a pair of organisms and identifies a fine-scale orthology mapping at the exon and then transcript level. ExTraMapper identifies more than 250k exon, as well as 30k transcript mappings between human and mouse using only sequence and gene annotation information. We demonstrate that ExTraMapper identifies a larger number of exon and transcript mappings compared to previous methods. Further, it identifies exon fusions, splits, and losses due to splice site mutations, and finds mappings between microexons that are previously missed. By reanalysis of RNA-seq data from 13 matched human and mouse tissues, we show that ExTraMapper improves the correlation of transcript-specific expression levels suggesting a more accurate mapping of human and mouse transcripts. ExTraMapper also reports better transcript-level mappings compared to Ensembl orthology for the human proto-oncogene BRAF and its mouse ortholog as well as several other example genes with important isoform-specific functions. ExTraMapper is applicable to any pair of organisms that have orthologous gene pairs and is available at https://github.com/ay-lab/ExTraMapper and http://ay-lab-tools.lji.org/extramapper",

    "abstract": "Inter-tumour heterogeneity is one of cancers most fundamental features. Patient stratification based on drug response prediction is hence needed for effective anti-cancer therapy. However, lessons from the past indicate that single-gene markers of response are rare and/or often fail to achieve a significant impact in clinic. In this context, Machine Learning (ML) is emerging as a particularly promising complementary approach to precision oncology. Here we leverage comprehensive Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) pharmacogenomic data sets with dimensionality-reducing ML algorithms with this purpose. Results show that combining multiple gene alterations via ML leads to better discrimination between sensitive and resistant PDXs in 19 of the 26 analysed cases. Highly predictive ML models employing concise gene lists were found for three cases: Paclitaxel (breast cancer), Binimetinib (breast cancer) and Cetuximab (colorectal cancer). Interestingly, each of these ML models identify some responsive PDXs not harbouring the best actionable mutation for that case (such PDXs were missed by those single-gene markers). Moreover, ML multi-gene predictors generally retrieve a much higher proportion of treatment-sensitive PDXs than the corresponding single-gene marker. As PDXs often recapitulate clinical outcomes, these results suggest that many more patients could benefit from precision oncology if multiple ML algorithms were applied to existing clinical pharmacogenomics data, especially those algorithms generating classifiers combining data-selected gene alterations.",

Some GSK3{beta} substrates, such as c-myc and snail, are nuclear-resident transcription factors, suggesting possible control of GSK3{beta} function by regulation of its nuclear localization. Inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) led to partial redistribution of GSK3{beta} from the cytosol to the nucleus, and GSK3{beta}-dependent reduction of the expression of c-myc and snail. mTORC1 is controlled by metabolic cues, such as by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or amino acid abundance. Indeed AMPK activation or amino acid deprivation promoted GSK3{beta} nuclear localization in an mTORC1-dependent manner. GSK3{beta} was detected in several distinct endomembrane compartments, including lysosomes. Consistently, disruption of late endosomes/lysosomes through perturbation of Rab7 resulted in loss of GSK3{beta} from lysosomes, and enhanced GSK3{beta} nuclear localization as well as GSK3{beta}-dependent reduction of c-myc levels. This indicates that GSK3{beta} nuclear localization and function is suppressed by mTORC1, and suggests a new link between metabolic conditions sensed by mTORC1 and GSK3{beta}-dependent regulation of transcriptional networks controlling biomass production.\\n\\nSummary statement (15-30 words)GSK3{beta} nuclear localization and function is negatively regulated by the metabolic and mitogenic sensor mTORC1. mTORC1 control of GSK3{beta} localization requires Rab7 and lysosomal membrane traffic.",

    "abstract": "Nodal-related protein (ndr2) is a member of the transforming growth factor type {beta} superfamily of factors and is required for ventral midline patterning of the embryonic central nervous system in zebrafish. In humans, mutations in the gene encoding nodal cause holoprosencephaly and heterotaxy. Mutations in the ndr2 gene in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) lead to similar phenotypes, including loss of the medial floor plate, severe deficits in ventral forebrain development, and cyclopia. Alleles of the ndr2 gene have been useful in studying patterning of ventral structures of the central nervous system. Fifteen different ndr2 alleles have been reported in zebrafish, of which eight were generated using chemical mutagenesis, four were radiation-induced, and the remaining alleles were obtained via random insertion, gene targeting (TALEN), or unknown methods. Therefore, most mutation sites were random and could not be predicted a priori. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes, we targeted distinct regions in all three exons of zebrafish ndr2 and observed cyclopia in the injected (G0) embryos. We show that the use of sgRNA-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes can cause penetrant cyclopic phenotypes in injected (G0) embryos. Targeted PCR amplicon analysis using Sanger sequencing showed that most of the alleles had small indels resulting in frameshifts. The sequence information correlates with the loss of ndr2 activity. In this study, we validate multiple CRISPR targets using an in vitro nuclease assay and in vivo analysis using embryos. We describe one specific mutant allele resulting in loss of conserved terminal cysteine-coding sequences. This study is another demonstration of the utility of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in generating domain- specific mutations and provides further insights into the structure-function of the ndr2 gene.",

In the current study, we use multiple methods to identify and confirm the gene associated with a familial ASD. Chromosomal microarray analyses, whole exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing, multiple bioinformatics programs, in silico protein structure modeling and molecular dynamics simulation were performed to predict the pathogenic of the variant gene. Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to evaluate the influence of downstream target gene of the target variation. A novel, heterozygous, missense variant GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA4):c.958C>T, p.R320W was identified. An autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance was observed in the family. Multiple prediction indicate the variant in GATA4 to be deleterious. Molecular dynamics simulation further revealed that the variation of p.R320W could prevent the zinc finger of GATA4 from interacting with the DNA. Dual-Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated a significant decrease in transcriptional activity (0.90{+/-}0.099 vs 1.50{+/-}0.079, p = 0.001) of the variant GATA4 compared with the wild type.

To better understand the role of the SC in meiosis, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to construct three in-frame deletions within the predicted coiled-coil region of the C(3)G protein. These three deletion mutants disrupt SC maintenance at different times during pachytene and exhibit distinct defects in key meiotic processes, allowing us to define the stages of pachytene when the SC is necessary for homolog pairing and recombination. Our studies demonstrate that the X chromosome and the autosomes display substantially different defects in pairing and recombination when SC structure is disrupted, suggesting that the X chromosome is potentially regulated differently than the autosomes.",

Imputation achieved an average of 97% concordance between genotyped and imputed STR genotypes in an external dataset compared to 63% expected under a random model. Performance varied widely across STRs, with near perfect concordance at bi-allelic STRs vs. 70% at highly polymorphic forensics markers. We demonstrate that imputation increases power over individual SNPs to detect STR associations using simulated phenotypes and gene expression data. This resource will enable the first large-scale STR association studies using existing SNP datasets, and will likely yield new insights into complex traits.",

    "abstract": "The segregated properties of the visual system processing central or peripheral regions of the visual field have been widely studied in the visual cortex and the LGN, but rarely reported in retina. The retina performs complex computational strategies to extract spatial-temporal features that are in coherence with animal behavior and survival. Even if a big effort has been done to functionally characterize different retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types, a clear account of the particular functionality of central and peripheral cells is still missing. Here, using electrophysiological data obtained with a 256-MEA recording system on female diurnal rodent retinas (Octodon degus), we evidenced that peripheral RGCs have larger receptive fields, more sustained, faster and shorter temporal responses and sensitive to higher temporal frequencies with a broader frequency bandwidth than the center. Additionally, we also compared the asymmetries between ON and OFF cell populations present in each region, reporting that these asymmetries are dependent on the eccentricity. Finally, the presence of the asymmetries here reported emphasizes even more the complexity of computational strategies performed by the retina, which could serve as inspiration for the development of artificial visual systems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThreat detection is essential for protecting individuals from precarious situations. Early studies suggested a network of amygdala, limbic regions and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) involved in fear processing. Excitability regulation in the dmPFC might be crucial for physiological fear processing, while an abnormal excitability pattern could lead to mental illness. Non-invasive paradigms to measure excitability regulation during fear processing in humans are missing.\\n\\nMethodsWe adapted an experimental approach of excitability characterization using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the dmPFC during an instructed fear paradigm to dynamically dissect its role in fear processing. Event-related (ERP) and TMS-evoked potentials (TEP) were analyzed to trace dmPFC excitability in healthy young volunteers (n = 40, age = 27.6 {+/-} 5.7 years, 22 females). Moreover, we linked the excitability regulation patterns to individual structural MRI-derived properties of gray matter microstructural integrity of the fear network.\\n\\nResultsAn increased cortical excitability was demonstrated in the threat (T) condition in comparison to no-threat (NT) as showed by increased amplitude of evoked potentials. Furthermore, TMS over the dmPFC induced markedly increased evoked responses during T condition in relation to NT. Moreover, we found that the structural integrity of the dmPFC and the amygdala predict excitability regulation patterns as measured by ERP and TEP during fear processing.\\n\\nConclusionsWe describe the dynamic range of excitability regulation in dmPFC during fear processing. The applied paradigm can be used to non-invasively track response abnormalities to threat stimuli in healthy subjects or patients with mental disorders.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe study of microbiomes using whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing enables the analysis of uncultivated microbial populations that may have important roles in their environments. Extracting individual draft genomes (bins) facilitates metagenomic analysis at the single genome level. Software and pipelines for such analysis have become diverse and sophisticated, resulting in a significant burden for biologists to access and use them. Furthermore, while bin extraction algorithms are rapidly improving, there is still a lack of tools for their evaluation and visualization.\\n\\nResultsTo address these challenges, we present metaWRAP, a modular pipeline software for shotgun metagenomic data analysis. MetaWRAP deploys state-of-the-art software to handle metagenomic data processing starting from raw sequencing reads and ending in metagenomic bins and their analysis. MetaWRAP is flexible enough to give investigators control over the analysis, while still being easy-to-install and easy-to-use. It includes hybrid algorithms that leverage the strengths of a variety of software to extract and refine high-quality bins from metagenomic data through bin consolidation and reassembly. MetaWRAPs hybrid bin extraction algorithm outperforms individual binning approaches and other bin consolidation programs in both synthetic and real datasets. Finally, metaWRAP comes with numerous modules for the analysis of metagenomic bins, including taxonomy assignment, abundance estimation, functional annotation, and visualization.\\n\\nConclusionsMetaWRAP is an easy-to-use modular pipeline that automates the core tasks in metagenomic analysis, while contributing significant improvements to the extraction and interpretation of high-quality metagenomic bins. The bin refinement and reassembly modules of metaWRAP consistently outperform other binning approaches. Each module of metaWRAP is also a standalone component, making it a flexible and versatile tool for tackling metagenomic shotgun sequencing data. MetaWRAP is open-source software available at https://github.com/bxlab/metaWRAP.",
