    "abstract": "The Gene Ontology (GO) database contains GO terms that describe biological functions of genes. Previous methods for comparing GO terms have relied on the fact that GO terms are organized into a tree structure. In this paradigm, the locations of two GO terms in the tree dictate their similarity score. In this paper, we introduce two new solutions for this problem, by focusing instead on the definitions of the GO terms. We apply neural network based techniques from the natural language processing (NLP) domain. The first method does not rely on the GO tree, whereas the second indirectly depends on the GO tree. In our first approach, we compare two GO definitions by treating them as two unordered sets of words. The word similarity is estimated by a word embedding model that maps words into an N-dimensional space. In our second approach, we account for the word-ordering within a sentence. We use a sentence encoder to embed GO definitions into vectors and estimate how likely one definition entails another. We validate our methods in two ways. In the first experiment, we test the models ability to differentiate a true protein-protein network from a randomly generated network. In the second experiment, we test the model in identifying orthologs from randomly-matched genes in human, mouse, and fly. In both experiments, a hybrid of NLP and GO-tree based method achieves the best classification accuracy.\\n\\nAvailabilitygithub.com/datduong/NLPMethods2CompareGOterms",

    "abstract": "Seed systems are critical for deployment of improved varieties, but also serve as major conduits for the spread of seed-borne pathogens. We evaluated the structure of an informal sweetpotato seed system for its vulnerability to the spread of epidemics, and its utility for disseminating improved varieties. During the 2014 growing season, vine sellers were surveyed weekly in the Gulu Region of Northern Uganda. Our analysis draws on tools from network theory to evaluate the potential for epidemic spread in this region. Using empirical seed transaction data and estimated spatial spread, we constructed a network of seed and pathogen movement. We modeled the introduction of a pathogen, and evaluated the influence of both epidemic starting point and quarantine treatments on epidemic progress. Quarantine of 30 out of 99 villages reduced epidemic progress by up to 66%, when compared to the control (no quarantine), over 20 time steps. The starting position in the network was critical for epidemic progress and final epidemic outcomes, and influenced the percent control conferred by quarantine treatments. Considering equal likelihood of any node being an introduction point for a new epidemic, villages of particular utility for disease monitoring were identified. Sensitivity analysis identified important parameters and priorities for future data collection. The efficacy of node degree, closeness, and eigenvector centrality was similar for selecting quarantine locations, while betweenness had more limited utility. This analysis framework can be applied to provide recommendations for a wide variety of seed systems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is becoming an increasingly accessible technique, used widely for both fundamental and disease-oriented research. Library preparation methods benefit from a variety of available kits, polymerases and bisulfite conversion protocols. Although some steps in the procedure, such as PCR amplification, are known to introduce biases, a systematic evaluation of biases in WGBS strategies is missing.\\n\\nResultsWe perform a comparative analysis of several commonly used pre-and post-bisulfite WGBS library preparation protocols for their performance and quality of sequencing outputs. Our results show that bisulfite conversion per se is the main trigger of pronounced sequencing biases, and PCR amplification builds on these underlying artefacts. The majority of standard library preparation methods yield a significantly biased sequence output and overestimate global methylation. Importantly, both absolute and relative methylation levels at specific genomic regions vary substantially between methods, with clear implications for DNA methylation studies.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show that amplification-free library preparation is the least biased approach for WGBS. In protocols with amplification, the choice of BS conversion protocol or polymerase can significantly minimize artefacts. To aid with the quality assessment of existing WGBS datasets, we have integrated a bias diagnostic tool in the Bismark package and offer several approaches for consideration during the preparation and analysis of WGBS datasets.",

Here, in our study of healthy human participants, we characterize two constraints on this learning process: the size of adaptive corrections is only related to error size when errors are smaller than 6{degrees}, and learning functions converge to a similar level of asymptotic learning over a wide range of error sizes. These findings are problematic for current models of sensorimotor adaptation, and point to a new theoretical perspective in which learning is constrained by the size of the error correction, rather than sensitivity to error.",

    "abstract": "Despite considerable efforts, no physical mechanism has been shown to explain N-terminal codon bias in prokaryotic genomes. Using a systematic study of synonymous substitutions in two endogenous E. coli genes, we show that interactions between the coding region and the upstream Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence modulate the efficiency of translation initiation, affecting both intracellular mRNA and protein levels due to the inherent coupling of transcription and translation in E. coli. We further demonstrate that far-downstream mutations can also modulate mRNA levels by occluding the SD sequence through the formation of non-equilibrium secondary structures. By contrast, a non-endogenous RNA polymerase that decouples transcription and translation largely alleviates the effects of synonymous substitutions on mRNA levels. Finally, a complementary statistical analysis of the E. coli genome specifically implicates avoidance of intra-molecular base-pairing with the SD sequence. Our results provide general physical insights into the coding-level features that optimize protein expression in prokaryotes.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, transcription factors (TFs) are thought to act in a combinatorial way, by competing and collaborating to regulate common target genes. However, several questions remain regarding the conservation of these combina-tions among different gene classes, regulatory regions and cell types. We propose a new approach named TFcoop to infer the TF combinations involved in the binding of a tar-get TF in a particular cell type. TFcoop aims to predict the binding sites of the target TF upon the binding affinity of all identified cooperating TFs. The set of cooperating TFs and model parameters are learned from ChIP-seq data of the target TF. We used TFcoop to investigate the TF combina-tions involved in the binding of 106 TFs on 41 cell types and in four regulatory regions: promoters of mRNAs, lncRNAs and pri-miRNAs, and enhancers. We first assess that TFcoop is accurate and outperforms simple PWM methods for pre-dicting TF binding sites. Next, analysis of the learned models sheds light on important properties of TF combinations in different promoter classes and in enhancers. First, we show that combinations governing TF binding on enhancers are more cell-type specific than that governing binding in pro-moters. Second, for a given TF and cell type, we observe that TF combinations are different between promoters and en-hancers, but similar for promoters of mRNAs, lncRNAs and pri-miRNAs. Analysis of the TFs cooperating with the dif-ferent targets show over-representation of pioneer TFs and a clear preference for TFs with binding motif composition similar to that of the target. Lastly, our models accurately dis-tinguish promoters associated with specific biological processes.",

We hypothesized that these time scales relate to kinetic barriers inherent to the nucleation of ordered phases. To investigate nucleation barriers in living cells, we developed Distributed Amphifluoric FRET (DAmFRET). DAmFRET exploits a photoconvertible fluorophore, heterogeneous expression, and large cell numbers to quantify via flow cytometry the extent of a proteins self-assembly as a function of cellular concentration. We show that kinetic barriers limit the nucleation of ordered self-assemblies, and that the persistence of the barriers with respect to concentration relates to structure. Supersaturation resulting from sequence-encoded nucleation barriers gave rise to prion behavior, and enabled a prion-forming protein, Sup35 PrD, to partition into dynamic intracellular condensates or to form toxic aggregates.

    "abstract": "Drug susceptibility, defined by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), often does not predict whether fungal infections will respond to therapy in the clinic. Tolerance at supra-MIC antifungal drug concentrations is rarely quantified and current clinical recommendations suggest it be ignored. Here, we measured and characterized drug-response variables that could influence the outcomes of fungal infections and be generalizable across major clades of Candida albicans, one of the most frequently isolated human fungal pathogens. We quantified antifungal tolerance as the fraction of growth (FoG) above the MIC and found that it is clearly distinct from susceptibility/resistance measured as MIC. Instead, tolerance is due to the slow growth of subpopulations of cells that overcome drug stress more efficiently than the rest of the population, and correlates inversely with the accumulation of intracellular drug. Importantly, many adjuvant drugs used together with fluconazole, a fungistatic drug, reduce tolerance without affecting resistance. These include inhibitors of major stress response hubs such as Hsp90, calcineurin, PKC1 and TOR. Accordingly, in an invertebrate infection model, adjuvant combination therapy was significantly more effective than fluconazole alone in treating highly tolerant isolates and did not improve the treatment of isolates with low tolerance levels. Furthermore, isolates recovered from immunocompetent patients with persistent candidemia displayed significantly higher tolerance than isolates that were readily cleared by fluconazole. Thus, tolerance correlates with the response to fluconazole therapy in patients and may help predict whether infections will respond to fluconazole alone. Similarly, measuring tolerance may provide a useful clinical parameter for choosing appropriate therapeutic strategies to overcome persistent clinical candidemia.",

    "abstract": "Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) initiates a broad transcriptional response to proteotoxic stress while also mediating a cancer-specific transcriptional program. HSF1 is thought to be regulated by molecular chaperones, including Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90). HSP90 is proposed to sequester HSF1 in unstressed cells, but visualization of this interaction in vivo requires protein crosslinking. In this report, we show that HSP90 binding to HSF1 depends on HSP90 conformation and is only readily visualized for the ATP-dependent, N-domain dimerized chaperone, a conformation only rarely sampled by mammalian HSP90. We have used this mutationally fixed conformation to map HSP90 binding sites on HSF1. Further, we show that ATP-competitive, N-domain targeted HSP90 inhibitors disrupt this interaction, resulting in the increased duration of HSF1 occupancy of the hsp70 promoter and significant prolongation of both the constitutive and heat-induced HSF1 transcriptional activity. While our data do not support a role for HSP90 in sequestering HSF1 monomers to suppress HSF1 transcriptional activity, our findings do identify a noncanonical role for HSP90 in providing dynamic modulation of HSF1 activity by participating in removal of HSF1 trimers from heat shock elements in DNA, thus terminating the heat shock response.",

Deletion of clk-1 was lethal in mice, and its mutation in C. elegans mildly extended lifespan, slowed physiological rate and led to sickness. We found that if growth retardation was taken into account the average lifespan of clk-1 mutants would not be prolonged or would be shortened. In addition, recent study showed that knocking down of clk-1 shortened lifespan. Although the extension of lifespan in clk-1 mutants was mild and was not observed sometimes, some progenies indeed had prolonged maximum lifespan even if retardation of growth was taking into account. These paradoxes implicate the existence of individual specificity in the aging process even in the same cohort, just like a drug is beneficial for some people while for others it is detrimental. We further categorized lifespan curves into five kinds of patterns according to the lifespan alternations observed in organisms: N (normal); L (long-lived); S (short-lived); F (flattened); ST (steepened), and found that the curve of clk-1 mutants fit into the F pattern.

    "abstract": "Personality neuroscience aims to find associations between brain measures and personality traits. Findings to date have been severely limited by a number of factors, including small sample size and omission of out-of-sample prediction. We capitalized on the recent availability of a large database, together with the emergence of specific criteria for best practices in neuroimaging studies of individual differences. We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 884 young healthy adults in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database. We attempted to predict personality traits from the \\\"Big Five\\\", as assessed with the NEO-FFI test, using individual functional connectivity matrices. After regressing out potential confounds (such as age, sex, handedness and fluid intelligence), we used a cross-validated framework, together with test-retest replication (across two sessions of resting-state fMRI for each subject), to quantify how well the neuroimaging data could predict each of the five personality factors. We tested three different (published) denoising strategies for the fMRI data, two inter-subject alignment and brain parcellation schemes, and three different linear models for prediction. As measurement noise is known to moderate statistical relationships, we performed final prediction analyses using average connectivity across both imaging sessions (1 h of data), with the analysis pipeline that yielded the highest predictability overall. Across all results (test/retest; 3 denoising strategies; 2 alignment schemes; 3 models), Openness to experience emerged as the only reliably predicted personality factor. Using the full hour of resting-state data and the best pipeline, we could predict Openness to experience (NEOFAC_O: r=0.24, R2=0.024) almost as well as we could predict the score on a 24-item intelligence test (PMAT24_A_CR: r=0.26, R2=0.044). Other factors (Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness) yielded weaker predictions across results that were not statistically significant under permutation testing. We also derived two superordinate personality factors (\\\"\\\" and \\\"{beta}\\\") from a principal components analysis of the NEO-FFI factor scores, thereby reducing noise and enhancing the precision of these measures of personality. We could account for 5% of the variance in the {beta} superordinate factor (r=0.27, R2=0.050), which loads highly on Openness to experience. We conclude with a discussion of the potential for predicting personality from neuroimaging data and make specific recommendations for the field.",

Descriptions of this macromolecular complex have been proposed at different scales of approximation. Here, we introduce a methodology to generate a structured volumetric mesh of icosahedral viral capsids (CapsidMesh) based on the atomic positions of their constituents. Material properties of the capsid proteins can be set on every mesh element individually. Hence, we have control over all levels of protein structure (atoms, amino acids, subunits, oligomers,capsid). The CapsidMesh models are suitable for numerical simulations and analysis of a physical process using a third-party package. In particular, we used our methodology to generate a CapsidMesh of several capsids previously characterized by Atomic Force Microscopy experiments, and then simulated the mechanical nanoindentation through the Finite Element Method. By fitting to the experimental linear elastic response, we estimated the elastic modulus and mechanical stresses produced on the capsids. Our results show that the atomic detail of the CapsidMesh is sufficient to reproduce anisotropic properties of the particle.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrevious research shows that men often receive more research funding than women, but does not provide empirical evidence as to why this occurs. In 2014, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) created a natural experiment by dividing all investigator-initiated funding into two new grant programs: one with and one without an explicit review focus on the caliber of the principal investigator.\\n\\nMethodsWe analyzed application success among 23,918 grant applications from 7,093 unique principal investigators in a 5-year natural experiment across all investigator-initiated CIHR grant programs in 2011-2016. We used Generalized Estimating Equations to account for multiple applications by the same applicant and an interaction term between each principal investigators self-reported sex and grant programs to compare success rates between male and female applicants under different review criteria.\\n\\nResultsThe overall grant success rate across all competitions was 15.8%. After adjusting for age and research domain, the predicted probability of funding success in traditional programs was 0.9 percentage points higher for male than for female principal investigators (OR 0.934, 95% CI 0.854-1.022). In the new program focused on the proposed science, the gap was 0.9 percentage points in favour of male principal investigators (OR 0.998, 95% CI 0.794-1.229). In the new program with an explicit review focus on the caliber of the principal investigator, the gap was 4.0 percentage points in favour of male principal investigators (OR 0.705, 95% CI 0.519- 0.960).\\n\\nInterpretationThis study suggests gender gaps in grant funding are attributable to less favourable assessments of women as principal investigators, not differences in assessments of the quality of science led by women. We propose ways for funders to avoid allowing gender bias to influence research funding.\\n\\nFundingThis study was unfunded.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome evolution, an important component of mico- and macroevolutionary dynamics 1-5, presents an enigma in the mega-diverse Lepidoptera6. While most species exhibit constrained chromosome evolution, with nearly identical haploid chromosome counts and chromosome-level shared gene content and collinearity among species despite more than 140 Million years of divergence7, a small fraction of species independently exhibit dramatic changes in chromosomal count due to extensive fission and fusion events that are facilitated by their holocentric chromosomes7-9. Here we address this enigma of simultaneous conservation and dynamism in chromosome evolution in our analysis of the chromonome (chromosome level assembly10) of the green-veined white butterfly, Pieris napi (Pieridae, Linnaeus, 1758). We report an unprecedented reorganization of the standard Lepidopteran chromosome structure via more than 90 fission and fusion events that are cryptic at other scales, as the haploid chromosome number is identical to related genera and gene collinearity within the large rearranged segments matches other Lepidoptera. Furthermore, these rearranged segments are significantly enriched for clusters of functionally related genes and the maintenance of ancient telomeric ends. These results suggest an unexpected role for selection in shaping chromosomal evolution when the structural constraints of monocentricq chromosomes are relaxed.",

    "abstract": "Filamentous fungi are important cellular factories for the production and secretion of homologous and heterologous enzymes such as carbohydrate-active enzymes. However, the regulation of protein secretion in these microorganisms requires more profound studies since the enzyme levels produced are usually below the levels required by industry for profitable processes. Genomic and transcriptomic approaches have been used to understand the overexpression and production of heterologous enzymes and their capacity to induce different cellular biological processes. To investigate this regulation, Aspergillus nidulans recombinant strains were analyzed by transcriptomics. We designed three A. nidulans recombinant strains producing the following heterologous proteins: alpha-arabinofuranosidase (AbfA), beta-glucosidase (BglC) and thermophilic mannanase (Tp-Man5). The heterologous genes abfA and bglC were highly expressed, while tp-man5 mRNA levels were low and similar to those of a reference gene. There was an indirect relationship between mRNA and protein secretion levels, suggesting that transcription is not a bottleneck for target gene expression in this system. Despite the distinct features of the recombinant proteins, 30 differentially expressed genes were common to all the recombinant strains, suggesting that these genes represent a general response to the expression of heterologous genes. We also showed that the early activation of the canonical unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway by hacA alternative splicing was normalized after 8h, except in the strain expressing BglC, suggesting either no accumulation of the BglC misfolded form or the presence of an alternative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and UPR pathway. Finally, to focus our analysis on the secretion pathway, a set of 374 genes was further evaluated. Seventeen genes were common to all the recombinant strains, suggesting again that these genes represent a general response of A. nidulans cells to the overexpression of recombinant genes, even thermophilic genes. Additionally, we reported the possible genetic interactions of these 17 genes based on coexpression network calculations. Interestingly, protein improvements are nongeneric, and improvements in the production of one target protein are not necessarily transferable to another one. Thus, this study may provide genetic and cellular background and targets for genetic manipulation to improve protein secretion by A. nidulans.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a prevalent multifactorial disease of women in their reproductive years characterized by a shift from the Lactobacillus spp. dominated microbial community towards a taxonomically diverse anaerobic community. For unknown reasons, some women do not respond to therapy. In our recent clinical study, out of 37 women diagnosed with BV, 31 were successfully treated with metronidazole, while 6 still had BV after treatment. To discover possible reasons for the lack of response in those patients, we performed a metatranscriptome analysis of their vaginal microbiota, comparing them to patients who responded. Seven out of 8 Cas genes of Gardnerella vaginalis were highly up-regulated in non-responding patients. Cas genes, in addition to protecting against phages, might be involved in DNA repair thus mitigating the bactericidal effect of DNA damaging agents like metronidazole. In the second part of our study, we analyzed the vaginal metatranscriptomes of four patients over three months and showed high in vivo expression of genes for pore-forming toxins in L. iners and of genes encoding enzymes for the production of hydrogen peroxide and D-lactate in L. crispatus.",

Some of these elements integrate in the chromosome, whereas others replicate autonomously as plasmids. Recent works showed the existence of few differences, and occasional interconversion, between the two types of elements. Here, we enquired on why evolutionary processes have maintained the two types of mobile genetic elements by comparing integrative and conjugative elements (ICE) with extrachromosomal ones (conjugative plasmids) of the highly abundant MPFT conjugative type. We observed that plasmids encode more replicases, partition systems, and antibiotic resistance genes, whereas ICEs encode more integrases and metabolism-associated genes. ICEs and plasmids have similar average sizes, but plasmids are much more variable, have more DNA repeats, and exchange genes more frequently. On the other hand, we found that ICEs are more frequently transferred between distant taxa. We propose a model where differential plasticity and transmissibility range explain the co-occurrence of integrative and extra-chromosomal elements in microbial populations. In particular, the conversion from ICE to plasmid allows ICE to be more plastic, while the conversion from plasmid to ICE allows the expansion of the element s host range.",

One challenge arises during mitosis when chromatin becomes condensed and transcription is shut off. How do the daughter cells re-establish the original transcription program? Here, we report that the TATA-binding protein (TBP), a key component of the core transcriptional machinery, remains bound globally to active promoters in ES cells during mitosis. Using live-cell single-molecule imaging, we observed that TBP mitotic binding is highly stable, with an average residence time of minutes. This stable binding is in stark contrast to typical TFs with residence times of seconds. To test the functional effect of mitotic TBP binding, we used a drug-inducible degron system and found that TBP promotes the association of RNA Polymerase II with mitotic chromosomes, and facilitates transcriptional reactivation following mitosis. These results suggest that the core transcriptional machinery maintains global transcriptional memory during mitosis.",

    "abstract": "Modern microscopy modalities create a data deluge with gigabytes of data generated each second, and terabytes per day. Storing and processing these data is a severe bottleneck, not fully alleviated by data compression. We argue that this is because images are processed as regular grids of pixels. To address the root of the problem, we here propose a content-adaptive representation of fluorescence microscopy images called the Adaptive Particle Representation (APR). The APR replaces the regular grid of pixels with particles positioned according to image content. This overcomes storage bottlenecks, as data compression does, but additionally overcomes memory and processing bottlenecks, since the APR can directly be used in processing without going back to pixels. We present the ideas, concepts, and algorithms of the APR and validate them using noisy 3D image data. We show that the APR represents the content of an image while maintaining image quality. We then show that the adaptivity of the APR provides orders of magnitude benefits across a range of image processing tasks. Therefore, the APR provides a simple, extendable, and efficient content-aware representation of images that relaxes current data and processing bottlenecks.",

However, a systematic assessment of the various sources of missing values and strategies to handle these data has received little attention. Missing data can occur systematically, e.g. from run day-dependent effects due to limits of detection (LOD); or it can be random as, for instance, a consequence of sample preparation.\\n\\nMETHODSWe investigated patterns of missing data in an MS-based metabolomics experiment of serum samples from the German KORA F4 cohort (n = 1750). We then evaluated 31 imputation methods in a simulation framework and biologically validated the results by applying all imputation approaches to real metabolomics data. We examined the ability of each method to reconstruct biochemical pathways from data-driven correlation networks, and the ability of the method to increase statistical power while preserving the strength of established genetically metabolic quantitative trait loci.\\n\\nRESULTSRun day-dependent LOD-based missing data accounts for most missing values in the metabolomics dataset.

On the premise that the integration of a replicon within the cell cycle is key to deciphering its essential nature, we show that the content in genes involved in the replication, partition and segregation of the replicons and in the cell cycle discriminates the bacterial replicons into chromosomes, plasmids, and another class of essential genomic elements that function as chromosomes. These latter do not derive directly from plasmids. Rather, they arise from the fission of a multi-replicon molecule corresponding to the co-integrated and rearranged ancestral chromosome and plasmid. All essential replicons in a distributed genome are thus neochromosomes. Having a distributed genome appears to extend and accelerate the exploration of the bacterial genome evolutionary landscape, producing complex regulation and leading to novel eco-phenotypes and species diversification.",

    "abstract": "Protein sequence matching does not properly account for some well-known features of protein structures: surface residues being more variable than core residues, the high packing densities in globular proteins, and does not yield good matches of sequences of many proteins known to be close structural relatives. There are now abundant protein sequences and structures to enable major improvements to sequence matching. Here, we utilize structural frameworks to mount the observed correlated sequences to identify the most important correlated parts. The rationale is that protein structures provide the important physical framework for improving sequence matching. Combining the sequence and structure data in this way leads to a simple amino acid substitution matrix that can be readily incorporated into any sequence matching. This enables the incorporation of allosteric information into sequence matching and transforms it effectively from a 1-D to a 3-D procedure. The results from testing in over 3,000 sequence matches demonstrate a 37% gain in sequence similarity and a loss of 26% of the gaps when compared with the use of BLOSUM62. And, importantly there are major gains in the specificity of sequence matching across diverse proteins.

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11) is a rare, dominantly inherited human ataxia characterized by atrophy of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. SCA11 is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the Serine/Threonine kinase Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) that result in premature truncations of the protein. We previously showed that TTBK2 is a key regulator of the assembly of primary cilia in vivo. However, the mechanisms by which the SCA11-associated mutations disrupt TTBK2 function, and whether they interfere with ciliogenesis were unknown. In this work, we present evidence that SCA11-associated mutations are dominant negative alleles and that the resulting truncated protein (TTBK2SCA11) interferes with the function of full length TTBK2 in mediating ciliogenesis. A Ttbk2 allelic series revealed that upon partial reduction of full length TTBK2 function, TTBK2SCA11 can interfere with the activity of the residual wild-type protein to decrease cilia number and interrupt cilia-dependent Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling. Our studies have also revealed new functions for TTBK2 after cilia initiation in the control of cilia length, trafficking of a subset of SHH pathway components, including Smoothened (SMO), and cilia stability. These studies provide a molecular foundation to understand the cellular and molecular pathogenesis of human SCA11, and help account for the link between ciliary dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDefects in primary cilia structure and function are linked to a number of recessive genetic disorders, now collectively referred to as ciliopathies. Most of the characteristics of these disorders arise from disruptions to embryonic development, with the requirements for primary cilia in adult tissues being less well-defined. We previously showed that a kinase associated with an adult-onset neurodegenerative condition is required for cilium assembly and ciliary signaling during development. Here, we show that the human disease-associated mutations act as mild dominant negatives, interfering with the function of the full length protein in cilia formation and ciliary signaling.",

    "abstract": "Allele frequency data from human reference populations is of increasing value for filtering and assignment of pathogenicity to genetic variants. Aged and healthy populations are more likely to be selectively depleted of pathogenic alleles, and therefore particularly suitable as a reference populations for the major diseases of clinical and public health importance. However, reference studies of the healthy elderly have remained under-represented in human genetics. We have developed the Medical Genome Reference Bank (MGRB), a large-scale comprehensive whole-genome dataset of confirmed healthy elderly individuals, to provide a publicly accessible resource for health-related research, and for clinical genetics. It also represents a useful resource for studying the genetics of healthy aging. The MGRB comprises 4,000 healthy, older individuals with no reported history of cancer, cardiovascular disease or dementia, recruited from two Australian community-based cohorts. DNA derived from blood samples will be subject to whole genome sequencing. The MGRB will measure genome-wide genetic variation in 4,000 individuals, mostly of European decent, aged 60-95 years (mean age [&ge;] 75 years). The MGRB has committed to a policy of data sharing, employing a hierarchical data management system to maintain participant privacy and confidentiality, whilst maximizing research and clinical usage of the database. The MGRB will represent a dataset of international significance, broadly accessible to the clinical and genetic research community.",

    "abstract": "Protein Lys methylation plays a critical role in numerous cellular processes, yet it has been challenging to identify Lys methylation in a systematic manner. We present here an approach combining in silico prediction with targeted mass spectrometry (MS) to identify Lys methylation (Kme) sites at the proteome level. We have developed MethylSight, a program that predicts Kme events solely on physicochemical and biochemical properties of putative methylation sites, which can then be validated by targeted MS. Using this approach, we have identified 70 new histone Kme marks with a 90% validation rate. H2BK43me2, which undergoes dynamic changes during stem cell differentiation, is found to be a substrate of KDM5b. Furthermore, MethylSight predicts ~50,000 Kme sites in non-histone proteins with high confidence, suggesting that Lys methylation is a prevalent post-translational modification. Our work provides a useful resource for systematic exploration of the role of Lys methylation in human health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive exploration of the diversity of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) systems, biological applications have been mostly confined to Class 2 systems, specifically the Cas9 and Cas12 (formerly Cpf1) single effector proteins. A key limitation of exploring and utilizing other CRISPR-Cas systems with unique functionalities, particularly Class I types and their multi-protein effector complex, is the knowledge of the systems protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence identity. In this work, we developed a systematic pipeline, named CASPERpam, that enables us to comprehensively assess the PAM sequences of all the available CRISPR-Cas systems in the NCBI database of bacterial genomes. The CASPERpam analysis revealed that within the 30,389 assemblies previously screen for CRISPR arrays, there exists 26,364 spacers that match somewhere in the viral, bacterial, and plasmid databases of NCBI, using the constraints of 95% sequence identity and 95% sequence coverage for blast hits. When grouping these results by species, we were able to identify putative PAM sequences for 1,049 among 1,493 unique species. The remaining species either have insufficient data or an undetermined result from the analysis. Finally, we were able to infer certain design principles that are relevant for understanding PAM diversity and a baseline for further experimental studies including PAM assays. We envision CASPERpam is a useful bioinformatic tool for understanding and harnessing the diversity of CRISPR systems.",

    "abstract": "RNA recognition motif-type RNA-binding domain containing proteins (RBDPs) participate in RNA metabolism including regulating mRNA stability, nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, and splicing. Rbm45 is an RBDP first cloned from rat brain and expressed spatiotemporally during rat neural development. More recently, RBM45 has been associated with pathological aggregates in the human neurological disorders amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and Alzheimers. Rbm45 and the neural developmental protein musashi-1 are in the same family of RDBPs and have similar expression patterns. In contrast to Musashi-1, which is upregulated during colorectal carcinogenesis, we found no association of RBM45 overexpression in human colon cancer tissue. In order to begin characterizing RNA-binding partners of Rbm45, we have successfully cloned and expressed human RBM45 in an Intein fusion-protein expression system. Furthermore, to gain a better understanding of the molecular genetics and evolution of Rbm45, we used an in silico approach to analyze the gene structure of the human and mouse Rbm45 homologues and explored the evolutionary conservation of Rbm45 in metazoans. Human RBM45 and mouse Rbm45 span {bsim}17 kb and 13 kb, respectively, and contain 10 exons, one of which is non-coding. Both genes have TATA-less promoters with an initiator and a GC-rich element. Downstream of exon 10, both homologues have canonical polyadenylation signals and an embryonic cytoplasmic polyadenylation element. Moreover, our data indicate Rbm45 is conserved across all metazoan taxa from sponges (phylum Porifera) to humans (phylum Chordata), portending a fundamental role in metazoan development.",

Here, we cloned two Rec8-like homoeologous genes (homoeoalleles) from tetraploid wheat (TtRec8-A1 and TtRec8-B1) and one from hexaploid wheat (TaRec8-D1), and performed expression and functional analyses of the homoeoalleles. Also, we identified other two Rec8 homoeoalleles in hexaploid wheat (TaRec8-A1 and TaRec8-B1) and the one in Aegilops tauschii (AetRec8-D1) by comparative analysis. The coding DNA sequences (CDS) of these six Rec8 homoeoalleles are all 1,827 bp in length, encoding 608 amino acids. They differed from each other primarily in introns although single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in CDS. Substantial difference was observed between the homoeoalleles from the subgenome B (TtRec8-B1 and TaRec8-B1) and those from the subgenomes A and D (TtRec8-A1, TaRec8-A1, and TaRec8-D1). TtRec8-A1 expressed dominantly over TtRec8-B1, but comparably to TaRec8-D1. Therefore, the Rec8 homoeoalleles from the subgenomes A and D may be functionally more active than the one from the subgenome B in wheat. The structural variation and differential expression of the Rec8 homoeoalleles indicate a unique cross-genome coordination of the homoeologous genes in the polyploid, and imply the distinction of the wheat subgenome B from other subgenomes in the origin and evolution.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTThis work revealed the structural and expression patterns of the Rec8-like homoeologous genes in polyploid wheat, implying a unique origin and evolutionary route of the wheat B subgenome.",

    "abstract": "Population growth curves of Escherichia coli (E. coli) cultures propagated in spaceflight environments demonstrate an extended log phase duration and an increased final cell concentration compared to E. coli cultures grown on Earth. We suggest that during spaceflight, a lack of convective mixing in the growth medium alters a cells microenvironment such that the cell at first devotes its resources primarily to motility and later shifts most of its resources to reproduction. As flagellin is the major protein component of flagella, the motility structure of E. coli, we propose that the expression of the flagellin gene (fliC) can be used as a diagnostic marker for determining if the bacterium is in fact altering its allocation of cellular resources to motility during specific growth phases. We have used semiquantitative RT-PCR to analyze the expression of fliC in cultures grown in laboratory apparatus that simulate various aspects of the spaceflight environment. The data from this pilot study indicate that fliC expression increases initially under stationary, slow clinorotation, and fast clinorotation growth conditions, peaking at mid-exponential phase and decreasing dramatically in stationary phase. These data support the hypothesis that metabolic resources are being directed towards forming the flagellum, the bacteria motile structure, before shifting resources to growth, reproduction, and maintenance.",

In the absence of prophylaxis protecting human populations from emerging arboviruses transmitted by this mosquito species, the most straightforward control measures rely on the suppression or manipulation of vector natural populations. A number of environmental-friendly methods using innundative releases of sterilizing males are currently under development. However, these strategies are still lacking an efficient sexing method required for mass production of males.\\n\\nResultsWe present the first Genetic Sexing Strain (GSS) in Ae. albopictus, hereafter referred as TiCoq, obtained by sex linkage of rdl gene conferring dieldrin resistance. Hatching rate, larval survival and sex ratio were followed during twelve generations. The use of dieldrin at third larval stage allowed selecting 98% of males on average.\\n\\nConclusionA good production rate of TiCoq males makes this GSS suitable for any control method based on mass production of Ae. albopictus sterilizing males. Despite limitations resulting from affected egg hatch as well as the nature of the used insecticide, the construction of this GSS paves the way for industrial sex separation of Ae. albopictus.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWe challenge the oft-repeated claim that the beetles (Coleoptera) are the most species-rich order of animals. Instead, we assert that another order of insects, the Hymenoptera, are more speciose, due in large part to the massively diverse but relatively poorly known parasitoid wasps. The idea that the beetles have more species than other orders is primarily based on their respective collection histories and the relative availability of taxonomic resources, which both disfavor parasitoid wasps. Though it is unreasonable to directly compare numbers of described species in each order, the ecology of parasitic wasps - specifically, their intimate interactions with their hosts - allows for estimation of relative richness. We present a simple logical model that shows how the specialization of many parasitic wasps on their hosts suggests few scenarios in which there would be more beetle species than parasitic wasp species. We couple this model with an accounting of what we call the \\\"genus-specific parasitoid-host ratio\\\" from four well-studied genera of insect hosts, a metric by which to generate extremely conservative estimates of the average number of parasitic wasp species attacking a given beetle or other insect host species. Synthesis of our model with data from real host systems suggests that the Hymenoptera may have 2.5 - 3.2x more species than the Coleoptera. While there are more described species of beetles than all other animals, the Hymenoptera are almost certainly the larger order.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) for resting state fMRI - namely spectral DCM - is a recently developed and widely adopted method for inferring effective connectivity in intrinsic brain networks. Most research applying spectral DCM has focused on group-averaged connectivity within large-scale intrinsic brain networks; however, the consistency of subject- and session-specific estimates of effective connectivity has not been evaluated. Establishing reliability (within subjects) is crucial for its clinical use; e.g., as a neurophysiological phenotype of disease progression. Effective connectivity during rest is likely to vary due to changes in cognitive, behavioural, and physical states. Determining the sources of fluctuations in effective connectivity may yield greater understanding of brain processes and inform clinical applications about potential confounds. In the present study, we investigated the consistency of effective connectivity within and between subjects, as well as potential sources of variability (e.g., hemispheric asymmetry). We further investigated how standard procedures for data processing and signal extraction affect this consistency. DCM analyses were applied to four longitudinal resting state fMRI datasets. Our sample consisted of 20 subjects with 653 resting state fMRI sessions in total. These data allowed to quantify the robustness of connectivity estimates for each subject, and to draw conclusions beyond specific data features. We found that subjects contributing to all datasets showed systematic and reliable patterns of hemispheric asymmetry. When asymmetry was taken into account, subjects showed very similar connectivity patterns. We also found that various processing procedures (e.g. global signal regression and ROI size) had little effect on inference and reliability of connectivity for the majority of subjects. Bayesian model reduction increased reliability (within-subjects) and stability (between-subjects) of connectivity patterns.",

Targeted deletion of PACAP from the PMV through stereotaxic virally mediated cre- injection or genetic cross to LepR-i-cre mice with PACAPfl/fl mice led to delayed puberty onset and impaired reproductive function in female, but not male, mice.

    "abstract": "Cross-correlations in the activity in neural networks are commonly used to characterize their dynamical states and their anatomical and functional organizations. Yet, how these latter network features affect the spatiotemporal structure of the correlations in recurrent networks is not fully understood. Here, we develop a general theory for the emergence of correlated neuronal activity from the dynamics in strongly recurrent networks consisting of several populations of binary neurons. We apply this theory to the case in which the connectivity depends on the anatomical or functional distance between the neurons. We establish the architectural conditions under which the system settles into a dynamical state where correlations are strong, highly robust and spatially modulated. We show that such strong correlations arise if the network exhibits an effective feedforward structure. We establish how this feedforward structure determines the way correlations scale with the network size and the degree of the connectivity. In networks lacking an effective feedforward structure correlations are extremely small and only weakly depend on the number of connections per neuron. Our work shows how strong correlations can be consistent with highly irregular activity in recurrent networks, two key features of neuronal dynamics in the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Clustering techniques are widely used in the analysis of large data sets to group together samples with similar properties. For example, clustering is often used in the field of single-cell RNA-sequencing in order to identify different cell types present in a tissue sample. There are many algorithms for performing clustering and the results can vary substantially. In particular, the number of groups present in a data set is often unknown and the number of clusters identified by an algorithm can change based on the parameters used. To explore and examine the impact of varying clustering resolution we present clustering trees. This visualisation shows the relationships between clusters at multiple resolutions allowing researchers to see how samples move as the number of clusters increases. In addition, meta-information can be overlaid on the tree to inform the choice of resolution and guide in identification of clusters. We illustrate the features of clustering trees using a series of simulations as well as two real examples, the classical iris dataset and a complex single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset.

    "abstract": "Identifying low-dimensional features that describe large-scale neural recordings is a major challenge in neuroscience. Repeated temporal patterns (sequences) are thought to be a salient feature of neural dynamics, but are not succinctly captured by traditional dimensionality reduction techniques. Here we describe a software toolbox--called seqNMF--with new methods for extracting informative, non-redundant, sequences from high-dimensional neural data, testing the significance of these extracted patterns, and assessing the prevalence of sequential structure in data. We test these methods on simulated data under multiple noise conditions, and on several real neural and behavioral data sets. In hippocampal data, seqNMF identifies neural sequences that match those calculated manually by reference to behavioral events. In songbird data, seqNMF discovers neural sequences in untutored birds that lack stereotyped songs. Thus, by identifying temporal structure directly from neural data, seqNMF enables dissection of complex neural circuits without relying on temporal references from stimuli or behavioral outputs.",

    "abstract": "While memory encoding and consolidation processes have been linked with dopaminergic signaling for a long time, the role of dopamine in episodic memory retrieval remained mostly unexplored. Based on previous observations of striatal activity during memory retrieval, we used pharmacological fMRI to investigate the effects of dopamine on retrieval performance and metacognitive memory confidence in healthy humans. Dopaminergic modulation by the D2 antagonist haloperidol administered acutely during the retrieval phase improved recognition accuracy of previously learned pictures significantly and was associated with increased activity in the SN/VTA, locus coeruleus, hippocampus and amygdala during retrieval. In contrast, confidence for new-decisions was impaired by unsystematically increased activity of the striatum across confidence levels and restricted range of responsiveness in frontostriatal networks under haloperidol. These findings offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying memory retrieval and metacognition and provide a broader perspective on the presence of memory problems in dopamine-related diseases and the treatment of memory disorders.",

    "abstract": "Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is a promising treatment for psychiatric and neurologic conditions, but outcomes are variable across treated individuals. This variability may be due in part to uncertainty in the selection of the stimulation site - a challenge complicated further by the variable organization of individual human brains. In principle, precise targeting of individual-specific brain areas serving outsized roles in cognition could improve the efficacy of NIBS. Network theory predicts that the importance of a node in network can be inferred from its connections; as such, we hypothesized that targeting individual-specific \\\"hub\\\" brain areas with NIBS would impact cognition more than non-hub brain areas. We first demonstrate that the spatial positioning of hubs is variable across individuals, but highly-reproducible when mapped with sufficient per-individual rsfMRI data. We then tested our hypothesis in healthy individuals using a prospective, within-subject, double-blind design. We found that inhibiting a hub with NIBS disrupted information processing during working-memory to a greater extent than inhibiting a non-hub area of the same gyrus. Furthermore, inhibition of hubs linking specific control networks and sensorimotor systems was retrospectively found to be most impactful. Based on these findings, we propose that precise mapping of individual-specific brain network features could inform future interventions in patients.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe network organization of every persons brain is different, but non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) interventions do not take this variation into account. Here we demonstrate that the spatial positions of brain areas theoretically serving important roles in cognition, called hubs, differs across individual humans, but are stable within an individual upon repeated neuroimaging. We found that administering NIBS to these individual-specific hub brain areas impacted cognition more than stimulation of non-hub areas. This finding indicates that future NIBS interventions can target individual-specific, but cognitively-relevant features of human brains.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between attention and emotion is posited to influence long-term memory consolidation. We systematically reviewed experiments investigating the influence of attention on emotional memory to determine: (i) the reported effect of attention on memory for emotional stimuli, and (ii) whether there is homogeneity between behavioural and neuroimaging based effects. Over half of the 47 included experiments found a moderate-to-large effect of attention on emotional memory as measured behaviourally. However, eye-tracking research provide mixed support for the role of attention-related processes in facilitating emotional information into long-term memory. Similarly, modulations in sensory-related components at encoding were not predictive of long-term memory formation, whereas later components appear to differentially reflect the allocation of attention to heterogeneous emotional stimuli. This dissociation in neurophysiology is paralleled by the activation of distinct neural networks under full- and divided-attention conditions. We quantified the effects of the behavioural, eye-tracking and neuroimaging findings via meta-analysis to show that the neural substrates of attention-related emotional memory enhancement may be sensitive to specific methodological parameters.",

    "abstract": "Salience is a broad and widely used concept in neuroscience whose neuronal correlates, however, remain elusive. In behavioral conditioning, salience is used to explain various effects, such as stimulus overshadowing, and refers to how fast and strongly a stimulus can be associated with a conditioned event. Here, we show that sounds of diverse quality, but equal intensity and perceptual detectability, can recruit different levels of population activity in mouse auditory cortex. When using these sounds as cues in a Go/NoGo discrimination task, the degree of cortical recruitment matches the salience parameter of a reinforcement learning model used to analyze learning speed. We test an essential prediction of this model by training mice to discriminate light-sculpted optogenetic activity patterns in auditory cortex, and verify that cortical recruitment causally determines association or overshadowing of the stimulus components. This demonstrates that cortical recruitment underlies major aspects of stimulus salience during reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) have many advantages as molecular markers since they are ubiquitous and co-dominant. However, the discovery of true SNPs especially in polyploid species is difficult. Peanut is an allopolyploid, which has a very low rate of true SNP calling. A large set of true and false SNPs identified from the Arachis 58k Affymetrix array was leveraged to train machine learning models to select true SNPs straight from sequence data. These models achieved accuracy rates of above 80% using real peanut RNA-seq and whole genome shotgun (WGS) re-sequencing data, which is higher than previously reported for polyploids. A 48K SNP array, Axiom Arachis2, was designed using the approach which revealed 75% accuracy of calling SNPs from different tetraploid peanut genotypes. Using the method to simulate SNP variation in peanut, cotton, wheat, and strawberry, we show that models built with our parameter sets achieve above 98% accuracy in selecting true SNPs. Additionally, models built with simulated genotypes were able to select true SNPs at above 80% accuracy using real peanut data, demonstrating that our model can be used even if real data are not available to train the models. This work demonstrates an effective approach for calling highly reliable SNPs from polyploids using machine learning. A novel tool was developed for predicting true SNPs from sequence data, designated as SNP-ML (SNP-Machine Learning, pronounced \\\"snip mill\\\"), using the described models. SNP-ML additionally provides functionality to train new models not included in this study for customized use, designated SNP-MLer (SNP-Machine Learner, pronounced \\\"snip miller\\\").

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that introducing C4 photosynthesis into C3 crops would increase yield. The simplest scheme in- volves concentrating carbon originating from the cytosol in the chloroplast stroma of mesophyll cells without altering leaf or cell anatomy. Photosynthetic efficiency would then strongly depend on the chloroplast envelope permeability to CO2. We examine the performance of this C4 cycle with a spatial model of carbon assimilation in C3 mesophyll cell geometry, conducting a thorough exploration of parameter space relevant to C4 photosynthesis. For envelope perme- abilities below 300 {micro}m/s C4 photosynthesis has a higher quantum efficiency than C3. However, even when envelope permeability is above this threshold, the C4 pathway can provide a substantial boost to carbon assimilation with only a moderate decrease in efficiency. Depending on the available light-harvesting capacity of plastids, C4 photosynthesis could boost carbon assimilation anywhere from 20% to 100%. Gains are even more prominent under CO2 deprivation, and can be achieved in conjunction with lower investment in plastids if chloroplast surface coverage is also altered. A C4 pathway operating within individual mesophyll cells of C3 plants could hence lead to higher growth rates and better drought resistance in dry, high-sunlight climates.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal polarity relies on the selective localization of cargo to axons or dendrites. The molecular motor kinesin-1 moves cargo into axons but is also active in dendrites. This raises the question of how kinesin-1 activity is regulated to maintain the compartment-specific localization of cargo. Our in vivo structure-function analysis of endogenous Drosophila kinesin-1 reveals a novel role for autoinhibition in enabling the dendrite-specific localization of Golgi outposts. Mutations that disrupt kinesin-1 autoinhibition result in the axonal mislocalization of Golgi outposts. Autoinhibition also regulates kinesin-1 localization. Uninhibited kinesin-1 accumulates in axons and is depleted from dendrites, correlating with the change in outpost distribution and dendrite growth defects. Genetic interaction tests show that a balance of kinesin-1 inhibition and dynein activity is necessary to localize Golgi outposts to dendrites and keep them from entering axons. Our data indicate that kinesin-1 activity is precisely regulated by autoinhibition to achieve the selective localization of dendritic cargo.\\n\\nSummaryNeuronal polarity relies on the axon-or dendrite-specific localization of cargo by molecular motors such as kinesin-1.

    "abstract": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles around 30-100 nm in diameter that are secreted from cells and can be found in most body fluids. Exosomes can be a vital source of biomarkers as they contain various substances (e.g. lipids, RNAs, metabolites and proteins) that can reflect the cell of origin (e.g. cancer cells). For isolation of exosomes present in biological matrices, ultracentrifugation (UC)-based procedures are most common. Other approaches exist, including commercial kits developed for easy and low sample volume isolation. In this study, differential UC and an isolation kit from a major vendor (Total Exosome Isolation Reagent from Thermo Fisher Scientific) were compared. Exosomes were isolated from cell culture media of two different cell sources (patient derived cells from glioblastoma multiforme and the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231). For both isolation methods, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and western blotting indicated the presence of exosomes. The kit- and UC isolates contained similar amounts of protein measured by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay with absorbance at 562 nm. Using western blot, positive exosome markers were identified in all isolates, and additional exosome markers were identified using MS-based proteomics. For the glioblastoma exosome isolates, the number of proteins identified with liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) was higher for the UC isolates than the kit isolates when injecting equal protein amounts, contrary to that for the breast cancer exosome isolates. However, negative exosome markers were also found in glioblastoma isolates using LC-MS/MS. Thus, we would not use the term \\\"exosome isolation\\\" as impurities may be present with both isolation methods. Notably, potential biomarkers for both diseases were identified in the isolates using LS-MS/MS. In our opinion, the two isolation methods had rather similar performance, although with some minor differences based on cell of origin.",

However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, in part because of a lack of methods to modulate collagen fibril topology in the presence of embedded cells. In this work, we develop a technique to tune the fibril architecture of cell-laden 3D collagen matrices using PEG as an inert molecular crowding agent. With this approach, we demonstrate that fibril length and pore size can be modulated independently of bulk collagen density and stiffness. Using live cell imaging and quantitative analysis, we show that matrices with long fibrils induce cell elongation and single cell migration, while shorter fibrils induce cell rounding, collective migration, and morphogenesis. We conclude that fibril architecture is an independent regulator of cancer cell phenotype and that cell shape and invasion strategy are functions of collagen fibril length.",

    "abstract": "We present a method for high-throughput screening of protein variants where the signal is enhanced by micro-encapsulation of single cells into 20-30 m agarose beads. Cells inside beads are propagated using standard agitation in liquid media and grow clonally into micro-colonies harboring several hundred bacteria. We have, as a proof-of-concept, analyzed random amino acid substitutions in the five C-terminal {beta}-strands of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Starting from libraries of variants, each bead represents a clonal line of cells that can be separated by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Pools representing collections of individual variants with desired properties are subsequently analyzed by deep sequencing. Notably, the encapsulation approach described holds the potential for high-throughput analysis of systems where the fluorescence signal from a single cell is insufficient for detection. Fusion to GFP, or use of fluorogenic substrates, allows coupling protein levels or activity to sequence for a wide range of proteins. Here we analyzed more than 10,000 individual variants to gauge the effect of mutations on GFP-fluorescence. In the mutated region, we observed virtually all amino acid substitutions that are accessible by single nucleotide exchange. Lastly, we assessed the performance of biophysical protein stability predictors, FoldX and Rosetta, in predicting the outcome of the experiment. Both tools display good performance on average, suggesting that loss of thermodynamic stability is a key mechanism for the observed variation of the mutants. This, in turn, suggests that deep mutational scanning datasets may be used to more efficiently fine-tune such predictors, especially for mutations poorly covered by current biophysical data.",

However, most proteins function by interacting with other proteins or molecules, and many functional associations should be limited to specific regions rather than the entire protein length. Most domain-centric function prediction methods depend on accurate domain family assignments to infer relationships between domains and functions, with regions that are unassigned to a known domain-family left out of functional evaluation. Given the abundance of residue-level annotations currently available, we present a function prediction methodology that automatically infers function labels of specific protein regions using protein-level annotations and multiple types of region-specific features.\\n\\nResultsWe apply this method to local features obtained from InterPro, UniProtKB and amino acid sequences and show that this method improves both the accuracy and region-specificity of protein function transfer and prediction by testing on both human and yeast proteomes. We compare region-level predictive performance of our method against that of a whole-protein baseline method using a held-out dataset of proteins with structurally-verified binding sites and also compare protein-level temporal holdout predictive performances to expand the variety and specificity of GO terms we could evaluate.

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer to bone metastases are almost always lethal. This results from the ability of metastatic prostate cancer cells to co-opt bone remodeling leading to what is known as the vicious cycle. Understanding how tumor cells can disrupt bone homeostasis through their interactionswith the stroma and how metastatic tumors respond to treatment is key to the development of new treatments for what remains an incurable disease. Here we describe an evolutionary game theoretical model of both the homeostatic bone remodeling and its co-option by prostate cancer metastases. This model extends past the evolutionary aspects typically considered in game theoretical models by also including ecological factors such as the physical microenvironment of the bone. Our model recapitulates the current paradigm of the \\\"vicious cycle\\\" driving tumor growth and sheds light on the interactions of heterogeneous tumor cells with the bone microenvironment and treatment response. Our results show that resistant populations naturally become dominant in the metastases under conventional cytotoxic treatment and that novel schedules could be used to better control the tumor and the associated bone disease compared to the current standard of care. Specifically, we introduce fractionated follow up therapy - chemotherapy where dosage is administered initially in one solid block followed by alternating smaller doeses and holidays - and argue that it is better than either a continuous application or a periodic one. Furthermore, we also show that different regimens of chemotherapy can lead to different amounts of pathological bone that are known to correlate with poor quality of life for bone metastatic prostate cancer patients.",

Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase pathways, which transduce multiple extracellular cues, have been shown to be interconnected with the cell cycle. Using budding yeast as a model system, we have quantified in hundreds of live single cells the interplay between the MAPK regulating the mating response and the Cyclin-Dependent Kinase controlling cell cycle progression. Different patterns of MAPK activity dynamics could be identified by clustering cells based on their CDK activity, denoting the tight relationship between these two cellular signals.

It is highly expressed in murine and human phagocytes, and macrophages lacking Perforin-2 are compromised in their ability to kill phagocytosed bacteria. In this study we used Salmonella typhimurium as a model intracellular pathogen to elucidate the mechanism of Perforin-2 s bactericidal activity. In vitro Perforin-2 was found to facilitate the degradation of antigens contained within the envelope of phagocytosed bacteria. In contrast, degradation of a representative surface antigen was found to be independent of Perforin-2. Consistent with our in vitro results a protease sensitive, periplasmic superoxide disumutase (SodCII) contributed to the virulence of S. typhimurium in Perforin-2 knockout but not wild-type mice. In aggregate our studies indicate that Perforin-2 breaches the envelope of phagocytosed bacteria facilitating the delivery of proteases and other antimicrobial effectors to sites within the bacterial envelope.",

Species-specific polymorphisms in the influenza virus polymerase restrict its host range during transmission from birds to mammals. ANP32A was recently been identified as a cellular co-factor impacting polymerase adaption and activity. Avian influenza polymerases require ANP32A containing an insertion resulting from an exon duplication uniquely encoded in birds. Here we find that natural splice variants surrounding this exon create avian ANP32A proteins with distinct effects on polymerase activity. We demonstrate species-independent direct interactions between all ANP32A variants and the PB2 polymerase subunit. This interaction is enhanced in the presence of viral genomic RNA. In contrast, only avian ANP32A restored ribonucleoprotein complex assembly for a restricted polymerase by enhancing RNA synthesis. Our data suggest that ANP32A splicing variation amongst birds differentially impacts viral replication, polymerase adaption, and the potential of avian hosts to be reservoirs.",

We find that women authors have been persistently underrepresented in high-profile journals. This under-representation has persisted over more than a decade, with glacial improvement over time. Even within our limited group of high profile journals, the percent of female first and last authors is negatively associated with journal impact factor.

Sequencing-based approaches that average together many cells have suggested that polymerase binding and polymerase release from promoter-proximal pausing are two key regulated steps in the transcriptional process. However, single cell studies have revealed that transcription occurs in short, discontinuous bursts, suggesting that transcriptional burst initiation and termination might also be regulated steps. Here, we develop and apply a quantitative framework to connect changes in both Pol II ChIP-seq and single cell transcriptional measurements to changes in the rates of specific steps of transcription. Using a number of global and targeted transcriptional regulatory perturbations, we show that burst initiation rate is indeed a key regulated step, demonstrating that transcriptional activity can be frequency modulated. Polymerase pause release is a second key regulated step, but the rate of polymerase binding is not changed by any of the biological perturbations we examined. Our results establish an important role for transcriptional burst regulation in the control of gene expression.",

The social opportunity paradigm is a methodology in which dynamic shifts in social context are induced through removal of the alpha male in a dominance hierarchy, leading to rapid ascent in the hierarchy of the beta male and of other subordinate males in the social group. In the current study, we use the social opportunity paradigm to determine what brain regions respond to this dynamic change in social context, allowing an individual to recognize the absence of the alpha male and subsequently perform status-appropriate social behaviors. Replicating our previous work, we show that following removal of the alpha male, beta males rapidly ascend the social hierarchy and attain dominant status by increasing aggression towards more subordinate individuals. Analysis of patterns of Fos immunoreactivity throughout the brain indicates that in individuals undergoing social ascent, there is increased activity in regions of the social behavior network, as well as the infralimbic and prelimbic regions of the prefrontal cortex and areas of the hippocampus.

The model was then validated using an independent cohort of 9,700 SCLC patients diagnosed from 2012 to 2013. The prognostic performance was evaluated using p value, concordance index and integrated Area Under the (time dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve.\\n\\nResultsThe following variables were contained in the final prognostic model: age, gender, race, ethnicity, Charlson/Deyo Score, TNM Stage (assigned according to the AJCC 8th edition), treatment type (combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy), and laterality. The model was validated in an independent testing group with a concordance index of 0.722 {+/-} 0.004 and an integrated AUC of 0.79.

    "abstract": "Most high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSC) arise from Serous Tubal Intraepithelial Carcinoma (STIC) lesions in the distal end of the fallopian tube (FT). FT secretory cells become malignant by accumulating genomic aberrations over 6-7 years before seeding the ovarian surface, with rapid tumor dissemination to other abdominal structures thereafter. It remains unclear how nascent malignant cells leave the FT to colonize the ovary. This report provides evidence that the L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) contributes to the ability of transformed FT secretory cells (FTSEC) to detach from the tube, survive under anchorage-independent conditions, and seed the ovarian surface. L1CAM was highly expressed on the apical surface of STIC lesions and contributed to ovarian colonization by upregulating integrin and fibronectin in malignant cells and activating the AKT and ERK pathways. These changes increased cell survival under ultra-low attachment conditions that mimic transit from the FT to the ovary. To study metastasis to the ovary, we developed a tumor-ovary co-culture model. We showed that L1CAM expression was important for FT cells to invade the ovary as a cohesive group. Our results indicate that in the early stages of HGSC development, transformed FTSECs disseminate from the FT to the ovary in L1CAM-dependent manner.\\n\\nThe authors have declared that no conflict of interest exists\\n\\nList of abbreviations",

    "abstract": "The search for general properties in network structure has been a central issue for food web studies in recent years. One such property is the small-world topology that combines a high clustering and a small distance between nodes of the network. This property may increase food web resilience but make them more sensitive to the extinction of connected species. Food web theory has been developed principally from freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, largely omitting marine habitats. If theory needs to be modified to accommodate observations from marine ecosystems, based on major differences in several topological characteristics is still on debate. Here we investigated if the small-world topology is a common structural pattern in marine food webs. We developed a novel, simple and statistically rigorous method to examine the largest set of complex marine food webs to date. More than half of the analyzed marine networks exhibited a similar or lower characteristic path length than the random expectation, whereas 39% of the webs presented a significantly higher clustering than its random counterpart. Our method proved that 5 out of 28 networks fulfilled both features of the small-world topology: short path length and high clustering. This work represents the first rigorous analysis of the small-world topology and its associated features in high-quality marine networks. We conclude that such topology is a structural pattern that is not maximized in marine food webs; thus it is probably not an effective model to study robustness, stability and feasibility of marine ecosystems.",

The mechanisms of polyploid success in ecologically relevant contexts, however, remain largely unknown. Here we conducted an extensive test of functional trait divergence and trait plasticity in conferring polyploid fitness advantage in changing environments by growing clonal replicates of a worldwide genotype collection of six polyploid and five diploid wild strawberry (Fragaria) species in three climatically different common gardens. Among leaf functional traits, we detected divergence in means but not plasticities between polyploids and diploids, suggesting that increased genomic redundancy does not necessarily translate into broader phenotypic amplitude in polyploids. Across the heterogeneous garden environments, however, polyploids exhibited fitness advantage, which was conferred by both trait means and adaptive trait plasticities, supporting a  jack-and-master hypothesis for polyploids. Our findings provide unparalleled insight into the prevalence and persistence of polyploidization.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) stand as powerful experimental designs for identifying DNA variants associated with complex traits and diseases. In the past decade, both the number of such studies and their sample sizes have increased dramatically. Recent GWAS of height and body mass index (BMI) in [~]250,000 European participants have led to the discovery of [~]700 and [~]100 nearly independent SNPs associated with these traits, respectively. Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in [~]450,000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined GWAS meta-analysis reaches N[~]700,000 individuals and substantially increases the number of GWAS signals associated with these traits. We identified 3,290 and 716 near-independent SNPs associated with height and BMI, respectively (at a revised genome-wide significance threshold of p<1 x 10-8), including 1,185 height-associated SNPs and 554 BMI-associated SNPs located within loci not previously identified by these two GWAS. The genome-wide significant SNPs explain [~]24.6% of the variance of height and [~]5% of the variance of BMI in an independent sample from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Correlations between polygenic scores based upon these SNPs with actual height and BMI in HRS participants were 0.44 and 0.20, respectively. From analyses of integrating GWAS and eQTL data by Summary-data based Mendelian Randomization (SMR), we identified an enrichment of eQTLs amongst lead height and BMI signals, prioritisting 684 and 134 genes, respectively. Our study demonstrates that, as previously predicted, increasing GWAS sample sizes continues to deliver, by discovery of new loci, increasing prediction accuracy and providing additional data to achieve deeper insight into complex trait biology.

    "abstract": "Orthologs of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) UL16 gene are conserved throughout the Herpesviridae. Because of this conservation, one might expect that these proteins perform similar functions for all herpesviruses. Previous studies on a UL16 null mutant derived from HSV-2 strain 186 revealed a roughly 100-fold replication defect and a critical role for UL16 in the nuclear egress of capsids. These findings were in stark contrast to what has been observed with UL16 mutants of HSV-1 and pseudorabies virus where roughly 10-fold replication deficiencies were reported that were accompanied by defects in the secondary envelopment of cytoplasmic capsids. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the HSV-2 186 strain is not representative of the HSV-2 species. To address this possibility, multiple UL16 null mutants were constructed in multiple HSV-2 and HSV-1 strains by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis and their phenotypes characterized side-by-side. This analysis showed that all the HSV-2 UL16 mutants had 50 to 100-fold replication deficiencies that were accompanied by defects in the nuclear egress of capsids as well as defects in the secondary envelopment of cytoplasmic capsids. By contrast, most HSV-1 UL16 mutants had 10-fold replication deficiencies that were accompanied by defects in secondary envelopment of cytoplasmic capsids. These findings indicated that UL16 has HSV species-specific functions. Interestingly, HSV-1 UL16 could promote the nuclear egress of HSV-2 UL16 null strains, suggesting that, unlike HSV-1, HSV-2 lacks an activity that can compensate for nuclear egress in the absence of UL16.\\n\\nImportanceHSV-2 and HSV-1 are important human pathogens that cause distinct diseases in their hosts. A complete understanding of the morphogenesis of these viruses is expected to reveal vulnerabilities that can be exploited in the treatment of HSV disease. UL16 is a virion structural component that is conserved throughout the Herpesviridae and functions in virus morphogenesis, however, previous studies have suggested different roles for UL16 in the morphogenesis of HSV-2 and HSV-1. This study sought to resolve this apparent discrepancy by analyzing multiple UL16 mutant viruses derived from multiple strains of HSV-2 and HSV-1. The data indicate that UL16 has HSV species-specific functions insofar as HSV-2 has a requirement for UL16 in the escape of capsids from the nucleus whereas both HSV-2 and HSV-1 require UL16 for final envelopment of capsids at cytoplasmic membranes.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial agent with a high propensity for developing resistance to antibiotics. This ability relies on horizontal gene transfer mechanisms occurring in the Acinetobacter genus, including natural transformation. To study natural transformation in bacteria, the most prevalent method uses selection for the acquisition of an antibiotic resistance marker in a target chromosomal locus by the recipient cell. Most clinical isolates of A. baumannii are resistant to multiple antibiotics limiting the use of such selection-based method. Here we report the development of a phenotypic and selection-free method based on flow cytometry to detect transformation events in multidrug resistant (MDR) clinical A. baumannii isolates. To this end, we engineered a translational fusion between the abundant and conserved A. baumannii nucleoprotein (HU) and the superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP). The new method was benchmarked against the conventional antibiotic selection-based method. Using this new method, we investigated several parameters affecting transformation efficiencies and identified conditions of transformability one hundred times higher than those previously reported. Using optimized transformation conditions, we probed natural transformation in a set of MDR clinical and non-clinical animal A. baumannii isolates. Regardless of their origin, the majority of the isolates displayed natural transformability, indicative of a conserved trait in the species. Overall, this new method and optimized protocol will greatly facilitate the study of natural transformation in the opportunistic pathogen A. baumannii.",

The visual stimulus was paired with optogenetic stimulation to assess how enhancing V1 inhibitory neuron activity synchronously during cortical responses altered task performance. PV or SST activation impaired, while VIP stimulation improved, contrast increment detection. Notably, PV or SST stimulation also impaired contrast decrement detection, when opsin-evoked inhibition would exaggerate stimulus-evoked decrements in firing rate, and thus might improve performance. The impairment produced by PV or SST stimulation persisted throughout many weeks of testing. In contrast mice learned to reliably detect VIP activation in the absence of natural visual stimulation. Thus, different inhibitory signals make distinct contributions to visual contrast perception.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory habituation results from prolonged exposure to an odor, leading to perceptual changes defined by several characteristics. To date, human habituation research has focused on orthonasal olfaction which is perceived externally while ignoring internal routes of odor perception related to flavor. In our study, we conducted two experiments to characterize retronasal olfactory habituation and measured its impact on flavor perception. In Experiment 1, 22 participants rhythmically breathed a food odor (lime), non-food odor (lavender), and blank (propylene glycol) that was presented using an orally-adhered strip, while rating the odor intensity using the time-intensity procedure. After a 10-minute exposure, the participants ate a lime-flavored gummy and rated the lime flavor. In Experiment 2, the same procedure was performed for a low-level lime odor, a simple (lime oil) and complex (lime oil + sucrose + citric acid) beverage as the flavor stimuli. Our results demonstrated two known principles of habituation for retronasally presented odors: 1) prolonged exposure lead to decreased perception, 2) weaker stimuli lead to more rapid habituation. Additionally, we found that the non-food odor habituated slower than the food odor; however, the participants seemed to recover simultaneously upon food and beverage consumption leading to no change in flavor perception.",

    "abstract": "As a crucial mechanism to enforce social norms, people as third parties tend to punish the norm violators even it costs their own pay-off. However, people do not usually treat everyone equally, e.g., it is shown that people are nice to close others. Here, we investigated how third party punishment (TPP) and its neural correlates is modulated by social distance (SD) by using fMRI. Behaviorally, participants punished more when the unfair perpetrator was more distant to them. Such SD-modulation effect was stronger when the punishment was free. Model-based results showed that SD-dependent computational signals were encoded in right dlPFC. More interestingly, SD modulated the relationship between punishment levels and neural activities in default network including vmPFC and bilateral hippocampus. The explorative functional connectivity analysis further showed that the vmPFC increased the association with left dlPFC when participants punished close others. Finally, punishment type (costly vs. free) also modulated the relationship between punishment levels and neural correlates in dACC and the ventral striatum. Taken together, our results revealed the neurocomputational underpinnings of how SD plays an important role in affecting TPP.",

Plant secondary metabolites of botanical origin are tested here-in to study their effect in Meloidogyne incognita locomotion, being this an important factor affecting host inoculation inside the soil. We compare the effect to the respective behavioral responses of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. The tested botanical nematicidals, all reported of activity against Meloidogyne sp. in our previous works, belong to different chemical groups of small molecular weight molecules encompassing acids, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones. Specifically we report on the attractant or repellent properties of trans-anethole, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, (E)-2-decenal, fostiazate, and 2-undecanone. The treatments for both nematode species were made at sublethal concentration levels, namely 1mM (<EC50), and the chemical control used for the experiment was the commercial nematicide fosthiazate and oxamyl. According to our results, trans-anethole, decenal, and oxamyl act as C. elegans attractants. 2-undecanone strongly attracts M. incognita. These findings can be of use in the development of nematicidal formulates, contributing to the disruption of nematode chemotaxis to root systems.",

However, it remains to be proved to what extent these interindividual differences in stress responses may be attributed to the statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean (RTM). We sought to test the hypothesis that the statistical artifact RTM explains part of the baseline effect.\\n\\nApproachHeart rate recording was carried out in 1,156 volunteers. To obtain an estimate of the stress response, 148 persons were randomly selected. Participants were monitored on a rest day and just before an academic examination for state anxiety and HRV. Participants were divided into quartiles according to baseline HRV levels and were compared for response to academic stress.\\n\\nMain resultsWe observed a significant reduction in HRV in subjects with a high baseline HRV (> 75th percentile), while a significant increase was found in the group with low baseline HRV. Regression analysis demonstrated that the value of baseline HRV correlated with the magnitude of stress reaction consistent with the RTM model. Baseline-adjusted ANCOVA does not reveal significant intergroup differences in the changes in heart rate (HR) and HRV from rest to exam. RTM-adjusted estimates confirmed an exam effect for HR and HRV.\\n\\nSignificanceThe results of our study strongly support RTM as the source of variability of stress-related changes in HRV.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue (BAT) share a common lineage and have been functionally linked, as exercise increases browning through the actions of various myokines. It is unknown, however, whether BAT can affect skeletal muscle function. Our prior work has shown that loss of the transcription factor IRF4 in BAT (BATI4KO) reduces adaptive thermogenesis. Here, we note that these mice also have reduced exercise capacity relative to wild-type littermates, associated with diminished mitochondrial function, ribosomal protein synthesis, and mTOR signaling in muscle, in addition to the signature ultrastructural abnormalities of tubular aggregate myopathy. Within brown adipose tissue, loss of IRF4 caused the induction of a myogenic gene expression signature, which includes an increase in the secreted factor myostatin, a known inhibitor of muscle function. Reduction of myostatin activity by the injection of neutralizing antibodies or soluble ActRIIB receptor rescued the exercise capacity of BATI4KO mice. Additionally, overexpression of IRF4 in brown adipocytes reduced serum myostatin and increased mitochondrial function and exercise capacity in muscle. A physiological role for this system is suggested by the observation that mice housed at thermoneutrality show lower exercise capacity with increased serum myostatin; both of these abnormalities are corrected by surgical removal of BAT. Collectively, our data point to an unsuspected level of BAT-muscle cross-talk driven by IRF4 and myostatin.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIMice lacking IRF4 in BAT have a decrease in exercise capacity, accompanied by histological, ultrastructural, signaling, gene expression, and bioenergetic evidence of myopathy in white vastus.\\nC_LIO_LILoss of IRF4 promotes the expression of a myogenic signature in BAT, including the myokine myostatin.\\nC_LIO_LINeutralization of serum myostatin rescues the ability of BATI4KO mice to exercise normally, while overexpression of IRF4 in BAT allows mice to run better than wild-type counterparts.\\nC_LIO_LIThermoneutrality reduces the level of IRF4 in BAT of WT mice, resulting in a myopathic phenotype that can be reversed by surgical excision of BAT.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveRoutine health records can be of great value in epidemiological and genetic studies if they are able to reliably identify true disease cases, especially when linked to large cohort studies. Little research has been undertaken into whether coding within UK electronic health records (EHR) is able to accurately identify clinical disease cases of common hand conditions. There is therefore a relative paucity of hand surgical research using EHRs due to concerns that cases cannot be accurately identified.\\n\\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of hospital and primary care coding of routine EHRs for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and base of thumb osteoarthritis (BTOA). Self-reported disease state as recorded in UK Biobank, a large prospective cohort study was also investigated.\\n\\nMethodsCode lists for each condition were generated by a team of clinicians, clinical coders and epidemiologists. All patients recruited to UK Biobank in one geographical region (Lothian, Scotland) where linked primary and secondary care coded datasets available were included. A decision- making algorithm was designed to define an administratively-confirmed or a clinically confirmed disease case. Patient electronic medical records (EMRs) were independently interrogated by two clinicians and inter-observer reliability calculated.\\n\\nResultsOf the 17,201 Biobank participants in NHS Lothian, 268 had at least one code for CTS and 82 for BTOA. For CTS, 159 cases were confirmed, 100 cases had insufficient information and 9 cases were refuted. Excluding missing data, the positive predictive value (PPV) for true clinical disease cases was 96% for incident disease (90% for prevalent disease; overall 94%).\\n\\nFor BTOA, 27 cases were confirmed, 46 cases had insufficient information, and 9 cases were refuted. Excluding missing data, PPV for incident disease was 81% (prevalent disease 56%, overall PPV 75%). Interrogation of the disease cases with insufficient information noted a large proportion arising from primary care and self-report coding systems.\\n\\nAnalyzing code combinations revealed that secondary care codes had the highest PPV for CTS and BTOA, emphasizing a more robust evaluation of PPV for patients requiring hospital based care. Overall, inter-observer reliability was good, with agreement in 90% of cases (Cohens kappa of 0.79) for clinical disease cases in CTS and agreement of 98%, (kappa 0.96) for BTOA.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have demonstrated that coding within UK Biobank is of sufficient quality to enable use of the resource for epidemiological and genetic research into common hand conditions, and that EMRs can be used for manual validation of UK health coding systems. Further work is needed to consider potential regional and interdisciplinary differences in coding practice, in strategies for dealing with missing data in EHRs, and to validate coding of common hand conditions in primary care.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring adolescence, prevalence of pain and health risk factors such as smoking, alcohol use, and poor mental health rise sharply. While these risk factors and mental health are accepted public health concerns, the same is not true for pain. The aim of this study was to describe the relationship between back pain and health risk factors in adolescents.\\n\\nMethodsCross-sectional data from the Healthy Schools Healthy Futures study, and the Australian Child Wellbeing Project was used. The mean age of participants was 14-15 years. Children were stratified according to the frequency they experienced back pain over the past 6 months. Within each strata, the proportion of children that reported drinking alcohol or smoking in the past month and the proportion that experienced feelings of anxiety or depression was reported. Test-for-trend analyses assessed whether increasing frequency of pain was associated with health risk factors.\\n\\nResultsData from approximately 2,500 and 3,900 children in the two studies was analysed. Larger proportions of children smoked or drank alcohol within each strata of increasing pain frequency. The trend with report of anxiety and depression was less clear, although there was a marked difference between the children that reported pain  rarely or never, and those that experienced back pain more frequently.\\n\\nConclusionTwo large, independent samples show Australian adolescents that experience back pain more frequently are also more likely to smoke, drink alcohol and report feelings of anxiety and depression. Pain appears to be part of the picture of general health risk in adolescents.\\n\\nWhat is already known on this subject?The prevalence of back pain rises steeply during the adolescent years, and is responsible for considerable personal impact in a substantial minority. During this time, indicators of adverse health risk such as smoking, alcohol use, anxiety and depression also increase in prevalence. Pain and lifestyle-related health risk factors can have ongoing consequences that stretch into adulthood.\\n\\nWhat this study adds?This study shows a close relationship between increasing pain frequency, and tendency to engage in health risk behaviours and experience indicators of poor mental health in adolescents. This study shows that pain may be an important consideration in understanding the general health, and health risk in adolescents.",

    "abstract": "The discovery that humans can produce potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to several different epitopes on the HIV-1 spike has reinvigorated efforts to develop an antibody based HIV-1 vaccine. Antibody cloning from single cells revealed that nearly all bNAbs show unusual features that could help explain why it has not been possible to elicit them by traditional vaccination, and instead that it would require a sequence of different immunogens. This idea is supported by experiments with genetically modified immunoglobulin knock-in mice. Sequential immunization with a series of specifically designed immunogens was required to shepherd the development of bNAbs. However, knock-in mice contain super-physiologic numbers of bNAb precursor expressing B cells and therefore how these results can be translated to a more physiologic setting remains to be determined. Here we make use of adoptive transfer experiments using knock-in B cells that carry a synthetic intermediate in the pathway to anti-HIV-1 bNAb development to examine how the relationship between B cell receptor affinity and precursor frequency affects germinal center B cell recrutiment and clonal expansion. Immunization with soluble HIV-1 antigens can recruit bNAb precursor B cells to the germinal center when there are as few as 10 such cells per mouse. However, at low precursor frequencies the extent of clonal expansion is directly proportional to the affinity of the antigen for the B cell receptor, and recruitment to germinal centers is variable and dependent on re-circulation.\\n\\nSignificance statementAn essential requirement for an HIV-vaccine is to elicit antibodies to conserved regions of the spike protein (Env) becasue these antibodies can protect against infection. Although broadly neutralizing antibodies develop naturally in rare individuals after prolongued HIV infection, eliciting them by vaccination has only been possible in artificial knock-in mouse models wherein the number of B cells expressing the antibody precursor is super-physiologic. To understand the relationship between precursor frequency, antigen affinity and germinal center recruitment we have performed adoptive transfer experiments in which fixed numbers of precursor cells are engrafted in wild type mice. Our results provide a framework for understanding how precursor frequency and antigen affinity shape humoral immunity to HIV.",

We applied this approach to dissect the cell-type and spatial domain associated heterogeneity within the mouse visual cortex region. Our analysis identified distinct spatially associated signatures within glutamatergic and astrocyte cell compartments, indicating strong interactions between cells and their spatial environment.

Despite rapid advancements in CES analysis, the major challenge still resides in identifying the casual variants among the thousands of variants detected during CES testing, and thus establishing a molecular diagnosis. To improve the clinical exome diagnostic efficiency, we developed Phenoxome, a robust phenotype-driven model that adopts a network-based approach to facilitate automated variant prioritization and subsequent classification. Phenoxome dissects the phenotypic manifestation of a patient in conjunction with their genomic profile to filter and then prioritize putative pathogenic variants. To validate our method, we have compiled a clinical cohort of 105 positive patient samples (i.e. at least one reported  pathogenic variant) that represent a wide range of genetic heterogeneity from The Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. Our approach identifies the causative variants within the top 5, 10, or 25 candidates in more than 50%, 71%, or 88% of these patient samples respectively. Furthermore, we show that our method is optimized for clinical testing by yielding superior ranking of the pathogenic variants compared to current state-of-art methods.

    "abstract": "A major goal of population genetics has been to determine the extent to which selection at linked sites influences patterns of neutral nucleotide diversity in the genome. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that diversity is influenced by both positive and negative selection. For example, in many species there are troughs in diversity surrounding functional genomic elements, consistent with the action of either background selection (BGS) or selective sweeps. In this study, we investigated the causes of the diversity troughs that are observed in the wild house mouse genome. Using the unfolded site frequency spectrum (uSFS), we estimated the strength and frequencies of deleterious and advantageous mutations occurring in different functional elements in the genome. We then used these estimates to parameterize forward-in-time simulations of chromosomes, using realistic distributions of functional elements and recombination rate variation in order to determine if selection at linked sites can explain the observed patterns of nucleotide diversity. The simulations suggest that BGS alone cannot explain the dips in diversity around either exons or conserved non-coding elements (CNEs). A combination of BGS and selective sweeps, however, can explain the troughs in diversity around CNEs. This is not the case for protein-coding exons, where observed dips in diversity cannot be explained by parameter estimates obtained from the uSFS. We discuss the extent to which our results provide evidence of sweeps playing a role in shaping patterns of nucleotide diversity and the limitations of using the uSFS for obtaining inferences of the frequency and effects of advantageous mutations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe present a study examining the causes of variation in nucleotide diversity across the mouse genome. The status of mice as a model organism in the life sciences makes them an excellent model system for studying molecular evolution in mammals. In our study, we analyse how natural selection acting on new mutations can affect levels of nucleotide diversity through the processes of background selection and selective sweeps. To perform our analyses, we first estimated the rate and strengths of selected mutations from a sample of wild mice and then use our estimates in realistic population genetic simulations. Analysing simulations, we find that both harmful and beneficial mutations are required to explain patterns of nucleotide diversity in regions of the genome close to gene regulatory elements. For protein-coding genes, however, our approach is not able to fully explain observed patterns and we think that this is because there are strongly advantageous mutations that occur in protein-coding genes that we were not able to detect.",

    "abstract": "Despite the extreme diversity of T cell repertoires, many identical T cell receptor (TCR) sequences are found in a large number of individual mice and humans. These widely-shared sequences, often referred to as  public , have been suggested to be over-represented due to their potential immune functionality or their ease of generation by V(D)J recombination. Here we show that even for large cohorts the observed degree of sharing of TCR sequences between individuals is well predicted by a model accounting for the known quantitative statistical biases in the generation process, together with a simple model of thymic selection. Whether a sequence is shared by many individuals is predicted to depend on the number of queried individuals and the sampling depth, as well as on the sequence itself, in agreement with the data. We introduce the degree of publicness conditional on the queried cohort size and the size of the sampled repertoires. Based on these observations we propose a public/private sequence classifier,  PUBLIC (Public Universal Binary Likelihood Inference Classifier), based on the generation probability, which performs very well even for small cohort sizes.",

While probiotic or prebiotic approaches typically lead to a transient pulse in an organisms abundance, persistent establishment of an introduced species may require alternative strategies. Here, we introduce the concept of orthogonal niche engineering in the gut, where we include a resource typically absent from the diet, seaweed, to establish a customized niche for an introduced organism. We show that in the short term, co-introduction of this resource at 1% in the diet along with an organism with exclusive access to this resource, B. plebeius DSM 17135, enables it to colonize at a median abundance of 1%, frequently increasing in abundance to 10 or more percent. We construct a mathematical model of the system to infer that B. plebeius competitively acquires endogenous resources. We provide evidence that it competes with native commensals to achieve its observed abundance. We observe a diet-dependent loss in seaweed responsiveness of B. plebeius in the long term and show the potential for IgA-mediated control of putative invaders by the immune system. These results point to the potential for diet-based intervention as a means to introduce target organisms, but also indicate potential modes for failure of this strategy in the long term.",

However, whether hippocampal spatial coding resolution can be dynamically controlled within and between environments is unknown. In this work we recorded the firing of hippocampal principal cells in mice navigating virtual reality environments, which differed by the presence of local visual cues (virtual 3D objects). Objects improved spatial coding resolution globally with a higher proportion of place cells, smaller place fields, increased spatial selectivity and stability. Spatial coding resolution was notably enhanced locally near objects and could be rapidly tuned by their manipulations. In the presence of objects, place cells also displayed improved theta phase precession and theta timescale spike coordination. These results suggest that local visual cues can rapidly tune the resolution of the hippocampal mapping system within and between environments.",

    "abstract": "Twenty-nine protein kinase inhibitors have been used to treat human diseases. Out of these, two are Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) 1 and 2 inhibitors. ROCKs are attractive drug targets for a range of neurologic disorders; however a critical barrier to ROCK-based therapeutics is ambiguity over whether there are isoform-specific roles for ROCKs in neuronal structural plasticity. Here, we used a genetics approach to address this long-standing question. Both male and female adult ROCK1+/- and ROCK2+/- mice exhibited anxiety-like behaviors compared to littermate controls. Individual pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were targeted for iontophoretic microinjection of fluorescent dye, followed by high-resolution confocal microscopy and neuronal 3D reconstructions for morphometry analysis. Increased apical and basolateral dendritic length and intersections were observed in ROCK1+/- but not ROCK2+/- mice. Although dendritic spine densities were comparable among genotypes, apical spine extent was decreased in ROCK1+/- but increased in ROCK2+/- mice. Spine head and neck diameter were reduced similarly in ROCK1+/- and ROCK2+/- mice; however certain spine morphologic subclasses were more affected than others in a genotype-dependent manner. Biochemical analyses of ROCK substrates revealed that phosphorylation of LIM kinase was reduced in synaptic fractions from ROCK1+/- or ROCK2+/- mice, correlating to overlapping spine morphology phenotypes. Collectively, these observations implicate ROCK1 as a novel regulatory factor of neuronal dendritic structure and detail distinct and complementary roles of ROCKs in mPFC dendritic spine structural plasticity. This study provides a fundamental basis for current and future development of isoform-selective ROCK inhibitors to treat neurologic disorders.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCK) 1 and 2 heavily influence neuronal architecture and synaptic plasticity. ROCKs are exciting drug targets and pan-ROCK inhibitors are clinically approved to treat hypertension, heart failure, glaucoma, spinal cord injury, and stroke. However development of isoform-specific ROCK inhibitors is hampered due to ambiguity over ROCK1- or ROCK2-specific functions in the brain. Our study begins to address this critical barrier and demonstrates that ROCK1 can mediate the dendritic arbor of neurons while both ROCK1 and ROCK2 heavily influence dendritic spine morphology. This study highlights distinct and complementary roles for ROCK1 and ROCK1 in prefrontal cortex structural plasticity and provides a fundamental basis for future development of isoform-selective ROCK inhibitors to treat neurologic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Geometry and growth and division direction of individual cells are major contributors to plant organ shape and these processes are dependent on dynamics of microtubules (MT). Different MT structures, like the cortical microtubules, preprophase band and mitotic spindle, are characterized by diverse architectural dynamics (Hashimoto, 2015). While several MT binding proteins have been identified that have various effects on MT stability and architecture, they do not discriminate between the different MT structures. It is therefore likely that specific MT binding proteins exist that differentiate between MT structures in order to allow for the differences in architectural dynamics. Although evidence for the effect of specific cues, such as light and auxin, on MT dynamics has been shown in recent years (Lindeboom et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014), it remains unknown how such cues are integrated and lead to specific effects. Here we provide evidence for how auxin and calcium signaling can be integrated to modulate MT dynamics, by means of IQD proteins. We show that the Arabidopsis IQD15-18 subclade of this family is regulated by auxin signaling, can bind calmodulins in a calcium-dependent manner and are evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, AtIQD15-18 directly bind SPIRAL2 protein in vitro and in vivo and modulate its function, likely in a calmodulin-dependent way, thereby providing a missing link between two important regulatory pathways of MT dynamics.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryIQD proteins integrate auxin and calcium signaling, two major signaling pathways, to control the cytoskeleton dynamics and cell shape of Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "Cortical microtubule (MT) arrays play a critical role in plant cell shape determination by defining the direction of cell expansion1-3. The control of plant organ shape and architecture is a major target of cereal crop improvement. Given the pleiotropic effects of MT modification, however, it is challenging to exploiting MT array organization for crop improvement. Moreover, as plants continuously adapt cell growth and expansion to ever-changing environmental conditions, multiple environmental (e.g. light4) and developmental (e.g. hormones5,6) inputs need to be translated into changes of the MT cytoskeleton. Here, we identify and functionally characterize an auxin-inducible and MT-localized protein OsIQ67-DOMAIN14 (OsIQD14), which is highly expressed in rice seed hull cells. While deficiency of OsIQD14 results in short and wide seeds and increases overall yield, overexpression leads to narrow and long seeds, caused by changes in the direction of MT arrangement. We further show that OsIQD14-mediated MT reordering is regulated through interacting with SPIRAL2, a MT-binding protein involved in KATANIN1-mediated MT rearrangement7,8, and with calmodulin proteins. As such, OsIQD14 acts as an integrator of auxin and calcium inputs into MT rearrangements, and allows effective local cell shape manipulation to improve a key rice yield trait.",

    "abstract": "As biological function emerges through interactions between a cells molecular constituents, understanding cellular mechanisms requires us to catalogue all physical interactions between proteins [1-4]. Despite spectacular advances in high-throughput mapping, the number of missing human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) continues to exceed the experimentally documented interactions [5, 6]. Computational tools that exploit structural, sequence or network topology information are increasingly used to fill in the gap, using the patterns of the already known interactome to predict undetected, yet biologically relevant interactions [7-9]. Such network-based link prediction tools rely on the Triadic Closure Principle (TCP) [10-12], stating that two proteins likely interact if they share multiple interaction partners. TCP is rooted in social network analysis, namely the observation that the more common friends two individuals have, the more likely that they know each other [13, 14]. Here, we offer direct empirical evidence across multiple datasets and organisms that, despite its dominant use in biological link prediction, TCP is not valid for most protein pairs. We show that this failure is fundamental - TCP violates both structural constraints and evolutionary processes. This understanding allows us to propose a link prediction principle, consistent with both structural and evo-lutionary arguments, that predicts yet uncovered protein interactions based on paths of length three (L3). A systematic computational cross-validation shows that the L3 principle significantly outperforms existing link prediction methods. To experimentally test the L3 predictions, we perform both large-scale high-throughput and pairwise tests, finding that the predicted links test positively at the same rate as previously known interactions, suggesting that most (if not all) predicted interactions are real. Combining L3 predictions with experimen-tal tests provided new interaction partners of FAM161A, a protein linked to retinitis pigmentosa, offering novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that lead to the disease. Because L3 is rooted in a fundamental biological principle, we expect it to have a broad applicability, enabling us to better understand the emergence of biological function under both healthy and pathological conditions.\\n\\nSummaryWe unveil a fundamental organizing principle of biological networks and demonstrate its predictive power for uncovering novel protein interactions.",

Functional connectivity between motor neuron endplates and muscle fibers is confirmed with calcium transient imaging and electrophysiological recordings.

One major challenge has stemmed from difficulties in merging evidence from extant and extinct organisms. While these efforts have resulted in varying stages of synthesis, they have been hindered by their dependence on qualitative descriptions of morphology. Though rarely applied to phylogenetic inference, traditional and geometric morphometric data can improve these issues by generating more rigorous ways to quantify variation in morphological structures. They may also facilitate the rapid and objective aggregation of large morphological datasets. I describe a new Bayesian method that leverages quantitative trait data to reconstruct the positions of fossil taxa on fixed reference trees composed of extant taxa. Unlike most formulations of phylogenetic Brownian motion models, this method expresses branch lengths in units of morphological disparity, suggesting a new framework through which to construct Bayesian node calibration priors for molecular dating and explore comparative patterns in morphological disparity. I am hopeful that the approach described here will help to facilitate a deeper integration of neo- and paleontological data to move morphological phylogenetics further into the genomic era.",
