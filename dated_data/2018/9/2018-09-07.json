    "abstract": "Dens are crucial for the survival of all canids, however, for a meso-carnivore like red fox, denning is of greater importance as they utilize dens all throughout the year for protection, resting and breeding. The red fox known for its generalist and opportunistic behavior and extremely good adaptability to the dynamic anthropogenic changes is the most widespread and successful wild land carnivore. With an ever-growing human population the choice of space for wild animals is limited and such adaptability is important for species survival. In this study we examined the denning preferences and den characteristics of red fox. Intensive surveys were conducted across two study sites Chiktan and Changthang. Foxes preferred to den on mountain slopes (43.70 {+/-} 3.38 SE) where human disturbances were minimal. The red fox chose den sites closer to human settlements, water and road as compared to random points (Pillais trace = .487, F= 31.014 and P = 3.497e-14), which are risky and may expose the pups to humans but also provide the advantage of procuring anthropogenic food subsidies. In Changthang, foxes preferred to den at a greater distance (936 {+/-} 223 meters) from human settlements as compared to Chiktan (403 {+/-} 50 meters). The present research is of broad significance, given the increasing presence of human settlements within original animal ranges, even in remote harsh environments like the Trans-Himalaya.",

    "abstract": "Bioengineers have built increasingly sophisticated models of the tumor microenvironment in which to study cell-cell interactions, mechanisms of cancer growth and metastasis, and to test new potential therapies. These models allow researchers to culture cells in conditions that include features of the in vivo tumor microenvironment (TME) implicated in regulating cancer progression, such as ECM stiffness, integrin binding to the ECM, immune and stromal cells, growth factor and cytokine depots, and a 3D geometry more representative of the TME than tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). These biomaterials could be particularly useful for drug screening applications to make better predictions of efficacy, offering better translation to preclinical in vivo models and clinical trials. However, it can be challenging to compare drug response reports across different platforms and conditions in the current literature. This is, in part, as a result of inconsistent reporting and use of drug response metrics, and vast differences in cell growth rates across a large variety of biomaterial design. This perspective paper attempts to clarify the definitions of drug response measurements used in the field, and presents examples in which these measurements can and cannot be applied. We suggest as best practice to include appropriate controls, always measure the growth rate of cells in the absence of drug, and follow our provided \\\"decision tree\\\" matrix when reporting drug response metrics.",

    "abstract": "Fossils were long thought to lack original organic material, but the discovery of organic molecules in fossils and sub-fossils, thousands to millions of years old, has demonstrated the potential of fossil organics to provide radical new insights into the fossil record. How long different organics can persist remains unclear, however. Non-avian dinosaur bone has been hypothesised to preserve endogenous organics including collagen, osteocytes, and blood vessels, but proteins and labile lipids are unstable during diagenesis or over long periods of time. Furthermore, bone is porous and an open system, allowing microbial and organic flux. Some of these organics within fossil bone have therefore been identified as either contamination or microbial biofilm, rather than original organics. Here, we use biological and chemical analyses of Late Cretaceous dinosaur bones and sediment matrix to show that dinosaur bone hosts a diverse microbiome. Fossils and matrix were freshly-excavated, aseptically-acquired, and then analysed using microscopy, spectroscopy, chromatography, spectrometry, DNA extraction, and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The fossil organics differ from modern bone collagen chemically and structurally. A key finding is that 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing reveals that the subterranean fossil bones host a unique, living microbiome distinct from that of the surrounding sediment. Even in the subsurface, dinosaur bone is biologically active and behaves as an open system, attracting microbes that might alter original organics or complicate the identification of original organics. These results suggest caution regarding claims of dinosaur bone  soft tissue preservation and illustrate a potential role for microbial communities in post-burial taphonomy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe frog Xenopus laevis has notable regenerative capabilities, including that of the lens. The neural retina provides the factors that trigger lens regeneration from the cornea, but the identity of these factors is largely unknown. In contrast to the cornea, fibroblast growth factors FGF1, 8, and 9 are highly expressed within the retina, and are potential candidates for those factors. The purpose of this study is to determine whether specific FGF proteins can induce lens formation, and if perturbation of FGFR signaling inhibits lens regeneration.\\n\\nMethodsA novel cornea epithelial culture method was developed to investigate the sufficiency of FGFs in lens regeneration. Additionally, transgenic larvae expressing dominant negative FGFR1 were used to investigate the necessity of FGFR signaling in lens regeneration.\\n\\nResultsTreatment of cultured corneas with FGF1 induced lens regeneration in a dose-dependent manner, whereas treatment with FGF2, FGF8, or FGF9 did not result in significant lens regeneration. Inhibition of FGFR signaling decreased the lens regeneration rate for in vitro eye cultures.\\n\\nConclusionThe culture techniques developed here, and elsewhere, have provided reliable methods for examining the necessity of various factors that may be involved in lens regeneration. Based on the results demonstrated in this study, we found that FGF1 signaling and FGFR activation are key factors for lens regeneration in Xenopus.",

    "abstract": "Our results highlight for the first time that a significant proportion of cell doublets in flow cytometry, previously believed to be the result of technical artefacts and thus ignored in data acquisition and analysis, are the result of true biological interaction between immune cells. In particular, we show that cell:cell doublets pairing a T cell and a monocyte can be directly isolated from human blood, and high resolution microscopy shows polarized distribution of LFA1/ICAM1 in many doublets, suggesting in vivo formation. Intriguingly, T cell:monocyte complex frequency and phenotype fluctuate with the onset of immune perturbations such as infection or immunization, reflecting expected polarization of immune responses. Overall these data suggest that cell doublets reflecting T cell-monocyte in vivo immune interactions can be detected in human blood and that the common approach in flow cytometry to avoid studying cell:cell complexes should be revisited.",
