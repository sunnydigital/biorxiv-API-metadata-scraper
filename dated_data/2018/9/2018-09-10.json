    "abstract": "X-ray crystallography has been traditionally considered as the primary tool for the determination of biomolecular structures and its derived models are taken as the gold standard in structural biology. However, contacts formed through the crystal lattice are known to affect the structures, especially in the case of small and flexible molecules, like DNA oligos, introducing drastic changes in the structure with respect to the solution phase. Furthermore, it is still unknown why molecules crystallize in certain symmetry groups and how the associated lattice impacts their structure. The role of crystallization additives and whether they are just innocuous and unspecific catalyzers of the crystallization process also remains unclear. On account of a massive computational effort and the use of the latest generation force field, we were able to describe with unprecedented level of detail the nature of intermolecular forces that participate in the stabilization of B-DNA crystals in various symmetry groups and in different solvent environments. We showed that the stability of the crystal lattice and the type of crystallization additives are tightly coupled, and certain symmetry groups are only stable in the presence of a specific crystallization additive (i.e., spermine). Additives and crystal contacts induce small but non-negligible changes in the physical properties of DNA.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear envelope budding (NEB) is a recently discovered alternative pathway for nucleocytoplasmic communication distinct from the movement of material through the nuclear pore complex. Through quantitative electron microscopy and tomography, we demonstrate how NEB is evolutionarily conserved from early protists to human cells. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, NEB events occur with higher frequency during heat shock, upon exposure to arsenite or hydrogen peroxide, and when the proteasome is inhibited. Yeast cells treated with azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, a proline analogue that induces protein misfolding, display the most dramatic increase in NEB, suggesting a causal link to protein quality control. This link was further supported by both localization of ubiquitin and Hsp104 to protein aggregates and NEB events, and the evolution of these structures during heat shock. We hypothesize that NEB is part of normal cellular physiology in a vast range of species and that in S. cerevisiae NEB comprises a stress response aiding the transport of protein aggregates across the nuclear envelope.\n\nSignificance StatementA defining feature of eukaryotes is the nuclear envelope, a double lipid bilayer that serves to isolate and protect the cells genetic material. Transport of large molecules over this barrier is believed to occur almost exclusively via the nuclear pores. However, herpes virions and mega ribonucleoproteins (megaRNPs) use an alternative means of transport - via nuclear envelope budding (NEB). Here, we show NEB is a ubiquitous eukaryotic phenomenon and increases when exposed to various forms of cellular stress. NEB frequency was maximal when the cell was challenged with a drug that induces protein misfolding, indicating this transport pathway plays a role in protein quality control. These results imply that NEB is an underappreciated yet potentiallyfundamental means of nuclear transport.",

    "abstract": "Chemical-induced dimerisation (CID) uses small molecules to control specific protein-protein interactions. Here, we employ CID dependent on the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) to reconstitute spindle checkpoint signalling in fission yeast. The spindle checkpoint signal usually originates at unattached or inappropriately attached kinetochores. These are complex, multi-protein structures with several important functions. To bypass kinetochore complexity, we take a reductionist approach to study checkpoint signalling. We generate a synthetic checkpoint arrest ectopically by inducing hetero-dimerisation of the checkpoint proteins Mph1Mps1 and Spc7KNL1. These proteins are engineered such that they cant localise to kinetochores, and only form a complex in the presence of ABA. Using this novel assay we are able to checkpoint arrest a synchronous population of cells within 30 minutes of ABA addition. This assay allows for detailed genetic dissection of checkpoint activation and importantly it also provides a valuable tool for studying checkpoint silencing. To analyse silencing of the checkpoint and the ensuing mitotic exit, we simply wash-out the ABA from arrested cells. We show here that silencing is critically-dependent on PP1Dis2 recruitment to Mph1Mps1-Spc7KNL1 signalling platforms.",

    "abstract": "The Lineage 2-Beijing (L2-Beijing) sub-lineage of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has received much attention due to its high virulence, fast disease progression, and association with antibiotic resistance. Despite several reports of the recent emergence of L2-Beijing in Africa, no study has investigated the evolutionary history of this sub-lineage on the continent. In this study, we used whole genome sequences of 817 L2 clinical strains from 14 geographical regions globally distributed to investigate the origins and onward spread of this lineage in Africa. Our results reveal multiple introductions of L2-Beijing into Africa linked to independent bacterial populations from East-and Southeast Asia. Bayesian analyses further indicate that these introductions occurred during the past 300 years, with most of these events pre-dating the antibiotic era. Hence, the success of L2-Beijing in Africa is most likely due to its hypervirulence and high transmissibility rather than drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Cell fate specification in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is orchestrated via extrinsic and intrinsic molecular programs, and histone methylation in these decisions has been ascribed to a crucial function regulating gene expression. Here, we show that the COMPASS family histone methyltransferase co-factor ASH2L is required in NPCs proliferation and upper layer cortical projection neurons production and position. Deletion of Ash2l impairs trimethylation of H3K4 and transcriptional machinery specifically for subsets of Wnt-{beta}-catenin signalling, disrupting their transcription and consequently inhibiting the proliferation ability of NPCs in late stages of neurogenesis. Consistently, Ash2l conditional mutants exhibit thinning neocortex with reduced upper layer neurons and altered neuronal position. Moreover, overexpressing {beta}-catenin after Ash2l elimination or knockdown can rescue the proliferation deficiency of NPCs both in vivo and in vitro. These results demonstrate an essential and highly specific role for Ash2l in controlling NPCs proliferation and late-born neurons lamination in corticogenesis via transcriptionally regulating Wnt-{beta}-catenin signalling, and provide clues to how the COMPASS family epigenetic factors coordinate cell fate determination during cortex development.",

    "abstract": "The Clade A protein phosphatase 2C Highly ABA-Induced 1 (HAI1) plays an important role in stress signaling yet little information is available on HAI1-regulated phosphoproteins. Quantitative phosphoproteomics identified phosphopeptides of increased abundance in hai1-2 in unstressed plants and in plants exposed to low water potential (drought) stress. The identity and localization of the phosphoproteins as well as enrichment of specific phosphorylation motifs indicated that these phosphorylation sites may be regulated directly by HAI1 or by HAI1-regulated kinases including Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MPKs), Sucrose-non fermenting Related Kinase 2 (SnRK2s) or Casein Kinases. One of the phosphosites putatively regulated by HAI1 was S313/S314 of AT Hook-Like10 (AHL10), a DNA binding protein of unclear function. HAI1 could directly dephosphorylate AHL10 in vitro and the level of HAI1 expression affected the abundance of phosphorylated AHL10 in vivo. AHL10 S314 phosphorylation was critical for restriction of plant growth under low water potential stress and for regulation of Jasmonic Acid and Auxin-related gene expression as well as expression of developmental regulators including Shootmeristemless (STM). These genes were also mis-regulated in hai1-2. AHL10 S314 phosphorylation was required for AHL10 complexes to form foci within the nucleoplasm, suggesting that S314 phosphorylation may control AHL10 association with the nuclear matrix or with other transcriptional regulators. These data identify a set of HAI1-affected phosphorylation sites, show that HAI1-regulated phosphorylation of AHL10 S314 controls AHL10 function and localization and also indicate that HAI1-AHL10 signaling coordinates growth with stress and defense responses.",

However, the role of the common bacterial cohabitant, phage, in kin recognition, has not been explored. Here we find that a boundary (demarcation line) is formed between different swimming Escherichia coli strains but not between identical clones; hence, motile bacterial cells discriminate between self and non-self. The basis for this self-recognition is a novel, 49 kb, T1-type, lytic phage of the family siphoviridae (named here SW1) that controls formation of the demarcation line by utilizing one of the hosts cryptic prophage proteins, YfdM, to propagate. Critically, SW1 increases the fitness of E. coli K-12 compared to the identical strain that lacks the phage. Therefore, bacteria use phage to recognize kin.",

Using RNAseq of threespine stickleback fish gill tissue from four independent marine-freshwater ecotype pairs and their F1 hybrids, we show that cis-acting (allele-specific) regulation consistently predominates gene expression divergence. Genes showing parallel marine-freshwater expression divergence are found near to adaptive genomic regions, show signatures of natural selection around their transcription start sites and are enriched for cis-regulatory control. For genes with parallel increased expression among freshwater fish, the quantitative degree of cis- and trans-regulation is also highly correlated across populations, suggesting a shared genetic basis. Compared to other forms of regulation, cis-regulation tends to show greater additivity and stability across different genetic and environmental contexts, making it a fertile substrate for the early stages of adaptive evolution.",

    "abstract": "1DNA sequencing can discover not only single-base variants but also copy-number alterations (CNAs). In shotgun sequencing, regions of CNAs show step-wise changes in read depth when compared to adjacent \\\"normal\\\" regions, allowing their detection by parametric statistical tests that compare the mean coverage in suspected regions against that of a baseline distribution. Traditionally, the power of such a test depends on (1) the integer number of copy number change, (2) the overall sequencing depth, (3) the length of the CNA region, (4) the read length and (5) the variation of coverage along the genome, which depends on many experimental factors, including whether the chosen platform is whole-genome, whole-exome, or targeted-panel sequencing. In cases involving inadvertent sample mixing or genuine somatic mosaicism, power also depends on the mixing ratio. However, the analysis of statistical power that considers the interplay of all these factors has not been systematically developed. Here we present a general analytical framework and a series of simulations that explore situations from the simplest to the increasingly multifactorial. Specifically, we expand the expression of power to include not just the known factors but also one or both of two complications: (1) the dispersion of read depth around the mean beyond the independent sampling-by-sequencing assumption, and (2) the reduced fraction of the CNA-bearing sample (\\\"purity\\\") as seen in studies of intratumor heterogeneity or in clinical monitoring of minimal residual disease. We describe the analytical formula and their simplifications in special cases, and share the extendable scripts for others to perform customized power analysis using study-specific parameters. As study designs vary and technologies continue to evolve, the input data and the noise characteristics will change depending on the practical situation. We present two use cases commonly encountered in cancer research: ultra-shallow whole-genome sequencing for detecting large, chromosome-scale events, and targeted ultra-deep sequencing for surveillance of known CNAs in rare tumor clones in the task of sensitive detection of cancer relapse or metastasis.

Carnitines were significantly higher in liver, while lysophosphatidylcholines significantly lower in muscle and serum. An investigation of the progression to overt T2D showed that deoxycholic acid glycine conjugate was significantly higher in liver of pre-diabetes samples while additional increase in T2D was insignificant. A subset of lysophosphatidylcholines were significantly lower in the muscle of pre-diabetes subjects.

Here we visualize the dynamic cell morphologies of tangentially migrating SN-mDA neurons with 3D-time-lapse imaging and identify two distinct migration modes. Slow migration is the default mode in SN-mDA neurons, while fast, laterally-directed migration occurs infrequently and is strongly associated with bipolar cell morphology. By speci1cally inactivating Reelin signaling in mDA neurons we demonstrate its direct role in SN-mDA tangential migration. We show that Reelin signaling promotes laterally-biased movements in mDA neurons during their slow migration mode, stabilizes leading process morphology and increases the probability of fast, laterally-directed migration.",

Using single-molecule force spectroscopy, we found that the SM protein Munc18-1 catalyzes step-wise zippering of three synaptic SNAREs (syntaxin, VAMP2, and SNAP-25) into a four-helix bundle. Catalysis requires formation of an intermediate template complex in which Munc18-1 juxtaposes the N-terminal regions of the SNARE motifs of syntaxin and VAMP2, while keeping their C-terminal regions separated. Next, SNAP-25 binds the templated SNAREs to form a partially-zippered SNARE complex. Finally, full zippering displaces Munc18-1. Munc18-1 mutations modulate the stability of the template complex in a manner consistent with their effects on membrane fusion, indicating that chaperoned SNARE assembly is essential for exocytosis. Two other SM proteins, Munc18-3 and Vps33, similarly chaperone SNARE assembly via a template complex, suggesting that SM protein mechanism is conserved.",

    "abstract": "Most behaviors such as making tea are not stereotypical but have an obvious structure. However, analytical methods to objectively extract structure from non-stereotyped behaviors are immature. In this study, we analyze the locomotion of fruit flies and show that this non-stereotyped behavior is well-described by a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM). HHMM shows that a flys locomotion can be decomposed into a small number of locomotor features, and odors modulate locomotion by altering the time a fly spends performing different locomotor features. Importantly, although all flies in our dataset use the same set of locomotor features, individual flies vary considerably in how often they employ a given locomotor feature, and how this usage is modulated by odor. This variation is so large that the behavior of individual flies is best understood as being grouped into at least 3-5 distinct clusters, rather than variations around an average fly.",

    "abstract": "Sensitivity to different pain modalities has a genetic basis that remains largely unknown. Employing closely related inbred mouse substrains can facilitate gene mapping of nociceptive behaviors in preclinical pain models. We previously reported enhanced sensitivity to acute thermal nociception in C57BL/6J (B6J) versus C57BL/6N (B6N) substrains. Here, we expanded on nociceptive phenotypes and observed an increase in formalin-induced inflammatory nociceptive behaviors and paw diameter in B6J versus B6N mice (Charles River Laboratories). No strain differences were observed in mechanical or thermal hypersensitivity or in edema following the Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA) model of inflammatory pain, indicating specificity in the inflammatory nociceptive stimulus. In the chronic nerve constriction injury (CCI), a model of neuropathic pain, no strain differences were observed in baseline mechanical threshold or in mechanical hypersensitivity up to one month post-CCI. We replicated the enhanced thermal nociception in the 52.5{degrees}C hot plate test in B6J versus B6N mice from The Jackson Laboratory. Using a B6J x B6N-F2 cross (N=164), we mapped a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) underlying hot plate sensitivity to chromosome 7 that peaked at 26 Mb (LOD=3.81, p<0.01; 8.74 Mb-36.50 Mb) that was more pronounced in males. Genes containing expression QTLs (eQTLs) associated with the peak nociceptive marker that are implicated in pain and inflammation include Ryr1, Cyp2a5, Pou2f2, Clip3, Sirt2, Actn4, and Ltbp4 (FDR < 0.05). Future studies involving positional cloning and gene editing will determine the quantitative trait gene(s) and potential pleiotropy of this locus across pain modalities.",

    "abstract": "Coccidioides spp. are dimorphic, pathogenic fungi that can cause severe human and animal disease. Like the other primary fungal pathogens, animal infection results in a morphologic transformation from the environmental mycelial phase to a tissue phase, known as a spherule. The sequencing and annotation of Coccidioides spp. and the genomes of several nonpathogenic Onygenales species allows comparisons that provide clues about the Coccidioides spp. genes that might be involved in pathogenesis. The analysis in this study is a gene by gene orthology comparison. Although there were few differences in the size of genes families in the Coccidioides spp.-specific group compared to the genes shared by Coccidioides spp. and nonpathogenic Onygenales, there were a number of differences in the characterization of the two types of genes. Many more Coccidioides spp.-specific genes are up-regulated expression in spherules. Coccidioides spp.-specific genes more often lacked functional annotation and were more often classified as orphan genes. Analysis by random forest machine learning confirmed that high numbers of orthologs and high levels of expression in hyphae were predictive of common genes, while high levels of expression in spherules and more nonsynonymous predicted Coccidioides spp.-specific genes. Review of individual genes in the Coccidioides spp.-specific group identified a histidine kinase, two thioredoxin genes, a calmodulin gene and ureidoglycolate hydrolase. Hopefully, identification of these genes will be useful for pursuing potential Coccidioides spp. virulence genes in the future.",

Their combination of faster and slower-evolving regions and high copy number enables them to be used in many situations where other loci are unsuitable, with degraded samples and after recent speciation events.\\n\\nThe advent of next-generation sequencing technologies (and notably the Illumina platform) has led to an explosion in the number of samples that can be studied at transcriptomic level, at relatively low cost. Here we describe a robust pipeline for the recovery of mitochondrial genomes from these RNA-seq resources. This pipeline can be used on sequencing of a variety of depths, and reliably recovers the protein coding and ribosomal gene complements of mitochondria from almost any transcriptomic sequencing experiment. The complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome can also be recovered when sequencing is performed in sufficient depth. We evidence the efficacy of our pipeline using data from a number of non-model invertebrates of four disparate phyla, namely Porifera, Nemertea, Mollusca and Annelida. Interestingly, among our poriferan data, where microbiological symbionts are known empirically to make mitochondrial assembly difficult, this pipeline proved especially useful.\\n\\nOur pipeline will allow the recovery of mitochondrial data from a variety of previously-sequenced samples, and add an additional angle of enquiry to future RNA-seq efforts, simplifying the process of mitochondrial genome assembly for even the most recalcitrant clades and adding this data to the scientific record for a range of future uses.",

    "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by an interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Epigenetics is crucial to lasting changes in gene expression in the brain. Recent studies suggest a role for DNA methylation in ADHD. We explored the contribution to ADHD of allele-specific methylation (ASM), an epigenetic mechanism that involves SNPs correlating with differential levels of DNA methylation at CpG sites. We selected 3,896 tagSNPs reported to influence methylation in human brain regions and performed a case-control association study using the summary statistics from the largest GWAS meta-analysis of ADHD, comprising 20,183 cases and 35,191 controls. We identified associations with eight tagSNPs that were significant at a 5% False Discovery Rate (FDR). These SNPs correlated with methylation of CpG sites lying in the promoter regions of six genes. Since methylation may affect gene expression, we inspected these ASM SNPs together with 52 ASM SNPs in high LD with them for eQTLs in brain tissues and observed that the expression of three of those genes was affected by them. ADHD risk alleles correlated with increased expression (and decreased methylation) of ARTN and PIDD1 and with a decreased expression (and increased methylation) of C2orf82. Furthermore, these three genes were predicted to have altered expression in ADHD, and genetic variants in C2orf82 correlated with brain volumes. In summary, we followed a systematic approach to identify risk variants for ADHD that correlated with differential cis-methylation, identifying three novel genes contributing to the disorder.",

We developed a template-free image processing procedure for accurate tracing of complex networks of densities in cryo-electron tomograms, a comprehensive and automated detection of heterogeneous membrane-bound complexes and an unsupervised classification. Applying this procedure to tomograms of intact cells and isolated endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we detected and classified small protein complexes like the ER protein translocons, which were not detected by other methods before. This classification provided sufficiently homogeneous particle sets and initial references to allow subsequent de novo subtomogram averaging. Therefore the procedure presented allows a comprehensive detection and a structural analysis of complexes in their native state. In addition, we present structural evidence that different ribosome-free translocon species are present at the ER membrane, determine their 3D structure, and show that they have different localization patterns forming nanodomains.",

The later stages of cell division include the formation of the microtubule (MT)-rich central spindle in anaphase, which is required to properly define the cell equator, guide the assembly of the acto-myosin contractile ring, and ultimately ensure complete separation and isolation of the two daughter cells via abscission. Much is known about the molecular machinery that forms the central spindle, including proteins needed to generate the antiparallel overlapping interzonal MTs. One critical protein that has garnered great attention is Protein Regulator of Cytokinesis 1 (PRC1), or Fascetto (Feo) in Drosophila, which forms a homodimer to crosslink interzonal MTs, ensuring proper central spindle formation and cytokinesis. Here, we report on a new direct protein interactor and regulator of Feo we named Fascetto Interacting Protein (FIP). Loss of FIP results in a significant reduction in Feo localization, rapid disassembly of interzonal MTs, and several cytokinesis defects. Simultaneous reduction in Feo and FIP results in tumor-like, DNA-filled masses in the brain. In aggregate our data show that FIP functions upstream of, and acts directly on, Feo to ensure fully accurate cell division.",

Here, using a combination of live imaging, modeling, and microsurgical perturbations, we show that the axial and paraxial tissues in the forming avian embryonic body coordinate their rates of elongation through mechanical interactions. First, a cell motility gradient drives paraxial presomitic mesoderm (PSM) expansion, resulting in compression of the axial neural tube and notochord; second, elongation of axial tissues driven by PSM compression and polarized cell intercalation pushes the caudal progenitor domain posteriorly; finally, the axial push drives progenitors to emigrate into the PSM to maintain tissue growth and cell motility. These interactions form an engine-like positive feedback loop, which ensures the tissue-coupling and self-sustaining characteristics of body elongation. Our results suggest a general role of inter-tissue forces in the coordination of complex morphogenesis involving distinct tissues.",

The expression of foxc1b in early peri-endothelial mesenchymal cells allows us to follow the morphogenesis of mesenchyme into acta2 expressing vascular smooth muscle cells.

We identify gene expression signatures for an enriched vascular smooth muscle cell population (foxc1b + acta2) and all smooth muscle (acta2) using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and RNA-Seq. Finally, we demonstrate that progressive loss of foxc1a/foxc1b results in decreased smooth muscle cell coverage. Together, our data highlight the early cellular dynamics and transcriptome profiles of smooth muscle cells in vivo, using foxc1b as a unique tool to probe vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation.\\n\\nSummary StatementTracing the morphogenesis and transcriptome of early vascular smooth muscle cells using foxc1b",

    "abstract": "The existence of discrete phenotypic traits suggests that the complex regulatory processes which produce them are functionally modular. These processes are usually represented by networks. Only modular networks can be partitioned into intelligible subcircuits able to evolve relatively independently. Traditionally, functional modularity is approximated by detection of modularity in network structure. However, the correlation between structure and function is loose. Many regulatory networks exhibit modular behaviour without structural modularity. Here we partition an experimentally tractable regulatory network--the gap gene system of dipteran insects--using an alternative approach. We show that this system, although not structurally modular, is composed of dynamical modules driving different aspects of whole-network behaviour. All these subcircuits share the same regulatory structure, but differ in components and sensitivity to regulatory interactions. Some subcircuits are in a state of criticality while others are not, which explains the observed differential evolvability of the various expression features in the system.",

    "abstract": "Senescent cells display senescence-associated (SA) phenotypic programs such as proliferation arrest (SAPA) and secretory phenotype (SASP), which mediate their impact on tissue homeostasis. Curiously, senescence-inducing persistent DNA double-strand breaks (pDSBs) cause an immediate DNA damage response (DDR) and SAPA, but SASP requires days to develop, suggesting it requires additional molecular events. Here, we show that pDSBs provoke delayed recruitment of MRN/ATM and KAT5/TRRAP (NuA4/Tip60) complexes to global chromatin. This coincided with activating histone marks on up-regulated SASP genes, whereas depletion of these complexes compromised the SASP. Conversely, histone deacetylase inhibition triggered accelerated MRN/ATM/Tip60-dependent SASP without pDSBs, interlacing acetylation and non-canonical DNA damage-independent, low-level DDR activity in SASP maturation. DDR/acetylation regulation of SA programs is preserved in human cancer cells, suggesting novel targets for modifying treatment-induced SA phenotypes. We propose that delayed chromatin recruitment of acetyltransferases cooperates with non-canonical DDR signaling to ensure SASP activation only in the context of senescence, and not in response to a transient DNA damage-induced proliferation arrest.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTS (4 MAX, 85 CHARACTERS EACH)-Tip60 complex cooperate with non-canonical DDR activity to trigger paracrine signals\\n\\n-Low-level chromatin-associated ATM activity is required for the SASP\\n\\n-The intensity and temporal dynamics of the SASP can be manipulated\\n\\neTOC blurb (40 words)A temporal ballet between DNA damage response ATM/MRN and NuA4/Tip60 complexes control senescence-associated paracrine signals that are important during aging and cancer therapy, suggesting that DNA damage responses, acetylation, and chromatin remodeling can be exploited to manipulate senescence and benefit health.",

    "abstract": "Numerous physiological and pathological phenomena are associated with the quiescent state of a cell. Cellular quiescence is a heterogeneous resting state; cells in deep than shallow quiescence require stronger growth stimulation to exit quiescence and reenter the cell cycle. Despite the importance of quiescent cells such as stem and progenitor cells to tissue homeostasis and repair, cellular mechanisms controlling the depth of cellular quiescence are poorly understood. Here we began by analyzing transcriptome changes as rat embryonic fibroblasts moved progressively deeper into quiescence under increasingly longer periods of serum starvation. We found that lysosomal gene expression was significantly upregulated in deep than shallow quiescence, which compensated for gradually reduced autophagy flux observed during quiescence deepening. Consistently, we show that inhibiting lysosomal function drove cells deeper into quiescence and eventually into a senescence-like irreversibly arrested state. By contrast, increasing lysosomal function progressively pushed cells into shallower quiescence. That is, lysosomal function modulates quiescence depth continuously like a dimmer switch. Mechanistically, we show that lysosomal function prevents quiescence deepening by reducing oxidative stress in the cell. Lastly, we show that a gene expression signature developed by comparing deep and shallow quiescent cells can correctly classify senescent and aging cells in a wide array of cell lines in vitro and tissues in vivo, suggesting that quiescence deepening, senescence, and aging may share common regulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Hyaluronan is emerging as a key player regulating wound repair, inflammation, and angiogenesis. Of the three hyaluronan synthases (HAS1-3), HAS2 is the main driver of tumorigenicity by enhancing hyaluronan deposition. We discovered that HAS2 was degraded in vascular endothelial cells via autophagy, a catabolic process evoked by endorepellin and endostatin, two angiostatic and pro-autophagic effectors, and by Torin 1, a specific mTOR inhibitor. Protracted autophagy increased co-localization of HAS2 with three core components of the autophagosome, LC3, p62, and ATG9A, and binding of HAS2 to ATG9A. Importantly, autophagic induction led to an exclusive and marked suppression of secreted hyaluronan with no significant effects on either heparan or chondroitin sulfate levels. Thus, we have unveiled autophagy as a key catabolic mechanism regulating the production of hyaluronan in endothelial cells. Moreover, our study provides a biological link between autophagy and angiogenesis that could lead to potential targets for tumor neovascularization.\\n\\nSummaryHyaluronan is pro-angiogenic and pro-tumorigenic. We report a novel mechanism through which three autophagic inducers[-]endorepellin, endostatin, and Torin 1[-]regulate the levels of hyaluronan synthase-2.

    "abstract": "Bipolar spindle formation in yeast requires insertion of centrosomes (known as spindle pole bodies (SPBs)) into fenestrated regions of the nuclear envelope (NE). Using structured-illumination microscopy and bimolecular fluorescence complementation, we map protein distribution at SPB fenestra and interrogate protein-protein interactions with high spatial resolution. We find that the Sad1-UNC-84 (SUN) protein Mps3 forms a ring-like structure around the SPB, similar to toroids seen for components of the SPB insertion network (SPIN). Mps3 and the SPIN component Mps2 (a Klarsicht-ANC-1-Syne-1 domain (KASH)-like protein) form a novel non-canonical linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex that is connected in both luminal and extraluminal domains. This hairpin-like LINC complex forms during SPB insertion, suggesting it functions in NE reorganization at the pore membrane. The LINC complex also controls the distribution of a soluble SPIN component Bbp1. Taken together our work shows that Mps3 is a fifth SPIN component and suggests both direct and indirect roles for the LINC complex in NE remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Stem-cell niche signaling is short-range in nature, such that only stem cells but not their differentiating progeny experience self-renewing signals. At the apical tip of the Drosophila testes, 8 to 10 germline stem cells (GSCs) surround the hub, a cluster of somatic cells that function as the major component of the stem cell niche. We have shown that GSCs form microtubule-based nanotubes (MT-nanotubes), which project into the hub cells, serving as the platform for niche signal reception: the receptor Tkv expressed by GSCs localizes to the surface of MT-nanotubes, where it receives the hub-derived ligand Decapentaplegic (Dpp), ensuring the reception of the ligand specifically by stem cells but not by differentiating cells.\n\nHere we show that receptor (Tkv)-ligand (Dpp) interaction at the surface of MT-nanotubes serves a second purpose of dampening the niche signaling: we found that the receptor Tkv and the ligand Dpp are internalized into hub cells and are degraded in the hub cell lysosomes. Perturbation of hub lysosomal function or MT-nanotube formation leads to excess receptor retention within germ cells as well as excess Dpp that diffuses out of the hub, leading to ectopic activation of niche signal in differentiating germ cells. Our results demonstrate that MT-nanotubes plays dual roles in ensuring the short-range nature of the niche signaling by 1) providing exclusive interphase of the niche ligand-receptor interaction and 2) limiting the amount of available ligand-receptor via their degradation.",

The way platelets respond during a clotting process is known to depend on their size, with important physiological consequences. We characterized the cytoskeleton of platelets as a function of their size. In resting Human and Mice platelets, we find a quadradic law between the size of a platelet and the amount of microtubule polymer it contains. We further estimate the length and number of microtubules in the marginal band using Electron and Super-resolution microscopy. In platelets activated with ADP, the marginal band coils as a consequence of cortical contraction driven by actin. We observe that this elastic coiling response is accompanied by a reversible shortening of the marginal band. Moreover, larger platelets have a higher propensity to coil.

We found that the subjects WM-indexing brain activity tracked the number of real-world objects people learned to search for in each context. Moreover, the level of this WM activity predicted the inter-subject variability in behavioral performance.

Recent evidence from germ-free (GF) animals suggests a role for microbiota-gut-brain bidirectional communication in the regulation of myelination. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of microbiota on myelin plasticity and oligodendroglial population dynamics in the mixed-sex BACHD mouse model of HD. Ultrastructural analysis of myelin in the corpus callosum revealed alterations of myelin thickness in BACHD GF compared to specific-pathogen free (SPF) mice, whereas no differences were observed between wild-type (WT) groups. In contrast, myelin compaction was altered in all groups when compared to WT SPF animals. Levels of myelin-related proteins were generally reduced, and the number of mature oligodendrocytes was decreased in the prefrontal cortex under GF compared to SPF conditions, regardless of genotype. Minor differences in commensal bacteria at the family and genera levels were found in the gut microbiota of BACHD and WT animals housed in standard living conditions. Our findings indicate complex effects of a germ-free status on myelin-related characteristics, and highlight the adaptive properties of myelination as a result of environmental manipulation.",
