    "abstract": "The cerebral cortex of awake animals exhibits frequent transitions between diverse non-rhythmic network states. However, it is still unclear how these different activity states emerge within the same network and how each state impacts network function. Here, we demonstrate that model networks of spiking neurons with moderate recurrent interactions dynamically change their asynchronous dynamics depending upon the level of afferent excitation. We found that the model network displayed a spectrum of asynchronous states, ranging from afferent input-dominated (AD) regimes, characterized by unbalanced synaptic currents and sparse firing, to recurrent input-dominated (RD) regimes, characterized by balanced synaptic currents and dense firing. The model predicted regime-specific relationships between several different neural biophysical properties which were all experimentally confirmed by intracellular recordings in the somatosensory cortex of awake mice. Moreover, theoretical analysis showed that AD regimes more precisely encode spatiotemporal patterns of presynaptic activity, while RD regimes better encoded the strength of afferent inputs. These results provide a theoretical foundation for how recurrent neocortical circuits generate non-rhythmic waking states and how these different states modulate the processing of incoming information.",

    "abstract": "SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWIn the mammalian retina, asymmetric inhibitory signals arising from the direction-selective dendrites of GABAergic/cholinergic starburst amacrine cells are thought to be crucial for originating direction selectivity. Contrary to this notion, however, we found that direction selectivity in downstream ganglion cells remains remarkably unaffected when starburst output is rendered non-directional (using a novel strategy combining a conditional GABAA 2 receptor knockout mouse with optogenetics). We show that temporal asymmetries between excitation/inhibition, arising from the differential connectivity patterns of starburst cholinergic and GABAergic synapses to ganglion cells, form the basis for a parallel mechanism generating direction selectivity. We further demonstrate that these distinct mechanisms work in a coordinated way to refine direction selectivity as the stimulus crosses the ganglion cells receptive field. Thus, precise spatiotemporal patterns of inhibition and excitation that shape directional responses in ganglion cells are shaped by two  core mechanisms, both arising from distinct specializations of the starburst network.",

    "abstract": "The context in which reward-paired cues are encountered sets the occasion for appropriate reward-seeking but may also spur inappropriate behaviors such as the renewal of drug-seeking. The psychological processes underlying occasion setting remain unclear as contexts are diffuse and difficult to isolate from other stimuli. To overcome this, we modeled a context as a phasic and discrete event - an occasion setter - which allowed for control over its presentation and influence on cue-driven reward-seeking. This allowed us to directly assess how occasion setters, like contexts, regulate the predictive and motivational significance of Pavlovian cues. Male rats (n=50) were trained in a Pavlovian paradigm where the presentation of an ambiguous conditioned stimulus was reinforced only if preceded by an occasion setting cue. We assessed the motivational value of the occasion setter and conditioned stimulus alone or in combination using conditioned reinforcement. Rats showed enhanced conditioned approach to the reward port during the reward-adjacent conditioned stimulus when it was preceded by the occasion setter. When allowed the opportunity, rats responded more to obtain presentations of the conditioned stimulus in combination with the occasion setter than the conditioned stimulus alone. Critically, rats also worked to obtain presentations of the occasion setter alone more than the conditioned stimulus, and this was resistant to manipulations of the value of the occasion setter. We conclude that occasion setting can act via incentive motivational mechanisms and that, apart from resolving predictive information about ambiguous reward-paired cues, occasion setters themselves generate states of appetitive motivation that can facilitate reward-seeking.",

Horizontal and vertical components of these fixation eye movements are determined by the objects location. However, fixation eye movements also involve a torsional component, which according to Listings law is fully determined by the 2D eye position acquired. According to Von Helmholtz knowledge of the torsion provided by this law alleviates the perceptual interpretation of the image tilt that changes with fixation, a view supported by psychophysical experiments he pioneered. We address the question where and how Listings law is implemented in the visual system and we show that neurons in monkey area V1 use knowledge of torsion to compensate the image tilt associated with specific eye positions as set by Listings law.",

We aimed to dissociate the generators of slow gamma versus theta harmonics with current source density and different LFP decompositions. Hippocampal theta harmonic and slow gamma generators were not dissociable. Moreover, comparison of wavelet, ensemble empirical-mode (EEMD), and Fourier decompositions produced distinct outcomes with wavelet and EEMD failing to resolve high-order theta harmonics well defined by Fourier analysis. The varying sizes of the time-frequency atoms used by wavelet distributed the higher-order harmonics over a broader range giving the impression of a low frequency burst (\\\"slow gamma\\\"). The absence of detectable slow gamma refutes a multiplexed model of cognition in favor of the energy cascade hypothesis in which dependency across oscillatory frequencies exists.",

More than 80% of >65 cell types match between the two regions, but exhibit substantial differences in proportions and gene expression, some of which we relate to functional differences. Comparison of macaque retinal types with those of mice reveals that interneuron types are tightly conserved, but that projection neuron types and programs diverge, despite conserved transcription factor codes. Key macaque types are conserved in humans, allowing mapping of cell-type and region-specific expression of >190 genes associated with 6 human retinal diseases.

Although the events that trigger these errors are not well understood, one candidate is mitotic entry before the completion of DNA replication. To address the impact of mitosis on DNA replication, we employed Xenopus egg extracts. When mitotic CDK (Cyclin B1-CDK1) is used to drive these extracts into mitosis, the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAIP promotes ubiquitylation of the replicative CMG (CDC45/MCM2-7/GINS) helicase at stalled forks and at forks that have completed DNA synthesis. In both cases, ubiquitylation is followed by CMG extraction from chromatin by the CDC48/p97 ATPase. At stalled forks, CMG removal results in fork breakage and complex end joining events involving deletions and template-switching. Our results identify TRAIP-dependent replisome disassembly as a novel trigger of replication fork collapse and propose it underlies complex DNA rearrangements in mitosis.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LITRAIP-dependent MCM7 ubiquitylation removes all CMGs from chromatin in mitosis\\nC_LIO_LICMG unloading from stalled forks causes replication fork breakage\\nC_LIO_LIReplication fork breakage in mitosis causes complex rearrangements\\nC_LIO_LINew model of replication fork collapse\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Debilitating stress fractures are surprisingly common in physically active individuals, including athletes, military recruits, and dancers. These individuals are overrepresented in the 30 million daily users of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We hypothesized that regular use of NSAIDs would predispose habitually loaded bones to stress fracture and delay the repair of these injuries. To test this hypothesis, adult mice were subjected to six bouts of axial forelimb compression over two weeks. Aspirin, naproxen, or vehicle was administered 24 hours before loading. Naproxen-treated mice had diminished load-induced bone formation as well as a significant loss in toughness in non-loaded bone, which were not observed in aspirin-treated mice. Furthermore, there were no differences in RANKL/OPG ratio or cortical bone parameters. Picrosirius red staining and second harmonic generation imaging revealed that alterations in bone collagen fibril size and organization were driving the loss of toughness in naproxen-treated mice. Separately, adult mice were subjected to an ulnar stress fracture generated by a single bout of fatigue loading, with NSAIDs provided 24 hours before injury. Both aspirin-treated and naproxen-treated mice had normal forelimb use in the week after injury, whereas control mice favored the injured forelimb until day 7. However, woven bone volume was only significantly impaired by naproxen. Both NSAIDs were found to significantly inhibit Cox2 and Ngf expression following stress fracture, but only naproxen significantly affected serum PGE2 concentration. Overall, our results suggest that naproxen, but not aspirin, may increase the risk of stress fracture and extend the healing time of these injuries, warranting further clinical evaluation for patients at risk for fatigue injuries.",

    "abstract": "The biophysical relationships between sensors and actuators [1-5] have been fundamental to the development of complex life forms; Abundant flows are generated and persist in aquatic environments by swimming organisms [6-13], while responding promptly to external stimuli is key to survival [14-19]. Here, akin to a chain reaction [20-22], we present the discovery of hydrodynamic trigger waves in cellular communities of the protist Spirostomum ambiguum, propagating hundreds of times faster than the swimming speed. Coiling its cytoskeleton, Spirostomum can contract its long body by 50% within milliseconds [23], with accelerations reaching 14g-forces. Surprisingly, a single cellular contraction (transmitter) is shown to generate long-ranged vortex flows at intermediate Reynolds numbers, which can trigger neighbouring cells, in turn. To measure the sensitivity to hydrodynamic signals (receiver), we further present a high-throughput suction-flow device to probe mechanosensitive ion channel gating [24] by back-calculating the microscopic forces on the cell membrane. These ultra-fast hydrodynamic trigger waves are analysed and modelled quantitatively in a universal framework of antenna and percolation theory [25, 26]. A phase transition is revealed, requiring a critical colony density to sustain collective communication. Our results suggest that this signalling could help organise cohabiting communities over large distances, influencing long-term behaviour through gene expression, comparable to quorum sensing [16]. More immediately, as contractions release toxins [27], synchronised discharges could also facilitate the repulsion of large predators, or conversely immobilise large prey. We postulate that beyond protists numerous other freshwater and marine organisms could coordinate with variations of hydrodynamic trigger waves.",

    "abstract": "Cancer stem cells receive increasing interest because they are believed to be a major reason for long-term therapy failure. The reason for the therapy resistance of cancer stem cells lies partially in their multi-drug resistance and partially in the ability to rest mitotically inactive in the hypoxic center of tumors. Due to their variable number and their often low proliferation rate, cancer stem cells are difficult to purify in decent quantities and to grow in cell culture systems, where they are easily outcompeted by faster growing more  differentiated, i.e. less stem cell-like tumor cells. Here we present a proof of principle study based on the idea to select cancer stem cells by means of the expression of a stem cell-specific gene. We inserted a selectable egfp-neo coding sequence in the last exon of the non-coding murine miR-302 host gene. As a stem cell specific regulatory element, we used 2.1 kb of the genomic region immediately upstream of the miR-302 host gene transcription start. Stable transgenic CJ7 embryonic stem cells were used to induce teratomas. After three weeks, tumors were removed for analysis and primary cultures were established. Stem-like cells were selected from these culture based on G418 selection. When the selection was removed, stem cell morphology and miR-302 expression were rapidly lost, indicating that it were not the original ES cells that have been isolated. In conclusion, we show the possibility to use drug resistance expressed from a regulatory sequence of a stem cell-specific marker, to isolate and propagate cancer stem cells that otherwise might be hidden in the majority of tumor cells.",

In the Caenorhabditis elegans gonad, the broad outlines of germline stem cell (GSC) regulation are the same for both sexes: GLP-1/Notch signaling from the mesenchymal Distal Tip Cell (DTC) niche maintains GSCs in the distal gonad of both sexes (AO_SCPLOWUSTINC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWANDC_SCPLOW KO_SCPLOWIMBLEC_SCPLOW 1987), and does so via two key stem cell regulators, SYGL-1 and LST-1 (KO_SCPLOWERSHNERC_SCPLOW et al. 2014). Most analyses of niche signaling and GSC regulation have focused on XX hermaphrodites, an essentially female sex making sperm in larvae and oocytes in adults. Here we focus on XO males, which are sexually dimorphic in all tissues, including the distal gonad. The architecture of the male niche and the cellular behavior of GSCs are sex-specific. Despite these differences, males maintain a GSC pool similar to the hermaphrodite with respect to size and cell number and the male GSC response to niche signaling is also remarkably similar.",

    "abstract": "Reporting of the actual data in graphs and plots increases transparency and enables independent evaluation. On the other hand, data summaries are often used in graphs since they aid interpretation. State-of-the art data visualizations can be made with the ggplot2 package, which uses the ideas of a  grammar of graphics to generate a graphic from multiple layers of data. However, ggplot2 requires coding skills and an understanding of the tidy data structure. To democratize state-of-the-art data visualization of raw data with a selection of statistical summaries, a web app was written using R/shiny that uses the ggplot2 package for generating plots. A multilayered approach together with adjustable transparency offers a unique flexibility, enabling users can to choose how to display the data and which of the data summaries to add. Four data summaries are provided, mean, median, boxplot, violinplot, to accommodate several types of data distributions. In addition, 95% confidence intervals can be added for visual inferences. By adjusting the transparency of the layers, the visualization of the raw data together with the summary can be tuned for optimal presentation and interpretation.

We developed a simple and fast method called FlashPack for custom packing of capillary columns of 50-100 cm length with sub-2-m sorbent particles. FlashPack uses high sorbent concentrations of 500-1000 mg/ml for packing at relatively low pressure of 100 bar. Column blocking by sorbent aggregation is avoided during the packing of sorbent particles by gentle mechanical tapping of the capillary proximal end by a slowly rotating magnet bar. Utilizing a standard 100 bar pressure bomb, Flashpack allows for production of 15-25 cm cUHPLC columns within a few minutes and of 50 cm cUHPLC columns in less than an hour. Columns exhibit excellent reproducibility of back-pressure, retention time and resolution (CV 8,7 %). FlashPack cUHPLC columns are inexpensive, robust and deliver performance comparable to commercially available cUHPLC columns. The FlashPack method is versatile and enables production of cUHPLC columns using a variety of sorbent materials.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR/Cas9 revolution is profoundly changing the way life sciences technologies are used. Many assays now rely on engineered clonal cell lines to eliminate overexpression of bait proteins. Control cell lines are typically non-engineered cells or engineered clones implying a considerable risk for artefacts because of clonal variation. Genome engineering can also transform BioID, a proximity labelling method that relies on fusing a bait protein to a promiscuous biotin ligase, BirA*, resulting in the tagging of vicinal proteins. We here propose an innovative design to enable BioID for endogenous proteins wherein we introduce a T2A-BirA* module at the C-terminus of endogenous p53 by genome engineering, leading to bi-cistronic expression of both p53 and BirA* under control of the endogenous promoter. By targeting a Cas9-cytidine deaminase base editor to the T2A auto-cleavage site, we can efficiently derive an isogenic population expressing a functional p53-BirA* fusion protein. Using quantitative proteomics we show significant benefits over classical ectopic expression of p53-BirA*, and we provide a first well-controlled view on the proximal proteins of endogenous p53 in colon carcinoma cells. This novel application for base editors expands the CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox and can be a valuable addition for synthetic biology.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=142 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/427807v2_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@404da1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a8af36org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18741a6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e73ab3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Bacterial ClpB and yeast Hsp104 are homologous Hsp100 protein disaggregases that serve critical functions in proteostasis by solubilizing protein aggregates. Two AAA+ nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) power polypeptide translocation through a central channel comprised of a hexameric spiral of protomers that contact substrate via conserved pore-loop interactions. To elucidate the translocation mechanism, we determined the cryo-EM structure of a hyperactive ClpB variant to 2.9 [A] resolution bound to the model substrate, casein in the presence of slowly hydrolysable ATP{gamma}S. Distinct substrate-gripping mechanisms are identified for NBD1 and NBD2 pore loops. A trimer of N-terminal domains define a channel entrance that binds the polypeptide substrate adjacent the topmost NBD1 contact. NBD conformations at the spiral seam reveal how ATP hydrolysis and substrate engagement or disengagement are precisely tuned to drive a stepwise translocation cycle.",

    "abstract": "SignificanceFOXN1 is a transcription factor that is essential for the development of the thymus and the production of T-lymphocytes. It is a member of a large family of transcription factors which recognize DNA sequences through the conserved Forkhead (FH) domain. FOXN1 recognizes a DNA sequence that is different from the common consensus binding sequence of FH domains, although key binding residues are identical. We present crystal structures of the FH domain of FOXN1, free and DNA-bound, which shed light on the different binding specificities; the structure also revelas the basis of the immunocompromised nude mutation, as well as a preferential binding to non-methylated CpG motifs.\\n\\nAbstractFOXN1 is a member of the forkhead box (FOX) family of transcription factors, and plays an important role in thymic epithelial cell differentiation and function. FOXN1 mutations in humans and mice give rise to the \\\"nude\\\" phenotype which is marked by athymia. FOXN1 belongs to a subset of the FOX family that recognize an alternate consensus sequence (GACGC), which is different from the more widely-recognized canonical sequence consensus RYAAAYA. Here, we present the structure of FOXN1 in complex with DNA at 1.6 [A] resolution, in which the DNA sequence is recognised by a mixture of direct and water-mediated contacts provided by residues in an a-helix inserted in the DNA major groove (the recognition helix). Comparisons with other FOX family structures reveal that the canonical and alternate DNA sequences are bound in two distinct modes, with partially different registers for the protein DNA contacts. We identify a single alternate rotamer within the recognition helix itself as an important determinant of DNA specificity, and indicate sequence features in the recognition helix that could be used to predict the specificity of other FOX family members. Finally we demonstrate that FOXN1 has a significantly reduced affinity for DNA containing 5-methylcytosine, which may have implications for the role of FOXN1 in thymic senescence.",

    "abstract": "Summary statementThis article highlights several molecular mechanisms that result in the assembly of integrin V{beta}5-containing flat clathrin lattices in human keratinocytes.\\n\\nAbstractThe family of integrin transmembrane receptors is essential for the normal function of multicellular organisms by facilitating cell-extracellular matrix adhesion. The vitronectin-binding integrin V{beta}5 localizes to focal adhesions (FAs) as well as poorly characterized flat clathrin lattices (FCLs). Here we show that in human keratinocytes V{beta}5 is predominant found in FCLs and that formation of the V{beta}5-containing FCLs requires the presence of vitronectin as ligand, calcium, and the clathrin adaptor proteins ARH, Numb, and EPS15/EPS15L1. Integrin chimeras, containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of {beta}5 and the cytoplasmic domains of {beta}1 or {beta}3, almost exclusively localize in FAs. Interestingly, lowering actomyosin-mediated contractility promotes integrin redistribution to FLCs in an integrin tail-dependent manner, while increasing cellular tension favors V{beta}5 clustering in FAs. Our findings strongly indicate that clustering of integrin V{beta}5 in FCLs is dictated by the {beta}5 subunit cytoplasmic domain, cellular tension, and recruitment of specific adaptor proteins to the {beta}5 subunit cytoplasmic domains.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe TUBA1A-associated tubulinopathy is clinically heterogeneous with brain malformations, microcephaly, developmental delay and epilepsy being the main clinical features. It is an autosomal dominant disorder mostly caused by de novo variants in TUBA1A.\\n\\nResultsIn three individuals with developmental delay we identified heterozygous de novo missense variants in TUBA1A using exome sequencing. While the c.1307G>A, p.(Gly436Asp) variant was novel, the two variants c.518C>T, p.(Pro173Leu) and c.641G>A, p.(Arg214His) were previously described. We compared the variable phenotype observed in these individuals with a carefully conducted review of the current literature and identified 166 individuals, 146 born and 20 fetuses with a TUBA1A variant. In 107 cases with available clinical information we standardized the reported phenotypes according to the Human Phenotype Ontology. The most commonly reported features were developmental delay (98%), anomalies of the corpus callosum (96%), microcephaly (76%) and lissencephaly (70%), although reporting was incomplete in the different studies. We identified a total of 121 distinct variants, including 15 recurrent ones. Missense variants cluster in the C-terminal region around the most commonly affected amino acid position Arg402 (13.3%). In a three-dimensional protein modelling, 38.6% of all disease causing variants including those in the C-terminal region are predicted to affect binding of microtubule-associated proteins or motor proteins. Genotype-phenotype analysis for recurrent variants showed an overrepresentation of certain clinical features. However, individuals with these variants are often reported in the same publication.\\n\\nConclusionsWith 166 individuals, we present the most comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic standardized synopsis for clinical interpretation of TUBA1A variants. Despite this considerable number, a detailed genotype-phenotype characterization is limited by large inter-study variability in reporting.",
