    "abstract": "BackgroundSustainable Development Goals set a challenge for the elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection as a public health concern by the year 2030. Deployment of a robust prophylactic vaccine and enhanced interventions for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) are cornerstones of elimination strategy. However, in light of the estimated global burden of 290 million cases, enhanced efforts are required to underpin optimisation of public health strategy. Robust analysis of population epidemiology is particularly crucial for populations in Africa made vulnerable by HIV co-infection, poverty, stigma and poor access to prevention, diagnosis and treatment.\\n\\nMethodsWe here set out to evaluate the current and future role of HBV vaccination and PMTCT as tools for elimination. We first investigated the current impact of paediatric vaccination in a cohort of children with and without HIV infection in Kimberley, South Africa. Second, we used these data to inform a new model to simulate the ongoing impact of preventive interventions. By applying these two approaches in parallel, we are able to determine both the current impact of interventions, and the future projected outcome of ongoing preventive strategies over time.\\n\\nResultsExisting efforts have been successful in reducing paediatric prevalence of HBV infection in this setting to <1%, demonstrating the success of the existing vaccine campaign. Our model predicts that, if consistently deployed, combination efforts of vaccination and PMTCT can significantly reduce population prevalence (HBsAg) by 2030, such that a major public health impact is possible even without achieving elimination. However, the prevalence of HBV e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive carriers will decline more slowly, representing a persistent population reservoir. We show that HIV co-infection significantly reduces titres of vaccine-mediated antibody, but has a relatively minor role in influencing the projected time to elimination. Our model can also be applied to other settings in order to predict time to elimination based on specific interventions.\\n\\nConclusionsThrough extensive deployment of preventive strategies for HBV, significant positive public health impact is possible, although time to HBV elimination as a public health concern is likely to be substantially longer than that proposed by current goals.",

We also show that the family ascertainment process can lead to apparent anticipation in the age of onset.

    "abstract": "Hereditary retinal degenerations (HRDs) are Mendelian diseases characterized by progressive blindness and caused by ultra-rare mutations. In a genomic screen of 331 unrelated Japanese patients, we identify a disruptive Alu insertion and a nonsense variant (p.Arg1933*) in the ciliary gene RP1, neither of which are rare alleles in Japan. p.Arg1933* is almost polymorphic (frequency = 0.6%, amongst 12,000 individuals), does not cause disease in homozygosis or heterozygosis, and yet is significantly enriched in HRD patients (frequency = 2.1%, i.e. a 3.5-fold enrichment; p-value = 9.2x10-5). Familial co-segregation and association analyses show that p.Arg1933* can act as a Mendelian mutation, in trans with the Alu insertion, but might also cause disease in association with two alleles in the EYS gene in a non-Mendelian pattern of heredity. Our results suggest that rare conditions such as HRDs can be paradoxically determined by relatively common variants, following a quasi-Mendelian model linking monogenic and complex inheritance.",

    "abstract": "Many animal and plant species respond to high or low population densities by phenotypic plasticity. To investigate if specific age classes and/or cross-generational signaling affect(s) phenotypic plasticity, we developed a dye-based method to differentiate co-occurring nematode age classes. We applied this method to Pristionchus pacificus, which develops a predatory mouth form to exploit alternative resources and kill competitors in response to high population densities. Remarkably, only adult, but not juvenile, crowding induces the predatory morph in other juveniles. Profiling of secreted metabolites throughout development with HPLC-MS combined with genetic mutants traced this result to the production of adult-specific pheromones. Specifically, the P. pacificus-specific di-ascaroside#1 that induces the predatory morph exhibits a binary induction in adults, even though mouth form is no longer plastic in adults. This cross-generational signaling between adults and juveniles may serve as an indication of rapidly increasing population size. Thus, phenotypic plasticity depends on critical age classes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOf the many genetic mutations known to increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder, a large proportion cluster upon synaptic proteins. One such family of presynaptic proteins are the neurexins (NRXN), and recent genetic and mouse evidence has suggested a causative role for NRXN2 in generating altered social behaviours. Autism has been conceptualised as a disorder of atypical connectivity, yet how single-gene mutations affect such connectivity remains under-explored. To attempt to address this, we have developed a quantitative analysis of microstructure and structural connectivity leveraging diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) with high-resolution 3D imaging in optically cleared (CLARITY) brain tissue in the same mouse, applied here to the Nrxn2 knockout (KO) model.\n\nMethodsFixed brains of Nrxn2 KO mice underwent DTI using 9.4T MRI, and diffusion properties of socially-relevant brain regions were quantified. The same tissue was then subjected to CLARITY to immunolabel axons and cell bodies, which were also quantified.\n\nResultsDTI revealed decreases in fractional anisotropy and increases in apparent diffusion coefficient in the amygdala (including the basolateral nuclei), the anterior cingulate cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Radial diffusivity of the anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex was significantly increased in Nrxn2 KO mice, as were tracts between the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex. Using CLARITY, we find significantly altered axonal orientation in the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, which was unrelated to cell density.\n\nConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that deleting a single neurexin gene (Nrxn2) induces atypical structural connectivity within socially-relevant brain regions. More generally, our combined within-subject DTI and CLARITY approach presents a new, more sensitive method of revealing hitherto undetectable differences in the autistic brain.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing view on murine hematopoiesis and on hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in particular derives from experiments that are related to regeneration after irradiation and HSC transplantation. However, over the past years, different experimental techniques have been developed to investigate hematopoiesis under homeostatic conditions, thereby providing access to proliferation and differentiation rates of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the unperturbed situation. Moreover, it has become clear that hematopoiesis undergoes distinct changes during aging with large effects on HSC abundance, lineage contribution, asymmetry of division and self-renewal potential. However, it is currently not fully resolved how stem and progenitor cells interact to respond to varying demands and how this balance is altered by an aging-induced shift in HSC polarity.\\n\\nHere, we present an in-silico model to investigate the dynamics of HSC response to varying demand. By introducing an internal feedback between stem and progenitor cells, the model is suited to consistently describe both hematopoietic homeostasis and regeneration, including the limited regulation of HSCs in the homeostatic situation. The model further explains the age-dependent increase in phenotypic HSCs as a consequence of the cells inability to preserve divisional asymmetry.\\n\\nOur model suggests a dynamically regulated population of intrinsically asymmetrically dividing HSCs as suitable control mechanism that adheres with many qualitative and quantitative findings on hematopoietic recovery after stress and aging. The modeling approach thereby illustrates how a mathematical formalism can support the conceptual and the quantitative understanding of regulatory principles in HSC biology.",

Yet, classical game theory assumes that players act either strictly sequentially or strictly simultaneously (without knowing the choices of each other). To account for action visibility and provide a more realistic model of interactions under time constraints, we introduce a new game-theoretic setting called transparent game, where each player has a certain probability to observe the choice of the partner before deciding on its own action. Using evolutionary simulations, we demonstrate that even a small probability of seeing the partners choice before ones own decision substantially changes evolutionary successful strategies. Action visibility enhances cooperation in a Bach-or-Stravinsky game, but disrupts cooperation in a more competitive iterated Prisoners Dilemma. In both games, strategies based on the \"Win-stay, lose-shift\" and \"Tit-for-tat\" principles are predominant for moderate transparency, while for high transparency strategies of \"Leader-Follower\" type emerge. Our results have implications for studies of human and animal social behaviour, especially for the analysis of dyadic and group interactions.",

    "abstract": "Model approaches to nuclear architecture have traditionally ignored the biophysical consequences of ATP-fueled active processes acting on chromatin. However, transcription-coupled activity is a source of stochastic forces that are substantially larger than the Brownian forces present at physiological temperatures. Here, we describe a first-principles approach to large-scale nuclear architecture in metazoans that incorporates cell-type-specific active processes. The model predicts the statistics of positional distributions, shapes and overlaps of each chromosome. Our simulations reproduce common organising principles underlying large-scale nuclear architecture across human cell nuclei in interphase. These include the differential positioning of euchromatin and heterochromatin, the territorial organisation of chromosomes including both gene-density-based and size-based chromosome radial positioning schemes, the non-random locations of chromosome territories and the shape statistics of individual chromosomes. We propose that the biophysical consequences of the distribution of transcriptional activity across chromosomes should be central to any chromosome positioning code.",

    "abstract": "Terminal differentiation generates the specialized features and functions that allow postmitotic cells to acquire their distinguishing characteristics. This process is thought to be controlled by transcription factors called \\\"terminal selectors\\\" that directly activate a set of downstream effector genes. In Caenorhabditis elegans the differentiation of both the mechanosensory touch receptor neurons (TRNs) and the multidendritic nociceptor FLP neurons utilize the terminal selectors UNC-86 and MEC-3. The FLP neurons fail to activate TRN genes, however, because a complex of two transcriptional repressors (EGL-44/EGL-46) prevents their expression. Here we show that the ZEB family transcriptional factor ZAG-1 promotes TRN differentiation not by activating TRN genes but by preventing the expression of EGL-44/EGL-46. Since EGL-44/EGL-46 also inhibits the production of ZAG-1, these proteins form a bistable, negative feedback loop that regulates the choice between the two neuronal fates.\\n\\nSummary statementTranscriptional repressors regulate binary fate choices through reciprocal inhibition during terminal neuronal differentiation. Specifically, ZEB family transcription factor safeguards fate specification of touch receptor neuron by inhibiting TEA domain-containing repressor.",

This reporter, closely resembling endogenous APP, revealed only a limited correlation between synaptic activities and APP trafficking. However, the synaptic surface distribution of APP was inversely correlated to membrane cholesterol levels, a phenomenon that involves APPs cholesterol-binding site.

Selected features were later used to build Bayesian Networks, revealing causal relationships between features and ICU outcome. The main result is a subset of predictive features that includes well-known indicators such as the SOFA and APACHE II scores, but also less commonly considered ones related to cardiovascular function assessed through echocardiograpy or shock treatment with pressors. Importantly, certain selected features are shown to be most predictive at certain time-steps. This means that, as shock progresses, different attributes could be prioritized.

We sought to validate the use of EHR data of PCS patients by comparing two diagnostic algorithms.\\n\\nMethodsVanderbilt University Medical Center curates a de-identified database of 2.8 million patient EHR. We developed two EHR-based algorithmic approaches that identified individuals with PCS by: (i) natural language processing (NLP) of narrative text in the EHR combined with structured demographic, diagnostic, and encounter data; or (ii) coded billing and procedure data. The predictive value of each algorithm was assessed, and cases and controls identified by each approach were compared on demographic and medical characteristics.\\n\\nResultsFirst, the NLP algorithm identified 507 cases and 10,857 controls. The positive predictive value (PPV) in the cases was 82% and the negative predictive value in the controls was 78%. Second, the coded algorithm identified 1,142 patients with two or more PCS billing codes and had a PPV of 76%. Comparisons of PCS controls to both case groups recovered known epidemiology of PCS: cases were more likely than controls to be female and to have pre-morbid diagnoses of anxiety, migraine, and PTSD. In contrast, controls and cases were equally likely to have ADHD and learning disabilities, in accordance with the findings of recent systematic reviews of PCS risk factors.\\n\\nConclusionsEHR are a valuable research tool for PCS. Ascertainment based on coded data alone had a predictive value comparable to an NLP algorithm, recovered known PCS risk factors, and maximized the number of included patients.",

    "abstract": "Theories of adult brain development, based on neuropsychological test results and structural neuroimaging, suggest differential rates of age-related change in function across cortical and subcortical sub-regions. However, it remains unclear if these trends also extend to the aging dopamine system. Here we examined cross-sectional adult age differences in estimates of D2-like receptor binding potential across several cortical and subcortical brain regions using PET imaging and the radiotracer [18F]fallypride in two samples of healthy human adults (combined N = 132). After accounting for regional differences in overall radioligand binding, estimated percent difference in receptor binding potential by decade (linear effects) were highest in most temporal and frontal cortical regions ([~]6-16% per decade), moderate in parahippocampal gyrus, pregenual frontal cortex, fusiform gyrus, caudate, putamen, thalamus, and amygdala ([~]3-5%), and weakest in subcallosal frontal cortex, ventral striatum, pallidum, and hippocampus ([~]0-2%). Some regions showed linear effects of age while many showed curvilinear effects such that binding potential declined from young adulthood to middle age and then was relatively stable until old age. Overall, these data indicate that the rate and pattern of decline in D2 receptor availability is regionally heterogeneous. However, the differences across regions were challenging to organize within existing theories of brain development and did not show the same pattern of regional change that has been observed in gray matter volume, white matter integrity, or cognitive performance. This variation suggests that existing theories of adult brain development may need to be modified to better account for the spatial dynamics of dopaminergic system aging.",

    "abstract": "Proteins search their vast conformational space in order to attain the native fold and bind productively to relevant biological partners. In particular, most proteins must be able to alternate between at least one active conformational state and back to an inactive conformer, especially for the macromolecules that perform work and need to optimize energy usage. This property may be invoked by a physical stimulus (temperature, radiation) or by a chemical ligand, and may occur through mapping of the protein external environment onto a subset of protein conformers. We have stimulated with temperature cycles two partners of an immune complex before and after assembly, and revealed that properties of the external stimulus (period, phase) are also found in the characteristics of the immune complex (i.e. periodic variations in the binding affinity). These results are important for delineating the bases of molecular memory ex vivo and could serve in the optimization of protein based sensors.",

    "abstract": "Many important situations require human observers to simultaneously search for more than one object. Despite a long history of research into visual search, the behavioral and neural mechanisms associated with multiple-target search are poorly understood. Here we test the novel theory that the efficiency of looking for multiple targets critically depends on the mode of cognitive control the environment affords to the observer. We used an innovative combination of EEG and eye tracking while participants searched for two targets, within two different contexts: Either both targets were present in the search display and observers were free to prioritize either one of them, thus enabling proactive control over selection; or only one of the two targets would be present in each search display, which requires reactive control to reconfigure selection when the wrong target is prioritized. During proactive control, both univariate and multivariate signals of beta-band (15-35 Hz) power suppression prior to display onset predicted switches between target selections. This signal originated over midfrontal and sensorimotor regions and has previously been associated with endogenous state changes. In contrast, imposed target selections requiring reactive control elicited prefrontal power enhancements in the delta/theta-band (2-8 Hz), but only after display onset. This signal predicted individual differences in associated oculomotor switch costs, reflecting reactive reconfiguration of target selection. The results provide compelling evidence that multiple target representations are differentially prioritized during visual search, and for the first time reveal distinct neural mechanisms underlying proactive and reactive control over multiple-target search.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSearching for more than one object in complex visual scenes can be detrimental for search performance. While perhaps annoying in daily life, this can have severe consequences in professional settings such as medical and security screening. Previous research has not yet resolved whether multiple-target search involves changing priorities in what people attend to, and how such changes are controlled. We approached these questions by concurrently measuring cortical activity and eye movements using EEG and eye tracking, while observers searched for multiple possible targets. Our findings provide the first unequivocal support for the existence of two modes of control during multiple-target search, which are expressed in qualitatively distinct time-frequency signatures of the EEG both before and after visual selection.",

    "abstract": "In each cell cycle, centrioles are duplicated to produce a single copy of each pre-existing centriole. At the onset of centriole duplication, the master regulator Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) undergoes a dynamic change in its spatial pattern on the periphery of the pre-existing centriole, forming a single duplication site. However, the significance and mechanisms of this pattern transition remain largely unknown. Using super-resolution imaging, we found that centriolar Plk4 exhibits periodic discrete patterns resembling pearl necklaces, frequently with single prominent foci. We constructed mathematical models that simulated the pattern formation of Plk4 to gain insight into the discrete ring patterns. The simulations incorporating the self-organization properties of Plk4 successfully generated the experimentally observed patterns. We therefore propose that the self-patterning of Plk4 is crucial for the regulation of centriole duplication. These results, defining the mechanisms of self-organized regulation, provide a fundamental principle for understanding centriole duplication.",

    "abstract": "Mangrove ecosystem responses to tropical cyclones have been well documented over the last half a century, resulting in repeated measures of tree mortality, aboveground biomass reduction, and recovery by species, size, and geomorphology. However, no studies have investigated the role of urbanization in mangrove hurricane resistance and resilience, despite increasing urbanization of tropical shorelines. This study gauges the initial response and short-term recovery of Puerto Ricos mangroves along well defined and quantified urban gradients following the 2017 hurricane season. Survival probability of tagged trees decreased with time, and the mean mortality across all sites was 22% after eleven months. Mean canopy closure loss was 51% one month after the hurricanes, and closure rates also decreased with time following the storms. Aboveground biomass accumulation decreased by 3.5 kg yr-1 per tree, corresponding to a reduction of 4.5 Mg ha-1 yr-1 at the stand level. One year later, the mangroves have recovered to 72% canopy closure and to nearly 60% of their pre-storm growth rates. No connection to urbanization could be detected in the measured dynamics. Instead, species, size and geomorphology were found to play a role. Larger trees suffered 25% more mortality than smaller size classes, and Laguncularia racemosa suffered 11% less mortality than other species. Hydro-geomorphology was also found to play a role, with forests in tidally restricted canals experiencing more canopy loss but faster recovery than open embayment systems. These findings suggest size, species, and geomorphology are important in mangrove resistance and resilience to tropical storms, and that urbanization does not play a role. Managing mangrove ecosystems for optimal shoreline protection will depend upon knowing which forests are at greatest risk in a future of increasing urbanization.",

    "abstract": "Morphogenesis often yields organs with robust size and shapes, whereas cell growth and deformation feature significant spatio-temporal variability. Here, we investigate whether tissue responses to mechanical signals contribute to resolve this apparent paradox. We built a model of growing tissues made of fiber-like material, which may account for the cytoskeleton, polar cell-cell adhesion, or the extracellular matrix in animals, and for the cell wall in plants. We considered the synthesis and remodeling of this material, as well as the modulation of synthesis by isotropic and anisotropic response to mechanical stress. Formally, our model describes an expanding, mechanoresponsive, nematic, and active fluid. We show that mechanical responses buffer localized perturbations, with two possible regimes - hypo-responsive and hyper-responsive, and the transition between the two corresponds to a minimum value of the relaxation time. Whereas robustness of shapes suggests that growth fluctuations are confined to small scales, our model yields growth fluctuations that have long-range correlations. This indicates that growth fluctuations are a significant source of heterogeneity in development. Nevertheless, we find that mechanical responses may dampen such fluctuations, with a specific magnitude of anisotropic response that minimizes heterogeneity of tissue contours. We finally discuss how our predictions might apply to the development of plants and animals. Altogether, our results call for the systematic quantification of fluctuations in growing tissues.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the present experiments was to determine whether electrophysiological response properties of the ON and OFF visual pathways observed in animal experimental models can be observed in human. Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) were recorded in response to equivalent magnitude contrast increments and decrements presented using sawtooth temporal waveforms at a temporal frequency of 2.73 Hz. VEP response waveforms and response spectra for incremental and decremental stimuli were analyzed as a function of stimulus size and visual field location in 68 healthy adult participants. VEP response were larger in amplitude and shorter in latency for contrast decrements than for contrast increments. The spatial tuning was narrower for contrast decrements than for contrast increments and responses were larger for displays that were scaled for cortical magnification. VEPs recorded at the scalp differ between contrast decrements and increments of equal Weber contrast in a fashion that parallels results from the early visual system of cats and monkeys. Because our assay allows differential detection of ON and OFF pathway activity in human, the approach may be useful in future work on disease detection and treatment monitoring.",

Here, we show that junction-mediating and regulatory protein (JMY), an actin regulating protein, also affects endocytic vesicle trafficking and Sertoli cell junction remodeling since disruption of these functions induced male subfertility in Sertoli cell-specific Jmy knockout mice. Specifically, these mice have: a) impaired BTB integrity and spermatid adhesion in the seminiferous tubules; b) high incidence of sperm structural deformity; c) reduced sperm count and poor sperm motility. Moreover, the cytoskeletal integrity in Sertoli cell-specific Jmy knockout mice was compromised along with endocytic vesicular trafficking. These effects impaired junctional protein recycling and reduced Sertoli cell junctions. In addition, JMY interaction with -actinin1 and Sorbs2 was related to JMY activity and in turn actin cytoskeletal organization. In summary, JMY affects control of spermatogenesis through regulating actin filament organization and endocytic vesicle trafficking in Sertoli cells.",

In the absence of Endoglycan, commissural axons failed to properly navigate the midline of the spinal cord. In the developing cerebellum, a lack of Endoglycan prevented migration of Purkinje cells and resulted in a stunted growth of the cerebellar lobes.

Using primary astrocytes in a wound healing assay, we show that these tubulin modifications are independently regulated during cell polarization and differently affect cell migration. In contrast to microtubule detyrosination, TAT1-mediated microtubule acetylation increases in the vicinity of focal adhesions and promotes cell migration. We further demonstrate that TAT1 increases focal adhesion turnover by promoting Rab6-positive vesicle fusion at focal adhesions. Our results highlight the specificity of microtubule post-translational modifications and bring new insight into the regulatory functions of tubulin acetylation.",

Although the functional organisation of specific cells within the retina has been well-studied, the molecular profile of many cell types remains unclear in humans.

Using unsupervised clustering analysis, we identified 18 transcriptionally distinct clusters representing all known retinal cells: rod photoreceptors, cone photoreceptors, Muller glia cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells, retinal astrocytes and microglia. Notably, our data captured molecular profiles for healthy and early degenerating rod photoreceptors, and revealed a novel role of MALAT1 in putative rod degeneration. We also demonstrated the use of this retina transcriptome atlas to benchmark pluripotent stem cell-derived cone photoreceptors and an adult Muller glia cell line. This work provides an important reference with unprecedented insights into the transcriptional landscape of human retinal cells, which is fundamental to our understanding of retinal biology and disease.",

In some contexts, like embryonic development, signal transduction plays crucial roles in cell fate determination and differentiation, while in developed organisms some of this processes contribute in the maintenance of the structural integrity of tissues.\\n\\nTumor cells are recognized as having deregulated signaling which leads to a series of abnormal behaviors known as the hallmarks of cancer. Although gene regulation is often viewed as the last step in signal transduction, transcriptional regulation of the components of a pathway may impact in the long term deregulation observed in tumors. The study of gene regulatory networks centered around genes of the signal transduction pathways allows the identification of transcriptional regulators with the greatest influence over the signal transduction gene signature, also denominated Master Regulators.\\n\\nIn this work we identify, the master regulators that regulate the expression of genes of 25 relevant pathways grouped in KEGG within the category of signal transduction in a breast cancer dataset. For this purpose we implemented a modified MARINa algorithm that identifies, from a network of regulons, those that possess more differentially expressed genes related to the process to be studied. We identified CLOCK, TSHZ2, HOXA2, MEIS2, HOXA3, HAND2, HOXA5, TBX18, PEG3 and GLI2 as the top 10 master regulators of signaling pathways in breast cancer. Nine of them are recognized for taking part in embryonic development associated processes.\\n\\nIndividual enrichment GO biological function for each TMR regulons showed to be significantly enriched in embryonic development related processes.

The reports of human-to-human transmission documented in Bangladesh has raised the specter of pandemic potential and has caused the World Health Organization to list the Nipah virus as one of the pathogens to be considered for development of drugs and vaccines on urgent basis, neither of which exist against the Nipah virus as of now, although many proposals have been made and trials initiated. Given that there are established country-specific differences in the virus effects and fatalities, meeting the sudden need for a vaccine in case of an epidemic will require design, development and preparation for a peptide vaccine. Thus, we propose a protocol for creating peptide vaccines that can be tailor-made for these specific countries, an approach which is being advocated for the first time. Here, we analyze the surface proteins, Fusion protein and Glycoprotein, of the strains currently affecting the three countries on a large scale and determine the specific country-based epitope differences.",

    "abstract": "Rapid, accurate prediction of protein structure from amino acid sequence would accelerate fields as diverse as drug discovery, synthetic biology and disease diagnosis. Massively improved prediction of protein structures has been driven by improving the prediction of the amino acid residues that contact in their 3D structure. For an average globular protein, around 92% of all residue pairs are non-contacting, therefore accurate prediction of only a small percentage of inter-amino acid distances could increase the number of constraints to guide structure determination. We have trained deep neural networks to predict inter-residue contacts and distances. Distances are predicted with an accuracy better than most contact prediction techniques. Addition of distance constraints improved de novo structure predictions for test sets of 158 protein structures, as compared to using the best contact prediction methods alone. Importantly, usage of distance predictions allows the selection of better models from the structure pool without a need for an external model assessment tool. The results also indicate how the accuracy of distance prediction methods might be improved further.",

    "abstract": "High dimensional data, for example from infrared spectral imaging, involves an inherent trade-off in the acquisition time and quality of spatial-spectral data. Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) developed by Green et al. [1] has been extensively studied as an algorithm for noise removal in HSI (Hyper-Spectral Imaging) data. However, there is a speed-accuracy trade-off in the process of manually deciding the relevant bands in the MNF space, which by current methods could become a person month time for analyzing an entire TMA (Tissue Micro Array). We propose three approaches termed  Fast MNF,  Approx MNF and  Rand MNF where the computational time of the algorithm is reduced, as well as the entire process of band selection is fully automated. This automated approach is shown to perform at the same level of reconstruction accuracy as MNF with large speedup factors, resulting in the same task to be accomplished in hours. The different approximations of the algorithm, show the reconstruction accuracy vs storage (50x) and runtime speed (60x) trade-off. We apply the approach for automating the denoising of different tissue histology samples, in which the accuracy of classification (differentiating between the different histologic and pathologic classes) strongly depends on the SNR (signal to noise ratio) of recovered data. Therefore, we also compare the effect of the proposed denoising algorithms on classification accuracy. Since denoising HSI data is done without any ground truth, we also use a metric that assesses the quality of denoising in the image domain between the noisy and denoised image in absence of ground truth.",

    "abstract": "Ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation is harmful for living organisms but in low doses may stimulate cell proliferation. Our aim was to examine the relationships between exposure to different low UVA doses, cellular proliferation, and changes in cellular reactive oxygen species levels. In human colon cancer (HCT116) and melanoma (Me45) cells exposed to UVA doses comparable to environmental, the highest doses (30-50 kJ/m2) reduced clonogenic potential but some lower doses (1 and 10 kJ/m2) induced proliferation. This effect was cell type and dose specific. In both cell lines the levels of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide fluctuated with dynamics which were influenced differently by UVA; in Me45 cells decreased proliferation accompanied the changes in the dynamics of H2O2 while in HCT116 cells those of superoxide. Genes coding for proteins engaged in redox systems were expressed differently in each cell line; transcripts for thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin and glutathione peroxidase showed higher expression in HCT116 cells whereas those for glutathione transferases and copper chaperone were more abundant in Me45 cells. We conclude that these two cell types utilize different pathways for regulating their redox status. Many mechanisms engaged in maintaining cellular redox balance have been described. Here we show that the different cellular responses to a stimulus such as a specific dose of UVA may be consequences of the use of different redox control pathways. Assays of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide level changes after exposure to UVA may clarify mechanisms of cellular redox regulation and help in understanding responses to stressing factors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRabies is endemic in southern Bhutan, associated with 1-2 human deaths annually and accounting for about 6% of annual national expenditure on essential medicines. A WHO-adapted National Rabies Management Guidelines (NRMG) is available to aid clinicians in PEP prescription. An understanding of clinical practice in the evaluation of rabies risk in endemic areas could contribute to improve clinicians PEP decision-making.\\n\\nMethodsA cross-sectional survey of clinicians was conducted in 13 health centers in high-rabies-risk areas of Bhutan during February-March 2016. Data were collected from 273 patients examined by 50 clinicians.\\n\\nResultsThe majority (69%) of exposure was through dog bites. Half the patients were children under 18 years of age. Consultations were conducted by health assistants or clinical officers (55%), or by medical doctors (45%), with a median age of clinicians of 31 years. Rabies vaccines were prescribed in 91% of exposure cases. The overall agreement between clinicians rabies risk assessment and the NRMG for the corresponding exposure was low (kappa =0.203, p<0.001). Clinicians were more likely to underestimate the risk of exposure than overestimate it. Male health assistants were the most likely to make an accurate risk assessment and female health assistants were the least likely. Clinicians from district or regional hospitals were more likely to conduct accurate risk assessments compared to clinicians in Basic Health Units (Odds Ratios of 7.8 and 17.6, respectively).\\n\\nConclusionsThis study highlighted significant discrepancies between clinical practice and guideline recommendations for rabies risk evaluation. Regular training about rabies risk assessment and PEP prescription should target all categories of clinicians. An update of the NRMG with more specific criterions for the prescription of RIG might contribute to increase the compliance, along with a regular review of decision-making criteria to monitor adherence to the NRMG.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHuman rabies remains an important public health threat in Bhutan, especially in southern regions where canine rabies is endemic. The steady increase in number of patients reporting to hospitals following dog bites means escalating costs of post-exposure prophylaxis for the country. We investigated attitudes and practices of clinicians who manage patients with potential rabies exposure, in the endemic area. The risk of rabies exposure in the study area is mostly associated with dog bites, involving children half the time. Rabies vaccines were prescribed in 9 out of 10 exposure cases, while immuno-globulins were rarely prescribed. The study confirmed the perceived lack of compliance of clinicians with guideline recommendations for assessing rabies risk. This results in under-estimating the rabies risk in potentially risky exposures in high-rabies-risk areas. Our work underscore the importance of targeted training of female health assistants, doctors, and clinicians in basic health units to improve the management of rabies exposure. In particular there is need to update the national guidelines regarding indications and use of rabies immune-globulins.",

The interactions between climatic conditions and genetic characteristic affect the agricultural performance of soybean. Therefore, an investigation to identify the main elements affecting the agricultural performances of 11 soybeans was conducted in Northeast Asia, China [Harbin (45{degrees}12'N) Yanji (42{degrees}53'N) Dalian (39{degrees}30'N) Qingdao (36{degrees}26'N)] Republic of Korea [Suwon (37{degrees}16'N) and Jeonju (35{degrees}49'N)]. The days to flowering (DTF) of soybeans with the e1-nf and e1-as alleles and the E1e2e3e4 genotype, except Keumgangkong, Tawonkong, and Duyoukong, was relatively short compared to soybeans with other alleles. Although DTF of the soybeans was highly correlated to all climatic conditions, days to maturity (DTM) and 100-seed weight (HSW) of the soybeans showed no significant correlation with any climatic conditions. The soybeans with a dominant Dt1 allele, except Tawonkong, had the longest stem length (STL). Moreover, the STL of the soybeans grown at the test fields showed a positive correlation with only day length (DL) although the results of our chamber test showed that STL of soybean was positively affected by average temperature (AVT) and DL. Soybean yield (YLD) showed positive correlations with latitude and DL (except L62-667, OT89-5, and OT89-6) although the response of YLD to the climatic conditions was cultivar-specific. Our results show that DTF and STL of soybeans grown in Northeast Asia are highly affected by DL although AVT and genetic characteristic also affect DTF and STL. Along with these results, we confirmed that the DTM, HSW, and YLD of the soybeans vary in relation to their genetic characteristic.",

    "abstract": "Synapses grow, prune, and remodel throughout development, experience, and disease. This structural plasticity can destabilize information transfer in the nervous system. However, neural activity remains remarkably stable throughout life, implying that adaptive countermeasures exist to stabilize neurotransmission. Aberrant synaptic structure and function has been associated with a variety of neural diseases including Fragile X syndrome, autism, and intellectual disability. We have screened disruptions in over 300 genes in Drosophila for defects in synaptic growth at the neuromuscular junction. This effort identified 12 mutants with severe reductions or enhancements in synaptic growth. Remarkably, electrophysiological recordings revealed synaptic strength in all but one of these mutants was unchanged compared to wild type. We utilized a combination of genetic, anatomical, and electrophysiological analyses to illuminate three mechanisms that stabilize synaptic strength in the face of alterations in synaptic growth. These include compensatory changes in 1) postsynaptic receptor abundance; 2) presynaptic morphology; and 3) active zone structure. Together, this analysis identifies new genes that regulate synaptic growth and the adaptive strategies that synapses employ to homeostatically stabilize synaptic strength in response.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThroughout development, maturation, experience, and disease, synapses undergo dramatic changes in growth and remodeling. Although these processes are necessary for learning and memory, they pose major challenges to stable function in the nervous system. However, neurotransmission is typically constrained within narrow physiological ranges, implying the existence of homeostatic mechanisms that maintain stable functionality despite drastic alterations in synapse number. In this study we investigate the relationship between synaptic growth and function across a variety of mutations in neural and synaptic genes in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. Using the neuromuscular junction as a model system, we reveal three adaptive mechanisms that stabilize synaptic strength when synapses are dramatically under- or over-grown. Together, these findings provide insights into the strategies employed at both pre- and post-synaptic compartments to ensure stable functionality while allowing considerable flexibility in overall synapse number.",

    "abstract": "IFN{gamma} and IL10 pathways elicit functionally opposing cell fates, however, these two stimuli activate common transcription factors like STAT1 and STAT3 (S/1/3). How the two stimuli regulate the dynamics of S/1/3 activation remains less understood. Here, we experimentally measured the signaling dynamics of S/1/3 in response to IFN{gamma} and IL10 and found that STAT3, in particular, exhibits a bell-shaped response to both stimuli with maximal activation in an intermediate dose. We built a mathematical model, which quantitatively captured the S/1/3 dynamics and by model analysis, we identified the primary regulators controlling the bell-shaped STAT3 responses in both pathways. As the STATs are activated in response to both stimuli, in a scenario when cells are subjected to co-stimulation of IFN{gamma} and IL10, an interpathway competition to activate the common substrate is plausible. Additionally, a strong transcriptional induction of SOCS1 (a negative regulator of IFN{gamma} pathway) was observed upon IL10 stimulation, suggesting that IL10 pathway can potentially inhibit the IFN{gamma} pathway via SOCS1 induction. To quantitatively understand the S/1/3 responses to co-stimulation we next simulated the same which predicted STAT3 activation and SOCS1 induction dynamics would robustly remain IL10 driven. Subsequent experiments validated the model predictions. Further, the model analysis identified the primary regulators controlling the robustness of IL10-STAT3 axis in co-stimulation. Together, our data-driven model quantitatively captured the dynamics of the STATs in response to both pro (IFN{gamma}) and anti (IL10)-inflammatory stimuli and identifies distinct regulatory elements controlling STAT3 signaling in individual and co-stimulation conditions.",

    "abstract": "Early genome-wide association studies (GWAS) led to the surprising discovery that, for typical complex traits, the most significant genetic variants contribute only a small fraction of the estimated heritability. Instead, it has become clear that a huge number of common variants, each with tiny effects, explain most of the heritability. Previously, we argued that these patterns con[fl]ict with standard conceptual models, and that new models are needed. Here we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits can be partitioned into direct effects from core genes, and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting as trans-regulators. We argue that the central importance of peripheral genes is a direct consequence of the large contribution of trans-acting variation to gene expression variation. In particular, we propose that if the core genes for a trait are co-regulated - as seems likely - then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified by these co-regulated networks such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by peripheral genes. Thus our model proposes a framework for understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits.",

To address this challenge, we have developed a method that combines targeted long-read sequencing with short-read based transcriptome profiling of barcoded single cell libraries generated by droplet-based partitioning. We use Repertoire And Gene Expression sequencing (RAGE-seq) to accurately characterize full-length T cell (TCR) and B cell (BCR) receptor sequences and transcriptional profiles of more than 7,138 lymphocytes sampled from the primary tumour and draining lymph node of a breast cancer patient. With this method we show that somatic mutation, alternate splicing and clonal evolution of T and B lymphocytes can be tracked across these tissue compartments.

    "abstract": "BackgroundBariatric surgery is an effective therapeutic procedure for morbidly obese patients as it induces sustained weight loss. The two most common interventions are Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) and Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB).\\n\\nObjectiveCharacterizing the gut microbiota changes induced by LSG and LRYGB.\\n\\nDesign89 and 108 patients who underwent LSG and LRYGB respectively, were recruited from three countries: USA, France and Switzerland. Stools were collected before and 6 months after surgery. Microbial DNA was analysed with shotgun metagenomic sequencing (SOLiD 5500xl Wildfire). MSPminer, a novel innovative tool to characterize new in silico biological entities, was used to identify 715 Metagenomic Species Pan-genome (MSPs). 148 functional modules were analysed using GOmixer and KEGG database.\\n\\nResultsBoth interventions resulted in a similar increase of Shannons diversity index and gene richness of gut microbiota, in parallel with weight loss, but the changes of microbial composition were different. LRYGB led to higher relative abundance of aero-tolerant bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and buccal species, such as Streptococcus and Veillonella spp. In contrast, anaerobes such as Clostridium were more abundant after LSG, suggesting better conservation of anaerobic conditions in the gut. Function-level changes included higher potential for bacterial use of supplements such as vitamin B12, B1 and iron upon LRYGB. Moreover, after LRYGB, potential for nitrate and Trimethylamine oxidized (TMAO) respiration was detected.\\n\\nConclusionMicrobiota changes after bariatric surgery depend on the nature of the intervention. LRYGB induces greater taxonomic and functional changes in gut microbiota than LSG and may lead to a more dysbiotic microbiome. Possible long-term health consequences of these alterations remain to be established.\\n\\nSignificance of this studyO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this subject?C_ST_ABSPrevious studies have reported changes of microbial composition after bariatric surgery with shotgun metagenomics, but lacked statistical power to document the changes. Important shifts in gut microbiome have been observed after LRYGB and LSG with an increase of aerotolerants from buccal microbiota. However, it is not clear how different the changes are between LRYGB and LSG although both procedures induce quite similar results with respect to weight loss, comorbidities remission and global glycaemic improvement outcomes.\\n\\nWhat are the new findings?LSG and LRYGB have specific but different impacts on gut microbial composition 6 months after bariatric surgery. The changes could be related to specific physiological effects. LRYGB promotes an important invasion of oral colonizers with Veillonella and Streptococcus genera. In contrast, these changes were less important after LSG. Moreover, microbial transportation potential of iron and vitamin B12 were also higher after LRYGB than LSG. We concluded that the type of surgery leads to different gut microbiome and functional profiles.\\n\\nHow might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?Microbiome composition and functional profiles are not altered to the same extent by LRYGB and LSG 6 months after surgery. This difference should be considered when advising the patient on the type of bariatric surgery or post op diet.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsLactulose is a common food ingredient and widely used as a treatment for constipation or hepatic encephalopathy and a substrate for hydrogen breath tests. Lactulose is fermented by the colon microbiota resulting in the production of hydrogen (H2). H2 is a substrate for enteropathogens including Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and increased H2 production upon lactulose ingestion might favor the growth of H2-consuming enteropathogens. We aimed to analyze effects of single-dose lactulose ingestion on the growth of intrinsic Escherichia coli (E. coli), which can be efficiently quantified by plating and which share most metabolic requirements with S. Typhimurium.\\n\\nMethods32 healthy volunteers (18 females, 14 males) were recruited. Participants were randomized for single-dose ingestion of 50 g lactulose or 50 g sucrose (controls). After ingestion, H2 in expiratory air and symptoms were recorded. Stool samples were acquired at days -1, 1 and 14. We analyzed 16S microbiota composition and abundance and characteristics of E. coli isolates.\\n\\nResultsLactulose ingestion resulted in diarrhea in 14/17 individuals. In 14/17 individuals, H2-levels in expiratory air increased by [&ge;]20 ppm within 3 hours after lactulose challenge. H2-levels correlated with the number of defecations within 6 hours. E. coli was detectable in feces of all subjects (2 x 102 - 109 CFU/g). However, the number of E. coli colony forming units (CFU) on selective media did not differ between any time point before or after challenge with sucrose or lactulose. The microbiota composition also remained stable upon lactulose exposure.\\n\\nConclusionIngestion of a single dose of 50 g lactulose does not significantly alter E. coli density in stool samples of healthy volunteers. 50 g lactulose therefore seems unlikely to sufficiently alter growth conditions in the intestine for a significant predisposition to infection with H2-consuming enteropathogens such as S. Typhimurium (www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02397512).",

    "abstract": "High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) commonly responds to initial therapy, but this response is rarely durable. Understanding cell fate decisions taken by HGSOC cells in response to treatment could guide new therapeutic opportunities. Here we find that primary HGSOC cultures undergo therapy-induced senescence (TIS) in response to DNA damage induced by chemotherapy. HGSOC-TIS displays most senescence hallmarks including persistent DNA damage, senescence-associated inflammatory secretome, and selective sensitivity to senolytic Bcl-2 family inhibitors, suggesting avenues for preferential synergistic clearance of these cells. Comparison of pre- and post-chemotherapy HGSOC patient tissue samples revealed changes in senescence biomarkers suggestive of post-treatment \\\"in patient\\\" TIS, and a stronger TIS response in post-chemotherapy tissues correlated with better 5-year survival rates for patients.

    "abstract": "Mitotic catastrophe is a broad descriptor encompassing unclear mechanisms of cell death. Here we investigate replication stress-driven mitotic catastrophe in human cells and identify that replication stress principally induces mitotic death signalled through two independent pathways. In p53-compromised cells we find that lethal replication stress confers WAPL-dependent centromere cohesion defects that maintain spindle assembly checkpoint-dependent mitotic arrest in the same cell cycle. Mitotic arrest then drives cohesion fatigue and triggers mitotic death through a primary pathway of BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis. Simultaneously, a secondary mitotic death pathway is engaged through non-canonical telomere deprotection, regulated by TRF2, Aurora B and ATM. Additionally, we find that suppressing mitotic death promotes genome instability in replication stressed cells through diverse mechanisms depending upon how cell death is averted. These data demonstrate how replication stress-induced mitotic catastrophe signals cell death with implications for cancer treatment and genome instability.",

    "abstract": "The parasite Plasmodium falciparum is the main cause of severe malaria (SM). Despite treatment with antimalarial drugs, more than 450,000 SM deaths are reported every year, mainly in African children. The diversity of clinical presentations associated with SM indicate important differences in disease pathogenesis that often require specific treatment, and this clinical heterogeneity of SM is largely unresolved. In this study, we apply new machine learning and inference tools for large-scale data analysis to dissect the heterogeneity in patterns of clinical features associated with SM in 2,695 Gambian children admitted to hospital with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This quantitative analysis, including the powerful HyperTraPS algorithm for inference of progressive processes, reveals pathways of SM symptom progression and features predicting the severity of individual patient outcomes. Notably, our approach allows the identification and dissection of disease progression pathways without the need for longitudinal observations. Learning these pathways and features from this rich dataset allows us to construct several quantitative measures of the mortality risk associated with a patient presenting with a given set of symptoms. By independently surveying expert practitioners, we show that this data-driven approach agrees with and expands the current state of knowledge on malaria progression, while simultaneously providing a data-supported framework for predicting clinical risk.",

We show here that these key functions are shared between B56 isoforms which localise differentially to either the centromere or kinetochore. The centromeric B56 isoforms rely on a specific interaction with Sgo2, whereas the kinetochore isoforms bind preferentially to BubR1 and other proteins containing an LxxIxE motif. The molecular basis for this differential localisation can be mapped to a small C-terminal region in B56 that regulates these key interactions and defines whether PP2A-B56 complexes bind to either the centromere or kinetochore. Together, this study describes how different PP2A-B56 complexes utilise isoform-specific interactions to control distinct processes during mitosis.",

Here we present the antimicrobial resistance profile of HAI-related GNB (HAIrB) isolated from patients (PT), healthcare workers (HCW) and hospital environment (HE) in a six-month screening program. From the 180 sampling points distributed in six hospital units, a total of 1,080 swabs were collected allowing the isolation of 390 HAIrB: 50.5% from HE, 42.6% from PT and 6.9% from HCW. Among the HAIrB, 32.6% were characterized as MDR and 38.7% as extended-spectrum cephalosporins resistant (ESC-R), showing no differences in the distribution between PT, HE and HCW. Carbapenem resistance (CARB-R) was detected for 17.7% of all HAIrB, being higher among Acinetobacter spp. isolates (36.5%), followed by Enterobacteriaceae (14.5%) and Pseudomonas spp. (11.8%). Except for the ICU, that revealed higher MDR, CARB-R and ESC-R rates, HAIrB-resistant profiles were similarly detected within the hospital units. Prevalence of blaKPC-like and blaCTX-M-1 {beta}-lactamases-resistance genes was higher in K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae complex, while blaOXA-23-like and blaSPM-like were higher in A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, respectively. This study reveals that the spreading of HAIrB within a hospital environment is higher than predicted, indicating that healthcare workers, hospital areas and equipment are key players on dissemination of MDR gram-negative bacteria and shows that an active surveillance program can provide precise understanding and direct actions towards control of HAI.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPData on the implementation of laws and policies are essential to the evaluation and improvement of governance. For conservation laws like the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA), such data can inform actions that may determine the persistence or extinction of species. A central but controversial part of the ESA is section 7, which requires federal agencies to conserve threatened and endangered species. One way they do this is by consulting with expert agencies for the ESA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), on actions they may undertake that impact listed species. Using data from all 24,893 consultations recorded by NMFS from 2000 through 2017, we show that federal agencies misestimated the effects of their actions on listed species in 21% of consultations, relative to the conclusions reached by NMFS. In 71% of these cases the federal agency underestimated the effects of their action. Those discrepancies were particularly important for the conservation of 14 species in 22 consultations, where the agency concluded that its action would not harm a species, while NMFS determined the action would jeopardize the species existence. Patterns of misestimation varied among federal agencies, and some of the agencies most frequently involved in consultation also frequently misestimated their effects. Jeopardy conclusions were very rare--about 0.3% of consultations--with a few project types more likely to lead to jeopardy. These data highlight the importance of consultation with the expert agencies and reveal opportunities to make the consultation process more effective.\\n\\nSO_SCPCAPIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTC_SCPCAPThe US Endangered Species Act is the strongest environmental law any nation has enacted to conserve imperiled species. However, policy debates over how the Act should be implemented continue to this day. This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of how the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) implements one of the Acts most important conservation programs - consultations under section 7. Our results reveal novel insights into the importance of NMFS role in ensuring federal actions do not jeopardize the existence of listed species. By using data to inform policy debate, we identify approaches to implementing section 7 that would undermine the conservation of imperiled species, and those that could improve the efficiency of the program without sacrificing these protections.",

    "abstract": "There is growing theoretical evidence that spatial structure can affect the ecological and evolutionary outcomes of host-parasite interactions. Locally restricted interactions have been shown in particular to affect host resistance and tolerance. In this study we investigate the evolution of several types of host disease resistance strategies, alone or in combination, in spatially structured populations. We construct a spatially explicit, individual-based stochastic model where hosts and parasites interact with each other in a spatial lattice, and interactions are restricted to a given neighbourhood of varying size. We investigate several host resistance strategies, including constitutive (expressed in all resistant hosts), induced (expressed only upon infection), and combinations thereof. We show that the specific resistance mechanism against a pathogen as well as the size of the neighbourhood both affect resistance spread and parasite dynamics, an effect modulated by the level of the cost of resistance. Our results shed new light on the dynamics of disease resistance in a spatially-structured host-pathogen system, and illustrate the conditions in which a variety of resistance mechanisms can be maintained, including when they are costly. Overall these results advance our theoretical understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of disease resistance, a necessary step to elaborate more efficient and sustainable strategies for disease management.",

However, often context too is ambiguous, and thus it should be inferred itself to guide behavior. We developed a novel hierarchical task where participants should infer a higher-level, contextual variable to inform probabilistic inference about a hidden dependent variable at a lower level. By controlling the reliability of the past sensory evidence through sample size, we found that humans estimate the reliability of the context and combine it with current sensory uncertainty to inform their confidence reports. Indeed, behavior closely follows inference by probabilistic message passing between latent variables across hierarchical state representations. Despite the sophistication of our task, commonly reported inferential fallacies, such as sample size insensitivity, are not present, and neither do participants appear to rely on simple heuristics. Our results reveal ubiquitous probabilistic representations of uncertainty at different hierarchical levels and temporal scales of the environment.",

Responses to facial cues of strength are therefore thought to play an important role in human social interaction. Although many researchers have proposed that sexually dimorphic facial morphology is reliably correlated with physical strength, evidence for this hypothesis is somewhat mixed. Moreover, to date, only one study has investigated the putative relationship between facial masculinity and physical strength in women. Consequently, we tested for correlations between handgrip strength and objective measures of face-shape masculinity.\\n\\nMethods531 women took part in the study. We measured each participants handgrip strength (dominant hand). Sexual dimorphism of face shape was objectively measured from each face photograph using two methods: discriminant analysis and vector analysis. These methods use shape components derived from principal component analyses of facial landmarks to measure the probability of the face being classified as male (discriminant analysis method) or to locate the face on a female-male continuum (vector analysis method).\\n\\nResultsOur analyses revealed that handgrip strength is, at best, only weakly correlated with facial masculinity in women. There was a weak significant association between handgrip strength and one measure of womens facial masculinity. The relationship between handgrip strength and our other measure of womens facial masculinity was not significant.\\n\\nDiscussionTogether, these results do not support the hypothesis that face-shape masculinity is an important cue of physical strength, at least in women.",

In this study, we provide some general guidelines on the design, analysis and application of MCTs. We first established empirical quantitative relationships between mouse number and measurement accuracy for both categorical and continuous efficacy endpoints, and showed that more mice are needed to achieve given accuracy for syngeneic models than for PDXs and CDXs. There is considerable disagreement between categorical methods on calling drug responses as objective response, indicating limitations of such approaches. We then introduced linear mixed models, or LMMs, to describe MCTs as clustered longitudinal studies, which explicitly model growth and drug response heterogeneities across mouse models and among mice within a mouse model. Several case studies were used to demonstrate the advantages of LMMs in discovering biomarkers and exploring a drugs mechanism of action. We also introduced the additive frailty models to perform survival analysis on MCTs, which more accurately estimate hazard ratios by modeling the clustered population structures in MCTs. We performed computational simulations for LMMs and frailty models to generate statistical power curves, and showed that statistical power is close for designs with similar total number of mice at given drug efficacy. Finally, we explained how MCTs can explain discrepant results in clinical trials, hence, MCTs are more than preclinical versions of clinical trials but possess their unique values. Results in the report will make MCTs a better tool for oncology drug development.",

    "abstract": "The fossil record constitutes the primary source of information about the evolutionary history of extant and extinct groups, and many analyses of macroevolution rely on fossils that are accurately placed within phylogenies. To avoid misinterpretation of the fossil record, especially by non-palaeontologists, the proper assessment and communication of uncertainty in fossil placement is crucial. We here use Bayesian morphological phylogenetics to evaluate the classifications of fossil parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae) and introduce  RoguePlots to illustrate placement uncertainty on the phylogeny of extant taxa. Based on an extensive, newly constructed morphological matrix of 222 characters in 24 fossil and 103 extant taxa, we test three different aspects of models of morphological evolution. We find that a model that includes ordered characters, among-character rate variation, and a state-space restricted to observed states achieves the highest marginal likelihoods. The individual RoguePlots reveal large differences in confidence in the placement of the different fossils and allow some refinements to their classification: Polyhelictes bipolarus and Ichninsum appendicrassum are moved from an uncertain subfamily placement to Pimplinae, Plectiscidea lanhami is transferred to Allomacrus in Cylloceriinae (Allomacrus lanhami, comb. nov.), Lithotorus cressoni is moved from Diplazontinae to Orthocentrinae, and we note uncertainty in the generic placement of Xanthopimpla? messelensis. We discuss potential artefacts that might result in biased posterior probabilities in Bayesian morphological phylogenetic analyses, pertaining to character and taxon sampling, fossilization biases, and model misspecification. Finally, we suggest future directions both in ichneumonid palaeontology, in the modelling of morphological evolution, and in the way Bayesian phylogenetics can improve both assessment and representation of fossil placement uncertainty.",

While whole-tissue metabolite profiling has been useful for studying metabolism in vivo, such an approach lacks resolution at the cellular and subcellular level. In vivo methods for interrogating organellar metabolites in specific cell-types within mammalian tissues have been limited. To address this, we built on prior work in which we exploited a mitochondrially-localized 3XHA epitope-tag (\\\"MITO-Tag\\\") for the fast isolation of mitochondria from cultured cells to now generate \\\"MITO-Tag Mice.\\\" Affording spatiotemporal control over MITO-Tag expression, these transgenic animals enable the rapid, cell-type-specific immunoisolation of mitochondria from tissues, which we verified using a combination of proteomic and metabolomic approaches. Using MITO-Tag Mice and targeted and untargeted metabolite profiling, we identified changes during fasted and refed conditions in a diverse array of mitochondrial metabolites in hepatocytes and found metabolites that behaved differently at the mitochondrial versus whole-tissue level. MITO-Tag Mice should have utility for studying mitochondrial physiology and our strategy should be generally applicable for studying other mammalian organelles in specific cell-types in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge integration based on the relationship between structure and function of the neural substrate is one of the main targets of neuroinformatics and data-driven computational modeling. However, the multiplicity of data sources, the diversity of benchmarks, the mixing of observables of different natures, and the necessity of a long-term, systematic approach make such a task challenging. Here we present a first snapshot of a long-term integrative modeling program designed to address this issue: a comprehensive spiking model of cat primary visual cortex satisfying an unprecedented range of anatomical, statistical and functional constraints under a wide range of visual input statistics. In the presence of physiological levels of tonic stochastic bombardment by spontaneous thalamic activity, the modeled cortical reverberations self-generate a sparse asynchronous ongoing activity that quantitatively matches a range of experimentally measured statistics. When integrating feed-forward drive elicited by a high diversity of visual contexts, the simulated network produces a realistic, quantitatively accurate interplay between visually evoked excitatory and inhibitory conductances; contrast-invariant orientation-tuning width; center surround interactions; and stimulus-dependent changes in the precision of the neural code. This integrative model offers numerous insights into how the studied properties interact, contributing to a better understanding of visual cortical dynamics. It provides a basis for future development towards a comprehensive model of low-level perception.\n\nSignificance statementComputational modeling can integrate fragments of understanding generated by experimental neuroscience. However, most previous models considered only a few features of neural computation at a time, leading to either poorly constrained models with many parameters, or lack of expressiveness in over-simplified models. A solution is to commit to detailed models, but constrain them with a broad range of anatomical and functional data. This requires a long-term systematic approach. Here we present a first snapshot of such an integrative program: a large-scale spiking model of V1, that is constrained by an unprecedented range of anatomical and functional features. Together with the associated modeling infrastructure, this study lays the groundwork for a broad integrative modeling program seeking an in-depth understanding of vision.",

    "abstract": "Lineage-restricted transcription factors, such as the intestine-specifying factor CDX2, often have dual requirements across developmental time. Embryonic-loss of CDX2 triggers homeotic transformation of intestinal fate, while adult-onset Cdx2-loss compromises critical physiological functions but preserves intestinal identity. It is unclear how such diverse requirements are executed across the developmental continuum. Using primary and engineered human tissues, mouse genetics, and a multi-omics approach, we demonstrate that divergent CDX2 loss-of-function phenotypes in embryonic versus adult intestines correspond to divergent CDX2 chromatin-binding profiles in embryonic versus adult stages. CDX2 binds and activates distinct target genes in developing versus adult mouse and human intestinal cells. We find that temporal shifts in chromatin accessibility correspond to these context-specific CDX2 activities. Thus, CDX2 is not sufficient to activate a mature intestinal program, but rather, CDX2 responds to its environment, targeting stage-specific genes to contribute to either intestinal patterning or maturity. This study provides insights into the mechanisms through which lineage-specific regulatory factors achieve divergent functions over developmental time.",

    "abstract": "Insect pests strongly affect the productivity and profitability of agriculture and forestry. Despite the well-known sensitivity of insects to abiotic effects such as temperature, their potential responses to ongoing climate change remain unclear. Here we compile and review documented climate change responses of 31 of the globally most impactful phytophagous insect pests, focussing on species for which long-term, high-quality data are available. Most of the selected species show at least one response affecting their severity as pests, including changes in geographic range, population dynamics, life-history traits, and/or trophic interactions. Of the studied pests, 41% only show responses that are linked to increased pest severity, 4% only show responses of decreased severity, whereas importantly 55%, the majority of studied pests, show mixed responses including both increased and decreased severity under ongoing climate change. Variability in impact is further supported by a thermal sensitivity analysis showing little benefit of climate warming in relation to the optimal developmental temperatures for the majority of these pests under both current climate and future projections. Overall the results show that calculating the net effect of climate change on phytophagous insect pest impact is far from straightforward. The documented variation in responses, e.g. between agricultural and forest pests, indicates that efforts to mitigate undesirable climate change effects must target individual species, taking into account the complex ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underlying their responses.",

    "abstract": "Shifts from outcrossing to self-fertilisation have occurred repeatedly in many different lineages of flowering plants, and often involve the breakdown of genetic outcrossing mechanisms. In the Brassicaceae, self-incompatibility (SI) allows plants to ensure outcrossing by recognition and rejection of self-pollen on the stigma. This occurs through the interaction of female and male specificity components, consisting of a pistil based receptor and a pollen-coat protein, both of which are encoded by tightly linked genes at the S-locus. When benefits of selfing are higher than costs of inbreeding, theory predicts that loss-of-function mutations in the male (pollen) SI component should be favoured, especially if they are dominant. However, it remains unclear whether mutations in the male component of SI are predominantly responsible for shifts to self-compatibility, and testing this prediction has been difficult due to the challenges of sequencing the highly polymorphic and repetitive ~100 kbp S-locus. The crucifer genus Capsella offers an excellent opportunity to study multiple transitions from outcrossing to self-fertilization, but so far, little is known about the genetic basis and timing of loss of SI in the self-fertilizing diploid Capsella orientalis. Here, we show that loss of SI in C. orientalis occurred within the past 2.6 Mya and maps as a dominant trait to the S-locus. Using targeted long-read sequencing of multiple complete S-haplotypes, we identify a frameshift deletion in the male specificity gene SCR that is fixed in C. orientalis, and we confirm loss of male SI specificity. We further analyze RNA sequencing data to identify a conserved, S-linked small RNA (sRNA) that is predicted to cause dominance of self-compatibility. Our results suggest that degeneration of pollen SI specificity in dominant S-alleles is important for shifts to self-fertilization in the Brassicaceae.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAlready Darwin was fascinated by the widely varying modes of plant reproduction. The shift from outcrossing to self-fertilization is considered one of the most frequent evolutionary transitions in flowering plants, yet we still know little about the genetic basis of these shifts. In the Brassicaceae, outcrossing is enforced by a self-incompatibility (SI) system that enables the recognition and rejection of self pollen. This occurs through the action of two tightly linked genes at the S-locus, that encode a receptor protein located on the stigma (female component) and a pollen ligand protein (male component), respectively. Nevertheless, SI has frequently been lost, and theory predicts that mutations in the male component should have an advantage during the loss of SI, especially if they are dominant. To test this hypothesis, we mapped the loss of SI in a selfing species from the genus Capsella, a model system for evolutionary genomics. We found that loss of SI mapped to the S-locus, which harbored a dominant loss-of-function mutation in the male SI protein, and as expected, we found that male specificity was indeed lost in C. orientalis. Our results suggest that transitions to selfing often involve parallel genetic changes.",

    "abstract": "There is a vast gulf between the two primary strategies for simulating protein-ligand interactions. Docking methods significantly limit or eliminate protein flexibility to gain great speed at the price of uncontrolled inaccuracy, whereas fully flexible atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are expensive and often suffer from limited sampling. We have developed a flexible docking approach geared especially for highly flexible or poorly resolved targets based on mixed-resolution Monte Carlo (MRMC), which is intended to offer a balance among speed, protein flexibility, and sampling power. The binding region of the protein is treated with a standard atomistic force field, while the remainder of the protein is modeled at the residue level with a G[o] model that permits protein flexibility while saving computational cost. Implicit solvation is used. Here we assess three facets of the MRMC approach with implications for other docking studies: (i) the role of receptor flexibility in cross-docking pose prediction; (ii) the use of non-equilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) and (iii) the use of pose-clustering in scoring. We examine 61 co-crystallized ligands of estrogen receptor , an important cancer target known for its flexibility. We also compare the performance of the MRMC approach with Autodock smina, a docking program. [1] Adding protein flexibility, not surprisingly, leads to significantly lower total energies and stronger interactions between protein and ligand, but notably we document the important role of backbone flexibility in the improvement. The improved backbone flexibility also leads to improved performance relative to smina. Somewhat unexpectedly, our implementation of NCMC leads to only modestly improved sampling of ligand poses. Overall, the addition of protein flexibility improves the performance of docking, as measured by energy-ranked poses, but we do not find significant improvements based on cluster information or the use of NCMC.",

    "abstract": "MYCN is a transcription factor that is aberrantly expressed in many tumor types and is often correlated with poor patient prognosis. Recently, several lines of evidence pointed to the fact that oncogenic activation of MYC family proteins is concomitant with reprogramming of tumor cells to cope with an enhanced need for metabolites during cell growth. These adaptions are driven by the ability of MYC proteins to act as transcriptional amplifiers in a tissue-of-origin specific manner. Here, we describe the effects of MYCN overexpression on metabolic reprogramming in neuroblastoma cells. Ectopic expression of MYCN induced a glycolytic switch that was concomitant with enhanced sensitivity towards 2-deoxyglucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis. Moreover, global metabolic profiling revealed extensive alterations in the cellular metabolome resulting from overexpression of MYCN. Limited supply with either of the two main carbon sources, glucose or glutamine, resulted in distinct shifts in steady-state metabolite levels and significant changes in glutathione metabolism. Interestingly, interference with glutamine-glutamate conversion preferentially blocked proliferation of MYCN overexpressing cells, when glutamine levels were reduced. Thus, our study uncovered MYCN induction and nutrient levels as important metabolic master switches in neuroblastoma cells and identified critical nodes that restrict tumor cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Finding the correct place of the root of the Placentalia tree of life is an unsolved problem in mammalian systematics. Three major competing hypotheses were proposed, alternating the position of the supraordinal taxa Afrotheria, Xenarthra, or Atlantogenata as sister lineages to the remaining placentals. While all three phylogenetic associations were inferred by studies conducted so far, recent assessments applying heterogeneous models and coalescent-based phylogenetic methods found robust support for the Atlantogenata hypothesis. Current developments in theoretical phylogenetics, such as the demonstration that concatenating genes may bias the likelihood function, and that summary coalescent-based phylogenetic methods are sensitive to errors in gene tree estimation, calls for a reevaluation of the early placental split problem. We investigated the phylogenetic relationships between placental superorders by restricting the analysis to subsets of genes with unequivocal phylogenetic signal. In contrast to previous works, we show that the hypothesis of a polytomy at the placental root could not be rejected under the multispecies coalescent model. This result endorses conclusions from analyses of retroposon insertion patterns. We provide an analytical framework to access empirical polytomies employing summary coalescent methods and topological tests, helping the investigation of poorly resolved nodes in the tree of life.",

    "abstract": "Microbes are the most diverse organisms on Earth. Sequencing their DNA suggests thousands of different microbes could be present in a single sample. Errors in sequencing, however, make it challenging to estimate exactly how diverse microbes are. Here we developed a tool that estimates diversity accurately, even in the presence of sequencing errors. We first evaluated two existing tools, DADA2 and Deblur, which work by correcting sequencing errors. We found that these tools estimated within-sample (alpha) diversity poorly. In fact, we obtained better estimates if did not use the tools at all (left errors uncorrected). These tools performed poorly because they changed the relative abundance of different sequences; this is a side effect of correcting errors and discarding up to 90% of sequence reads in the process. Previous evaluations ignored sequence abundance when calculating diversity, overlooking this problem. Our tool, Distanced, differs from existing tools because it does not correct sequencing errors. Instead, it corrects sequence distances, which are used to calculate diversity. It does this correction with Phred quality scores and Bayes theorem. No sequence reads are discarded in the process. In our evaluation, Distanced accurately estimated diversity of bacterial DNA, fungal DNA, and even antibody mRNA. Given its accuracy, Distanced will help investigators answer important questions about microbial diversity. For example, it could answer how important is diversity for the planets ecosystems and human health.",

    "abstract": "Studies of metacognition often measure confidence in perceptual decisions. Much less is known about metacognition of action, and specifically about how people estimate the success of their own actions. In the present study, we compare metacognitive abilities between voluntary actions, passive movements matched to those actions, and purely visual signals. Participants reported their confidence in judging whether a brief visual probe appeared ahead or behind of their finger during simple flexion/extension movement. The finger could be moved voluntarily, or could be moved passively by a robot replaying their own previous movements. In a third condition, participants did not move, but a visual cursor replayed their previous voluntary movements. Metacognitive sensitivity was comparable when judging active movements, during passive finger displacement and visual cursor reply. However, a progressive metacognitive bias towards overconfidence was found for passive and for voluntary movements. Taken together, our results may partly explain some of the peculiarities that arise when one judges ones own actions.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive abilities can vary dramatically among species though little is known about the dynamics of cognitive evolution. Here we demonstrate that recent evolution of visual individual recognition in the paper wasp Polistes fuscatus is the target of arguably the strongest positive selective pressure in the species recent history. The most extreme selective sweeps in P. fuscatus are associated with genes known to be involved in long-term memory formation, mushroom body development and visual processing - all traits that have recently evolved in association with individual recognition. Cognitive evolution appears to have been driven initially by selection on standing variation in perceptual traits followed by both hard and soft sweeps on learning and memory. Evolutionary modeling reveals that intense selection as observed in P. fuscatus is likely the norm during the early stages of cognitive evolution. These data provide insight into the dynamics of cognition evolution demonstrating that social selection for increased intelligence can lead to rapid multi-genic adaptation of enhanced recognition abilities.",

In order to improve genetic research, diagnostics and counseling, there is a need for an evidence-based overview of the currently known genes.\\n\\nStudy design, size, durationWe performed a systematic literature search and evidence assessment for all publications in Pubmed until June 2018 covering genetic causes of male infertility and/or defective male genitourinary development.\\n\\nParticipants/materials, setting, methodsTwo independent reviewers conducted the literature search and included papers on the monogenic causes of human male infertility and excluded papers on genetic association or risk factors, karyotype anomalies and/or copy number variations affecting multiple genes. Next, the quality and the extent of all evidence supporting selected genes was weighed by a standardized scoring method and used to determine the clinical validity of each gene-disease relationship as expressed by the following six categories: no evidence, limited, moderate, strong, definitive or unable to classify.\\n\\nMain results and the role of chanceFrom a total of 23,031 records, we included 1,286 publications about monogenic causes of male infertility leading to a list of 471 gene-disease relationships. The clinical validity of these gene-disease relationships varied widely and ranged from definitive (n=36) to strong (n=12), moderate (n=33), limited (n=86) or no evidence (n=154). A total of 150 gene-disease relationships could not be classified.\\n\\nLimitations, reasons for cautionOur literature search was limited to Pubmed.\\n\\nWider implications of the findingsThe comprehensive overview will aid researchers and clinicians in the field to establish gene lists for diagnostic screening using validated gene-disease criteria and identify gaps in our knowledge of male infertility.

The results show that the photosynthetic capacity of Pecan and Hickory plants was not limited when the leaves had potassium concentrations >1.4% and 1.42% of dry weight. Most of limitation under potassium deficiency were dominated by MCL for Pecan and Hickory. Both cultivars showed remarkable improvement in SL, MCL, J and Vc,max with additional K supplies. However, effect from potassium deficiency on photosynthesis in plant leaves was irreversible. All of SL, MCL, and BL nearly half down with recovery K supply in both species.

    "abstract": "Bacterial cells are critically dependent upon pH regulation. Most proteins function over a limited pH range and the pH gradient across the bacterial cell membrane is central to energy production and transduction1. Here we demonstrate that indole plays a critical role in the regulation of the cytoplasmic pH of E. coli. Indole is an aromatic molecule with diverse signalling roles that in bacteria is produced from tryptophan by the enzyme tryptophanase (TnaA)2. Two modes of indole signalling have been described: persistent and pulse signalling. The latter is illustrated by the brief but intense elevation of intracellular indole during stationary phase entry3,4. We show that E. coli cells growing under conditions where no indole is produced maintain their cytoplasmic pH at 7.8 {+/-} 0.2. In contrast, under conditions permitting indole production, pH is maintained at 7.2 {+/-} 0.2. Experiments where indole was added experimentally to non-producing cultures showed that pH regulation results from pulse, rather than persistent, indole signalling. Furthermore, the application of an artificial pulse of either of two non-biological proton ionophores (DNP or CCCP) caused a similar effect, suggesting that the relevant property of indole in this context is its ability to conduct protons across the cytoplasmic membrane5. Additionally, we show that the effect of the indole pulse that occurs normally during stationary phase entry in rich medium remains as a \\\"memory\\\" to maintain the correct cytoplasmic pH until entry into the next stationary phase. The indole-mediated reduction in cytoplasmic pH may explain why indole provides E. coli with a degree of protection against stresses, including some bactericidal antibiotics.",

While working memory engages dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), few studies have investigated whether these subfunctions are localized to different cortical depths in this region, and none have done so in humans. Here, we use high-resolution functional MRI to interrogate the layer specificity of neural activity during different epochs of a working memory task in dlPFC. We detect activity timecourses that follow the hypothesized patterns: superficial layers are preferentially active during the delay period, while deeper layers are preferentially active during the response. Results demonstrate that layer-specific fMRI can be used in higher-order brain regions to non-invasively map cognitive information processing along cortical circuitry in humans.",

Here we unveil mouse ANKRD31 as a lynchpin governing multiple aspects of DSB formation. Spermatocytes lacking ANKRD31 have altered DSB locations and fail to target DSBs to sex chromosomes pseudoautosomal regions (PAR). They also have delayed/fewer recombination sites but, paradoxically, more DSBs, suggesting DSB dysregulation. Unrepaired DSBs and pairing failures--stochastic on autosomes, nearly absolute on X and Y--cause meiotic arrest and sterility in males. Ankrd31-deficient females have reduced oocyte reserves. A crystal structure defines direct ANKRD31- REC114 molecular contacts and reveals a surprising pleckstrin homology domain in REC114. In vivo, ANKRD31 stabilizes REC114 association with the PAR and elsewhere. Our findings inform a model that ANKRD31 is a scaffold anchoring REC114 and other factors to specific genomic locations, promoting efficient and timely DSB formation but possibly also suppressing formation of clustered DSBs.",

Recently, research has shifted its focus from the global symmetry of grid cell activity to local distortions both in space and time, such as drifts in orientation, local defects of the hexagonal symmetry, and the decay and reappearance of grid patterns after changes in lighting condition. Here, we introduce a method that allows to visualize and quantify such local distortions, by assigning both a local grid score and a local orientation to each individual spike of a neuronal recording. The score is inspired by a standard measure from crystallography, which has been introduced to quantify local order in crystals. By averaging over spikes recorded within arbitrary regions or time periods, we can quantify local variations in symmetry and orientation of firing patterns in both space and time.",

    "abstract": "Citrullination, the deimination of arginine residues into citrulline, has been implicated in the aetiology of several diseases. In multiple sclerosis (MS), citrullination is thought to be a major driver of pathology, through hypercitrullination and destabilization of myelin. As such, inhibition of citrullination has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy for MS. Here, in contrast, we show citrullination by peptidylarginine deiminase 2 (PADI2) is required for normal oligodendrocyte differentiation, myelination and motor function. We identify several targets for PADI2, including myelin-related proteins and chromatin-associated proteins, implicating PADI2 in epigenetic regulation. Accordingly, we observe that PADI2 inhibition and its knockdown affect chromatin accessibility and prevent the upregulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation genes. Moreover, mice lacking PADI2, display motor dysfunction and decreased number of myelinated axons in the corpus callosum. We conclude that citrullination is required for oligodendrocyte lineage progression and myelination and suggest its targeted activation in the oligodendrocyte lineage might be beneficial in the context of remyelination.",

    "abstract": "VEGFA signaling is crucial for physiological and pathological angiogenesis and hematopoiesis. Although many context-dependent signaling pathways downstream of VEGFA have been uncovered, vegfa transcriptional regulation in vivo remains unclear. Here we show that the ETS transcription factor, Etv6, positively regulates vegfa expression during Xenopus blood stem cell development through multiple transcriptional inputs. In agreement with its established repressive functions, Etv6 directly inhibits the expression of the vegfa repressor, foxo3. Surprisingly, it also directly activates the expression of the vegfa activator, klf4. Finally, it indirectly binds to the vegfa promoter where it co-localizes with Klf4. Klf4 deficiency downregulates vegfa expression and significantly decreases Etv6 binding to the vegfa promoter, indicating that Klf4 recruits Etv6 to the vegfa promoter. Thus, our work uncovers a dual function for Etv6, as both a transcriptional repressor and activator, in controlling a major signaling pathway involved in blood and endothelial development in vivo. Given the established relationships between development and cancer, this elaborate gene regulatory network may inform new strategies for the treatment of VEGFA-dependent tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) enables many important metabolic reactions, like ATP generation and redox balance. While the vital importance of mitochondrial function is obvious, the cellular response to defects in mitochondria and in particular the modulation of signalling pathway outputs is not understood. Using the Drosophila eye as model, we show that the combination of Notch signalling and a mild attenuation of the ETC via knock-down of COX7a causes massive cellular over-proliferation. The tumour like growth is caused by a transcriptional response through the eIF2-kinase PERK and ATF4, a stress-induced transcription factor, which activates the expression of many metabolic enzymes, nutrient transporters and mitochondrial chaperones. We find this stress adaptation to be beneficial for progenitor cell fitness upon ETC attenuation. Activation of the ATF4 mediated stress response renders cells sensitive to proliferation induced by the growth-promoting Notch or Ras signalling pathways, leading to severe tissue over-growth. In sum, our results suggest ETC function is monitored by the PERK-ATF4 pathway, a cellular adaptation hijacked by growth-promoting signalling pathways in situations of oncogenic pathway activity.",
