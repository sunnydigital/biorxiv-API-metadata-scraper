    "abstract": "Enteric viruses, including poliovirus, are spread by the fecal-oral route. In order to persist and transmit to a new host, enteric virus particles must remain stable once they are in the environment. Environmental stressors such as heat and disinfectants can inactivate virus particles and prevent viral transmission. It has been previously demonstrated that bacteria or bacterial surface glycans can enhance poliovirus virion stability and limit inactivation from heat or bleach. While investigating the mechanisms underlying bacterial-enhanced virion thermal stability, we identified and characterized a poliovirus mutant with increased resistance to heat inactivation. This poliovirus mutant, M132V, harbors a single amino acid change in the VP1 capsid-coding that is sufficient to confer heat resistance. M132V was comparable to wild-type virus for replication in vitro, as well as for replication and pathogenesis in orally-inoculated mice. Although the M132V virus was stable in the absence of bacteria or feces at most temperatures, M132V virus was stabilized by feces at very high temperatures. Additionally, the M132V virus does not have enhanced stability during bleach treatment, suggesting that thermal and bleach inactivation mechanisms are separable. Our results suggest that different mechanisms underlie virion stabilization by bacteria and the M132V mutation. Overall, this work sheds light on factors that influence virion stability.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEViruses spread by the fecal-oral route need to maintain viability in the environment to ensure transmission. Previous work indicated that bacteria and bacterial surface polysaccharides can stabilize viral particles and enhance transmission. To explore factors that influence viral particle stability, we isolated a mutant poliovirus that is heat resistant. This mutant virus does not require feces for stability at most temperatures, but can be stabilized by feces at very high temperatures. Even though the mutant virus is heat resistant, it is susceptible to inactivation by treatment with bleach. This work provides insight into how viral particles maintain infectivity in the environment.",

    "abstract": "Locomotion is essential for an animals survival. This behavior can range from directional changes to adapting the motor force to the conditions of its surroundings. Even if speed and force of movement are changing, the relative coordination between the limbs or body segments has to stay stable in order to provide the necessary thrust. The coordinating information necessary for this task is not always conveyed by sensory pathways. Adaptation is well studied in sensory neurons, but only few studies have addressed if and how coordinating information changes in cases where a local circuit within the central nervous system is responsible for the coordination between body segments at different locomotor activity states.\\n\\nOne system that does not depend on sensory information to coordinate a chain of coupled oscillators is the swimmeret system of crayfish. Here, the coordination of four coupled CPGs is controlled by central Coordinating Neurons. Cycle by cycle, the Coordinating Neurons encode information about the activity state of their home ganglion as burst of spikes, and send it as corollary discharge to the neighboring ganglia. Activity states, or excitation levels, are variable in both the living animal and isolated nervous system; yet the amount of coordinating spikes per burst is limited.\\n\\nHere, we demonstrate that the systems excitation level tunes the encoding properties of the Coordinating Neurons. Their ability to adapt to excitation level, and thus encode relative changes in their home ganglions activity states, is mediated by a balancing mechanism. Manipulation of cholinergic pathways directly affected the coordinating neurons electrophysiological properties. Yet, these changes were counteracted by the networks influence. This balancing may be one feature to adapt the limited spike range to the systems current activity state.",

    "abstract": "The lateral portion of the entorhinal cortex is one of the first brain regions affected by tau pathology, an important biomarker for Alzheimers disease (AD). Improving our understanding of this regions cognitive role may help identify better cognitive tests for early detection of AD. Based on its functional connections, we tested the idea that the human anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alERC) may play a role in integrating spatial information into object representations. We recently demonstrated that the volume of the alERC was related to processing the spatial relationships of the features within an object (Yeung et al., 2017). In the present study, we investigated whether the human alERC might also play a role in processing the spatial relationships between an object and its environment using an eyetracking task that assessed visual fixations to a critical object within a scene. Guided by rodent work, we measured both object-in-place memory, the association of an object with a given context (Wilson et al., 2013), and object-trace memory, the memory for the former location of objects (Tsao, Moser, & Moser, 2013). In a group of older adults with varying stages of brain atrophy and cognitive decline, we found that the volume of the alERC and the volume of the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) selectively predicted object-in-place memory, but not object-trace memory. These results provide support for the notion that the alERC may integrate spatial information into object representations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSomatic copy number alternation (SCNA) is a common feature of the cancer genome and is associated with cancer etiology and prognosis. The allele-specific SCNA analysis of a tumor sample aims to identify the allele-specific copy numbers of both alleles, adjusting for the ploidy and the tumor purity. Next generation sequencing platforms produce abundant read counts at the base-pair resolution across the exome or whole genome which is susceptible to hypersegmentation, a phenomenon where numerous regions with very short length are falsely identified as SCNA.\\n\\nResultsWe propose hsegHMM, a hidden Markov model approach that accounts for hypersegmentation for allele-specific SCNA analysis. hsegHMM provides statistical inference of copy number profiles by using an effcient E-M algorithm procedure. Through simulation and application studies, we found that hsegHMM handles hypersegmentation effectively with a t-distribution as a part of the emission probability distribution structure and a carefully defined state space. We also compared hsegHMM with FACETS which is a current method for allele-specific SCNA analysis. For the application, we use a renal cell carcinoma sample from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) study.\\n\\nConclusionsWe demonstrate the robustness of hsegHMM to hypersegmentation. Furthermore, hsegHMM provides the quantification of uncertainty in identifying allele-specific SCNAs over the entire chromosomes. hsegHMM performs better than FACETS when read depth (coverage) is uneven across the genome.",

We reformulate Shimatani model of replicated Neyman-Scott process to allow for a general dispersal kernel function and we show that the random immigration hypothesis can be substituted by the long dispersal distance property of the kernel. Moreover, the extended framework presented here is fit to handle spatially explicit statistical estimators of genetic variability like Moran autocorrelation index, Sorensen similarity index, average kinship coefficient. We discuss the pivotal role of the choice of dispersal kernel for the above estimators in a toy model of dynamic population genetics theory.",

    "abstract": "The curse of dimensionality plagues models of reinforcement learning and decision-making. The process of abstraction solves this by constructing abstract variables describing features shared by different specific instances, reducing dimensionality and enabling generalization in novel situations. Here we characterized neural representations in monkeys performing a task where a hidden variable described the temporal statistics of stimulus-response-outcome mappings. Abstraction was defined operationally using the generalization performance of neural decoders across task conditions not used for training. This type of generalization requires a particular geometric format of neural representations. Neural ensembles in dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus, and in simulated neural networks, simultaneously represented multiple hidden and explicit variables in a format reflecting abstraction. Task events engaging cognitive operations modulated this format. These findings elucidate how the brain and artificial systems represent abstract variables, variables critical for generalization that in turn confers cognitive flexibility.",

    "abstract": "In many social mammals, social adversity predicts compromised health and reduced fitness. These effects are thought to be driven in part by chronic social stress, but their molecular underpinnings are not well understood. Recent work suggests that chronic stress can affect mitochondrial copy number, heteroplasmy rates, and function. Here, we tested the first two possibilities, for the first time in nonhuman primates. We manipulated dominance rank in captive female rhesus macaques (n=45), where low rank induces chronic social stress, and measured mitochondrial DNA copy number and heteroplasmy in five peripheral blood mononuclear cell types from each study subject. We found no effect of dominance rank on either mtDNA copy number or heteroplasmy rates. However, grooming rates, a measure of affiliative social behavior predicted by high social status, was positively associated with mtDNA copy number in B cells, cytotoxic T cells, and monocytes. Our results suggest that social interactions can influence mtDNA regulation in immune cells. Further, they indicate the importance of considering both affiliative and competitive interactions in investigating this relationship.",

    "abstract": "The persistence of several warning signals in sympatry is a puzzling evolutionary question because selection favours convergence of colour patterns among toxic species. Such convergence is shaped by predators reaction to similar but not identical stimulus, i.e. generalisation behaviour. However, studying generalisation behaviour in complex natural communities of predators is challenging, and is thus generally limited to simple variations of prey colour patterns. Here, we used humans as surrogate predators to investigate generalisation behaviours on two prey communities with different level of warning signals complexity. Humans generalisation capacities were estimated using a computer game simulating a simple (4 morphs) and a complex (10 morphs) community of defended (associated with a penalty) and palatable butterflies. Colour patterns used in the game are actually observed in natural populations of the defended butterflies H. numata, and generalisation behaviour of natural predators communities on these colour patterns have previously been investigated in the wild, allowing direct comparison with human behaviour. We investigated human predation behaviour by recording attack rates on the different defended and palatable colour patterns, as well as player survival time (i.e. score). Phenotypic similarity among the different colour patterns was precisely quantified using a custom algorithm accounting for both colour and pattern variations (CPM method). By analysing attack behaviours of 491 game players, we found that learning was more efficient in the simple prey community. Additionally, profitable prey gained protection from sharing key visual features with unprofitable prey in both communities while learning, in accordance with natural predator behaviours. Moreover, other behaviours observed in natural predators, such as colour neophobia, were detected in humans and shaped morph vulnerability during the game. Similarities between our results in humans and the reaction of natural predator communities to the same colour patterns validate our video-game as a useful proxy to study predator behaviour. This experimental set-up can thus be compared to natural systems, enabling further investigations of generalisation on mimicry evolution.",

    "abstract": "Genebanks are valuable resources for crop improvement through the acquisition, ex-situ conservation and sharing of unique germplasm among plant breeders and geneticists. With over seven million existing accessions and increasing storage demands and costs, genebanks need efficient characterization and curation to make them more accessible and usable and to reduce operating costs, so that the crop improvement community can most effectively leverage this vast resource of untapped novel genetic diversity. However, the sharing and inconsistent documentation of germplasm often results in unintentionally duplicated collections with poor characterization and many identical accessions that can be hard or impossible to identify without passport information and unmatched accession identifiers. Here we demonstrate the use of genotypic information from these accessions using a cost-effective next generation sequencing platform to find and remove duplications. We identify and characterize over 50% duplicated accessions both within and across genebank collections of Aegilops tauschii, an important wild relative of wheat and source of genetic diversity for wheat improvement. We present a pipeline to identify and remove identical accessions within and among genebanks and curate globally unique accessions. We also show how this approach can also be applied to future collection efforts to avoid the accumulation of identical material. When coordinated across global genebanks, this approach will ultimately allow for cost effective and efficient management of germplasm and better stewarding of these valuable resources.",

We characterize the structure of networks in different electroencephalographic frequency bands while individuals perform a working memory task. The objective was to identify network properties that support working memory function during the encoding, maintenance, and retrieval of memory. In each EEG frequency band, we estimated a complex-valued Gaussian graphical model to characterize the structure of brain networks using measures from graph theory. Critically, the structural characteristics of brain networks that facilitate performance are all established during encoding, suggesting that they reflect the effect of attention on the quality of the representation in working memory. Segregation of networks in the alpha and beta bands during encoding increased with accuracy. In the theta band, greater integration of functional clusters involving the temporal lobe with other cortical areas predicted faster response time, starting in the encoding interval and persisting throughout the task, indicating that functional clustering facilitates rapid memory manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Oligodendrocytes ensheath neuronal axons with myelin, a proteolipid-rich membrane that increases conduction velocity and provides trophic support. Our lab and others have provided evidence that vesicular release from neurons promotes myelin sheath growth. Complementarily, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches have revealed that oligodendrocytes express many proteins that allow dendrites to sense and respond to vesicular release at synapses. Do axon-myelin contacts use similar communication mechanisms as nascent synapses to form myelin sheaths on axons? To test this, we used fusion proteins to track synaptic vesicle localization and membrane fusion within spinal cord axons of zebrafish larvae during developmental myelination. Additionally, we used a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated GAL4 enhancer trap and genetically-encoded intrabody to detect expression and localization of PSD-95, a component of dendritic postsynaptic complexes, within oligodendrocytes. We found that synaptic vesicles accumulate at ensheathment sites over time and are exocytosed with variable patterning underneath myelin sheaths. Accordingly, we also found that most, but not all sheaths localized PSD-95 with patterning similar to exocytosis site location within the axon. By querying published transcriptome databases, we found that oligodendrocytes express numerous transsynaptic adhesion molecules that function across synapses to promote synapse formation and maturation. Disruption of candidate PDZ-binding transsynaptic adhesion proteins in oligodendrocytes revealed that these proteins have variable effects on sheath length and number. We focused on one candidate, Cadm1b (SynCAM1), and demonstrated that it localized to myelin sheaths where both its PDZ binding and extracellular adhesion to axons are required for myelin sheath growth. Our work reveals shared mechanisms of synaptic and myelin plasticity and provides new targets for mechanistic unraveling of activity-regulated myelination.",

    "abstract": "Activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) was proposed to inhibit the cold and menthol sensitive Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channels via direct binding of Gq to the channel. It is well documented that TRPM8 requires the plasma membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2 or PIP2] for activity. It was claimed however that a decrease in cellular levels of this lipid does not contribute to channel inhibition upon receptor activation. Here we show that supplementing the whole cell patch pipette with PI(4,5)P2 reduced inhibition of TRPM8 by activation of Gq-coupled receptors in mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Activation of the same receptors induced Phospholipase C (PLC) activation and decreased plasma membrane PI(4,5)P2 levels in these neurons. PI(4,5)P2 also reduced inhibition of TRPM8 by activation of heterologously expressed Gq-coupled muscarinic M1 receptors. Co-expression of a constitutively active Gq protein that does not couple to PLC inhibited TRPM8 activity, and in cells expressing this protein decreasing PI(4,5)P2 levels using a voltage sensitive 5-phosphatase induced a stronger inhibition of TRPM8 activity than in control cells. Our data indicate that PI(4,5)P2 depletion plays an important role in TRPM8 inhibition upon GPCR activation, and Gq inhibits the channel by reducing its apparent affinity for PI(4,5)P2 and thus sensitizes the channel to inhibition by decreasing PI(4,5)P2 levels.",

To that end, wide-field fluorescent microscopy and a robotic device for motor control were combined for simultaneous recording of cortical neuronal-activity, force applied and forelimb position during task execution.\\n\\nOur results show that jRCaMP1a has sufficient sensitivity to monitor in vivo neuronal activity over multiple functional areas, and can be successfully used to perform longitudinal imaging in awake mice.",

    "abstract": "Explicit awareness of a task is often evoked during rehabilitation and sports training with the intention of accelerating learning and improving performance. However, the effects of awareness of perturbations on the resulting sensory and motor changes produced during motor learning are not well understood. Here, we use explicit instructions as well as large rotation sizes to generate awareness of the perturbation during a visuomotor rotation task and test the resulting changes in both perceived and predicted sensory consequences as well as implicit motor changes.\\n\\nWe split participants into 4 groups which differ in both magnitude of the rotation (either 30{degrees} or 60{degrees}) during adaptation, and whether they receive a strategy to counter the rotation or not prior to adaptation. Performance benefits of explicit instruction are largest during early adaptation but continued to lead to improved performance through 90 trials of training. We show that with either instruction, or with large perturbations, participants become aware of countering the rotation. However, we find a base amount of implicit learning, with equal magnitudes, across all groups, even when asked to exclude any strategies while reaching with no visual feedback of the hand.\\n\\nParticipants also estimate the location of the unseen hand when it is moved by the robot (passive localization) and when they generate their own movement (active localization) following adaptation. These learning-induced shifts in estimates of hand position reflect both proprioceptive recalibration and updates in the predicted consequences of movements. We find that these estimates of felt hand position, which reflect updates in both proprioception and efference based estimates of hand position, shift significantly for all groups and were not modulated by either instruction or perturbation size.\\n\\nOur results indicate that not all processes of motor learning benefit from an explicit awareness of the task. Particularly, proprioceptive recalibration and the updating of predicted sensory consequences are largely implicit processes.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide synthases (eNOS, nNOS) are important signal generators in a number of processes including angiogenesis and neurotransmission. The homologous inducible isoform (iNOS) occupies a multitude of conformational states in a catalytic cycle, including subnanosecond input and output states and a distribution of  open conformations with average lifetimes of ~4.3 ns. In this study, fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy was used to probe conformational states of purified eNOS and nNOS in the presence of chaotropes, calmodulin, NADP+ and NADPH. Two-domain FMN/oxygenase constructs of nNOS were also examined with respect to calmodulin effects. Optical biosensing was used to analyze calmodulin binding in the presence of NADP+ and NADPH. Calmodulin binding induced a shift of the population away from the input and to the open and output states of NOS. NADP+ shifted the population towards the input state. The oxygenase domain, lacking the input state, provided a measure of calmodulin-induced open-output transitions. A mechanism for regulation by calmodulin and an elucidation of the catalytic mechanism are suggested by a  conformational lockdown model. Calmodulin speeds transitions between input and open and between open and output states, effectively reducing the conformational manifold, speeding catalysis. Conformational control of catalysis involves reorientation of the FMN binding domain, of which fluorescence lifetime is an indicator. The approach described herein is a new tool for biophysical and structural analysis of NOS enzymes, regulatory events and other homologous reductase-containing enzymes.\\n\\nA note to the readerThis manuscript has over the past several years been submitted to and rejected by several journals, usually on the basis of reviewer opinion that it was not an important enough result to merit inclusion in the journal. Owing to the passing of the first author and the loss of his expertise in fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy, it has become too onerous a task to continually revise the manuscript to suit the whims of reviewers who nevertheless still reject the work. We are thus simply releasing the final form of the manuscript to BioRxiv in the hopes that it finds a readership who will find, as we do, that the results are of value to the field.",

These processes can be directed by growth factor signaling pathways. However, little is known about how such morphological changes affect the spatiotemporal distribution of growth factor signaling. Here, using the Drosophila pupal wing, we address how Decapentaplegic (Dpp) / Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling and 3D wing morphogenesis are coupled. Dpp, expressed in the longitudinal veins (LVs) of the pupal wing, initially diffuses laterally during the inflation stage to regulate cell proliferation. Dpp localization is then refined to the LVs within each epithelial plane, but with active interplanar signaling for vein patterning, as the two epithelia appose. Our data further suggest that the 3D architecture of the wing epithelia directs the spatial distribution of BMP signaling, revealing how 3D morphogenesis is an emergent property of the interactions between extracellular signaling and tissue shape changes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how afferent information is integrated by cortical structures requires identifying the factors shaping excitation and inhibition within their input layers. The input layer of the cerebellar cortex integrates diverse sensorimotor information to enable learned associations that refine the dynamics of movement. Specifically, mossy fiber afferents relay sensorimotor input into the cerebellum to excite granule cells, whose activity is regulated by inhibitory Golgi cells. To test how this integration can be modulated, we have used an acute brain slice preparation from young adult rats and found that encoding of mossy fiber input in the cerebellar granule cell layer can be regulated by serotonin (5-HT) via a specific action on Golgi cells. We find that 5-HT depolarizes Golgi cells, likely by activating 5-HT2A receptors, but does not directly act on either granule cells or mossy fibers. As a result of Golgi cell depolarization, 5-HT significantly increases tonic inhibition onto both granule cells and Golgi cells. 5-HT-mediated Golgi cell depolarization is not sufficient, however, to alter the probability or timing of mossy fiber-evoked feed-forward inhibition onto granule cells. Together, increased granule cell tonic inhibition paired with normal feed-forward inhibition acts to reduce granule cell spike probability without altering spike timing. These data hence provide a circuit mechanism by which 5-HT can reduce granule cell activity without altering temporal representations of mossy fiber input. Such changes in network integration could enable flexible, state-specific suppression of cerebellar sensorimotor input that should not be learned, or enable reversal learning for unwanted associations.\\n\\nNew and Noteworthy5-HT regulates synaptic integration at the input stage of cerebellar processing by increasing tonic inhibition of granule cells. This circuit mechanism reduces the probability of granule cell spiking without altering spike timing, thus suppressing cerebellar input without altering its temporal representation in the granule cell layer.",

    "abstract": "During cortical development, distinct subtypes of glutamatergic neurons are sequentially born and differentiate from dynamic populations of progenitors. The neurogenic competence of these progenitors progresses as corticogenesis proceeds; likewise, newborn neurons transit through sequential states as they differentiate. Here, we trace the developmental transcriptional trajectories of successive generations of apical progenitors (APs) and isochronic cohorts of their daughter neurons using parallel single-cell RNA sequencing between embryonic day (E) 12 and E15 in the mouse cerebral cortex. Our results identify the birthdate- and differentiation stage-related transcriptional dynamics at play during corticogenesis. As corticogenesis proceeds, APs transit through embryonic age-dependent molecular states, which are transmitted to their progeny to generate successive initial daughter cell identities. In neurons, essentially conserved post-mitotic differentiation programs are applied onto these distinct AP-derived ground states, allowing temporally-regulated sequential emergence of specialized neuronal cell types. Molecular temporal patterning of sequentially-born daughter neurons by their respective mother cell thus underlies emergence of neuronal diversity in the neocortex.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryDuring corticogenesis, temporally dynamic molecular birthmarks are transmitted from progenitors to their post-mitotic progeny to generate neuronal diversity.",

For two-photon imaging data, composed of fundamentally probabilistic streams of photon detections, the problem is particularly acute. Here, we present a complete statistical pipeline for the inference and analysis of neural activity using Gaussian Process Regression, applied to two-photon recordings of light-driven activity in ex vivo mouse retina. We demonstrate the flexibility and extensibility of these models, considering cases with non-stationary statistics, driven by complex parametric stimuli, in signal discrimination, hierarchical clustering and inference tasks. Sparse approximation methods allow these models to be fitted rapidly, permitting them to actively guiding the design of light stimulation in the midst of ongoing two-photon experiments.",

    "abstract": "The current study investigates a new neurobiological model of human hand choice: The Posterior Parietal Interhemispheric Competition (PPIC) model. The model specifies that neural populations in bilateral posterior intraparietal and superior parietal cortex (pIP-SPC) encode actions in hand-specific terms, and compete for selection across and within hemispheres. Actions with both hands are encoded bilaterally, but the contralateral hand is overrepresented. We use a novel fMRI paradigm to test the PPIC model. Participants reach to visible targets while in the scanner, and conditions involving free choice of which hand to use (Choice) are compared with when hand-use is instructed. Consistent with the PPIC model, bilateral pIP-SPC is preferentially responsive for the Choice condition, and for actions made with the contralateral hand. In the right pIP-SPC, these effects include anterior intraparietal and superior parieto-occipital cortex. Left dorsal premotor cortex, and an area in the right lateral occipitotemporal cortex show the same response pattern, while the left inferior parietal lobule is preferentially responsive for the Choice condition and when using the ipsilateral hand. Behaviourally, hand choice is biased by target location - for targets near the left/right edges of the display, the hand in ipsilateral hemispace is favoured. Moreover, consistent with a competitive process, response times are prolonged for choices to more ambiguous targets, where hand choice is relatively unbiased, and fMRI responses in bilateral pIP-SPC parallel this pattern. Our data provide support for the PPIC model, and reveal a selective network of brain areas involved in free hand choice, including bilateral posterior parietal cortex, left-lateralized inferior parietal and dorsal premotor cortices, and the right lateral occipitotemporal cortex.",

How the various inhibitory cell types contribute to neuronal information processing, however, is not resolved. Here, we propose a functional role for a widespread network motif consisting of parvalbumin-(PV), somatostatin-(SOM) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons. Following the idea that PV and SOM interneurons control the distribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition onto PCs, we suggest that mutual inhibition between VIP and SOM cells translates weak inputs to VIP interneurons into large changes of somato-dendritic inhibition of PCs. Using a computational model, we show that the neuronal and synaptic properties of the circuit support this hypothesis. Moreover, we show that the SOM-VIP motif allows transient inputs to persistently switch the circuit between two processing modes, in which top-down inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs are either integrated or canceled.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes express a complex repertoire of intracellular Ca2+ transients (events) that represent a major form of signaling within individual cells and in the astrocytic syncytium. These events have different spatiotemporal profiles, which are modulated by neuronal activity. Spontaneous Ca2+ events appear more frequently in distal astrocytic processes and independently from each other. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying such subcellular distribution of the Ca2+ events. Here we identify the initiation points of the Ca2+ events within the territory of single astrocytes expressing genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator GCaMP2 in culture or in hippocampal slices. We found that most of the Ca2+ events start in thin distal processes. Our mathematical model demonstrated that a high surface-to-volume (SVR) of the thin processes leads to increased amplitude of baseline Ca2+ fluctuations caused by a stochastic opening of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane. Suprathreshold fluctuations trigger Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from the Ca2+ stores by activating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors. In agreement with the model prediction, the spontaneous Ca2+ events frequency depended on the extracellular Ca2+ concentration. Astrocytic depolarization by high extracellular K+ increased the frequency of the Ca2+ events through activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) in cultured astrocytes. Our results suggest that the morphological profile of the astrocytic processes is responsible for tuning of the Ca2+ event frequency. Therefore, the structural plasticity of astrocytic processes can be directly translated into changes in astrocytic Ca2+ signaling. This may be important for both physiological and pathological astrocyte remodeling.\\n\\nMain pointsO_LIMajority of spontaneous Ca2+ events start in thin astrocytic processes\\nC_LIO_LIHigher surface-to-volume ratio of the process is responsible for larger intracellular Ca2+ fluctuations\\nC_LIO_LILarger intracellular Ca2+ fluctuations trigger Ca2+-dependent Ca2+ release\\nC_LI",

C. elegans has two salt-sensing neurons, ASEL and ASER, that show opposite responses to stepped changes in stimulus levels, however only ASER has been shown to play a prominent role in salt chemotaxis. We used pre-exposure to natural stimuli to manipulate the responsiveness of these neurons and tested their separate contributions to behavior.

In this study, we demonstrate that internal structure in diffusion anisotropy is not necessary for a plausible parcellation to be obtained, by spatially permuting diffusion parameters within the thalami and repeating the parcellation. Moreover, we show that, in a winner-takes-all paradigm, most voxels receive the same label before and after this shuffling process--a finding that is stable across image acquisitions and tractography algorithms. We therefore suggest that such parcellations should be interpreted with caution.",

In particular, little is known about whether patterns of functional connectivity (FC) differ down the anterior-posterior axis of each subfield. Here, using high resolution structural MRI we delineated the hippocampal subfields in healthy young adults. This included the CA fields, separating DG/CA4 from CA3, separating the pre/parasubiculum from the subiculum, and also segmenting the uncus. We then used high resolution resting state functional MRI to interrogate FC. We first analysed the FC of each hippocampal subfield in its entirety, in terms of FC with other subfields and with the neighbouring regions, namely entorhinal, perirhinal, posterior parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortices. Next, we analysed FC for different portions of each hippocampal subfield along its anterior-posterior axis, in terms of FC between different parts of a subfield, FC with other subfield portions, and FC of each subfield portion with the neighbouring cortical regions of interest. We found that intrinsic functional connectivity between the subfields aligned generally with the tri-synaptic circuit but also extended beyond it. Our findings also revealed that patterns of functional connectivity between the subfields and neighbouring cortical areas differed markedly along the anterior-posterior axis of each hippocampal subfield.

Both conditions were presented interleaved in one stream, and separated by variable inter-stimulus intervals such that there was no dominant stimulus rhythm throughout. Even though participants were unaware of the implicit temporal contingencies, pitch discrimination sensitivity (i.e. the slope of the psychometric function) increased when the onset of the target tone was predictable in time (N = 49). Concurrently recorded EEG data (N = 24) revealed that standard tones which initiated temporal predictions evoked a more negative N1 component than non-predictive standards, and were followed by an increase in delta power during the foreperiod. Furthermore, the phase angle of delta oscillations (1-3Hz) evoked by the standard tone predicted pitch discrimination sensitivity at the target tone (1.75 s later on average), which suggests that temporal predictions can be initiated by an optimized delta phase reset. In sum, we show that auditory perception benefits from implicit temporal contingencies, and provide evidence for a role of slow neural oscillations in the endogenous representation of temporal predictions, in absence of exogenously driven entrainment to rhythmic input.\n\nSignificance StatementTemporal contingencies are ubiquitous in sensory environments, especially in the auditory domain, and have been shown to facilitate perception and action. Yet, how these contingencies in exogenous inputs are transformed into an endogenous representation of temporal predictions is not known. Here, we implicitly induced temporal predictability in the absence of a rhythmic input structure, that is without exogenously driven entrainment of neural oscillations. Our results show that even implicit and non-rhythmic temporal predictions are extracted and used by human observers, underlining the role of timing in sensory processing. Furthermore, our EEG results point towards an instrumental role of delta oscillations in initiating temporal predictions by an optimized phase reset in response to a temporally predictive cue.",
