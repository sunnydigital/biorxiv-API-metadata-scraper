    "abstract": "Despite its popularity, characterization of subpopulations with transcript abundance is subject to a significant amount of noise. We propose to use effective and expressed nucleotide variations (eeSNVs) from scRNA-seq as alternative features for tumor subpopulation identification. We developed a linear modeling framework, SSrGE, to link eeSNVs associated with gene expression. In all the datasets tested, eeSNVs achieve better accuracies than gene expression for identifying subpopulations. Previously validated cancer-relevant genes are also highly ranked, confirming the significance of the method. Moreover, SSrGE is capable of analyzing coupled DNA-seq and RNA-seq data from the same single cells, demonstrating its value in integrating multi-omics single cell techniques. In summary, SNV features from scRNA-seq data have merits for both subpopulation identification and linkage of genotype-phenotype relationship. The method SSrGE is available at https://github.com/lanagarmire/SSrGE.",

    "abstract": "As smartphone usage has become increasingly prevalent in our society, so have rates of depression, particularly among young adults. Individual differences in smartphone usage patterns have been shown to reflect individual differences in underlying affective processes such as depression (Wang et al., 2018). In the current study, we identified a positive relationship between smartphone screen time (e.g. phone unlock duration) and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the subgenual cingulate cortex (sgCC), a brain region implicated in depression and antidepressant treatment response, and regions of the ventromedial/orbitofrontal cortex, such that increased phone usage was related to stronger connectivity between these regions. We then used this cluster to constrain subsequent analyses looking at depressive symptoms in the same cohort and observed partial replication in a separate cohort. We believe the data and analyses presented here provide relatively simplistic initial analyses which replicate and provide a first step in combining functional brain activity and smartphone usage patterns to better understand issues related to mental health. Smartphones are a prevalent part of modern life and the usage of mobile sensing data from smartphones promises to be an important tool for mental health diagnostics and neuroscience research.",

We incorporated these models into an app, \\\"Ebola Care Guidelines\\\", that provides access to recommended, evidence-based supportive care guidelines and highlights the signs/symptoms with the largest contribution to prognosis.\\n\\nMethodsWe applied multivariate logistic regression on 470 patients admitted to five Ebola treatment units in Liberia and Sierra Leone during the 2014-16 outbreak. We validated the models with two independent datasets from Sierra Leone.\\n\\nFindingsViral load and age were the most important predictors of death. We generated a parsimonious model including viral load, age, body temperature, bleeding, jaundice, dyspnea, dysphagia, and referral time recorded at triage. We also constructed fallback models for when variables in the parsimonious model are unavailable. The performance of the parsimonious model approached the predictive power of observational wellness assessments by experienced health workers, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 and overall accuracy of 64% to 74%.\\n\\nInterpretationMachine-learning models and mHealth tools have the potential for improving the standard of care in low-resource settings and emergency scenarios, but data incompleteness and lack of generalizable models are major obstacles. We showed how harmonization of multiple datasets yields prognostic models that can be validated across different cohorts. Similar performance between the parsimonious model and those incorporating expert wellness assessments suggests that clinically-guided machine learning approaches can recapitulate clinical expertise, and thus be useful when such expertise is unavailable. We also demonstrated with our guidelines app how integration of those models with mobile technologies enables deployable clinical management support tools that facilitate access to comprehensive bodies of medical knowledge.\\n\\nFundingHoward Hughes Medical Institute, US National Institutes of Health",

    "abstract": "The cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus is composed of peptidoglycan and the anionic polymers lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and wall teichoic acid. LTA is required for growth and normal cell morphology in S. aureus. Strains lacking LTA are usually only viable when grown under osmotically stabilizing conditions or after the acquisition of compensatory mutations. LTA negative suppressor strains with inactivating mutations in gdpP, resulting in an increase in intracellular c-di-AMP levels, have been described previously. Here, we sought to identify factors other than c-di-AMP that allow S. aureus to survive without LTA. LTA-negative strains able to grow in un-supplemented medium were obtained and found to contain mutations in sgtB, mazE, clpX or vraT. The growth improvement through mutations in mazE and sgtB was confirmed by complementation analysis. We also show that an S. aureus sgtB transposon mutant, inactivated for the monofunctional peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase SgtB, displays a 4-fold increase in the MIC towards a number of cell wall-targeting antibiotics, suggesting that alteration in the peptidoglycan structure could help bacteria compensate for the lack of LTA. Muropeptide analysis of peptidoglycan isolated from a WT and sgtB mutant strains did not reveal any sizable alternations in the peptidoglycan structure. In contrast, the peptidoglycan isolated from an LTA-negative ltaS mutant strain showed a significant reduction in the fraction of highly crosslinked peptidoglycan, which was partially rescued in the sgtB/ltaS double mutant suppressor strain. Taken together, these data point towards an important function of LTA in cell wall integrity through its requirement for proper peptidoglycan assembly.\\n\\nImportanceThe bacterial cell wall acts as primary defence against environmental insults such as changes in osmolarity. It is also a vulnerable structure as defects in its synthesis can lead to growth arrest or cell death. The important human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus has a typical Gram-positive cell wall, which consists of peptidoglycan and the anionic polymers lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and wall teichoic acid. Several clinically relevant antibiotics inhibit the synthesis of peptidoglycan; hence it and teichoic acids are considered attractive targets for the development of new antimicrobials. We show that LTA is required for efficient peptidoglycan crosslinking in S. aureus and inactivation of a peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase can partially rescue this defect, altogether revealing an intimate link between peptidoglycan and LTA synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Methylation of histone H3 on lysine 79 (H3K79) by DOT1L is associated with actively transcribed genes. Earlier, we described that DOT-1.1, the Caenorhabditis elegans DOT1L homologue, cooperates with the chromatin-binding protein ZFP-1 (AF10 homologue) to negatively modulate transcription of highly and widely expressed target genes. Also, reduction in ZFP-1 levels has long been associated with lower efficiency of RNA interference (RNAi) triggered by exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), but the reason for this is not clear. Here, we demonstrate that DOT1L suppresses bidirectional transcription, including that producing enhancer RNAs, thereby preventing dsRNA formation and ectopic RNAi. This ectopic elevation of endogenous dsRNA may engage the Dicer complex and, therefore, limit efficiency of exogenous RNAi. Our insight provides a novel perspective on the underlying mechanisms of DOT1L function in development, neural activity, and cancer.",

Here we show that, in the drh-3(ne4253) mutant deficient in RdRP-produced secondary endo-siRNAs, the silencing histone mark H3K9me3 is largely depleted, whereas in the csr-1 partial loss-of-function mutant this mark is ectopically deposited on CSR-1 target genes. Moreover, we observe ectopic H3K9me3 at enhancer elements in both drh-3 and csr-1 partial loss-of-function mutants and describe small RNAs matching enhancers. Finally, we detect accumulation of H3K27me3 at highly expressed genes in the drh-3(ne4253) mutant, which correlates with their reduced transcription. Our study shows that when abundant RdRP-produced siRNAs are depleted, there is ectopic elevation of noncoding RNAs linked to increase in silencing chromatin marks.

    "abstract": "Trabecular architecture (i.e., the main orientation of the bone trabeculae, their number, mean thickness, spacing, etc.) has been shown experimentally to adapt with great accuracy and sensitivity to the loadings applied to the bone during life. However, the potential of trabecular parameters used as a proxy for the mechanical environment of an organisms organ to help reconstruct the lifestyle of extinct taxa has only recently started to be exploited. Furthermore, these parameters are rarely combined to the long-used mid-diaphyseal parameters to inform such reconstructions. Here we investigate xenarthrans, for which functional and ecological reconstructions of extinct forms are particularly important in order to improve our macroevolutionary understanding of their main constitutive clades, i.e., the Tardigrada (sloths), Vermilingua (anteaters), and Cingulata (armadillos and extinct close relatives). The lifestyles of modern xenarthrans can be classified as fully terrestrial and highly fossorial (armadillos), arboreal (partly to fully) and hook-and-pull digging (anteaters), or suspensory (fully arboreal) and non-fossorial (sloths). The degree of arboreality and fossoriality of some extinct forms, \\\"ground sloths\\\" in particular, is highly debated. We used high-resolution computed tomography to compare the epiphyseal 3D architecture and mid-diaphyseal structure of the forelimb bones of extant and extinct xenarthrans. The comparative approach employed aims at inferring the most probable lifestyle of extinct taxa, using a phylogenetically informed discriminant analysis. Several challenges preventing the attribution of one of the extant xenarthran lifestyles to the sampled extinct sloths were identified. Differing from that of the larger \\\"ground sloths\\\", the bone structure of the small-sized Hapalops (Miocene of Argentina), however, was found as significantly more similar to that of extant sloths, even when accounting for the phylogenetic signal.",

    "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is common and disabling, but its neural pathophysiology remains unclear. Functional brain network studies in MDD have largely had limited statistical power and data analysis approaches have varied widely. The REST-meta-MDD Project of resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) addresses these issues. The 25 research groups in China composing the REST-meta-MDD Project contributed R-fMRI data of 1,300 patients with MDD and 1,128 normal controls (NCs). The data were preprocessed locally with a standardized protocol prior to aggregated group analyses. We focused on functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN), frequently reported to show increased FC in MDD. We found decreased instead of increased DMN FC when comparing 848 MDDs with 794 NCs from 17 sites after data exclusion. We found FC reduction only in recurrent MDD, not in first-episode drug-naive MDD. Decreased DMN FC was associated with medication usage but not with MDD duration. DMN FC was also positively related to symptom severity but only in recurrent MDDs. Exploratory analyses also revealed alterations of local intrinsic activity in MDD. We confirmed the key role of DMN in MDD but found reduced rather than increased FC within the DMN. Future studies should test whether decreased DMN FC mediates treatment response. This manuscript announces the publicly available resting-state fMRI indices of the REST-meta-MDD consortium shared via the R-fMRI Maps Project.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFunctional connectivity within the default mode network in major depressive disorder patients has been frequently reported abnormal but with contradicting directions in previous small sample size studies. By creating the REST-meta-MDD consortium containing neuroimaging data of 1,300 depressed patients and 1,128 normal controls from 25 research groups in China, we found decreased default mode network functional connectivity in depressed patients, driven by patients with recurrent depression, and associated with current medication treatment but not with disease duration. These findings suggest that default mode network functional connectivity remains a prime target for understanding the pathophysiology of depression, with particular relevance to revealing mechanisms of effective treatments.",

    "abstract": "GWAS have identified numerous SNPs associated with prostate cancer risk. One such SNP is rs10993994. It is located in the MSMB promoter, associates with MSMB encoded {beta}-microseminoprotein prostate secretion levels, and is associated with mRNA expression changes in MSMB and the adjacent gene NCOA4. In addition, our previous work showed a second SNP, rs7098889, is in LD with rs10993994 and associated with MSMB expression independent of rs10993994. Here, we generate a series of clones with single alleles removed by double guide RNA (gRNA) mediated CRISPR/Cas9 deletions, through which we demonstrate that each of these SNPs independently and greatly alters MSMB expression in an allele-specific manner. We further show that these SNPs have no substantial effect on the expression of NCOA4. These data demonstrate that a single SNP can have a large effect on gene expression and illustrate the importance of functional validation to deconvolute observed correlations. The method we have developed is generally applicable to test any SNP for which a relevant heterozygous cell line is available.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn pursuing the underlying biological mechanism of prostate cancer pathogenesis, scientists utilized the existence of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human genome as genetic markers to perform large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) and have so far identified more than a hundred prostate cancer risk variants. Such variants provide an unbiased and systematic new venue to study the disease mechanism, and the next big challenge is to translate these genetic associations to the causal role of altered gene function in oncogenesis. The majority of these variants are waiting to be studied and lots of them may act in oncogenesis through gene expression regulation. To prove the concept, we took rs10993994 and its linked rs7098889 as an example and engineered single cell clones by allelic-specific CRISPR/Cas9 deletion to separate the effect of each allele. We observed that a single nucleotide difference would lead to surprisingly high level of MSMB gene expression change in a gene specific and tissue specific manner. Our study strongly supports the notion that differential level of gene expression caused by risk variants and their associated genetic locus play a major role in oncogenesis and also highlights the importance of studying the function of MSMB encoded {beta}-MSP in prostate cancer pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) requires RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) in many eukaryotes, and RNAi amplification constitutes the only known function for eukaryotic RdRPs. Yet in animals, classical model organisms can elicit RNAi without possessing RdRPs, and only nematode RNAi was shown to require RdRPs. Here we show that RdRP genes are much more common in animals than previously thought, even in insects, where they had been assumed not to exist. RdRP genes were present in the ancestors of numerous clades, and they were subsequently lost at a high frequency. In order to probe the function of RdRPs in a deuterostome (the cephalochordate Branchiostoma lanceolatum), we performed high-throughput analyses of small RNAs from various Branchiostoma developmental stages. Our results show that Branchiostoma RdRPs do not appear to participate in RNAi: we did not detect any candidate small RNA population exhibiting classical siRNA length or sequence features. Our results show that RdRPs have been independently lost in dozens of animal clades, and even in a clade where they have been conserved (cephalochordates) their function in RNAi amplification is not preserved. Such a dramatic functional variability reveals an unexpected plasticity in RNA silencing pathways.\\n\\nAuthor summaryRNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved gene regulation system in eukaryotes. In non-animal eukaryotes, it necessitates RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (\\\"RdRPs\\\"). Among animals, only nematodes appear to require RdRPs for RNAi. Yet additional animal clades have RdRPs and it is assumed that they participate in RNAi. Here, we find that RdRPs are much more common in animals than previously thought, but their genes were independently lost in many lineages. Focusing on a species with RdRP genes (a cephalochordate), we found that it does not use them for RNAi. While RNAi is the only known function for eukaryotic RdRPs, our results suggest additional roles. Eukaryotic RdRPs thus have a complex evolutionary history in animals, with frequent independent losses and apparent functional diversification.",

    "abstract": "The nutritional conditions experienced by a population play a major role in shaping trait evolution in many taxa. Constraints exerted by nutrient limitation or nutrient imbalance can influence the maximal value that fitness components such as reproduction and lifespan attains, and organisms may shift how resources are allocated to different structures and functions in response to changes in nutrition. Whether the phenotypic changes associated with changes in nutrition represent an adaptive response is largely unknown. Further, it is unclear whether the response of fitness components to diet even has the potential to evolve in most systems. In this study, we use an admixed multiparental population of Drosophila melanogaster reared in three different diet conditions to estimate quantitative genetic parameters for lifespan and fecundity. We find significant genetic variation for both traits in our population and show that lifespan has moderate to high heritabilities within diets. Genetic correlations for lifespan between diets were significantly less than one, demonstrating a strong genotype by diet interaction. These findings demonstrate substantial standing genetic variation in our population that is comparable to natural populations and highlights the potential for adaptation to changing nutritional environments.",

    "abstract": "The improvement of sequencing technologies has allowed the generalization of metagenomic sequencing, which has become a standard procedure for analysing the structure and functionality of microbiomes. The bioinformatic analysis of the sequencing results poses a challenge because it involves many different complex steps. SqueezeMeta is a full automatic pipeline for metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, covering all steps of the analysis. SqueezeMeta includes multi-metagenome support allowing the co-assembly of related metagenomes and the retrieval of individual genomes via binning procedures. SqueezeMeta features several unique characteristics: Co-assembly procedure or co-assembly of unlimited number of metagenomes via merging of individual assembled metagenomes, both with read mapping for estimation of the abundances of genes in each metagenome. It also includes binning and bin checking for retrieving individual genomes. Internal checks for the assembly and binning steps inform about the consistency of contigs and bins. Also, the results are stored in a mySQL database, where they can be easily exported and shared, and can be inspected anywhere using a flexible web interface allowing the easy creation of complex queries.\\n\\nWe illustrate the potential of SqueezeMeta by analyzing 32 gut metagenomes in a fully automatic way, allowing to retrieve several millions of genes and several hundreds of genomic bins.\\n\\nOne of the motivations in the development of SqueezeMeta was producing a software capable to run in small desktop computers, thus being amenable to all users and all settings. We were also able to co-assemble two of these metagenomes and complete the full analysis in less than one day using a simple laptop computer, illustrating the capacity of SqueezeMeta to run without high-performance computing infrastructure. SqueezeMeta is a complete system covering all steps in the analysis of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes, capable to work even in scarcity of computational resources. It is therefore adequate for in-situ, real time analysis of metagenomes produced by nanopore sequencing.\\n\\nSqueezeMeta can be downloaded from https://github.com/jtamames/SqueezeMeta",

    "abstract": "Cortical D2 dopamine receptor (Drd2) have mostly been examined in the context of cognitive function regulation and neurotransmission modulation of medial prefrontal cortex by principal neurons and parvalbumin positive, fast-spiking, interneurons in schizophrenia. Early studies suggested the presence of D2 receptors in several cortical areas, albeit with major technical limitations. We used combinations of transgenic reporter systems, recombinase activated viral vectors, quantitative translatome analysis and high sensitivity in situ hybridization to identify D2 receptor expressing cells and establish a map of their respective projections. Our results identified previously uncharacterized clusters of D2 expressing neurons in limbic and sensory regions of the adult mouse brain cortex. Characterization of these clusters by translatome analysis and cell type specific labeling revealed highly heterogeneous expression of D2 receptors in principal neurons and various populations of interneurons across cortical areas. Transcript enrichment analysis also demonstrated variable levels of D2 receptor expression and several orphan G-protein-coupled receptors co-expression in different neuronal clusters, thus suggesting strategies for genetic and therapeutic targeting of D2 expressing neurons in specific cortical areas. These results pave the way for a thorough reexamination of cortical D2 receptor functions, which could provide information about neuronal circuits involved in psychotic and mood disorders.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive saccades benefit memory when executed before retrieval, with greatest effects for episodic memory in consistent-handers. Questions remain including how saccades affect scene memory, an important visual component of episodic memory. The present study tested how repetitive saccades affect working and recognition memory for novel scenes. Handedness direction (left-right) and degree (strong/consistent vs. mixed/inconsistent) was measured by raw and absolute laterality quotients respectively from an 8-question handedness inventory completed by 111 adults. Each then performed either 30 seconds of repetitive horizontal saccades or fixation before or after tasks of scene working memory and scene recognition. Regression with criterion variables of overall percent correct accuracy and d-prime sensitivity showed that when saccades were made before working memory, there was better overall accuracy as a function of increased direction but not degree of handedness. Subjects who made saccades before working memory also performed worse during subsequent recognition memory, while subjects who fixated or made saccades after the working memory task performed better. Saccades made before recognition resulted in recognition accuracy that was better (Cohens d=0.3729), but not significantly different from fixation before recognition. The results demonstrate saccades and handedness interact to affect scene memory with larger effects on encoding than recognition. Saccades before scene encoding in working memory are detrimental to short- and long-term memory, especially for those who are not consistently right-handed, while saccade execution before scene recognition does not appear to benefit recognition accuracy. The findings are discussed with respect to theories of interhemispheric interaction and control of visuospatial attention.",

Less is known about changes in the correlated expression of genes after SCI. We investigated gene co-expression networks among voltage-gated ion channel and neurotransmitter receptor mRNA levels using quantitative RT-PCR in longitudinal slices of the mouse lumbar spinal cord in control and chronic SCI animals. These longitudinal slices were made from the ventral surface of the cord, thus forming slices relatively enriched in motor neurons or interneurons. We performed absolute quantitation of mRNA copy number for 50 ion channel or receptor transcripts from each sample, and used multiple correlation analyses to detect patterns in correlated mRNA levels across all pairs of genes. The majority of channels and receptors changed in expression as a result of chronic SCI, but did so differently across slice levels. Furthermore, motor neuron enriched slices experienced an overall loss of correlated channel and receptor expression, while interneuron slices showed a dramatic increase in the number of positively correlated transcripts. These correlation profiles suggest that spinal cord injury induces distinct changes across cell types in the organization of gene co-expression networks for ion channels and transmitter receptors.",

    "abstract": "The successful elimination of bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae from a host involves the coordination between different parts of the immune system. Previous studies have explored the effects of the initial pneumococcal load (bacterial dose) on different representations of innate immunity, finding that pathogenic outcomes can vary with the size of the bacterial dose. However, others yield support to the notion of dose-independent factors contributing to bacterial clearance. In this paper, we seek to provide a deeper understanding of the immune responses associated to the pneumococcus. To this end, we formulate a model that realizes an abstraction of the innate-regulatory immune host response. Stability and bifurcation analyses of the model reveal the following trichotomy of pneumococcal outcomes determined by the bifurcation parameters: (i) dose-independent clearance; (ii) dose-independent persistence; and (iii) dose-limited clearance. Bistability, where the bacteria-free equilibrium co-stabilizes with the most substantial steady-state bacterial load is the specific result behind dose-limited clearance. The trichotomy of pneumococcal outcomes here described integrates all previously observed bacterial fates into a unified framework.",

    "abstract": "Axon pruning is critical for the proper synapse elimination required for sculpting precise neural circuits. Though axon pruning has been described in the literature for decades, relatively little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern axon pruning in vivo. Here, we show that the epigenetic reader Kismet (Kis) binds to cisregulatory elements of the steroid hormone receptor Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) gene in Drosophila neurons. Kis is required to activate EcR transcription at these elements and promote H3K36 di- and tri-methylation and H4K16 acetylation. We show that exogenous EcR can rescue axon pruning and memory defects associated with loss of Kis, and that the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA can rescue these phenotypes. EcR protein abundance is a cell-autonomous, rate-limiting step required to initiate axon pruning in Drosophila, and our data suggests that this step is under epigenetic control.\\n\\nHighlights (bullet points up to 4)O_LIThe chromodomain reader Kismet activates transcription of the steroid hormone receptor EcR-B1 in the Drosophila to initiate developmental axon pruning.\\nC_LIO_LIKismet promotes H3K36 di- and tri-methylation and H4K16 acetylation at the EcR locus and upstream cis-regulatory sites.\\nC_LIO_LIAxon pruning and memory defects associated with loss of Kismet are significantly rescued by general HDAC inhibition.\\nC_LI",

As network analysis and image processing are based on matrices, this research analysed the changes in the chromatin image of lymphocyte nuclei in peripheral blood of humans using a network motif and static features (static parameters), so as to complete image classification with network method.\\n\\nMethods: Image processing technology was used to establish a chromatin image network of a cell nucleus; Network analysis tool Pajek was used to display the special motif of an isolated structural hole with different symmetric line values; afterwards, the frequency of occurrence of this structural hole in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and AIDS, and healthy people was computed.

Similarly, The static features of the chromatin image network of a cell nucleus were applied to classify and recognise the morphological and structural changes in chromatins for peripheral blood lymphocytes in the three groups of people.\\n\\nConclusion: The surface chemical and physical characteristics, as well as the polymerisation link status of biomacromolecules such as DNA, RNA, and protein in the lymphocyte nucleus change under certain pathological conditions. The change influences the combination of small molecular staining materials and any associated biomacromolecules. Therefore, various macroscopic and microscopic changes were found in the chromatin images of the cell nucleus. The microscopic changes include the variations of the extent of staining of chromatin in the nuclei, coarseness and direction of the texture therein, the size of stained conglomerations, etc. These changes contribute to the differences in chromatin image networks among the same type of cells across the three groups. Based on this, the model can be used to classify and reorganise certain diseases. The results prove that using complex network to analyse the chromatin structure of a cell nucleus is of significance.",

Metastatic STS have very bad prognosis due to the lack of effective treatments. Dinaciclib is a model drug for the family of CDK inhibitors. Its main targets are cell cycle regulator CDK1 and protein synthesis controller CDK9. We present data supporting Dinaciclib ability to inactivate in vitro different STS models at nanomolar concentrations. Moreover, the different rhythms of cell death induction allow us to further study into the mechanism of action of the drug. Cell death was found to respond to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL was identified as the key regulator of this process. Bcl-xL showed a slower decay curve after protein synthesis disruption that in tolerant cell lines was enough to delay apoptosis, as its action cannot be countered by the relative low levels of pro-apoptotic BH3 proteins BIM and PUMA. Combination of Dinaciclib with BH3-mimetics led to quick and massive apoptosis induction in vitro, but in vivo assessment was prevented due to liver toxicity. Additionally, Bcl-xL inhibitor A-1331852 also synergized with conventional chemotherapy drugs as Gemcitabine. Thus, Bcl-xL targeted therapy arises as a major opportunity to the treatment of STS.",

    "abstract": "The ability to distinguish between pathogens is a fundamental requirement to understand the epidemiology of infectious diseases. Phylogenetic analysis of genomic data can provide a powerful platform to identify lineages within bacterial populations, and thus inform outbreak investigation and transmission dynamics. However, resolving differences between pathogens associated with low variant (LV) populations carrying low median pairwise single nucleotide variant (SNV) distances, remains a major challenge. Here we present rPinecone, an R package designed to define sub-lineages within closely related LV populations. rPinecone uses a root-to-tip directional approach to define sub-lineages within a phylogenetic tree according to SNV distance from the ancestral node. The utility of this program was demonstrated using genomic data of two LV populations: a hospital outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and endemic Salmonella Typhi from rural Cambodia. rPinecone identified the transmission branches of the hospital outbreak and geographically-confined lineages in Cambodia. Sub-lineages identified by rPinecone in both analyses were phylogenetically robust. It is anticipated that rPinecone can be used to discriminate between lineages of bacteria from LV populations where other methods fail, enabling a deeper understanding of infectious disease epidemiology for public health purposes.\\n\\nDATA SUMMARYO_LISource code for rPinecone is available on GitHub under the open source licence GNU GPL 3; (url: https://github.com/alexwailan/rpinecone).\\nC_LIO_LINewick format files for both phylogenetic trees have been deposited in Figshare; (url: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7022558)\\nC_LIO_LIGeographical analysis of the S.

However, distinguishing bacterial species which are both very similar and which are likely to come from a small geographical and temporal range presents a major technical challenge for epidemiologists. rPinecone was designed to address this challenge and utilises phylogenetic data to define lineages within bacterial populations that have limited variation. This approach is therefore of great interest to epidemiologists as it adds a further level of clarity above and beyond that which is offered by existing approaches which have not been designed to consider bacterial isolates containing variation that only transiently exist, but which is epidemiologically informative. rPinecone has the flexibility to be applied to multiple pathogens and has direct application for investigations of clinical outbreaks and endemic disease to understand transmission dynamics or geographical hotspots of disease.",

    "abstract": "The persistence of several warning signals in sympatry is a puzzling evolutionary question because selection favours convergence of colour patterns among toxic species. Such convergence is shaped by predators reaction to similar but not identical stimulus, i.e. generalisation behaviour. However, studying generalisation behaviour in complex natural communities of predators is challenging, and is thus generally limited to simple variations of prey colour patterns. Here, we used humans as surrogate predators to investigate generalisation behaviours on two prey communities with different level of warning signals complexity. Humans generalisation capacities were estimated using a computer game simulating a simple (4 morphs) and a complex (10 morphs) community of defended (associated with a penalty) and palatable butterflies. Colour patterns used in the game are actually observed in natural populations of the defended butterflies H. numata, and generalisation behaviour of natural predators communities on these colour patterns have previously been investigated in the wild, allowing direct comparison with human behaviour. We investigated human predation behaviour by recording attack rates on the different defended and palatable colour patterns, as well as player survival time (i.e. score). Phenotypic similarity among the different colour patterns was precisely quantified using a custom algorithm accounting for both colour and pattern variations (CPM method). By analysing attack behaviours of 491 game players, we found that learning was more efficient in the simple prey community. Additionally, profitable prey gained protection from sharing key visual features with unprofitable prey in both communities while learning, in accordance with natural predator behaviours. Moreover, other behaviours observed in natural predators, such as colour neophobia, were detected in humans and shaped morph vulnerability during the game. Similarities between our results in humans and the reaction of natural predator communities to the same colour patterns validate our video-game as a useful proxy to study predator behaviour. This experimental set-up can thus be compared to natural systems, enabling further investigations of generalisation on mimicry evolution.",

The biomolecular machinery behind unjamming, its physiological and clinical relevance remain, however, a mystery. Here, we combine biophysical and biochemical analysis to study unjamming in a variety of epithelial 2D and 3D collectives: monolayers, differentiated normal mammary cysts, spheroid models of breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and ex vivo slices of orthotopically-implanted DCIS. In all cases, elevation of the small GTPase RAB5A sparks unjamming by promoting non-clathrin-dependent internalization of epidermal growth factor receptor that leads to hyper-activation of endosomally-confined ERK1/2 and phosphorylation of the actin nucleator WAVE2. Physically, activation of this pathway causes highly coordinated flocking of the cells, with striking rotational motion in 3D that eventually leads to matrix remodelling and collective invasiveness of otherwise jammed carcinoma. The identified endo-ERK1/2 pathway provides an effective switch for unjamming through flocking to promote epithelial tissues morphogenesis and carcinoma invasion and dissemination.",

    "abstract": "Growth rate and yield are fundamental features of micro-bial growth. However, we lack a mechanistic and quantita-tive understanding of the rate-yield relationship. Studies pairing computational predictions with experiments have shown the importance of maintenance energy and proteome allocation in explaining rate-yield tradeoffs and overflow metabolism. Recently, adaptive evolution experiments of Es-cherichia coli reveal a phenotypic diversity beyond what has been explained using simple models of growth rate versus yield. Here, we identify a two-dimensional rate-yield trade-off in adapted E. coli strains where the dimensions are (A) a tradeoff between growth rate and yield and (B) a tradeoff between substrate (glucose) uptake rate and growth yield. We employ a multi-scale modeling approach, combining a previously reported coarse-grained small-scale proteome allocation model with a fine-grained genome-scale model of metabolism and gene expression (ME-model), to develop a quantitative description of the full rate-yield relationship for E. coli K-12 MG1655. The multi-scale analysis resolves the complexity of ME-model which hindered its practical use in proteome complexity analysis, and provides a mecha-nistic explanation of the two-dimensional tradeoff. Further, the analysis identifies modifications to the P/O ratio and the flux allocation between glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway as potential mechanisms that enable the tradeoff between glucose uptake rate and growth yield. Thus, the rate-yield tradeoffs that govern microbial adaptation to new environments are more complex than previously reported, and they can be understood in mechanistic detail using a multi-scale modeling approach.",

    "abstract": "Humans and other animals are able to discover underlying statistical structure in their environments and exploit it to achieve efficient and effective performance. However, such structure is often difficult to learn and use because it is obscure, involving long-range temporal dependencies. Here, we analysed behavioural data from an extended experiment with rats, showing that the subjects learned the underlying statistical structure, albeit suffering at times from immediate inferential imperfections as to their current state within it. We accounted for their behaviour using a Hidden Markov Model, in which recent observations are integrated with the recollections of an imperfect memory. We found that over the course of training, subjects came to track their progress through the task more accurately, a change that our model largely attributed to decreased forgetting. This  learning to remember decreased reliance on recent observations, which may be misleading, in favour of a longer-term memory.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHumans and other animals possess the remarkable ability to find and exploit patterns and structures in their experience of a complex and varied world. However, such structures are often temporally extended and latent or hidden, being only partially correlated with immediate observations of the world. This makes it essential to integrate current and historical information, and creates a challenging statistical and computational problem.\\n\\nHere, we examine the behaviour of rats facing a version of this challenge posed by a brain-stimulation reward task. We find that subjects learned the general structure of the task, but struggled when immediate observations were misleading. We captured this behaviour with a model in which subjects integrated evidence from their observations together with a memory whose imperfections accounted for their errors.\\n\\nThe subjects performance improved markedly over successive sessions, allowing them to overcome misleading observations. According to the model, this arose from a process of  learning to remember in which subjects became better at employing more reliable past observations to determine the hidden state of the world.",

    "abstract": "Hox genes are conserved transcription factor-encoding genes that specify the identity of body regions in bilaterally symmetrical animals. In the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus, a member of the hemimetabolous insect group Orthoptera, the induction of a subset of mesodermal cells to form the primordial germ cells (PGCs) is restricted to the second through the fourth abdominal segments (A2-A4). In numerous insect species, the Hox genes Sex-combs reduced (Scr), Antennapedia (Antp), Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and abdominal-A (abd-A) jointly regulate the identities of middle and posterior body segments, suggesting that these genes may restrict PGC formation to specific abdominal segments in G. bimaculatus. Here we show that all of these Hox genes, either individually or in segment-specific combinations, restrict PGC formation. Our data provides evidence for a segmental Hox code used to regulate the placement of PGC formation, reminiscent of the segmental Hox codes used in other arthropod groups to establish other aspects of segmental identity. These data also provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence for this ancient group of genes in determining PGC placement within the context of axial patterning in any animal studied thus far.",

    "abstract": "Efforts to map the functional architecture of the developing human brain have shown that connectivity between and within functional neural networks changes from childhood to adulthood. While prior work has established that the adult precuneus distinctively modifies its connectivity during task versus rest states (Utevsky, Smith, & Huettel, 2014), it remains unknown how these connectivity patterns emerge over development. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected at two longitudinal timepoints from over 250 participants between the ages of 8 and 26 engaging in two cognitive tasks and a resting-state scan. By applying independent component analysis (ICA) to both task and rest data, we identified three canonical networks of interest - the rest-based default mode network (DMN) and the task-based left and right frontoparietal networks (LFPN, RFPN) - which we explored for developmental changes using dual-regression analyses. We found systematic state-dependent functional connectivity in the precuneus, such that engaging in a task (compared to rest) resulted in greater precuneus-LFPN and precuneus-RFPN connectivity, whereas being at rest (compared to task) resulted in greater precuneus-DMN connectivity. These cross-sectional results replicated across both tasks and at both developmental timepoints. Finally, we used longitudinal mixed models to show that the degree to which precuneus distinguishes between task and rest states increases with age, due to age-related increasing segregation between precuneus and LFPN at rest. Our results highlight the distinct role of the precuneus in tracking processing state, in a manner that is both present throughout and strengthened across development.",

    "abstract": "Cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) networks are critical for adaptive decision-making, yet how changes to circuit-level properties impact cognitive algorithms remains unclear. Here we explore how dopaminergic plasticity at corticostriatal synapses alters competition between striatal pathways, impacting the evidence accumulation process during decision-making. Spike-timing dependent plasticity simulations showed that dopaminergic feedback based on rewards modified the ratio of direct and indirect corticostriatal weights within opposing action channels. Using the learned weight ratios in a full spiking CBGT network model, we simulated neural dynamics and decision outcomes in a reward-driven decision task and fit them with a drift diffusion model. Fits revealed that the rate of evidence accumulation varied with inter-channel differences in direct pathway activity while boundary height varied with overall indirect pathway activity. This multi-level modeling approach demonstrates how complementary learning and decision computations can emerge from corticostriatal plasticity.\n\nAuthor summaryCognitive process models such as reinforcement learning (RL) and the drift diffusion model (DDM) have helped to elucidate the basic algorithms underlying error-corrective learning and the evaluation of accumulating decision evidence leading up to a choice. While these relatively abstract models help to guide experimental and theoretical probes into associated phenomena, they remain uninformative about the actual physical mechanics by which learning and decision algorithms are carried out in a neurobiological substrate during adaptive choice behavior. Here we present an \"upwards mapping\" approach to bridging neural and cognitive models of value-based decision-making, showing how dopaminergic feedback alters the network-level dynamics of cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) pathways during learning to bias behavioral choice towards more rewarding actions. By mapping \"up\" the levels of analysis, this approach yields specific predictions about aspects of neuronal activity that map to the quantities appearing in the cognitive decision-making framework.",

In this study, we investigate the cumulative effects of the short-term inverse occlusion in adults and old children with amblyopia. A prospective cohort study of 18 amblyopes (10-35 years old; 3 with strabismus) who have been subjected to 2 hours/day of inverse occlusion for 2 months. Patients who required refractive correction or whose refractive correction needed updating were given a 2-month period of refractive adaptation. The primary outcome measure was the binocular balance which was measured using a phase combination task, the secondary outcome measures were the best corrected visual acuity which was measured with a Tumbling E acuity chart and convert to logMAR units and the stereo acuity which was measured with the Random-dot preschool stereotest. The averaged binocular gain was 0.11 in terms of the effective contrast ratio (z = -2.344, p = 0.019, 2-tailed Related samples Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test). The average acuity gain was 0.14 logMAR equivalent (t(17) = 0.13, p < 0.001, 2-tailed paired samples t-test). The averaged stereo acuity gain was 253 arc seconds (z = -2.689, p = 0.007). Based on more recent research concerning adult ocular dominance plasticity, contrary to current practice, patching the amblyopic eye makes more sense; comparable acuity benefits, better compliance, better binocular outcome and applicable to adults as well as old children.",

Here we have taken a different approach by combining expectancy effects with intranasal oxytocin as an adjunct given previous evidence that it may enhance placebo effects. In a randomised controlled clinical trial we demonstrate that while working memory performance is not influenced by expectancy per se when it is given in conjunction with oxytocin performance in terms of accuracy can be significantly enhanced following positive expectancy induction (placebo effect) and impaired following negative expectancy induction (nocebo effect). Thus combining expectancy effects with intranasal oxytocin may represent a radical new approach for improving working memory function in mental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Previous evidence suggests that select nitrile and epithionitrile derivatives of glucosinolates can cause liver disease in cows grazing on brassica forage crops. A toxic incidence in New Zealand in cattle grazing brassica led us to investigate the direct in vitro hepatotoxicity and possible inhibition of the ABCG2 transporter of five nitrile compounds. In this study, we investigated 1-cyano-2-hydroxy-3-butene (CHB, epithionitrile derivative of progoitrin), 1-cyano-2-hydroxy-3,4-epithiobutane (CHEB, nitrile derivative of progoitrin), 3-butenenitrile (nitrile from sinigrin), 4-pentenenitrile (nitrile from gluconapin), and 5-hexenenitrile (nitrile from glucobrassicanapin). Cell viability was assessed following 24- and 72-hr treatments with the 5 different compounds using the MTT assay (HepG2 cells and bovine primary liver cells). Additionally, ABCG2 transporter function was assessed. The results showed that none of the tested compounds caused cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 2 mM for 24hr. Over 72-hr the maximum concentration was 20 M but no reduction in cell viability was observed. No inhibition of the ABCG2 transporter occured at concentrations up to 1 mM. Overall this study suggests that direct or secondary toxicity due to selected nitrile or epithionitrile derivatives of these glucosinolates was not the cause of the toxic event in cattle.",

TBARS value, AV value and IV value reflected the various physicochemical indexes and lipid properties of Folium nelumbinis oil. Furthermore, antioxidant activities of the leaf samples were examined by FRAP and DPPH assays. In all systems, twice methanol-decolorized and ultrasonic-assisted essential oil using hexane solvent exhibited a higher potential activitythan than that of other extracts (ethanol, ethyl acetate and petroleum ether). These results provide a clear picture of the essential oils of Folium nelumbinis and demonstrate that the lotus leaves oil has an huge potential as a kind of chemical additive for the food industry owing to the strong antioxidant capacity.",

    "abstract": "Burkholderia pseudomallei causes melioidosis, a common source of pneumonia and sepsis in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, that results in high mortality rates. A caprine melioidosis model of aerosol infection that leads to a systemic infection has the potential to characterize the humoral immune response. This could help identify immunogenic proteins for new diagnostics and vaccine candidates. Outbred goats may more accurately mimic human infection, in contrast to the inbred mouse models used to date. B. pseudomallei infection was delivered as an intratracheal aerosol. Antigenic protein profiling was generated from the infecting strain MSHR511. Humoral immune responses were analyzed by ELISA and western blot, and the antigenic proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Throughout the course of the infection the assay results demonstrated a much greater humoral response with IgG antibodies, in both breadth and quantity, compared to IgM antibodies. Pre-infection sera showed multiple immunogenic proteins already reactive for IgG (7-20) and IgM (0-12) in most of the goats despite no previous exposure to B. pseudomallei. After infection, the number of IgG reactive proteins showed a marked increase as the disease progressed. Early stage infection (day 7) showed immune reaction to chaperone proteins (GroEL, EF-Tu, and DnaK). These three proteins were detected in all serum samples after infection, with GroEL immunogenically dominant. Seven common reactive antigens were selected for further analysis using ELISA. The heat shock protein GroEL1 elicited the strongest goat antibody immune response compared to the other six antigens. Most of the six antigens showed the peak IgM reactivity at day 14, whereas the IgG reactivity increased further as the disease progressed. An overall MSHR511 proteomic comparison between the goat model and human sera showed that many immune reactive proteins are common between humans and goats with melioidosis.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryB. pseudomallei infection, the causative agent of melioidosis, results in severe disseminated or localized infections. A systemic study of the humoral immune response to B. pseudomallei infection using the B. pseudomallei aerosol caprine model would help understand the detectable antigenic proteins as the infection progresses. To study the immune response, IgG and IgM antibody responses to whole cell lysate proteins were identified and analyzed. Antigenic carbohydrates were also studied. From the results, this study suggests that the caprine humoral immune response to aerosolized B. pseudomallei has similarities to human melioidosis and may facilitate the analysis of the temporal antibody responses. In addition, commonly detected immunogenic proteins may be used as biomarkers for the future point of care (POC) diagnostics.",

There are multiple factors that contribute to selecting for the microbiome, key of which are host genetics. Flavobacterium psychrophillum, the causative agent of Bacterial Cold Water Disease in salmonids, accounts for acute losses in wild and farmed Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The U.S. National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture has used family-based selective breeding to generate a line of rainbow trout with enhanced resistance to F. psychrophilum. The goal of this study is to determine whether selective breeding impacts the gut and gill microbiome of the F. psychrophilum-resistant as compared to a background matched susceptible trout line. Mid-gut and gill samples were collected from juvenile fish (mean bwt 118g) and microbial diversity assessed by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Results indicate that alpha diversity was significantly higher in the mid-gut of the susceptible line compared to the resistant line, while no significant differences in alpha diversity were observed in the gills. Mycoplasma sp. was the dominant taxon in the mid-gut of both groups, although it was present at a decreased abundance in the susceptible line. We also observed an increased abundance of taxa that could potentially be pathogenic in the susceptible line, including Brevinema sp. and Enterobacteriaceae members. Within the gills, both lines exhibited similar microbial profiles, with Candidatus Branchiomonas being the dominant taxon. Together, these results suggest that selectively bred Flavobacterium psychrophillum-resistant trout may harness a more resilient gut microbiome, attributing to the disease resistant phenotype, providing a framework for future experiments.",

    "abstract": "When we think of our family and friends, we probably know someone who is good at finding their way and someone else that easily get lost. We still know little about the biological and environmental factors that influence our navigational ability. Here, we investigated the frequency and sociodemographic determinants of wayfinding and their association with vestibular function in a representative cross-sectional sample (N = 783) of the adult German-speaking population. Wayfinding was assessed using the Wayfinding Strategy Scale, a self-report scale that produces two scores for each participant representing to what degree they rely on route-based or orientation (map-based) strategies. We were interested in the following research questions: (1) the frequency and determinants of wayfinding strategies in a population-based representative sample, (2) the relationship between vestibular function and strategy choice and (3) how sociodemographic factors influence general wayfinding ability as measured using a combined score from both strategy scores. Our linear regression models showed that being male, having a higher education, higher age and lower regional urbanization increased orientation strategy scores. Vertigo/dizziness reduced the scores of both the orientation and the route strategies. Using a novel approach, we grouped participants by their combined strategy scores in a multinomial regression model, to see whether individuals prefer one strategy over the other. The majority of individuals reported using either both or no strategy, instead of preferring one strategy over the other. Young age and reduced vestibular function were indicative of using no strategy. In summary, wayfinding ability depends on both biological and environmental factors; all sociodemographic factors except income. Over a third of the population, predominantly under the age of 35, does not successfully use either strategy. This represents a change in our wayfinding skills, which may result from the technological advances in navigational aids over the last few decades.",

We modified one allele of the normal APP locus to directly express a secretory form of A{beta}40 or A{beta}42, eliminating the need for amyloidogenic APP proteolysis. Following neuronal differentiation edited cell lines specifically accumulate aggregated/oligomeric A{beta}, exhibit a synaptic deficit and have an abnormal accumulation of endolysosomal vesicles. Edited cultures progress to a stage of overt ND. All phenotypes appear at earlier culture times for A{beta}42 relative to A{beta}40. Whole transcriptome RNA-Seq analysis identified 23 up and 70 down regulated genes (DEGs) with similar directional fold change but larger absolute values in the A{beta}42 samples suggesting common underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Pathway/annotation analysis suggested that down regulation of extracellular matrix and cilia functions are significantly overrepresented. This cellular model could be useful for uncovering mechanisms directly linking A{beta} to neuronal death and as a tool to screen for new therapeutic agents that slow or prevent human ND.",

Documented behaviours include the snails speed of movement, thrusting their heads down into leaf litter to wait in ambush for prey, the daily retreat into lairs, burrowing, and the grooming of the snails shell. The most significant environmental factors affecting the presence of the snails were humidity and wind direction. There was a migration of snails into and out of the observable study area at different times of year. Due to the snails pace of 1.9 to 3 m/hr relative to its prey at 5-10m/hr the snails would need to migrate to and inhabit areas where there is likely to be trackable prey. Overall the observations indicate the hunting strategy of a periodically active ambush predator sometimes based in a lair and migrating to suitably humid and windless areas as needed to allow tracking of their prey.",

    "abstract": "Background aimsDelaying replicative senescence and extending lifespan of human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may enhance their potential for tissue engineering and cell based therapies. Accumulating evidence suggests that inhibitors of the mTOR signaling pathway, such as rapamycin, constitute promising pharmacological agents to retard senescence and extend stemness properties of various progenitor cell types. Here, we investigated whether the ability of rapamycin to postpone replicative senescence varies among bone marrow MSC samples (BM-MSCs) derived from different healthy donors, and explored the molecular mechanisms that drive rapamycin-mediated lifespan increment.\\n\\nMethodsBM-MSCs at early passages were serially passaged either in absence or continuous presence of rapamycin and the number of cell population doublings until growth arrest was measured. The inhibition of mTOR signaling was assessed by the phosphorylation status of the downstream target RPS6. The expression levels of several senescence and pluripotency markers at early and late/senescent passages were analyzed by RT-qPCR, flow cytometry and western blot.\\n\\nResultsWe found that the lifespan extension in response to the continuous rapamycin treatment was highly variable among samples, but effective in most BM-MSCs. Despite all rapamycin-treated cells secreted significantly reduced levels of IL6, a major SASP cytokine, and expressed significantly higher levels of the pluripotency marker NANOG, the expression patterns of these markers were not correlated with the rapamycin-mediated increase in lifespan. Interestingly, rapamycin-mediated life-span extension was significantly associated only with repression of p16INK4A protein accumulation.\\n\\nConclusionsTaken together, our results suggest that some, but not all, BM-MSC samples would benefit from using rapamycin to postpone replicative arrest and reinforce a critical role of p16INK4A protein downregulation in this process.",

    "abstract": "During Schistosoma infection, lack of B cells results in more severe granulomas, inflammation, and fibrosis in the liver, but the mechanisms underlying this pathology remain unclear. Thus, our aim was to clarify the mechanisms underpinning the immunomodulation of B cells in mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum. We found that B cell deficiency led to aggravated liver pathology, as demonstrated by increases in the size of the egg-associated granulomas, alanine transaminase levels, and collagen deposition. Compared with infected wild-type mice, infected B cell-deficient MT mice showed increased infiltration of Ly6Chi monocytes and higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, and interleukin 12) and chemokines ([C-C motif] ligands (CCL)2, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5). The results of flow cytometric analysis and cell transfer experiments showed that B1a cells increased significantly in the liver following S. japonicum infection, with some of those cells deriving from the peritoneal cavity. We also found that secretion of IL-10 from hepatic B cells increased significantly in infected wild-type mice and that this IL-10 was mainly derived from B1a cells. In addition, adoptively transferring peritoneal cavity B cells purified from wild-type, but not from IL-10-deficient mice, to MT mice significantly reduced liver pathology and liver infiltration of Ly6Chi monocytes. These reductions were accompanied by decreases in the expression levels of chemokines and inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, these data indicated that after S. japonicum infection, an increased number of hepatic B1a cells secrete IL-10, which inhibits the expression of chemokines and cytokines and suppresses the infiltration of Ly6Chi monocytes into the liver thereby alleviating liver early inflammation and late fibrosis. Understanding this immunomodulatory role of B1a cells in schistosomiasis may lead to the development of therapeutic strategies for Schistosoma-induced liver disease.\\n\\nAuthor summaryInfection with Schistosoma, a waterborne parasitic flatworm (trematode) commonly called a blood fluke, results in strong granulomatous inflammation caused by the deposition of eggs in the liver. A granuloma is a substantial immune cell infiltration around the eggs intermixed with liver cells that can protect the host against liver damage. However, excessive infiltration and inflammation can lead to severe liver injury and fibrosis. Here, we found that B1a cells accumulate in the liver of mice after S. japonicum-induced infection and that these B1a cells release the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 to regulate inflammation. The B1a cell-derived interleukin 10 inhibits the expression of chemokines (which attract cells such as monocytes to sites of infection or inflammation) and thus restrains excessive infiltration of Ly6Chi monocytes (which may have proinflammatory activity) into the liver, thereby alleviating early inflammation and later fibrosis. Our study provides insight into the immunomodulation of B1a cells in schistosomiasis and offers key information for the development of therapeutic strategies in Schistosoma-induced liver disease.",

Host erythrocytes are modified by hundreds of effectors proteins exported from the parasites into the host cell. Protein export is mediated by the PTEX translocon comprising five core components of which EXP2 is considered to form the putative pore that spans the vacuole membrane enveloping the parasite within its erythrocyte. To explore the function and importance of EXP2 for parasite survival in the asexual blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum we inducibly knocked down the expression of EXP2. Reduction in EXP2 expression strongly reduced parasite growth proportional to the degree of protein knockdown and tended to stall development about half way through the asexual cell cycle. Once the knockdown inducer was removed and EXP2 expression restored, parasite growth recovered dependent upon the length and degree of knockdown. To establish EXP2 function and hence the basis for growth reduction, the trafficking of an exported protein was monitored following EXP2 knockdown. This resulted in severe attenuation of protein export and is consistent with EXP2, and PTEX in general, being the conduit for export of proteins into the host compartment.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular parasites of the genus Leishmania are the causative agents of human leishmaniasis, a widespread emergent tropical disease. The parasite is transmitted by the bite of a hematophagous sandfly vector that inoculates motile flagellated promastigote forms into the dermis of the mammalian host. After inoculation, parasites are ultimately captured by macrophages and multiply as round-shaped amastigote forms. Macrophages seem not to be the first infected cells since parasites were observed invading neutrophils first whose leishmania-containing apoptotic bodies were latter captured by macrophages, thereby becoming infected. The fact that Leishmania spp are able to live and replicate inside immune phagocytic cells and that macrophages are the main cell type found infected in chronicity created the perception that Leishmania spp are passive players waiting to be captured by phagocytes. However, several groups have described the infection of non-phagocytic cells in vivo and in vitro. The objective of this work was to study the cellular mechanisms involved in the invasion of non-professional phagocytes by Leishmania. We show that promastigotes of L.amazonensis actively induces invasion in fibroblasts without cytoskeleton activity, thus by a mechanism that is distinct from phagocytosis. Inside fibroblasts parasites transformed in amastigotes, remained viable for at least two weeks and re-transformed in promastigotes when returned to insect vector conditions. Similarly to what was observed for T. cruzi, infection involves calcium signaling, recruitment and exocytosis of lysosomes involved in plasma membrane repair and lysosome-triggered endocytosis. Conditions that alter lysosomal function such as cytochalasin-D and brefeldin-A treatment or the knockout of host cell lysosomal proteins LAMP-1 and 2 dramatically affected invasion. Likewise, triggering of lysosomal exocytosis and lysosome-dependent plasma membrane repair by low doses of streptolysin-O dramatically increased parasite entry. Together our results show that L.amazonensis promastigotes are able to take advantage of calcium-dependent lysosomal exocytosis and lysosome-induced endocytosis to invade and persist in non-phagocytic cells.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIntracellular parasites of the genus Leishmania are the causative agents of leishmaniasis. The disease is transmitted by the bite of a sand fly vector which inoculates the parasite into the skin of mammalian hosts, including humans. During chronic infection the parasite lives and replicates inside phagocytic cells, notably the macrophages. An interesting but overlooked finding on Leishmania infection is that non-phagocytic cells have also been found infected by amastigotes. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which Leishmania invades non-phagocytic cells were not studied to date. Here we show that L. amazonensis can actively induce their own entry into fibroblasts independently of actin cytoskeleton activity, thus by a mechanism that is distinct from phagocytosis. Invasion involves subversion of host cell functions such as calcium signaling and recruitment and exocytosis of host cell lysosomes involved in plasma membrane repair and whose positioning and content interfere in invasion. Parasites were able to replicate and remained viable in fibroblasts, suggesting that cell invasion trough the mechanism demonstrated here could serve as a parasite hideout and reservoir, facilitating infection amplification and persistence.",

    "abstract": "In 2015, we successfully isolated a strain of duck-origin parvovirus from Cherry Valley ducks, which we named QH-L01. In this study, duck-origin parvovirus in Cherry Valley ducks was quantified and localized by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), and pathological damage to the tissues and organs was observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE staining). qPCR showed that the viral load was higher in the spleen, brain, lung, cecum, ileum, and duodenum over time. The results from IHC experiments showed positive reactions in hepatocytes, epithelium of the lung atrium, myocardial cells, goblet cells of the intestine, and brain cells. Primary histological examination revealed pulmonary lobule depletion and dilation in the lung as well as necrosis and erosion of the villus tips in the duodenum, ileum and cecum. This study is the first demonstration that duck-origin parvovirus can be transmitted from the spleen to the brain and lung, resulting in proliferation and dissemination of the virus to the cecum, ileum, duodenum and other tissues through the blood. The lung, duodenum, ileum and cecum may thus represent the main target tissues and organs for duck-origin parvovirus.",

    "abstract": "The study of biodiversity spatial patterns along ecological gradients can serve to elucidate factors shaping biological community structure and predict ecosystem responses to global change. Ant assemblages are particularly interesting as study cases, because ant species play a key role in many ecosystem processes and have frequently been identified as useful bioindicators. Here we analyzed the response of ant species richness and assemblage composition to elevational gradients in Mediterranean grasslands and subsequently tested whether these responses were stable spatially and temporally. We sampled ant assemblages in two years (2014, 2015) in two mountain ranges (Guadarrama, Serrota) in Central Spain, along an elevational gradient ranging from 685 to 2390 m a.s.l.\\n\\nJackknife estimates of ant species richness ranged from three to 18.5 species and exhibited a hump-shaped relationship with elevation that peaked at mid range values (1100 - 1400 m). This pattern was transferable temporally and spatially. Elevation was significantly related to ant assemblage composition and facilitated separation of higher elevation assemblages (> 1700 m) from the remaining lower elevation species groups. Ant assemblages were nested; therefore species assemblages with a decreased number of species were a subset of the richer assemblages, although species turnover was more important than pure nestedness in all surveys. The degree of nestedness changed non-linearly as a cubic polynomial with elevation. These assembly patterns were observed over time but not between the two study regions.\\n\\nWe concluded double environmental stressors typical of Mediterranean mountains explained species richness patterns: drought at low elevations and cold temperatures at high elevations likely constrained richness at both extremes of elevational gradients. The fact that species turnover showed a dominant role over pure nestedness suggested current ant assemblages were context-dependent (spatio-temporal factors) and highly vulnerable to global change, which threatens the conservation of present day native ant communities, particularly at high elevations.",

    "abstract": "Brain asymmetry is inherent to cognitive processing and seems to reflect processing efficiency. Lower frontal asymmetry is often observed in older adults during memory retrieval, yet it is unclear whether lower asymmetry implies an age-related increase in contralateral recruitment, whether less asymmetry reflects compensation, is limited to frontal regions, or predicts neurocognitive stability or decline. We assessed age-differences in asymmetry across the entire cerebral cortex, using fMRI data from 89 young and 76 older adults during successful retrieval, and surface-based methods that allowed direct homotopic comparison of activity between hemispheres. An extensive left-asymmetric network facilitated retrieval in both young and older adults, whereas diverse frontal and parietal regions exhibited lower asymmetry in older adults. However, lower asymmetry was not associated with age-related increases in contralateral recruitment, but primarily reflected either less deactivation in contralateral regions reliably signalling retrieval failure in the young, or lower recruitment of the dominant hemisphere--suggesting that functional deficits may drive lower asymmetry in older brains, not compensatory activity. Lower asymmetry neither predicted current memory performance, nor the extent of memory change across the preceding [~]8 years in older adults. Together, these findings are inconsistent with a compensation account for lower asymmetry during retrieval and aging.",

To address this issue, we designed a novel behavioural paradigm that allowed us to experimentally manipulate the structure of motor sequences representations in individual participants. We then conducted fMRI while participants executed 8 trained sequences to examine how this structure is reflected in the associated activity patterns. Both model-based and model-free approaches revealed a clear distinction between primary and non-primary motor cortices in their representational contents, with M1 specifically representing individual finger movements, and premotor and parietal cortices showing a mixture of chunk, sequence and finger transition representations. Using model-free representational parcellation, we could divide these non-primary motor cortices into separate clusters, each with a unique representation along the stimulus-to-action gradient. These results provide new insights into how human neocortex organizes movement sequences.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionInfections are responsible for up to 85% of deaths in patients with burn injuries. Proper management of infections in patients with burns requires knowledge of local microbial landscape and antimicrobial resistance patterns. Most burns units in low to middle income countries lack this data to guide patient management.\\n\\nMethods and resultsWe conducted a retrospective audit of adult ([&ge;]17 years) patient records admitted between at 1st June 2007 and May 2017 at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital Burns unit in Blantyre Malawi with an index complaint of burn injury. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed to determine antibiotic prescription patterns, microbial isolates and antimicrobial resistance patterns on the 500 patient files that met the inclusion criteria. Cephalosporins and Penicillins constituted 72.3% of the 328 antibiotic prescriptions given to 212 patients and 84% of all prescriptions were potentially inappropriate. A total of 102 bacterial isolates were identified and a majority (30.4%; n=31) were resistant to Aminoglycosides and Aminocyclitols (23.5%; n=24); seconded by Penicillins at 19.6% (n=20). Pseudomonas, staphylococcus and streptococcus species constituted 36.1%, 25% and 16.7% of all resistant bacteria that were isolated and they were thus the most common bacterial isolates. Drug resistance was more common among gram negative bacteria (48.8% versus 26.2%) and a greater proportion of patients (74.1%) that had antibiotic sensitivity testing were affected by drug resistant gram negative bacteria which appear on the World Health Organisation list of priority pathogens.\\n\\nConclusionThe results of our preliminary study point towards nosocomial gram negative bacteria which appear on the World Health Organisations list of priority pathogens as the more common sources of antibiotic resistance. This scenario is potentially driven by inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions as well as clinical and laboratory diagnostic imprecision in addition to the universally recognised post burn pathophysiological changes of hypermetabolism and immunosuppression. Improvements in the areas of antimicrobial stewardship, diagnostic capacity and burns related research are needed in order to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes and resource utilisation.",

Genome-wide sequencing data are potentially highly informative for reconstructing this demographic history. A crucial point is to extract the relevant information from these very large datasets. Here we designed an approach for inferring past demographic events from a moderate number of fully sequenced genomes. Our new approach uses Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a simulation-based statistical framework that allows (i) identifying the best demographic scenario among several competing scenarios, and (ii) estimating the best-fitting parameters under the chosen scenario. ABC relies on the computation of summary statistics. Using a cross-validation approach, we showed that statistics such as the lengths of haplotypes shared between individuals, or the decay of linkage disequilibrium with distance, can be combined with classical statistics (eg heterozygosity, Tajimas D) to accurately infer complex demographic scenarios including bottlenecks and expansion periods. We also demonstrated the importance of simultaneously estimating the genotyping error rate. Applying our method on genome-wide human-sequence databases, we finally showed that a model consisting in a bottleneck followed by a Paleolithic and a Neolithic expansion was the most relevant for Eurasian populations.",

How NDR and the precise positioning of the +1 nucleosome is maintained on active genes remains unclear. Here, we report that the Drosophila Non-Specific Lethal (NSL) complex is necessary to maintain this stereotypical nucleosomal organization at promoters. Upon NSL1 depletion, nucleosomes invade the NDRs at TSSs of NSL-bound genes. NSL complex member NSL3 binds to TATA-less promoters in a sequence-dependent manner. The NSL complex interacts with the NURF chromatin remodeling complex and is necessary and sufficient to recruit NURF to target promoters. The NSL complex is not only essential for transcription but is required for accurate TSS selection for genes with multiple TSSs. Further, loss of NSL complex leads to an increase in transcriptional noise. Thus, the NSL complex establishes a canonical nucleosomal organization that enables transcription and determines TSS fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Dominance is well defined in ethology, debated in psychology, and is often unclear among the dog owning public and in the press. However, to date, no study has examined how owners perceive dominance in dogs, and what different behaviours and personality types are used to describe dominant and subordinate individuals. A questionnaire study was launched to investigate the external validity of owner-derived estimates of dominance in dog dyads sharing the same household (N = 1151). According to the owners, dogs rated as dominant (87%) have priority access to resources (resting place, food, and rewards), undertake certain tasks (defend and lead the group, bark more), display dominance (win fights, lick the others mouth less, and mark over the others urine), share certain personality traits (smarter, more aggressive and impulsive), and are older than their partner dog (all p < 0.0001). An age-related hypothesis has been suggested to explain dominance in dogs, but we found that dog age did not explain the occurrence of dominance-related behaviours over the owners estimate of dominance status. Results suggest that owner-derived reports of dominance ranks of dogs living in multi-dog households correspond to ethologically valid behavioural markers of dominance. Size and physical condition were unrelated to the perceived dominance. Surprisingly, in mixed-sex dyads, females were more frequently rated as dominant than males, which might correspond to a higher proportion of neutered females in this subgroup. For future studies that wish to allocate dominance status using owner report, we offer a novel survey.",

    "abstract": "The plant genus Ficus is a keystone resource in tropical ecoystems. One of the unique features of figs is the diversity of fruit traits, which in many cases match their various dispersers, the so-called fruit syndromes. The classic example of this is the strong phenotypic differences found between figs with bat and bird dispersers (color, size, and presentation). The  bird-fig Ficus colubrinae represents an exception to this trend since it attracts the small frugivorous bat species Ectophylla alba at night, but during the day attracts bird visitors. Here we investigate the mechanism by which this  bird-fig attracts bats despite its fruit traits, which should appeal solely to birds. We performed feeding experiments with Ectophylla alba to assess the role of fruit scent in the detection of ripe fruits. Ectophylla alba was capable of finding ripe figs by scent alone under exclusion of other sensory cues. This suggests that scent is the main foraging cue for Ectophylla alba. Analyses of odor bouquets from the bat- and bird-dispersal phases (i.e. day and night) differed significantly in their composition of volatiles. The combination of these two findings raises the question whether E. alba and F. colubrinae resemble a co-adaptation that enables a phenotypically classic  bird-fig to attract bat dispersers by an olfactory signal at night thus maximizing dispersal.",

    "abstract": "Although, neuro-sensory systems might evolve independently in ctenophores, very little is known about their neural organization. Most of the ctenophores are pelagic and deep-water species and cannot be bred in the laboratory. Thus, it is not surprising that neuroanatomical data are available for only one genus within the group - Pleurobrachia. Here, using immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscopy, we describe the organization of two distinct neural subsystems (subepithelial and mesogleal) and the structure of different receptor types in the comb jelly Beroe abyssicola - the voracious predator from North Pacific. A complex subepithelial neural network of Beroe, with five receptor types, covers the entire body surface and expands deeply into the pharynx. Three types of mesogleal neurons are comparable to the cydippid Pleurobrachia. The predatory lifestyle of Beroe is supported by the extensive development of ciliated and muscular structures including the presence of giant muscles and feeding macrocilia. The obtained neuroanatomy atlas provides unique examples of lineage-specific innovations within these enigmatic marine animals, and remarkable complexity of sensory and effector systems in this clade of basal Metazoa.\\n\\nGraphical AbstractAlthough, neuro-sensory systems might evolve independently in ctenophores, very little is known about their neuroanatomy.

    "abstract": "The genome of flying birds, the smallest among amniotes, reflects overweight of the extensive DNA loss over the unrestricted proliferation of selfish genetic elements, resulted in a shortage of repeated sequences and lack of B-chromosomes. The only exception of this rule has been described in zebra finch, which possesses a large germ-line restricted chromosome (GRC), transmitted via oocytes, eliminated from male postmeiotic cells and absent in somatic cell. It is considered as a rarity and its origin, content and function remain unclear. We discovered that all songbirds possess GRC: in various size and genetic content it is present in all fifteen songbird species investigated and absent from germ-line genomes of all eight species of other bird orders examined. Our data based on fluorescent in situ hybridization of DNA probes derived from GRCs of four different Passeri species and their sequencing indicate that the GRCs show low homology between avian species. They contain fragments of the somatic genomes, which include various unique and repetitive sequences. We propose that the GRC has formed in the common ancestor of the extant songbirds and undergone subsequent divergence. GRC presence in the germ line of every songbird studied indicate that it could contain genetic element(s) indispensable for gametogenesis, which are yet to be discovered.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in genomics are producing powerful DNA predictors of complex traits, especially cognitive abilities. Here, we leveraged summary statistics from the most recent genome-wide association studies of intelligence and educational attainment to build prediction models of general cognitive ability and educational achievement. To this end, we compared the performances of multi-trait genomic and polygenic scoring methods. In a representative UK sample of 7,026 children at age 12 and 16, we show that we can now predict up to 11 percent of the variance in intelligence and 16 percent in educational achievement. We also show that predictive power increases from age 12 to age 16 and that genomic predictions do not differ for girls and boys. Multivariate genomic methods were effective in boosting predictive power and, even though prediction accuracy varied across polygenic scores approaches, results were similar using different multivariate and polygenic score methods. Polygenic scores for educational attainment and intelligence are the most powerful predictors in the behavioural sciences and exceed predictions that can be made from parental phenotypes such as educational attainment and occupational status.",

    "abstract": "Lipoate is an essential cofactor for key enzymes of oxidative and one-carbon metabolism. It is covalently attached to E2 subunits of dehydrogenase (DH) complexes and the GcvH subunit of the glycine cleavage system. Bacillus subtilis possess two protein lipoylation pathways: biosynthesis and scavenging. The former requires octanoylation of GcvH, amidotransfer of the octanoate to E2s, and insertion of sulfur atoms. Lipoate scavenging is mediated by a lipoate ligase (LplJ), that catalizes a classical two-step ATP-dependent reaction. Although these pathways were thought to be redundant, a {Delta}lipL mutant, unable to transfer the octanoyl group from GcvH to the E2s during lipoate synthesis, showed growth defects in minimal media even when supplemented with this cofactor, despite the presence of a functional LplJ. In this study we demonstrated that LipL is essential to modify E2 subunits of branched chain ketoacid and pyruvate DH during lipoate scavenging. LipL must be functional and it is not forming a complex with LplJ, which suggests that these enzymes might be acting sequentially. We also show that the E2 subunit of oxoglutarate DH is a good donor for LipL amidotransfer reaction. The essential role of LipL during lipoate utilization relies on the strict substrate specificity of LplJ, determined by charge complementarity between the ligase and the lipoylable subunits. LplJ does not recognize E2 subunits without a negatively charged residue in key positions of the target protein, and thus LipL is required to transfer the lipoate to them. This model of lipoate scavenging seems widespread among Gram-positive bacteria.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTransposon mutagenesis is highly valuable for bacterial genetic and genomic studies. The transposons are usually delivered into host cells through conjugation or electroporation of a suicide plasmid. However, many bacterial species cannot be efficiently conjugated or transformed for transposon saturation mutagenesis. For this reason, temperature-sensitive (ts) plasmids have also been developed for transposon mutagenesis, but prolonged incubation at high temperatures to induce ts plasmid loss can be harmful to the hosts and lead to enrichment of mutants with adaptive genetic changes. In addition, the ts phenotype of a plasmid is often strain- or species-specific, as it may become non-ts or suicidal in different bacterial species.\\n\\nResultsWe have engineered several conditional suicide plasmids that have a broad host range and whose loss is IPTG-controlled. One construct, which has the highest stability in the absence of IPTG induction, was then used as a curable vector to deliver hyperactive miniTn5 transposons for insertional mutagenesis. Our analyses show that these new tools can be used for efficient and regulatable transposon mutagenesis in Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baylyi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In P. aeruginosa PAO1, we have used this method to generate a Tn5 insertion library with an estimated diversity of ~108, which is ~2 logs larger than the best transposon insertional library of PAO1 and related Pseudomonas strains previously reported.\\n\\nConclusionWe have developed a number of IPTG-controlled conditional suicide plasmids. By exploiting one of them for transposon delivery, a highly efficient and broadly useful mutagenesis system has been developed. As the assay condition is mild, we believe that our methodology will have broad applications in microbiology research.",

Genetic networks to yield multistable states are usually required to yield multiple states, and either external stimuli or noise in gene expressions are trigger signals to induce cell-type switches between the states. In many biological systems, cells show highly plasticity and can switch between different state spontaneously, but maintaining the dynamic equilibrium of the cell population. Here, we considered a mechanism of spontaneous cell-type switches through the combination between gene regulation network and stochastic epigenetic state transitions. We presented a mathematical model that consists of a standard positive feedback loop with changes of histone modifications during with cell cycling. Based on the model, nucleosome state of an associated gene is a random process during cell cycling, and hence introduces an inherent noise to gene expression, which can automatically induce cell-type switches in cell cycling. Our model reveals a simple mechanism of spontaneous cell-type switches through a stochastic histone modification inheritance during cell cycle. This mechanism is inherent to the normal cell cycle process, and is independent to the external signals.",

Revisiting our previous analysis of resistance, we again find distinct mutational biases associated with random selection versus genome-scale libraries, along with pervasive pleiotropy among resistant mutants. Attempts to predict mutant phenotypes using machine learning identified the lack of comprehensive phenotype screening and small size of the Resistome corpus as challenges for effective model training. Overall, the Resistome represents a unique platform for understanding the interconnections between both current and future resistant mutants, and is available for use at https://resistome-web-interface.herokuapp.com.",

We provide compelling evidence that the lack of Hoxd13 transcription in the anterior mesoderm is due to increased Gli3R activity, in turn resulting from the loss of transcriptional repression exerted by Hoxa13 on Gli3. Our results are compatible with a mutual transcriptional repression between Gli3 and Hox13 genes that determines the anterior-posterior asymmetry of the autopod.",

Our data suggest that both the cortical components Dlg, Scrib, Lgl and the clathrin-mediated endocytic (CME) machinery downregulate EGFR signaling. Knockdown of dlg, scrib, lgl or CME components in cyst cells resulted in germ cell death, similar to increased signal transduction via the EGFR, while lowering EGFR or downstream signaling components rescued the defects.

Oxytocin administration resulted in men rating the faces of unfaithful women as more attractive but in women rating those of unfaithful men as less attractive and also finding them less memorable.

    "abstract": "Adult neurogenesis occurring in the brain of adult mammals is considered to have potential therapeutical applications. New neurons are produced constitutively from postnatal neural stem cells/precursors residing in two neurogenic regions: the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular layer in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Newly-generated neuroblasts from the SVZ migrate long distance towards the olfactory bulb and repopulate different subtypes of inhibitory interneurons modulating the olfactory processing. It was reported that cyclin D2 knockout mice (cD2-KO) present reduced generation of new hippocampal neurons, however proliferation deficiency and mechanisms responsible for dysregulation of subventricular precursors, derived progenitors, and olfactory interneurons need to be detaily investigated. In this report, proliferative activity of different subpopulations of SVZ neural precursors, cell migration, and differentiation in cD2-KO mice was characterized. For that goal, EdU, a thymidine analogue, proliferation mapping combined with multi-epitope immunohisto-chemical detection of endogenous stage-specific cell markers was carried out. Severely reduced number of newly-generated cells in the subventricular niche was demonstrated that was not accompanied by increased level of apoptotic death. Surprisingly, the number of B1 quiescent precursor subpopulation was not affected, whereas the number of B1 type active primary precursors, intermediate/transiently-amplifying progenitors (C type cells), and neuroblasts (A type cells) were reduced. The analyses suggest that cycline D2 might be critical for transition of B1 precursor quiescent cells into B1 active cells. We also demonstrate that the subpopulation of calbindin interneurons is reduced in the olfactory bulb. Deciphering processes underlying a potential modulation of intensity of adult neurogenesis at the cellular levels could lead to replacement therapies after injury, stroke, or neurodegenerative disease in the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "A quantitative description of the molecular networks that sustain morphogenesis is one of the challenges of developmental biology. Specifically, a molecular understanding of the segmentation of the antero-posterior axis in vertebrates has yet to be achieved. This process known as somitogenesis is believed to result from the interactions between a genetic oscillator and a posterior-moving determination wavefront. Here we quantitatively study and perturb the network in zebrafish that sustains this wavefront and compare our observations to a model whereby the wavefront is due to a switch between stable states resulting from reciprocal negative feedbacks of Retinoic Acid (RA) on the activation of ERK and of ERK on RA synthesis. This model quantitatively accounts for the near linear shortening of the post-somitic mesoderm (PSM) in response to the observed exponential decrease during somitogenesis of the mRNA concentration of a morphogen (Fgf8). It also accounts for the observed dynamics of the PSM when the molecular components of the network are perturbed. The generality of our model and its robustness allows for its test in other model organisms.",

    "abstract": "Intraspecific genetic structure in widely distributed marine species often mirrors the boundaries between temperature-defined bioregions. This suggests that the same thermal gradients that maintain distinct species assemblages also drive the evolution of new biodiversity. Ecological speciation scenarios are often invoked to explain such patterns, but the fact that adaptation is usually only identified when phylogenetic splits are already evident makes it impossible to rule out the alternative scenario of allopatric speciation with subsequent adaptation. We integrated large-scale genomic and environmental datasets along one of the worlds best defined marine thermal gradients (the South African coastline) to test the hypothesis that incipient speciation in the sea is due to divergence linked to the thermal environment. We identified temperature-associated gene regions in a coastal fish species that is spatially homogeneous throughout several temperature-defined biogeographical regions on the basis of selectively neutral markers. Based on these gene regions, the species is divided into geographically distinct regional populations. Importantly, the ranges of these populations are delimited by the same ecological boundaries that define distinct infraspecific genetic lineages in co-distributed marine the species, and biogeographical disjunctions in species assemblages.

    "abstract": "Streptococcus mutans is a Gram positive bacterium that thrives under acidic conditions and is a primary cause of tooth decay (dental caries). To better understand the metabolism of S. mutans on a systematic level, we manually constructed a genome-scale metabolic model of the S. mutans type strain UA159. The model, called iSMU, contains 656 reactions involving 514 metabolites and the products of 488 genes.\\n\\nWe interrogated S. mutans nutrient requirements using model simulations and nutrient removal experiments in defined media. The iSMU model matched experimental results in greater than 90% of the conditions tested. We also simulated effects of single gene deletions. The models predictions agreed with 78.1% and 84.4% of the gene essentiality predictions from two experimental datasets. Our manually curated model is more accurate than S. mutans models generated from automated reconstruction pipelines. We believe the iSMU model is an important resource for understanding how metabolism enables the cariogenicity of S. mutans.",

    "abstract": "To investigate how chromatin architecture is spatiotemporally organised at a double strand break (DSB) repair locus, we established a biophysical method to quantify chromatin compaction at the nucleosome level during the DNA damage response (DDR). The method is based on phasor image correlation spectroscopy (ICS) of histone FLIM-FRET microscopy data acquired in live cells co-expressing H2B-eGFP and H2B-mCherry. This multiplexed approach generates spatiotemporal maps of nuclear-wide chromatin compaction that when coupled with laser micro-irradiation induced DSBs, quantify the size, stability, and spacing between compact chromatin foci throughout the DDR. Using this technology, we identify that ATM and RNF8 regulate rapid chromatin decompaction at DSBs and formation of a compact chromatin ring surrounding the repair locus. This chromatin architecture serves to demarcate the repair locus from the surrounding nuclear environment and modulate 53BP1 mobility.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTChromatin dynamics play a central role in the DNA damage response (DDR). A long-standing obstacle in the DDR field was the lack of technology capable of visualising chromatin dynamics at double strand break (DSB) sites. Here we describe novel biophysical methods that quantify spatiotemporal chromatin compaction dynamics in living cells. Using these novel tools, we identify how chromatin architecture is reorganised at a DSB locus to enable repair factor access and demarcate the lesion from the surrounding nuclear environment. Further, we identify novel regulatory roles for key DDR enzymes in this process. Finally, we demonstrate method utility with physical, pharmacological and genetic manipulation of the chromatin environment, identifying method potential for use in future studies of chromatin biology.",

We evaluated sixteen pipelines for reconstructing the evolutionary histories of 293 localized prostate cancers from single samples, and eighteen pipelines for the reconstruction of 10 tumours with multi-region sampling. We show that predictions of subclonal architecture and timing of somatic mutations vary extensively across pipelines. Pipelines show consistent types of biases, with those incorporating SomaticSniper and Battenberg preferentially predicting homogenous cancer cell populations and those using MuTect tending to predict multiple populations of cancer cells. Subclonal reconstructions using multi-region sampling confirm that single-sample reconstructions systematically underestimate intra-tumoural heterogeneity, predicting on average fewer than half of the cancer cell populations identified by multi-region sequencing. Overall, these biases suggest caution in interpreting specific architectures and subclonal variants.",

To complement functional assays, it is critical to identify caspase-activating cells in live tissues. Our work describes new caspase-reporters that, for the first time, provide direct information concerning the initial steps of the caspase activation cascade in Drosophila tissues. One of our caspase-sensors has capitalized on the rapid subcellular localization change of a fluorescent marker to uncover novel cellular apoptotic events. These refer to the actin-mediated positioning of the nucleus before cell delamination. The other construct has benefited from a caspase-induced nuclear translocation of a QF transcription factor. This feature enables the genetic manipulation of caspase-activating cells, whilst showing the spatio-temporal patterns of apical caspase activation. Collectively, our sensors offer new experimental opportunities that are already illuminating unknown aspects of caspase-dependent processes in apoptotic and non-apoptotic cellular scenarios.\\n\\nSummary statementWe describe a novel set of caspase sensors that directly detect early caspase activation.

The spindle checkpoint controls the fidelity of chromosome segregation during mitosis. Here, we show that insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 (IRS1/2) cooperate with spindle checkpoint proteins to promote insulin receptor (IR) endocytosis through recruiting the clathrin adaptor complex AP2 to IR. A phosphorylation switch of IRS1/2 orchestrated by extracellularly regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and Src homology phosphatase 2 (SHP2) ensures selective internalization of activated IR. SHP2 inhibition blocks this feedback regulation and growth-promoting IR signaling, prolongs insulin action on metabolism, and improves insulin sensitivity in mice. We propose that mitotic regulators and SHP2 promote feedback inhibition of IR, thereby limiting the duration of insulin signaling. Targeting this feedback inhibition can improve insulin sensitivity.",

As genes encoding proteins assembling in the same multisubunit complexes are dispersed in the genome of eukaryotes, it is unclear how multisubunit complexes assemble. We show that mammalian nuclear transcription complexes (TFIID, TREX-2 and SAGA) composed of a large number of subunits but lacking precise architectural details are built co-translationally. We demonstrate that the dimerization domains and their positions in the interacting subunits determine the co-translational assembly pathway (simultaneous or sequential). Our results indicate that protein translation and complex assembly are linked in building mammalian multisubunit complexes and suggest that co-translational assembly is a general principle in mammalian cells to avoid non-specific interactions and protein aggregation. These findings will significantly advance structural biology by defining endogenous co-translational building blocks in the architecture of multisubunit complexes.",

Measurements of the deformability of cell nuclei in the transitional state that intervenes between the embryonic stem cell state and the differentiation primed state of mouse stem cells, indicate that such nuclei are auxetic i.e. have a negative Poissons ratio. We show, using a theoretical model, how this unusual mechanical behaviour results from the coupling between chromatin compaction states and nuclear shape. Our biophysical approach, which treats chromatin as an active polymer system whose mechanics is modulated by nucleosome binding and unbinding, reproduces experimental results while providing new predictions.

Yet standard models of search are usually based on purely local sensory information. To model how a finite perceptual horizon affects ecological search, we propose a framework for optimal navigation that combines concepts from random walks and optimal control theory. We show that, while local strategies are optimal on asymptotically long and short search times, finite perception yields faster convergence and increased search efficiency over transient time scales relevant in biological systems. The benefit of the finite horizon can be maintained by the searchers tuning their response sensitivity to the length scale of the stimulant in the environment, and is enhanced when the agents interact as a result of increased consensus within subpopulations. Our framework sheds light on the role of spatial perception and transients in search movement and collective sensing of the environment.",

Our high resolution structural analyses into the formation of kinase competent CDK1: Cyclin-B complex have unveiled long-range effects of catalytic lysine in configuring the CDK1 interface for Cyclin-B binding.

    "abstract": "A dysfunctional striatum is thought to contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD, Tourettes syndrome and OCD. Insight into these disorders is reliant on an understanding of the normal development of the striatal cellular and circuit properties. Here we combined whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and anatomical reconstructions of D1 and D2 striatal projection neurons (SPNs) in brain slices to characterize the development of the electrophysiological and morphological properties as well as their long-range and local inputs during the first three postnatal weeks. Overall, we find that many properties develop in parallel but we make several key observations. Firstly, that the electrophysiological properties of young D1 SPNs are more mature and that distinctions between D1 and D2 SPNs become apparent in the second postnatal week. Secondly, that dendrites and spines as well as excitatory inputs from cortex develop in parallel with cortical inputs exhibiting a prolonged period of maturation involving changes in postsynaptic glutamate receptors. Lastly, that initial local connections between striatal SPNs consist of gap junctions, which are gradually replaced by inhibitory synaptic connections. Interestingly, relative biases in inhibitory synaptic connectivity seen between SPNs in adulthood, such as a high connectivity between D2 SPNs, are already evident in the second postnatal week. Combined, these results provide an experimental framework for future investigations of striatal neurodevelopmental disorders and show that many of the cellular and circuit properties are established in the first and second postnatal weeks suggesting intrinsic programs guide their development.\\n\\nSignificance StatementNormal brain development involves the formation of neurons, which develop correct electrical and morphological properties and are precisely connected with each other in a neural circuit. In neurodevelopmental disorders these processes go awry leading to behavioral and cognitive problems later in life. Here we provide for the first time a detailed quantitative description of the cellular and circuit properties of the two main neuron types of the striatum during the first postnatal weeks. This can form an experimental framework for future studies into neurodevelopmental disorders. We find that most of the properties for both types of striatal neuron develop in parallel and are already established by the second postnatal week suggesting a key role for intrinsic programs in guiding their development.",

    "abstract": "Even in response to apparently simple tasks such as hand moving, human brain activity shows remarkable inter-subject variability. Presumably, this variability reflects genuine behavioural or functional variability. Recently, spatial variability of resting-state features in fMRI - specifically connectivity - has been shown to explain (spatial) task-response variability. Such a link, however, is still missing for M/EEG data and its spectrally rich structure. At the same time, it has recently been shown that task responses in M/EEG can be well represented using transient spectral events bursting at fast time scales. Here, we show that individual differences in the spatio-spectral structure of M/EEG task responses, can, to a reasonable degree, be predicted from individual differences in transient spectral events identified at rest. In a MEG dataset of diverse task conditions (including motor responses, working memory and language comprehension tasks) and resting-state sessions for each subject (n = 89), we used Hidden-Markov-Modelling to identify transient spectral events as a feature set to learn the mapping of space-time-frequency content from rest to task. Resulting trial-averaged, subject-specific task-response predictions were then compared with the actual task responses in left-out subjects. All task conditions were predicted significantly above chance. Furthermore, we observed a systematic relationship between genetic similarity (e.g. unrelated subjects vs. twins) and predictability. These findings support the idea that subject-specific transient spectral events in resting-state neural activity are linked to, and predictive of, subject-specific trial-averaged task responses in a wide range of experimental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease is characterized by intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and extracellular plaques of amyloid {beta} peptide, a product of APP processing. The origin of these pathological hallmarks has remained elusive. Here, we have tested the idea that both alterations, at the onset of the disease, may constitute compensatory responses to the same causative and initial trigger, namely NMDA receptor insufficiency. Treatment of rat cortical neurons with the specific NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 within 4 h caused a significant increase in tau phosphorylation at the AT8 and S404 epitopes as well as an increase in APP expression and A{beta} 40 secretion. Single intraperitoneal injections of the NMDA receptor open channel blocker MK-801 into wild-type mice reproduced all of these changes in a brain region-specific fashion either at latency 4 h or 24 h. Subchronic treatment with MK-801 for 6 weeks induced AT8, S404 and S396 immunoreactivity selectively in female mice. We conclude that the pivotal pathological alterations in Alzheimers disease represent runaway physiological responses to persistently insufficient excitatory neurotransmission. In view of the evidence for excitatory insufficiency in trisomy 21 patients, PS1 mutation carriers and ApoE4 carriers, our data suggest a common pathomechanism behind familial, sporadic, and risk allele-triggered Alzheimers disease. The potential of this mechanism to reconcile previous conflicting observations is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Decisions made about identical perceptual stimuli can be radically different under changing task demands. For example, the need to make a fast decision undermines the accuracy of that decision, a well-documented effect termed the speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT). Models of the SAT are generally based on theories of decision making in which responses are triggered only after sensory evidence accumulation terminates at a set threshold. Within this accumulate-to-bound framework, speed pressure operates by lowering the response threshold, allowing for faster responses at the expense of accumulated sensory evidence. To empirically examine the mechanisms necessary for adaptively adjusting the speed and accuracy of decisions, we used an event-related potential that indexes sensory evidence accumulation in the human brain. Instead of lowering response thresholds, we found that speed pressure adaptively shifts responses to occur close to where the rate of evidence accumulation peaks. Moreover, responses are not triggered automatically by the termination of the accumulation process, as sensory evidence continues to build after speeded decisions. Together these results suggest that response processes adaptively access accumulating sensory evidence depending on task demands and support parallel over serial models of decision making.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLate stage Alzheimers disease and other dementias are associated with neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration. Here we describe a mouse (TauD35) carrying human Tau with the P301L mutation that results in Tau hyperphosphorylation and tangles. Previously we have compared gene expression in TauD35 mice to mice which develop plaques but no tangles. A similar comparison of other pathological features throughout disease progression is made here between amyloid{beta} and Tau mice described in Parts I and II of this study.\\n\\nMethodsIn vitro CA1 patch clamp and field recordings were used to investigate synaptic transmission and plasticity. Plaque load and microglia were investigated with immunohistochemistry. Cognition, locomotor activity and anxiety-related behaviours were assessed with a forced-alternation T-maze, open field and light/dark box.\\n\\nResultsTransgene copy number in TauD35 mice fell into two groups (HighTAU and LowTAU), allowing assessment of dose-dependent effects of overexpression and resulting in tangle load increasing 100-fold for a 2-fold change in protein levels. Tangles were first detected at 8 (HighTAU) or 13 months (LowTAU) but the effects on synaptic transmission and plasticity and behaviour were subtle. However severe neurodegeneration occurred in HighTAU mice at around 17 months preceded by considerable proliferation but little additional activation of microglia. Proliferation only started as neurodegeneration began at 13 months. Similarly to HighTau mice at 13 months of age, LowTAU mice at 24 months of age showed a comparable tangle load and microglial proliferation. However, LowTAU mice showed no neurodegeneration at this stage and considerable microglial activation, stressing the dependence of these effects on overexpression and/or age.\\n\\nConclusionsComparison of the effects of amyloid{beta} and plaques without tangles in a model of preclinical Alzheimers disease to the effects of tangles without amyloid{beta} plaques in the late stage model described here may clarify the progressive stages of Alzheimers disease. While Tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangles are eventually sufficient to cause severe neurodegeneration, initial effects on synaptic transmission and the immune response are subtle. In contrast while even with a heavy plaque load little if any neurodegeneration occurs, considerable effects on synaptic transmission and the immune system result, even before plaques are detectable.",

Strikingly, within these fascicles, reading- and math-related tracts are segregated into parallel sub-bundles and show structural differences related to myelination.

    "abstract": "BackgroundProgression of Alzheimers disease is thought initially to depend on rising amyloid{beta} and its synaptic interactions. Transgenic mice (TASTPM; APPSwe/PSEN1M146V) show altered synaptic transmission, compatible with increased physiological function of amyloid{beta}, before plaques are detected. Recently, the importance of microglia has become apparent in the human disease. Similarly, TASTPM show a close association of plaque load with upregulated microglial genes.\\n\\nMethodsCA1 Synaptic transmission and plasticity were investigated using in vitro electrophysiology. Migroglial relationship to plaques was examined with immunohistochemistry. Behaviour was assessed with a forced-alternation T-maze, open field, light/dark box and elevated plus maze.\\n\\nFindingsThe most striking finding is the increase in microglial numbers in TASTPM, which, like synaptic changes, begins before plaques are detected. Further increases and a reactive phenotype occur later, concurrent with development of larger plaques. Long-term potentiation is initially enhanced at pre-plaque stages but decrements with the initial appearance of plaques. Finally, despite altered plasticity, TASTPM have little cognitive deficit, even with a heavy plaque load, although they show altered non-cognitive behaviours.\\n\\nInterpretationThe pre-plaque synaptic changes and microglial proliferation are presumably related to low, non-toxic amyloid{beta} levels in the general neuropil and not directly associated with plaques. However, as plaques grow, microglia proliferate further, clustering around plaques and becoming phagocytic. Like in humans, even when plaque load is heavy, without development of neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration, these alterations do not result in cognitive deficits. Behaviours are seen that could be consistent with pre-diagnosis changes in the human condition.\\n\\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere is a large body of research examining many aspects of phenotypes associated with mouse models of Alzheimers disease - a PubMed search for the terms Alzheimer* AND mouse returns in excess of 21000 articles. However, there are few systematic articles pulling together pathological, functional (electrophysiological), and behavioural analyses across the life-span of such models. There is also a number of conflicting outcomes, for example reports of impaired versus enhanced synaptic plasticity; cognitive impairments or not.\\n\\nRecently, the importance of microglia in Alzheimers disease has come to the fore in human Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), with variants of a number of microglial genes identified as risk-factors for developing the disease. Interestingly, we have recently reported that Trem2 and other genes identified as risk-factors in humans are strongly up regulated in close association to plaque development in the mouse model used in this study. Moreover, this previous study predicted two of the most recently identified genes that were identified in GWAS since the publication of our paper.\\n\\nWe have previously used this model to identify the earliest synaptic changes and shown changes in release of glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, to occur even before plaques are detectable.\\n\\nAdded value of this studyBy studying this transgenic mouse model of Alzheimers disease, throughout the development of plaques, from prior to detection through to heavy plaque loads, we have been able to identify a clear time course of key phenotypic changes associated with early disease. In particular, this study identifies the very early changes in microglia and can separate the time course of the microglial phenotype. In addition, we detail the changes in synaptic plasticity over time and importantly identify that, like in humans in the absence of Tau tangles or neurodegeneration, considerable synaptic changes can occur and a heavy plaque load without resulting in substantial cognitive loss.\\n\\nImplications of all the available evidenceOur data indicate that rising amyloid beta prior to detectable plaque deposition results in changes in synaptic function that likely reflects an enhanced physiological effect of amyloid beta. At this stage, microglia proliferate but do not activate. Once plaques begin to appear, microglia migrate to surround the plaque and become phagocytic, likely targeting dystrophic synapses and neurites caused by the cloud of highly-toxic amyloid beta around the plaque. Similarly to humans, who have plaques but no tangles and have yet to develop substantial neurodegeneration, cognitive deficits are not seen, even with a heavy plaque load; behavioural changes are limited to anxiety-like effects.\\n\\nThis investigation of the parallel time-course of events highlights the probability that, if progression of disease can be reversed or slowed early enough, before Tau tangles and substantial neurodegeneration occur, the symptoms of cognitive decline could be very largely avoided. Moreover, it suggests that the substantial increases in microglia number and upregulation of their specific gene expression in association with plaques, is not associated with cognitive loss and may indeed be protective.",

    "abstract": "Denileukin diftitox (DAB1-389-IL-2, Ontak(R)) is a diphtheria toxin-based fusion protein that depletes CD25-positive cells including regulatory T cells (Tregs) and was approved for the treatment of persistent or recurrent cutaneous T cell lymphoma. However, the clinical use of denileukin diftitox was limited by vascular leak toxicity and production issues related to drug aggregation and purity. We found that a single amino acid substitution (V6A) in a motif associated with vascular leak induction yields a fully active, second-generation biologic, s-DAB1-386-IL-2(V6A), which elicits 50-fold less HUVEC monolayer permeation and is 3.7-fold less lethal to mice by LD50 analysis than s-DAB1-386-IL-2 Additionally, to overcome aggregation problems, we developed a novel production method for the fusion toxin using Corynebacterium diphtheriae that secretes fully-folded, biologically active, monomeric s-DAB1-386-IL-2 into the culture medium. Using the poorly immunogenic mouse B16F10 melanoma model, we initiated treatment 7 days after tumor challenge and observed that, while both s-DAB1-386-IL-2(V6A) and s-DAB1-386-IL-2 are inhibitors of tumor growth, the capacity to treat with higher doses of s-DAB1-386-IL-2(V6A) could provide a superior activity window. In a sequential dual therapy study in tumors that have progressed for 10 days both s-DAB1-386-IL-2(V6A) and s-DAB1-386-IL-2 given prior to checkpoint inhibition with anti-PD-1 antibodies inhibited tumor growth, while either drug given as monotherapy had less effect. s-DAB1-386-IL-2(V6A), a fully monomeric protein with reduced vascular leak, is a second-generation diphtheria toxin-based fusion protein with promise as a cancer immunotherapeutic both alone and in conjunction with PD-1 blockade.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRegulatory T cells (Tregs) infiltrate tumors in various cancers and promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment that hinders anti-tumor immunity. Denileukin diftitox, a diphtheria toxin-based fusion protein that depletes Tregs, was approved for the treatment of T cell malignancies, but its clinical use was limited due to the presence of protein aggregates and toxicity associated with vascular leakage. Here we report the production of a second generation IL-2 receptor-targeted, fully-folded, monomeric diphtheria fusion toxin, and a V6A mutant variant which showed reduced vascular leak in vitro and reduced lethality in mice. In a mouse model of melanoma, we found significant decrease in tumor growth associated with reduction in Tregs when the protein was tested as monotherapy or in combination with checkpoint blockade.",

    "abstract": "Cancer chemotherapy dose schedules are conventionally applied intermittently, with dose duration of the order of hours, intervals between doses of days or weeks, and cycles repeated for weeks. The large number of possible combinations of values of duration, interval, and lethality has been an impediment to empirically determine the optimal set of treatment conditions. The purpose of this project was to determine the set of parameters for duration, interval, and lethality that would be most effective for treating early colon cancer. An agent-based computer model that simulated cell proliferation kinetics in normal human colon crypts was calibrated with measurements of human biopsy specimens. Mutant cells were simulated as proliferating and forming an adenoma, or dying if treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Using a high performance computer, a total of 28,800 different parameter sets of duration, interval, and lethality were simulated. The effect of each parameter set on the stability of colon crypts, the time to cure a crypt of mutant cells, and the accumulated dose was determined. Of the 28,800 parameter sets, 434 parameter sets were effective in curing the crypts of mutant cells before they could form an adenoma and allowed the crypt normal cell dynamics to recover to pretreatment levels. A group of 14 similar parameter sets produced a minimal time to cure mutant cells. A different group of 9 similar parameter sets produced the least accumulated dose. These parameter sets may be considered as candidate dose schedules to guide clinical trials for early colon cancer.",

    "abstract": "The PERK arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) regulates cellular proteostasis and survival in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, the impact of PERK signaling on extracellular proteostasis is poorly understood. We define how PERK signaling influences extracellular proteostasis during ER stress using a conformational reporter of the secreted amyloidogenic protein transthyretin (TTR). We show that inhibiting PERK signaling impairs ER stress-dependent secretion of destabilized TTR by increasing its ER retention in chaperone-bound complexes. Interestingly, PERK inhibition promotes the ER stress-dependent secretion of TTR in non-native conformations that accumulate extracellularly as soluble oligomers. Pharmacologic or genetic TTR stabilization partially restores secretion of native TTR tetramers. However, PERK inhibition still increases the ER stress-dependent secretion of TTR in non-native conformations under these conditions, indicating that the conformation of stable secreted proteins can also be affected by inhibiting PERK. Our results define a role for PERK in regulating extracellular proteostasis during ER stress and indicate that genetic or aging-related alterations in PERK signaling can exacerbate ER stress-related imbalances in extracellular proteostasis implicated in diverse diseases.",
