    "abstract": "Here, we demonstrate that the voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 represents a regulatory mechanism for insulin secretion of pancreatic islet {beta} cell. In vivo, Hv1-de[fi]cient mice display hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance due to reduced insulin secretion, but normal peripheral insulin sensitivity. In vitro, islets of Hv1-de[fi]cient and heterozygous mice, INS-1 (832/13) cells with siRNA-mediated knockdown of Hv1 exhibit a marked defect in glucose- and K+-induced insulin secretion. Hv1 de[fi]ciency decreases both insulin and proinsulin contents, and limits glucose-induced Ca2+ entry and membrane depolarization. Furthermore, loss of Hv1 increases insulin-containing granular pH and decreases cytosolic pH. In addition, histologic studies show a decrease in {beta} cell mass in islets of Hv1-deficient mice. Collectively, our results indicate that Hv1 supports insulin secretion in the {beta} cell by calcium entry, membrane depolarization and intracellular pH regulation.",

    "abstract": "Studies have been surged on extreme environments and hypersaline ecosystems through the recent decades. Despite the apparent severity of the environmental conditions in the Great Salt Plain, recent phylogenetic studies carried on its soil samples have revealed a wide diversity of microorganisms. In this current study, we present the actinobacteria as one of the largest and important phenotypic groups. The Great Salt Plain of Oklahoma is an extreme region and a hypersaline environment from marine origin. Thirty soil samples were collected from vegetated and salt flat sites of the Great Salt Plain area and used for isolation. Actinomycetes were selectively isolated by employing four different media. A total of 358 actinomycetes isolates obtained from the Great Salt Plain soil samples. Based on morphological and physiological characterization 155 representative isolates were chosen for phylogenetic diversity, salt tolerance, and antimicrobial activities. Results from the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicate that, the isolates could be grouped into two genera; phylotypes were detected at high frequency, and affiliated to the genus Streptomyces, and phylotypes were detected at low frequency, and affiliated to the genus Nocardiopsis. The majority of the isolates were of hypersaline or marine origin. 38% of actinomycetes isolates were able to grow at 10% salinity, and only 7% of actinomycetes shown salient ability at 15% salinity. Of the 155 isolates, 44 strains exhibited anti-MRSA bioactivities. To our knowledge, this research paper is the first report on the isolation of actinomycetes members from hypersaline environment of the Great Salt Plain of Oklahoma. This current study confirms that the Great Salt Plain harbors significant diversity of actinobacterial communities, and illustrates their potential for production biologically active molecules. Due to the high bioactivity percentage, broad bioactivities against both MRSA strains, the isolated actinomycetes presented their capability in pharmaceutical application.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampal place cells encode spatial representation but it remains unclear how they store concurrent positive or negative experiences. Here, we report on place field reconfiguration in response to an innately aversive odor trimethylthiazoline (TMT). The advantage of TMT is the absence of learning curve required for associative fear conditioning. Our study investigated if CA1 place cells, recorded from behaving rats, remap randomly or if their reconfiguration depends on the location of the aversive stimulus perception. Exposure to TMT increased the amplitude of hippocampal beta oscillations in two arms of a maze (TMT arms). We found that a population of place cells with fields located outside the TMT arms increased their activity (extra-field spiking) in the TMT arms during the aversive episodes. These cells exhibited significant shift of the center of mass towards the TMT arms in the subsequent post-TMT recording. The induction of extra-field plasticity was mediated by the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). Photostimulation of the BLA triggered aversive behavior, synchronized response of hippocampal local field oscillations, augmented theta rhythm amplitude and increased the spiking of place cells for the first 100ms after the light delivery. This occurred only for the extra-field-but not for intra-field spikes. Optogenetic BLA-triggered an increase in extra-field spiking activity correlated to the degree of place field plasticity in the post-ChR2 recording session. Our findings demonstrate that the increased extra-field activity during aversive episodes mediates the degree of subsequent field plasticity.",

Because of the high-throughput nature of mass spectrometric analyses, the interpretation of these chromatographic data increasingly relies on informatics solutions that attempt to predict an analytes retention time. The key components of such predictive algorithms are the features these are supplies with, and the actual machine learning algorithm used to fit the model parameters.\\n\\nWe here therefore evaluate the performance of seven machine learning algorithms on 36 distinct metabolomics data sets, using two distinct feature sets. Interestingly, the results show that no single learning algorithm performs optimally for all data sets, with different algorithm types achieving top performance for different types of analytes or different protocols. Our results can thus be used to find an optimal retention time prediction algorithm for specific analytes or protocols. Importantly, however, our results also show that blending different types of models together decreases the error on outliers, indicating that the combination of several approaches holds substantial promise for the development of more generic, high-performing algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have demonstrated that the percentage of naive T cells and diversity of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire decrease with age, with some findings likewise suggesting that increased repertoire diversity may be associated with longer lifespan and healthy aging. In this work, we have analyzed peripheral TCR diversity from humans, mice, and blind mole-rats (Spalax spp.)--long-lived, hypoxia- and cancer-tolerant rodents. We employed a quantitative approach to TCR repertoire profiling based on 5RACE with unique molecular identifiers (UMI) to achieve accurate comparison of repertoire diversity, which also required development of specific wet lab protocol and TCR gene reference for Spalax. Our direct comparison reveals a striking phenomenon. Whereas TCR diversity of mice and humans decreases with age, resulting primarily from the shrinkage of the naive T cell pool, Spalax TCR diversity remains stable even for the animals that reach extreme old age (15-17 years). This indicates that T cell immunity does not meaningfully age in long-lived rodents, at least in terms of the classical understanding of immunosenescence, which is associated with the accumulation of large numbers of memory clones. We suggest that the extraordinary longevity of Spalax may be attributable at least in part to the distinctive organization of their T cell immunity. Our findings should therefore encourage a close re-examination of the contribution of immunosenescence to life span in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is an age-related detrimental dementia. Amyloid beta peptides (A{beta}) play a crucial role in the pathology of AD. In familial AD, A{beta} is generated from the full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP) via dysregulated proteolytic processing. However, A{beta} biogenesis in case of sporadic AD remains so far elusive. circRNAs are a class of transcripts, which are preferentially expressed in brain. Here, we identified a circRNA (circA{beta}-a) derived from the A{beta}-coding region of the APP gene. circA{beta}-a is expressed in brains of AD and nondementia controls. With the aid of our recently established approach for analysis of circRNA functions, we demonstrated that circA{beta}-a is efficiently translated into a novel A{beta}-related A{beta}175 protein in living cells. Importantly, A{beta}175 was further processed to A{beta} peptides, the hallmark of AD. In summary, our analysis revealed alternative route of A{beta} biogenesis. circA{beta}-a and its corresponding protein might represent novel therapeutic targets for AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Encoding of a sensory stimulus is believed to be the first step in perceptual decision making. Previous research has shown that electrical signals recorded from the human brain track evidence accumulation during perceptual decision making (Gold and Shadlen, 2007; OConnell et al., 2012; Philiastides et al., 2014). In this study we directly tested the hypothesis that the latency of the N200 recorded by EEG (a negative peak occurring between 150 and 275 ms after stimulus presentation in human participants) reflects the visual encoding time (VET) required for completion of figure-ground segregation before evidence accumulation. We show that N200 latencies vary across individuals, are modulated by external visual noise, and increase response time by x milliseconds when they increase by x milliseconds, reflecting a linear regression slope of 1. Simulations of cognitive decision-making theory show that variation in human response times not related to evidence accumulation (including VET) are tracked by the fastest response times. A relationship with a slope of 1 between N200 latencies and VET was found by fitting a linear model between trial-averaged N200 latencies and the 10th percentiles of response times. A slope of 1 was also found between single-trial N200 latencies and response times. Fitting a novel neuro-cognitive model of decision-making also yielded a slope of 1 between N200 latency and non-decision time in multiple visual noise conditions, indicating that N200 latencies track the completion of visual encoding and the onset of evidence accumulation. The N200 waveforms were localized to the cortical surface at distributed temporal and extrastriate locations, consistent with a distributed network engaged in figure-ground segregation of the target stimulus.\\n\\nSignificance StatementEncoding of a sensory stimulus is believed to be the first step in perceptual decision making. In this study, we report evidence that visual evoked potentials (EPs) around 200 ms after stimulus presentation track the time of visual figure-ground segregation before the onset of evidence accumulation during decision making. These EP latencies vary across individuals, are modulated by external visual noise, and increase response time by x milliseconds when they increase by x milliseconds. Hierarchical Bayesian model-fitting was also used to relate these EPs to a specific cognitive parameter that tracks time related to visual encoding in a decision-making model of response time. This work adds to the growing literature that suggests that EEG signals can track the component cognitive processes of decision making.",

    "abstract": "Over the last 35 years the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been the workhorse tool for plant genome engineering. Replacement of native tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid elements with customizable cassettes enabled insertion of a sequence of interest called Transfer DNA (T-DNA) into any plant genome. Although these T-DNA transfer mechanisms are well understood, detailed understanding of structure and epigenomic status of insertion events was limited by current technologies. To fill this gap, we analyzed transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines from three widely used collections (SALK, SAIL and WISC) with two single molecule technologies, optical genome mapping and nanopore sequencing. Optical maps for four randomly selected T-DNA lines revealed between one and seven insertions/rearrangements, and for the first time the actual length of individual transgene insertions from 27 to 236 kilobases. De novo nanopore sequencing-based genome assemblies for two segregating lines resolved T-DNA structures up to 36 kb into the insertions and revealed large-scale T-DNA associated translocations and exchange of chromosome arm ends. The multiple internally rearranged nature of T-DNA arrays made full assembly impossible, even with long nanopore reads. For the current TAIR10 reference genome, nanopore contigs corrected 83% of non-centromeric misassemblies. This unprecedented nucleotide-level definition of T-DNA insertions enabled the mapping of epigenome data. We identify variable small RNA transgene targeting and DNA methylation. SALK_059379 T-DNA insertions were enriched for 24nt siRNAs and contained dense cytosine DNA methylation. Transgene silencing via the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway was confirmed by in planta assays. In contrast, SAIL_232 T-DNA insertions are predominantly targeted by 21/22nt siRNAs, with DNA methylation and silencing limited to a reporter, but not the resistance gene. With the emergence of genome editing technologies that rely on Agrobacterium for gene delivery, this study provides new insights into the structural impact of engineering plant genomes and demonstrates the utility of state-of-the-art long-range sequencing technologies to rapidly identify unanticipated genomic changes.",

    "abstract": "Systematic analysis of human arginine methylation events bifurcates its signaling mechanism, functioning either in isolation akin to canonical PTM regulation or clustered within disordered protein sequence. Hundreds of proteins contain methyl-arginine clusters and are more prone to mutation and more tightly expression-regulated than dispersed methylation targets. Arginine clusters in the highly methylated RNA binding protein SYNCRIP were experimentally shown to function in concert providing a tunable protein interaction interface. Quantitative immuno-precipitation assays defined two distinct cumulative regulatory mechanisms operating across 18 proximal arginine-glycine motifs in SYNCRIP. Functional binding to the methyl-transferase PRMT1 was promoted by continual arginine stretches while interaction with the methyl-binding protein SMN1 was arginine content dependent irrespective of linear position within the unstructured region. This study highlights how highly repetitive di-amino acid motifs in otherwise low structural complexity regions can provide regulatory potential, and with SYNCRIP as an extreme example how PTMs leverage these disordered sequences to drive cellular functions.",

    "abstract": "The ability to compute the location and direction of sounds is a crucial perceptual skill to efficiently interact with dynamic environments. How the human brain implements spatial hearing is however poorly understood. In our study, we used fMRI to characterize the brain activity of male and female humans listening to left, right, up and down moving as well as static sounds. Whole brain univariate results contrasting moving and static sounds varying in their location revealed a robust functional preference for auditory motion in bilateral human Planum Temporale (hPT). Using independently localized hPT, we show that this region contains information about auditory motion directions and, to a lesser extent, sound source locations. Moreover, hPT showed an axis of motion organization reminiscent of the functional organization of the middle-temporal cortex (hMT+/V5) for vision. Importantly, whereas motion direction and location rely on partially shared pattern geometries in hPT, as demonstrated by successful cross-condition decoding, the responses elicited by static and moving sounds were however significantly distinct. Altogether our results demonstrate that the hPT codes for auditory motion and location but that the underlying neural computation linked to motion processing is more reliable and partially distinct from the one supporting sound source location.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn comparison to what we know about visual motion, little is known about how the brain implements spatial hearing. Our study reveals that motion directions and sound source locations can be reliably decoded in the human Planum Temporale (hPT) and that they rely on partially shared pattern geometries. Our study therefore sheds important new lights on how computing the location or direction of sounds are implemented in the human auditory cortex by showing that those two computations rely on partially shared neural codes. Furthermore, our results show that the neural representation of moving sounds in hPT follows a \\\"preferred axis of motion\\\" organization, reminiscent of the coding mechanisms typically observed in the occipital hMT+/V5 region for computing visual motion.",

In this study, we aim to identify the efficacy of feces as a gut proxy in birds using chickens as a model. We collected 1,026 samples from 206 chickens, including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and feces samples, for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analyses.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, the efficacy of feces as a gut proxy was partitioned to microbial community membership and community structure. Most taxa in the small intestine (84.11 - 87.28%) and ceca (99.39%) could be identified in feces. Microbial community membership was reflected with a gut anatomic feature, but community structure was not. Excluding shared microbes, the small intestine and ceca contributed 34.12 and 5.83% of the total fecal members, respectively. The composition of Firmicutes members in the small intestine and that of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria members in the ceca could be well mirrored by the observations in fecal samples ({rho} = 0.54 - 0.71 and 0.71 - 0.78, respectively, P < 0.001). However, there were few significant correlations for each genus between feces and each of the 4 gut segments, and these correlations were not high ({rho} = -0.2 - 0.4, P < 0.05) for most genera.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results provide evidence that the good potential of feces to identify most taxa in chicken guts, but it should be interpreted with caution by using feces as a proxy for gut in microbial structure analyses.

    "abstract": "Identifying genomic locations of natural selection from sequence data is an ongoing challenge in population genetics. Current methods utilizing information combined from several summary statistics typically assume no correlation of summary statistics regardless of the genomic location from which they are calculated. However, due to linkage disequilibrium, summary statistics calculated at nearby genomic positions are highly correlated. We introduce an approach termed Trendsetter that accounts for the similarity of statistics calculated from adjacent genomic regions through trend filtering, while reducing the effects of multicollinearity through regularization. Our penalized regression framework has high power to detect sweeps, is capable of classifying sweep regions as either hard or soft, and can be applied to other selection scenarios as well. We find that Trendsetter is robust to both extensive missing data and strong background selection, and has comparable power to similar current approaches. Moreover, the model learned by Trendsetter can be viewed as a set of curves modeling the spatial distribution of summary statistics in the genome. Application to human genomic data revealed positively-selected regions previously discovered such as LCT in Europeans and EDAR in East Asians. We also identified a number of novel candidates and show that populations with greater relatedness share more sweep signals.",

We present some integration results of the project, which initially focused on genomics, proteomics and phenomics. AgroLD is now an RDF (Resource Description Format) knowledge base of 100M triples created by annotating and integrating more than 50 datasets coming from 10 data sources -such as Gramene.org and TropGeneDB- with 10 ontologies -such as the Gene Ontology and Plant Trait Ontology. Our evaluation results show users appreciate the multiple query modes which support different use cases. AgroLDs objective is to offer a domain specific knowledge platform to solve complex biological and agronomical questions related to the implication of genes/proteins in, for instances, plant disease resistance or high yield traits. We expect the resolution of these questions to facilitate the formulation of new scientific hypotheses to be validated with a knowledge-oriented approach.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is an inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by skin lesions showing strong neutrophil (PMN) infiltration and high levels of the antimicrobial peptide, LL37, but the role of PMNs in this context remains unclear. We here show that primary human PMNs, especially PMNs from psoriasis patients, not only respond via TLR8 to human and bacterial RNA in complexed with LL37 by cytokine-, chemokine- and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)-release; they also actively release additional RNA and LL37 in response to stimulation by the same complex and both RNA and LL37 were found to be highly abundant in psoriatic skin. Moreover, RNA-LL37-induced NETs propagated PMN activation and could thus fuel a PMN-mediated and self-sustaining inflammatory loop that may represent an unexpected early initiator or amplifying event in psoriasis. Given that TLR inhibitory oligodeoxynucleotides prevented the cytokine production and NETosis of PMNs by RNA-LL37 complexes in vitro, our study also highlights TLR blockade as a potential therapeutic intervention strategy in psoriasis.\n\nSummaryHuman and bacterial RNA in complex with LL37 activates neutrophils via TLR8 to release cytokines, chemokines and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs and neutrophil-rich areas in psoriatic skin contain RNA and LL37, suggesting RNA-LL37 may fuel a PMN-mediated and self-sustaining inflammatory cycle in psoriasis.",

The bacterial communities of two onshore seepage sites were analysed by amplicon sequencing of 16S rDNA, along with determining the geochemical characteristics, hydrocarbon content and the carbon isotope composition of the sites.\\n\\nWhile one site was found to be characterised by biogenic origin of methane gas, with carbon isotope ratio {delta}13C [{per thousand}] = -63.2, high content of organic matter and complex hydrocarbons, the other site showed a mixed origin of the methane gas ({delta}13C [{per thousand}] = -26.6) with geothermal characteristics and lower organic matter content. While both sites harboured Proteobacteria as the most abundant bacterial phyla, the Deltaproteobacteria were more abundant at the geothermal site, and the Alphaproteobacteria at the biogenic site. The Dehalococcoidia class of the Chloroflexi phylum was abundant at the geothermal site while the Anaerolineae class was more abundant at the biogenic site. Bacterial strains from the seepage pockmarks were isolated on a variety of selective media targeting bacteria with bioremediation potential. A total of 106 strains were isolated and characterised, including representatives from the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacterioidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria.

While several studies have suggested a role for frontal brain areas in enhancing task-related representations in visual cortices, especially the lateral-occipital cortex, they remained silent about the type of information transferred to visual areas. However, the recently developed method of representational causality analysis, allowed us to track the movement of different types of information in the brain. Accordingly, we designed an EEG object detection experiment and evaluated the spatiotemporal dynamics of category- and target-related information across the brain using. Results showed that the prefrontal area initiated the processing of target-related information. This information was then transferred to posterior brain areas during stimulus presentation to facilitate object detection and to direct the decision-making procedure. We also observed that, as compared to category-related information, the target-related information could predict the behavioral detection performance more accurately, suggesting the dominant representation of internal compared to external information in brain signals. These results provided new evidence about the role of prefrontal cortices in the processing of task-related information the brain during object detection.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral change studies and interventions focus on self-control and external reinforcements as means to influence preferences. Cue-approach training (CAT) has been shown to induce preference changes lasting months following a mere association of items with a neutral cue and a speeded response, without external reinforcements. We utilized this paradigm to study preference representation and modification in the brain without external reinforcements. We scanned 36 participants with fMRI during a novel passive viewing task before, after and 30 days following CAT. We pre-registered the predictions that activity in regions related to memory, top-down attention and value processing underlie behavioral change. We found that bottom-up neural mechanisms, involving visual processing regions, were associated with immediate behavioral change, while reduced top-down parietal activity and enhanced hippocampal activity were related to the long-term change. Enhanced activity in value-related regions was found both immediately and in the long-term. Our findings suggest a novel neural mechanism of preference representation and modification. We suggest that non-reinforced change occurs initially in perceptual representation of items, which putatively lead to long-term changes in memory and top-down processes. These findings could lead to implementation of bottom-up instead of top-down targeted interventions to accomplish long-lasting behavioral change.",

Stabilizing, homeostatic forms of synaptic and intrinsic plasticity are critical for preventing circuit hyper- or hypo-excitability, leading us to ask whether Shank3 loss perturbs circuits by disrupting homeostatic plasticity. We show that Shank3 loss abolishes synaptic and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity, which can be rescued by lithium(Li), a drug with therapeutic potential in human Shankopathies. Further, Shank3 loss in vivo severely compromises the ability of visual cortical circuits to recover from perturbations to sensory drive.

    "abstract": "We recently discovered that inhibition of the lipid peroxidase GPX4 can selectively kill cancer cells in a therapy-resistant state through induction of ferroptosis. Although GPX4 lacks a conventional druggable pocket, covalent small-molecule inhibitors are able to overcome this challenge by reacting with the GPX4 catalytic selenocysteine residue to eliminate enzymatic activity. Unfortunately, all currently-reported GPX4 inhibitors achieve their activity through reactive chloroacetamide groups. We demonstrate that such chloroacetamide-containing compounds are poor starting points for further advancement given their promiscuity, instability, and low bioavailability. Development of improved GPX4 inhibitors, including those with therapeutic potential, requires the identification of new electrophilic chemotypes and mechanisms of action that do not suffer these shortcomings. Here, we report our discovery that nitrile oxide electrophiles, and a set of remarkable chemical transformations that generates them in cells from masked precursors, provide an effective strategy for selective targeting of GPX4. Our results, which include structural insights, target engagement assays, and diverse GPX4-inhibitor tool compounds, provide critical insights that may galvanize development of improved compounds that illuminate the basic biology of GPX4 and therapeutic potential of ferroptosis induction. In addition, our discovery that nitrile oxide electrophiles engage in highly selective cellular interactions and are bioavailable in their masked forms may be relevant for targeting other currently undruggable proteins, such as those revealed by recent proteome-wide ligandability studies.",

They comprise multiple subtypes distinguishable by morphology, physiology, projections, and levels of expression of melanopsin (Opn4), their photopigment. The molecular programs that differentiate ipRGCs from other ganglion cells and ipRGC subtypes from one another remain elusive. Here, we present comprehensive gene expression profiles of early postnatal and adult mouse ipRGCs purified from two lines of reporter mice marking different sets of ipRGC subtypes. We find dozens of novel genes highly enriched in ipRGCs. We reveal that Rasgrp1 and Tbx20 are selectively expressed in subsets of ipRGCs, though these molecularly defined groups imperfectly match established ipRGC subtypes. We demonstrate that the ipRGCs regulating circadian photoentrainment are unexpectedly diverse at the molecular level. Our findings reveal unexpected complexity in gene expression patterns across mammalian ipRGC subtypes.",

    "abstract": "The clock of life ticks as fast as how efficiently proteins could perform their functional dynamics. Protein complexes execute functions via several large-scale intrinsic motions across multiple conformational states, which occur at a timescale of nano-to milliseconds for well-folded proteins. Computationally expensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has been the only theoretical tool to time and size these motions, though barely to their slowest ends. Here, we convert a simple elastic network model (ENM), which takes a few seconds (ubiquitin) to hours (ribosome) for the analysis, into a molecular timer and sizer to gauge the slowest functional motions of proteins. Quasi-harmonic analysis, fluctuation-profile matching (FPM) and the Wiener-Khintchine theorem (WKT) are used to define the \\\"time-periods\\\", t, for anharmonic principal components (PCs) which are validated by NMR order parameters. The PCs with their respective \\\"time-periods\\\" are mapped to the eigenvalues ({lambda}ENM) of the corresponding ENM modes. Thus, the power laws t(ns) = 86.9{lambda}ENM-1.9 and {sigma}2([A]2) = 46.1 {lambda}ENM-2.5 are established allowing the characterization of the time scales of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)-solved conformers, crystallographic anisotropic displacement parameters, and important ribosomal motions, as well as motional sizes of the latter.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe time scale of biological processes is governed by protein functional dynamics that often corresponds to the largest conformational spread and the longest time scales among all possible motions. Current simulation methodologies cannot reach the slowest, often functional, motions especially for supramolecular machineries. Borrowing the spring-bead model used in polymer physics since 60s, the efficient elastic network model (ENM), introduced in 90s, captured all modes of protein motions but largely underestimated the time scales of slowest modes due to its harmonic approximation.\\n\\nHere we map water-damped modes sampled by MD simulations to corresponding ones in ENM and thereby establish 2 power laws that describe the authentic time scales and sizes for the slowest anharmonic modes as functions of ENM eigenvalues. With that, we adequately describe the sizes and time scales for three proteins, confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, and ribosome that contains ~0.2 million heavy atoms (~ 20 thousands coarse-grained nodes).",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAll nations of the Greater Mekong Subregion have committed to elimination of malaria by the year 2030. Elimination efforts rely on increasing access to diagnosis and treatment. However, asymptomatic infections pose a major challenge for these efforts. One approach towards eliminating asymptomatic reservoirs is targeted mass antimalarial drug administration (MDA). Here we present a fine scale spatiotemporal analysis of malaria incidence and prevalence in villages undergoing MDA.\\n\\nMethodsFour villages along the Myanmar-Thailand border were selected for a MDA pilot study based on clinical records and prevalence surveys. Passive detection of clinical episodes was facilitated through community based malaria clinics in each village. All villagers were screened using venous blood and ultra-sensitive qPCR (uPCR) for detection of parasites at baseline and every subsequent 3 months until month 18 (M18). A final screening was done at M24. MDAs were conducted on M0, M1 and M2 in two villages and on M9, M10, M11 in the remaining two villages. Which villages received early or deferred MDA was decided using restricted randomization. MDA participation, clinical episodes and uPCR detected infections were mapped to participant houses. Scan statistics were used to test for clusters of malaria episodes, malaria infections and non-adherence to MDA. Mixed effects regressions were used to test for risk factors for clinical episodes after MDA.\\n\\nResultsNeighborhood level MDA adherence was a major predictor for clinical episodes of malaria post-MDA, suggesting a strong herd effect. Each village had a cluster of P. falciparum infections at M0. After M0, there were no clusters of uPCR detectable P. falciparum infections. Clinical episodes of P. falciparum occurred in one village only which had a cluster of non-adherence to MDA and a high mosquito vector human biting rate. Individuals with subclinical P.falciparum infections were more likely to have subsequent clinical episodes than individuals who had no subclinical infections. Individuals who lived in a house with someone who had a clinical episode were more likely to also have a clinical episode subsequently than individuals residing in a house free of P.falciparum infections.\\n\\nConclusionTo our knowledge this is the first study to show a herd effect from MDA for malaria. These data and results have significance for spatial targeting of interventions for malaria elimination. Clusters of non-adherence to MDA participation can lead to failed elimination if they occur among individuals with asymptomatic infections and given sufficient mosquito vector exposure. Community participation, which can be facilitated through community engagement, is key to MDA success.",

    "abstract": "The composition and physical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) critically influence tumour cell behaviour, and ECM deposition and remodelling by stromal fibroblast populations is therefore pivotal for tumour progression. The molecular mechanisms by which stromal and tumour cell populations regulate ECM layering are poorly understood. Tumour-stroma interaction is critically dependent on cell-cell communication mediated by exosomes, small vesicles secreted by most cell types and generated within multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Here, we show that caveolin-1 (Cav1), an essential regulator of stromal remodelling and tumour cell fate, plays a central role in modulating both exosome biogenesis and exosomal protein cargo sorting through cholesterol-dependent mechanisms. Quantitative proteomics profiling revealed that a major share of Cav1-dependent exosomal cargoes are compsed of ECM proteins, one of the most important components being tenascin-C (TnC). Comparative functional assays demonstrated that Cav1 is required for fibroblast-derived exosomes to depose ECM and promote tumour cell invasiveness. Exosomes purified from Cav1WT cells, but not those from Cav1-null cells, were able to nucleate distant stromal niches in different organs in vivo. These findings suggest a key role for Cav1 as a cholesterol rheostat in MVBs, and seems to determine ECM deposition by eliciting ECM component sorting into specific exosome pools. These results, together with previous work, support a model in which Cav1 is a central regulatory hub for tumour-stroma interactions through a novel exosome-dependent ECM deposition mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae infections affect infants and the immunocompromised, and the recent emergence of hypervirulent and multi-drug resistant K. pneumoniae lineages is a critical healthcare concern. Hypervirulence in K. pneumoniae is mediated by several factors, including the overproduction of extracellular capsule. However, the full details of how K. pneumoniae capsule biosynthesis is achieved or regulated are not known. We have developed a robust and sensitive procedure to identify genes influencing capsule production, density-TraDISort, which combines density gradient centrifugation with transposon-insertion sequencing. We have used this method to explore capsule regulation in two clinically-relevant Klebsiella strains; K. pneumoniae NTUH-K2044 (capsule type K1), and K. pneumoniae ATCC43816 (capsule type K2). We identified multiple genes required for full capsule production in K. pneumoniae, as well as putative suppressors of capsule in NTUH-K2044, and have validated the results of our screen with targeted knockout mutants. Further investigation of several of the K. pneumoniae capsule regulators identified - ArgR, MprA/KvrB, SlyA/KvrA and the Sap ABC transporter - revealed effects on capsule amount and architecture, serum resistance and virulence. We show that capsule production in K. pneumoniae is at the centre of a complex regulatory network involving multiple global regulators and environmental cues, and that the majority of capsule regulatory genes are located in the core genome. Overall our findings expand our understanding of how capsule is regulated in this medically-important pathogen, and provide a technology that can be easily implemented to study capsule regulation in other bacterial species.\\n\\nImportanceCapsule production is essential for K. pneumoniae to cause infections, but its regulation and mechanism of synthesis are not fully understood in this organism. We have developed and applied a new method for genome-wide identification of capsule regulators. Using this method, many genes that positively or negatively affect capsule production in K. pneumoniae were identified, and we use these data to propose an integrated model for capsule regulation in this species. Several of the genes and biological processes identified have not previously been linked to capsule synthesis. We also show that the methods presented here can be applied to other species of capsulated bacteria, providing the opportunity to explore and compare capsule regulatory networks in other bacterial strains and species.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas virus PA5oct has a large, linear, double-stranded DNA genome (287,182 bp) and is related to Escherichia phages 121Q/PBECO 4, Klebsiella phage vB_KleM-RaK2, Klebsiella phage K64-1, and Cronobacter phage vB_CsaM_GAP32. A protein-sharing network analysis highlights the conserved core genes within this clade. Combining genome, RNAseq and mass spectrometry analyses of its virion proteins allowed us to accurately identify genes and elucidate regulatory elements for this phage (ncRNAs, tRNAs and promoter elements). In total PA5oct encodes 462 CDS (compared to 345 in silico predicted genes using automated annotation pipelines), of which 25.32%, have been identified as virion-associated based on ESI-MS/MS. The RNAseq-based temporal genome organization suggests a gradual take-over by viral transcripts from 21%, 69%, and 92% at 5, 15 and 25 min after infection, respectively. Like many large phages, PA5oct is not organized into contiguous regions of temporal transcription. However, although the temporal regulation of the PA5oct genome expression reveals specific genome clusters expressed in early and late infection, many genes encoding experimentally observed structural proteins surprisingly appear to remain almost untranscribed throughout the infection cycle. Within the host, operons associated with elements of a cryptic Pf1-like prophage are upregulated, as are operons responsible for Psl exopolysaccharide (pslE-J) and periplasmic nitrate reductase (napA-F) production. The characterization described here represents a crucial step towards understanding the genomic complexity as well as molecular diversity of jumbo viruses.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we identified reproducible substructures in the folded structures of long intron RNAs for recursive spliced variants and annotated pre-mRNA for GABRB3 and GABRA5. We mapped the RNA motives recognized by RNA-binding proteins for the specified locus and characterized the area of preferred localization. A comparison of pre-mRNA variants revealed the dominant type of protein potential effects. We determined the structural specifics of RNA in the dense Alu cluster and clarified the analogy of apical substructure to the A-Xist fragment of transcriptional variant. Mapping of the nucleosome potential reveals alternation of strong and weak signals at the 3-end portion of GABRB3 and clusters of nucleosome positioning signal in the vicinity of the Alu cluster. Distribution of simple oligonucleotides among reproducible substructures revealed an enrichment in Py-tracts; for some of them, this may be considered as a complementary supplement to the Pu-tract enrichment of ncRNA Malat1 as a component of nuclear speckles. The secondary structure elements of bidirectional transcripts are predisposed for somatic homolog pairing in this locus, as was previously shown experimentally.\\n\\nA model of potential intron RNA influence on splicing has been suggested based on its interaction with Py-tract-binding RNP, serine-arginine SRSF proteins, ncRNA Malat1, as well as the action of Alu cluster.",

A randomized, prospective, and open-labeled trial directly comparing the effects of tadalafil (a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor) 5 mg once daily and tamsulosin (an 1-blocker) 0.2 mg once daily for 12 weeks in LUTS/BPH patients was conducted. Data were recorded before randomization as well as at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after medication. Fifteen patients allocated tadalafil and 20 allocated tamsulosin completed 12 weeks of medication. Total IPSS, IPSS voiding, and IPSS-QOL scores declined with medication, but there was no difference between drugs. IPSS storage scores reduced more in the tamsulosin group than tadalafil group. OABSS did not decline significantly with medication. IIEF5 was maintained in the tadalafil group, but declined in the tamsulosin group. The maximum flow rate and post-void residual urine volume did not significantly change with medication. Daytime, night-time, and 24-hour urinary frequencies as well as the mean and largest daytime, night-time, and 24-hour voiding volumes per void did not significantly change with medication. In conclusion, tamsulosin was more effective to reduce storage symptoms than tadalafil. Tadalafil had the advantage of maintaining the erectile function.",

    "abstract": "ImportanceHurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. As recently as May of this year (2018), the official death count was 64. After a study describing a household survey reported a much higher death count estimate, as well as evidence of population displacement, extensive loss of services, and a prolonged death rate the government released death registry data. These newly released data will permit a better understanding of the effects of this hurricane.\\n\\nObjectiveProvide a detailed description of the effects on mortality of Hurricane Maria and compare to other hurricanes.\\n\\nDesignWe fit a statistical model to mortality data that accounts for seasonal and non-hurricane related yearly effects. We then estimated the deviation from the expected death rate as a function of time.\\n\\nSettingWe fit this model to 1985-2018 Puerto Rico daily data, which includes the dates of hurricanes Hugo, Georges, and Maria, 2015-2018 Florida daily data, which includes the dates of Hurricane Irma, 2002-2004 Louisiana monthly data, which includes the date of Hurricane Katrina, and 2000-2016 New Jersey monthly data, which includes the date of Hurricane Sandy.\\n\\nResultsWe find a prolonged increase in death rate after Maria and Katrina, lasting at least 207 and 125 days, resulting in excess deaths estimates of 3,400 (95% CI, 3,100-3,700), and 1,800 (95% CI, 1,600-2100) respectively, showing that Maria had a more long term damaging impact. Surprisingly, we also find that in 1998, Georges had a comparable impact to Katrinas with a prolonged increase of 106 days resulting in 1,400 (95% CI, 1,200-1,700) excess deaths. For Hurricane Maria, we find sharp increases in a small number of causes of deaths, including diseases of the circulatory, endocrine and respiratory system, as well as bacterial infections and suicides.\\n\\nConclusion and RelevanceOur analysis suggests that since at least 1998, Puerto Ricos health system has been in a precarious state. Without a substantial intervention, it appears that if hit with another strong hurricane, Puerto Ricans will suffer the unnecessary death of hundreds of its citizens.\\n\\nKey PointsQuestion: How does the effect of Hurricane Maria on mortality in Puerto Rico compare to the effect of other hurricanes in Puerto Rico and other United States jurisdictions?\\n\\nFindings: We estimate about 3,000 excess deaths after Maria, a higher toll than Katrina. Only other comparable effect was after Georges, also in Puerto Rico. For Georges and Maria, we observe a prolonged death rate increase of more than 10% lasting several months. The causes of death that increased after Maria are consistent with a collapsed health system\\n\\nMeaning: Puerto Ricos health system does not appear to be ready to withstand another strong hurricane.",

We have shown previously that the molecular-based, colorimetric malachite green loop-mediated isothermal amplification (MG-LAMP) assay is a valuable tool for diagnosing malaria infection in a laboratory setting. In this study, we field evaluated this assay in a malaria diagnostic post in Roraima, Brazil. We prospectively collected 91 patient samples and performed microscopy, MG-LAMP, and real-time PCR (PET-PCR) to detect Plasmodium infection. Two independent readers were used to score the MG-LAMP tests to assess whether the sample was positive (blue/green) or negative (clear). There was 100% agreement between the two readers (Kappa=1). All tests detected 33 positive samples, but both the MG-LAMP and PET-PCR detected 6 and 7 more positive samples, respectively. The PET-PCR assay detected 6 mixed infections (defined as infection with both P. falciparum and P. vivax) while microscopy detected one and MG-LAMP detected two of these mixed infections. Microscopy did not detect any Plasmodium infection in 26 of the enrolled asymptomatic cases while MG-LAMP detected five and PET-PCR assay three positive cases. Overall, MG-LAMP provided a simpler and user-friendly molecular method for malaria diagnosis that is more sensitive than microscopy. Additionally, MG- LAMP has the capacity to test 38 samples per run (one hour), allowing for the screening of large number of samples which is appealing when large-scale studies are necessary e.g. in community surveillance studies. The current MG-LAMP assay was limited in its ability to detect mixed infection when compared to the PET-PCR, but otherwise proved to be a powerful tool for malaria parasite detection in the field and opens new perspectives in the implementation of surveillance studies in malaria elimination campaigns.",

This paper aimed to investigate recent trends in mental ill-health and health-related behaviours in two cohorts of UK adolescents in 2005 and 2015.\\n\\nMethodTrends in harmonised mental ill-health (depressive symptoms, self-harm, anti-social behaviours, parent reported difficulties) and health related behaviours (substance use, weight, weight perception, sleep, sexual intercourse) were examined at age 14 in two UK birth cohorts; Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N=5627, born 1991-92) and Millennium Cohort Study (MCS, N=11318, born 2000-02). Prevalences and trend estimates are presented unadjusted and using propensity score matching and entropy balancing.\\n\\nResultsDepressive symptoms (9% to [~]15%) and self-harm (11.8% to [~]14.5%) increased over the 10 years. Parent-reported emotional difficulties, conduct problems, hyperactivity and peer problems were higher in 2015 compared to 2005 (5.7 - 9% to 9 - 18%).Conversely, substance use (tried smoking 9% to 3%; tried alcohol 52% to [~]43%, cannabis 4.6% to [~]4%), sexual activity (2% to [~]1%) and anti-social behaviours (6.2 - 40.1% to 1.6 - 28%) were less common or no different. Adolescents in 2015 were spending less time sleeping, had higher BMIs and a greater proportion perceived themselves as overweight.\\n\\nConclusionGiven health-related behaviours are often cited as risk-factors for poor mental health, our findings suggest relationships between these factors might be more complex and dynamic in nature than currently understood. Striking increases in mental health difficulties, BMI and poor sleep related behaviours highlight an increasing public health challenge.",

    "abstract": "Why does closed-loop invasive brain stimulation improve seizure control in some patients with epilepsy, but not others? The RNS System, the only FDA-approved bi-directional brain-computer interface, has been shown to improve seizure control in patients with refractory epilepsy, although the mechanisms behind this success are undefined. We analyzed recordings from the RNS System and discovered two main categories of electrophysiological signatures of stimulation-induced modulation of the seizure network. Direct effects included ictal inhibition and early frequency modulation but did not correlate with improved clinical outcomes. Only indirect effects, those occurring remote from triggered stimulation, predicted improved clinical outcomes. These indirect effects, which included spontaneous ictal inhibition, frequency modulation, fragmentation, and ictal duration modulation, may reflect progressive local epileptogenic network compartmentalization that hinders the spread of pathological synchrony from recruiting neuronal populations. Our findings suggest that responsiveness to RNS may be explained by chronic stimulation-induced modulation of seizure network activity, rather than direct effects on each detected seizure.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEstimating energy expenditure with indirect calorimetry requires expensive equipment and provides slow and noisy measurements. Rapid estimates using wearable sensors would enable techniques like optimizing assistive devices outside a lab. Existing methods correlate data from wearable sensors to measured energy expenditure without evaluating the accuracy of the estimated energy expenditure for activity conditions or subjects not included in the correlation process. Our goal is to assess data-driven models that are capable of rapidly estimating energy expenditure for new conditions and subjects.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed models that estimated energy expenditure from two datasets during walking conditions with (1) ankle exoskeleton assistance and (2) various loads and inclines. The estimation was portable and rapid, using input features that are possible to measure with wearable sensors and restricting the input data length to a single gait cycle or four second interval. The performance of the models was evaluated for three use cases. The first case estimated energy expenditure during walking conditions for subjects with some subject specific training data available. The second case estimated all conditions in the dataset for a new subject not included in the training data. The third case estimated new conditions for a new subject. The models also ordered the magnitude of energy expenditure across all conditions for a new subject.\\n\\nResultsThe average errors in energy expenditure estimation during assisted walking conditions were 4.4%, 8.0%, and 8.1% for the three use cases, respectively. The average errors in energy expenditure estimation during inclined and loaded walking conditions were 6.1%, 9.7%, and 11.7% for the three use cases. The models ordered the magnitude of energy expenditure with a maximum and average percentage of correctly ordered conditions of 56% and 43% for assisted walking and 85% and 55% for incline and loaded walking.\\n\\nConclusionsOur data-driven models determined the accuracy of energy expenditure estimation for three use cases. For experiments where the accuracy of a data-driven model is sufficient, standard indirect calorimetry can be replaced. The energy expenditure ordering could aid in selecting optimal assistance conditions. The models, code, and datasets are provided for reproduction and extension of our results.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe percentage of children in Scotland and England meeting the aerobic physical activity recommendation differ greatly according to the estimates derived from the respective national health surveys. The Scottish Health Survey (SHeS) usually estimates that over 70% meet the guidelines; Health Survey for England (HSE) estimates are usually below 25%. It is plausible that these differences originate from different analysis methods. The HSE monitor the percentage of children that undertake 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on each day of the week ( the daily minimum method (DMM)). The SHeS monitor the proportion that undertake at least seven sessions of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, with an average daily duration over 60 minutes ( the average method (WAM)). We aimed to establish how great an influence this difference in analysis methods has on the prevalence estimates.\\n\\nMethodsPhysical activity data from 5-15 year olds in the 2015 HSE and SHeS were reanalysed (weighted n=3840 and 965, respectively). Two comparable pairs of estimates were derived: a DMM and WAM estimate from the HSE not including travel to/from school, and WAM estimates from the HSE and the SHeS including travel to/from school. It is not possible to calculate a DMM estimate from the SHeS due to the way the questions are asked. Results were presented for the total samples, and by sex and age sub-groups.\\n\\nResultsThe HSE WAM estimate was 31.7 (95% CI: 30.2-33.3) percentage points higher than the DMM estimate (54.3% (95% CI: 52.6-56.0) and 22.6% (95% CI: 21.2-24.1) respectively). The magnitude of this difference differed by age group but not sex. When comparable WAM estimates were derived from the SHeS and the HSE, the SHeS was 11.8 percentage points higher (73.6% (95% CI: 69.8-77.1) and 61.8% (95% CI: 60.2-63.5) respectively). The magnitude of this difference differed by age group and sex.\\n\\nConclusionsThe results indicate that the difference in the analysis method explains the majority (approximately 30 percentage points) of the difference in the child physical activity prevalence estimates between Scotland and England. These results will help those involved in national surveillance to determine how to increase comparability between the U.K. home nations.",

The information in these profiles is sufficient to classify cell types by distinct expression patterns but the high complexity of scRNA-seq libraries often prevents full characterization of transcriptomes from individual cells. To extract more focused gene expression information from scRNA-seq libraries, we developed a strategy to physically recover the DNA molecules comprising transcriptome subsets, enabling deeper interrogation of the isolated molecules by another round of DNA sequencing. We applied the method in cell-centric and gene-centric modes to isolate cDNA fragments from scRNA-seq libraries. First, we resampled the transcriptomes of rare, single megakaryocytes from a complex mixture of lymphocytes and analyzed them in a second round of DNA sequencing, yielding up to 20-fold greater sequencing depth per cell and increasing the number of genes detected per cell from a median of 1,313 to 2,002. We similarly isolated mRNAs from targeted T cells to improve the reconstruction of their VDJ-rearranged immune receptor mRNAs. Second, we isolated CD3D mRNA fragments expressed across cells in a scRNA-seq library prepared from a clonal T cell line, increasing the number of cells with detected CD3D expression from 59.7% to 100%. Transcriptome resampling is a general approach to recover targeted gene expression information from single-cell RNA sequencing libraries that enhances the utility of these costly experiments, and may be applicable to the targeted recovery of molecules from other single-cell assays.",

    "abstract": "The internal representations of early deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) were found to be remarkably similar to the internal neural representations measured experimentally in the primate brain. Here we ask, as deep ANNs have continued to evolve, are they becoming more or less brain-like? ANNs that are most functionally similar to the brain will contain mechanisms that are most like those used by the brain. We therefore developed Brain-Score - a composite of multiple neural and behavioral benchmarks that score any ANN on how similar it is to the brains mechanisms for core object recognition - and we deployed it to evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art deep ANNs. Using this scoring system, we here report that: (1) DenseNet-169, CORnet-S and ResNet-101 are the most brain-like ANNs. (2) There remains considerable variability in neural and behavioral responses that is not predicted by any ANN, suggesting that no ANN model has yet captured all the relevant mechanisms. (3) Extending prior work, we found that gains in ANN ImageNet performance led to gains on Brain-Score. However, correlation weakened at [&ge;] 70% top-1 ImageNet performance, suggesting that additional guidance from neuroscience is needed to make further advances in capturing brain mechanisms. (4) We uncovered smaller (i.e. less complex) ANNs that are more brain-like than many of the best-performing ImageNet models, which suggests the opportunity to simplify ANNs to better understand the ventral stream. The scoring system used here is far from complete. However, we propose that evaluating and tracking model-benchmark correspondences through a Brain-Score that is regularly updated with new brain data is an exciting opportunity: experimental benchmarks can be used to guide machine network evolution, and machine networks are mechanistic hypotheses of the brains network and thus drive next experiments. To facilitate both of these, we release Brain-Score.org: a platform that hosts the neural and behavioral benchmarks, where ANNs for visual processing can be submitted to receive a Brain-Score and their rank relative to other models, and where new experimental data can be naturally incorporated.",

Participants completed tasks with varying demands on self-other processing including visual perspective taking and episodic memory with self and other encoding. At baseline, SEA showed greater self-other integration than CA in the level one (line-of-sight) VPT task as indexed by greater interference from the alternate perspective. Anodal HD-tDCS to the dmPFC resulted in the CA performing closer to the SEA during egocentric perspective judgements. Baseline performance on level two (embodied rotation) VPT task and the self-reference effect in memory (SRE) was comparable between the two groups. In the combined sample, HD-tDCS to the rTPJ decreased the interference from the egocentric perspective during level two VPT and dmPFC HD-tDCS removed the SRE in episodic memory. Stimulation effects were comparable when baseline performance was comparable. When baseline performance differed, stimulation differences were identified. Therefore, social cognitive differences due to cultural background are an important consideration in social brain stimulation studies.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LICompared with Caucasians, South-East Asians were influenced by the alternate perspective to a greater extent during level one visual perspective taking\\nC_LIO_LIAnodal HD-tDCS to the dmPFC shifted Caucasians closer to the baseline performance of South-East Asians\\nC_LIO_LIAnodal HD-tDCS to the dmPFC removed the self-reference effect in episodic memory in both cultural groups\\nC_LIO_LIAnodal HD-tDCS to the dmPFC reduced overall memory performance in the South-East Asians but not in the Caucasian group\\nC_LIO_LIAnodal HD-tDCS to the rTPJ reduced egocentric interference in a level two visual perspective taking task in both cultural groups\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMost biocomputing pipelines are run on clusters of computers. Each type of cluster has its own API (application programming interface). That API defines how a program that is to run on the cluster must request the submission, content and monitoring of jobs to be run on the cluster. Sometimes, it is desirable to run the same pipeline on different types of cluster. This can happen in situations including when:\\n\\nO_LIdifferent labs are collaborating, but they do not use the same type of cluster\\nC_LIO_LIa pipeline is released to other labs as open source or commercial software\\nC_LIO_LIa lab has access to multiple types of cluster, and wants to choose between them for scaling, cost or other purposes\\nC_LIO_LIa lab is migrating their infrastructure from one cluster type to another\\nC_LIO_LIduring testing or travelling, it is often desired to run on a single computer\\nC_LI\\n\\nHowever, since each type of cluster has its own API, code that runs jobs on one type of cluster needs to be re-written if it is desired to run that application on a different type of cluster. To resolve this problem, we created a software module to generalize the submission of pipelines across computing environments, including local compute, clouds and clusters.\\n\\nResultsHPCI (High Performance Computing Interface) is a Perl module that provides the interface to a standardized generic cluster.\\n\\nWhen the HPCI module is used, it accepts a parameter to specify the cluster type.

Rather than having to re-write portions of the program, it is only necessary to change a configuration file.\\n\\nUsing HPCI, an application can manage collections of jobs to be runs, specify ordering dependencies, detect success or failure of jobs run and allow automatic retry of failed jobs (allowing for the possibility of a changed configuration such as when the original attempt specified an inadequate memory allotment).",

The SeqTailor webserver streamlines the sequence extraction process, and accelerates the analysis of genetic variant data with software requiring DNA or protein sequences. SeqTailor will facilitate the study of human genomic variation, by increasing the feasibility of sequence-based analysis and prediction.

Recent advances in systems biology are changing what is possible, however, and comparative phylogenetic methods that can handle this new data are wanted. Here, we introduce the term \\\"phylogenetic latent variable models\\\" (PLVMs, pronounced \\\"plums\\\") for a class of models that has recently been used to infer the evolution of cellular states from systems-level molecular data, and develop a new parameterization and fitting strategy that is useful for comparative inference of biochemical networks. We deploy this new framework to infer the ancestral states and evolutionary dynamics of protein-interaction networks by analyzing >16,000 predominantly metazoan co-fractionation and affinity-purification mass spectrometry experiments. Based on these data, we estimate ancestral interactions across unikonts, broadly recovering protein complexes involved in translation, transcription, proteostasis, transport, and membrane trafficking. Using these results, we predict an ancient core of the Commander complex made up of CCDC22, CCDC93, C16orf62, and DSCR3, with more recent additions of COMMD-containing proteins in tetrapods. We also use simulations to develop model fitting strategies and discuss future model developments.",

Early reports indicated the possibility that rostral entopeduncular nucleus (rEPN) neurons drive these LHb responses, but this influence remains untested. We find that both rEPN and LHb neurons in rats exhibit similar activation/inhibition patterns after negative/positive motivational stimuli, but that the rEPN influence on LHb firing is surprisingly selective. Temporary rEPN inactivation decreases LHb basal and burst firing, and eliminates LHb responses to footshock-predictive cues occurring 40-100ms but not 10-30ms post-stimulus, nor on responses to positive/neutral motivational stimuli. Additionally, rEPN inactivation partially but not fully reduces LHb responses to signaled footshocks, while excitotoxic rEPN lesions only partially diminish footshock-induced cFos in the LHb and its rostromedial tegmental nucleus targets. Together, our findings indicate an important but selective role of the rEPN in driving LHb responses to motivational stimuli.",

Loss of function in any subunit of the heterotrimeric KIF3A/KIF3B/KAP kinesin-2 motor prevents ciliogenesis in mammalian cells and has hindered an understanding of how kinesin-2 motors function in IFT. We used a chemical-genetic approach to engineer an inhibitable KIF3A/KIF3B (i3A/i3B) kinesin-2 motor that is capable of rescuing WT motor function in Kif3a/Kif3b double-knockout cells. Inhibitor addition blocks ciliogenesis or, if added to ciliated cells, blocks IFT within two minutes, which leads to a complete loss of primary cilia within six hours. The kinesin-2 family members KIF3A/KIF3C and KIF17 cannot rescue ciliogenesis in Kif3a/Kif3b double-knockout cells nor delay the disassembly of full-formed cilia upon i3A/i3B inhibition. These data suggest that KIF3A/KIF3B/KAP is the sole and essential motor for cilia assembly and function in mammalian cells, indicating a species-specific adaptation of kinesin-2 motors for IFT function.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations cause severe congenital diseases but may also be associated with healthy aging. MtDNA is stochastically replicated and degraded, and exists within organelles which undergo dynamic fusion and fission. The role of the resulting mitochondrial networks in the time evolution of the cellular proportion of mutated mtDNA molecules (heteroplasmy), and cell-to-cell variability in heteroplasmy (heteroplasmy variance), remains incompletely understood. Heteroplasmy variance is particularly important since it modulates the number of pathological cells in a tissue. Here, we provide the first wide-reaching theoretical framework which bridges mitochondrial network and genetic states. We show that, under a range of conditions, the (genetic) rate of increase in heteroplasmy variance and de novo mutation are proportionally modulated by the (physical) fraction of unfused mitochondria, independently of the absolute fission-fusion rate. In the context of selective fusion, we show that intermediate fusion/fission ratios are optimal for the clearance of mtDNA mutants. Our findings imply that modulating network state, mitophagy rate and copy number to slow down heteroplasmy dynamics when mean heteroplasmy is low could have therapeutic advantages for mitochondrial disease and healthy aging.",

We demonstrate that depletion of MYO1C induces Golgi apparatus fragmentation and decompaction.

Interestingly, MYO1C depletion leads to loss of cellular F-actin, and Golgi apparatus decompaction is also observed after the inhibition or loss of the Arp2/3 complex.

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a central component of the cytoprotective cellular stress response. To enlighten stress-induced autophagy signaling, we screened a human kinome siRNA library for regulators of autophagic flux in MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells and identified the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) as a positive regulator of basal and DNA damage-induced autophagy. Analysis of autophagy-regulating signaling cascades placed DNA-PKcs upstream of the AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) and ULK1 kinase. In normal culture conditions, DNA-PKcs interacted with AMPK and phosphorylated its nucleotide-sensing {gamma}{gamma}1 subunit at Ser-192 and Thr-284, both events being significantly reduced upon AMPK activation. Alanine substitutions of DNA-PKcs phosphorylation sites in AMPK{gamma}{gamma}1 reduced AMPK activation without affecting its nucleotide sensing capacity. Instead, the disturbance of DNA-PKcs-mediated phosphorylation of AMPK{gamma}{gamma} inhibited the lysosomal localization of the AMPK complex and its starvation-induced association with LKB1. Taken together, our data suggest that DNA-PKcs-mediated phosphorylation of AMPK{gamma}{gamma} primes AMPK complex to the lysosomal activation by LKB1 thereby linking DNA damage response to autophagy and cellular metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The corpus luteum (CL) is a transient endocrine gland that synthesizes and secretes the steroid hormone, progesterone. Progesterone biosynthesis is a complex process, converting cholesterol via a series of enzymatic reactions, into progesterone. Lipid droplets in luteal cells store cholesterol in the form of cholesterol esters, which can be utilized for steroidogenesis. In small luteal cells, luteinizing hormone (LH) increases intracellular cAMP concentrations leading to activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates downstream proteins, such as hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). Phosphorylation of HSL at Ser563 leads to increased HSL activation and association with lipid droplets, events which theoretically release cholesterol, which can be used for progesterone synthesis. Bovine CL were obtained from a local abattoir, dispersed, and luteal cells were enriched for SLC via centrifugal elutriation. Our results reveal that LH, forskolin, and cAMP induce HSL phosphorylation at Ser563and Ser660. Moreover, inhibiting HSL activity attenuates LH-induced P4 synthesis. Confocal analysis revealed that LH stimulates translocation of HSL to lipid droplets and mitochondria. Furthermore, LH increased trafficking of cholesterol from the lipid droplets to the mitochondria which was dependent on both PKA and HSL activation. These results demonstrate cholesterol stored in lipid droplets are utilized for LH-induced progesterone biosynthesis. Likewise, PKA-induced activation of HSL is required for release and trafficking of cholesterol from the lipid droplets to the mitochondria. Taken together, these findings support a role for a PKA/HSL signaling pathway in response to LH and demonstrate the dynamic relationship between PKA, HSL, and the lipid droplets in the synthesis of progesterone.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LILH and PKA induce HSL phosphorylation at Ser563and Ser660\\nC_LIO_LIHSL is required for optimal LH-induced P4 synthesis\\nC_LIO_LILH stimulates translocation of HSL to lipid droplets and mitochondria\\nC_LIO_LILH stimulated trafficking of cholesterol from lipid droplets to mitochondria\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "ERK2 is a kinase protein that belongs to a Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway, which is activated in response to a range of extracellular signals. Malfunctioning of this cascade leads to variety of serious diseases, including cancers. This is often caused by mutations in proteins belonging to the cascade, frequently leading to abnormally high activity of the cascade even in the absence of external signal. One such gain-of-function mutation in ERK2 protein, called a sevenmaker mutation (D319N), was discovered in 1994 in Drosophila. This mutation leads to disruption of interactions of other proteins with D-site of ERK2 and results, contrary to expectations, in increase of its activity in vivo. However, no molecular mechanism to explain this effect has been presented so far. The difficulty is that this mutation should equally negatively affect interactions of ERK2 with all substrates, activators and deactivators. In this paper, we present a quantitative kinetic network model that gives a possible explanation of the increased activity of mutant ERK2 species. A simplified biochemical network for ERK2, viewed as a system of coupled Michaelis-Menten processes, is presented. Its dynamic properties are calculated explicitly using the method of first-passage processes. The effect of mutation is associated with changes in the strength of interaction energy between the enzyme and the substrates. It is found that the dependence of kinetic properties of the protein on the interaction energy is non-monotonic, suggesting that some mutations might lead to more efficient catalytic properties, despite weakening inter-molecular interactions. Our theoretical predictions agree with experimental observations for the sevenmaker mutation in ERK2. It is also argued that the effect of mutations might depend on the concentrations of substrates.",

    "abstract": "The Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Cancer Stem Cell (CSC) formation are two paramount processes driving tumor progression, therapy resistance and cancer metastasis. Some recent experiments show that cells with varying EMT and CSC phenotypes are spatially segregated in the primary tumor. The underlying mechanisms generating such spatiotemporal dynamics and heterogeneity in the tumor micro-environment, however, remain largely unexplored. Here, we show through a mechanism-based dynamical model that the diffusion of EMT-inducing signals such as TGF-{beta} in a tumor tissue, together with non-cell autonomous control of EMT and CSC decision-making via juxtacrine signaling mediated via the Notch signaling pathway, can explain experimentally observed disparate localization of subsets of CSCs with varying EMT states in the tumor. Our simulations show that the more mesenchymal CSCs lie at the invasive edge, while the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) CSCs reside in the tumor interior. Further, motivated by the role of Notch-Jagged signaling in mediating EMT and stemness, we investigated the microenvironmental factors that promote Notch-Jagged signaling. We show that many inflammatory cytokines that can promote Notch-Jagged signaling such as IL-6 can (a) stabilize a hybrid E/M phenotype, (b) increase the likelihood of spatial proximity of hybrid E/M cells, and (c) expand the fraction of CSCs. To validate the predicted connection between Notch-Jagged signaling and stemness, we knocked down JAG1 in hybrid E/M SUM149 human breast cancer cells in vitro. JAG1 knockdown significantly restricted organoid formation, confirming the key role that Notch-Jagged signaling can play in tumor progression. Together, our integrated computational-experimental framework reveals the underlying principles of spatiotemporal dynamics of EMT and CSCs in the tumor microenvironment.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe presence of heterogeneous subsets of cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains a clinical challenge. These subsets often occupy different regions in the primary tumor and have varied epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypes. Here, we device a theoretical framework to investigate how the tumor microenvironment (TME) modulates this spatial patterning. We find that a spatial gradient of EMT-inducing signal, coupled with juxtacrine Notch-JAG1 signaling triggered by inflammatory cytokines in TME, explains this spatial heterogeneity. Finally, in vitro JAG1 knockdown experiments in triple negative breast cancer cells severely restricts the growth of tumor organoid, hence validating the association between JAG1 and CSC fraction. Our results offer insights into principles of spatiotemporal patterning in TME, and identifies a relevant target to alleviate multiple CSC subsets - JAG1.",

DNM1 is upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in a manner dependent on expression of GOF mutant p53. Perimeter APPL1 endosomes are required for rapid recycling of EGFR and {beta}1 integrins and modulate Akt signaling and Dyn1 activation to create the positive feedback loop that culminates in increased focal adhesion turnover and cell migration. Thus, Dyn1- and Akt-dependent perimeter APPL1 endosomes function as a nexus, integrating signaling and receptor trafficking, that can be co-opted by cancer cells for mutant p53-driven migration and invasion.",

It is critical to study neural activity in unrestricted animals, and the field would benefit from the inclusion of ethological approaches to studying the neural circuitry of behavior. We therefore adapted Neuropixels probes for chronically-implanted experiments in freely moving mice. We demonstrate the ease and utility of this approach in recording hundreds of neurons across weeks, and provide the methodological details for other researchers to do the same. Importantly, our approach enables researchers to explant and reuse these valuable probes.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged cold exposure stimulates the recruitment of beige adipocytes within white adipose tissue. Beige adipocytes depend on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to drive thermogenesis. The transcriptional mechanisms that promote remodeling in adipose tissue are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that the transcriptional coregulator TLE3 is induced with aging and inhibits mitochondrial gene expression in beige adipocytes. Conditional deletion of TLE3 in adipocytes prevents age- and diet-induced weight gain by promoting mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and increasing energy expenditure, thereby improving glucose control. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing we found that TLE3 occupies distal enhancers in proximity to nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and that many of these enhancers are also enriched for EBF transcription factors. TLE3 interacts with EBF2 and blocks its ability to promote the thermogenic transcriptional program. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that TLE3 mediates age-dependent beige adipose thermogenic decline through inhibition of EBF2 transcriptional activity. Inhibition of TLE3 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for obesity and diabetes.",

    "abstract": "The origins of multicellular physiology are tied to evolution of gene expression. Genes can shift expression as organisms evolve, but how ancestral expression influences altered descendant expression is not well understood. To examine this, we amalgamated 1,903 RNA-seq datasets from 182 research projects, including 6 organs in 21 vertebrate species. Quality control eliminated project-specific biases, and expression shifts were reconstructed using gene-family-wise phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. Expression shifts following gene duplication result in more drastic changes in expression properties than shifts without gene duplication. The expression properties were tightly coupled with protein evolutionary rate, depending on whether and how gene duplication occurred. Fluxes in expression patterns among organs were nonrandom, forming modular connections which were reshaped by gene duplication. Thus, if expression shifted, ancestral expression in some organs induces a strong propensity for expression in particular organs in descendants. This supports a major role for what might be termed \"preadaptive\" pathways of gene expression evolution.",

Although it is perfectly sensible from a statistical perspective, that strategy fails to convey useful information about the level of uncertainty associated to the inference. The present study introduces a new criterion for ancestral nucleotide reconstruction that selects a single state whenever the signal conveyed by the data is strong, and a combination of multiple states otherwise.

Type 2 Topoisomerase (TopoII) enzymes play an important role in this process but the precise mechanisms yielding systematic disentanglement of DNA in vivo are not clear. Here we report computational evidence that Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) proteins - such as cohesins and condensins - can cooperate with TopoII to establish a synergistic mechanism to resolve topological entanglements: SMC-driven loop extrusion (or diffusion) induces the spatial localisation of entanglements in turn increasing the topological pressure within knotted or linked regions. As a consequence, knots, links and ensuing entanglements may be readily simplified by Topoisomerase enzymes even in crowded and confined conditions. The mechanism we uncover is universal in that it does not qualitatively depend on the specific substrate, whether DNA or chromatin, or on the processivity of the SMC proteins; we thus argue that this synergy may be at work across organisms and throughout the cell cycle.",

Here we describe two genomic loci that are unmethylated specifically in intestinal epithelial cells, allowing for sensitive and specific detection of DNA derived from such cells. As expected, intestinal DNA is found in stool, but not in plasma, of healthy individuals. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have minimal amounts of intestinal cfDNA in the plasma, whereas patients with advanced CRC show a strong signal. The intestinal markers are not elevated in plasma samples from patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and a combination of intestine- and pancreas-specific markers allowed for robust differentiation between plasma cfDNA derived from CRC and PDAC patients.

Paneth cell abnormalities are unfortunately detrimental to gut health and often associated with digestive pathologies such as Crohns disease or infections. Similar alterations are observed in individuals with impaired autophagy, a process which recycles cellular components. The direct effect of autophagy-impairment on Paneth cells has not been analysed. To investigate this, we generated a mouse model lacking Atg16l1 specifically in intestinal epithelial cells making these cells impaired in autophagy. Using 3D intestinal organoids enriched for Paneth cells, we compared the proteomic profiles of wild-type (WT) and autophagy-impaired organoids. We used an integrated computational approach combining protein-protein interaction networks, autophagy targeted proteins and functional information to identify the mechanistic link between autophagy-impairment and disrupted pathways. Of the 284 altered proteins, 198 (70%) were more abundant in autophagy-impaired organoids, suggesting reduced protein degradation. Interestingly, these differentially abundant proteins comprised 116 proteins (41%), predicted targets of the selective autophagy proteins p62, LC3 and ATG16L1. Our integrative analysis revealed autophagy-mediated mechanisms degrading proteins key to Paneth cell functions, such as exocytosis, apoptosis and DNA damage repair. Transcriptomic profiling of additional organoids confirmed that 90% of the observed changes upon autophagy alteration affect protein level and not gene expression. We performed further validation experiments showing differential lysozyme secretion, confirming our computationally inferred down-regulation of exocytosis. Our observations could explain how protein level alterations affect Paneth cell homeostatic functions upon autophagy impairment.",

While most clitellate species reproduce by cross-fertilization, self-fertilization has been described within the speciose genus Helobdella. Here we document the reproductive life histories and reproductive capacities for three other Helobdella species. Under laboratory conditions, both H. robusta and H. octatestisaca exhibit uniparental reproduction, apparently reflecting self-fertility, and suggesting that this trait is ancestral for the genus. However, the third species, H. austinensis, seems incapable of reproduction by self-fertilization, so we inferred its reproductive life history by analyzing reproduction in breeding cohorts. Comparing the reproductive parameters for H. robusta reproducing in isolation and in cohorts revealed that reproduction in cohorts is dramatically delayed with respect to that of isolated individuals, and that cohorts of leeches coordinate their cocoon deposition in a manner that is not predicted from the reproductive parameters of individuals reproducing in isolation. Finally, our comparisons of reproductive capacity for individuals versus cohorts for H. robusta, and between different sizes of cohorts for H. austinensis, reveal differences in resource allocation between male and female reproductive roles that are consistent with evolutionary theory.",

Here, we have reproduced this behavior under controlled circumstances, by allowing leeches to step about freely on a range of silicon carbide sandpaper substrates. To begin to understand the neural mechanisms underlying this texture preference behavior, we have determined relevant parameters of leech behavior both on uniform substrates of varying textures, and in a behavior choice paradigm in which the leech is confronted with a choice between rougher and smoother substrate textures at each step. We tested two non-exclusive mechanisms which could produce substrate texture preference: 1) a Diffusion Trap mechanism, in which a leech is more likely to stop moving on a smooth surface than on a rough one, and; 2) an Anterior Choice mechanism, in which a leech is more likely to attach its front sucker (prerequisite for taking a step) to a smooth surface than to a rough one. We propose that both mechanisms contribute to the texture preference exhibited by leeches.",

    "abstract": "The gastrointestinal colonizer Enterococcus faecium is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. faecium are particularly concerning for infection treatment. Previous comparative genomic studies revealed that subspecies referred to as Clade A and Clade B exist within E. faecium. MDR E. faecium belong to Clade A, while Clade B consists of drug-susceptible fecal commensal E. faecium. Isolates from Clade A are further grouped into two sub-clades, A1 and A2. In general, Clade A1 isolates are hospital epidemic isolates whereas Clade A2 isolates are isolates from animals and sporadic human infections. Such phylogenetic separation indicates that reduced gene exchange occurs between the clades. We hypothesize that endogenous barriers to gene exchange exist between E. faecium clades. Restriction-modification (R-M) systems are such barriers in other microbes. We utilized bioinformatics analysis coupled with second generation and third generation deep sequencing platforms to characterize the methylome of two representative E. faecium strains, one from Clade A1 and one from Clade B. We identified a Type I R-M system that is Clade A1-specific, is active for DNA methylation, and significantly reduces transformability of Clade A1 E. faecium. Based on our results, we conclude that R-M systems act as barriers to horizontal gene exchange in E. faecium and propose that R-M systems contribute to E. faecium subspecies separation.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEEnterococcus faecium is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections around the world. Rising antibiotic resistance in certain E. faecium lineages leaves fewer treatment options. The overarching aim of the attached work was to determine whether restriction-modification (R-M) systems contribute to the structure of the E. faecium species, wherein hospital-epidemic and non-hospital-epidemic isolates have distinct evolutionary histories and highly resolved clade structures. R-M provides bacteria with a type of innate immunity to horizontal gene transfer (HGT). We identified a Type I R-M system that is enriched in the hospital-epidemic clade and determined that it is active for DNA modification activity and significantly impacts HGT. Overall, this work is important because it provides a mechanism for the observed clade structure of E. faecium as well as a mechanism for facilitated gene exchange among hospital-epidemic E. faecium.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications, such as N{varepsilon}-lysine acetylation, regulate protein function. N{varepsilon}-lysine acetylation can occur either non-enzymatically or enzymatically. The non-enzymatic mechanism uses acetyl phosphate (AcP) or acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) as acetyl donors to modify an N{varepsilon}-lysine residue of a protein. The enzymatic mechanism uses N{varepsilon}-lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) to specifically transfer an acetyl group from AcCoA to N{varepsilon}-lysine residues on proteins. To date, only one KAT (YfiQ, also known as Pka and PatZ) has been identified in E. coli. Here, we demonstrate the existence of 4 additional E. coli KATs: RimI, YiaC, YjaB, and PhnO. In a genetic background devoid of all known acetylation mechanisms (most notably AcP and YfiQ) and one deacetylase (CobB), overexpression of these putative KATs elicited unique patterns of protein acetylation. We mutated key active site residues and found that most of them eliminated enzymatic acetylation activity. We used mass spectrometry to identify and quantify the specificity of YfiQ and the four novel KATs. Surprisingly, our analysis revealed a high degree of substrate specificity. The overlap between KAT-dependent and AcP-dependent acetylation was extremely limited, supporting the hypothesis that these two acetylation mechanisms play distinct roles in the post-translational modification of bacterial proteins. We further showed that these novel KATs are conserved across broad swaths of bacterial phylogeny. Finally, we determined that one of the novel KATs (YiaC) and the known KAT (YfiQ) can negatively regulate bacterial migration. Together, these results emphasize distinct and specific non-enzymatic and enzymatic protein acetylation mechanisms present in bacteria.\\n\\nImportanceN{varepsilon}-lysine acetylation is one of the most abundant and important post-translational modifications across all domains of life. One of the best-studied effects of acetylation occurs in eukaryotes, where acetylation of histone tails activates gene transcription. Although bacteria do not have true histones, N{varepsilon}-lysine acetylation is prevalent; however, the role of these modifications is mostly unknown. We constructed an E. coli strain that lacked both known acetylation mechanisms to identify four new N{varepsilon}-lysine acetyltransferases (RimI, YiaC, YjaB, and PhnO). We used mass spectrometry to determine the substrate specificity of these acetyltransferases. Structural analysis of selected substrate proteins revealed site-specific preferences for enzymatic acetylation that had little overlap with the preferences of the previously reported acetyl-phosphate non-enzymatic acetylation mechanism. Finally, YiaC and YfiQ appear to regulate flagellar-based motility, a phenotype critical for pathogenesis of many organisms. These acetyltransferases are highly conserved and reveal deeper and more complex roles for bacterial post-translational modification.",

Several methods of realized{Delta} Gt estimation have been utilized in other studies, but none have been objectively evaluated in a plant breeding context. Stochastic simulations of 80 rice (Oryza sativa) breeding programs over 28 years were done to generate data used to evaluate five methods of realized{Delta} Gt estimation in terms of error, precision, efficiency and correlation between true and predicted annual mean breeding values. Two indicators of{Delta} Gt, the expected{Delta} Gt and the average number of equivalent complete generations (EqCg), were described and evaluated. At best, estimates of realized{Delta} Gt were over or underestimated by 15% and 27% when considering all 28 years and the past 15 years of breeding respectively. The best methods were the control population, estimated breeding value, and ERA trial methods. Among these, correlations between true and estimated{Delta} Gt were at best 0.59, indicating that these methods cannot very accurately rank breeding programs in terms of realized{Delta} Gt. The expected{Delta} Gt and the average EqCg were shown to be useful indicators for determining if a non-zero genetic gain is expected.

    "abstract": "The immune system is controlled by a balanced interplay among specialized cell types transitioning between resting and stimulated states. Despite its importance, the regulatory landscape of this system has not yet been fully characterized. To address this gap, we collected ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data under resting and stimulated conditions for 25 immune cell types from peripheral blood of four healthy individuals, and seven cell types from three fetal thymus samples. We found that stimulation caused widespread chromatin remodeling, including a large class of response elements shared between stimulated B and T cells. Furthermore, several autoimmune traits showed significant heritability in stimulation-responsive elements from distinct cell types, highlighting the critical importance of these cell states in autoimmunity. Use of allele-specific read-mapping identified thousands of variants that alter chromatin accessibility in particular conditions. Notably, variants associated with changes in stimulation-specific chromatin accessibility were not enriched for associations with gene expression regulation in whole blood - a tissue commonly used in eQTL studies. Thus, large-scale maps of variants associated with gene regulation lack a condition important for understanding autoimmunity. As a proof-of-principle we identified variant rs6927172, which links stimulated T cell-specific chromatin dysregulation in the TNFAIP3 locus to ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Overall, our results provide a broad resource of chromatin landscape dynamics and highlight the need for large-scale characterization of effects of genetic variation in stimulated cells.",

    "abstract": "An intriguing question in medical biology is how mutations in functionally distinct genes can lead to similar clinical phenotypes. For example, patients with mutations in distinct epigenetic regulators EHMT1, MBD5, MLL3 or SMARCB1 share the core clinical features of intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and facial dysmorphisms. To elucidate how these phenotypic similarities are reflected by convergence at the molecular, cellular and neuronal network level, we directly compared the effects of their loss of function in neurons. Interestingly, knockdown of each gene resulted in hyperactive neuronal networks with altered patterns of synchronized activity. At the single-cell level, we found genotype-specific changes in intrinsic excitability and excitatory-inhibitory balance, but in all cases leading to increased excitability. Congruent with our physiological findings, we identified dysregulated genes that converge on biological and cellular pathways related to neuronal excitability and synaptic function, including genes previously implicated in ID/ASD. Yet, our data suggests that the common cellular phenotypes depend on the ensemble of dysregulated genes engaged in neuronal excitability rather than the direction of transcriptional changes of individual genes. The demonstration of increasing convergence from molecular pathways to neuronal networks may be a paradigm for other types of ID/ASD.",

Both relations are described by the same mathematical operation. This operation is commonly used in image processing, where it generates a blurring effect. Therefore the rate of last fossil occurrences can be taken as a blurred version of the extinction rate, and the time averaged fossil occurrence rate as a blurred version of the fossil occurrence rate. This connection has different applications. It allows to study the patterns different types of time averaging generate or the patterns of last fossil occurrences generated by different extinction rates. More importantly, it opens the possibility to use algorithms from image processing that reverse blurring effects for geological applications. This can be used to reverse the effects of time averaging or to reconstruct extinction rates from the rate of last fossil occurrences.",

Previous reports showed that the SKI complex is involved in the 3-5 degradation of mRNA, including 3 untranslated regions (UTRs), devoid of ribosomes. Paradoxically, we recently showed that the SKI complex directly interacts with ribosomes during the co-translational mRNA decay and that this interaction is necessary for its RNA degradation promoting activity. Here, we characterized a new SKI-associated factor, Ska1, which antagonizes the SKI-ribosome interaction. We showed that the SKI-Ska1-subcomplex is specifically involved in the degradation of ribosome-free RNA regions such as long mRNA 3UTRs and cytoplasmic lncRNAs. We propose a model in which the SKI-exosome complex first targets ribosome-free RNA 3ends in its Ska1-associated form. When the complex reaches the mRNA coding sequence, the Ska1-SKI-exosome complex is exchanged for the SKI-exosome, which interacts directly with ribosomes in order to resume the degradation process.",

    "abstract": "PurposeSpinal cord MRI at ultra-high field is hampered by time-varying magnetic fields associated with the breathing cycle, giving rise to ghosting artifacts in multi-shot acquisitions. Here, we suggest a correction approach based on linking the signal from a respiratory bellows to field changes inside the spinal cord. The information is used to correct the data at the image reconstruction level.\\n\\nMethodsThe correction was demonstrated in the context of multi-shot T2*-weighted imaging of the cervical spinal cord at 7T. A respiratory trace was acquired during a high-resolution multi-echo gradient-echo sequence, used for structural imaging and quantitative T2* mapping, and a multi-shot EPI time series, as would be suitable for fMRI. The coupling between the trace and the breathing-induced fields was determined by a short calibration scan in each individual. Images were reconstructed with and without trace-based correction.\\n\\nResultsIn the multi-echo GRE, breathing-induced fields caused severe ghosting in the long echo time images, which led to a systematic underestimation of T2* in the spinal cord. The trace-based correction reduced the ghosting and increased the estimated T2* values. Breathing-related ghosting was also observed in the multi-shot EPI images. The correction largely removed the ghosting, thereby improving the temporal signal-to-noise ratio of the time series.\\n\\nConclusionsTrace-based retrospective correction of breathing-induced field variations can reduce ghosting and improve quantitative metrics in multi-shot structural and functional T2*-weighted imaging of the spinal cord. The method is straightforward to implement and does not rely on sequence modifications or additional hardware beyond a respiratory bellows.",

    "abstract": "The plasma membrane is at the interface of plant-pathogen interactions and thus many bacterial type-III effector proteins (T3Es) target membrane-associated processes to interfere with immunity. The Pseudomonas syringae T3E is a host cell plasma membrane (PM)-localized effector protein that has several immunity associated host targets but also activates effector triggered immunity (ETI) in resistant backgrounds. Although HopZ1a has been shown to interfere with early defense signaling at the PM, no dedicated plasma membrane-associated HopZ1a target protein has been identified until now. We show here, that HopZ1a interacts with the PM-associated remorin protein NbREM4 from Nicotiana benthamiana in several independent assays. NbREM4 re-localizes to membrane sub-domains after treatment with the bacterial elicitor flg22 and transient overexpression of NbREM4 in N. benthamiana induces the expression of a subset of defense related genes. We can further show that NbREM4 interacts with the immune-related receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase PBS1 and is phosphorylated by PBS1 on several residues in vitro. Thus, we conclude that NbREM4 is associated with early defense signaling at the PM. The possible relevance of the HopZ1a/NbREM4 interaction for HopZ1a virulence and avirulence functions is discussed.",

    "abstract": "FUS is a multifunctional protein involved in many steps of RNA metabolism, including transcription, splicing, miRNA processing and replication-dependent histone gene expression. In this paper, we show for the first time that FUS binds and negatively regulates the levels of a subset of snoRNAs in cells. Scanning of available human small RNA databases revealed the existence of smaller RNA fragments that can be processed from FUS-dependent snoRNAs. Therefore, we suggest that FUS mediates the biogenesis of snoRNA-derived small RNAs, called sdRNAs. Further in silico approaches enabled us to predict putative targets of selected FUS-dependent sdRNAs. Our results indicate that sdRNAs may bind to different regions of target mRNAs as well as to noncoding transcripts and influence the posttranscriptional level or translation of these targets.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRNA metabolism is orchestrated by a complex network of RNA-protein interactions and involves various classes of RNA molecules. Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are commonly considered essential components of the ribosome biogenesis pathway. However, recent studies have revealed that snoRNAs can also be fragmented into small entities called snoRNA-derived RNAs (sdRNAs), which have been linked to multiple cancer types and thus may serve as next-generation prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers. In this paper, a multifunctional protein, FUS, was shown to be involved in the biogenesis of snoRNA-derived fragments. Furthermore, we combined bioinformatic analyses with complementary experimental approaches to elucidate the role of FUS-dependent sdRNAs in gene expression regulation. Our findings reveal the considerable regulatory potential of this new class of small noncoding RNAs.",

Here, we describe a highly generalisable statistical platform to infer the dynamic pathways by which many, potentially interacting, discrete traits are acquired or lost over time in biological processes. The platform uses HyperTraPS (hypercubic transition path sampling) to learn progression pathways from cross-sectional, longitudinal, or phylogenetically-linked data with unprecedented efficiency, readily distinguishing multiple competing pathways, and identifying the most parsimonious mechanisms underlying given observations. Its Bayesian structure quantifies uncertainty in pathway structure and allows interpretable predictions of behaviours, such as which symptom a patient will acquire next. We exploit the models topology to provide visualisation tools for intuitive assessment of multiple, variable pathways. We apply the method to ovarian cancer progression and the evolution of multidrug resistance in tuberculosis, demonstrating its power to reveal previously undetected dynamic pathways.",

    "abstract": "Recognition of nucleic acids enables detection of diverse pathogens by a limited number of innate immune receptors but also exposes the host to potential autoimmunity. At least two members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, TLR7 and TLR9, can recognize self RNA or DNA, respectively. Despite the structural and functional similarities between these receptors, their contribution to autoimmune diseases such as SLE can be quite different. However, mechanisms of negative regulation that differentiate between TLR7 and TLR9 have not been described. Here we report a new function for the TLR trafficking chaperone Unc93b1 that specifically limits TLR7 signaling and prevents TLR7-dependent autoimmunity. Unc93b1 is known to traffic TLRs from the endoplasmic reticulum to endosomes, but this new regulatory function does not affect TLR7 localization. Instead, Unc93b1 recruits Syntenin-1, which inhibits TLR7, but not TLR9, signaling. Syntenin-1 binding requires phosphorylation of two serine residues on Unc93b1, providing a mechanism for dynamic regulation of the activation threshold of TLR7. Disruption of the Unc93b1/Syntenin-1 interaction in mice results in TLR7-dependent autoimmunity. Thus, Unc93b1 not only enables proper trafficking of nucleic acid sensing TLRs but also sets the activation threshold of these potentially self-reactive receptors.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNucleic acid-sensing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are subject to complex regulation to facilitate recognition of microbial DNA and RNA while limiting recognition of self-nucleic acids1. Failure to properly regulate nucleic acid-sensing TLRs can lead to autoimmune and autoinflammatory disease2-6. Intracellular localization of these receptors is thought to be critical for self vs. non-self discrimination7, yet the molecular mechanisms that reinforce compartmentalized activation of intracellular TLRs remain poorly understood. Here we describe a new mechanism that prevents TLR9 activation from locations other than endosomes. This control is achieved through the regulated release of TLR9 from its trafficking chaperone Unc93b1, which only occurs within endosomes and is required for ligand binding and signal transduction. Mutations in Unc93b1 that increase affinity for TLR9 impair release and result in defective signaling. The release is specific to TLR9, as TLR7 does not dissociate from Unc93b1 in endosomes. This work defines a novel checkpoint that reinforces self vs. non-self discrimination by TLR9 and provides a mechanism by which TLR9 and TLR7 activation can be distinctly regulated.",

    "abstract": "Technology has led to rapid progress in the identification of genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorders like intellectual disability (ID), but our functional understanding of the causative genes is lagging. Here, we show that the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is one of the most overrepresented cellular components disrupted in ID. We systematically investigated the role of individual subunits of this large protein complex in post-mitotic memory forming neurons of the Drosophila mushroom body (MB). Using this approach, we have identified novel differential roles for the two prominent conformations of the Drosophila SWI/SNF complex, known as BAP and PBAP. The PBAP conformation is required post-mitotically for remodeling of the MB {gamma} neurons during morphogenesis and is essential for both short and long-term memory. In contrast, the BAP conformation appears to preferentially effect long-term memory and is associated with {gamma} neuron survival. Our results suggest that different subunits of the SWI/SNF complex may influence learning and memory through diverse and distinct roles in regulating structural plasticity, survival, and functionality of post-mitotic neurons. This study provides novel insight into the neuronal function of individual SWI/SNF subunits and will serve as a basis for understanding SWI/SNF-mediated gene regulatory mechanisms in post-mitotic neurons.",
