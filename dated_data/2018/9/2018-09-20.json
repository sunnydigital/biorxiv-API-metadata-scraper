    "abstract": "There is substantial variation in the timing of significant reproductive life events such as menarche and first sexual intercourse. Life history theory explains this variation as an adaptive response to the developmental environment. In environments characterized by harsh conditions, adopting a fast life history strategy may increase fitness. In line with this, there is evidence demonstrating that greater childhood adversity is associated with earlier age at menarche. Here we applied Mendelian randomization (MR) methods to investigate whether there is a causal effect of variation in age at menarche and age at first sexual intercourse on outcomes related to reproduction, education and risky behaviour in UK Biobank (N = 114883-181,255). Our results suggest that earlier age at menarche affects some traits that characterize life history strategies including earlier age at first and last birth, decreased educational attainment, and decreased age at leaving education (for example, we found evidence for a 0.26 year decrease in age at first birth per year decrease in age at menarche, 95% confidence interval: -0.34 to -0.17; p < 0.0001). We find no clear evidence of effects of age at menarche on other outcomes, such as risk taking behaviour. Age at first sexual intercourse was also related to many life history outcomes, although there was evidence of horizontal pleiotropy which violates an assumption of MR and results should be treated with caution. Taken together, these results highlight how MR can be applied to test predictions of life history theory and to better understand determinants of health and social behaviour.",

    "abstract": "We have studied how individual decisions about timing of breeding and nest location affected the reproductive success of rooks by tracing the formation of a rook breeding colony in Hortobagy NP (Hungary), during the breeding season in 1999.\\n\\nWe have found that birds who built nests earlier also laid eggs earlier and had larger clutch size but had no had more offspring than late nesters. Distance of the nest from the centre or edge of the colony did not affect the reproductive success though rooks generally settled closer to the centre and further from the edge than it can be expected by assuming random distribution. The colony showed high breeding synchrony since date of egg laying varied less than date of nesting but synchrony did not influence the breeding success. Hatchlings survival rate and number of offspring increased with local nest density and rooks clustered their nests more than it can be expected by random settlement. Nest sites of early and late nesters did not differ regarding the distance from the centre or the edge of the colony but late nesters chose nest sites in more densely populated regions.\\n\\nThe results indicate that individuals may follow different strategies to increase their reproductive success. It is prospectively advantageous to build the nest and lay eggs earlier, in turn, its worth nesting in already more densely nested areas for late beginners. We suggest that a game theoretical approach may be useful if we try to understand the adaptive significance of colonial breeding.",

    "abstract": "Ikaros family zinc finger protein 1 and 3 (IKZF1 and IKZF3) are transcription factors that promote multiple myeloma (MM) proliferation. The immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD) lenalidomide promotes myeloma cell death via Cereblon (CRBN)-dependent ubiquitylation and proteasome-dependent degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3. Although IMiDs have been used as first-line drugs for MM, the overall survival of refractory MM patients remains poor and demands the identification of novel agents to potentiate the therapeutic effect of IMiDs. Using an unbiased screen based on mass spectrometry, we identified the Runt-related transcription factor 1 and 3 (RUNX1 and RUNX3) as interactors of IKZF1 and IKZF3. Interaction with RUNX1 and RUNX3 inhibits CRBN-dependent binding, ubiquitylation and degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3 upon lenalidomide treatment. Inhibition of RUNXs, via genetic ablation or a small molecule (AI-10-104), results in sensitization of myeloma cell lines and primary tumors to lenalidomide. Thus, RUNX inhibition represents a valuable therapeutic opportunity to potentiate IMiDs therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma.",

    "abstract": "Malaria control programs face difficult resource allocation decisions. Of particular concern for countries aiming for malaria elimination, the regular movement of individuals to and from endemic areas undermines local interventions by reintroducing infections and sustaining local transmission. Quantifying this movement of malaria parasites around a country has become a priority for national control programs, but remains methodologically challenging, particularly in areas with highly mobile populations. Here, we combined multiple data sources to measure the geographical spread of malaria parasites, including epidemiological surveillance data, travel surveys, parasite genetic data, and anonymized mobile phone data. We collected parasite genetic barcodes and travel surveys from 2,090 patients residing in 176 unions in southeast Bangladesh. We developed a genetic mixing index to quantify the likelihood of samples being local or imported. We then inferred the direction and intensity of parasite flow between locations using an epidemiological model, and estimated the proportion of imported cases assuming mobility patterns parameterized using the travel survey and mobile phone calling data. Our results show that each data source provided related but different information about the patterns of geographic spread of parasites. We identify a consistent north/south separation of the Chittagong Hill Tracts region in Bangladesh, and found that in addition to imported infections from forested regions, frequent mixing also occurs in low transmission but highly populated areas in the southwest. Thus, unlike risk maps generated from incidence alone, our maps provide evidence that elimination programs must address ongoing movement of parasites around the lower transmission areas in the southwest.",

However, sparse serotype-specific counts in epidemiologic datasets may undermine such analyses, most notably for rare serotypes that pose emergence risks in vaccinated populations. This challenge is well-illustrated in Group B streptococcus (GBS), where serotype III dominates in both carriage and disease.\\n\\nMethodsWe develop an empirical Bayes random-effects model based on conjugate Dirichlet-multinomial distributions of serotype frequencies in carriage and disease states. We validate the model using simulated datasets, and apply it to data from 15 paired sets of GBS isolates from intrapartum rectovaginal colonization (n=3403) and neonatal invasive disease (NID; n=1088), 16 from blood (n=2352) and cerebrospinal fluid (n=780) neonatal specimens, and 3 from fatal (n=173) and non-fatal (n=1684) neonatal invasive infections.\\n\\nResultsOur method accurately recovers parameters in simulated datasets. Using this approach, we confirm that GBS serotype III exhibits the greatest invasiveness, followed by serotype Ia with a 75.3% (95%CrI: 43.7-93.8%) lower estimate. Enhanced invasiveness of serotypes III and Ia is most evident in late-onset disease. Non-hexavalent-vaccine serotypes, which are rare in carriage and disease, generally show lower invasiveness; serotype IX/non-typeable GBS, the most prevalent cause of non-vaccine-preventable disease, is 98.7% (81.7-99.9%) and 94.2% (13.9-99.6%) less invasive than serotypes III and Ia, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionsWe present a strategy for measuring associations of serotype with carrier and disease states in the presence of sparse counts, avoiding biases that exist in common ad-hoc approaches.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe parasite Leishmania infantum causes zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a potentially fatal vector-borne disease of canids and humans. Zoonotic VL poses a significant risk to public health, with regions of Latin America being particularly afflicted by the disease.\\n\\nLeishmania infantum parasites are transmitted between hosts during blood feeding by infected female phlebotomine sand flies. With a principal reservoir host of L. infantum being domestic dogs, limiting prevalence in this reservoir may result in a reduced risk of infection for the human population. To this end, a primary focus of research efforts has been to understand disease transmission dynamics among dogs. One way this can be achieved is through the use of mathematical models.\\n\\nMethodsWe have developed a stochastic, spatial, individual-based mechanistic model of L. infantum transmission in domestic dogs. The model framework was applied to a rural Brazilian village setting with parameter values informed by fieldwork and laboratory data. To ensure household and sand fly populations were realistic, we statistically fit distributions for these entities to existing survey data. To identify the model parameters of highest importance, we performed a stochastic parameter sensitivity analysis of the prevalence of infection among dogs to the model parameters.\\n\\nResultsWe computed parametric distributions for the number of humans and animals per household and a non-parametric temporal profile for sand fly abundance. The stochastic parameter sensitivity analysis determined prevalence of L. infantum infection in dogs to be most strongly affected by the sand fly associated parameters and the proportion of immigrant dogs already infected with L. infantum parasites.\\n\\nConclusionsEstablishing the model parameters with the highest sensitivity of average L. infantum infection prevalence in dogs to their variation helps motivate future data collection efforts focusing on these elements. Moreover, the proposed mechanistic modelling framework provides a foundation that can be expanded to explore spatial patterns of zoonotic VL in humans and to assess spatially targeted interventions.",

Cases were defined as children possessing extended-spectrum-cephalosporin-resistant (ESC-R) infections. PCR and DNA analysis assessed beta-lactamase (bla) genes, multi-locus sequence types (MLST) and phylogenetic grouping of E. coli. Controls were children with ESC-susceptible (ESC-S)-Ent infections matched 3:1 by age, source, and hospital. The clinical-epidemiologic predictors of CTX-M-9-grp-Ent infection were assessed.\\n\\nResultsOf 356 ESC-R-Ent isolates from children (median age 4.1 years), CTX-M-9-group was the solely detected bla gene in 44(12.4%). The predominant species was E. coli (91%) of virulent phylogroups D(60%) and B2(40%). MLST revealed multiple strain types. On multivariable analysis, CTX-M-9-grp-Ent occurred more often in E. coli (OR 7.0), children of non-black-white-Hispanic race (OR 6.5), and outpatients (OR 4.5) which was a very unexpected finding for infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Residents of South Chicago were 6.7 times more likely to have CTX-M-9-grp-Ent infections than those in the reference region (West), while residence in Northwestern Chicago was associated with an 81% decreased risk. Other demographic, comorbidity, invasive-device, and antibiotic use differences were not found.\\n\\nConclusionsCTX-M-9-grp-Ent infection is strikingly associated with patient residence and is occurring in children without traditional in-patient exposure risk factors. This suggests that among children, the community environment may be a key contributor in the spread of these resistant pathogens.",

The twelve components demonstrate simple pairwise Pearson correlations to AD, and then are analyzed by PCA for loadings associated with AD. Repetitive factor analysis and the culling of questionable data reduced the factors (all per capita) associated with AD to two, one factor with the components dentists and wine consumption and another factor with the components beer consumption and dentists. Dentists and wine are likely associated with reduced AD incidence because of the known inverse association with elevated education. Dental care is known to be inversely associated with AD incidence. The contribution of beer consumption to AD incidence is likely because of the negative effect on the innate immune system from either phytoestrogens in hops, or detritus from fermentation permitting the fungal colonization seen in AD brains.",

    "abstract": "Anthrax is a potentially life-threatening bacterial disease that can circulate in wild and domestic animals and subsequently spillover to human contacts with devastating consequences for human and animal health, as well as livestock economies and ecosystem conservation. India has a high annual occurrence of anthrax in some regions, but a country-wide delineation of risk has not yet been undertaken. The current study modeled the geographic suitability of anthrax across India and its associated environmental features using a biogeographical application of machine learning. Both biotic and abiotic features contributed to risk across multiple scales of influence and the wildlife-livestock interface, using elephants as a wildlife sentinel species, was the dominant feature in delineating anthrax suitability. In addition, water-soil balance, soil chemistry, and historical forest loss were also influential. These findings suggest that the wildlife-livestock interface plays an important role in the cycling of anthrax in India. Prevention efforts targeted toward this interface, particularly within anthropogenic ecotones, may yield successes in reducing ongoing transmission between animal hosts and subsequent zoonotic transmission to humans.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition in which aberrant oscillatory synchronization of neuronal activity at beta frequencies (15-35 Hz) across the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit is associated with debilitating motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia and rigidity. Mounting evidence suggests that the magnitude of beta synchrony in the parkinsonian state fluctuates over time, but the mechanisms by which thalamocortical circuitry regulates the dynamic properties of cortical beta in PD are poorly understood. Using the recently developed generic dynamic causal modelling framework, we recursively optimised a set of plausible models of the thalamocortical circuit (n=144) to infer the neural mechanisms that best explain the transitions between low and high beta power states observed in recordings of field potentials made in the motor cortex of anesthetized Parkinsonian rats. Bayesian model comparison suggests that upregulation of cortical rhythmic activity in the beta-frequency band results from changes in the coupling strength both between and within the thalamus and motor cortex. Specifically, our model indicates that high levels of cortical beta synchrony are mainly achieved by a delayed (extrinsic) input from thalamic relay cells to deep pyramidal cells and a fast (intrinsic) input from middle pyramidal cells to superficial pyramidal cells. We therefore hypothesize that beta synchronisation at the cortical level could selectively be modulated via interventions that are capable of finely regulating cortical excitability in a spatial (delivered to either the superficial or deep cortical laminae) and time specific manner.",

These include compressive deformations which, although hard to study in model systems due to the confounding effects of the substrate, are thought to play an important role in tissue morphogenesis by inducing tissue folding and by triggering mechanosensitive responses including cell extrusion and cell differentiation. Here, using suspended epithelia, we are able to uncover the immediate response of epithelial tissues to the application of large (5-80%) in-plane compressive strains. We show that fast compression induces tissue buckling followed by active tissue flattening which erases the buckle within tens of seconds. Strikingly, there is a well-defined limit to this second response, so that stable folds form in the tissue for compressive strains larger than [~]35%. Finally, a combination of experiment and modelling shows that the response to compression is orchestrated by the automatic adaptation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton as it re-establishes tension in compressed tissues. Thus, tissue pre-tension allows epithelia to both buffer against fast compression and regulate folding.",

    "abstract": "Over the last 50 years, payment for ecosystem services schemes (PES) have been lauded as a market-based solution to curtail deforestation and restore degraded ecosystems. However, PES programs often fail to conserve sites under strong long-term deforestation pressures and allocate financial resources without having a sizeable impact on long-term land use change. Underperformance, in part, is likely due to adverse selection as landowners with land at the lowest threat from conversion or loss may be most likely to enroll or enrollment may be for short time-periods. Improving program performance to overcome adverse selection requires understanding attributes of landowners and their land across large scales to identify spatial and temporal enrollment patterns that drive adverse selection. In this paper, we examine these patterns in Argentinas PES program in the endangered Chaco forest ecoregion, which was established in 2007 under the National Forest Law. Our study area covers 252,319 km2. Among our most important findings is that large parcels of enrolled land and land owned by absentee landowners show greater evidence of spatiotemporal adverse selection than smaller plots of land and land owned by local actors. Furthermore, lands managed for conservation and restoration are more likely to be associated with adverse selection than lands that provide financial returns such as harvest of non-timber forest products, silviculture, and silvopasture. However, prior to recommending that PES programs focus on land uses with higher potential earnings, a greater understanding is needed of the degree to which these land uses meet ecological and biodiversity goals of PES programs. Because of this, we posit that a PES incorporating a market-based compensation strategy that varies with commodity prices, along with approaches that provide incentives for conservation and restoration land uses and enrollment of local landowners, could promote long-term conservation of endangered lands.",

Genome-wide examination of DNA methylation (DNAm) offers an attractive comple ment to studies of allelic risk given it can reflect the combined influence of genes and environment. The current study used a co-twin control design to identify differentially and variably methylated regions of the genome that distinguish monozygotic (MZ) twins with and without a lifetime history of early-onset MD. The sample included 150 Caucasian monozygotic twins (73% female; Mage=17.52 SD=1.28) assessed during a developmental stage characterized by relatively dis tinct neurophysiological changes. All twins were generally healthy and currently free of medica tions with psychotropic effects. DNAm was measured in peripheral blood cells using the Infinium Human BeadChip 450K Array. MD associations were detected at 760 differentially and variably methylated probes/regions that mapped to 428 genes. Results indicated an association between early-onset MD and many genes and genomic regions involved in neural circuitry formation, pro jection, functioning, and plasticity. Gene enrichment analyses implicated genes related to neuron structures and neurodevelopmental processes including cell-cell adhesion genes (e.g., CDHs, PCDHAs, PCDHA1C/2C). Genes previously implicated in mood and psychiatric disorders as well as chronic stress (e.g., HDAC4, NRG1) also were identified. DNAm regions associated with MD where found to overlap genetic loci observed in the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium meta- analysis of depression. Understanding the time course of epigenetic influences during emerging adulthood may clarify developmental phases where genes modulate individual differences in MD risk.",

    "abstract": "Topoisomerase II (Top2) is an essential enzyme that decatenates DNA via a transient Top2-DNA covalent intermediate. This intermediate can be stabilised by a class of drugs termed Top2 poisons, resulting in massive DNA damage. Thus, Top2 activity is a double-edged sword that needs to be carefully controlled to maintain genome stability. We show that Uls1, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling (Snf2) enzyme, can alter Top2 chromatin binding and prevent Top2 poisoning in yeast. Deletion mutants of ULS1 are hypersensitive to the Top2 poison acriflavine (ACF), activating the DNA damage checkpoint. We map Uls1s Top2 interaction domain and show that this, together with its ATPase activity, is essential for Uls1 function. By performing ChIP-seq, we show that ACF leads to a general increase in Top2 binding across the genome. We map Uls1 binding sites and identify tRNA genes as key regions where Uls1 associates after ACF treatment. Importantly, the presence of Uls1 at these sites prevents ACF-dependent Top2 accumulation. Our data reveal the effect of Top2 poisons on the global Top2 binding landscape and highlights the role of Uls1 in antagonising Top2 function. Remodelling Top2 binding is thus an important new means by which Snf2 enzymes promote genome stability.",

The identification of individuals whose survival time is too short or to long given their profile, assumes great importance for the detection of new prognostic factors. The study of these outlying observations have gained increasing relevancy with the availability of high-throughput molecular and clinical data for large cohorts of patients. Several methods for outlier detection in survival data have been proposed, which include the analysis of the residuals, the measurement of the concordance c-index, and methods based on quantile regression for censored data. However, different results are obtained depending on the type of method used. In order to solve the disparity of results we proposed to apply the Rank Product test. A simulated dataset, and two clinical datasets were used to illustrate our proposed consensus outlier detection method, one from myeloma disease and the other from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian cancer. Finally, the Rank Product with multiple testing corrections was performed in order to identify which observations have the highest rank amongst the methods considered.

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful means to identify associations between genetic variants and phenotypes. However, GWAS techniques for detecting epistasis, the interactions between genetic variants associated with phenotypes, are still limited. We believe that developing an efficient and effective GWAS method to detect epistasis will be a key for discovering sophisticated pathogenesis, which is especially important for complex diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD). In this regard, this study presents GenEpi, a computational package to uncover epistasis associated with phenotypes by the proposed machine learning approach. GenEpi identifies both within-gene and cross-gene epistasis through a two-stage modeling workflow. In both stages, GenEpi adopts two-element combinatorial encoding when producing features and constructs the prediction models by L1-regularized regression with stability selection. The simulated data showed that GenEpi outperforms other widely-used methods on detecting ground-truth epistasis. As real data is concerned, this study uses AD as an example to reveal the capability of GenEpi in finding disease-related variants and variant interactions that show both biological meanings and predictive power.

While this two-gene arrangement is evolutionarily conserved, its origins and function remain unknown.

While H3F3B bears similarities with H3.3 genes in distant organisms and with canonical H3 genes, H3F3A is sarcopterygian-specific and evolves under strong purifying selection. Additionally, H3F3B codon-usage preferences resemble those of broadly expressed genes and  cell differentiation-induced genes, while codon-usage of H3F3A resembles that of  cell proliferation-induced genes. We infer that H3F3B is more similar to the ancestral H3.3 gene and likely evolutionarily adapted for broad expression pattern in diverse cellular programs, while H3F3A adapted for a subset of gene expression programs. Thus, the arrangement of two independent H3.3 genes facilitates fine-tuning of H3.3 expression across cellular programs.",

This creates a detrimental situation from which evolution cannot escape. To determine how this problem materializes in a model with a greater degree of realism than conventional game-theoretical models, we simulate the life and the long-term evolution of a population of individuals playing a two-player coordination game, using the framework of evolutionary robotics. We first confirm the existence of an evolutionary trap in a simple setting. We then, however, reveal that this problem disappears in a more realistic setting where individuals need to coordinate with one another. In this setting, robots evolve an ability to adapt plastically their behavior to one another, as this improves the efficiency of their interaction. This ability has an unintended evolutionary consequence: a genetic mutation affecting one individuals behavior also indirectly alters their partners behavior because the two individuals influence one another, which is called an \\\"indirect genetic effect\\\". Consequently, pairs of partners can virtually change strategy together with a single mutation, and the evolutionary barrier between alternative strategies disappears. This finding reveals a general principle that could play a role in nature to smoothen the transition to efficient collective behaviors in all games with multiple equilibriums.",

    "abstract": "Anatolia was home to some of the earliest farming communities. It has been long debated whether a migration of farming groups introduced agriculture to central Anatolia. Here, we report the first genome-wide data from a 15,000-year-old Anatolian hunter-gatherer and from seven Anatolian and Levantine early farmers. We find high genetic continuity ([~]80-90%) between the hunter-gatherer and early farmers of Anatolia and detect two distinct incoming ancestries: an early Iranian/Caucasus related one and a later one linked to the ancient Levant. Finally, we observe a genetic link between southern Europe and the Near East predating 15,000 years ago that extends to central Europe during the post-last-glacial maximum period. Our results suggest a limited role of human migration in the emergence of agriculture in central Anatolia.",

    "abstract": "Though bacteria in nature are often nutritionally limited and growing slowly, most of our understanding of core cellular processes such as transcription comes from studies in a handful of model organisms doubling rapidly under nutrient-replete conditions. We previously identified a small protein of unknown function, called SutA, in a global screen of proteins synthesized in Pseudomonas aeruginosa under growth arrest (Babin BM, et al. (2016) SutA is a bacterial transcription factor expressed during slow growth in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PNAS 113(5):E597-605). SutA binds RNA polymerase (RNAP), causing widespread changes in gene expression, including upregulation of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Here, using biochemical and structural methods, we examine how SutA interacts with RNAP and the functional consequences of these interactions. We show that SutA consists of a central -helix with unstructured N- and C-terminal tails, and binds to the {beta}1 domain of RNAP. It activates transcription from the P. aeruginosa rrn promoter by both the housekeeping sigma factor holoenzyme (E{sigma}70) and the general stress response sigma factor holoenzyme (E{sigma}S) in vitro, and its N-terminal tail is required for activation in both holoenzyme contexts. However, we find that the interaction between SutA and each holoenzyme is distinct, with the SutA C-terminal tail and an acidic loop unique to {sigma}70 playing the determining roles in these differences. Our results add SutA to a growing list of transcription regulators that use their intrinsically disordered regions to remodel transcription complexes.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCELittle is known about how bacteria regulate their activities during periods of dormancy, yet growth arrest dominates bacterial existence in most environments and is directly relevant to the problem of physiological antibiotic tolerance. Though much is known about transcription in the model organism, Escherichia coli, even there, our understanding of gene expression during dormancy is incomplete. Here we explore how transcription under growth arrest is modulated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by the small acidic protein, SutA. We show that SutA binds to RNA polymerase and controls transcription by a mechanism that is distinct from other known regulators. Our work underscores the potential for fundamental, mechanistic discovery in this important and understudied realm of bacterial physiology.",

    "abstract": "The media components necessary for deriving and sustaining organoids from a number of epithelial tissues such as prostate, colon, gastric, liver, pancreas, and others have been established (1). Critical components of organoid media formulations are a set of growth factors that include EGF, R-spondins and BMP signalling antagonists such as Noggin or Gremlin. The practical limitation to organoid culture and the development of new applications for the technology is the use of defined cellular activities of growth factors in media formulations, in particular Noggin/Gremlin 1 and R-spondin 1. Here we report the production of highly pure recombinant Gremlin 1 and R-spondin 1 from bacterial expression and their use for culturing organoids. We detail the workflow for their purification, determination of cellular activity, quality control and their formulation in organoid media. The protocols we provide for generation of precisely formulated, cost-effective, organoid media of defined cellular activity will enable broader access to organoid technology and engender the development of novel applications.",
