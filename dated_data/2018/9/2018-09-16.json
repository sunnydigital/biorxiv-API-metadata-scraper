    "abstract": "1Life continues to shock and amaze us, reminding us that truth is far stranger than fiction. http://Euplotid.io is a quantized geometric model of the eukaryotic cell, an attempt at quantifying the incredible complexity that gives rise to a living cell by beginning from the smallest unit, a quanta. Starting from the very bottom we are able to build the pieces which when hierarchically and combinatorially combined produce the emergent complex behavior that even a single celled organism can show. Euplotid is composed of a set of quantized geometric 3D building blocks and constantly evolving dockerized bioinformatic pipelines enabling a user to build and interact with the local regulatory architecture of every gene starting from DNA-interactions, chromatin accessibility, and RNA-sequencing. Reads are quantified using the latest computational tools and the results are normalized, quality-checked, and stored. The local regulatory architecture of each gene is built using a Louvain based graph partitioning algorithm parameterized by the chromatin extrusion model and CTCF-CTCF interactions. Cis-Regulatory Elements are defined using chromatin accessibility peaks which are mapped to Transcriptional Start Sites based on inclusion within the same neighborhood. Deep Neural Networks are trained in order to provide a statistical model mimicking transcription factor binding, giving the ability to identify all Transcription Factors within a given chromatin accessibility peak. By in-silico mutating and re-applying the neural network we are able to gauge the impact of a transition mutation on the binding of any transcription factor. The annotated output can be visualized in a variety of 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D ways overlaid with existing bodies of knowledge such as GWAS results or PDB structures. Once a particular CRE of interest has been identified a Base Editor mediated transition mutation can then be performed in a relevant model for further study.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/170159v15_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a55a1borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bebb0dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ea5b11org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100e735_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 0.1:C_FLOATNO Graphical Abstract\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "It is increasingly recognized that Alzheimers disease (AD) exists before dementia is present and that shifts in amyloid beta occur long before clinical symptoms can be detected. Early detection of these molecular changes is a key aspect for the success of interventions aimed at slowing down rates of cognitive decline. Recent evidence indicates that of the two established methods for measuring amyloid, a decrease in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) amyloid {beta}1-42 (A{beta}1-42) may be an earlier indicator of Alzheimers disease risk than measures of amyloid obtained from Positron Emission Topography (PET). However, CSF collection is highly invasive and expensive. In contrast, blood collection is routinely performed, minimally invasive and cheap. In this work, we develop a blood-based signature that can provide a cheap and minimally invasive estimation of an individuals CSF amyloid status using a machine learning approach. We show that a Random Forest model derived from plasma analytes can accurately predict subjects as having abnormal (low) CSF A{beta}1-42 levels indicative of AD risk (0.84 AUC, 0.78 sensitivity, and 0.73 specificity). Refinement of the modeling indicates that only APOE{varepsilon}4 carrier status and four analytes are required to achieve a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, we show across an independent validation cohort that individuals with predicted abnormal CSF A{beta}1-42 levels transitioned to an AD diagnosis over 120 months significantly faster than those predicted with normal CSF A{beta}1-42 levels and that the resulting model also performs reasonably across PET A{beta}1-42 status.\\n\\nThis is the first study to show that a machine learning approach, using plasma protein levels, age and APOE{varepsilon}4 carrier status, is able to predict CSF A{beta}1-42 status, the earliest risk indicator for AD, with high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Outcomes for cancer patients vary greatly even within the same tumor type, and characterization of molecular subtypes of cancer holds important promise for improving prognosis and personalized treatment. This promise has motivated recent efforts to produce large amounts of multidimensional genomic ( multi-omic) data, but current algorithms still face challenges in the integrated analysis of such data. Here we present Cancer Integration via Multikernel Learning (CIMLR), a new cancer subtyping method that integrates multi-omic data to reveal molecular subtypes of cancer. We apply CIMLR to multi-omic data from 36 cancer types and show significant improvements in both computational efficiency and ability to extract biologically meaningful cancer subtypes. The discovered subtypes exhibit significant differences in patient survival for 27 of 36 cancer types. Our analysis reveals integrated patterns of gene expression, methylation, point mutations and copy number changes in multiple cancers and highlights patterns specifically associated with poor patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) provide insight into cellular behavior by describing interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their gene targets. The Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC)-seq, coupled with transcription-factor motif analysis, provides indirect evidence of chromatin binding for hundreds of TFs genome-wide. Here, we propose methods for TRN inference in a mammalian setting, using ATAC-seq data to influence gene expression modeling. We rigorously test our methods in the context of T Helper Cell Type 17 (Th17) differentiation, generating new ATAC-seq data to complement existing Th17 genomic resources (plentiful gene expression data, TF knock-outs and ChIP-seq experiments). In this resource-rich mammalian setting, our extensive benchmarking provides quantitative, genome-scale evaluation of TRN inference combining ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data. We refine and extend our previous Th17 TRN, using our new TRN inference methods to integrate all Th17 data (gene expression, ATAC-seq, TF KO, ChIP-seq). We highlight new roles for individual TFs and groups of TFs (\\\"TF-TF modules\\\") in Th17 gene regulation. Given the popularity of ATAC-seq, which provides high-resolution with low sample input requirements, we anticipate that application of our methods will improve TRN inference in new mammalian systems, especially in vivo, for cells directly from humans and animal models.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have resulted in a tremendous increase in the amount of omics data produced in plant science. This increase, in conjunction with the heterogeneity and variability of the data, presents a major challenge to adopt an integrative research approach. We are facing an urgent need to effectively integrate and assimilate complementary datasets to understand the biological system as a whole. The Semantic Web offers technologies for the integration of heterogeneous data and their transformation into explicit knowledge thanks to ontologies. We have developed the Agronomic Linked Data (AgroLD - www.agrold.org), a knowledge-based system relying on Semantic Web technologies and exploiting standard domain ontologies, to integrate data about plant species of high interest for the plant science community e.g., rice, wheat, arabidopsis. We present some integration results of the project, which initially focused on genomics, proteomics and phenomics. AgroLD is now an RDF (Resource Description Format) knowledge base of 100M triples created by annotating and integrating more than 50 datasets coming from 10 data sources -such as Gramene.org and TropGeneDB- with 10 ontologies -such as the Gene Ontology and Plant Trait Ontology. Our evaluation results show users appreciate the multiple query modes which support different use cases. AgroLDs objective is to offer a domain specific knowledge platform to solve complex biological and agronomical questions related to the implication of genes/proteins in, for instances, plant disease resistance or high yield traits. We expect the resolution of these questions to facilitate the formulation of new scientific hypotheses to be validated with a knowledge-oriented approach.",

    "abstract": "Natural competence for transformation is a widely used and key mode of horizontal gene transfer that can foster rapid bacterial evolution. Competent bacteria take-up DNA from their environment using Type IV pili, a widespread and multi-purpose class of cell surface polymers. However, how pili facilitate DNA-uptake has remained unclear. Here, using direct labelling, we show that in the Gram-negative pathogen Vibrio cholerae DNA-uptake pili are highly dynamic and that they retract prior to DNA-uptake. Unexpectedly, these pili can self-interact to mediate auto-aggregation of cells into macroscopic structures. This phenotype is conserved in disease causing pandemic strains. However, extensive strain-to-strain variability in the major pilin subunit PilA, present in environmental isolates, controls the ability of pili to interact without affecting transformation. We go on to show that interactions between pili are highly specific, enabling cells producing pili composed of different PilA subunits to discriminate between one another. On chitin surfaces, a natural habitat of V. cholerae, pili connect cells within dense networks, suggesting a model whereby DNA-uptake pili function to promote inter-bacterial interactions during surface colonisation. Moreover, our results provide evidence that type IV pili could provide a simple and potentially widespread mechanism for bacterial kin recognition.",

    "abstract": "Motor adaptations are useful for studying the way in which the lower limbs are controlled by the brain. However, motor adaptation paradigms for the lower limbs are typically based on locomotion tasks, where the necessity of maintaining postural stability is the main driver of adaptation and could possibly mask other underlying processes. In this study we investigated whether small temporal or spatial asymmetries can trigger motor adaptations during stationary cycling, where stability is not directly compromised. Fourteen healthy individuals participated in two experiments: in one of the experiments the angle between the crank arms of the pedals was altered by 10{degrees} to induce a temporal asymmetry; in the other the length of the right pedal was shortened by 2.4 cm to induce a spatial asymmetry. We recorded the acceleration of the crank arms and the EMG signals of 16 muscles (8 per leg). The analysis of the accelerometer data was used to investigate the presence of motor adaptations. Muscle synergy analysis was performed on each side to quantify changes in neuromuscular control. We found that feedforward motor adaptations are present in response to temporal asymmetries and are obtained by progressively shifting the activation patterns of two synergies on the right leg. Spatial asymmetries appear to trigger a feedback-driven response that does not present an aftereffect and is not consistent with a motor adaptation. This response is characterized by a step-like decrease in activity in the right gastrocnemius when the asymmetry is present and likely reflects the altered task demands.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyThe processes driving lower limb motor adaptations are not fully clear, and previous research appears to indicate that adaptations are mainly driven by stability. Here we show that lower limb adaptations can be obtained also in the absence of an explicit balance threat. We also show that adaptations are present also when kinematic error cannot be compensated for, suggesting the presence of intrinsic error measures regulating the timing of activation of the two legs.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are designed to serve as a single summary measure, condensing information from a large number of genetic variants associated with a disease. They have been used for stratification and prediction of disease risk. The construction of a PRS often depends on the purpose of the study, the available data/summary estimates, and the underlying genetic architecture of a disease. In this paper, we consider several choices for constructing a PRS using summary data obtained from various publicly-available sources including the UK Biobank and evaluate their abilities to predict outcomes derived from electronic health records (EHR). Weexamine the three most common skin cancer subtypes in the USA: basal cellcarcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. The genetic risk profiles of subtypes may consist of both shared and unique elements and we construct PRS to understand the common versus distinct etiology. This study is conducted using data from 30,702 unrelated, genotyped patients of recent European descent from the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a longitudinal biorepository effort within Michigan Medicine. Using these PRS for various skin cancer subtypes, we conduct a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) within the MGI data to evaluate their association with secondary traits. PheWAS results are then replicated using population-based UK Biobank data. We develop an accompanying visual catalog called PRSweb that provides detailed PheWAS results and allows users to directly compare different PRS construction methods. The results of this study can provide guidance regarding PRS construction in future PRS-PheWAS studies using EHR data involving disease subtypes.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn the study of genetically complex diseases, polygenic risk scores synthesize information from multiple genetic risk factors to provide insight into a patients risk of developing a disease based on his/her genetic profile. These risk scores can be explored in conjunction with health and disease information available in the electronic medical records. They may be associated with diseases that may be related to or precursors of the underlying disease of interest. Limited work is available guiding risk score construction when the goal is to identify associations across the medical phenome. In this paper, we compare different polygenic risk score construction methods in terms of their relationships with the medical phenome. We further propose methods for using these risk scores to decouple the shared and unique genetic profiles of related diseases and to explore related diseases shared and unique secondary associations. Leveraging and harnessing the rich data resources of the Michigan Genomics Initiative, a biorepository effort at Michigan Medicine, and the larger population-based UK Biobank study, we investigated the performance of genetic risk profiling methods for the three most common types of skin cancer: melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "How proteins localize at the pole remains an enigma. DivIVA/Wag31, which is an essential pole organizing protein in mycobacteria, can assemble at the negatively curved side of the membrane at the growing pole to form a higher order structural scaffold for maintaining cellular morphology and localizing various target proteins for cell-wall biogenesis. A single-site phosphorylation in Wag31 is linked to the regulation of peptidoglycan biosynthesis for optimal mycobacterial growth. The structural organization of polar scaffold formed by coiled-coil rich Wag31, which is a target for anti-tubercular agent amino-pyrimidine sulfonamide, remains to be determined. Here, we report biophysical characterizations of a phospho-mimetic (T73E) and a phospho-ablative (T73A) form of mycobacterial Wag31 using circular dichroism, small angle solution X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy. While data obtained from both variants of Wag31 in solution states suggested formation of alpha-helical, large, elongated particles, their structural organizations were different. Atomic force microscopic images of Wag31 indicate polymer formation, with occasional curving, sharp bending and branching. Observed structural features in this first view of the polymeric forms of Wag31 suggest a basis for higher order network scaffold formation for polar protein localization.",

    "abstract": "Cellular systems have evolved numerous mechanisms to finely control signalling pathway activation and properly respond to changing environmental stimuli. This is underpinned by dynamic spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression. Indeed, in addition to gene transcription and translation regulation, modulation of protein levels, dynamics and localization are also essential checkpoints that govern cell functions. The introduction of tetracycline-inducible promoters has allowed gene expression control using orthogonal small molecules, facilitating rapid and reversible manipulation to study gene function in biological systems. However, differing protein stabilities means this solely transcriptional regulation is insufficient to allow precise ON-OFF dynamics, thus hindering generation of temporal profiles of protein levels seen in vivo. We developed an improved Tet-On based system augmented with conditional destabilising elements at the post-translational level that permits simultaneous control of gene expression and protein stability. Integrating these properties to control expression of a fluorescent protein in mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESCs), we found that adding protein stability control allows faster response times to changes in small molecules, fully tunable and enhanced dynamic range, and vastly improved microfluidic-based in-silico feedback control of gene expression. Finally, we highlight the effectiveness of our dual-input system to finely modulate levels of signalling pathway components in stem cells.",

While most clitellate species reproduce by cross-fertilization, self-fertilization has been described within the speciose genus Helobdella. Here we document the reproductive life histories and reproductive capacities for three other Helobdella species. Under laboratory conditions, both H. robusta and H. octatestisaca exhibit uniparental reproduction, apparently reflecting self-fertility, and suggesting that this trait is ancestral for the genus. However, the third species, H. austinensis, seems incapable of reproduction by self-fertilization, so we inferred its reproductive life history by analyzing reproduction in breeding cohorts. Comparing the reproductive parameters for H. robusta reproducing in isolation and in cohorts revealed that reproduction in cohorts is dramatically delayed with respect to that of isolated individuals, and that cohorts of leeches coordinate their cocoon deposition in a manner that is not predicted from the reproductive parameters of individuals reproducing in isolation. Finally, our comparisons of reproductive capacity for individuals versus cohorts for H. robusta, and between different sizes of cohorts for H. austinensis, reveal differences in resource allocation between male and female reproductive roles that are consistent with evolutionary theory.",

We find that the sexually dimorphic differentiation of postmitotic neurons in the male nervous system is abrogated in animals that carry a mutation in the miRNA let-7 and prematurely executed in animals either lacking the let-7 inhibitor lin-28, or the direct let-7 target lin-41, an RNA-binding, posttranscriptional regulator. We show that an isoform of a phylogenetically conserved transcription factor, lin-29a, is a critical target of LIN-41 in controlling sexual maturation of sex-shared neurons. lin-29a is expressed in a male-specific manner in a subset of sex-shared neurons at the onset of sexual maturation. lin-29a acts cell-autonomously in these neurons to control the expression of sexually dimorphic neurotransmitter switches, sensory receptor expression, neurite anatomy and connectivity, and locomotor behavior. lin-29a is not only required but also sufficient to impose male-specific features at earlier stages of development and in the opposite sex. The temporal, sexual and spatial specificity of lin-29a expression is controlled intersectionally through the lin-28/let-7/lin-41 heterochronic pathway, sex chromosome configuration and neuron type-specific terminal selector transcription factors. Two Doublesex-like transcription factors represent additional neuron-type specific targets of LIN-41 and are regulated in a similar intersectional manner, indicating the existence of modular outputs downstream of the heterochronic pathway. In conclusion, we have provided insights into the molecular logic of the timing of sexual differentiation in the C. elegans nervous system. Remarkably, the lin28/let7 axis also controls the timing of sexual differentiation in mice and humans thereby hinting toward a striking universality of the control mechanisms of sexual differentiation.",

Here we present cryo-EM structures of the substrate-engaged human 26S proteasome in seven conformational states at 2.8-3.6 [A] resolution, captured during polyubiquitylated protein degradation. These structures visualize a continuum of dynamic substrate-proteasome interactions from ubiquitin recognition to processive substrate translocation, during which ATP hydrolysis sequentially navigate through all six ATPase subunits. Three principle modes of coordinated ATP hydrolysis are observed, featuring hydrolytic events in two oppositely positioned ATPases, in two consecutive ATPases, and in one ATPase at a time. They regulate deubiquitylation, translocation initiation and processive unfolding of substrates, respectively. A collective power stroke in the ATPase motor is generated by synchronized ATP binding and ADP release in the substrate-engaging and disengaging ATPases, respectively. It is amplified largely in the substrate-disengaging ATPase, and propagated unidirectionally by coordinated ATP hydrolysis in the third consecutive ATPase.",

    "abstract": "cis-regulatory sequences known as enhancers play a key role in regulating gene expression. Evolutionary changes in these DNA sequences contribute to phenotypic evolution. The Drosophila yellow gene, which is required for pigmentation, has emerged as a model system for understanding how cis-regulatory sequences evolve, providing some of the most detailed insights available into how activities of orthologous enhancers have diverged between species. Here, we examine the evolution of yellow cis-regulatory sequences on a broader scale by comparing the distribution and function of yellow enhancer activities throughout the 5 intergenic and intronic sequences of Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, and Drosophila willistoni. We find that cis-regulatory sequences driving expression in a particular tissue are not as modular as previously described, but rather have many redundant and cryptic enhancer activities distributed throughout the regions surveyed. Interestingly, cryptic enhancer activities of sequences from one species often drove patterns of expression observed in other species, suggesting that the frequent evolutionary changes in yellow expression observed among Drosophila species may be facilitated by gaining and losing repression of pre-existing cis-regulatory sequences.",

    "abstract": "A central goal of sensory neuroscience is to construct models that can explain neural responses to complex, natural stimuli. As a consequence, sensory models are often tested by comparing neural responses to natural stimuli with model responses to those stimuli. One challenge is that distinct model features are often correlated across natural stimuli, and thus model features can predict neural responses even if they do not in fact drive them. Here we propose a simple alternative for testing a sensory model: we synthesize stimuli that yield the same model response as a natural stimulus, and test whether the natural and \\\"model-matched\\\" stimulus elicit the same neural response. We used this approach to test whether a common model of auditory cortex - in which spectrogram-like peripheral input is processed by linear spectrotemporal filters - can explain fMRI responses in humans to natural sounds. Prior studies have that shown that this model has good predictive power throughout auditory cortex, but this finding could reflect stimulus-driven correlations. We observed that fMRI voxel responses to natural and model-matched stimuli were nearly equivalent in primary auditory cortex, but that non-primary regions showed highly divergent responses to the two sound sets, suggesting that neurons in non-primary regions extract higher-order properties not made explicit by traditional models. This dissociation between primary and non-primary regions was not clear from model predictions due to the influence of stimulus-driven response correlations. Our methodology enables stronger tests of sensory models and could be broadly applied in other domains.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryModeling neural responses to natural stimuli is a core goal of sensory neuroscience. Here we propose a new approach for testing sensory models: we synthesize a \\\"model-matched\\\" stimulus that yields the same model response as a natural stimulus, and test whether it produces the same neural response. We used model-matching to test whether a standard model of auditory cortex can explain human cortical responses measured with fMRI. Model-matched stimuli produced nearly equivalent voxel responses in primary auditory cortex, but highly divergent responses in non-primary regions. This dissociation was not evident using more standard approaches for model testing, and suggests that non-primary regions compute higher-order stimulus properties not captured by traditional models. The methodology could be broadly applied in other domains.",

    "abstract": "The large magnitude of protein-protein interaction (PPI) pairs within the human interactome necessitates the development of predictive models and screening tools to better understand this fundamental molecular communication. However, despite enormous efforts from various groups to develop predictive techniques in the last decade, PPI complex structures are in general still very challenging to predict due to the large number of degrees of freedom. In this study, we use the binding complex of human profilin (PFN1) and polyproline-10 (P10) as a model system to examine various approaches, with the aim of going beyond normal protein docking for PPI prediction and evaluation. The potential of mean force (PMF) was first obtained from the timeconsuming umbrella sampling, which confirmed that the most stable binding structure identified by the maximal PMF difference is indeed the crystallographic binding structure. Moreover, crucial residues previously identified in experimental studies, W3, H133 and S137 of PFN1, were found to form favorable hydrogen bonds with P10, suggesting a zipping process during the binding between PFN1 and P10. We then explored both regular molecular dynamics (MD) and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, seeking for better criteria of ranking the PPI prediction. Despite valuable information obtained from conventional MD simulations, neither the commonly used interaction energy between the two binding parties nor the long-term root mean square displacement (RMSD) correlates well with the PMF results. On the other hand, with a sizable collection of trajectories, we demonstrated that the average rupture work calculated from SMD simulations correlates fairly well with the PMFs (R2 = 0.67), making it a promising PPI screening method.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhole genome sequencing (WGS) can elucidate Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transmission patterns but more data is needed to guide its use in high-burden settings. In a household-based transmissibility study of 4,000 TB patients in Lima, Peru, we identified a large MIRU-VNTR Mtb cluster with a range of resistance phenotypes and studied host and bacterial factors contributing to its spread.\\n\\nMethodsWGS was performed on 61 of 148 isolates in the cluster. We compared transmission link inference using epidemiological or genomic data with and without the inclusion of controversial variants, and estimated the dates of emergence of the cluster and antimicrobial drug resistance acquisition events by generating a time-calibrated phylogeny. We validated our findings in genomic data from an outbreak of 325 TB cases in London. Using a larger set of 12,032 public Mtb genomes, we determined bacterial factors characterizing this cluster and under positive selection in other Mtb lineages.\\n\\nFindingsFour isolates were distantly related and the remaining 57 isolates diverged ca. 1968 (95% HPD: 1945-1985). Isoniazid resistance arose once, whereas rifampicin resistance emerged subsequently at least three times. Amplification of other drug resistance occurred as recently as within the last year of sampling. High quality PE/PPE variants and indels added information for transmission inference. We identified five cluster-defining SNPs, including esxV S23L to be potentially contributing to transmissibility.\\n\\nInterpretationClusters defined by MIRU-VNTR typing, could be circulating for decades in a high-burden setting. WGS allows for an improved understanding of transmission, as well as bacterial resistance and fitness factors.\\n\\nFundingThe study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (Peru Epi study U19-AI076217 and K01-ES026835 to MRF).

The implications of its use in high-burden settings are not well understood.\\n\\nAdded value of this studyUsing WGS, we found that TB clusters defined by traditional typing methods may be circulating for several decades. Genomic regions typically excluded from WGS analysis contain large amount of genetic variation that may affect interpretation of transmission events. We also identified five bacterial mutations that may contribute to transmission fitness.\\n\\nImplications of all the available evidenceAdded value of WGS for understanding TB transmission may be even higher in high-burden vs. low-burden settings. Methods integrating variants found in polymorphic sites and insertions and deletions are likely to have higher resolution.

    "abstract": "Identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and cis-regulatory motifs (motifs for short) from genomics datasets, provides a powerful view of the rules governing the interactions between TFs and DNA. Existing motif prediction methods however, are limited by high false positive rates in TFBSs identification, contributions from non-sequence-specific binding, and complex and indirect binding mechanisms. High throughput next-generation sequencing data provides unprecedented opportunities to overcome these difficulties, as it provides multiple whole-genome scale measurements of TF binding information. Uncovering this information brings new computational and modeling challenges in high-dimensional data mining and heterogeneous data integration. To improve TFBS identification and novel motifs prediction accuracy in the human genome, we developed an advanced computational technique based on deep learning (DL) and high-performance computing, named DESSO. DESSO utilizes deep neural network and binomial distribution to optimize the motif prediction. Our results showed that DESSO outperformed existing tools in predicting distinct motifs from the 690 in vivo ENCODE ChIP-Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) datasets for 161 human TFs in 91 cell lines. We also found that protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are prevalent among human TFs, and a total of 61 potential tethering binding were identified among the 100 TFs in the K562 cell line. To further expand DESSOs deep-learning capabilities, we included DNA shape features and found that (i) shape information has a strong predictive power for TF-DNA binding specificity; and (ii) it aided in identification of the shape motifs recognized by human TFs which in turn contributed to the interpretation of TF-DNA binding in the absence of sequence recognition. DESSO and the analyses it enabled will continue to improve our understanding of how gene expression is controlled by TFs and the complexities of DNA binding. The source code and the predicted motifs and TFBSs from the 690 ENCODE TF ChIP-Seq datasets are freely available at the DESSO web server: http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/DESSO.",

Eukaryotes have evolved epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and RNA interference, that silence mobile elements and thereby preserve the integrity of their genomes. We created an artificial reprogrammable epigenetic system based on CRISPR interference to give engineered bacteria a similar line of defense against transposons and other selfish elements in their genomes. We demonstrate that this CRISPR interference against mobile elements (CRISPRi-ME) approach can be used to simultaneously repress two different transposon families in Escherichia coli, thereby increasing the evolutionary stability of costly protein expression. We further show that silencing a transposon in Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 reduces mutation rates by a factor of five, nearly as much as deleting all copies of this element from its genome. By deploying CRISPRi-ME on a broad-host-range vector we have created a generalizable platform for stabilizing the genomes of engineered bacterial cells for applications in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.\\n\\nSignificanceEngineered cells often cease to function or lose productivity when mutations arise in their genomes. Mobile DNA elements, such as transposons, are major sources of these inactivating mutations. Eukaryotic genomes have evolved flexible epigenetic defenses against mobile DNA that help them to maintain genome integrity, but bacteria do not possess comparable silencing systems. We developed a synthetic control system based on CRISPR interference that can be used to give bacterial cells a reprogrammable line of defense against selfish DNA elements in their genomes. We show that this system effectively represses multicopy transposons and multiple families of transposons. Limiting selfish DNA proliferation within a genome in this way improves the reliability of genetically engineered functions in replicating bacterial cell populations.",

    "abstract": "Natural genetic variation can determine the outcome of an infection, and often reflects the co-evolutionary battle between hosts and pathogens. We previously found that a natural variant of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans from Hawaii (HW) has increased resistance against natural microsporidian pathogens in the Nematocida genus, when compared to the standard laboratory strain of N2. In particular, HW animals can clear infection, while N2 animals cannot. In addition, HW animals have lower levels of intracellular colonization of Nematocida compared to N2. Here we investigate how this natural variation in resistance relates to autophagy. We found that there is much better targeting of autophagy-related machinery to parasites under conditions where they are cleared. In particular, ubiquitin targeting to Nematocida cells correlates very well with their subsequent clearance in terms of timing, host strain and age, as well as Nematocida species. Furthermore, clearance correlates with targeting of the LGG-2/LC3 autophagy protein to parasite cells, with HW animals having much more efficient targeting of LGG-2 to parasite cells than N2 animals. Surprisingly, however, we found that lgg-2 is not required to clear infection. Instead we found that loss of lgg-2 leads to increased intracellular colonization in the HW background, although interestingly, it does not affect colonization in the N2 background.

    "abstract": "Eusocial insects owe their ecological success to the division of labour and processes within colonies often rely on the presence of specific microbial symbionts, but associations between microbial community compositions and castes with different tasks and diets within colonies remain largely unexplored. Fungus-growing termites evolved to use fungi to externally degrade plant material, complemented by specific and complex gut microbiotas. Here we explore to which extent division of labour and dietary differences within fungus-growing termite castes are linked to gut bacterial community structure. Using amplicon sequencing, we characterise community compositions in sterile (worker and soldier) and reproductive (queen and king) termites and combine this with gut enzyme, microscopy, and in situ analyses to further elucidate sterile caste-specific microbiota compositions. Gut bacterial communities are structured primarily according to termite caste and genus. In contrast to the observed rich and diverse sterile caste microbiotas, royal pair microbiotas are extremely skewed and dominated by few bacterial taxa, reflecting the specialised dietary intake and unique, reproduction-centred lifestyle of the queen and king.",

    "abstract": "Pairs of nucleotides within biologically functional nucleic acid secondary structures often exhibit evidence of coevolution that is consistent with the maintenance of canonical base-pairing. MESSI is a sequence evolution model that infers substitution rates associated with base-paired sites in alignments of DNA or RNA sequences. MESSI can estimate these whilst simultaneously accounting for the uncertainty associated with an unknown RNA or DNA secondary structure shared across an alignment of sequences. Moreover, the unknown structure can be predicted, or a base-pairing probability matrix calculated. MESSI optionally leverages CUDA GPU parallelism to accelerate inference. MESSI was used to infer coevolution rates associated with GC, AU (AT in DNA), GU (GT in DNA) pairs in non-coding RNA alignments, and single-stranded RNA and DNA virus alignments. Inferred rates of GU pair coevolution were found to be higher at base-paired sites in single-stranded RNA viruses and non-coding RNAs than those of GT pairs in single-stranded DNA viruses, suggesting that GT pairs do not stabilise DNA secondary structures to the same extent as GU pairs in RNA. The relative coevolution rates associated with GC, AU, and GU pairs were largely consistent with their relative chemical base-pairing stabilities (GC base-pairs being more stable than AU base-pairs, and AU base-pairs being more stable than GU base-pairs). Additionally, MESSI estimates the degrees of coevolution at individual base-paired sites in an alignment. These estimates were computed for a SHAPE-MaP-determined HIV-1 NL4-3 RNA secondary structure and two corresponding alignments. MESSIs estimates of coevolution were significantly more strongly correlated with experimentally-determined SHAPE-MaP pairing scores as compared to three non-evolutionary measures of base-pairing covariation. Finally, to assist researchers in prioritising substructures with potential biological functionality, MESSI automatically identifies substructures and ranks them by degrees of coevolution at base-paired sites within them. Such a ranking was created for an HIV-1 subtype B alignment, revealing an excess of top-ranking substructures that have been previously identified in the literature as having structure-related functional importance, and a number of top-ranking structures that have not yet been characterised.",

Considerable phenotypic variation is exhibited during infection, including increased capsule size, capsule shedding, giant cells ([&ge;] 15 m) and micro cells ([&le;] 1 m). We examined 70 clinical isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus tetragattii from HIV/AIDS patients in Botswana to determine if the capacity to produce morphological variants was associated with clinical parameters. Isolates were cultured under conditions designed to simulate in vivo stresses. Substantial variation was seen across morphological and clinical data. Giant cells were more common in C. tetragattii, while micro cells and shed capsule occurred in C. neoformans only. Phenotypic variables fell into two groups associated with differing symptoms. The production of \\\"large\\\" phenotypes (greater cell and capsule size and giant cells) was associated with higher CD4 count and was negatively correlated with intracranial pressure indicators, suggesting these are induced in early-stage infection. \\\"Small\\\" phenotypes (micro cells and shed capsule) were associated with lower CD4 counts, negatively correlated with meningeal inflammation indicators and positively correlated with intracranial pressure indicators, suggesting they are produced later during infection and may contribute to immune suppression and promote proliferation and dissemination. These trends persisted at the species level, indicating that they were not driven by association with particular Cryptococcus species. Isolates possessing giant cells, micro cells, and shed capsule were rare, but strikingly were associated with patient death (p=0.0165).

    "abstract": "Most studies investigating human gut microbiome dynamics are conducted in modern populations. However, unindustrialized populations are arguably better subjects in answering human-gut microbiome coevolution questions due to their lower exposure to antibiotics and higher dependence on natural resources. Hadza hunter-gatherers in Tanzania have been found to exhibit high biodiversity and seasonal patterns in their gut microbiome composition at family level, where some taxa disappear in one season and reappear at later time. However, such seasonal changes have previously been profiled only according to species abundances, with genome-level variant dynamics unexplored. As a result it is still elusive how microbial communities change at the genome-level under environmental pressures caused by seasonal changes. Here, a strain-level SNP analysis of Hadza gut metagenome is performed for 40 Hadza fecal samples collected in three seasons. First, we benchmarked three SNP calling tools based on simulated sequencing reads, and selected VarScan2 that has highest accuracy and sensitivity after a filtering step. Second, we applied VarScan2 on Hadza gut microbiome, with results showing that: with more SNP presented in wet season in general, eight prevalent species have significant SNP enrichments in wet season of which only three species have relatively high abundances. This indicates that SNP characteristics are independent of species abundances, and provides us a unique lens towards microbial community dynamics. Finally, we identify 83 genes with the most characteristic SNP distributions between wet season and dry season. Many of these genes are from Ruminococcus obeum, and mainly from metabolic pathways like carbon metabolism, pyruvate metabolism and glycolysis, as shown by KEGG annotation. This implies that the seasonal changes might indirectly impact the mutational patterns for specific species and functions for gut microbiome of an unindustrialized population, indicating the role of these variants in their adaptation to the changing environment and diets.\\n\\nImportanceBy analyzing the changes of SNP enrichments in different seasons, we have found that SNP characteristics are independent of species abundances, and could provide us a unique lens towards microbial community dynamics at the genomic level.

Visualizing and analysing the rich data offers an opportunity to learn more about the effects of mutations, for a better understanding and engineering of proteins. This work focuses on such visualization analyses applied to the mutational data of TEM-1 {beta}-lactamase. The data is examined in the light of the expected biochemical effects of single point mutations, with the goal of reinforcing or retraining the intuitions. Individual attributes of the amino acid mutations such as the solvent accessible area, charge type change, and distance from the catalytic center capture most of the relevant functional effects.

    "abstract": "The Zetaproteobacteria are a class of bacteria typically associated with marine Fe oxidizing environments. First discovered in the hydrothermal vents at Loihi Seamount, Hawaii, they have become model organisms for marine microbial Fe oxidation. In addition to deep sea and shallow hydrothermal vents, Zetaproteobacteria are found in coastal sediments, other marine subsurface environments, steel corrosion biofilms, as well as saline terrestrial aquifers and springs. Isolates from a range of environments all grow by Fe oxidation. Their success lies partly in their microaerophily, which enables them to compete with abiotic Fe oxidation at the low O2 concentrations common to Fe(II)-rich oxic/anoxic transition zones. Also, Zetaproteobacteria make a variety of biomineral morphologies as a repository for Fe(III) waste, and as attachment structures. To determine the known diversity of the Zetaproteobacteria, we have used 16S rRNA gene sequences to define 59 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), at 97% similarity. While some Zetaproteobacteria taxa appear to be cosmopolitan, various habitats enrich for different sets of Zetaproteobacteria. OTU networks show that certain Zetaproteobacteria co-exist, sharing compatible niches. These niches may correspond with adaptations to O2, H2, and nitrate availability, based on genomic analyses. Also, a putative Fe oxidation gene has been found in diverse Zetaproteobacteria taxa, suggesting that the Zetaproteobacteria evolved as specialists in Fe oxidation. In all, culture, genomic, and environmental studies suggest that Zetaproteobacteria are widespread, and therefore have a broad influence on marine and saline terrestrial Fe cycling.",

    "abstract": "Temperate phages constitute a potentially beneficial genetic reservoir for bacterial innovation despite being selfish entities encoding an infection cycle inherently at odds with bacterial fitness. These phages integrate their genomes into the bacterial host during infection, donating new, but deleterious, genetic material: the phage genome encodes toxic genes, such as lysins, that kill the bacterium during the phage infection cycle. Remarkably, some bacteria have exploited the destructive properties of phage genes for their own benefit by co-opting them as toxins for functions related to bacterial warfare, virulence, and secretion. However, do toxic phage genes ever become raw material for functional innovation? Here we report on a toxic phage gene whose product has lost its toxicity and has become a domain of a core cellular factor, SpmX, throughout the bacterial order Caulobacterales. Using a combination of phylogenetics, bioinformatics, structural biology, cell biology, and biochemistry, we have investigated the origin and function of SpmX and determined that its occurrence is the result of the detoxification of a phage peptidoglycan hydrolase gene. We show that the retained, attenuated activity of the phage-derived domain plays an important role in proper cell morphology and developmental regulation in representatives of this large bacterial clade. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of phage gene domestication in which a toxic phage gene has been co-opted for a housekeeping function.",

    "abstract": "Humans and other animals are able to discover underlying statistical structure in their environments and exploit it to achieve efficient and effective performance. However, such structure is often difficult to learn and use because it is obscure, involving long-range temporal dependencies. Here, we analysed behavioural data from an extended experiment with rats, showing that the subjects learned the underlying statistical structure, albeit suffering at times from immediate inferential imperfections as to their current state within it. We accounted for their behaviour using a Hidden Markov Model, in which recent observations are integrated with the recollections of an imperfect memory. We found that over the course of training, subjects came to track their progress through the task more accurately, a change that our model largely attributed to decreased forgetting. This  learning to remember decreased reliance on recent observations, which may be misleading, in favour of a longer-term memory.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHumans and other animals possess the remarkable ability to find and exploit patterns and structures in their experience of a complex and varied world. However, such structures are often temporally extended and latent or hidden, being only partially correlated with immediate observations of the world. This makes it essential to integrate current and historical information, and creates a challenging statistical and computational problem.\\n\\nHere, we examine the behaviour of rats facing a version of this challenge posed by a brain-stimulation reward task. We find that subjects learned the general structure of the task, but struggled when immediate observations were misleading. We captured this behaviour with a model in which subjects integrated evidence from their observations together with a memory whose imperfections accounted for their errors.\\n\\nThe subjects performance improved markedly over successive sessions, allowing them to overcome misleading observations. According to the model, this arose from a process of  learning to remember in which subjects became better at employing more reliable past observations to determine the hidden state of the world.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal neurons fire selectively in local behavioral contexts such as the position in an environment or phase of a task,1-3 and are thought to form a cognitive map of task-relevant variables.1,4,5 However, their activity varies over repeated behavioral conditions,6 such as different runs through the same position or repeated trials. Although widely observed across the brain,7-10 such variability is not well understood, and could reflect noise or structure, such as the encoding of additional cognitive information.6,11-13 Here, we introduce a conceptual model to explain variability in terms of underlying, population-level structure in single-trial neural activity. To test this model, we developed a novel unsupervised learning algorithm incorporating temporal dynamics, in order to characterize population activity as a trajectory on a nonlinear manifold--a space of possible network states. The manifolds structure captures correlations between neurons and temporal relationships between states, constraints arising from underlying network architecture and inputs. Using measurements of activity over time but no information about exogenous behavioral variables, we recovered hippocampal activity manifolds during spatial and non-spatial cognitive tasks in rats. Manifolds were low-dimensional and smoothly encoded task-related variables, but contained an extra dimension reflecting information beyond the measured behavioral variables. Consistent with our model, neurons fired as a function of overall network state, and fluctuations in their activity across trials corresponded to variation in the underlying trajectory on the manifold. In particular, the extra dimension allowed the system to take different trajectories despite repeated behavioral conditions. Furthermore, the trajectory could temporarily decouple from current behavioral conditions and traverse neighboring manifold points corresponding to past, future, or nearby behavioral states. Our results suggest that trial-to-trial variability in the hippocampus is structured, and may reflect the operation of internal cognitive processes. The manifold structure of population activity is well-suited for organizing information to support memory,1,5,14 planning,12,15,16 and reinforcement learning.17,18 In general, our approach could find broader use in probing the organization and computational role of circuit dynamics in other brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Although a standard reinforcement learning model can capture many aspects of reward-seeking behaviors, it may not be practical for modeling human natural behaviors because of the richness of dynamic environments and limitations in cognitive resources. We propose a modular reinforcement learning model that addresses these factors. Based on this model, a modular inverse reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to estimate both the rewards and discount factors from human behavioral data, which allows predictions of human navigation behaviors in virtual reality with high accuracy across different subjects and with different tasks. Complex human navigation trajectories in novel environments can be reproduced by an artificial agent that is based on the modular model. This model provides a strategy for estimating the subjective value of actions and how they influence sensory-motor decisions in natural behavior.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIt is generally agreed that human actions can be formalized within the framework of statistical decision theory, which specifies a cost function for actions choices, and that the intrinsic value of actions is controlled by the brains dopaminergic reward machinery. Given behavioral data, the underlying subjective reward value for an action can be estimated through a machine learning technique called inverse reinforcement learning. Hence it is an attractive method for studying human reward-seeking behaviors. Standard reinforcement learning methods were developed for artificial intelligence agents, and incur too much computation to be a viable model for real-time human decision making. We propose an approach called modular reinforcement learning that decomposes a complex task into independent decision modules. This model includes a frequently overlooked variable called the discount factor, which controls the degree of impulsiveness in seeking future reward. We develop an algorithm called modular inverse reinforcement learning that estimates both the reward and the discount factor. We show that modular reinforcement learning may be a useful model for natural navigation behaviors. The estimated rewards and discount factors explain human walking direction decisions in a virtual-reality environment, and can be used to train an artificial agent that can accurately reproduce human navigation trajectories.",
