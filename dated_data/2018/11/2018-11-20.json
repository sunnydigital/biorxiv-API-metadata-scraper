    "abstract": "Convergent evolution describes the process of different populations acquiring similar phenotypes or genotypes. Complex organisms with large genomes only rarely and only under very strong selection converge to the same genotype. In contrast, independent virus populations with very small genomes often acquire identical mutations. Here we test the hypothesis of whether convergence in early HIV-1 infection is common enough to serve as an indicator for selection. To this end, we measure the number of convergent mutations in a well-studied dataset of full-length HIV-1 env genes sampled from HIV-1 infected individuals during early infection. We compare this data to a neutral model and find an excess of convergent mutations. Convergent mutations are not evenly distributed across the env gene, but more likely to occur in gp41, which suggests that convergent mutations provide a selective advantage and hence are positively selected. In contrast, mutations that are only found in an HIV-1 population of a single individual are significantly affected by purifying selection. Our analysis suggests that comparisons between convergent and private mutations with neutral models allow us to identify positive and negative selection in small viral genomes. Our results also show that selection significantly shapes HIV-1 populations even before the onset of the adaptive immune system.",

    "abstract": "Parasitism is a life strategy that has repeatedly evolved within the Florideophyceae. Historically, the terms adelphoparasite and alloparasite have been used to distinguish parasites based on the relative phylogenetic relationship of host and parasite. However, analyses using molecular phylogenetics indicate that nearly all red algal parasites infect within their taxonomic family, and a range of relationships exist between host and parasite. To date, all investigated adelphoparasites have lost their plastid, and instead, incorporate a host derived plastid when packaging spores. In contrast, a highly reduced plastid lacking photosynthesis genes was sequenced from the alloparasite Choreocolax polysiphoniae. Here we present the complete Harveyella mirabilis plastid genome, which has also lost genes involved in photosynthesis, and a partial plastid genome from Leachiella pacifica. The H. mirabilis plastid shares more synteny with free-living red algal plastids than that of C. polysiphoniae. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that C. polysiphoniae, H. mirabilis, and L. pacifica form a robustly supported clade of parasites, which retain their own plastid genomes, within the Rhodomelaceae. We therefore transfer all three genera from the exclusively parasitic family, Choreocolacaceae, to the Rhodomelaceae. Additionally, we recommend applying the terms archaeplastic parasites (formerly alloparasites), and neoplastic parasites (formerly adelphoparasites) to distinguish red algal parasites using a biological framework rather than taxonomic affiliation with their hosts.",

However, cell experiments are frequently performed on homogenously coated substrates with only one integrin ligand present. Here, we employed binary-choice substrates of Fn and Vn to dissect V{beta}3 integrin-mediated binding to both ligands on the subcellular scale. Superresolution imaging revealed that V{beta}3 integrin preferred binding to Vn under various conditions. In contrast, binding to Fn required mechanical load on V{beta}3 integrin. Integrin mutations, structural analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations established a model where the extended-closed conformation of V{beta}3 integrin binds Vn but not Fn. Force-mediated hybrid domain swing-out characterizes the extended-open conformation needed for efficient Fn binding. Thus, force-dependent conformational changes in V{beta}3 integrin increase the number of available ligands and therefore the ligand promiscuity of this integrin. These findings for V{beta}3 integrin were shown to regulate cell migration and mechanotransduction differentially on Fn compared to Vn and therefore to regulate cell behavior.",

    "abstract": "O_LIBipartite networks are widely-used to represent a diverse range of species interactions, such as pollination, herbivory, parasitism and seed dispersal. The structure of these networks is usually characterised by calculating one or more metrics that capture different aspects of network architecture. While these metrics capture useful properties of networks, they only consider structure at the scale of the whole network (the macro-scale) or individual species (the micro-scale).  Meso-scale structure between these scales is usually ignored, despite representing ecologically-important interactions. Network motifs are a framework for capturing this meso-scale structure and are gaining in popularity. However, there is no software available in R, the most popular programming language among ecologists, for conducting motif analyses in bipartite networks. Similarly, no mathematical formalisation of bipartite motifs has been developed.\\nC_LIO_LIHere we introduce bmotif: a package for counting motifs, and species positions within motifs, in bipartite networks. Our code is primarily an R package, but we also provide MATLAB and Python code of the core functionality. The software is based on a mathematical framework where, for the first time, we derive formal expressions for motif frequencies and the frequencies with which species occur in different positions within motifs. This framework means that analyses with bmotif are fast, making motif methods compatible with the permutational approaches often used in network studies, such as null model analyses.\\nC_LIO_LIWe describe the package and demonstrate how it can be used to conduct ecological analyses, using two examples of plant-pollinator networks. We first use motifs to examine the assembly and disassembly of an Arctic plant-pollinator community, and then use them to compare the roles of native and introduced plant species in an unrestored site in Mauritius.\\nC_LIO_LIbmotif will enable motif analyses of a wide range of bipartite ecological networks, allowing future research to characterise these complex networks without discarding important meso-scale structural detail.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Identifying gene expression programs underlying both cell-type identity and cellular activities (e.g. life-cycle processes, responses to environmental cues) is crucial for understanding the organization of cells and tissues. Although single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) can quantify transcripts in individual cells, each cells expression profile may be a mixture of both types of programs, making them difficult to disentangle. Here we illustrate and enhance the use of matrix factorization as a solution to this problem. We show with simulations that a method that we call consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF) accurately infers identity and activity programs, including the relative contribution of programs in each cell. Applied to published brain organoid and visual cortex scRNA-Seq datasets, cNMF refines the hierarchy of cell types and identifies both expected (e.g. cell cycle and hypoxia) and intriguing novel activity programs. We propose that one of the novel programs may reflect a neurosecretory phenotype and a second may underlie the formation of neuronal synapses. We make cNMF available to the community and illustrate how this approach can provide key insights into gene expression variation within and between cell types.",

    "abstract": "Heteromorphic sex chromosomes have evolved repeatedly among vertebrate lineages despite largely deleterious reductions in gene dose. Understanding how this gene dose problem is overcome is hampered by the lack of genomic information at the base of tetrapods and comparisons across the evolutionary history of vertebrates. To address this problem, we produced a chromosome-level genome assembly for the African Bullfrog (Pyxicephalus adspersus)--an amphibian with heteromorphic ZW sex chromosomes--and discovered that the Bullfrog Z is surprisingly homologous to substantial portions of the human X. Using this new reference genome, we identified ancestral synteny among the sex chromosomes of major vertebrate lineages, showing that non-mammalian sex chromosomes are strongly associated with a single vertebrate ancestral chromosome, while mammals are associated with another that displays increased haploinsufficiency. The sex chromosomes of the African Bullfrog however, share genomic blocks with both humans and non-mammalian vertebrates, connecting the two ancestral chromosome sequences that repeatedly characterize vertebrate sex chromosomes. Our results highlight the consistency of sex-linked sequences despite sex determination system lability and reveal the repeated use of two major genomic sequence blocks during vertebrate sex chromosome evolution.",

    "abstract": "In animals that communicate for pair formation, generally one sex invests more effort in mate searching. Although searching by males is prevalent in most animals, in orthopteran insects and some other taxa females physically move to localise signalling males who are predominantly sedentary. Although the two sexes thus share mate searching effort in orthopterans, their behavioural strategies are different and sexual selection theory predicts that signalling males may be following the riskier strategy and incurring higher costs. However, relative levels of risk posed by the two mate searching strategies remain largely unexplored. Hence, we estimated the relative predation risk experienced in natural populations by signalling males and responding females. We did this by quantifying predation risk as a probability of mortality in the context of acoustic communication in a tree cricket, Oecanthus henryi from its ecologically relevant predator, a lynx spider, Peucetia viridans. Spiders may perceive calling in males and movement in females by their ability to detect both airborne acoustic cues and substrate-borne vibratory cues. Probability of mortality was quantified by partitioning it into three spatial components at which crickets and spiders interact, using a combination of extensive field observations and manipulative experiments in a semi-natural setup. We found no differences in predation risk faced by calling males and responding females, suggesting that direct benefits offered by males to females upon pair formation may better explain shared mate searching effort between the sexes in orthopterans.",

    "abstract": "Successful prediction of the likely paths of tumor progression is valuable for diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment purposes. Cancer progression models (CPMs) use cross-sectional samples to identify restrictions in the order of accumulation of driver mutations and thus CPMs encode the paths of tumor progression. Here we analyze the performance of four CPMs to examine whether they can be used to predict the true distribution of paths of tumor progression and to estimate evolutionary unpredictability. Employing simulations we show that if fitness landscapes are single peaked (have a single fitness maximum) there is good agreement between true and predicted distributions of paths of tumor progression when sample sizes are large, but performance is poor with the currently common much smaller sample sizes. Under multi-peaked fitness landscapes (i.e., those with multiple fitness maxima), performance is poor and improves only slightly with sample size. In all cases, detection regime (when tumors are sampled) is a key determinant of performance. Estimates of evolutionary unpredictability from the best performing CPM, among the four examined, tend to overestimate the true un-predictability and the bias is affected by detection regime; CPMs could be useful for estimating upper bounds to the true evolutionary unpredictability. Analysis of twenty-two cancer data sets shows low evolutionary unpredictability for several of the data sets. But most of the predictions of paths of tumor progression are very unreliable, and unreliability increases with the number of features analyzed. Our results indicate that CPMs could be valuable tools for predicting cancer progression but that, currently, obtaining useful predictions of paths of tumor progression from CPMs is dubious, and emphasize the need for methodological work that can account for the probably multi-peaked fitness landscapes in cancer.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryKnowing the likely paths of tumor progression is instrumental for cancer precision medicine as it would allow us to identify genetic targets that block disease progression and to improve therapeutic decisions. Direct information about paths of tumor progression is scarce, but cancer progression models (CPMs), which use as input cross-sectional data on genetic alterations, can be used to predict these paths. CPMs, however, make assumptions about fitness landscapes (genotype-fitness maps) that might not be met in cancer. We examine if four CPMs can be used to predict successfully the distribution of tumor progression paths; we find that some CPMs work well when sample sizes are large and fitness landscapes have a single fitness maximum, but in fitness landscapes with multiple fitness maxima prediction is poor. However, the best performing CPM in our study could be used to estimate evolutionary unpredictability. When we apply the best performing CPM in our study to twenty-two cancer data sets we find that predictions are generally unreliable but that some cancer data sets show low unpredictability. Our results highlight that CPMs could be valuable tools for predicting disease progression, but emphasize the need for methodological work to account for multi-peaked fitness landscapes.",

CD, NMR and hydrogen/deuterium exchange measurements as well as MD simulations showed that the mutations distinctly altered the intrinsic structural and dynamical properties of the TMD. However, although helix destabilization/unfolding was not observed at the initial {varepsilon}-cleavage sites of C99, both mutants impaired {gamma}-secretase cleavage and altered its cleavage specificity. Moreover, helix flexibility enabled by the di-glycine hinge translated to motions of other helix parts.

Whether and how nucleosome variants encode unique mechanical properties to their cognate chromatin structures remains elusive. Here, using novel in silico and in vitro nanoindentation methods, extending to in vivo dissections, we report that histone variant nucleosomes are intrinsically more elastic than their canonical counterparts. Furthermore, binding proteins which discriminate between histone variant nucleosomes suppress this innate elasticity and also compact chromatin. Interestingly, when we overexpress the binding proteins in vivo, we also observe increased compaction of chromatin enriched for histone variant nucleosomes, correlating with diminished access. Together, these data suggest a plausible link between innate mechanical properties possessed by histone variant nucleosomes, the adaptability of chromatin states in vivo, and the epigenetic plasticity of the underlying locus.\\n\\nSignificanceNucleosomes are the base unit which organize eukaryotic genomes. Besides the canonical histone, histone variants create unique local chromatin domains that fine-tune transcription, replication, DNA damage repair, and faithful chromosome segregation. We developed computational and single-molecule nanoindentation tools to determine mechanical properties of histone variant nucleosomes. We found that the CENP-A nucleosome variant is more elastic than the canonical H3 nucleosome but becomes stiffer when bound to its partner CENP-C. In addition, CENP-C induces cross-array clustering, creating a chromatin state that less accessible.

Here, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically design features for fluorescence microscopy. We use a self-supervised method to learn feature representations of single cells in microscopy images without labelled training data. We train CNNs on a simple task that leverages the inherent structure of microscopy images and controls for variation in cell morphology and imaging: given one cell from an image, the CNN is asked to predict the fluorescence pattern in a second different cell from the same image. We show that our method learns high-quality features that describe protein expression patterns in single cells both yeast and human microscopy datasets. Moreover, we demonstrate that our features are useful for exploratory biological analysis, by capturing high-resolution cellular components in a proteome-wide cluster analysis of human proteins, and by quantifying multi-localized proteins and single-cell variability. We believe paired cell inpainting is a generalizable method to obtain feature representations of single cells in multichannel microscopy images.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTo understand the cell biology captured by microscopy images, researchers use features, or measurements of relevant properties of cells, such as the shape or size of cells, or the intensity of fluorescent markers. Features are the starting point of most image analysis pipelines, so their quality in representing cells is fundamental to the success of an analysis. Classically, researchers have relied on features manually defined by imaging experts. In contrast, deep learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) automatically learn features, which can outperform manually-defined features at image analysis tasks. However, most CNN methods require large manually-annotated training datasets to learn useful features, limiting their practical application. Here, we developed a new CNN method that learns high-quality features for single cells in microscopy images, without the need for any labeled training data. We show that our features surpass other comparable features in identifying protein localization from images, and that our method can generalize to diverse datasets. By exploiting our method, researchers will be able to automatically obtain high-quality features customized to their own image datasets, facilitating many downstream analyses, as we highlight by demonstrating many possible use cases of our features in this study.",

    "abstract": "A study pertinent to the numerical modeling of cortical neurostimulation is conducted in an effort to compare the performance of the finite element method (FEM) and an original formulation of the boundary element fast multipole method (BEM-FMM) at matched computational performance metrics. We consider two problems: (i) a canonic multi-sphere geometry and an external magnetic-dipole excitation where the analytical solution is available and; (ii) a problem with realistic head models excited by a realistic coil geometry. In the first case, the FEM algorithm tested is a fast open-source getDP solver running within the SimNIBS 2.1.1 environment. In the second case, a high-end commercial FEM software package ANSYS Maxwell 3D is used. The BEM-FMM method runs in the MATLAB(R) 2018a environment.\\n\\nIn the first case, we observe that the BEM-FMM algorithm gives a smaller solution error for all mesh resolutions and runs significantly faster for high-resolution meshes when the number of triangular facets exceeds approximately 0.25 M. We present other relevant simulation results such as volumetric mesh generation times for the FEM, time necessary to compute the potential integrals for the BEM-FMM, and solution performance metrics for different hardware/operating system combinations. In the second case, we observe an excellent agreement for electric field distribution across different cranium compartments and, at the same time, a speed improvement of three orders of magnitude when the BEM-FMM algorithm used.\\n\\nThis study may provide a justification for anticipated use of the BEM-FMM algorithm for high-resolution realistic transcranial magnetic stimulation scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Trio family and case-control studies of next-generation sequencing data have proven integral to understanding the contribution of rare inherited and de novo single-nucleotide variants to the genetic architecture of complex disease. Ideally, such studies should identify individual risk genes of moderate to large effect size to generate novel treatment hypotheses for further follow-up. However, due to insufficient power, gene set enrichment analyses have come to be relied upon for detecting differences between cases and controls, implicating sets of hundreds of genes rather than specific targets for further investigation. Here, we present a Bayesian statistical framework, termed gTADA, that integrates gene-set membership information with gene-level de novo and rare inherited case-control counts, to prioritize risk genes with excess rare variant burden within enriched gene sets. Applying gTADA to available whole-exome sequencing datasets for several neuropsychiatric conditions, we replicated previously reported gene set enrichments and identified novel risk genes. For epilepsy, gTADA prioritized 40 risk genes (posterior probabilities > 0.95), 6 of which replicate in an independent whole-genome sequencing study. In addition, 30/40 genes are novel genes. We found that epilepsy genes had high protein-protein interaction (PPI) network connectivity, and show specific expression during human brain development. Some of the top prioritized EPI genes were connected to a PPI subnetwork of immune genes and show specific expression in prenatal microglia. We also identified multiple enriched drug-target gene sets for EPI which included immunostimulants as well as known antiepileptics. Immune biology was supported specifically by case-control variants from familial epilepsies rather than do novo mutations in generalized encephalitic epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Even with effective viral control, HIV-infected individuals are at a higher risk for morbidities associated with older age than the general population, and these serious non-AIDS events (SNAEs) track with plasma inflammatory and coagulation markers. The cell subsets driving inflammation in aviremic HIV infection are not yet elucidated. Also, whether ART-suppressed HIV infection causes premature induction of the inflammatory events found in uninfected elderly or if a novel inflammatory network ensues when HIV and older age co-exist is unclear. In this study we measured combinational expression of five inhibitory receptors (IRs) on seven immune cell subsets and 16 plasma markers from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma samples, respectively, from a HIV and Aging cohort comprised of ART-suppressed HIV-infected and uninfected controls stratified by age ([&le;]35 or [&ge;]50 years old). For data analysis, multiple multivariate computational algorithms (cluster identification, characterization, and regression (CITRUS), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)) were used to determine if immune parameter disparities can distinguish the subject groups and to investigate if there is a cross-impact of aviremic HIV and age on immune signatures. IR expression on gamma delta ({gamma}{delta}) T cells exclusively separated HIV+ subjects from controls in CITRUS analyses and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic mediators from {gamma}{delta} T cells tracked with TIGIT expression among HIV+ subjects. Also, plasma markers predicted the percentages of TIGIT+ {gamma}{delta} T cells in subjects with and without HIV in PSLR models, and a PLS-DA model of {gamma}{delta} T cell IR signatures and plasma markers significantly stratified all four of the subject groups (uninfected younger, uninfected older, HIV+ younger, and HIV+ older). These data implicate {gamma}{delta} T cells as an inflammatory driver in ART-suppressed HIV infection and provide evidence of distinct  inflamm-aging processes with and without ART-suppressed HIV infection.",

Furthermore, we uncover that these proteins restrict and moderate the expression of spinal isoforms of Pou2f2, a transcription factor known to regulate B-cell differentiation.

However, sparse serotype-specific counts in epidemiologic datasets may undermine such analyses, most notably for rare serotypes that pose emergence risks in vaccinated populations. This challenge is well-illustrated in Group B streptococcus (GBS), where serotype III dominates in both carriage and disease.\\n\\nMethodsWe develop an empirical Bayes random-effects model based on conjugate Dirichlet-multinomial distributions of serotype frequencies in carriage and disease states. We validate the model using simulated datasets, and apply it to data from 15 paired sets of GBS isolates from intrapartum rectovaginal colonization (n=3403) and neonatal invasive disease (NID; n=1088), 16 from blood (n=2352) and cerebrospinal fluid (n=780) neonatal specimens, and 3 from fatal (n=173) and non-fatal (n=1684) neonatal invasive infections.\\n\\nResultsOur method accurately recovers parameters in simulated datasets. Using this approach, we confirm that GBS serotype III exhibits the greatest invasiveness, followed by serotype Ia with a 75.3% (95%CrI: 43.7-93.8%) lower estimate. Enhanced invasiveness of serotypes III and Ia is most evident in late-onset disease. Non-hexavalent-vaccine serotypes, which are rare in carriage and disease, generally show lower invasiveness; serotype IX/non-typeable GBS, the most prevalent cause of non-vaccine-preventable disease, is 98.7% (81.7-99.9%) and 94.2% (13.9-99.6%) less invasive than serotypes III and Ia, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionsWe present a strategy for measuring associations of serotype with carrier and disease states in the presence of sparse counts, avoiding biases that exist in common ad-hoc approaches.",

However the underlying mechanisms and functional consequences are poorly defined. Here, we identify extensive transcriptome-3end-alterations in neuroblastoma, a tumour entity with a paucity of recurrent somatic mutations and an unusually high frequency of spontaneous regression. Utilising extensive RNAi-screening we reveal the landscape and drivers of transcriptome-3end-diversification, discovering PCF11 as critical regulator, directing alternative polyadenylation (APA) of hundreds of transcripts including a differentiation RNA-operon. PCF11 shapes inputs converging on WNT-signalling, and governs cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis and neurodifferentiation. Postnatal PCF11 down-regulation induces a neurodifferentiation program, and low-level PCF11 in neuroblastoma associates with favourable outcome and spontaneous tumour regression.

In this study, we have defined a role for a conserved gene of unknown function in B. abortus envelope stress resistance and infection. Expression of this gene, which we name eipA, is directly activated by the essential cell cycle regulator, CtrA. eipA encodes a soluble periplasmic protein that adopts an unusual eight-stranded {beta}-barrel fold. Deletion of eipA attenuates replication and survival in macrophage and mouse infection models, and results in sensitivity to treatments that compromise the integrity of the cell envelope. Transposon disruption of genes required for LPS O-polysaccharide biosynthesis is synthetically lethal with eipA deletion. This genetic connection between O-polysaccharide and eipA is corroborated by our discovery that eipA is essential in Brucella ovis, a naturally rough species that harbors mutations in several genes required for O-polysaccharide production. Conditional depletion of eipA expression in B. ovis results in a cell chaining phenotype, providing evidence that eipA directly or indirectly influences cell division in Brucella. We conclude that EipA is a molecular determinant of Brucella virulence that functions to maintain cell envelope integrity and influences cell division.",

We identify a substantial shared core of genes upregulated in the abdomens of queen ants and honey bees that also tends to be upregulated in mated female flies, suggesting that these genes are part of a conserved insect reproductive groundplan. Outside of this shared groundplan, few genes are differentially expressed in common. Instead, the majority of the thousands of caste-associated genes are plastically-expressed, rapidly evolving, and relatively evolutionarily young.

    "abstract": "To understand the neural mechanisms underlying brain function, neuroscientists aim to quantify causal interactions between neurons, for instance by perturbing the activity of neuron A and measuring the effect on neuron B. Recently, manipulating neuron activity using light-sensitive opsins, optogenetics, has increased the specificity of neural perturbation. However, using widefield optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which neurons produced the causal effect. Here, we show how such confounds produce large biases in interpretations. We explain how confounding can be reduced by combining instrumental variables (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. Combined, these methods can estimate (causal) effective connectivity by exploiting the weak, approximately random signal resulting from the interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron. In simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful to disentangle neural interactions in the brain.",

A recent model of emotional memory, the emotional Context Maintenance and Retrieval model (eCMR), predicts that these effects would be stronger when stimuli that predict high and low reward can compete with each other both during encoding and retrieval. We tested this prediction in two experiments. Participants were promised {pound}1 for remembering some pictures, but only a few pence for remembering others. Their recall of the content of the pictures they saw was tested after one minute and in Experiment 2, also after 24 hours. Memory at immediate test showed effects of list composition. Recall of stimuli that predicted high reward was greater than of stimuli that predicted lower reward, but only when high- and low-reward items were studied and recalled together, not when they were studied and recalled separately. More high-reward items in mixed lists were forgotten over a 24-hour retention interval compared to items studied in other conditions, but reward did not modulate the forgetting rate, a null effect which should be replicated in a larger sample. These results confirm eCMRs predictions, although further research is required to compare that model against alternatives.",

    "abstract": "Auditory neurons encode stimulus history, which is often modelled using a span of time-delays in a spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF). We propose an alternative model for the encoding of stimulus history, which we apply to extracellular recordings of neurons in the primary auditory cortex of anaesthetized ferrets. For a linear-non-linear STRF model (LN model) to achieve a high level of performance in predicting single unit neural responses to natural sounds in the primary auditory cortex, we found that it is necessary to include time delays going back at least 200 ms in the past. This is an unrealistic time span for biological delay lines. We therefore asked how much of this dependence on stimulus history can instead be explained by dynamical aspects of neurons. We constructed a neural-network model whose output is the weighted sum of units whose responses are determined by a dynamic firing-rate equation. The dynamic aspect performs low-pass filtering on each units response, providing an exponentially decaying memory whose time constant is individual to each unit. We find that this dynamic network (DNet) model, when fitted to the neural data using STRFs of only 25 ms duration, can achieve prediction performance on a held-out dataset comparable to the best performing LN model with STRFs of 200 ms duration. These findings suggest that integration due to the membrane time constants or other exponentially-decaying memory processes may underlie linear temporal receptive fields of neurons beyond 25 ms.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe responses of neurons in the primary auditory cortex depend on the recent history of sounds over seconds or less. Typically, this dependence on the past has been modelled by applying a wide span of time delays to the input, although this is likely to be biologically unrealistic. Real neurons integrate the history of their activity due to the dynamical properties of their cell membranes and other components. We show that a network with a realistically narrow span of delays and with units having dynamic characteristics like those found in neurons, succinctly models neural responses recorded from ferret primary auditory cortex. Because these integrative properties are widespread, our dynamic network provides a basis for modelling responses in other neural systems.",

    "abstract": "The earliest human graphic productions dating to the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic are associated with anatomically modern and archaic hominins. These productions, which consist of abstract patterns engraved on a variety of media, may have been used as symbols, and their emergence is thought to be associated with the evolution of the properties of the visual cortex. To test this hypothesis, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activations triggered by the perception of engraved patterns dating between 540,000 and 30,000 years before the present with those elicited by the perception of scenes, objects, symbol-like characters, and written words. The perception of the engravings bilaterally activated regions in the ventral route in a pattern similar to that produced by the perception of objects, suggesting that these graphic productions are processed as organized visual representations in the brain. Moreover, the perception of the engravings led to a leftward activation of the visual word form area. These results support the hypothesis that in contrast to random doodles, the earliest abstract graphic productions had a representational purpose for modern and archaic hominins.",

    "abstract": "The EGFR-adaptor protein CIN85 has been shown to promote breast cancer malignancy and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stability. However, the mechanisms underlying cancer promotion remain ill-defined. Here, we show that CIN85 is a novel binding partner of the main HIF-prolyl hydroxylase PHD2, but not of PHD1 or PHD3. Mechanistically, the N-terminal SH3 domains of CIN85 interact with the proline-arginine rich region within the N-terminus of PHD2, thereby inhibiting PHD2 activity and HIF-degradation. This activity is essential in vivo, as specific loss of the CIN85-PHD2 interaction in CRISPR/Cas9 edited cells affected growth and migration properties as well as tumor growth in mice. Overall, we discovered a previously unrecognized tumor growth checkpoint that is regulated by CIN85-PHD2, and uncovered an essential survival function in tumor cells linking growth factor adaptors with hypoxia signaling.",

Syndromic OFC in which patients present with additional developmental deficits are identified to have a strong genetic component. We applied exome gene panel sequencing in a cohort of 14 Colombian patients identified at Operation Smile in Bogota, Colombia, with syndromic orofacial clefting phenotypes and additional features initially suggesting Aarskog-Scott syndrome (AAS). Gene panel sequencing failed to identify any causal variants in the FGD1 gene which underlies this condition, but variants in a number of genes suggest alternative clinical diagnoses across five patients (~ 36%). The novel variants identified here maps to developmentally important genes including SRCAP, OFD1, NIPBL, GRIN2A and KMT2D6. Our result demonstrates the extensive heterogeneity underlying OFC and emphasises the need for systematic phenotyping of patients with rare conditions. Gene panel sequencing has the potential to cost-effectively resolve ambiguous clinical diagnoses, but rigorous attention should be paid to gene coverage as our results suggest highly variable read depths across individual gene exons and this may reduce the quality of variant calls at specific locations.",

    "abstract": "1 AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSEpigenome-wide association studies using DNA methylation have the potential to uncover novel biomarkers and mechanisms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, the direction of causation for these associations is not always clear, and investigations to-date have generally failed to replicate at the level of individual loci. Here, we undertook module- and region-based DNA methylation analyses of incident CVD in the Womens Health Initiative (WHI) and Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (FHS) in order to find more robust epigenetic biomarkers for cardiovascular risk.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe applied weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and the Comb-p algorithm to find methylation modules and regions associated with incident CVD in the WHI dataset. We discovered two modules whose activation correlated with CVD risk and replicated across cohorts. One of these modules was enriched for development-related processes and overlaps strongly with epigenetic aging sites. For the other, we showed preliminary evidence for monocyte-specific effects and statistical links to cumulative exposure to traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Additionally, we found three regions (associated with the genes SLC9A1, SLC1A5, and TNRC6C) whose methylation associates with CVD risk.\\n\\nConclusionsIn sum, we present several epigenetic associations with incident CVD that reveal disease mechanisms related to development and monocyte biology. Furthermore, we show that epigenetic modules may act as a molecular readout of cumulative cardiovascular risk factor exposure, with implications for the improvement of clinical risk prediction.",

    "abstract": "Fusion transcripts are used as biomarkers in companion diagnoses. Although more than 15,000 fusion RNAs have been identified from diverse cancer types, few common feature has been reported. Here, we compared 16,410 fusion transcripts detected in cancer (from a published cohort of 9,966 tumor samples of 33 cancer types) with genome-wide RNA-DNA interactions mapped in two normal, non-cancerous cell types (using iMARGI, an enhanced version of the MARGI [Mapping RNA-Genome Interactions assay]). Among the top 10 most significant RNA-DNA interactions in normal cells, 5 co-localized with the gene pairs that formed fusion RNAs in cancer. Furthermore, throughout the genome, the frequency of a gene pair to exhibit RNA-DNA interactions is positively correlated with the probability of this gene pair to present documented fusion transcripts in cancer. To test whether RNA-DNA interactions in normal cells are predictive of fusion RNAs, we analyzed in a validation cohort of 96 lung cancer samples using RNA-seq. We found 34 out of 42 fusion transcripts in the validation cohort exhibited RNA-DNA interactions in normal cells. Finally, combining RNA-seq, single-molecule RNA FISH, and DNA FISH, we detected a cancer sample with Eml4-Alk fusion RNA without forming the Eml4-Alk fusion gene. Collectively, these data suggest a novel RNA-poise model, where spatial proximity of RNA and DNA could poise for creation of fusion transcripts.",

    "abstract": "Behavior arises from neuronal activity, but it is not known how the active neurons are distributed across brain regions and how their activity unfolds in time. Here, we used high-density Neuropixels probes to record from ~30,000 neurons in mice performing a visual contrast discrimination task. The task activated 60% of the neurons, involving nearly all 42 recorded brain regions, well beyond the regions activated by passive visual stimulation. However, neurons selective for choice (left vs. right) were rare, and found mostly in midbrain, striatum, and frontal cortex. Those in midbrain were typically activated prior to contralateral choices and suppressed prior to ipsilateral choices, consistent with a competitive midbrain circuit for adjudicating the subject's choice. A brain-wide state shift distinguished trials in which visual stimuli led to movement. These results reveal concurrent representations of movement and choice in neurons widely distributed across the brain.",

    "abstract": "The underlying physical causes of SOD1-related ALS are still not well-understood. We address this problem here by computationally designing two de novo mutants, A89R and K128N, which were predicted theoretically to be either significantly destabilizing or stabilizing respectively. We subjected these in silico designed mutants to a series of experimental tests, including in vitro measures of thermodynamic stability, cell-based aggregation and toxicity assays, and an in vivo developmental model of zebrafish motor neuron axonopathy. The experimental tests validated the theoretical predictions: A89R is an unstable, highly-deleterious mutant, and K128N is a stable, non-toxic mutant. Moreover, K128N is predicted computationally to form an unusually stable heterodimer with the familial ALS mutant A4V. Consistent with this prediction, co-injection of K128N and A4V into zebrafish shows profound rescue of motor neuron pathology. The demonstrated success of these first principles calculations to predict the physical properties of SOD1 mutants holds promise for rationally designed therapies to counter the progression of ALS.\\n\\nSignificanceMutations in the protein superoxide dismutase cause ALS, and many of these mutants have decreased folding stability. We sought to pursue this thread using a synthetic biology approach, where we designed two de novo mutations, one stabilizing and one destabilizing, as predicted using computational molecular dynamics simulations. We then tested these mutants using in vitro, cell-based, and in vivo zebrafish models. We found that the unstable mutant was toxic, and induced a severe ALS phenotype in zebrafish; the predicted stable mutant, on the other hand, behaved even better than WT. In fact, it was able to rescue the ALS phenotype caused by mutant SOD1. We propose a mechanism for this rescue, which may provide an avenue for therapeutic intervention.",

Here, we construct cell-type-specific TF binding annotations by intersecting sequence-based TF binding predictions with cell-type-specific chromatin data; this strategy addresses both the limitation that identical sequences may be bound or unbound depending on surrounding chromatin context, and the limitation that sequence-based predictions are generally not cell-type-specific. We evaluated different combinations of sequence-based TF predictions and chromatin data by partitioning the heritability of 49 diseases and complex traits (average N=320K) using stratified LD score regression with the baseline-LD model (which is not cell-type-specific). We determined that 100bp windows around MotifMap sequenced-based TF binding predictions intersected with a union of six cell-type-specific chromatin marks (imputed using ChromImpute) performed best, with an 58% increase in heritability enrichment compared to the chromatin marks alone (11.6x vs 7.3x; P = 9 x 10-14 for difference) and a 12% increase in cell-type-specific signal conditional on annotations from the baseline-LD model (P = 8 x 10-11 for difference).

    "abstract": "Cellular Zn2+ homeostasis is tightly regulated and primarily mediated by designated Zn2+ transport proteins, namely ZnTs (SLC30) that shuttle Zn2+ efflux, and ZIPs (SLC39) that mediate Zn2+ influx. While the functional determinants of ZnT-mediated Zn2+ efflux are elucidated, those of ZIP transporters are lesser understood. Previous work has suggested three distinct molecular mechanisms: (I) HCO3- or (II) H+ coupled Zn2+ transport, or (III) a pH regulated electrodiffusional mode of transport. Here, using live-cell fluorescent imaging of Zn2+ and H+, in cells expressing ZIP4, we set out to interrogate its function. Intracellular pH changes or the presence of HCO3- failed to induce Zn2+ influx. In contrast, extracellular acidification stimulated ZIP4 dependent Zn2+ uptake. Furthermore, Zn2+ uptake was coupled to enhanced H+ influx in cells expressing ZIP4, thus indicating that ZIP4 is not acting as a pH regulated channel but rather as an H+ powered Zn2+ co-transporter. We further illustrate how this functional mechanism is affected by genetic variants in SLC39A4 that in turn lead to Acrodermatitis Enteropathica, a rare condition of Zn2+ deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Human genetic variants are usually represented by four values with variable length: chromosome, position, reference and alternate alleles. Thereis no guarantee that these components are represented in a consistent way across different data sources, and processing variant-based data can be inefficient because four different comparison operations are needed for each variant, three of which are string comparisons. Working with strings, in contrast to numbers, poses extra challenges on computer memory allocation and data-representation. Existing variant identifiers do not typicallyrepresent every possible variant we may be interested in, nor they are directly reversible. To overcome these limitations, VariantKey, a novel reversible numerical encoding schema for human genetic variants, is presented here alongside a multi-language open-source software implementation (http://github.com/genomicspls/variantkey). VariantKey represents variants as single 64 bit numeric entities, while preserving the ability to be searched and sorted by chromosome and position. The individual components of short variants can be directly read back from the VariantKey, while long variants are supported with a fast lookup table.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LI~100 compounds identified by high-content screen inhibit SGs in HEK293, NPCs and iPS-MNs.\\nC_LIO_LIALS-associated RBPs are recruited to SGs in an RNA-dependent manner\\nC_LIO_LIMolecules with planar moieties prevent recruitment of ALS-associated RBPs to SGs\\nC_LIO_LICompounds inhibit TDP-43 accumulation in SGs and in TARDBP mutant iPS-MNs.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling pathways have well established roles in skeletal development, with essential functions in both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. In mice, previous conditional knockout studies suggested distinct roles for FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling at different stages of osteogenesis and a role for FGFR2 in osteoblast maturation. However, the potential for redundancy among FGFRs and the mechanisms and consequences of stage-specific osteoblast lineage regulation were not addressed. Here, we conditionally inactivate Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 in mature osteoblasts with an Osteocalcin-Cre or Dentin matrix protein 1-CreER driver. We find that young mice lacking both receptors or only FGFR1 are phenotypically normal. However, after 6 weeks of age these Fgfr1/Fgfr2 double- and Fgfr1 single-conditional knockout mice develop a high bone mass phenotype with increased periosteal apposition, increased endocortical woven bone with increased porosity, and biomechanical properties that reflect increased bone mass but impaired material properties. Histopathological and gene expression analyses show that this phenotype is preceded by a striking loss of osteocytes, and gradual activation of the Wnt/{beta}Catenin signaling pathway. These data identify a role for FGFR1 signaling in mature osteoblasts/osteocytes that is required for osteocyte survival during postnatal bone growth.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomic analysis holds immense potential for identifying rare and uncharacterized microorganisms from many ecological habitats. Actinobacteria have been proved to be an excellent source of novel antibiotics for several decades. The present study was designed to delineate and understand the bacterial diversity with special focus on Actinobacteria from pond sediment collected from Sanjeeviraya Hanuman Temple, Ayyangarkulam, Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu, India. The sediment had an average temperature (25.32%), pH (7.13), salinity (0.960 mmhos/cm) and high organic content (10.7%) posing minimal stress on growth condition of the microbial community. Subsequent molecular manipulations, sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of V3 and V4 region of 16S rRNA metagenomics analysis confirmed the presence of 40 phyla, 100 classes, 223 orders, 319 families and 308 genera in the sediment sample dominated by Acidobacteria (18.14%), Proteobacteria (15.13%), Chloroflexi (12.34), Actinobacteria (10.84%), Cyanobacteria (5.58%), Verrucomicrobia (3.37%), Firmicutes (2.28%), and, Gemmatimonadetes (1.63%). Among the Actinobacteria phylum, Acidothermus (29.68%) was the predominant genus followed by Actinospica (17.65%), Streptomyces (14.64%), Nocardia (4.55%) and Sinomonas (2.9%). Culture-dependent isolation of Actinobacteria yielded all strains of similar morphology to that of Streptomyces genus which clearly indicating that the traditional based technique is incapable of isolating majority of the non-Streptomyces or the so called rare Actinobacteria. Although Actinobacteria were among the dominant phylum, a close look at the species level indicated that only 15.2% within the Actinobacterial phylum could be assigned to cultured species. This leaves a vast majority of the Actinobacterial species yet to be explored with possible novel metabolites have special pharmaceutical and industrial application. It also indicates that the microbial ecology of pond sediment is neglected fields which need attention.",

They play crucial role in cell signaling, regulatory functions and responsible for several diseases. Although, they are abundant in nature, only a small fraction of it has been characterized till date. Such proteins adopt a range of conformations and can undergo transformation from disordered-to-ordered state or vice-versa upon binding to ligand. Insights of such conformational transition is perplexing in several cases. In the present study, we characterized disordered as well as ordered states and the factors contributing the transitions through a mutational study by employing replica exchange molecular dynamics simulation on a {beta}{gamma}-crystallin. Most of the proteins within this superfamily are inherently ordered. However, Hahellin, although a member of {beta}{gamma}-crystallin, it is intrinsically disordered in its apo-form which takes a well-ordered {beta}{gamma}-crystallin fold upon binding to Ca2+. It is intriguing that the mutation at the 5th position of the canonical motif to Arg increases the domain stability in several ordered microbial {beta}{gamma}-crystallins with concomitant loss in Ca2+ binding affinity. We carried out similar Ser to Arg mutations at 5th position of the canonical motif for the first time in an intrinsically disordered protein to understand the mechanistic insights of conformational transition. Our study revealed that newly formed ionic and hydrogen bonding interactions at the canonical Ca2+ binding sites play crucial role in transforming the disordered conformation into ordered {beta}{gamma}-crystallin.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIntrinsically disordered proteins lack a unique ordered 3D structure under physiological condition. Although, they are abundant in nature, only a small fraction of these proteins has been characterized till date due to adaptation of multiple conformations and methodological limitation. {beta}{gamma}-crystallins are inherently ordered, however recently a small number of proteins within this superfamily have been identified as intrinsically disordered protein. Hahellin is one such protein which is intrinsically disordered in its apo-form but takes a well-ordered {beta}{gamma}-crystallin fold upon binding to Ca2+. In the present study, we decipher the underlying mechanism of disordered-to-ordered transition in Hahellin by mutations, employing replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. Earlier experimental studies reported an increase in stabilization of the ordered {beta}{gamma}-crystallion upon mutation to Arg at 5th position of the canonical Ca2+ binding motifs, N/D-N/D-X1-X2-S/T-S. We performed similar Ser to Arg mutation in an intrinsically disordered Hahellin to get the mechanistic insights of the conformational transition in the absence of Ca2+. Our study revealed that several newly formed ionic and hydrogen bonding interactions contributed by the mutant residues are responsible for both intra- and inter-motif rigidification, resulting in overall stability of {beta}{gamma}-crystallin domain.",

Additionally, it was shown that CSC are resistant to chemo- and radio-therapies which suggests that these cells can be responsible for tumor relapses after these treatments. Experimental data in cancer cell lines have shown the intriguing phenomena of CSC population stability, which means that isolated CSC population rapidly stabilizes at its characteristic level (the relative proportion of CSC in a whole cancer population).

Mosquito control programmes and other interventions have not stopped the alarming trend of increasingly large epidemics in the past few years.\\n\\nHere, we analyzed monthly dengue cases reported in Brazil between 2001 and 2016 to better characterize the key drivers of dengue epidemics. Spatio-temporal analysis revealed recurring travelling waves of disease occurrence. Using wavelet methods, we characterised the average seasonal pattern of dengue in Brazil, which starts in the western states of Acre and Rondonia, then travels eastward to the coast before reaching the northeast of the country. Only two states in the north of Brazil (Roraima and Amapa) did not follow the countrywide pattern and had inconsistent timing of dengue epidemics throughout the study period.\\n\\nWe also explored epidemic synchrony and timing of annual dengue cycles in Brazilian regions. Using gravity style models combined with climate factors, we showed that both human mobility and vector ecology contribute to spatial patterns of dengue occurrence.\\n\\nThis study offers a characterization of the spatial dynamics of dengue in Brazil and its drivers, which could inform intervention strategies against dengue and other arboviruses.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn this paper we studied the synchronization of dengue epidemics in Brazilian regions. We found that a typical dengue season in Brazil can be described as a wave travelling from the western part of the country towards the east, with the exception of the two most northern equatorial states that experienced inconsistent seasonality of dengue epidemics.\\n\\nWe found that the spatial structure of dengue cases is driven by both climate and human mobility patterns. In particular, precipitation was the most important factor for the seasonality of dengue at finer spatial resolutions.\\n\\nOur findings increase our understanding of large scale dengue patterns and could be used to enhance national control programs against dengue and other arboviruses.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks are complex non-linear systems, capable of ongoing activity in the absence of driving inputs. The dynamical properties of these systems, in particular their long-time attractor states, are determined on the microscopic level by the connection strengths wij between the individual neurons. However, little is known to which extent network dynamics is tunable on a more coarse-grained level by the statistical features of the weight matrix. In this work, we investigate the dynamical impact of three statistical parameters: density (the fraction of non-zero connections), balance (the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory connections), and symmetry (the fraction of neuron pairs with wij = wji). By computing a  phase diagram of network dynamics, we find that balance is the essential control parameter: Its gradual increase from negative to positive values drives the system from oscillatory behavior into a chaotic regime, and eventually into stationary fix points. Only directly at the border of the chaotic regime do the neural networks display rich but regular dynamics, thus enabling actual information processing. These results suggest that the brain, too, is fine-tuned to the  edge of chaos by assuring a proper balance between excitatory and inhibitory neural connections.\\n\\nAuthor summaryComputations in the brain need to be both reproducible and sensitive to changing input from the environment. It has been shown that recurrent neural networks can meet these simultaneous requirements only in a particular dynamical regime, called the edge of chaos in non-linear systems theory. Here, we demonstrate that recurrent neural networks can be easily tuned to this critical regime of optimal information processing by assuring a proper ratio of excitatory and inhibitory connections between the neurons. This result is in line with several micro-anatomical studies of the cortex, which frequently confirm that the excitatory-inhibitory balance is strictly conserved in the cortex. Furthermore, it turns out that neural dynamics is largely independent from the total density of connections, a feature that explains how the brain remains functional during periods of growth or decay. Finally, we find that the existence of too many symmetric connections is detrimental for the above mentioned critical dynamical regime, but maybe in turn useful for pattern completion tasks.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscription factors (TFs) bind to specific DNA sequences, TF motifs, in cis-regulatory sequences and control the expression of the diverse transcriptional programs encoded in the genome. The concerted action of TFs within the chromatin context enables precise temporal and spatial expression patterns. To understand how TFs control gene expression it is essential to model TF binding. TF motif information can help to interpret the exact role of individual regulatory elements, for instance to predict the functional impact of non-coding variants.\\n\\nFindingsHere we present GimmeMotifs, a comprehensive computational framework for TF motif analysis. Compared to the previously published version, this release adds a whole range of new functionality and analysis methods. It now includes tools for de novo motif discovery, motif scanning and sequence analysis, motif clustering, calculation of performance metrics and visualization. Included with GimmeMotifs is a non-redundant database of clustered motifs. Compared to other motif databases, this collection of motifs shows competitive performance in discriminating bound from unbound sequences. Using our de novo motif discovery pipeline we find large differences in performance between de novo motif finders on ChIP-seq data. Using an ensemble method such as implemented in GimmeMotifs will generally result in improved motif identification compared to a single motif finder. Finally, we demonstrate maelstrom, a new ensemble method that enables comparative analysis of TF motifs between multiple high-throughput sequencing experiments, such as ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq. Using a collection of ~200 H3K27ac ChIP-seq data sets we identify TFs that play a role in hematopoietic differentiation and lineage commitment.\\n\\nConclusionGimmeMotifs is a fully-featured and flexible framework for TF motif analysis.

    "abstract": "The long-term preservation of DNA requires a number of optimal conditions, including consistent exposure to cool, dry, and dark environments. As a result, the successful recovery of ancient DNA from material from warmer climates such as those in Egypt has often been met with scepticism. Egypt has an abundance of ancient mummified animals and humans, whose genetic analyses would offer important insights into ancient cultural practices. To date, the retrieval of complete genomes from ancient Egyptian remains of humans or other animals has been largely unsuccessful. To test for the presence of even short DNA sequences in Egyptian material, we performed second-generation shotgun sequencing of DNA libraries constructed from ancient Sacred Ibis mummies. Since most of the resulting Illumina libraries were shown to contain extremely low levels (less than 0.06%) of endogenous mitochondrial DNA, we aimed to enrich these samples using targeted in-solution hybridisation methods. Using biotinylated RNA baits designed to Sacred Ibis complete mitochondrial sequences, we trialled a number of conditions and parameters and achieved up to 4705-fold enrichment. We also found that a combination of hybridisation temperature and the use of the polymerase KAPA HiFi significantly increased both the efficiency of targeted hybridisation and post-hybridisation amplification respectively. Furthermore, improved enrichment was accompanied with only minor increases in clonality. Our method enabled us to reconstruct the first complete mitochondrial genomes from ancient Egyptian sub-fossil material.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are present in at least 30% of the eukaryotic proteome and are enriched in chromatin-associated proteins. Using a combination of genetics, biochemistry, and single-molecule biophysics, we characterize how IDRs regulate the functions of the yeast MutL (Mlh1-Pms1) mismatch repair (MMR) complex. Shortening or scrambling the IDRs in both subunits ablates MMR in vivo. Mlh1-Pms1 complexes with shorter IDRs that disrupt MMR retain wild-type DNA binding affinity but are impaired for diffusion on both naked and nucleosome-coated DNA. Moreover, the IDRs also regulate the ATP hydrolysis and nuclease activities that are encoded in the structured N- and C-terminal domains of the complex. This combination of phenotypes underlies the catastrophic MMR defect seen with the mutant MutL in vivo. More broadly, this work highlights an unanticipated multi-functional role for IDRs in regulating both facilitated diffusion on chromatin and nucleolytic processing of a DNA substrate.",

    "abstract": "The ability to detect specific nucleic acid sequences allows for a wide range of applications including identification of pathogens, clinical diagnostics, and genotyping. CRISPR-Cas proteins Cas12a and Cas13a are RNA-guided endonucleases that bind and cleave specific DNA and RNA sequences, respectively. After recognition of a target sequence both enzymes activate a unique, indiscriminate nucleic acid cleavage activity, which has been exploited for detection of sequence specific nucleotides using labelled reporter molecules. We here present a label-free detection approach that uses a readout based on solution turbidity caused by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Turbidity arises from coacervates of positively charged polyelectrolytes with long poly(dT) or poly(U) oligonucleotides. In the presence of a target sequence, long oligonucleotides are progressively shortened, changing the solution from turbid to transparent. We explain how oligonucleotide cleavage resolves LLPS by using a mathematical model which we validate with poly(dT) phase separation experiments. The deployment of LLPS complements CRISPR-based molecular diagnostic applications and facilitates easy and low-cost nucleotide sequence detection.",

We have identified a relatively rare proline to leucine mutation (P152L) in p53 in an Indian oral cancer patient sample at the fade end of its DNA binding domain (DBD). Although P152Lp53 DBD potentially binds to DNA, the full length protein is completely devoid of DNA binding ability at its cognate site. Interestingly, P152Lp53 can efficiently tetramerize. Significantly, this mutant when expressed in p53 null cell line, was found to induce cell mobility, proliferation, and invasion as compared to vector control. Also, enhanced tumorigenic potential was observed when cells expressing P152Lp53 were xenografted into nude mice, the mechanistic details of which were also investigated upon where several of the pathways were found to be upregulated such as Cell-Cell/Cell-ECM signalling, EGFR signalling, Rho-GTPase signalling. Taken together, this study establishes P152Lp53 as a new gain of function mutant.",

An online platform is used to design two long gene-specific oligonucleotides for PCR with generic template cassettes to create linear dsDNA donors, termed PCR cassettes. PCR cassettes encode the tag (e.g. GFP), a Cas12a CRISPR RNA for cleavage of the target locus and short homology arms for directed integration via homologous recombination. The integrated tag is coupled to a generic terminator shielding the tagged gene from the co-inserted auxiliary sequences. Co-transfection of PCR cassettes with a Cas12a-encoding plasmid leads to robust endogenous expression of tagged genes, with tagging efficiency of up to 20% without selection, and up to 60% when selection markers are used. We used target-enrichment sequencing to investigate all potential sources of artefacts. Our work outlines a quick strategy particularly suitable for exploratory studies using endogenous expression of fluorescent protein tagged genes",

In particular, mutations in genes that are required for basic cellular functions and/or reproduction often interfere with the generation of homozygous mutant plants, precluding further functional studies. To overcome this limitation, we devised a CRISPR-based tissue-specific knockout system, CRISPR-TSKO, enabling the generation of somatic mutations in particular plant cell types, tissues, and organs. In Arabidopsis, CRISPR-TSKO mutations in essential genes caused well-defined, localized phenotypes in the root cap, stomatal lineage, or entire lateral roots. The underlying modular cloning system allows for efficient selection, identification, and functional analysis of mutant lines directly in the first transgenic generation. The efficacy of CRISPR-TSKO opens new avenues to discover and analyze gene functions in spatial and temporal contexts of plant life while avoiding pleiotropic effects of system-wide loss of gene function.",

    "abstract": "Reproductive success is often highly skewed in animal populations. Yet the processes leading to this are not always clear. Similarly, connections in animal social networks are often non-randomly distributed, with some individuals with many connections and others with few, yet whether there are simple explanations for this pattern has not been determined. Numerous social interactions involve dyads embedded within a wider network. As a result, it may be possible to model which individuals accumulate social interaction through a more general understanding of the social networks structure, and how this structure changes over time. We analysed fighting and mating interactions across the breeding season in a population of wild field crickets under surveillance from a network of video cameras. We fitted stochastic actor-oriented models to determine the dynamic process by which networks of cricket fighting and mating interactions form, and how they co-influence each other. We found crickets tended to fight those in close spatial proximity to them, and those possessing a mutual connection in the fighting network, and heavier crickets fought more often. We also found that crickets who mate with many others tended to fight less in the following time period. This demonstrates that a mixture of spatial constraints, characteristics of individuals and characteristics of the immediate social environment are key for determining social interactions. The mating interaction network required very few parameters to understand its growth and so structure; only homophily by mating success was required to simulate the skew of mating interactions seen in this population. This demonstrates that relatively simple, but dynamic processes can give highly skewed distributions of mating success.",

    "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemias (AML) are characterized by mutations of tumor suppressor and oncogenes, involving distinct genes in adults and children. While certain mutations have been associated with the increased risk of AML relapse, the genomic landscape of primary chemotherapy resistant AML is not well defined. As part of the TARGET initiative, we performed whole-genome DNA and transcriptome (RNA and miRNA) sequencing analysis of pediatric AML with failure of induction chemotherapy. We identified at least three genetic groups of patients with induction failure, including those with NUP98 rearrangements, somatic mutations of WT1 in the absence of NUP98 mutations, and additional recurrent variants including those in KMT2C and MLLT10. Comparison of specimens before and after chemotherapy revealed distinct and invariant gene expression programs. While exhibiting overt therapy resistance, these leukemias nonetheless showed diverse forms of clonal evolution upon chemotherapy exposure. This included selection for mutant alleles of FRMD8, DHX32, PIK3R1, SHANK3, MKLN1, as well as persistence of WT1 and TP53 mutant clones, and elimination or contraction of FLT3, PTPN11, and NRAS mutant clones. These findings delineate genetic mechanisms of primary chemotherapy resistance in pediatric AML, which should inform improved approaches for its diagnosis and therapy.",

We use a landscape genomics approach at sites sampled throughout the range of this system in Kenya to investigate the demographics and genetic structure of the different partners in the association. We find that different species of ant associates of V. drepanolobium show striking differences in their spatial distribution throughout Kenya, and these differences are only partly correlated with abiotic factors. A comparison of the population structure of the host plant and its three obligately arboreal ant symbionts, Crematogaster mimosae, Crematogaster nigriceps, and Tetraponera penzigi, shows that the ants exhibit somewhat similar patterns of structure throughout each of their respective ranges, but that this does not correlate in any clear way with the respective genetic structure of the populations of their host plants. A lack of evidence for local coadaptation in this system suggests that all partners have evolved to cope with a wide variety of biotic and abiotic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium protozoan parasites undergo rounds of asexual replication inside human erythrocytes, progressing from ring stage, to trophozoites and schizonts, before egress and reinvasion. Given the discovery of ring-specific artemisinin tolerance and quiescence in Plasmodium falciparum, there is great urgency to better understand ring stage biology. However, the lack of an effective enrichment method has left rings and related parasite stages understudied compared to their late stage counterparts, which can be easily isolated due to their paramagnetic properties. Here, a method for separating all Plasmodium infected erythrocytes from uninfected erythrocytes is presented. This approach takes advantage of streptolysin-O (SLO) to preferentially lyse uninfected erythrocytes as previously shown by Jackson, et al. Following lytic treatment, Percoll gradient centrifugation removes lysed cells, leaving an intact cell population enriched in infected erythrocytes. This SLO-Percoll (SLOPE) method is effective on stages from the entire erythrocytic cycle, including previously inaccessible forms such as circulating rings from malaria-infected patients and artemisinin-induced quiescent parasites. Furthermore, the utility of SLOPE is extended to multiple media formulations used for the propagation of two human Plasmodium species. The alteration of external cholesterol levels modulates SLOPE effectiveness, demonstrating the role of erythrocyte membrane cholesterol in lytic discrimination. Importantly, enrichment does not impact parasite viability, which establishes the non-toxic nature of SLOPE. Targeted metabolomics of SLOPE-enriched ring stage samples confirms the impact on treated samples; parasite-derived metabolites are increased and contaminating host material is reduced compared to non-enriched samples.\\n\\nImportanceMalaria is caused by infection with protozoan Plasmodium parasites and is responsible for over 400,000 deaths annually. The availability of effective antimalarial drugs is critical to the reduction of malaria-related mortality, yet widespread resistance highlights the need for the continued study of Plasmodium biology. The SLOPE method is an accessible, scalable, rapid (30-40min), and non-toxic enrichment method that is broadly effective on many erythrocytic stages. This method is ideal for use upstream of a variety of sensitive analyses, which will increase experimental quality in virtually all areas of asexual Plasmodium parasite research. Further, because the consumption of cholesterol is a common characteristic of other intracellular parasites (both bacteria and other protozoa), SLOPE holds potential for extension to other relevant pathogens.",

We observed anatomically intermixed spiking sequences, comprised of  odor-cells encoding olfactory cues, followed by  time-cells encoding odor-specific delay time-points. Odor-cells were reliably activated across trials and retained stable fields over days and different delays. In contrast, time-cells exhibited sparse, unreliable activation and labile fields that remapped over days and extended delays. Moreover, the number of odor-cells remained stable, whereas time-cells increased over days during learning of the task, but not during passive exposure. Therefore, multi-modal representations with distinct learning-related dynamics and stability can co-exist in CA1, likely driven by different neurophysiological and plasticity mechanisms.",

Otolith analyzes often require the production of a thin cross section that includes in the same plane of view the otolith core and all microscopic layers formed from birth until the moment of collection (otolith edge). Here we report on the usefulness of UV-cured resins that have become recently popular among nail artists and hobbyists for otolith specimen preparation. We show that single-component UV-cured resins can replace successfully and advantageously the commonly used two-component Epoxy resins to obtain otolith cross sections suitable for both microstructural examination and chemical analysis by electron probe microanalysis. UV-cured resins provide on-demand, extremely rapid (minute-order) hardening and high transparency, while providing similar adhesion and mechanical support for the otoliths during processing and analysis as Epoxy resins. UV-cured resins may revolutionize otolith specimen preparation practically- and time-wise, and may be particularly useful in teaching and workshop situations in which time for otolith embedding is a constraint.",

    "abstract": "Early marine survival of juvenile salmon is intimately associated with their physiological condition during ocean entry and especially smoltification. Smoltification is a developmental parr-smolt transformation allowing salmon to acquire the trait of seawater tolerance in preparation for marine living. Traditionally, this developmental process has been monitored using gill Na+/K+ATPase (NKA) activity or plasma hormones, but gill gene expression can be reliably used. Here, we describe the discovery of candidate genes from gill tissue for staging smoltification using comparisons of microarray studies with particular focus on the commonalities between anadromous Rainbow trout and Sockeye salmon datasets, as well as literature comparison encompassing more species. A subset of 37 candidate genes mainly from the microarray analyses was used for Taq-Man qPCR assay design and their monthly expression patterns were validated using gill samples from four groups, representing three species and two ecotypes: Coho salmon, Sockeye salmon, stream-type Chinook salmon, and ocean-type Chinook salmon. The best smoltification biomarkers, as measured by consistent changes across these four groups, were genes involved in ion regulation, oxygen transport, and immunity. Smoltification gene expression patterns (using the top 10 biomarkers) were confirmed by significant correlations with NKA activity and were associated with changes in body brightness, caudal fin darkness, and caudal peduncle length. We incorporate gene expression patterns of pre-smolt, smolt, and de-smolt trials from acute seawater transfers using a companion study to develop a preliminary seawater tolerance classification model for ocean-type Chinook salmon. This work demonstrates the potential of gene expression biomarkers to stage smoltification and classify juveniles as pre-smolt, smolt, or de-smolt.",

    "abstract": "How pathogenic CD4 T cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) develop remains poorly understood. We used Nur77--a marker of T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling--to identify antigen-activated CD4 T cells in the SKG mouse model of autoimmune arthritis and in patients with RA. Using a fluorescent reporter of Nur77 expression in SKG mice, we found that higher levels of Nur77-eGFP in SKG CD4 T cells marked their autoreactivity, arthritogenic potential, and ability to more readily differentiate into IL-17 producing cells. Moreover, the enhanced autoreactivity was associated with upregulation of IL-6 cytokine signaling machinery. As a result, the more autoreactive GFPhi CD4 T cells from SKGNur mice were hyper-responsive to IL-6. This suggests that, despite impaired TCR signaling, autoreactive T cells exposed to chronic antigen stimulation exhibit heightened sensitivity to IL-6 which contributes to the arthritogenicity in SKG mice, and perhaps in patients with RA. Additionally, endogenous Nur77 protein expression was enriched in a subset of synovial CD4 T cells from arthritic joints in SKG mice, consistent with antigen-activated T cells. This was was extended to patients with seropositive RA, suggesting that pathogenic CD4 T cells are enriched in RA joints and are likely recognizing an intra-articular auto-antigen(s).",

Although the IC plays important roles in speech processing, sound localization, and other auditory computations, the organization of the IC microcircuitry remains largely unknown. Using a multifaceted approach in mice, we have identified vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons as a novel class of IC principal neurons. VIP neurons are glutamatergic stellate cells with sustained firing patterns. Their extensive axons project to long-range targets including the auditory thalamus, auditory brainstem, superior colliculus, and periaqueductal gray. Using optogenetic circuit mapping, we found that VIP neurons integrate input from the contralateral IC and the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The dorsal cochlear nucleus also drove feedforward inhibition to VIP neurons, indicating that inhibitory circuits within the IC shape the temporal integration of ascending inputs. Thus, VIP neurons are well-positioned to influence auditory computations in a number of brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Decisions must be implemented through actions, and actions are prone to error. As such, when an expected outcome is not obtained, an individual should not only be sensitive to whether the choice itself was suboptimal, but also whether the action required to indicate that choice was executed successfully. The intelligent assignment of credit to action execution versus action selection has clear ecological utility for the learner. To explore this scenario, we used a modified version of a classic reinforcement learning task in which feedback indicated if negative prediction errors were, or were not, associated with execution errors. Using fMRI, we asked if prediction error computations in the human striatum, a key substrate in reinforcement learning and decision making, are modulated when a failure in action execution results in the negative outcome. Participants were more tolerant of non-rewarded outcomes when these resulted from execution errors versus when execution was successful but the reward was withheld. Consistent with this behavior, a model-driven analysis of neural activity revealed an attenuation of the signal associated with negative reward prediction error in the striatum following execution failures. These results converge with other lines of evidence suggesting that prediction errors in the mesostriatal dopamine system integrate high-level information during the evaluation of instantaneous reward outcomes.",

Application to the sequencing data derived from an HBV integrated human cell line(PLC/PRF/5) indicated that TSD could recover the full profile of HBV integration events, especially for the regions with the complex human-HBV genome integrations and multiple HBV rearrangements.

    "abstract": "Maspin (SERPINB5) is a potential tumor suppressor gene with pleiotropic biological activities, including regulation of cell proliferation, death, adhesion, migration and gene expression. Several studies suggest that subcellular localization plays an essential role on maspin tumor suppression activity. In this study we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying maspin nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. An in vitro nuclear-import assay using digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells demonstrated that maspin enters the nucleus by an energy-and carrier-independent mechanism. However, previous studies indicated that maspin subcellular localization is regulated in the cell. Using a nuclear localization signal (NLS) prediction software, we identified a putative NLS in the maspin amino acid sequence. To distinguish between passive and regulated nuclear translocation, maspinNLS or the full-length protein (MaspinFL) were fused to 5GFP, rendering the construct too large to enter the nucleus passively. Unexpectedly, 5GFP-maspinNLS, but not maspinFL-5GFP, entered the nucleus of HeLa cells. Dominant-negative Ran-GTPase mutants RanQ69L or RanT24N, suppressed 5GFP-maspinNLS nuclear localization. In summary, we provide evidence that maspin translocates to the nucleus passively. In addition, we identified a peptide in the maspin protein sequence, which is able to drive a 5GFP construct to the nucleus in an energy-dependent manner.",

We present a new Atlantis dsDNase-based technology, aFARP-ChIP-seq, that provides accurate profiling of genome-wide histone modifications in as few as 100 cells. By mapping histone lysine trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K27Ac in group I innate lymphoid cells from different tissues, aFARP-ChIP-seq uncovers potentially distinct active promoter and enhancer landscapes of several tissue-specific NK and ILC1. aFARP-ChIP-seq is also highly effective in mapping transcription factor binding sites in small number of cells.

CD8 depletion delayed serum viremia and dysregulated patterns of innate immune cell homing and monocyte-driven transcriptional responses in the blood. CD8-depleted macaques also showed evidence of compensatory adaptive immune responses, with elevated Th1 activity and persistence of neutralizing antibodies beyond the clearance of serum viremia. The absence of CD8+ lymphocytes increased viral burdens in lymphatic tissues, semen, and cerebrospinal fluid, and neural lesions were also evident in both CD8-depleted rhesus macaques.

Yet the functional significance of 6mA remains elusive due to its low abundance, difficulty of manipulation within native DNA, and lack of understanding of eukaryotic 6mA writers. Here, we report a novel DNA 6mA methyltransferase in ciliates, termed MTA1. The enzyme contains an MT-A70 domain but is phylogenetically distinct from all known RNA and DNA methyltransferases. Disruption of MTA1 in vivo leads to the genome-wide loss of 6mA in asexually growing cells and abolishment of the consensus ApT dimethylated motif. Genes exhibit subtle changes in chromatin organization or RNA expression upon loss of 6mA, depending on their starting methylation level. Mutants fail to complete the sexual cycle, which normally coincides with a peak of MTA1 expression. Thus, MTA1 functions in a developmental stage-specific manner. We determine the impact of 6mA on chromatin organization in vitro by reconstructing complete, full-length ciliate chromosomes harboring 6mA in native or ectopic positions. Using these synthetic chromosomes, we show that 6mA directly disfavors nucleosomes in vitro in a local, quantitative manner, independent of DNA sequence. Furthermore, the chromatin remodeler ACF can overcome this effect. Our study identifies a novel MT-A70 protein necessary for eukaryotic 6mA methylation and defines the impact of 6mA on chromatin organization using epigenetically defined synthetic chromosomes.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThe MT-A70 protein MTA1 mediates DNA N6-adenine methylation in Oxytricha\\nC_LIO_LIMTA1 mutants exhibit subtle changes in nucleosome organization and transcription in vivo\\nC_LIO_LI6mA directly disfavors nucleosome occupancy in natural and synthetic chromosomes in vitro\\nC_LIO_LIDe novo synthesis of complete, epigenetically defined Oxytricha chromosomes\\nC_LI",

However, the metabolic status of the recipient pre-transplant also has the potential to influence this outcome and has never been studied before and has the potential to enable risk stratification with respect to the development of transplant associated complications such as graft vs. host disease (GVHD). In order to better understand this aspect of transplant related complications we investigated the pre-transplantation metabolic signature to assess the possibility of pre-transplant risk stratification. This pilot study was composed of 14 patients undergoing myeloablative conditioning followed by either HLA matched related, unrelated donor, or autologous stem cell transplantation. Blood samples were taken prior to transplant and the plasma was comprehensively characterized with respect to its lipidome and metabolome via LCMS and GCMS. The results indicated a significantly pro-inflammatory metabolic profile in patients who eventually developed Graft vs. Host Disease (GVHD). The data revealed 5 potential pre-transplant biomarkers (1-monopalmitin, diacylglycerol (DG) 38:5, DG 38:6, 2-aminobutyric acid, and fatty acid (FA) 20:1) that demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity towards predicting post-transplant GVHD development. The predictive model developed demonstrated an estimated predictive accuracy of risk stratification of 100%, with an Area under the Curve of the ROC of 0.995 with 100%. The likelihood ratio of 1-monopalmitin (infinity), DG 38:5 (6.0) and DG 38:6 (6.0) also demonstrated that a patient with a positive test result for these biomarkers pre-transplant will likely have very high odds of developing GVHD post-transplant. Collectively the data demonstrates the possibility of using pre-transplant metabolic signature for risk stratification of SCT recipients with respect to development of GVHD.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies suggest that the placental supply of nutrients to the fetus adapts according to fetal demand. However, the signaling events underlying placental adaptations remain largely unknown. Earlier work in mice has revealed that loss of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110 impairs feto-placental growth but placental nutrient supply is adaptively increased. Here we explore the role of p110 in the epiblast-derived (fetal) and trophoblast lineages of the conceptus in relation to feto-placental growth and placental development and transfer function. Using conditional gene manipulations to knock-down p110 either by [~]50% or [~]100% in the fetal lineages and/or trophoblast, this study shows that p110 in the fetus is essential for prenatal development and a major regulator of placental phenotype in mice. Complete loss of fetal p110 caused embryonic death, whilst heterozygous loss resulted in fetal growth restriction and impaired placental formation and nutrient transport. Loss of trophoblast p110 also resulted in abnormal placental development, although fetuses were viable. However, in response to complete loss of trophoblast p110, the placenta failed to transport sufficient amino acid to match fetal demands for growth. Using RNA-seq, we identified several genes downstream of p110 in the trophoblast that are important in adapting placental phenotype to support fetal growth. Further work using CRISPR/Cas9 genome targeting showed that loss of p110 differentially affects the expression of genes in trophoblast and embryonic stem cells. Our findings thus reveal important, but distinct roles for p110 signaling in the different compartments of the conceptus, which control fetal resource acquisition and ultimately affect healthy growth.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryFetal and trophoblast p110 modify resource allocation",

    "abstract": "Recalcitrant polymers are widely distributed in the environment. This includes natural polymers, such as chitin, but synthetic polymers are becoming increasingly abundant, for which biodegradation is uncertain. Distribution of labour in microbial communities commonly evolves in nature, particularly for arduous processes, suggesting a community may be better at degrading recalcitrant compounds than individual microorganisms. Artificial selection of microbial communities with better degradation potential has seduced scientists for over a decade, but the method has not been systematically optimised nor applied to polymer degradation. Using chitin as a case study, we successfully selected for microbial communities with enhanced chitinase activities but found that continuous optimisation of incubation times between selective generations was of utmost importance. The analysis of the community composition over the entire selection process revealed fundamental aspects in microbial ecology: when incubation times between generations were optimal, the system was dominated by Gammaproteobacteria, main bearers of chitinase enzymes and drivers of chitin degradation, before being succeeded by cheating, cross-feeding and grazing organisms.\\n\\nImportanceArtificial selection is a powerful and atractive technique that can enhance the biodegradation of a recalcitrant polymer and other pollutants by microbial communities. We show, for the first time, that the success of artificially selecting microbial communities requires an optimisation of the incubation times between generations when implementing this method. Hence, communities need to be transferred at the peak of the desired activity in order to avoid community drift and replacement of the efficient biodegrading community by cheaters, cross-feeders and grazers.",

    "abstract": "Spoken language is thought to be facilitated by an ensemble of predictive mechanisms, yet the neurobiology of prediction for both speech perception and production remains unknown. We used intracranial recordings (31 patients, 6580 electrodes) from depth probes implanted along the anteroposterior extent of the supratemporal plane during rhythm listening, speech perception, and speech production. This revealed a frequency-multiplexed encoding of sublexical features during entrainment and a traveling wave of high-frequency activity across Heschls gyrus. Critically, we isolated two predictive mechanisms in early auditory cortex with distinct anatomical and functional characteristics. The first mechanism, localized to bilateral Heschls gyrus and indexed by low-frequency phase, predicts the timing of acoustic events (\\\"when\\\"). The second mechanism, localized to planum temporale in the language-dominant hemisphere and indexed by gamma power, predicts the acoustic consequence of speech motor plans (\\\"what\\\"). This work grounds cognitive models of speech perception and production in human neurobiology, illuminating the fundamental acoustic infrastructure - both architecture and function - for spoken language.",

    "abstract": "Expression of DAZ-like (DAZL) is a hallmark of vertebrate germ cells and essential for embryonic germ cell development and differentiation, yet gametogenic function of DAZL has not been fully characterized with most of its in vivo direct targets unknown. We showed that postnatal stage-specific deletion of Dazl in mouse germ cells did not affect female fertility, but caused complete male sterility with gradual loss of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), meiotic arrest and spermatid arrest respectively. Using the genome-wide HITS-CLIP and mass spectrometry approach, we found that DAZL bound to a large number of testicular mRNA transcripts (at least 3008) at 3' UnTranslated Region (3' UTR) and interacted with translation proteins including PABP. In the absence of DAZL, polysome-associated target transcripts, but not their total transcripts were significantly decreased, resulting in drastic reduction of an array of spermatogenic proteins and thus developmental arrest. Thus, DAZL is a master translational regulator essential for spermatogenesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNeurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) risk genes have pleiotropic biological functions, such as control over both developmental and non-developmental processes that influence disease-related phenotypes. Currently, it remains unclear how developmental versus non-developmental processes influence the duration and/or effectiveness of permissive treatment windows for NDDs. SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency causes an NDD defined by autistic traits, cognitive impairment, and epilepsy. Syngap1 heterozygosity in mice disrupts a developmental critical period, and, consistent with this, certain behavioral abnormalities are resistant to gene therapy initiated in adulthood. However, the Syngap1 endophenotype is extensive and this protein has diverse cell biological functions. Therefore, SynGAP pleiotropy may influence the permissive treatment window for previously untested disease-relevant phenotypes.\\n\\nMethodsA whole-body gene restoration technique was used to determine how restoration of SynGAP protein in adult heterozygous mice impacted previously untested phenotypes, such as memory, seizure susceptibility, systems-level cortical hyperexcitability, and hippocampal oscillations linked to mnemonic processes.\\n\\nResultsAdult restoration of SynGAP protein in haploinsufficient mice reversed long-term contextual memory deficits and behavioral measures of seizure susceptibility. Moreover, SynGAP re-expression in adult mice eliminated brain state-dependent, patient-linked paroxysmal interictal spiking and increased the amplitude of hippocampal theta oscillations.\\n\\nConclusionsSynGAP protein in the mature brain dynamically regulates neural circuit function and influences disease-relevant phenotypes. The impact of these findings is that treatments targeting certain debilitating aspects of SYNGAP1-related disorders may be effective throughout life. Moreover, the efficacy of experimental treatments for SYNGAP1 patients may be quantifiable through changes in species-conserved, state-dependent pathological electroencephalogram signals.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing model of microRNA function is that the \\\"seed\\\" region (nucleotides 2-8) is typically sufficient to mediate target recognition and repression. However, numerous recent studies have challenged this model, either by demonstrating extensive 3 pairing between physically defined miRNA-mRNA pairs or by showing in C. elegans that disrupted 3 pairing can result in impaired function in vivo. To test the importance of miRNA 3 pairing in a mammalian system in vivo, we engineered a mutant murine mir-146a allele in which the 5 half of the mature microRNA retains its wild-type sequence, but the 3 half has been altered to be anti-complementary. Mice homozygous or hemizygous for this mutant allele are phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type controls and do not recapitulate any of the immunopathology previously described for mir-146a-null mice. Our results indicate that 3 pairing is dispensable for the established myeloid function of this key mammalian microRNA.\\n\\nSummary Blurb3 sequence identity is dispensable for the established function of a mammalian miRNA in vivo.",

However, its application to study cancerous tissues is currently hampered by the lack of coverage across key mutation hotspots in the vast majority of cells, which prevents correlation of genetic and transcriptional readouts from the same single cell. To overcome this, we developed TARGET-seq, a method for the high-sensitivity detection of multiple mutations within single-cells from both genomic and coding DNA, in parallel with unbiased, high-depth whole transcriptome analysis. We demonstrate how this technique uniquely resolves transcriptional and genetic tumor heterogeneity in myeloproliferative neoplasm stem/progenitor cells, providing insights into deregulated pathways of mutant and non-mutant cells. TARGET-seq provides a powerful tool to resolve molecular signatures of genetically distinct subclones of tumor cells.",

The egg production and related performances include egg quality, yolk cholesterol, yolk fatty acid, quails jejunum morphology, and relative gene expression were determined in this study. Compared to the standard diet group, birds fed the 1% IPFF showed a higher egg production (87.7% on average, 11.5% above the control; P<0.01). The yolk fatty acid composition and n6/n3 ratio were affected by IPFF or IPR. Compared to the standard diet group, the egg cholesterol content was lower in both IPFF and IPR groups, and the yolk n6/n3 ratio in the 5% IPFF group (10.3; P<0.01) was more reasonable. Meanwhile, birds under IPFF dietary supplement showed a thicker jejunum wall, higher villus, and deeper crypt than the standard diet group. In addition, the altered mRNA expression of four genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acids metabolism (SREBP-1, SREBP-2, ADGL, APOVLDL-II) in the 1% IPFF group and 5% IPR group indicated that the lipids metabolism and transportation were enhanced in the interclavicular fat pad and liver, relative to the standard diet group.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSEgg production was higher in IPFF groups\n\nEgg cholesterol was lower in IPFF groups\n\nLipid metabolism and transportation was enhanced in IPFF groups\n\nIntestine wall was thicker in IPFF groups",

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence supports the notion that variation in gene regulation plays a crucial role in both speciation and adaptation. However, a comprehensive functional understanding of the mechanisms underlying regulatory evolution remains elusive. In primates, one of the crucial missing pieces of information towards a better understanding of regulatory evolution is a comparative annotation of interactions between distal regulatory elements and promoters. Chromatin conformation capture technologies have enabled genome-wide quantifications of such distal 3D interactions. However, relatively little comparative research in primates has been done using such technologies. To address this gap, we used Hi-C to characterize 3D chromatin interactions in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from humans and chimpanzees. We also used RNA-sequencing to collect gene expression data from the same lines. We generally observed that lower-order, pairwise 3D genomic interactions are conserved in humans and chimpanzees, but higher order genomic structures, such as TADs, are not as conserved. Inter-species differences in 3D genomic interactions are often associated with gene expression differences between the species. To provide additional functional context to our observations, we considered previously published chromatin data from human iPSCs. We found that inter-species differences in 3D genomic interactions, which are also associated with gene expression differences between the species, are enriched for both active and repressive marks. Overall, our data demonstrates that, as expected, an understanding of 3D genome reorganization is key to explaining regulatory evolution.",

    "abstract": "Recently we proposed that people represent object categories using category-consistent features (CCFs), those features that occur both frequently and consistently across a categorys exemplars [70]. Here we designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) after the primate ventral stream (VsNet) and used it to extract CCFs from 68 categories of objects spanning a three-level category hierarchy. We evaluated VsNet against people searching for the same targets from the same 68 categories. Not only did VsNet replicate our previous report of stronger attention guidance to subordinate-level targets, with its more powerful CNN-CCFs it was able to predict attention control to individual target categories-the more CNN-CCFs extracted for a category, the faster gaze was directed to the target. We also probed VsNet to determine where in its network of layers these attention control signals originate. We found that CCFs extracted from VsNets V1 layer contributed most to guiding attention to targets cued at the subordinate (e.g., police car) and basic (e.g., car) levels, but that guidance to superordinate-cued (e.g., vehicle) targets was strongest using CCFs from the CIT+AIT layer. We also identified the image patches eliciting the strongest filter responses from areas V4 and higher and found that they depicted representative parts of an object category (e.g., advertisements appearing on top of taxi cabs). Finally, we found that VsNet better predicted attention control than comparable CNN models, despite having fewer convolutional filters. This work shows that a brain-inspired CNN can predict goal-directed attention control by extracting and using category-consistent features.",
