    "abstract": "In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA associates with numerous protein complexes and RNAs, forming the chromatin landscape. Through a genome-wide study of chromatin-associated proteins in Drosophila cells, five major chromatin types were identified as a refinement of the traditional binary division into hetero- and euchromatin. These five types are defined by distinct but overlapping combinations of proteins and differ in biological and biochemical properties, including transcriptional activity, replication timing and histone modifications. In this work, we assess the evolutionary relationships of chromatin-associated proteins and present an integrated view of the evolution and conservation of the fruit fly D. melanogaster chromatin landscape. We combine homology prediction across a wide range of species with gene age inference methods to determine the origin of each chromatin-associated protein. This provides insight into the emergence of the different chromatin types. Our results indicate that the two euchromatic types, YELLOW and RED, were one single activating type that split early in eukaryotic history. Next, we provide evidence that GREEN-associated proteins are involved in a centromere drive and expanded in a lineage-specific way in D. melanogaster. Our results on BLUE chromatin support the hypothesis that the emergence of Polycomb Group proteins is linked to eukaryotic multicellularity. In light of these results, we discuss how the regulatory complexification of chromatin links to the origins of eukaryotic multicellularity.",

    "abstract": "Our genomes encode a wealth of transcription initiation regions (TIRs) that can be identified by their distinctive patterns of actively elongating RNA polymerase. We previously introduced dREG to identify TIRs using PRO-seq data. Here we introduce an efficient new implementation of dREG that uses PRO-seq data to identify both uni- and bidirectionally transcribed TIRs with 70% improvements in accuracy, 3-4-fold higher resolution, and >100-fold increases in computational efficiency. Using a novel strategy to identify TIRs based on their statistical confidence reveals extensive overlap with orthogonal assays, yet also reveals thousands of additional weakly-transcribed TIRs that were not identified by H3K27ac ChIP-seq or DNase-I-hypersensitivity. Novel TIRs discovered by dREG were often associated with RNA polymerase III initiation, bound by pioneer transcription factors, or located in broad domains marked by repressive chromatin modifications. We provide a web interface to dREG that can be used by the scientific community (http://dREG.DNASequence.org).",

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, food-driven allergic disease resulting in eosinophilic esophageal inflammation. We recently found that EoE susceptibility is associated with genetic variants in the promoter of CAPN14, a gene with reported esophagus-specific expression. CAPN14 is dynamically up-regulated as a function of EoE disease activity and after exposure of epithelial cells to interleukin-13 (IL-13). Herein, we aimed to explore molecular modulation of CAPN14 expression. We identified three putative binding sites for the IL-13-activated transcription factor STAT6 in the promoter and first intron of CAPN14. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that the two most distal STAT6 elements were required for the ~10-fold increase in promoter activity subsequent to stimulation with IL-13 or IL-4, and also for the genotype-dependent reduction in IL-13-induced promoter activity. One of the STAT6 elements in the promoter was necessary for IL-13-mediated induction of CAPN14 promoter activity while the other STAT6 promoter element was necessary for full induction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation in IL-13 stimulated esophageal epithelial cells was used to further support STAT6 binding to the promoter of CAPN14 at these STAT6 binding sites. The highest CAPN14 and calpain-14 expression occurred with IL-13 or IL-4 stimulation of esophageal epithelial cells under culture conditions that allow the cells to differentiate into a stratified epithelium. This work corroborates a candidate molecular mechanism for EoE disease etiology in which the risk variant at 2p23 dampens mediated CAPN14 expression in differentiated esophageal epithelial cells following IL-13/STAT6 induction of CAPN14 promoter activity.",

    "abstract": "The geometry of cells is well described by membrane curvature. Septins are filament forming, GTP-binding proteins that assemble on positive, micrometer-scale curvatures. Here, we examine the molecular basis of curvature sensing by septins. We show that differences in affinity and the number of binding sites drive curvature-specific adsorption of septins. Moreover, we find septin assembly onto curved membranes is cooperative and show that geometry influences higher-order arrangement of septin filaments. Although septins must form polymers to stay associated with membranes, septin filaments do not have to span micrometers in length to sense curvature, as we find that single septin complexes have curvature-dependent association rates. We trace this ability to an amphipathic helix (AH) located on the C-terminus of Cdc12. The AH domain is necessary and sufficient for curvature sensing both in vitro and in vivo. These data show that curvature sensing by septins operates at much smaller length scales than the micrometer curvatures being detected.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys are increasingly being used for biodiversity monitoring, principally because they are sensitive and can provide high resolution community composition data. Despite considerable progress in recent years, eDNA studies examining how different environmental sample types can affect species detectability remain rare. Comparisons of environmental samples are especially important for providing best practice guidance on early detection and subsequent mitigation of non-indigenous species. Here we used eDNA metabarcoding of COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) and 18S (nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA) genes to compare community composition between sediment and water samples in artificial coastal sites across the United Kingdom. We first detected markedly different communities and a consistently greater number of distinct operational taxonomic units in sediment compared to water. We then compared our eDNA datasets with previously published rapid assessment biodiversity surveys and found excellent concordance among the different survey techniques. Finally, our eDNA surveys detected many non-indigenous species, including several newly introduced species, highlighting the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for both early detection and temporal / spatial monitoring of non-indigenous species. We conclude that careful consideration on environmental sample type is needed when conducting eDNA surveys, especially for studies assessing community change.",

    "abstract": "Animals readily execute learned motor behaviors in a consistent manner over long periods of time, yet similarly stable neural correlates remained elusive up to now. How does the cortex achieve this stable control? Using the sensorimotor system as a model of cortical processing, we investigated the hypothesis that the dynamics of neural latent activity, which capture the dominant co-variation patterns within the neural population, are preserved across time. We recorded from populations of neurons in premotor, primary motor, and somatosensory cortices for up to two years as monkeys performed a reaching task. Intriguingly, despite steady turnover in the recorded neurons, the low-dimensional latent dynamics remained stable. Such stability allowed reliable decoding of behavioral features for the entire timespan, while fixed decoders based on the recorded neural activity degraded substantially. We posit that latent cortical dynamics within the manifold are the fundamental and stable building blocks underlying consistent behavioral execution.",

    "abstract": "Consensus sequence design offers a promising strategy for designing proteins of high stability while retaining biological activity since it draws upon an evolutionary history in which residues important for both stability and function are likely to be conserved. Although there have been several reports of successful consensus design of individual targets, it is unclear from these anecdotal studies how often this approach succeeds, and how often it fails. Here, we attempt to assess generality by designing consensus sequences for a set of six protein families with a range of chain-lengths, structures, and activities. We characterize the resulting consensus proteins for stability, structure, and biological activities in an unbiased way. We find that all six consensus proteins adopt cooperatively folded structures in solution. Strikingly, four out of six of these consensus proteins show increased thermodynamic stability over naturally-occurring homologues. Each consensus protein tested for function maintained at least partial biological activity. Though peptide binding affinity by a consensus-designed SH3 is rather low, Km values for consensus enzymes are similar to values from extant homologues. Though consensus enzymes are slower than extant homologues at low temperature, they are faster than some thermophilic enzymes at high temperature. An analysis of sequence properties shows consensus proteins to be enriched in charged residues, and rarified in uncharged polar residues. Sequence differences between consensus and extant homologues are predominantly located at weakly conserved surface residues, highlighting the importance of these residues in the success of the consensus strategy.\\n\\nSignificance StatementA major goal of protein design is to create proteins that have high stability and biological activity. Drawing on evolutionary information encoded within extant protein sequences, consensus sequence design has produced several successes in achieving this goal. Here we explore the generality with which consensus design can be used to enhance protein stability and maintain biological activity. By designing and characterizing consensus sequences for six unrelated protein families, we find that consensus design shows high success rates in creating well-folded, hyperstable proteins that retain biological activities. Remarkably, many of these consensus proteins show higher stabilities than naturally-occurring sequences of their respective protein families. Our study highlights the utility of consensus sequence design and informs the mechanisms by which it works.",

Many computational algorithms developed for single-cell RNA-seq adopted gene selection and dimension reduction strategies to address the dropouts. Here, an opposite view is explored. Instead of treating dropouts as a problem to be fixed, we embrace it as a useful signal for defining cell types. We present an iterative co-occurrence clustering algorithm that works with binarized single-cell RNA-seq count data. Surprisingly, although all the quantitative information is removed after the data is binarized, co-occurrence clustering of the binarized data is able to effectively identify cell populations, as well as cell-type specific pathways. We demonstrate that the binary dropout patterns of the data provides not only overlapping but also complementary information compared to the quantitative gene expression counts in single-cell RNA-seq data.",

    "abstract": "PurposeAmpliSeq technology, the target enrichment method for next-generation sequencing (NGS), enables quick and easy detection of the genomic \\\"hot spot\\\" region frequently mutated in species. Even though the cost of NGS has decreased, library preparation cost accounts for a more significant proportion of the total cost. If AmpliSeq library can be prepared at a lower cost, large-scale precision oncology can be more easily carried out. Furthermore, this technology can be widely applied not only to medical research, but also to polymorphism detection in biology. This study aimed to reduce the cost of AmpliSeq library preparation by adopting miniaturization technology.\\n\\nMethodsWe used approximately 10 ng of genomic DNA for ultra-multiplex PCR of 384, 768, 1152, 1920, and 3072 amplicons. Multiplex PCR was performed in a total volume of 1.6, 2.0, and 2.4 L, using a nano-liter liquid handler, for library preparation.\\n\\nResultsThe success rate of library construction decreased with decreasing total multiplex PCR reaction volume. Using 1.6-, 2.0-, and 2.4-L reactions, the success rates of ultra-multiplex PCR were 25%, 95%, and 100%, respectively. We could stably create libraries of the correct amplicon size, with an amplicon number of approximately 1500 or less. As a result of NGS, uniformity of PCR amplification and read length of quality-checked libraries were hardly affected by the number of amplicons.\\n\\nConclusionHere, we show that the minimum volume for a stable reaction was 2.4 L and the maximum number of amplicons obtained was approximately 1500. The protocol saved 86.8% in reagent usage and reduced handling time by 85% compared to that required by the manual protocol. Therefore, miniaturization technologies could reduce the cost of AmpliSeq library preparation through minimization of reagents.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the deadliest gynecological cancer. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most frequently diagnosed and lethal histosubtype of EOC. A significant proportion of HGSC patients relapse with chemoresistant disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies for HGSC. Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer cells, and targeting metabolism for cancer therapy may be beneficial. Here we found that in comparison to normal fallopian tube epithelial cells, HGSC cells preferentially utilize glucose in the TCA cycle and not for aerobic glycolysis. This correlated with universally increased TCA cycle enzyme expression in HGSC cells under adherent conditions. To further differentiate the necessity of TCA cycle enzymes in ovarian cancer progression, we found that only wildtype isocitrate dehydrogenase I (IDH1) is both significantly increased in HGSC cells in spheroid conditions and is associated with reduced progression-free survival. IDH1 protein expression is also increased in primary HGSC patient tumors. Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of IDH1 decreased proliferation of multiple HGSC cell lines by inducing senescence. Mechanistically, suppression of IDH1 increased the repressive histone mark H3K9me2 at proliferation promoting gene loci (PCNA and MCM3), which led to decreased mRNA expression. Altogether, these data suggest that increased IDH1 activity is an important metabolic adaptation in HGSC and that targeting wildtype IDH1 in HGSC alters the repressive histone epigenetic landscape to induce senescence. Therefore, inhibition of IDH1 may act as a novel therapeutic approach to alter both the metabolism and epigenetics of HGSC as a pro-senescent therapy.",

As the enzymes executing the final stages of autophagy, lysosomal proteases (or cathepsins) are key contributors to maintenance of protein homeostasis with age. Here, we identify the cysteine-rich granulin peptides as a new class of regulators of lysosomal aspartyl protease activity. Granulins are produced in an age and stress-dependent manner through cleavage of the neurodegenerative disease protein, progranulin. Once liberated, granulins selectively interact with the aspartyl protease ASP-3/cathepsin D to impair enzymatic activity. Consequently, protein homeostasis and lysosome function is disrupted, prompting cells to activate a compensatory transcriptional program. Our results support a model in which granulin production modulates a critical transition between the normal, physiological regulation of protease activity and the impairment of lysosomal function that can occur with age and disease.",

Electrophysiological characterization of the active properties of these neurons throughout adulthood will help to address the biophysical and computational principles of the neuronal integration.\\n\\nFindingsHere we provide a database of whole-cell intracellular recordings from 315 neurons located in the supragranular layers (L2/3) of the primary somatosensory cortex in adult mice (9-45 weeks old) from both sexes (females, N=195; males, N=120). Data include 361 somatic current-clamp (CC) and 476 voltage-clamp (VC) experiments, recorded using a step-and-hold protocol (CC, N=257; VC, N=46), frozen noise injections (CC, N=104) and triangular voltage sweeps (VC, 10 (N=132), 50 (N=146) and 100 ms (N=152)), from regular spiking (N=169) and fast-spiking neurons (N=66).\\n\\nConclusionsThe data can be used to systematically study the properties of somatic integration, and the principles of action potential generation across sexes and across electrically characterized neuronal classes in adulthood. Understanding the principles of the somatic transformation of postsynaptic potentials into action potentials will shed light onto the computational principles of intracellular information transfer in single neurons and information processing in neuronal networks, helping to recreate neuronal functions in artificial systems.",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks have recently achieved many successes in solving sequential processing and planning tasks. Their success is often ascribed to the emergence of the tasks low-dimensional latent structure in the network activity - i.e., in the learned neural representations. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that a means for generating representations with easily accessed low-dimensional latent structure, possibly reflecting an underlying semantic organization, is through learning to predict observations about the world. Specifically, we ask whether and when network mechanisms for sensory prediction coincide with those for extracting the underlying latent variables. Using a recurrent neural network model trained to predict a sequence of observations we show that network dynamics exhibit low-dimensional but nonlinearly transformed representations of sensory inputs that map the latent structure of the sensory environment. We quantify these results using nonlinear measures of intrinsic dimensionality and linear decodability of latent variables, and provide mathematical arguments for why such useful predictive representations emerge. We focus throughout on how our results can aid the analysis and interpretation of experimental data.",

    "abstract": "The serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1A) system has been extensively implicated in modulating mood and behavior. Notably, 5-HT1A levels in humans display remarkable variation and differences in receptor levels have been linked with a variety of psychiatric disorders. Further, manipulation of receptor levels in mice suggests that changes in receptor levels that model existing human variation are sufficient to drive behavioral alterations. As a result, genetic mechanisms that modulate human 5-HT1A levels may be important for explaining individual differences in mood and behavior, representing a potential source of psychiatric disease risk. One common genetic variant implicated in differential 5-HT1A levels is the G/C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs6295, located upstream of the human 5-HT1A gene. This SNP differentially binds the transcription factor, NUDR/Deaf1, leading to cell-type specific effects on transcription in vitro. To investigate the direct effects of this SNP in the heterogeneous cellular context of the brain, we generated humanized transgenic mice using a design that maximized the local transcriptional landscape of the human HTR1A gene while also controlling for effects of genomic insertion location. Expression of the human transgene in a 5-HT1A null mouse resulted in line-dependent expression of human 5-HT1A. The effect of rs6295 on protein levels and behavior similarly differed across lines, suggesting that the penetrance of rs6295 may depend upon background genetic factors. Together, this work confirms that relatively subtle differences in 5-HT1A levels can contribute to differences in behavior and highlights the challenges of modeling human non-coding genetic variation in mice.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress and associated heightened glucocorticoid levels are risk factors for depression, a common non-motor symptom in Parkinsons disease (PD). However, how heightened glucocorticoids influence PD neuropathology [alpha-synuclein (-Syn) containing Lewy pathology and neurodegeneration] and disease progression is unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the impact of chronic corticosterone administration on -Syn pathology, neurodegeneration, behavior and mitochondrial function in a mouse model of -Syn pathology spreading after intracerebral injection of -Syn preformed fibrils (PFFs). Our results demonstrate that heightened corticosterone aggravates neurodegeneration and -Syn pathology spreading, intriguingly to specific brain regions, such as the entorhinal cortex. Corticosterone-treatment abolished distinct physiological adaptations after PFF-injection and induced differential physiological and behavioral consequences. Taken together, our work points to elevated glucocorticoids as a risk factor for the development of the neuropathological hallmarks of PD. Strategies aimed at reducing glucocorticoid levels might slow down pathology spreading and disease progression in synucleinopathy.",

    "abstract": "Exposure therapy is a first-line treatment for anxiety disorders but remains ineffective in a large proportion of patients. A proposed mechanism of exposure involves a form of inhibitory learning where the association between a stimulus and an aversive outcome is suppressed by a new association with an appetitive or neutral outcome. The blood pressure medication losartan augments fear extinction in rodents and might have similar synergistic effects on human exposure therapy, but the exact cognitive mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. In this study, we used a reinforcement learning paradigm with compound rewards and punishments to test the prediction that losartan augments learning from appetitive relative to aversive outcomes. Healthy volunteers (N=53) were randomly assigned to single-dose losartan (50mg) versus placebo. Participants then performed a reinforcement learning task which simultaneously probes appetitive and aversive learning. Participant choice behaviour was analysed using both a standard reinforcement learning model and by analysis of choice switching behaviour. Losartan significantly reduced learning rates from aversive events (losses) when participants were first exposed to the novel task environment, while preserving learning from positive outcomes. The same effect was seen in choice switching behaviour. Losartan enhances learning from positive relative to negative events. This effect may represent a computationally defined neurocognitive mechanism by which the drug could enhance the effect of exposure in clinical populations.",

    "abstract": "Resilience is the maintenance or rapid recovery of mental health during and after stressor exposure. It is becoming increasingly clear that resilience results from a complex and dynamic process of adaptation to stressors involving the biological, psychological and social levels. Positive appraisal style theory of resilience (PASTOR) claims that the common final pathway to maintained mental health lies in the non-negative (non-catastrophizing, non-pessimistic) appraisal of potential stressors, permitting the organism to fine-tune stress responses to optimal levels, thus avoiding unnecessary stress, inefficient deployment of resources and concomitant deleterious allostatic load effects. Successful adaptation consists in developing or strengthening a positive appraisal style. Another key element of PASTOR is that a positive appraisal style is strongly determined by the efficacy and efficiency of the neural and cognitive processes that underlie positive stressor appraisal. We here present a combined behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) battery designed to assess such processes repeatedly in longitudinal settings. The battery includes tests of stress reactivity and recovery, reward sensitivity, safety learning and memory in the context of fear conditioning and extinction, volitional situation-focused reappraisal, volitional self-focused reappraisal, and emotional interference inhibition, along with structural MRI and resting-state MRI scans. A detailed description of the battery methods is provided. The feasibility of the battery was successfully tested in N=55 healthy subjects; group results of the individual tasks largely replicate existing literature.",

    "abstract": "The spatial resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) can be increased from that of conventional SQUID-based systems by employing on-scalp sensor arrays of e.g. optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs). However, OPMs reach sufficient sensitivity for neuromagnetic measurements only when operated in a very low absolute magnetic field of few nanoteslas or less, usually not reached in a typical magnetically shielded room constructed for SQUID-based MEG. Moreover, field drifts affect the calibration of OPMs. Static and dynamic control of the ambient field is thus necessary for good-quality neuromagnetic measurements with OPMs. Here, we describe an on-scalp MEG system that utilizes OPMs and external compensation coils that provide static and dynamic shielding against ambient fields.\\n\\nIn a conventional two-layer magnetically shielded room, our coil system reduced the maximum remanent DC-field component within an 8-channel OPM array from 70 to less than 1 nT, enabling the sensors to operate in the sensitive spin exchange relaxation-free regime. When compensating field drifts below 4 Hz, a low-frequency shielding factor of 22 dB was achieved, which reduced the peak-to-peak drift from 1.3 to 0.4 nT and thereby the standard deviation of the sensor calibration from 1.6% to 0.4%. Without band-limiting the field that is compensated, a low-frequency shielding factor of 43 dB was achieved.\\n\\nWe validated the system by measuring brain responses to electric stimulation of the median nerve. With dynamic shielding and digital interference suppression methods, single-trial somatosensory evoked responses could be detected. Our results advance the deployment of OPM-based on-scalp MEG in lighter magnetic shields.",

    "abstract": "Discerning objects from their surrounds (i.e., figure-ground segmentation) in a way that guides adaptive behaviours is a fundamental task of the brain. Neurophysiological work has revealed a class of cells in the macaque visual cortex that may be ideally suited to support this neural computation: border-ownership cells (Zhou, Friedman, & von der Heydt, 2000). These orientation-tuned cells appear to respond conditionally to the borders of objects. A behavioural correlate supporting the existence of these cells in humans was demonstrated using two-dimensional luminance defined objects (von der Heydt, Macuda, & Qiu, 2005). However, objects in our natural visual environments are often signalled by complex cues, such as motion and depth order. Thus, for border-ownership systems to effectively support figure-ground segmentation and object depth ordering, they must have access to information from multiple depth cues with strict depth order selectivity. Here we measure in humans (of both sexes) border-ownership-dependent tilt aftereffects after adapting to figures defined by either motion parallax or binocular disparity. We find that both depth cues produce a tilt aftereffect that is selective for figure-ground depth order. Further, we find the effects of adaptation are transferable between cues, suggesting that these systems may combine depth cues to reduce uncertainty (Bulthoff & Mallot, 1988). These results suggest that border-ownership mechanisms have strict depth order selectivity and access to multiple depth cues that are jointly encoded, providing compelling psychophysical support for their role in figure-ground segmentation in natural visual environments.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSegmenting a visual object from its surrounds is a critical function that may be supported by \\\"border-ownership\\\" neural systems that conditionally respond to object borders. Psychophysical work indicates these systems are sensitive to objects defined by luminance contrast. To effectively support figure-ground segmentation, however, neural systems supporting border-ownership must have access to information from multiple depth cues and depth order selectivity. We measured border-ownership-dependent tilt aftereffects to figures defined by either motion parallax or binocular disparity and found aftereffects for both depth cues. These effects were transferable between cues, but selective for figure-ground depth order.

To address this, we generated two novel camelid single domain antibodies (nanobodies) specifically binding to SNAP-25 and Syntaxin 1A. These probes penetrated more easily into samples and detected their targets more efficiently than conventional antibodies in crowded regions. When investigated by super-resolution imaging, the nanobodies revealed substantial extra-synaptic populations for both SNAP-25 and Syntaxin 1A, which were poorly detected by antibodies. Moreover, extra-synaptic Syntaxin 1A molecules were recruited to synapses during stimulation, suggesting that these are physiologically-active molecules. We conclude that nanobodies are able to reveal qualitatively and quantitatively different organization patterns, when compared to conventional antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Innate behavioral reactions to sensory stimuli may be subject to modulation by contextual conditions including signals from other modalities. Whereas sensory processing by individual modalities has been well-studied, the cell circuit mechanisms by which signals from different sensory systems are integrated to control behavior remains poorly understood. Here, we provide a new behavioral model to study the mechanisms of multisensory integration. This behavior, which we termed odor-induced visual valence reversal, occurs when the innate avoidance response to a small moving object by flying Drosophila melanogaster is reversed by the presence of an appetitive odor. Instead of steering away from the small object representing an approaching threat, flies begin to steer towards the object in the presence of odor. Odor-induced visual valence reversal occurs rapidly without associative learning and occurs for attractive odors including apple cider vinegar and ethanol, but not for innately aversive benzaldehyde. Optogenetic activation of octopaminergic neurons robustly induces visual valence reversal in the absence of odor, as does optogenetic activation of directional columnar motion detecting neurons that express octopamine receptors. Optogenetic activation of octopamine neurons drives calcium responses in the motion detectors. Taken together, our results implicate a multisensory processing cascade in which appetitive odor activates octopaminergic neuromodulation of visual pathways, which leads to increased visual saliency and the switch from avoidance to approach toward a small visual object.",

Network formation has been widely associated with proteins producing membrane curvature and fusion, such as reticulons and atlastin. Regulated network fragmentation, occurring in different physiological contexts, is less understood. We found that the ER network has an embedded fragmentation mechanism based upon the ability of reticulons to produce fission of elongating network branches. In Drosophila, fission is counterbalanced by atlastin-driven fusion, with their imbalance leading to ER fragmentation. Live imaging of ER network dynamics upon ectopic expression of Drosophila reticulon linked fission to augmented membrane friction. Consistently, in vitro analysis revealed that purified reticulon produced velocity-dependent constriction and fission of lipid nanotubes pulled from a flat reservoir membrane. Fission occurred at elongation rates and pulling force ranges intrinsic to the ER network, thus suggesting a novel principle of organelle morphology regulation where the dynamic balance between fusion and fission is governed by membrane motility.",

    "abstract": "Ectopic R-loop accumulation causes DNA replication stress and genome instability. To avoid these outcomes, cells possess a range of anti-R-loop mechanisms, including RNaseH that degrades the RNA moiety in R-loops. To comprehensively identify anti-R-loop mechanisms, we performed a genome-wide trigenic interaction screen in yeast lacking RNH1 and RNH201. We identified >100 genes critical for fitness in the absence of RNaseH, which were enriched for DNA replication fork maintenance factors such as RAD50. We show in yeast and human cells that R-loops accumulate during RAD50 depletion. In human cancer cell models, we find that RAD50 and its partners in the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex regulate R-loop-associated DNA damage and replication stress. We show that a non-nucleolytic function of MRE11 is important for R-loop suppression via activation of PCNA-ubiquitination by RAD18 and recruiting anti-R-loop helicases in the Fanconi Anemia pathway. This work establishes a novel role for MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 in directing tolerance mechanisms of transcription-replication conflicts.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of the bacterial population that comprises the gut microbiota plays key roles in overall mammalian health. However, a detailed understanding of bacterial growth within the gut is limited by the inherent complexity and inaccessibility of the gut environment. Here, we deploy an improved synthetic genetic oscillator to investigate dynamics of bacterial colonization and growth in the mammalian gut under both healthy and disease conditions. The synthetic oscillator, when introduced into both Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium maintains regular oscillations with a constant period in generations across growth conditions. We determine the phase of oscillation from individual bacteria using image analysis of resultant colonies and thereby infer the number of cell divisions elapsed. In doing so, we demonstrate robust functionality and controllability of the oscillator circuits activity during bacterial growth in vitro, in a simulated murine gut microfluidic environment, and in vivo within the mouse gut. We determine different dynamics of bacterial colonization and growth in the gut under normal and inflammatory conditions. Our results show that a precise genetic oscillator can function in a complex environment and reveal single cell behavior under diverse conditions where disease may create otherwise impossible-to-quantify variability in growth across the population.",

    "abstract": "Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells by the forced expression of the OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC transcription factors. This process requires the reshaping of not only epigenetic landscapes, but the global remodeling of cell identity, structure, and function including such basic processes of metabolism and organelle form and function. Cellular reprogramming is a stochastic process with only a marginally measureable fraction of cells successfully crossing these, and many other, cellular epitomes to acquire the fully pluripotent state. We hypothesize that this variation is due, in part, by variable regulation of the proteostasis network and its influence upon the protein folding environment within cells and their organelles upon the remodeling process. We find that the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPRER), the heat-shock response (HSR) and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), which monitor and ensure the quality of the proteome of, respectively, the ER, the cytosol and the mitochondria during stress, are activated during cellular reprogramming. Particularly, we find that the UPRER is essential for reprograming, and ectopic, transient activation of the UPRER, either genetically or pharmacologically, enhances the success of cells to reach a pluripotent state. Finally, and most revealing, we find that stochastic activation of the UPRER can predict the reprogramming efficiency of naive cells. The results of these experiments indicate that the low efficiency and stochasticity of cellular reprogramming is partly the result of the inability to initiate a proper ER stress response for remodeling of the ER and its proteome during the reprogramming process. The results reported here display only one aspect of the proteostasis network and suggest that proper regulation of many more components of this network might be essential to acquire the pluripotent state.",

    "abstract": "Small RNAs (sRNAs) that are 21 to 24 nucleotides (nt) in length are found in most eukaryotic organisms and regulate numerous biological functions, including transposon silencing, development, reproduction, and stress responses, typically via control of the stability and/or translation of target mRNAs. Major classes of sRNAs in plants include microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs); sRNAs are known to travel as a silencing signal from cell to cell, root to shoot, and even between host and pathogen. In mammals, sRNAs are transported inside extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are mobile lipid compartments that participate in intercellular communication. In addition to sRNAs, EVs carry proteins, lipids, metabolites, and potentially other types of nucleic acids. Here we report that plant EVs also contain diverse species of sRNA. We found that specific miRNAs and siRNAs are preferentially loaded into plant EVs. We also report a previously overlooked class of \\\"tiny RNAs\\\" (10 to 17 nt) that are highly enriched in EVs. This new RNA category of unknown function has a broad and very diverse genome origin and might correspond to degradation products.",

    "abstract": "The amount of any given protein in the brain is determined by the rates of its synthesis and destruction, which are regulated by different cellular mechanisms. Here, we combine metabolic labelling in live mice with global proteomic profiling to simultaneously quantify both the flux and amount of proteins in mouse models of neurodegeneration. In multiple models, protein turnover increases were associated with increasing pathology. This method distinguishes changes in protein expression mediated by synthesis from those mediated by degradation. In the AppNL-F knockin mouse model of Alzheimers disease increased turnover resulted from imbalances in both synthesis and degradation, converging on proteins associated with synaptic vesicle recycling (Dnm1, Cltc, Rims1) and mitochondria (Fis1, Ndufv1). In contrast to disease models, ageing in wildtype mice caused a widespread decrease in protein recycling associated with a decrease in autophagic flux. This simple multidimensional approach enables the comprehensive mapping of proteome dynamics and identifies affected proteins in mouse models of disease and other live animal test settings.",

    "abstract": "ASMT is a key determinant of the levels of released melatonin. Though melatonin has been shown to exhibit anti-cancer activity and prevents endocrine resistance in breast cancer, the role of ASMT in breast cancer progression remains unclear. In this retrospective study, we analyzed gene expression profiles from thousands of patients and found that ASMT expression was significantly lower in breast cancer tumors relative to healthy tissue. Among cancer patients, those with greater expression had better relapse-free survival outcomes and longer metastasis-free survival times, and they also experienced longer periods before relapse or distance recurrence following tamoxifen treatment. Administration of melatonin, in combination with tamoxifen, further promoted cancer cell death by promoting apoptosis. Motivated by these results, we devised an ASMT gene signature that identifies low-risk cases with great accuracy. This signature was validated using both mRNA array and RNAseq datasets. Intriguingly, patients who are classified as high-risk benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, and those with grade II tumors who are classified as low-risk exhibit improved overall survival and distance relapse-free outcomes following endocrine therapy. Our findings more clearly elucidate the roles of ASMT, provide strategies for improving the efficacy of tamoxifen treatment, and help to identify those patients who may maximally benefit from adjuvant or endocrine therapies.",
