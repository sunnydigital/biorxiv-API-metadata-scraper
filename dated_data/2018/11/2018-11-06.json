    "abstract": "The expression of individual genes can be maintained through positive feedback loop mechanisms. If genes are expressed in bursts, then feedback either affects the frequency with which bursts occur or their size. Here we use a tractable hybrid modelling framework to evaluate how noncooperative positive feedback in burst frequency or burst size impacts the protein-level distribution. We confirm the results of previous studies that noncooperative positive feedback in burst frequency can support bimodal distributions. Intriguingly, bimodal distributions are unavailable in the case of feedback in burst size in the hybrid framework. However, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of a full discrete model show that bimodality can reappear due to low-copy number effects. The two types of feedbacks lead to dramatically different values of protein mean and noise. We show that small values of leakage imply a small protein mean for feedback in burst frequency but not necessarily for feedback in burst size. We also show that protein noise decreases in response to gene activation if feedback is in burst frequency but there is a transient noise amplification if feedback acts on burst size. Our results suggest that feedback in burst size and feedback in burst frequency may play fundamentally different roles in maintaining and controlling stochastic gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The introgression of a small segment of wheat chromosome 1BS in the distal region of the rye 1RS arm translocation in wheat (henceforth 1RSrw) was previously associated with reduced grain yield, carbon isotope discrimination and stomatal conductance, suggesting reduced access to soil moisture. In this study, we show that the 1RS/1RSRW polymorphism causes differences in root length in field and hydroponic experiments. In the latter, differences in seminal root length were associated with a developmentally regulated arrest of the root apical meristem (RAM). Approximately 10 days after germination, the seminal roots of the 1RSRW plants showed a gradual reduction in elongation rate and stopped growing a week later. Seventeen days after germination, the roots of the 1RSRW plants showed altered gradients of reactive oxygen species and emergence of lateral roots close to the RAM, suggesting a loss of apical dominance. The 1RS/1RSRW isogenic lines also differed in plant biomass and grain yield under normal, terminal drought, and waterlogging field conditions. The differences were larger in fields with reduced or excessive irrigation. These results suggest that this polymorphism may be useful to modulate root architecture and mitigate the negative impacts of excess or reduced water in wheat production.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTA wheat/rye polymorphism in chromosome one affects seminal root length and apical dominance and is associated with differences in drought and waterlogging tolerance in the field.",

    "abstract": "Interest in extracting mineral resources from the seafloor through deep-sea mining has accelerated substantially in the past decade, driven by increasing consumer demand for various metals like copper, zinc, manganese, cobalt and rare earth elements. While there are many on-going discussions and studies evaluating potential environmental impacts of deep-sea mining activities, these focus primarily on impacts to animal biodiversity. The microscopic spectrum of life on the seafloor and the services that this microbial realm provides in the deep sea are rarely considered explicitly. In April 2018, a community of scientists met to define the microbial ecosystem services that should be considered when assessing potential impacts of deep-sea mining, and to provide recommendations for how to evaluate these services. Here we show that the potential impacts of mining on microbial ecosystem services in the deep sea vary substantially, from minimal expected impact to complete loss of services that cannot be remedied by protected area offsets. We conclude by recommending that certain types of ecosystems should be \\\"off limits\\\" until initial characterizations can be performed, and that baseline assessments of microbial diversity, biomass, and biogeochemical function need to be considered in environmental impact assessments of all potential instances of deep-sea mining.",

    "abstract": "The root meristem is organized around a quiescent centre surrounded by stem cells that generate all cell types of the root. In the transit amplifying compartment progeny of stem cells further divide prior to differentiation. Auxin controls the size of this transit-amplifying compartment via Auxin Response Factors (ARF) that interact with Auxin Response Elements (AuxRE) in the promoter of their targets. The microRNA miR390 regulates abundance of ARF2, ARF3 and ARF4 by triggering the production of trans-acting (ta)-siRNA from TAS3. This miR390/TAS3/ARF regulatory module confers sensitivity and robustness to auxin responses in diverse developmental contexts. Here, we show that miR390 is expressed in the transit-amplifying compartment of the root meristem where it modulates response to auxin. A single AuxRE bound by ARF5/MONOPTEROS (MP) in miR390 promoter is necessary for miR390 expression in this compartment. We show that interfering with ARF5/MP dependent auxin signaling attenuates miR390 expression in the transit-amplifying compartment. Our results show that ARF5/MP regulates directly the expression of miR390 in the basal root meristem. We propose that ARF5, miR390 and the ta-siRNAs-regulated ARFs are necessary to maintain the size of the transit-amplifying region of the meristem.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryThe expression of miR390 in the Arabidopsis basal root meristem is controlled by ARF5/MONOPTEROS.",
