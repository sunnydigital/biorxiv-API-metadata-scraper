    "abstract": "Developmental system drift is a likely mechanism for the origin of hybrid incompatibilities between closely related species. We examine here the detailed mechanistic basis of hybrid incompatibilities for a genotype-phenotype map for developmental system drift under stabilising selection, where the organismal phenotype is conserved, but the underlying molecular phenotypes and genotype can drift. This leads to number of emergent phenomenon not obtainable by modelling genotype or phenotype alone. Our results show that: 1) speciation is more rapid at smaller population sizes with a characteristic, Orr-like, power law, but at large population sizes slow, characterised by a sub-diffusive growth law; 2) the molecular phenotypes under weakest selection contribute to the earliest incompatibilities; and 3) pairwise incompatibilities dominate over higher order, contrary to previous predictions that the latter should dominate. Our results indicate that biophysics and population size provide a much stronger constraint to speciation than suggested by previous models.",

    "abstract": "ARGONAUTES are the central effector proteins of RNA silencing which bind target transcripts in a small RNA-guided manner. Arabidopsis thaliana has ten ARGONAUTE (AGO) genes, with specialized roles in RNA-directed DNA methylation, post-transcriptional gene silencing, and antiviral defense. To better understand specialization among AGO genes at the level of transcriptional regulation we tested a library of 1497 transcription factors for binding to the promoters of AGO1, AGO10, and AGO7 using yeast 1-hybrid assays. A ranked list of candidate DNA-binding TFs revealed binding of the AGO7 promoter by a number of proteins in two families: the miR156-regulated SPL family and the miR319-regulated TCP family, both of which have roles in developmental timing and leaf morphology. Possible functions for SPL and TCP binding are unclear: we showed that these binding sites are not required for the polar expression pattern of AGO7, nor for the function of AGO7 in leaf shape. Normal AGO7 transcription levels and function appear to depend instead on an adjacent 124-bp region. Progress in understanding the structure of this promoter may aid efforts to understand how the conserved AGO7-triggered TAS3 pathway functions in timing and polarity.",

    "abstract": "Trio family and case-control studies of next-generation sequencing data have proven integral to understanding the contribution of rare inherited and de novo single-nucleotide variants to the genetic architecture of complex disease. Ideally, such studies should identify individual risk genes of moderate to large effect size to generate novel treatment hypotheses for further follow-up. However, due to insufficient power, gene set enrichment analyses have come to be relied upon for detecting differences between cases and controls, implicating sets of hundreds of genes rather than specific targets for further investigation. Here, we present a Bayesian statistical framework, termed gTADA, that integrates gene-set membership information with gene-level de novo and rare inherited case-control counts, to prioritize risk genes with excess rare variant burden within enriched gene sets. Applying gTADA to available whole-exome sequencing datasets for several neuropsychiatric conditions, we replicated previously reported gene set enrichments and identified novel risk genes. For epilepsy, gTADA prioritized 40 risk genes (posterior probabilities > 0.95), 6 of which replicate in an independent whole-genome sequencing study. In addition, 30/40 genes are novel genes. We found that epilepsy genes had high protein-protein interaction (PPI) network connectivity, and show specific expression during human brain development. Some of the top prioritized EPI genes were connected to a PPI subnetwork of immune genes and show specific expression in prenatal microglia. We also identified multiple enriched drug-target gene sets for EPI which included immunostimulants as well as known antiepileptics. Immune biology was supported specifically by case-control variants from familial epilepsies rather than do novo mutations in generalized encephalitic epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGene promoter methylation plays a critical role in a wide range of biological processes, such as transcriptional expression, gene imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, etc. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing generates a comprehensive profiling of the gene methylation levels but is limited by a high cost. Recent studies have partitioned the genes into landmark genes and target genes and suggested that the landmark gene expression levels capture adequate information to reconstruct the target gene expression levels. Moreover, the methylation level of the promoter is usually negatively correlated with its corresponding gene expression. This result inspired us to propose that the methylation level of the promoters might be adequate to reconstruct the promoter methylation level of target genes, which would eventually reduce the cost of promoter methylation profiling.\\n\\nResultsHere, we developed a deep learning model (D-GPM) to predict the whole-genome promoter methylation level based on the methylation profile of the landmark genes. We benchmarked D-GPM against three machine learning methods, namely, linear regression (LR), regression tree (RT) and support vector machine (SVM), based on two criteria: the mean absolute deviation (MAE) and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). After profiling the methylation beta value (MBV) dataset from the TCGA, with respect to MAE and PCC, we found that D-GPM outperforms LR by 9.59% and 4.34%, RT by 27.58% and 22.96% and SVM by 6.14% and 3.07% on average, respectively. For the number of better-predicted genes, D-GPM outperforms LR in 92.65% and 91.00%, RT in 95.66% and 98.25% and SVM in 85.49% and 81.56% of the target genes.\\n\\nConclusionsD-GPM acquires the least overall MAE and the highest overall PCC on MBV-te compared to LR, RT, and SVM. For a genewise comparative analysis, D-GPM outperforms LR, RT, and SVM in an overwhelming majority of the target genes, with respect to the MAE and PCC. Most importantly, D-GPM predominates among the other models in predicting a majority of the target genes according to the model distribution of the least MAE and the highest PCC for the target genes.",

    "abstract": "Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a eukaryotic mRNA surveillance system that selectively degrades transcripts with premature termination codons (PTC). Many RNA-binding proteins (RBP) regulate their expression levels by a negative feedback loop, in which RBP binds its own pre-mRNA and causes alternative splicing to introduce a PTC. We present a bioinformatic framework to identify novel such autoregulatory feedback loops by combining eCLIP assays for a large panel of RBPs with the data on shRNA inactivation of NMD pathway, and shRNA-depletion of RBPs followed by RNA-seq. We show that RBPs frequently bind their own pre-mRNAs and respond prominently to NMD pathway disruption. Poison and essential exons, i.e., exons that trigger NMD when included in the mRNA or skipped, respectively, respond oppositely to the inactivation of NMD pathway and to the depletion of their host genes, which allows identification of novel autoregulatory mechanisms for a number of human RBPs. For example, SRSF7 binds its own pre-mRNA and facilitates the inclusion of two poison exons; SFPQ binding promotes switching to an alternative distal 3-UTR that is targeted by NMD; RPS3 activates a poison 5-splice site in its pre-mRNA that leads to a frame shift; U2AF1 binding activates one of its two mutually exclusive exons, leading to NMD; TBRG4 is regulated by cluster splicing of its two essential exons. Our results indicate that autoregulatory negative feedback loop of alternative splicing and NMD is a generic form of post-transcriptional control of gene expression.",

Their topological structure includes nodes, edges, triangles and even higher-dimensional objects. Topological data analysis (TDA) is the emerging framework to process datasets under this perspective. In parallel, topology has proven essential for understanding fundamental questions in physics. Here we report the discovery of topological phase transitions in functional brain networks by merging concepts from TDA, topology, geometry, physics, and network theory. We show that topological phase transitions occur when the Euler entropy has a singularity, which remarkably coincides with the emergence of multidimensional topological holes in the brain network. Our results suggest that a major alteration in the pattern of brain correlations can modify the signature of such transitions, and may point to suboptimal brain functioning. Due to the universal character of phase transitions and noise robustness of TDA, our findings open perspectives towards establishing reliable topological and geometrical biomarkers of individual and group differences in functional brain network organization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSingle Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) array and re-sequencing technologies have different properties (e.g. calling rate, minor allele frequency profile) and drawback (e.g. ascertainment bias), which lead us to study the complementarity and consequences of using them separately or combined in diversity analyses and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). We performed GWAS on three traits (grain yield, plant height and male flowering time) measured in 22 environments on a panel of 247 diverse dent maize inbred lines using three genotyping technologies (Genotyping-By-Sequencing, Illumina Infinium 50K and Affymetrix Axiom 600K arrays).\\n\\nResultsThe effects of ascertainment bias of both arrays were negligible for deciphering global genetic trends of diversity in this panel and for estimating relatedness. We developed an original approach based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) extent in order to determine whether SNPs significantly associated with a trait and that are physically linked should be considered as a single QTL or several independent QTLs. Using this approach, we showed that the combination of the three technologies, which have different SNP distribution and density, allowed us to detect more Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs, gain in power) and potentially refine the localization of the causal polymorphisms (gain in position).\\n\\nConclusionsConceptually different technologies are complementary for detecting QTLs by tagging different haplotypes in association studies. Considering LD, marker density and the combination of different technologies (arrays and re-sequencing), the genotypic data presently available were most likely enough to well represent polymorphisms in the centromeric regions, whereas using more markers would be beneficial for telomeric regions.",

    "abstract": "African Lakes Cichlids are one of the most impressive example of adaptive radiation. Independently in Lake Victoria, Tanganyika, and Malawi, several hundreds of species arose within the last 10 million to 100,000 years. Whereas most analyses in Cichlids focused on nucleotide substitutions across species to investigate the genetic bases of this explosive radiation, to date, no study has investigated the contribution of structural variants (SVs) to speciation events (through a reduction of gene flow) and adaptation to different ecological niches. Here, we annotate and characterize the repertoires and evolutionary potential of different SV classes (deletion, duplication, inversion, insertions and translocations) in five Cichlid species (Haplochromis burtoni, Metriaclima zebra, Neolamprologus brichardi, Pundamilia nyererei and Oreochromis niloticus). We investigate the patterns of gain/loss across the phylogeny for each SV type enabling the identification of both lineage specific events and a set of conserved SVs, common to all four species in the radiation. Both deletion and inversion events show a significant overlap with SINE elements, while inversions additionally show a limited, but significant association with DNA transposons. Inverted regions are enriched for genes regulating behaviour, or involved in skeletal and visual system development. We also find that duplicated regions show enrichment for genes associated with \\\"antigen processing and presentation\\\" (GO:0019882) and other immune related categories. Altogether, we provide the first, comprehensive overview of rearrangement evolution in East African Cichlids, and some initial insights into their possible contribution to adaptation.",

    "abstract": "In most vertebrates, including zebrafish, the hypothalamic serotonergic cerebrospinal fluid-contacting (CSF-c) cells constitute a prominent population. In contrast to the hindbrain serotonergic neurons, little is known about the development and function of these cells. Here, we identify Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf)3 as the main Fgf ligand controlling the ontogeny of serotonergic CSF-c cells. We show that fgf3 positively regulates the number of serotonergic CSF-c cells, as well as a subset of dopaminergic and neuroendocrine cells in the posterior hypothalamus. Further, expression of the ETS-domain transcription factor etv5b is downregulated after fgf3 impairment. Previous findings identified etv5b as critical for the proliferation of serotonergic progenitors in the hypothalamus, and therefore we now suggest that Fgf3 acts via etv5b during early development to ultimately control the number of mature serotonergic CSF-c cells. Moreover, our analysis of the developing hypothalamic transcriptome shows that the expression of fgf3 is upregulated upon fgf3 loss-of-function, suggesting activation of a self-compensatory mechanism. Together, these results highlight Fgf3 in a novel context as part of a signalling pathway of critical importance for hypothalamic development.\\n\\nSummary statementThis study highlights Fgf3 in a novel context where it is being part of a signalling pathway of critical importance for development of hypothalamic monoaminergic cells in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "1. Life history theory predicts that reproductive investment draws resources away from immunity, resulting in increased parasitism. However, studies of reproductive tradeoffs rarely examine multiple measures of reproduction, immunity, and parasitism. It is therefore unclear whether the immune costs of reproductive traits correlate with their resource costs, and whether increased parasitism emerges from weaker immunity.\\n\\n2. We examined these relationships in wild female red deer (Cervus elaphus) with variable reproductive investment and longitudinal data on mucosal antibody levels and helminth parasitism. We noninvasively collected faecal samples, counting propagules of strongyle nematodes (order: Strongylida), the common liver fluke Fasciola hepatica and the red deer tissue nematode Elaphostrongylus cervi. We also quantified both total and anti-strongyle mucosal IgA to measure general and specific immune investment.\\n\\n3. Contrary to our predictions, we found that gestation was associated with decreased total IgA but with no increase in parasitism. Meanwhile, the considerable resource demand of lactation had no further immune cost but was associated with higher counts of strongyle nematodes and Elaphostrongylus cervi. These contrasting costs arose despite a negative correlation between antibodies and strongyle count, which implied that IgA was indicative of protective immunity.\\n\\n4. Our findings suggest that processes other than classical resource allocation tradeoffs are involved in mediating observed relationships between reproduction, immunity, and parasitism in wild mammals. In particular, reproduction-immunity tradeoffs may result from hormonal regulation or maternal antibody transfer, with parasitism increasing as a result of increased exposure arising from resource acquisition constraints. We advocate careful consideration of resource-independent mechanistic links and measurement of both immunity and parasitism when investigating reproductive costs.",

    "abstract": "Xist RNA, the master regulator of X chromosome inactivation, acts in cis to induce chromosome silencing through the stepwise recruitment of factors that modify underlying chromatin structure. Whilst considerable progress has been made towards defining key silencing factors and the elements to which they bind, their relative contribution to silencing different genes, and their relationship with one another is poorly understood. Here we describe a systematic analysis of Xist-mediated allelic silencing in ES cell-based models. We show that Spen, recruited through the Xist A-repeat, plays a central role, being critical for silencing of all except a subset of weakly expressed genes. Polycomb, recruited through the Xist B/C-repeat, also plays a key role, favouring silencing of genes with pre-existing H3K27me3 chromatin. LBR and the Rbm15/ m6A-methyltransferase complex, previously proposed to have a central role, make at most a minor contribution to gene silencing. We integrate our findings in a comprehensive model for Xist-mediated chromosome silencing.",

We describe MetABF, a simple Bayesian framework for performing integrative meta-analysis across multiple GWAS using summary statistics. The approach is applicable across a wide range of study designs and can increase the power by 50% compared to standard frequentist tests when only a subset of studies have a true effect. We demonstrate its utility in a meta-analysis of 20 diverse GWAS which were part of the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium 2.

Here, with this paper we provide an updated toolbox that is self contained within a Python package that includes new features such as graphical user interfaces and active-learning based network refinement.

    "abstract": "Degree of anesthesia in laboratory rodents is normally evaluated by testing loss of reflexes. While these are useful endpoint assessments, they are of limited application to study induction/reversal kinetics or factors affecting individual susceptibility (e.g. sex or age). We developed and validated a grading system for a temporal follow up of anesthesia. The Minho Objective Rodent Phenotypical Anesthesia (MORPhA) scale was tested in mice and rats anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/dexmedetomidine (ket/dex - 3 doses). The scale comprises 12 behavioral readouts organized in 5 stages - (i) normal/(ii) hindered voluntary movement, elicited response to (iii) non-noxious/(iv) noxious stimuli and (v) absence of response - evaluated at regular time points. Progression across stages was monitored by electroencephalography (EEG) in rats during anesthesia induction and reversal (atipamezole) and during induction with a second anesthetic drug (pentobarbital). Higher anesthetic doses decreased the time to reach higher levels of anesthesia during progression, while increasing the time to regain waking behavior during reversal, in mice and in rats. A regular decrease in high frequencies (low and high gamma) power was observed as the MORPhA score increased during anesthesia induction, while the opposite pattern was observed during emergence from anesthesia through reversion of dex effect. The devised anesthetic scale is of simple application and provides a semi-quantifiable readout of anesthesia induction/reversal.",

Financial market prices, and their volatility, present a convenient measure of informational load. Here we report on a study into the physiological response of traders in the City of London during a period of extreme, but declining, volatility. We sampled salivary cortisol, the main stress hormone, and the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- three times a day for two weeks. We found that average daily cortisol levels tracked closely an index of equity and bond volatility, as did levels of IL-1{beta}. Within-day cortisol and IL-1{beta} levels also tracked one hour lagged volatility. Interestingly, the cascade of endocrine and immunological changes was initiated by IL-1{beta}, the first responder of the stress and inflammatory responses. Our results have implications for finance because chronic stress and the immune response known as  sickness behaviour could have powerful effects on risk-taking and market stability.",

    "abstract": "Genome-scale models of metabolism (GEM) are used to study how metabolism varies in different physiological conditions. However, the great number of reactions involved in GEM makes it difficult to understand these variations. In order to have a more understandable tool, we developed a reduced metabolic model of central carbon and nitrogen metabolism, C2M2N with 77 reactions, 54 internal metabolites and 3 compartments, taking into account the actual stoichiometry of the reactions, including the stoichiometric role of the cofactors and the irreversibility of some reactions. In order to model OXPHOS functioning, the proton gradient through the inner mitochondrial membrane is represented by two pseudo-metabolites DPH ({Delta}pH) and DPSI ({Delta}{psi}).\n\nTo illustrate the interest of such a reduced and quantitative model of metabolism in mammalian cells, we used Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), to study all the possible fates of glutamine in metabolism. Our analysis shows that glutamine can supply carbon sources for cell energy production and can be used as carbon and nitrogen sources to synthesize essential metabolites. Finally, we studied the interplay between glucose and glutamine for the formation of cell biomass according to ammonia microenvironment. We then propose a quantitative analysis of the Warburg effect.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria frequently cooperate by sharing secreted metabolites such as enzymes and siderophores. The expression of different  public good traits can be interdependent, and studies on laboratory systems have shown that such trait linkage affects eco-evolutionary dynamics within bacterial communities. Here, we examine whether linkage among social traits occurs in natural Pseudomonas communities by examining investment levels and correlations between five public goods: biosurfactants, biofilm components, proteases, pyoverdines, and toxic compounds. Our phenotypic assays involving 315 isolates from soil and freshwater communities revealed that their social trait expression profiles varied dramatically, and that correlations between traits were frequent, exclusively positive, and sometimes habitat-specific. Our results indicate that Pseudomonas communities are dominated by isolates lying on a continuum between a  social type producing multiple public goods, and an  asocial type showing low investment into social traits. This segregation into different social types could reflect local adaptation to different microhabitats, or emerge from competition between different (social) strategies. Moreover, our results show that isolates with specialized trait repertoires are rare, suggesting limited scope for the mutual exchange of different public goods between isolates. Overall, our work indicates that complex interdependencies among social traits influence the evolution of microbial lifestyles in nature.",

Previous publicly available implementations of long-range phasing could not phase large datasets due to the computational cost of defining surrogate parents by exhaustive all-against-all searches. Further, both long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation were not designed to deal with large amounts of missing data, which is inherent when using multiple SNP arrays.\\n\\nMethodsHere, we developed methods which avoid the need for all-against-all searches by performing long-range phasing on subsets of individuals and then combing results. We also extended long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation algorithms to enable them to use different sets of markers, including missing values, when determining surrogate parents and identifying haplotypes. We implemented and tested these extensions in an updated version of our phasing software AlphaPhase.\\n\\nResultsA simulated dataset with one million individuals genotyped with the same set of 6,711 SNP for a single chromosome took two days to phase. A larger dataset with one million individuals genotyped with 49,579 SNP for a single chromosome took 14 days to phase. The percentage of correctly phased alleles at heterozygous loci was respectively 90.5% and 90.0% for the two datasets, which is comparable to the accuracy achieved with previous versions of AlphaPhase on smaller datasets.\\n\\nThe phasing accuracy for datasets with different sets of markers was generally lower than that for datasets with one set of markers. For a simulated dataset with three sets of markers 2.8% of alleles at heterozygous positions were phased incorrectly whereas the equivalent figure with one set of markers was 0.6%.\\n\\nConclusionsThe improved long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation algorithms enable AlphaPhase to quickly and accurately phase very large and heterogeneous datasets. This will enable more powerful breeding and genetics research and application.",

    "abstract": "Assessing the impact of variation in chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA (collectively termed the plasmotype) on plant phenotypes is challenging due to the difficulty in separating their effect from nuclear derived variation (the nucleotype). Haploid inducer lines can be used as efficient plasmotype donors to generate new plasmotype-nucleotype combinations (cybrids)(Ravi et al., 2014). We generated a panel comprising all possible cybrids of seven Arabidopsis thaliana accessions and extensively phenotyped these lines for 1859 phenotypes under stable and fluctuating conditions. We show that natural variation in the plasmotype results in additive as well as epistatic effects across all phenotypic categories. Plasmotypes which induce more additive phenotypic changes also cause more significant epistatic effects, suggesting a possible common basis for both additive and epistatic effects. On average epistatic interactions explained twice as much of the variance in phenotypes as additive plasmotype effects. The impact of plasmotypic variation was also more pronounced under fluctuating and stressful environmental conditions. Thus, the phenotypic impact of variation in plasmotypes is the outcome of multilevel Nucleotype X Plasmotype X Environment interactions and, as such, the plasmotype is likely to serve as a reservoir of variation which is only exposed under certain conditions. The production of cybrids using haploid inducers is a quick and precise method for assessing the phenotypic effects of natural variation in organellar genomes. It will facilitate efficient screening of unique nucleotype-plasmotype combinations to both improve our understanding of natural variation in nucleotype plasmotype interactions and identify favourable combinations to improve plant performance.",

    "abstract": "To understand what you are reading now, your mind retrieves the meanings of words and constructions from a linguistic knowledge store (lexico-semantic processing) and identifies the relationships among them to construct a complex meaning (syntactic or combinatorial processing). Do these two sets of processes rely on distinct, specialized mechanisms or, rather, share a common pool of resources? Linguistic theorizing, empirical evidence from language acquisition and processing, and computational modeling have jointly painted a picture whereby lexico-semantic and syntactic processing are deeply inter-connected and perhaps not separable. In contrast, many current proposals of the neural architecture of language continue to endorse a view whereby certain brain regions selectively support syntactic/combinatorial processing, although the locus of such \"syntactic hub\", and its nature, vary across proposals. Here, we searched for selectivity for syntactic over lexico-semantic processing using a powerful individual-subjects fMRI approach across three sentence comprehension paradigms that have been used in prior work to argue for such selectivity: responses to lexico-semantic vs. morpho-syntactic violations (Experiment 1); recovery from neural suppression across pairs of sentences differing in only lexical items vs. only syntactic structure (Experiment 2); and same/different meaning judgments on such sentence pairs (Experiment 3). Across experiments, both lexico-semantic and syntactic conditions elicited robust responses throughout the left fronto-temporal language network. Critically, however, no regions were more strongly engaged by syntactic than lexico-semantic processing, although some regions showed the opposite pattern. Thus, contra many current proposals of the neural architecture of language, syntactic/combinatorial processing is not separable from lexico-semantic processing at the level of brain regions--or even voxel subsets--within the language network, in line with strong integration between these two processes that has been consistently observed in behavioral and computational language research. The results further suggest that the language network may be generally more strongly concerned with meaning than syntactic form, in line with the primary function of language--to share meanings across minds.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous fluctuations underlying the brain activity can reflect the intrinsic organization of the system, such as the functional brain networks. In large scale, a network perspective has emerged as a new avenue to explore the functional properties of human brain. Here, we studied functional diversity in healthy subjects based on the network perspective. We hypothesized that the patterns of participation of different functional networks were related with the functional diversity of particular brain regions. Independent component analysis (ICA) was adopted to detect the intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) based on the data of resting-state functional MRI. An index of functional diversity (FD index) was proposed to quantitatively describe the degree of anisotropic distribution related with participation of various ICNs. We found that FD index continuously varied across the brain, for example, the primary motor cortex with low FD value and the precuneus with significantly high FD value. The FD values indicated the different functional roles of the corresponding brain regions, which were reflected by the various patterns of participation of ICNs. The FD index can be used as a new approach to quantitatively characterize the functional diversity of human brain, even for the changed functional properties caused by the psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Brain imaging with diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is sensitive to microstructural white matter changes associated with brain aging and neurodegeneration. In its third phase, the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI3) is collecting data across multiple sites and scanners using different dMRI acquisition protocols, to better understand disease effects. It is vital to understand when data can be pooled across scanners, and how the choice of dMRI protocol affects the sensitivity of extracted measures to differences in clinical impairment. Here, we analyzed ADNI3 data from 317 participants (mean age: 75.4{+/-}7.9 years; 143 men/174 women), who were each scanned at one of 47 sites with one of six dMRI protocols using scanners from three different manufacturers. We computed four standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) indices including fractional anisotropy (FADTI) and mean, radial, and axial diffusivity, and one FA index based on the tensor distribution function (FATDF), in 24 bilaterally averaged white matter regions of interest. We found that protocol differences significantly affected dMRI indices, in particular FADTI. We ranked the diffusion indices for their strength of association with four clinical assessments. In addition to diagnosis, we evaluated cognitive impairment as indexed by three commonly used screening tools for detecting dementia and Alzheimers disease: the Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum-of-boxes (CDR-sob). Using a nested random-effects model to account for protocol and site, we found that across all dMRI indices and clinical measures, the hippocampal-cingulum and fornix (crus) / stria terminalis regions most consistently showed strong associations with clinical impairment. Overall, the greatest effect sizes were detected in the hippocampal-cingulum and uncinate fasciculus for associations between axial or mean diffusivity and CDR-sob. FATDF detected robust widespread associations with clinical measures, while FADTI was the weakest of the five indices for detecting associations. Ultimately, we were able to successfully pool dMRI data from multiple acquisition protocols from ADNI3 and detect consistent and robust associations with clinical impairment and age.",

    "abstract": "While animal research has consistently reported preventive effects of exercise against drug abuse vulnerability, little is known about the influence of the developmental stage during which exercise is displayed on addictive drugs responsiveness. This study aimed to determine whether prenatal exercise could attenuate acute cocaine reactivity and psychomotor sensitization in youth offspring. We used a split-plot factorial design where C57BL/6J females were randomly assigned into sedentary or exercised (wheel-running) conditions before and during gestation, the wheels being removed on gestational day 18. Offspring were weaned, gendered and individually housed on 24-28 days old. At 38-42 days old, they were tested for their acute psychomotor responsiveness to 8 mg/kg cocaine and their initiation of sensitization over 8 additional once-daily administrations, the long-term expression of sensitization occurring 30 days later. Adolescent females born from exercised mothers were much less responsive to the acute psychomotor-stimulating effect of cocaine than those born from sedentary mothers (d = 0.75, p = .02), whereas there was no evidence for such a difference in males (d = 0.34, p = .17). However, we did not find sizeable attenuating effects of prenatal exercise on the initiation and the long-term expression of the psychomotor-activating effect of cocaine, in either sex (Cohens ds varying from -0.23 to 0.39). These results suggest that prenatal exercise may induce initial protection against cocaine responsiveness in youth females, a finding that warrants further research.",

    "abstract": "The regular firing pattern exhibited by medial entorhinal (mEC) grid cells of locomoting rodents is hypothesized to provide spatial metric information relevant for navigation. The development of virtual reality (VR) for head-fixed mice confers a number of experimental advantages and has become increasingly popular as a method for investigating spatially-selective cells. Recent experiments using 1D VR linear tracks have shown that some mEC cells have multiple fields in virtual space, analogous to grid cells on real linear tracks. We recorded from the mEC as mice traversed virtual tracks featuring regularly spaced repetitive cues and identified a population of cells with multiple firing fields, resembling the regular firing of grid cells. However, further analyses indicated that many of these were not, in fact, grid cells because: 1) When recorded in the open field they did not display discrete firing fields with six-fold symmetry; 2) In different VR environments their firing fields were found to match the spatial frequency of repetitive environmental cues. In contrast, cells identified as grid cells based on their open field firing patterns did not exhibit cue locking. In light of these results we highlight the importance of controlling the periodicity of the visual cues in VR and the necessity of identifying grid cells from real open field environments in order to correctly characterise spatially modulated neurons in VR experiments.",

However, causal filters can become biased by too high filter orders or uneven pass-bands. We explored the influence of different signal processing pipelines on the estimation of the optimal phase. This exploration involved performing two simulation studies. In the first, we simulated two different phase-dependencies (uni-versus bimodal) and sought to recover them with two distinct approaches that have previously been described. In the second, we specifically explored how filter parameters (e.g., order, pass-band) biased the phase estimation. On the basis of these findings, we propose using up-to-date toolboxes, re-running scripts after software updates and performing simulation studies in parallel to safeguard the analysis pipeline of empirical studies.",

We begin by detecting outliers in a single exposure-outcome MR analysis, hypothesising they are due to horizontal pleiotropy. We search across thousands of complete GWAS summary datasets in the MR-Base database to systematically identify other (\\\"candidate\\\") traits that associate with the outliers. We developed a multi-trait pleiotropy model of the heterogeneity in the exposure-outcome analysis due to pathways through candidate traits. Through detailed investigation of several causal relationships, many pleiotropic pathways were uncovered with already established causal effects, validating the approach, but also novel putative causal pathways. Adjustment for pleiotropic pathways reduced the heterogeneity across the analyses.",

    "abstract": "Examination of large-scale distributed networks within the individual reveals details of cortical network organization that are absent in group-averaged studies. One recent discovery is that a distributed transmodal network, often referred to as the  default network, is comprised of two separate but closely interdigitated networks, only one of which is coupled to posterior parahippocampal cortex. Not all studies of individuals have identified the same networks and questions remain about the degree to which the two networks are separate, particularly within regions hypothesized to be interconnected hubs. Here we replicate the observation of network separation across analytical (seed-based connectivity and parcellation) and data projection (volume and surface) methods in 2 individuals each scanned 31 times. Additionally, 3 individuals were examined with high-resolution fMRI to gain further insight into the anatomical details. The two networks were identified with separate regions localized to adjacent portions of the cortical ribbon, sometimes inside the same sulcus. Midline regions previously implicated as hubs revealed near complete spatial separation of the two networks, displaying a complex spatial topography in the posterior cingulate and precuneus. The network coupled to parahippocampal cortex also revealed a separate region directly within the hippocampus at or near the subiculum. These collective results support that the default network is composed of at least two spatially juxtaposed networks. Fine spatial details and juxta-positions of the two networks can be identified within individuals at high resolution, providing insight into the network organization of association cortex and placing further constraints on interpretation of group-averaged neuroimaging data.",

Totally, REs occur in 2012 genes during spermatogenesis, more than half of which harbor at two different sites of the same gene at least. We also found REs mainly occur in introns, coding regions (CDSs) and intergenic regions. Moreover, about half of the REs in CDSs can cause amino acids changes. Finally, based on our adult male Kunming mice, we verified that there is a non-synonymous A-to-I RNA editing site in Cog3 during spermatogenesis, which is conserved not only between species but also across tissues. In short, based on the power of integrating RNA-Seq datasets, we provided the landscape of REs and found their dynamic changes during mouse spermatogenesis.

Uncertainty lies at the core of this \"explore-exploit\" dilemma, for if all options were perfectly known, there would be no need to explore. Yet despite the prominent role of uncertainty-guided exploration in decision making, evidence for its neural implementation is still sparse. We investigated this question with model-based fMRI (n = 31) using a two-armed bandit task that independently manipulates two forms of uncertainty underlying different exploration strategies. The relative uncertainty between the two options was correlated with BOLD activity in right rostrolateral prefrontal cortex and drove directed exploration, a strategy that adds an uncertainty bonus to each option. The total uncertainty across the two options was correlated with activity in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and drove random exploration, a strategy that increases choice stochasticity in proportion to total uncertainty. The subjective estimates of uncertainty from both regions were predictive of subject choices. These results are consistent with a hybrid computational architecture in which different uncertainty computations are performed separately and then combined by downstream decision circuits to compute choice.",

Furthermore, the structural properties of a secondary auditory area in the left hemisphere, are capable to predict future song copying accuracy, already at the earliest stages of learning, before initiating vocal practicing.

We found that autaptic transmission represents the most powerful input of PV cells in neocortical Layer V. Autaptic strength was greater than synaptic strength onto PNs as result of a larger quantal size, whereas autaptic and heterosynaptic PV-PV synapses differed in the number of release sites. Overall, single-axon autaptic transmission contributed to ~40% of the total perisomatic inhibition that PV interneurons received. The strength of autaptic transmission modulated the coupling of PV-cell firing with optogenetically-induced {gamma}-oscillations preventing high frequency bursts of spikes. Autaptic self-inhibition represents an exceptionally large and fast disinhibitory mechanism to synchronize the output of PV cells during cognitive-relevant cortical network activity.",

    "abstract": "Microcomputed tomography (CT) is widely used for the study of mineralized tissues but a similar use for soft tissues is hindered by their low X-ray attenuation. This limitation can be overcome by the recent development of different staining techniques. Staining with Lugols solution, a mixture of one part iodine and two parts potassium iodide in water, stands out among these techniques for its low complexity and cost. Currently, Lugol staining is mostly used for anatomical examination of tissues. In the present study we seek to optimize the quality and reproducibility of the staining for ex vivo visualization of soft tissues in the context of a peripheral nerve regeneration model in the rat.\n\nWe show that the staining result not only depends on the concentration of the staining solution, but also on the amount of stain in relation to the tissue volume and composition, necessitating careful adaptation of the staining protocol to the respective specimen tissue. This optimization can be simplified by a stepwise staining which we show to yield a similar result compared to staining in a single step. Lugol staining solution results in concentration dependent tissue shrinkage which can be minimized but not eliminated. We compared the shrinkage of tendon, nerve, skeletal muscle, heart, brain and kidney with six iterations of Lugol staining.\n\n60 ml of 0.3% Lugols solution per cm3 of tissue for 24h yielded good results on the example of a peripheral nerve regeneration model and we were able to show that the regenerating nerve inside a silk fibroin tube can be visualized in 3D using this staining technique. This information helps in deciding the region of interest for histological imaging and provides a 3D context to histological findings. Correlating both imaging modalities has the potential to improve the understanding of the regenerative process.",

Depressed patients exhibit folate deficiencies, lower levels of hippocampal neurogenesis, elevated levels of homocysteine, and elevated levels of the stress hormone, cortisol, which may be inter-related. Here, we are interested in whether different doses of natural folate or synthetic folic acid diets can influence neurogenesis in the hippocampus, levels of plasma homocysteine, and serum corticosterone in adult female rats. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent dietary interventions for 29 days. Animals were randomly assigned to six different dietary groups: folate deficient + succinylsulfathiazole (SST), low 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), low 5-MTHF + (SST), high 5-MTHF + SST, low folic acid, and high folic acid. SST was added to a subset of the 5-MTHF diets to eliminate folic acid production in the gut. Before and after dietary treatment, blood samples were collected for corticosterone and homocysteine analysis, and brain tissue was collected for neurogenesis analysis. High folic acid and low 5-MTHF without SST increased the number of immature neurons (doublecortin-expressing cells) within the ventral hippocampus compared to folate deficient controls. Low 5-MTHF without SST significantly increased the number of immature neurons compared to low and high 5-MTHF + SST, indicating that SST interfered with elevations in neurogenesis. Low folic acid and high 5-MTHF+SST reduced plasma homocysteine levels compared to controls, but there was no significant effect of diet on serum corticosterone levels. Low folic acid and high 5-MTHF+SST reduced the number of mature new neurons in the ventral hippocampus (BrdU/NeuN-positive cells) compared to folate deficient controls. Overall, folic acid dose-dependently influenced neurogenesis, with low levels decreasing but high levels increasing, neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus, suggesting this region, which is important for regulating stress, is particularly sensitive to folic acid in diets. Furthermore, the addition of SST negated the effects of 5-MTHF to increase neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Transformation of an indolent B-cell lymphoma is associated with a more aggressive clinical course and poor survival. The role of immune surveillance in the transformation of a B-cell indolent lymphoma towards a more aggressive form is poorly documented. To experimentally address this question, we used the L.CD40 mouse model, which is characterized by B-cell specific continuous CD40 signaling, responsible for spleen indolent clonal or oligoclonal B-cell lymphoma after one year in 60% cases. Immunosuppression was obtained either by T/NK cell depletion or by treatment with the T-cell immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. Immunosuppressed L.CD40 mice had larger splenomegaly with increased numbers of B-cells in both spleen and peripheral blood. High-throughput sequencing of immunoglobulin variable segments revealed that clonal expansion was increased in immunosuppressed L.CD40 mice. Tumor B cells of immunosuppressed mice were larger with an immunoblastic aspect, both on blood smears and spleen tissue sections, with increased proliferation rate and increased numbers of activated B-cells. Collectively, these features suggest that immune suppression induced a shift from indolent lymphomas into aggressive ones. Thus, as a preclinical model, immunosuppressed L.CD40 mice reproduce aggressive transformation of an indolent B-cell tumor and highlight the role of the immune surveillance in its clinical course, opening new perspective for immune restoration therapies.\\n\\nSummary statementHighlighting the role of immune surveillance, transformation of indolent B-cell lymphoma into an aggressive malignancy is experimentally reproduced after T-cell immune suppression in the L.CD40 preclinical mouse model.",

    "abstract": "mRNA translation is a key step in decoding genetic information. Genetic decoding is surprisingly heterogeneous, as multiple distinct polypeptides can be synthesized from a single mRNA sequence. To study translational heterogeneity, we developed the MoonTag, a new fluorescence labeling system to visualize translation of single mRNAs. When combined with the orthogonal SunTag system, the MoonTag enables dual readouts of translation, greatly expanding the possibilities to interrogate complex translational heterogeneity. By placing MoonTag and SunTag sequences in different translation reading frames, each driven by distinct translation start sites, start site selection of individual ribosomes can be visualized in real-time. We find that start site selection is largely stochastic, but that the probability of using a particular start site differs among mRNA molecules, and can be dynamically regulated over time. Together, this study provides key insights into translation start site selection heterogeneity, and provides a powerful toolbox to visualize complex translation dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear transport is facilitated by the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) and is essential for life in eukaryotes. The NPC is a long-lived and exceptionally large structure. We asked whether NPC function is compromised in ageing mitotic cells. By imaging of single yeast cells during ageing, we show that the abundance of several NPC components and NPC assembly factors decreases while signs of misassembled NPCs appear. Consequently, nuclear permeability decreases, resulting in decreased dynamics of transcription factor shuttling and increased nuclear compartmentalisation. In support that declining NPC quality control is important in mitotic ageing, we find that the transport kinetics observed in ageing is mimicked in an NPC assembly mutant. Additionally, the single cell life histories reveal that cells that better maintain NPC function are longer lived. We conclude that assembly and quality control of NPCs are major challenges for ageing mitotic cells.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of E-cadherin at the plasma membrane by endocytosis is of vital importance for developmental and disease. p120-catenin, which binds to the E-cadherin C-terminus, can both promote and inhibit E-cadherin endocytosis. However, little is known about what determines the directionality of p120-catenin activity, and the molecules downstream. Here, we have discovered that p120-catenin fine-tunes the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of E-cadherin in Drosophila embryonic epidermal cells. It simultaneously activated two actin-remodelling pathways with opposing effects: RhoA, which stabilized E-cadherin at the membrane, and Arf1, which promoted internalization. Epistasis experiments revealed that RhoA additionally inhibited Arf1. E-cadherin was efficiently endocytosed only in the presence of intermediate p120-catenin amounts with too little and too much p120-catenin inhibiting E-cadherin endocytosis. Finally, we found that p120-catenin levels altered the tension of the plasma membrane. Altogether, this shows that p120-catenin is a central hub which co-ordinates cell adhesion, endocytosis, and actin dynamics with tissue tension.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBlood-based methods using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are under development as an alternative to existing screening tests. However, early-stage detection of cancer using tumor-derived cfDNA has proven challenging because of the small proportion of cfDNA derived from tumor tissue in early-stage disease. A machine learning approach to discover signatures in cfDNA, potentially reflective of both tumor and non-tumor contributions, may represent a promising direction for the early detection of cancer.\\n\\nMethodsWhole-genome sequencing was performed on cfDNA extracted from plasma samples (N=546 colorectal cancer and 271 non-cancer controls). Reads aligning to protein-coding gene bodies were extracted, and read counts were normalized. cfDNA tumor fraction was estimated using IchorCNA. Machine learning models were trained using k-fold cross-validation and confounder-based cross-validation to assess generalization performance.\\n\\nResultsIn a colorectal cancer cohort heavily weighted towards early-stage cancer (80% stage I/II), we achieved a mean AUC of 0.92 (95% CI 0.91-0.93) with a mean sensitivity of 85% (95% CI 83-86%) at 85% specificity. Sensitivity generally increased with tumor stage and increasing tumor fraction. Stratification by age, sequencing batch, and institution demonstrated the impact of these confounders and provided a more accurate assessment of generalization performance.\\n\\nConclusionsA machine learning approach using cfDNA achieved high sensitivity and specificity in a large, predominantly early-stage, colorectal cancer cohort. The possibility of systematic technical and institution-specific biases warrants similar confounder analyses in other studies. Prospective validation of this machine learning method and evaluation of a multi-analyte approach are underway.",

EOMES+ SSCs have a lower proliferation index than EOMES- GFRA1+ spermatogonia in wild-type but not in Plzflu/lu mice. This comparison demonstrates that PLZF regulates their proliferative activity and suggests that EOMES+ SSCs are lost through proliferative exhaustion in Plzflu/lu mice.

    "abstract": "The olive fruit fly or olive fly (Bactrocera oleae) is the most important pest of cultivated olive trees. Like all insects the olive fly undergoes complete metamorphosis. However, the transcription dynamics that occur during early embryonic development have not been explored, while detailed transcriptomic analysis in the absence of a fully annotated genome is challenging. We collected olive fly embryos at hourly intervals for the first 6 hours of development and performed full-length cDNA-Seq using a purpose designed SMARTer cDNA synthesis protocol followed by sequencing on the MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). We generated 31 million total reads across the timepoints (median yield 4.2 million per timepoint). The reads showed 98 % alignment rate to the olive fly genome and 91 % alignment rate to the NBCI predicted B. oleae gene models. Over 50 % of the expressed genes had at least one read covering its entire length validating our full-length RNA-Seq procedure. Expression of 68 % of the predicted B. oleae genes was detected in the first six hours of development. We generated a de novo transcriptome assembly of the olive fly and identified 3553 novel genes and a total of 79,810 transcripts; a fourfold increase in transcriptome diversity compared to the NCBI predicted transcriptome. On a global scale, the first six hours of embryo development were characterized by dramatic transcriptome changes with the total number of transcripts per embryo dropping to half from the first hour to the second hour of embryo development. Clustering of genes based on temporal co-expression followed by gene-set enrichment analysiss of genes expressed in the first six hours of embryo development showed that genes involved in transcription and translation, macro-molecule biosynthesis, and neurodevelopment were highly enriched. These data provide the first insight into the transcriptome landscape of the developing olive fly embryo. The data also reveal transcript signatures of sex development. Overall, full-length sequencing of the cDNA molecules permitted a detailed characterization of the isoform complexity and the transcriptional dynamics of the first embryonic stages of the B. oleae.",

We further provide a combination of protein localisation and phenotypic evidence in chick, humans, mice and fish that Netrin-1 has an evolutionarily conserved and essential requirement for OFC, and is likely to have a major role in palate fusion.

Embryonic testicular regression syndrome (ETRS; MIM: 273250) is considered part of the clinical spectrum of 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. Most ETRS patients present micropenis or atypical genitalia associated with a complete absence of gonadal tissue in one or both sides. In most patients with gonadal dysgenesis, the genetic diagnosis is unclear. We performed whole exome sequencing in ETRS patients and identified a rare variant, the p.Arg308Gln, in DEAH (Asp-Glu-Ala-His) box polypeptide 37 (DHX37) in 5 affected individuals from three unrelated families. We expanded the analysis of DHX37 coding region to additional 71 patients with 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis and identified the p.Arg308Gln and three other DHX37 missense variants (p.Arg151Trp, p.Thr304Met and p.Arg674Trp) in 11 affected members from eight distinct families (8 patients with ETRS, two with partial gonadal dysgenesis and one 46,XY DSD female patient previously gonadectomized). The p.Arg308Gln and p.Arg674Trp recurrent variants were identified in six and three families, respectively.

    "abstract": "The genetic code is necessarily degenerate with 64 possible nucleotide triplets being translated into 20 amino acids. 18 out of the 20 amino acids are encoded by multiple synonymous codons. While synonymous codons are clearly equivalent in terms of the information they carry, it is now well established that they are used in a biased fashion. There is currently no consensus as to the origin of this bias. Drawing on ideas from stochastic thermodynamics we derive from first principles a mathematical model describing the statistics of codon usage bias. We show that the model accurately describes the distribution of codon usage bias of genomes in the fungal and bacterial kingdoms. Based on it, we derive a new computational measure of codon usage bias -- the distance [Formula] capturing two aspects of codon usage bias: (i) Differences in the genome-wide frequency of codons and (ii) apparent non-random distributions of codons across mRNAs. By means of large scale computational analysis of over 900 species across 2 kingdoms of life, we demonstrate that our measure provides novel biological insights. Specifically, we show that while codon usage bias is clearly based on heritable traits and closely related species show similar degrees of bias, there is considerable variation in the magnitude of [Formula] within taxonomic classes suggesting that the contribution of sequence-level selection to codon bias varies substantially within relatively confined taxonomic groups. Interestingly, commonly used model organisms are near the median for values of [Formula] for their taxonomic class, suggesting that they may not be good representative models for species with more extreme [Formula], which comprise organisms of medical an agricultural interest. We also demonstrate that amino acid specific patterns of codon usage are themselves quite variable between branches of the tree of life, and that some of this variability correlates with organismal tRNA content.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic modifications can maintain or alter the inherent symmetry of the nucleosome however the mechanisms that deposit and/or propagate symmetry or asymmetry are not understood. Here we report that yeast Set1C/COMPASS is dimeric and consequently symmetrically trimethylates histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) on promoter nucleosomes. Mutation of the dimer interface to make Set1C monomeric abolished H3K4me3 on most promoters. The most active promoters, particularly those involved in the oxidative phase of the yeast metabolic cycle, displayed H3K4me2, which is normally excluded from active promoters, and a subset of these also displayed H3K4me3. In wild-type yeast, deletion of the sole H3K4 demethylase, Jhd2, has no effect. However in monomeric Set1C yeast, Jhd2 deletion increased H3K4me3 levels on the H3K4me2 promoters. Notably, the association of Set1C with the elongating polymerase was not perturbed by monomerisation. These results imply that symmetrical H3K4 methylation is an embedded consequence of Set1C dimerism and that Jhd2 demethylates asymmetric H3K4me3. Consequently, rather than methylation and demethylation acting in opposition as logic would suggest, a dimeric methyltransferase and monomeric demethylase co-operate to eliminate asymmetry and focus symmetrical H3K4me3 onto selected nucleosomes. This presents a new paradigm for the establishment of epigenetic detail.",

    "abstract": "To quantitatively understand biological processes that occur over many hours or days, it is desirable to image multiple samples simultaneously and automatically process and analyze the resulting datasets. Here, we present a complete multi-sample preparation, imaging, processing, and analysis workflow to determine the development of the vascular volume in zebrafish. Up to five live embryos were mounted and imaged simultaneously over several days using selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM). The resulting large imagery dataset of several terabytes was processed in an automated manner on a high-performance computer cluster and segmented with a novel segmentation approach that uses images of red blood cells as training data. This analysis yielded a precise quantification of growth characteristics of the whole vascular network, head vasculature, and tail vasculature over development. Our multi-sample platform demonstrates effective upgrades to conventional single-sample imaging platforms and paves the way for diverse quantitative long-term imaging studies.\\n\\nSummary statementWe present a dedicated multi-sample light sheet imaging, processing and analysis platform and demonstrate its value for studies of vascular growth in zebrafish.",
