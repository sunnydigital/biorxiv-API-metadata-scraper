    "abstract": "A wealth of transcriptomic and clinical data on solid tumours are under-utilized due to unharmonized data storage and format. We have developed the MetaGxData package compendium, which includes manually-curated and standardized clinical, pathological, survival, and treatment metadata across breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer data. MetaGxData is the largest compendium of curated transcriptomic data for these cancer types to date, spanning 86 datasets and encompassing 15,249 samples. Open access to standardized metadata across cancer types promotes use of their transcriptomic and clinical data in a variety of cross-tumour analyses, including identification of common biomarkers, establishing common patterns of co-expression networks, and assessing the validity of prognostic signatures. Here, we demonstrate that MetaGxData is a flexible framework that facilitates meta-analyses by using it to identify common prognostic genes in ovarian and breast cancer. Furthermore, we use the data compendium to create the first gene signature that is prognostic in a meta-analysis across 3 cancers. These findings demonstrate the potential of MetaGxData to serve as an important resource in oncology research and provide a foundation for future development of cancer-specific compendia.",

    "abstract": "K-Ras is the most frequently mutated oncoprotein in human cancers, and G12D is its most prevalent mutation. To understand how G12D mutation impacts K-Ras function, we need to understand how it alters the regulation of its dynamics. Here, we present local changes in K-Ras structure, conformation and dynamics upon G12D mutation, from long-timescale Molecular Dynamics simulations of active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) forms of wild-type and mutant K-Ras, with an integrated investigation of atomistic-level changes, local conformational shifts and correlated residue motions. Our results reveal that the local changes in K-Ras are specific to bound nucleotide (GTP or GDP), and we provide a structural basis for this. Specifically, we show that G12D mutation causes a shift in the population of local conformational states of K-Ras, especially in Switch-II (SII) and 3-helix regions, in favor of a conformation that is associated with a catalytically impaired state through structural changes; it also causes SII motions to anti-correlate with other regions. This detailed picture of G12D mutation effects on the local dynamic characteristics of both active and inactive protein helps enhance our understanding of local K-Ras dynamics, and can inform studies on the development of direct inhibitors towards the treatment of K-RasG12D-driven cancers.",

    "abstract": "Using genome-wide mutant fitness assays in diverse bacteria, we identified novel oxidative pathways for the catabolism of 2-deoxy-D-ribose and 2-deoxy-D-ribonate. We propose that deoxyribose is oxidized to deoxyribonate, oxidized to ketodeoxyribonate, and cleaved to acetyl-CoA and glyceryl-CoA. We have genetic evidence for this pathway in three genera of bacteria, and we confirmed the oxidation of deoxyribose to ketodeoxyribonate in vitro. In Pseudomonas simiae, the expression of enzymes in the pathway is induced by deoxyribose or deoxyribonate, while in Paraburkholderia bryophila and in Burkholderia phytofirmans, the pathway proceeds in parallel with the known deoxyribose 5-phosphate aldolase pathway. We identified another oxidative pathway for the catabolism of deoxyribonate, with acyl-CoA intermediates, in Klebsiella michiganensis. Of these four bacteria, only P. simiae relies entirely on an oxidative pathway to consume deoxyribose. The deoxyribose dehydrogenase of P. simiae is either non-specific or evolved recently, as this enzyme is very similar to a novel vanillin dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida that we identified. So, we propose that these oxidative pathways evolved primarily to consume deoxyribonate, which is a waste product of metabolism.\\n\\nImportanceDeoxyribose is one of the building blocks of DNA and is released when cells die and their DNA degrades. We identified a bacterium that can grow with deoxyribose as its sole source of carbon even though its genome does not encode any of the known genes for breaking down deoxyribose. By growing many mutants of this bacterium together on deoxyribose and using DNA sequencing to measure the change in the mutants abundance, we identified multiple protein-coding genes that are required for growth on deoxyribose. Based on the similarity of these proteins to enzymes of known function, we propose a 6-step pathway in which deoxyribose is oxidized and then cleaved. Diverse bacteria use a portion of this pathway to break down a related compound, deoxyribonate, which is a waste product of human metabolism and is present in urine. Our study illustrates the utility of large-scale bacterial genetics to identify previously unknown metabolic pathways.",

We developed an automated training platform called the  Educage, which was used to train mice on a go/no-go auditory discrimination task to their perceptual limits, for difficult discriminations among pure tones or natural sounds. Spiking responses of excitatory and inhibitory L2/3 neurons in mouse A1 revealed learning-induced overrepresentation of the learned frequencies, in accordance with previous literature. Using a novel computational model to study auditory tuning curves we show that overrepresentation does not necessarily improve discrimination performance of the network to the learned tones. In contrast, perceptual learning of natural sounds induced  sparsening and decorrelation of the neural response, and consequently improving discrimination of these complex sounds. The signature of plasticity in A1 highlights its central role in coding natural sounds as compared to pure tones.",

    "abstract": "Evaluation of chilling requirements (CR) of cultivars of temperate fruit trees provides key information to assess regional suitability, according to winter chill, for both industry expansion and ongoing profitability as climate change continues. Traditional methods for calculating CR use climate controlled chambers and define CR using a fixed budburst percentage, usually close to 50% (CR-50%), without considering the productivity level associated to this percentage. This CR-50% definition may underestimate the real CR of tree crops for optimal productivity. This underestimation is particularly important to consider as winter chill accumulation is declining in many regions due to climate change. In this work we used sweet cherry to analyse the traditional method for calculating CR in many Rosaceae species (CR-50%) and compared the results with more a restrictive, productivity focused method, with CR defined with a 90% bud break level (90%, CRm-90%) close to the optimal budburst which assures productivity. Climate projections of winter chill suitability across Europe using CR-50% and CRm-90% were calculated. Regional suitability landscape was highly dependent on the method used to define CR and differences were found for a wide area of the European geography, both cold and mild winter areas. Our results suggest a need to use an optimal budburst level for the assessment of CR for sweet cherry. The use of traditional methods to determine CR can result in an underestimation of productivity CR with negative consequences for the fruit industry, particularly as climate change advances.",

IGE have been detected using polygenic models in multiple species, including laboratory mice and humans. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Genome-wide association studies of IGE (igeGWAS) can point to IGE genes, but have not yet been applied to non-familial IGE arising from \"peers\" and affecting biomedical phenotypes. In addition, the extent to which igeGWAS will identify loci not identified by dgeGWAS remains an open question. Finally, findings from igeGWAS have not been confirmed by experimental manipulation.\n\nWe leveraged a dataset of 170 behavioural, physiological and morphological phenotypes measured in 1,812 genetically heterogeneous laboratory mice to study IGE arising between same-sex, adult, unrelated laboratory mice housed in the same cage. We developed methods for igeGWAS in this context and identified 24 significant IGE loci for 17 phenotypes (FDR < 10%). There was no overlap between IGE loci and DGE loci for the same phenotype, which was consistent with the moderate genetic correlations between DGE and IGE for the same phenotype estimated using polygenic models. Finally, we fine-mapped seven significant IGE loci to individual genes and confirmed, in an experiment with a knockout model, that Epha4 gives rise to IGE on stress-coping strategy and wound healing.\n\nOur results demonstrate the potential for igeGWAS to identify IGE genes and shed some light into the mechanisms of peer influence.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReinforcement learning models provide excellent descriptions of learning in multiple species across a variety of tasks. Many researchers are interested in relating parameters of reinforcement learning models to neural measures, psychological variables or experimental manipulations. We demonstrate that parameter identification is difficult because a range of parameter values provide approximately equal quality fits to data. This identification problem has a large impact on power: we show that a researcher who wants to detect a medium sized correlation (r = .3) with 80% power between a variable and learning rate must collect 60% more subjects than specified by a typical power analysis in order to account for the noise introduced by model fitting.\\n\\nNew MethodWe derive a Bayesian optimal model fitting technique that takes advantage of information contained in choices and reaction times to constrain parameter estimates.\\n\\nResultsWe show using simulation and empirical data that this method substantially improves the ability to recover learning rates.\\n\\nComparison with Existing MethodsWe compare this method against the use of Bayesian priors. We show in simulations that the combined use of Bayesian priors and reaction times confers the highest parameter identifiability. However, in real data where the priors may have been misspecified, the use of Bayesian priors interferes with the ability of reaction time data to improve parameter identifiability.\\n\\nConclusionsWe present a simple technique that takes advantage of readily available data to substantially improve the quality of inferences that can be drawn from parameters of reinforcement learning models.\\n\\nHighlights- Parameters of reinforcement learning models are particularly difficult to estimate\\n- Incorporating reaction times into model fitting improves parameter identifiability\\n- Bayesian weighting of choice and reaction times improves the power of analyses assessing learning rate",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWA growing number of experimental and theoretical studies show the importance of partner choice as a mechanism to promote the evolution of cooperation, especially in humans. In this paper, we focus on the question of the precise quantitative level of cooperation that should evolve under this mechanism. When individuals compete to be chosen by others, their level of investment in cooperation evolves towards higher values, a process called competitive altruism, or runaway cooperation. Using a classic adaptive dynamics model, we first show that, when the cost of changing partner is low, this runaway process can lead to a profitless escalation of cooperation. In the extreme, when partner choice is entirely frictionless, cooperation even increases up to a level where its cost entirely cancels out its benefit. That is, at evolutionary equilibrium, individuals gain the same payoff than if they had not cooperated at all. Second, importing models from matching theory in economics we, however, show that, when individuals can plastically modulate their choosiness in function of their own cooperation level, partner choice stops being a runaway competition to outbid others, and becomes a competition to form the most optimal partnerships. In this case, when the cost of changing partner tends toward zero partner choice leads to the evolution of the socially optimum level of cooperation. This last result could explain the observation that human cooperation seems to be often constrained by considerations of social efficiency.",

In this study, a comparison of the similarities and differences in the 44 publicly available sequences of IncHI plasmids from Enterobacteriaceae (1961-2013), revealed extensive conservation of their coding sequences. However, each genome had accessory regions with features of degradation or resistance to antibacterial agents. This article elucidates the IncHI1, IncHI2 and IncHI3 subgroup plasmids from the evolutive line based on multiple drug-resistant modules, explains the origin of the IncHI1 pAKU1-like composite transposon lineage, typifies the subgroup IncHI3, which is distantly related to IncHI1 and IncHI2 in phylogenetic analyses, confirms the relations within the transfer regions of H-group plasmids, and points to the divergence time of evolution with phylogenetic trees. Homology between subgroups, as measured by the molecular clock test, indicated that the contemporary IncHI1 and IncHI2 transfer region lineages diverged from an ancestral clone approximately 8,000 years ago (17,000 years ago if the divergent IncHI3 plasmids are included), although the IncH backbone was older. The uniformity of the composite transposon shared by most IncHI1 subgroup plasmids might be functionally equivalent to the heavy metal resistance that is mediated by some operons in the IncHI2 subgroup plasmids. A comparison of the DNA among these closely related plasmids provided insights on the horizontal and vertical transfers that were involved in their development.",

Short-read viral metagenomic studies have provided clues to viral function and first estimates of global viral gene abundance and distribution. However, short-read assemblies are confounded by populations with high levels of strain evenness and nucleotide diversity (microdiversity), limiting assembly of some of the most abundant viruses on Earth. Assembly across genomic islands which likely contain niche-defining genes that drive ecological speciation is also challenging. While such populations and features are successfully captured by single-virus genomics and fosmid-based approaches, both techniques require considerable cost and technical expertise. Here we established a low-cost, low-input, high throughput alternative method for improving assembly of viral metagenomics using long read technology. Named  VirION (Viral, long-read metagenomics via MinION sequencing), our sequencing approach and complementary bioinformatics pipeline (i) increased number and completeness of assembled viral genomes compared to short-read sequencing methods; (ii) captured populations of abundant viruses with high microdiversity missed by short-read methods and (iii) captured more and longer genomic islands than short-read methods. Thus, VirION provides a high throughput and cost-effective alternative to fosmid and single-virus genomic approaches to more comprehensively explore viral communities in nature.",

    "abstract": "Protein tyrosine nitration is a hallmark of oxidative stress related disease states, commonly detected as anti-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity. The precise reactive oxygen sources, mechanisms of nitration as well as the modified target proteins and functional consequences, however, remain often unclear. Here we explore protein tyrosine nitration under basal conditions and find surprisingly physiologically nitrated proteins. Upon purifying a prominent physiologically nitrotyrosine immunopositive in hearts from mouse, rat and pig, we identify it as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Mechanistically, LDHs degree of basal nitration depended on two canonical sources, NO synthase (NOS) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), respectively. When validating the nitrated amino acid by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we, surprisingly, located LDH nitration not to a tyrosine but the C-terminal tryptophan, Trp324. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that Trp324 nitration restricts the interaction of the active site loop with the C-terminal -helix essential for activity. This prediction was confirmed by enzyme kinetics revealing an apparent lower Vmax of nitrated LDH, although yet unidentified concurrent oxidative modifications may contribute. Protein nitration is, thus, not a by definition disease marker but reflects also physiological signaling by eNOS/NO, MPO/nitrite and possibly other pathways. The commonly used assay of anti-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity is apparently cross-reactive to nitrotryptophan requiring a reevaluation of the protein nitration literature. In the case of LDH, nitration of Trp324 is aggravated under cardiac metabolic stress conditions and functionally limits maximal enzyme activity. Trp324-nitrated LDH may serve both as a previously not recognized disease biomarker and possibly mechanistic lead to understand the metabolic changes under these conditions.",

Disclosure of trial results completed by biopharmaceutical industry and non-industry sponsors of at least 30 trials (2006-2015) was assessed using TrialsTracker.\\n\\nFindingsAmong the top 50 companies, 30 were EFPIA/PhRMA members and 20 were non-members, of which 26 and none, respectively, had a statement on their website committing to the disclosure of trials data. Of 29 377 trials in TrialsTracker, 9511 were industry-sponsored (69 companies) and 19 866 were non-industry-sponsored (254 institutions). The overall mean disclosure rate was 55%, with higher rates for industry (74%) than for non-industry sponsors (46%). Of the 30 companies within the top 50 with data in TrialsTracker, the mean disclosure rate was 76% (77% for EFPIA/PhRMA members [n = 25] versus 67% for non-members [n = 5]).\\n\\nConclusionsMost of the top 50 biopharmaceutical companies have publicly committed to the disclosure of trial data. Industry sponsors have responded to the ethical and legal demands of trial disclosure to a greater extent than non-industry sponsors, and now disclose three quarters of their trials.",

    "abstract": "Studies have demonstrated that pervasive gene tree conflict underlies several important phylogenetic relationships where different species tree methods produce conflicting results. Here, we present a means of dissecting the phylogenetic signal for alternative resolutions within a dataset in order to resolve recalcitrant relationships and, importantly, identify what the dataset is unable to resolve. These procedures extend upon methods for isolating conflict and concordance involving specific candidate relationships and can be used to identify systematic error and disambiguate sources of conflict among species tree inference methods. We demonstrate these on a large phylogenomic plant dataset. Our results support the placement of Amborella as sister to the remaining extant angiosperms, Gnetales as sister to pines, and the monophyly of extant gymnosperms. Several other contentious relationships, including the resolution of relationships within the bryophytes and the eudicots, remain uncertain given the low number of supporting gene trees. To address whether concatenation of filtered genes amplified phylogenetic signal for relationships, we implemented a combinatorial heuristic to test combinability of genes. We found that nested conflicts limited the ability of data filtering methods to fully ameliorate conflicting signal amongst gene trees. These analyses confirmed that the underlying conflicting signal does not support broad concatenation of genes. Our approach provides a means of dissecting a specific dataset to address deep phylogenetic relationships while also identifying the inferential boundaries of the dataset.",

    "abstract": "Due to the low density of envelope (Env) spikes on the surface of HIV-1, neutralizing IgG antibodies rarely bind bivalently using both antigen-binding arms (Fabs) to crosslink between spikes (inter-spike crosslinking), instead resorting to weaker monovalent binding that is more sensitive to Env mutations. Synthetic antibodies designed to bivalently bind a single Env trimer (intra-spike crosslinking) were previously shown to exhibit increased neutralization potencies. In initial work, diFabs joined by varying lengths of rigid double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were considered. Anticipating future experiments to improve synthetic antibodies, we investigate whether linkers with different rigidities could enhance diFab potency by modeling DNA-Fabs containing different combinations of rigid dsDNA and flexible single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and characterizing their neutralization potential. Model predictions suggest that while a long flexible polymer may be capable of bivalent binding, it exhibits weak neutralization due to the large loss in entropic degrees of freedom when both Fabs are bound. In contrast, the strongest neutralization potencies are predicted to require a rigid linker that optimally spans the distance between two Fab binding sites on an Env trimer, and avidity can be further boosted by incorporating more Fabs into these constructs. These results inform the design of multivalent anti-HIV-1 therapeutics that utilize avidity effects to remain potent against HIV-1 in the face of the rapid mutation of Env spikes.\\n\\nSignificanceIgG antibodies utilize avidity to increase their apparent affinities through simultaneous binding of two antigen-binding Fabs - if one Fab dissociates from an antigen, the other Fab can remain attached, allowing rebinding. HIV-1 foils this strategy by having few, and highly-separated, Envelope spike targets for antibodies, forcing most IgGs to bind monovalently. Here we develop a statistical mechanics model of synthetic diFabs joined by DNA linkers of different lengths and flexibilities. This framework enables us to translate the energetic and entropic effects of the linker into the neutralization potency of a diFab. We demonstrate that the avidity of multivalent binding is enhanced by using rigid linkers or including additional Fabs capable of simultaneous binding, providing the means to quantitatively predict the potencies of other antibody designs.",

To investigate this divergence we compared the transcriptomes of genetically paired ICM and trophectoderm (TE) samples with three hESC lines: MAN1, HUES3 and HUES7 at similar passage. We generated inferred interactome networks using transcriptomic data unique to the ICM or TE, and defined a hierarchy of modules (highly connected regions with shared function). We compared network properties and the modular hierarchy and show that the three hESCs had limited overlap with ICM specific transcriptome (6%-12%). However this overlap was enriched for network properties related to transcriptional activity in ICM (p=0.016); greatest in MAN1 compared to HUES3 (p=0.048) or HUES7 (p=0.012). The hierarchy of modules in the ICM interactome contained a greater proportion of MAN1 specific gene expression (46%) compared to HUES3 (28%) and HUES7 (25%) (p=9.0x10-4).\n\nThese findings show that traditional methods based on transcriptome overlap are not sufficient to identify divergence of hESCs from ICM.

    "abstract": "BackgroundImprinted genes are epigenetically modified during gametogenesis and maintain the established epigenetic signatures after fertilization, causing parental-specific gene expression.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we show that imprinted paternally-expressed genes (PEGs) in the Arabidopsis endosperm are marked by an epigenetic signature of Polycomb Repressive Complex2 (PRC2)-mediated H3K27me3 together with heterochromatic H3K9me2 and CHG methylation, which specifically mark the silenced maternal alleles of PEGs. The co-occurrence of H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 on defined loci in the endosperm drastically differs from the strict separation of both pathways in vegetative tissues, revealing tissue-specific employment of repressive epigenetic pathways in plants. Based on the presence of this epigenetic signature on maternal alleles we were able to predict known PEGs at high accuracy and identified several new PEGs that we confirmed using INTACT-based transcriptomes generated in this study.\\n\\nConclusionsThe presence of the three repressive epigenetic marks, H3K27me3, H3K9me2, and CHG methylation on the maternal alleles in the endosperm serves as a specific epigenetic signature that allows to predict genes with parental-specific gene expression. Our study reveals that there are substantially more PEGs than previously identified, indicating that paternal-specific gene expression is of higher functional relevance than currently estimated. The combined activity of PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 together with the heterochromatic H3K9me3 has also been reported to silence the maternal Xist locus in mammalian preimplantation embryos, suggesting convergent employment of both pathways during the evolution of genomic imprinting.",

However, new mathematical and computational methods are required to represent and analyze gene expression changes that occur in complex mixtures of single cells as they respond to signals, drugs, or disease states. Here, we introduce a mathematical modeling platform, PopAlign, that automatically identifies subpopulations of cells within a heterogeneous mixture, and tracks gene expression and cell abundance changes across subpopulations by constructing and comparing probabilistic models. Probabilistic models provide a low-error, compressed representation of single cell data that enables efficient large-scale computations. We apply PopAlign to analyze the impact of 40 different immunomodulatory compounds on a heterogeneous population of donor-derived human immune cells as well as patient-specific disease signatures in multiple myeloma. PopAlign scales to comparisons involving tens to hundreds of samples, enabling large-scale studies of natural and engineered cell populations as they respond to drugs, signals or physiological change.",

    "abstract": "The endogenous metabolite methylglyoxal (MGO) has recently emerged as a potential mediator of psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression, but its precise mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Here, we find that MGO concentrations are decreased in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in rats subjected to chronic stress, and low-dose MGO treatment remarkedly enhances resilience to stress and alleviates depression-like symptoms. This effect is achieved by MGOs promotion on the synaptic plasticity in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments show that MGO provokes the dimerization and autophosphorylation of TrkB and the subsequent activation of downstream Akt/CREB signaling, which leads to a rapid and sustained expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We further demonstrate that MGO directly binds to the extracellular domain of TrkB, but not its intracellular domain. In addition, we also identify a natural product luteolin and its derivative lutD as potent inhibitors of Glyoxalase 1 and validate their antidepressant effects in chronic stress rat models. The antidepressant role of endogenous MGO provides a new basis for the understanding and therapeutic intervention design for stress-associated mental disorders.",

    "abstract": "The process of speciation involves whole genome differentiation by overcoming gene flow between diverging populations. We have ample knowledge which evolutionary forces may cause genomic differentiation, and several speciation models have been proposed to explain the transition from genetic to genomic differentiation. However, it is still unclear what are critical conditions enabling genomic differentiation in nature. The Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, is observed as two sympatric strains that have different host-plant ranges, suggesting the possibility of ecological divergent selection. In our previous study, we observed that these two strains show genetic differentiation across the whole genome with an unprecedentedly low extent, suggesting the possibility that whole genome sequences started to be differentiated between the strains. In this study, we analyzed whole genome sequences from these two strains from Mississippi to identify critical evolutionary factors for genomic differentiation. The genomic Fst is low (0.017) while 91.3% of 10kb windows have Fst greater than 0, suggesting genome-wide differentiation with a low extent. We identified nearly 400 outliers of genetic differentiation between strains, and found that physical linkage among these outliers is not a primary cause of genomic differentiation. Fst is not significantly correlated with gene density, a proxy for the strength of selection, suggesting that a genomic reduction in migration rate dominates the extent of local genetic differentiation. Our analyses reveal that divergent selection alone is sufficient to generate genomic differentiation, and any following diversifying factors may increase the level of genetic differentiation between diverging strains in the process of speciation.",

    "abstract": "Candida auris is an emerging, multi-drug resistant, health care-associated fungal pathogen. Its predominant prevalence in hospitals and nursing homes indicates its ability to adhere to and colonize the skin, or persist in an environment outside the host - a trait unique from other Candida species. Besides being associated globally with life-threatening disseminated infections, C. auris also poses significant clinical challenges due to its ability to adhere to polymeric surfaces and form highly drug-resistant biofilms. Here, we performed bioinformatic studies to identify the presence of adhesin proteins in C. auris, with sequence as well as 3-D structural homologies to the major adhesin/invasin of C. albicans, Als3. Anti-Als3p antibodies generated by vaccinating mice with NDV-3A (a vaccine based on the N-terminus of Als3 protein formulated with alum) recognized C. auris in vitro, blocked its ability to form biofilms and enhanced macrophage-mediated killing of the fungus. Furthermore, NDV-3A vaccination induced significant levels of C. auris cross-reactive humoral and cellular immune responses, and protected immunosuppressed mice from lethal C. auris disseminated infection, compared to the control alum-vaccinated mice. Finally, NDV-3A potentiated the protective efficacy of the antifungal drug micafungin, against C. auris candidemia. Identification of Als3-like adhesins in C. auris makes it a target for immunotherapeutic strategies using NDV-3A, a vaccine with known efficacy against other Candida species and safety as well as efficacy in clinical trials. Considering that C. auris can be resistant to almost all classes of antifungal drugs, such an approach has profound clinical relevance.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCandida auris has emerged as a major health concern to hospitalized patients and nursing home subjects. C. auris strains display multidrug resistance to current antifungal therapy and cause lethal infections. We have determined that C. auris harbors homologs of C. albicans Als cell surface proteins. The C. albicans NDV-3A vaccine, harboring the N-terminus of Als3p formulated with alum, generates cross-reactive antibodies against C. auris clinical isolates and protects neutropenic mice from hematogenously disseminated C. auris infection. Importantly, the NDV-3A vaccine displays an additive protective effect in neutropenic mice when combined with micafungin. Due to its proven safety and efficacy in humans against C. albicans infection, our studies support the expedited testing of the NDV-3A vaccine against C. auris in future clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cancer with a high mortality rate and a rising incidence rate in the developed world. The disease shows variable drug response and outcome. Molecular profiling techniques have been used to better understand the variability between tumours as well as cancer models such as cell lines. Drug discovery programs use cell lines as a proxy for human cancers to characterize their molecular makeup and drug response, identify relevant indications and discover biomarkers. In order to maximize the translatability and the clinical relevance of in vitro studies, selection of optimal cancer models is imperative. We have developed a deep learning based method to measure the similarity between CRC tumors and other tumors or disease models such as cancer cell lines. Our method efficiently leverages multi-omics data sets containing copy number alterations, gene expression and point mutations, and learns latent factors that describe the data in lower dimension. These latent factors represent the patterns across gene expression, copy number, and mutational profiles which are clinically relevant and explain the variability of molecular profiles across tumours and cell lines. Using these, we propose a refined colorectal cancer sample classification and provide best-matching cell lines in terms of multi-omics for the different subtypes. These findings are relevant for patient stratification and selection of cell lines for early stage drug discovery pipelines, biomarker discovery, and target identification.",

    "abstract": "In recent years hundreds of novel RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been identified leading to the discovery of novel RNA-binding domains (RBDs). Furthermore, unstructured or disordered low-complexity regions of RBPs have been identified to play an important role in interactions with nucleic acids. However, these advances in understanding RBPs are limited mainly to eukaryotic species and we only have limited tools to faithfully predict RNA-binders from bacteria. Here, we describe a support vector machine (SVM)-based method, called TriPepSVM, for the classification of RNA-binding proteins and non-RBPs. TriPepSVM applies string kernels to directly handle protein sequences using tri-peptide frequencies. Testing the method in human and bacteria, we find that several RBP-enriched tripeptides occur more often in structurally disordered regions of RBPs. TriPepSVM outperforms existing applications, which consider classical structural features of RNA-binding or homology, in the task of RBP prediction in both human and bacteria. Finally, we predict 66 novel RBPs in Salmonella Typhimurium and validate the bacterial proteins ClpX, DnaJ and UbiG to associate with RNA in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary diversification of animal behavior is often associated with changes in the structure and function of nervous systems. Such evolutionary changes arise either through alterations of individual neural components (\\\"mosaically\\\") or through scaling of the whole brain (\\\"conceitedly\\\"). Here we show that the evolution of a specific courtship behavior in Malawi cichlid fish, the construction of mating nests known as bowers, is associated with rapid, extensive, and specific diversification of orosensory, gustatory centers in the hindbrain. We find that hindbrain volume varies significantly between species that build pit (depression) compared to castle (mound) type bowers and that hindbrain features evolve rapidly and independently of phylogeny among castle-building species. Using immediate early gene expression, we confirmed a functional role for hindbrain structures during bower building. Comparisons of bower building species in neighboring Lake Tanganyika show patterns of neural diversification parallel to those in Lake Malawi. Our results suggest that mosaic brain evolution via alterations to individual brain structures is more extensive and predictable than previously appreciated.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-high field 7-Tesla (7T) MRI has the potential to advance our understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). To date, few studies have quantified the advantage of resting state functional MRI (fMRI) at 7T compared to 3-Tesla (3T). We conducted a series of experiments that demonstrate the improvement in temporal signal-to-noise ratio (TSNR) of a multi-echo fMRI protocol with ultra-high field 7T, compared to 3T MRI in healthy controls (HC). We also directly tested the enhancement in ultra-high field 7T fMRI signal power by examining the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a small midbrain structure that is critical to the expected neuropathology of MDD but difficult to discern with standard 3T MRI. We demonstrate 200-300% improvement in TSNR and resting state functional connectivity coefficients provided by ultra-high field 7T fMRI compared to 3T, indicating enhanced power for detection of functional neural architecture. A multi-echo based acquisition protocol and signal denoising pipeline afforded greater gain in signal power at ultra-high field compared to classic acquisition and denoising pipelines. Furthermore, ultra-high field fMRI revealed mood-related neuro-circuit disturbances in patients with MDD compared to HC, which were not detectable with 3T fMRI. Ultra-high field 7T fMRI may provide an effective tool for studying functional neural architecture relevant to MDD and other neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis pathology is driven by the type 3 cytokines IL-17 and Il-22, but little is understood about the dynamics that initiate alterations in tissue homeostasis. Here, we use mouse models, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), computational inference and cell lineage mapping to show that psoriasis induction reconfigures the functionality of skin-resident ILCs to initiate disease. Tissue-resident ILCs amplified an initial IL-23 trigger and were sufficient, without circulatory ILCs, to drive pathology, indicating that ILC tissue remodeling initiates psoriasis. Skin ILCs expressed type 2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 in steady state, but were epigenetically poised to become ILC3-like cells. ScRNA-seq profiles of ILCs from psoriatic and naive skin of wild type (WT) and Rag1-/- mice form a dense continuum, consistent with this model of fluid ILC states. We inferred biological \\\"topics\\\" underlying these states and their relative importance in each cell with a generative model of latent Dirichlet allocation, showing that ILCs from untreated skin span a spectrum of states, including a naive/quiescent-like state and one expressing the Cd74 and Il13 but little Il5. Upon disease induction, this spectrum shifts, giving rise to a greater proportion of classical Il5- and Il13- expressing \\\"ILC2s\\\" and a new, mixed ILC2/ILC3-like subset, expressing Il13, Il17, and Il22. Using these key topics, we related the cells through transitions, revealing a quiescence-ILC2-ILC3s state trajectory. We demonstrated this plasticity in vivo, combining an IL-5 fate mouse with IL-17A and IL-22 reporters, validating the transition of IL-5-producing ILC2s to IL-22- and IL-17A-producing cells during disease initiation. Thus, steady-state skin ILCs are actively repressed and cued for a plastic, type 2 response, which, upon induction, morphs into a type 3 response that drives psoriasis. This suggests a general model where specific immune activities are primed in healthy tissue, dynamically adapt to provocations, and left unchecked, drive pathological remodeling.",

This cross-sectional study aims to delineate the contributions of different aspects of impulsivity to transmission risk behavior, among female inmates living in a prison in Jakarta (N=214). The relationships between various aspects of impulsivity, risky behavior and seropositivity were tested using analyses of variance and logistic regression analyses. Motor impulsivity was related to alcohol use, reward-related impulsivity to drug use, and cognitive/goal-directed impulsivity to sexual risk behavior. Finally, goal-directed impulsivity was also directly associated with seropositivity. Specific aspects of impulsivity are associated with different types of risky behaviors in Indonesian female prisoners, what can be relevant for future studies on infection prevention strategies for such a population.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe aim was to determine effects of diluent monomer and monocalcium phosphate monohydrate (MCPM) on polymerization kinetics and volumetric stability, apatite precipitation, strontium release and fatigue of novel dual-paste composites for vertebroplasty.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsPolypropylene (PPGDMA) or triethylene (TEGDMA) glycol dimethacrylates (25 wt%) diluents were combined with urethane dimethacrylate (70 wt%) and hydroxyethyl methacrylate (5 wt%). 70 wt% filler containing glass particles, glass fibers (20 wt%) and polylysine (5 wt%) was added. Benzoyl peroxide and MCPM (10 or 20 wt%) or N-tolyglycine glycidyl methacrylate and tristrontium phosphate (15 wt%) were included to give initiator or activator pastes. Commercial PMMA (Simplex) and bone composite (Cortoss) were used for comparison.\\n\\nATR-FTIR was used to determine thermal activated polymerization kinetics of initiator pastes at 50-80 {degrees}C. Paste stability, following storage at 4-37 {degrees}C, was assessed visually or through mixed paste polymerization kinetics at 25 {degrees}C. Polymerization shrinkage and heat generation were calculated from final monomer conversions. Subsequent expansion and surface apatite precipitation in simulated body fluid (SBF) were assessed gravimetrically and via SEM. Strontium release into water was assessed using ICP-MS. Biaxial flexural strength (BFS) and fatigue properties were determined at 37 {degrees}C after 4 weeks in SBF.\\n\\nResultsPolymerization profiles all exhibited an inhibition time before polymerization as predicted by free radical polymerization mechanisms. Initiator paste inhibition times and maximum reaction rates were described well by Arrhenius plots. Plot extrapolation, however, underestimated lower temperature paste stability. Replacement of TEGDMA by PPGDMA, enhanced paste stability, final monomer conversion, water-sorption induced expansion and strontium release but reduced polymerisation shrinkage and heat generation. Increasing MCPM level enhanced volume expansion, surface apatite precipitation and strontium release. Although the experimental composite flexural strengths were lower compared to those of commercially available Simplex, the extrapolated low load fatigue lives of all materials were comparable.\\n\\nConclusionsIncreased inhibition times at high temperature give longer predicted shelf-life whilst stability of mixed paste inhibition times is important for consistent clinical application. Increased volumetric stability, strontium release and apatite formation should encourage bone integration. Replacing TEGDMA by PPGDMA and increasing MCPM could therefore increase suitability of the above novel bone composites for vertebroplasty. Long fatigue lives of the composites may also ensure long-term durability of the materials.",

TAK-071 is an M1-selective positive allosteric modulator that improves cognitive deficits induced by scopolamine, a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist, with reduced side effects on gastrointestinal function in rats. In this study, we explored changes in quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) power bands, with or without scopolamine challenge, as a non-invasive translational biomarker for the effect of TAK-071 in cynomolgus monkeys. Scopolamine has been reported to increase theta and delta power bands and decrease alpha power band in healthy volunteers. In line with the clinical observations, scopolamine (25-100 {micro}g/kg, subcutaneous administration [s.c.]) increased theta and delta power bands in cynomolgus monkeys in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it had the opposite effect on alpha power band. The effects of TAK-071 on scopolamine (25 {micro}g/kg, s.c.)-induced qEEG spectral changes were examined using an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil and a muscarinic M1/M4 receptor agonist xanomeline as comparative cholinomimetics. TAK-071 (0.3-3 mg/kg, oral administration [p.o.]), donepezil (3 mg/kg, p.o.), and xanomeline (1 mg/kg, s.c.) suppressed the scopolamine-induced increases in alpha, theta, and delta power bands. These results suggest that changes in specific qEEG power bands, in particular theta and delta power bands in the context of scopolamine challenge, could be used as translational biomarkers for the evaluation of TAK-071 in clinical studies.",

All participants (N = 74, mean age 60.7 yrs at inclusion, 48 females) performed the Color-Word Interference Test (CWIT). Response time on the third condition was used as a measure of response inhibition (RI) and divided into three classes (fast, medium and slow). The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was used for calculating the relative importance of selected LV volume features from the LME model in predicting RI class. Finally, the two most important extracted features were fed into a 10-fold cross-validation framework, estimating the accuracy, precision and recall of the RI class prediction.\\n\\nResultsFour LME based features were selected to characterize LV volume trajectories: steepness of LV volume change and the LV volume at the time of inclusion, each from the right and left hemisphere. The XGBoost procedure selected the steepness measure from the right and the volume at inclusion from the left hemisphere as the two most important features to predict RI performance. The 10-fold cross validation procedure showed a recall, precision and accuracy score (.40 - .50) that were clearly above chance level.\\n\\nConclusionMeasures of the LV volume trajectories gave a fairly good prediction of response inhibition performance, confirming the role of LV volume as a biomarker of cognitive function in older adults.

Population data suggest coronary ischemia significantly contributes to PEA, but the mechanism is unknown.\\n\\nObjectivesWe hypothesize ischemic preconditioning (IPC) in the setting of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction can convert ischemia-induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) into ischemia-induced PEA.\\n\\nMethodsUsing percutaneous coronary interventions in anesthetized swine, we studied the effect of IPC prior to ischemia on arrhythmic burden in normal animals and in animals with LV dysfunction. IPC protocol: four cycles of three minutes of coronary occlusion followed by seven minutes of reperfusion. Chronic LV dysfunction protocol: two serial infarcts in two coronary territories, separated by one week of recovery.\\n\\nResultsIn normal animals, IPC prior to ischemia significantly reduced VF incidence (2/8 IPC vs. 7/8 control). In IPC animals with VF, the time to VF was significantly delayed (37.2 {+/-} 7.3 min vs. 20.7 {+/-} 4.9 min, p<0.005). In chronic LV dysfunction animals (EF 15% {+/-} 5%), ischemia caused PEA in all animals (18/18). In non-preconditioned animals, VF followed PEA in all cases (12/12). In preconditioned animals, PEA sustained without VF in 2/6 animals. In 4/6 animals, PEA was prolonged and time to VF was significantly delayed compared to non-preconditioned animals (33.7 {+/-} 7.8 min vs. 12.2 {+/-} 5.0 min, p<0.0001).\\n\\nConclusionIPC delays/prevents VF. IPC with LV dysfunction prior to ischemia produces prolonged PEA. IPC with LV dysfunction prior to ischemia is likely an important mechanism for human PEA arrest. This is the first animal model of ischemic pulseless electrical activity.",

    "abstract": "Natural resource rules exist to manage resources and the people that interact with them. These rules often fail because people do not comply with them. Decisions to comply with natural resource rules often are based on attitudes about legitimacy of rules and the perceived risks of breaking rules. Trust in agencies promulgating rules in part may determine perceptions of legitimacy of the rule, and in turn depends on individuals trust in different agency actors. The purpose of this research was to explore the relationship between fishing rule noncompliance and trust in scientists, a key group within management agencies. We interviewed 41 individuals in one rural fishing community in the Brazilian Pantanal from April to August, 2016, to assess (1) noncompliance rates, (2) noncompliance-related attitudes, and (3) the relationship between trust in scientists and noncompliance decisions in the region. We found that among study participants, noncompliance was common and overt. Trust in scientists performing research in the region was the best predictor of noncompliance rate with a fishing rule (nonparametric rank correlation{rho} = -0.717; Probit model pseudo-R2 = 0.241). Baseline data from this research may help inform future interventions to minimize IUU fishing and protect the Pantanal fishery. Although our results are specific to one community in the Pantanal, trust in scientists is potentially an important factor for compliance decisions in similar situations around the world. These results build not only on compliance theory but also speak to the important role that many scientists play in the geographic areas in which they conduct their research.",

    "abstract": "Induction of plant defense against insect herbivory is initiated by a combination of both, mechanical wounding and chemical factors. In order to study both effects independently on plant defense induction, SpitWorm, a computer controlled device which mimics the damage pattern of feeding insect larvae on leaves and can additionally apply oral secretions (OS) or other solutions to the  biting site during  feeding, was developed and evaluated. The amount of OS left by a Spodoptera littoralis larva during feeding on Phaseolus lunatus (lima bean) leaves was estimated by combining larval foregut volume, biting rate, and quantification of a fluorescent dye injected into the larvaes foregut prior to feeding. For providing OS amounts by SpitWorm equivalent to larval feeding, dilution and delivery rate were optimized. The effectiveness of SpitWorm was tested by comparing volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions of P. lunatus leaves treated with either SpitWorm, MecWorm or S. littoralis larvae. Identification and quantification of emitted VOCs revealed that SpitWorm induced a volatile bouquet that is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to herbivory. Additionally, RT-qPCR of four jasmonic acid responsive genes showed that SpitWorm, in contrast to MecWorm, induces the same regulation pattern as insect feeding. Thus, SpitWorm mimics insect herbivory almost identical to real larvae feeding.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication, transcription and chromatin remodeling are coordinated to ensure accurate duplication of genetic and epigenetic information. In regard to DNA replication, trypanosomatid parasites such as Trypanosoma brucei display unusual properties including significantly fewer origins of replication than model eukaryotes, a highly divergent Origin Replication Complex (ORC), and an apparent lack of several replication factor homologs. Although recent studies in T. brucei indicate functional links among DNA replication, transcription, and antigenic variation, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we adapted an unbiased technology for the identification of replication fork proteins called iPOND (isolation of proteins on nascent DNA) to T. brucei, its first application to a parasite system. This led to the mass spectrometric identification of core replication machinery and of proteins associated with transcription, chromatin organization, and DNA repair that were enriched in the vicinity of an unperturbed active replication fork. Of a total of 410 enriched proteins, among which DNA polymerase  and replication factor C were scoring in the top, around 25% of the proteins identified were of unknown function and, therefore, have the potential to be essential trypanosome-specific replication proteins. Initial characterization of a protein annotated as a Replication Factor C subunit (Tb927.10.7990), and a protein of unknown function (Tb927.3.5370) revealed that both proteins retain nuclear localization throughout the cell cycle. While Tb927.3.5370 appeared to be a dispensable gene, Tb927.10.7990 proved to be essential since its silencing caused a growth defect in procyclic cells, accumulation of zoids and impaired DNA replication. Future studies on the generated proteins list can contribute to the understanding of DNA replication dynamics in T. brucei and how replication is coordinated with other cellular processes to maintain genome integrity.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has shown that short-term fasting in healthy individuals (HIs) is associated with changes in risky decision-making. The current experiment was designed to examine the influence of short-term fasting in HIs on four types of impulsivity: reflection impulsivity, risky decision-making, delay aversion, and action inhibition. HIs were tested twice, once when fasted for 20 hours, and once when satiated. Participants demonstrated impaired action inhibition when fasted; committing significantly more errors of commission during a food-related Affective Shifting Task. Participants also displayed decreased reflection impulsivity when fasted, opening significantly more boxes during the Information Sampling Task (IST). There were no significant differences in performance between fasted and satiated sessions for risky decision-making or delay aversion. These findings may have implications for understanding eating disorders such as Bulimia Nervosa (BN). Although BN has been characterised as a disorder of poor impulse control, inconsistent findings when comparing individuals with BN and HIs on behavioural measures of impulsivity question this characterisation. Since individuals with BN undergo periods of short-term fasting, the inconsistent findings could be due to differences in the levels of satiation of participants. The current results indicate that fasting can selectively influence performance on the IST, a measure of impulsivity previously studied in BN. However, the results from the IST were contrary to the original hypothesis and should be replicated before specific conclusions can be made.",

    "abstract": "Human skeletal muscle fibers exist across a continuum of slow [-&gt;] fast-twitch. The amount of each fiber type (FT) influences muscle performance but remains largely unexplored in elite athletes, particularly from strength/power sports. To address this nescience, vastus lateralis (VL) biopsies were performed on World/Olympic (female, n=6, \\\"WCF\\\") and National-caliber (female, n=9, \\\"NCF\\\"; and male, n=6, \\\"NCM\\\") American weightlifters. Participant accolades included 3 Olympic Games, 19 World Championships, 25 National records, and >170 National/International medals. Samples were analyzed for myosin heavy chain (MHC) content via SDS-PAGE using two distinct techniques: single fiber (SF) distribution (%) and homogenate (HG) composition. These athletes displayed the highest MHC IIa concentrations ever reported in healthy VL (23{+/-}9% I, 5{+/-}3% I/IIa, 67{+/-}13% IIa, and 6{+/-}10% IIa/IIx), with WCF expressing a notable 71{+/-}17% (NCF=67{+/-}8%, NCM=63{+/-}16%). The heavyweights accounted for 91% of the MHC IIa/IIx fibers. When compared to SF, HG overestimated MHC I (23{+/-}9 vs. 31{+/-}9%) and IIx (0{+/-}0 vs. 3{+/-}6%) by misclassifying I/IIa fibers as I and IIa/IIx fibers as IIx. These findings suggest athlete caliber (World vs. National), training experience, and body mass determine FT% more than sex and refutes the common pronouncement that women possess more slow and fewer fast-twitch fibers than men. Our results also show the abundance of pure MHC IIa and rarity of IIx in elite strength/power-trained athletes, indicate a potential link between MHC IIa/IIx frequency and body mass, and question the fidelity of HG as a measure of FT% distribution. The extreme fast-twitch abundance partially explains how elite weightlifters generate high forces in rapid time-frames. These data highlight the need for more cellular and molecular muscle research on elite anaerobic athletes.",

    "abstract": "The root-knot nematode (RKN) species Meloidogyne incognita and M. javanica cause substantial root system damage and suppress yield of susceptible cowpea cultivars. The narrow-based genetic resistance conferred by the Rk gene, present in some commercial cultivars, is not effective against Rk-virulent populations found in several cowpea production areas. The dynamics of virulence within RKN populations require a broadening of the genetic base of resistance in elite cowpea cultivars. As part of this goal, F1 and F2 populations from the cross CB46-Null (susceptible) x FN-2-9-04 (resistant) were phenotyped for M. javanica induced root-galling (RG) and egg-mass production (EM) in controlled growth chamber and greenhouse infection assays. In addition, F2:3 families of the same cross were phenotyped for RG on field sites infested with Rk-avirulent M. incognita and M. javanica. The response of F1 to RG and EM indicated that resistance to RKN in FN-2-9-04 is partially dominant, as supported by the degree of dominance in the F2 and F2:3 populations. Two QTLs associated with both RG and EM resistance were detected on chromosomes Vu01 and Vu04. The QTL on Vu01 was most effective against aggressive M. javanica, whereas both QTLs were effective against avirulent M. incognita. Allelism tests with CB46 x FN-2-9-04 progeny indicated that these parents share the same RKN resistance locus on Vu04, but the strong, broad-based resistance in FN-2-9-04 is conferred by the additive effect of the novel resistance QTL on Vu01. This novel resistance in FN-2-9-04 is an important resource for broadening RKN resistance in elite cowpea cultivars.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput DNA sequencing data is accumulating in public repositories, and efficient approaches for storing and indexing such data are in high demand. In recent research, several graph data structures have been proposed to represent large sets of sequencing data and to allow for efficient querying of sequences. In particular, the concept of labeled de Bruijn graphs has been explored by several groups. While there has been good progress towards representing the sequence graph in small space, methods for storing a set of labels on top of such graphs are still not sufficiently explored. It is also currently not clear how characteristics of the input data, such as the sparsity and correlations of labels, can help to inform the choice of method to compress the graph labeling. In this work, we present a new compression approach, Multi-BRWT, which is adaptive to different kinds of input data. We show an up to 29% improvement in compression performance over the basic BRWT method, and up to a 68% improvement over the current state-of-the-art for de Bruijn graph label compression. To put our results into perspective, we present a systematic analysis of five different state-of-the-art annotation compression schemes, evaluate key metrics on both artificial and real-world data and discuss how different data characteristics influence the compression performance. We show that the improvements of our new method can be robustly reproduced for different representative real-world datasets.",

In this study, we used electron tomography to investigate the stress-induced ultrastructural changes in the cytoplasm of yeast cells. After ATP depletion, we observed a significant cytosolic compaction and an extensive cytoplasmic reorganization, as well as the emergence of distinct membrane-bound and membrane-less organelles. By using correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), we further demonstrate that one of these membrane-less organelles is generated by the reversible polymerization into large bundles of filaments of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B), an essential enzyme in the initiation of protein synthesis. The changes we observe are part of a stress-induced survival strategy, allowing yeast cells to save energy, protect proteins from degradation, and inhibit protein functionality by forming assemblies of said proteins.",

We increase effective sample size by an average of two-fold by applying the Covariates for Multi-phenotype Studies (CMS) approach, identifying 588 significant SNP-metabolite associations, including 248 novel associations. We further show that many of these SNPs are master metabolic regulators, balancing the relative proportion of dozens of metabolite levels. We then identify the first associations to changes in metabolic levels across time as well as evidence of genetic interaction with statin use.

Compared to traditional approaches, BADGERS uses GWAS summary statistics as input and does not require multiple traits to be measured in the same cohort. We applied BADGERS to two independent datasets for late-onset Alzheimers disease (AD; N=61,212). Among 1,738 traits in the UK biobank, we identified 48 significant associations for AD. Family history, high cholesterol, and numerous traits related to intelligence and education showed strong and independent associations with AD. Further, we identified 41 significant associations for a variety of AD endophenotypes. While family history and high cholesterol were strongly associated with AD subgroups and pathologies, only intelligence and education-related traits predicted pre-clinical cognitive phenotypes. These results provide novel insights into the distinct biological processes underlying various risk factors for AD.",

    "abstract": "Although significant advances have been made toward functionally identifying human regulatory elements, existing genome-scale reporter methods preferentially detect either enhancers or promoters. Here we develop GRAMc, a highly reproducible unbiased Genome-scale Reporter Assay Method for cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). GRAMc combines the versatility of traditional reporter constructs and the scalability of DNA barcode reporters, and unites the complementary advantages of several currently available high-throughput reporter assays. We demonstrate that GRAMc can reliably measure cis-regulatory activity of nearly 90% of the human genome in 200 million HepG2 cells with randomly fragmented ~800bp inserts. By using the GRAMc-identified CRMs, we show that CRMs identified in one cell type are useful for predicting gene regulatory programs not only within that cell type but also between cell types or conditions separated in time and space. In addition, the GRAMc-identified CRMs support the hypothesis that SINE/Alu elements are rich sources of regulatory evolution. Finally, the observation that the majority of experimentally identified regulatory elements do not overlap with computationally predicted elements underscores the necessity of an efficient and unbiased genome-scale reporter assay.",

However, due to the large combinatorial space of possible TF cocktails, it remains difficult to identify TFs that reprogram specific cell types. Here, we develop Reprogram-Seq to experimentally screen thousands of TF cocktails for reprogramming performance. Reprogram-Seq leverages organ-specific cell atlas data with single-cell perturbation and computational analysis to predict, evaluate, and optimize TF combinations that reprogram a cell type of interest. Focusing on the cardiac system, we perform Reprogram-Seq on MEFs using an undirected library of 48 cardiac factors and separately on a directed library of 10 epicardial-related TFs. We identify a novel combination of 3 TFs which efficiently reprogram MEFs to epicardial-like cells that are transcriptionally, molecularly, morphologically, and functionally similar to primary epicardial cells.

Here, we examine the hierarchy of the ligase and substrate recruitment kinetics onto PCNA at sites of DNA replication. We demonstrate that the C-terminal end of Cdt2 bears a PCNA interaction protein motif (PIP box, Cdt2PIP), which is necessary and sufficient for binding of Cdt2 to PCNA. Cdt2PIP binds PCNA directly with high affinity, two orders of magnitude tighter than the PIP box of Cdt1. X-ray crystallographic structures of PCNA bound to Cdt2PIP and Cdt1PIP show that the peptides occupy all three binding sites of the trimeric PCNA ring. Mutating Cdt2PIP weakens the interaction with PCNA, rendering CRL4Cdt2 less effective in Cdt1 ubiquitination and leading to defects in Cdt1 degradation. The molecular mechanism we present suggests a new paradigm for bringing substrates to the CRL4-type ligase, where the substrate receptor and substrates bind to a common multivalent docking platform to enable subsequent ubiquitination.\\n\\nSummary blurbThe C-terminal end of Cdt2 contains a PIP-box for binding to PCNA to promote CRL4Cdt2 function, creating a new paradigm, where the substrate receptor and substrates bind to a common multivalent docking platform for ubiquitination.",

Here, we use the animal model to demonstrate a physiological mechanism for bodily feedback and its causal role in the stabilization of emotional states. We report that during fear-related freezing mice breathe at 4Hz and show, using probabilistic modelling, that optogenetic perturbation of this feedback specifically reduces freezing maintenance without impacting its initiation. This rhythm is transmitted by the olfactory bulb to the prefrontal cortex where it organizes neural firing and optogenetic probing of the circuit demonstrates frequency-specific tuning that maximizes prefrontal cortex responsivity at 4Hz, the breathing frequency during freezing. These results point to a brain-body-brain loop in which the initiation of emotional behavior engenders somatic changes which then feedback to the cortex to directly participate in sustaining emotional states.",

Among them, Ezh2 is responsible for catalyzing the epigenetic repressive mark H3K27me3 and is essential for animal development. The ability of zebrafish embryos lacking both maternal and zygotic ezh2 to form a normal body plan provides a unique model to comprehensively study Ezh2 function during early development in vertebrates. By using a multi-omics approach, we found that Ezh2 is required for the recruitment of H3K27me3 and Polycomb group protein Rnf2. However, in absence of Ezh2, only minor changes in global H3K4me3 levels and gene and protein expression occurred. These changes were mainly due to local deregulation of transcription factors outside their normal expression boundaries. Altogether, our results in zebrafish show that Polycomb-mediated gene repression is important only after the body plan is formed to maintain spatially restricted transcriptional profiles of Polycomb-targeted transcription factors.",

    "abstract": "The size structure of plankton communities is an important determinant of their functions in marine ecosystems. However, few studies have quantified how organism size varies within species across space. Using a recently-digitised museum collection, we investigate at high intraspecific resolution how planktonic foraminifera, an important microfossil group, vary in size across the tropical and subtropical oceans of the world. We measured 3799 individuals of nine species in 53 seafloor sediments and analysed potential size biases in the museum collection. For each site, we obtained corresponding local values of mean annual sea-surface temperature (SST), net primary productivity (NPP), and relative abundance of each species. Given former studies, we expected species to reach largest shell sizes under optimal environmental conditions. At species level, we find the expected pattern; however, at population level, species greatly differ in how much size variation is explained by SST, NPP and/or relative abundance. While some species show a high predictability of size variation given one single variable (Trilobatus sacculifer, Globigerinella siphonifera, Pulleniatina obliquiloculata, Globorotalia truncatulinoides), other species showed either weak or no relationships between size and the studied covariates (Globigerinoides ruber, G. conglobatus, Neogloboquadrina dutertrei, G. menardii, Globoconella inflata). By incorporating intraspecific variation and sampling broader geographical ranges compared to previous studies, we conclude that shell size variation in planktonic foraminifera species cannot be consistently predicted by the environment. Our results caution against the general use of size as a proxy for planktonic foraminifera environmental optima, and emphasise the need for more studies analysing their within-species size variation. More generally, our findings show that contrasting results can be obtained when analysing patterns at different organisational levels, and highlights the utility of natural history collections.",

Variable sites violating HWE may be identi[fi]ed as technical errors in the sequencing or genotyping process, or they may be of special evolutionary interest. Large-scale genetic studies based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods have become more prevalent as cost is decreasing but these methods are still associated with statistical uncertainty. The large-scale studies usually consist of samples from diverse ancestries that make the existence of some degree of population structure almost inevitable. Precautions are therefore needed when analyzing these datasets, as population structure causes deviations from HWE. Here we propose a method that takes population structure into account in the testing for HWE, such that other factors causing deviations from HWE can be detected. We show the effectiveness of our method in NGS data, as well as in genotype data, for both simulated and real datasets, where the use of genotype likelihoods enables us to model the uncertainty for low-depth sequencing data.",

Gene panel sequencing failed to identify any causal variants in the FGD1 gene which underlies this condition, but variants in a number of genes suggest alternative clinical diagnoses across five patients (~ 36%). The novel variants identified here maps to developmentally important genes including SRCAP, OFD1, NIPBL, GRIN2A and KMT2D6. Our result demonstrates the extensive heterogeneity underlying OFC and emphasises the need for systematic phenotyping of patients with rare conditions. Gene panel sequencing has the potential to cost-effectively resolve ambiguous clinical diagnoses, but rigorous attention should be paid to gene coverage as our results suggest highly variable read depths across individual gene exons and this may reduce the quality of variant calls at specific locations.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide significant variants associated with combined risk for major psychiatric disorders on chromosome 10q24 affect the expression of the cytosolic 5-nucleotidase II (NT5C2, cN-II) in population controls, implicating it as a psychiatric susceptibility gene. Risk alleles are associated with reduced expression of this gene in the developing and adult brain, but the resulting neurobiological risk mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we provide further evidence for the association of NT5C2 with psychiatric disorders, and use a functional genetics approach to gain a deeper understanding of the function of this risk gene in the nervous system. NT5C2 expression was significantly reduced in the post-mortem brain of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients, and its protein predominately expressed in neurons within the adult brain. Using human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), we found that NT5C2 expression peaked at the neural progenitor state, where the encoded protein was ubiquitously distributed through the cell. NT5C2 knockdown in hNPCs elicited transcriptomic changes associated with protein translation, that were accompanied by regulation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling and ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) activity. To identify the effect of reduced neuronal NT5C2 expression at a systems level, we knockdown its homologue, CG32549, in Drosophila melanogaster CNS. This elicited impaired climbing behaviour in the model organism. Collectively, our data implicate NT5C2 expression in risk for psychiatric disorders and in Drosophila melanogaster motility, and further suggest that risk is mediated via regulation of AMPK signalling and protein translation during early neurodevelopment.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide significant variants associated with combined risk for major psychiatric disorders on chromosome 10q24 affect the expression of the cytosolic 5-nucleotidase II (NT5C2, cN-II) in population controls, implicating it as a psychiatric susceptibility gene. Risk alleles are associated with reduced expression of this gene in the developing and adult brain, but the resulting neurobiological risk mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we provide further evidence for the association of NT5C2 with psychiatric disorders, and use a functional genetics approach to gain a deeper understanding of the function of this risk gene in the nervous system. NT5C2 expression was significantly reduced in the post-mortem brain of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients, and its protein predominately expressed in neurons within the adult brain. Using human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs), we found that NT5C2 expression peaked at the neural progenitor state, where the encoded protein was ubiquitously distributed through the cell. NT5C2 knockdown in hNPCs elicited transcriptomic changes associated with protein translation, that were accompanied by regulation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling and ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) activity. To identify the effect of reduced neuronal NT5C2 expression at a systems level, we knockdown its homologue, CG32549, in Drosophila melanogaster CNS. This elicited impaired climbing behaviour in the model organism. Collectively, our data implicate NT5C2 expression in risk for psychiatric disorders and in Drosophila melanogaster motility, and further suggest that risk is mediated via regulation of AMPK signalling and protein translation during early neurodevelopment.",

    "abstract": "A high quality genome annotation greatly facilitates successful cell line engineering. Standard draft genome annotation pipelines are based largely on de novo gene prediction, homology, and RNA-Seq data. However, draft annotations can suffer from incorrectly predictions of translated sequence, incorrect splice isoforms and missing genes. Here we generated a draft annotation for the newly assembled Chinese hamster genome and used RNA-Seq, proteomics, and Ribo-Seq to experimentally annotate the genome. We identified 4,333 new proteins compared to the hamster RefSeq protein annotation and 2,503 novel translational events (e.g., alternative splices, mutations, novel splices). Finally, we used this pipeline to identify the source of translated retroviruses contaminating recombinant products from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, including 131 type-C retroviruses, thus enabling future efforts to eliminate retroviruses by reducing the costs incurred with retroviral particle clearance. In summary, the improved annotation provides a more accurate platform for guiding CHO cell line engineering, including facilitating the interpretation of omics data, defining of cellular pathways, and engineering of complex phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Cells exposed to starvation have to adjust their metabolism to conserve energy and protect themselves. Protein synthesis is one of the major energy-consuming processes and as such has to be tightly controlled. The mechanism by which starved cells regulate the process of protein synthesis is largely unknown. Here, we report that the essential translation initiation factor eIF2B forms filaments in starved budding yeast cells. We demonstrate that filamentation is triggered by starvation-induced acidification of the cytosol, which is caused by an influx of protons from the extracellular environment. We show that filament assembly by eIF2B is necessary for rapid and efficient downregulation of translation. Importantly, this mechanism does not require the kinase Gcn2. Furthermore, analysis of site-specific variants of eIF2B suggests that eIF2B assembly results in enzymatically inactive filaments that promote stress survival and fast recovery of cells from starvation. We propose that translation regulation through protein assembly is a widespread mechanism that allows cells to adapt to fluctuating environments.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral isolation is a potent barrier to gene flow and a source of striking diversity in the animal kingdom. However, it remains unclear if the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between sex-specific traits required for behavioral isolation results mostly from physical linkage between signal and preference loci or from directional mate preferences. Here, we test this in the field crickets Gryllus rubens and G. texensis. These closely related species diverged with gene flow and have strongly diverged songs and preference functions for the mate calling song rhythm. We map quantitative trait loci for signal and preference traits (pQTL) as well as for gene expression associated with these traits (eQTL). We find strong, positive genetic covariance between song traits and between song and preference. Our results show that this is in part explained by incomplete physical linkage: although both linked pQTL and eQTL couple male and female traits, major effect loci for different traits were never on the same chromosome. We suggest that the finely-tuned, highly divergent preference functions are likely an additional source of LD between male and female traits in this system. Furthermore, pleiotropy of gene expression presents an underappreciated mechanism to link sexually dimorphic phenotypes.",

In the apical plant stem cell system, local accumulation of the small, highly mobile phytohormone auxin triggers differentiation while at the same time, pluripotent stem cells are maintained throughout the entire life-cycle. We find that stem cells are resistant to auxin mediated differentiation, but require low levels of signaling for their maintenance. We demonstrate that the WUSCHEL transcription factor confers this behavior by rheostatically controlling the auxin signaling and response pathway. Finally, we show that WUSCHEL acts via regulation of histone acetylation at target loci, including those with functions in the auxin pathway. Our results reveal an important mechanism that allows cells to differentially translate a potent and highly dynamic developmental signal into stable cell behavior with high spatial precision and temporal robustness.",

However, the general benefits of CIE are low and these benefits might even depend on decreased retest performances in the blocked-practicing control group, caused by retroactive inhibition. The aim of this study was to investigate if CIE represents a true learning phenomenon or possibly reflects confounding effects of retroactive inhibition. We tested 48 healthy human participants adapting their reaching movements to three different force field magnitudes. Subjects practiced the force fields in either a Blocked (B), Random (R), or Constant (C) schedule. In addition, subjects of the Blocked group performed either a retest schedule that did (Blocked-Matched; BM) or did not (Blocked-Unmatched; BU) control for retroactive inhibition. Results showed that retroactive inhibition did not affect the results of the BU group much and that the Random group showed a better consolidation performance compared to both Blocked groups. However, compared to the Constant group, the Random group showed only slight benefits in its memory consolidation of the mean performance across all force field magnitudes and no benefits in absolute performance values. This indicates that CIE reflects a true motor learning phenomenon, which is independent of retroactive inhibition. However, random practice is not always beneficial over constant practice.",

Here, we used continuous measures of episodic memory retrieval in combination with computational modelling of participants retrieval errors to distinguish between these two potential accounts of age-related memory deficits. In three experiments, young and older participants encoded stimuli displays consisting of everyday objects varying along different perceptual features (e.g., location, colour and orientation) in a circular space. At test, participants recreated the features of studied objects using a continuous response dial. Across all three experiments, we observed age-related declines in the precision of episodic memory retrieval, whereas age differences in retrieval success were limited to the most challenging task condition. Reductions in mnemonic precision were evident for retrieval of both item-based and contextual information, and persisted after controlling for age-related decreases in the fidelity of perception and working memory. The findings highlight impoverished precision of memory representations as one factor contributing to age-related episodic memory loss, and suggest that the cognitive and neural changes associated with older age can differentially affect distinct aspects of episodic retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Current practices in collaborative genomic data analysis (e.g. PCAWG [1]) necessitate all involved parties to exchange individual patient data and perform all analysis locally, or use a trusted server for maintaining all data to perform analysis in a single site (e.g. the Cancer Genome Collaboratory). Since both approaches involve sharing genomic sequence data - which is typically not feasible due to privacy issues, collaborative data analysis remains to be a rarity in genomic medicine.\\n\\nIn order to facilitate efficient and effective collaborative or remote genomic computation we introduce SkSES (Sketching algorithms for Secure Enclave based genomic data analysiS), a computational framework for performing data analysis and querying on multiple, individually encrypted genomes from several institutions in an untrusted cloud environment. Unlike other techniques for secure/privacy preserving genomic data analysis, which typically rely on sophisticated cryptographic techniques with prohibitively large computational overheads, SkSES utilizes the secure enclaves supported by current generation microprocessor architectures such as Intels SGX. The key conceptual contribution of SkSES is its use of sketching data structures that can fit in the limited memory available in a secure enclave.\\n\\nWhile streaming/sketching algorithms have been developed for many applications in computer science, their feasibility in genomics has remained largely unexplored. On the other hand, even though privacy and security issues are becoming critical in genomic medicine, available cryptographic techniques based on, e.g. homomorphic encryption or garbled circuits, fail to address the performance demands of this rapidly growing field. The alternative offered by Intels SGX, a combination of hardware and software solutions for secure data analysis, is severely limited by the relatively small size of a secure enclave, a private region of the memory protected from other processes. SkSES addresses this limitation through the use of sketching data structures to support efficient secure and privacy preserving SNP analysis across individually encrypted VCF files from multiple institutions. In particular SkSES provides the users the ability to query for the \\\"k most significant SNPs\\\" among any set of user specified SNPs and any value of k - even when the total number of SNPs to be maintained is far beyond the memory capacity of the secure enclave.\\n\\nResultsWe tested SkSES on the complete iDASH-2017 competition data set comprised of 1000 case and 1000 control samples related to an unknown phenotype. SkSES was able to identify the top SNPs with respect to the{chi} 2 statistic, among any user specified subset of SNPs across this data set of 2000 individually encrypted complete human genomes quickly and accurately - demonstrating the feasibility of secure and privacy preserving computation for genomic medicine via Intels SGX.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/ndokmai/sgx-genome-variants-search",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae is a close relative of the major human pathogen S. pneumoniae. While initially considered as a commensal species, it has been increasingly associated with lower-respiratory tract infections and high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). S. pseudopneumoniae is difficult to identify using traditional typing methods due to similarities with S. pneumoniae and other members of the mitis group (SMG). Using phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses of SMG genomes, we identified a new molecular marker specific for S. pseudopneumoniae and absent from any other bacterial genome sequenced to date. We found that a large number of known virulence and colonization genes are present in the core S. pseudopneumoniae genome and we reveal the impressive number of known and new surface-exposed proteins encoded by this species. Phylogenetic analyses of S. pseudopneumoniae show that specific clades are associated with allelic variants of core proteins. Resistance to tetracycline and macrolides, the two most common resistances, were encoded by Tn916-like integrating conjugative elements and Mega-2. Overall, we found a tight association of genotypic determinants of AMR as well as phenotypic AMR with a specific lineage of S. pseudopneumoniae. Taken together, our results sheds light on the distribution in S. pseudopneumoniae of genes known to be important during invasive disease and colonization and provide insight into features that could contribute to virulence, colonization and adaptation.\\n\\nImportanceS. pseudopneumoniae is an overlooked pathogen emerging as the causative agent of lower-respiratory tract infections and associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and exacerbation of COPD. However, much remains unknown on its clinical importance and epidemiology, mainly due to the lack of specific means to distinguish it from S. pneumoniae. Here, we provide a new molecular marker entirely specific for S. pseudopneumoniae. Furthermore, our research provides a deep analysis of the presence of virulence and colonization genes, as well as AMR determinants in this species. Our results provide crucial information and pave the way for further studies aiming at understanding the pathogenesis and epidemiology of S. pseudopneumoniae.",

Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, single cell RNA-sequencing and gene array data were utilised to examine DNA methylation signatures and associated gene expression changes in blood and hippocampus, and targeted bisulfite sequencing in cross cohort validation.

Path integration abilities vary across individuals but tend to deteriorate in old age. The specific causes of path integration errors, however, remain poorly characterized. Here, we combined tests of path integration performance with a novel analysis based on the Langevin diffusion equation, which allowed us to decompose errors into distinct causes that can corrupt path integration computations. Across age groups, the dominant errors were due to noise and a bias in speed estimation. Noise-driven errors accumulated with travel distance not elapsed time, suggesting that the dominant noise originates in the velocity input rather than within the integrator. Age-related declines were traced primarily to a growth in this unbiased noise. Together, these findings shed light on the contributors to path integration error and the mechanisms underlying age-related navigational deficits.",

    "abstract": "Heterozygous CHD8 mutations are associated with autism and macrocephaly with high penetrance in the human population. The reported mutations may have loss-of-function (haploinsufficient), hypomorphic or dominant negative effects on protein function. To determine the effects of reducing CHD8 protein function below haploinsufficient levels on brain development, we established a Chd8 allelic series in the mouse. Chd8 heterozygous mice exhibited relatively subtle brain overgrowth and little gene expression changes in the embryonic neocortex. In comparison, mild Chd8 hypomorphs displayed significant postnatal lethality, with surviving animals exhibiting more pronounced brain hyperplasia, and significantly altered expression of over 2000 genes. Autism-associated genes were downregulated and neural progenitor proliferation genes upregulated. Severe Chd8 hypomorphs displayed even greater transcriptional dysregulation, affecting genes and pathways that largely overlapped with those dysregulated in the mild hypomorphs. By contrast, homozygous, conditional deletion of Chd8 in early neuronal progenitors resulted in the induction of p53 target genes, cell cycle exit, apoptosis and pronounced brain hypoplasia. Intriguingly, increased progenitor proliferation in hypomorphs was primarily restricted to TBR2+ intermediate progenitors, suggesting critical roles for CHD8 in regulating the expansion of this population. Given the importance of these progenitors in human cortical growth, this observation suggests that human brain development might be more sensitive to CHD8 deficiency than the mouse. We conclude that brain development is acutely sensitive to CHD8 dosage and that the varying sensitivities of different progenitor populations and cellular processes to CHD8 dosage can result in non-linear effects on gene transcription and brain growth.",

House-hunting Temnothorax ants are adept at discovering and choosing the best available nest site for their colony: we propose that this is possible via rapid, decentralized estimation of the probability that each choice is best.

Our nest finding model in-corporates insights from approximate Bayesian computation as a model of colony-level behavior; and particle filtering as a model of Temnothorax \u2018tandem running\u2019. Our framework suggests that the mechanisms of complex collective behavior can sometimes be explained as a spatial enactment of Bayesian inference. It facilitates the generation of quantitative hypotheses regarding individual and collective movement behaviors when collective decisions must be made. It also points to the potential for bioinspired statistical techniques. Finally, it suggests simple mechanisms for collective decision-making in engineered systems, such as robot swarms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The physiological functions of the atypical MAP kinase ERK3 remain poorly characterized. Previous analysis of mice with a targeted insertion of the lacZ reporter in the Mapk6 locus (Mapk6lacZ) showed that inactivation of ERK3 in Mapk6lacZ mice leads to perinatal lethality associated with intrauterine growth restriction, defective lung maturation, and neuromuscular anomalies. To further explore the role of ERK3 in physiology and disease, we generated novel mouse models expressing a catalytically-inactive (Mapk6KD) or conditional (Mapk6{Delta}) allele of ERK3. Surprisingly, we found that mice devoid of ERK3 kinase activity or expression survive the perinatal period without any observable lung or neuromuscular phenotype. ERK3 mutant mice reached adulthood, were fertile and showed no apparent health problem. However, analysis of growth curves revealed that ERK3 kinase activity is ncessary for optimal post-natal growth. To gain insight into the genetic basis underlying the discrepancy in phenotypes of different Mapk6 mutant mouse models, we analyzed the regulation of genes flanking the Mapk6 locus by quantitative PCR. We found that expression of several Mapk6 neighboring genes is deregulated in Mapk6lacZ mice, but not in Mapk6KD or Mapk6{Delta} mutant mice. Our genetic analysis suggests that off-target effects of the targeting construct on local gene expression are likely to be responsible for the perinatal lethality phenotype of Mapk6lacZ mutant mice.",

    "abstract": "Many barriers discourage underrepresented students from pursuing science careers. To access graduate education, undergraduate students must first gain exposure to a particular subject and subsequently accumulate related coursework and research experience. Many underrepresented students lack exposure to developmental biology due to limited undergraduate course offerings and finite resources at smaller institutions. To address this disparity, a group of University of Michigan graduate students and postdoctoral fellows created a portable short course focusing on developmental biology, titled \\\"Developing Future Biologists\\\" (DFB). This weeklong educational initiative provides hands-on laboratory sessions, interactive lectures, and professional development workshops to teach students about developmental biology and increase awareness of scientific career options. To evaluate course effectiveness, we developed a pre-post assessment, incorporating main ideas from the BioCore Guide. Student understanding of basic concepts and perceived experience in developmental biology increased in DFB participants, despite the abbreviated nature of the course. Here, we provide all course materials and an in-depth analysis of the assessment we created. The DFB portable short course model is an easily adaptable tool that connects undergraduate students with opportunities for advanced study and lowers barriers for underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",

    "abstract": "Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are master regulators of development and differentiation. Mutation and dysregulation of PcG genes cause developmental defects and cancer. PcG proteins form condensates in the nucleus of cells and these condensates are the physical sites of PcG-targeted gene silencing. However, the physiochemical principles underlying the PcG condensate formation remain unknown. Here we show that Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) protein Cbx2, one member of the Cbx family proteins, contains a long stretch of intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Cbx2 undergoes phase separation to form condensates. Cbx2 condensates exhibit liquid-like properties and can concentrate DNA and nucleosomes. We demonstrate that the conserved residues within the IDR promote the condensate formation in vitro and in vivo. We further indicate that H3K27me3 has minimal effects on the Cbx2 condensate formation while depletion of core PRC1 subunits facilitates the condensate formation. Thus, our results reveal that PcG condensates assemble through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and suggest that PcG-bound chromatin is in part organized through phase-separated condensates.",

    "abstract": "The history of a trait within a lineage may influence its future evolutionary trajectory, but macroevolutionary theory of this process is not well developed. For example, consider the simple binary trait of living in cave versus surface habitat. The longer a species has been cave-dwelling, the more may accumulated loss of vision, pigmentation, and defense restrict future adaptation if the species encounters the surface environment. However, the Markov model of discrete trait evolution that is widely adopted in phylogenetics does not allow the rate of cave-to-surface transition to decrease with longer duration as a cave-dweller. Here, we describe three models of evolution that remove this  memory-less constraint, using a renewal process to generalize beyond the typical Poisson process of discrete trait macroevolution. We then show how the two-state renewal process can be used for inference, and we investigate the potential of phylogenetic comparative data to reveal different influences of trait duration, or  memory in trait evolution. We hope that such approaches may open new avenues for modeling trait evolution and for broad comparative tests of hypotheses that some traits become entrenched.",

    "abstract": "Multiplex families with a high prevalence of a psychiatric disorder are often examined to identify rare genetic variants with large effect sizes. In the present study, we analysed whether the risk for bipolar disorder (BD) in BD multiplex families is influenced by common genetic variants. Furthermore, we investigated whether this risk is conferred mainly by BD-specific risk variants or by variants also associated with the susceptibility to schizophrenia or major depression. In total, 395 individuals from 33 Andalusian BD multiplex families as well as 438 subjects from an independent, sporadic BD case-control cohort were analysed. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for BD, schizophrenia, and major depression were calculated and compared between the cohorts. Both the familial BD cases and unaffected family members had significantly higher PRS for all three psychiatric disorders than the independent controls, suggesting a high baseline risk for several psychiatric disorders in the families. Moreover, familial BD cases showed significantly higher BD PRS than unaffected family members and sporadic BD cases. A plausible hypothesis is that, in multiplex families with a general increase in risk for psychiatric disease, BD development is attributable to a high burden of common variants that confer a specific risk for BD. The present analyses, therefore, demonstrated that common genetic risk variants for psychiatric disorders are likely to contribute to the high incidence of affective psychiatric disorders in the multiplex families. The PRS explained only part of the observed phenotypic variance and rare variants might have also contributed to disease development.",

We then examined whether such effects are mediated via known cardiometabolic risk factors including body mass index (BMI), glycaemic traits, lipid levels and blood pressure. We further cross-checked our findings by two-sample MR and Multivariate MR analyses with publicly available summary statistics data. One standard deviation (SD) higher genetically determined height (~6.5 cm) was causally associated with a 14% decrease in CAD risk (OR= 0.86, 95% CI= 0.790.94). This causal association remained significant after performing sensitivity analyses relaxing pleiotropy assumptions. The causal effect of height on CAD risk appeared to be independent of risk factors such as lipid levels, blood pressure and BMI; association was reduced by only 1-3% after adjustment for potential mediators. We observed no direct causal effect of height on T2D risk, once its effect on BMI was taken into account (OR= 0.99, 95% CI= 0.96-1.02), suggesting that BMI acts as a mediator.",

The QUADAS-2 checklist was used to assess the methodological quality of each study. The diagnostic performance of miR-421 for GC were assessed by using Meta-DiSc 1.4 and STATA 14.0 statistical software.\\n\\nResultsA total of 172 GC patients and 154 healthy controls from three articles (four studies) were enrolled in this meta-analysis.

    "abstract": "A major cause of human blindness is the death of rod photoreceptors. As rods degenerate, synaptic structures between rod and rod bipolar cells dissolve and the rod bipolar cells extend their dendrites and occasionally make aberrant contacts. Such changes are broadly observed in blinding disorders caused by photoreceptor cell death and is thought to occur in response to deafferentation. How the remodeled retinal circuit affect visual processing following rod rescue is not known. To address this question, we generated transgenic mice wherein a disrupted cGMP-gated channel (CNG) gene can be repaired at the endogenous locus and at different stages of degeneration by tamoxifen-inducible cre-mediated recombination. In normal rods, light-induced closure of CNG channels leads to hyperpolarization of the cell, reducing neurotransmitter release at the synapse. Similarly, rods lacking CNG channel exhibit a resting membrane potential that was ~10mV hyperpolarized compared to WT rods, indicating diminished glutamate release. Retinas from these mice undergo stereotypic retinal remodeling as a consequence of rod malfunction and degeneration. Upon tamoxifen-induced expression of CNG channels, rods recovered their structure and exhibited normal light responses. Moreover, we show that the adult mouse retina displays a surprising degree of plasticity upon activation of rod input. Wayward bipolar cell dendrites establish contact with rods to support normal synaptic transmission, which is propagated to the retinal ganglion cells. These findings demonstrate remarkable plasticity extending beyond the developmental period and support efforts to repair or replace defective rods in patients blinded by rod degeneration.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCurrent strategies for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders are focused on the repair of the primary affected cell type. However, the defective neuron functions within a complex neural circuitry, which also becomes degraded during disease. It is not known whether a rescued neuron and the remodeled circuit will establish communication to regain normal function. We show that the adult mammalian neural retina exhibits a surprising degree of plasticity following rescue of rod photoreceptors. The wayward rod bipolar cell dendrites re-establish contact with rods to support normal synaptic transmission, which is propagated to the retinal ganglion cells. These findings support efforts to repair or replace defective rods in patients blinded by rod cell loss.",

However, a subset of VIP interneurons express ChAT, the synthetic enzyme for ACh, and are a potential local source of cortical ACh. Which neurotransmitters these VIP/ChAT interneurons (VCINs) release is unclear, and which post-synaptic cell types these transmitters target is not known. Using quantitative molecular analysis of VCIN pre-synaptic terminals, we show expression of the molecular machinery to release both ACh and GABA, with ACh release restricted to a subset of boutons. A systematic survey of potential post-synaptic cell types shows that VCINs release GABA primarily onto other inhibitory interneuron subtypes, while ACh neurotransmission is notably sparse, with most ACh release onto layer 1 interneurons and other VCINs. Therefore, VCINs are an alternative source of cortical ACh signaling that supplement GABA-mediated disinhibition with highly targeted excitation through ACh.",
