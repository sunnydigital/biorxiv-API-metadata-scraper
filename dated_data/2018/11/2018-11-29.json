    "abstract": "Real-time and large-scale surveillance of molecular markers of antimalarial drug resistance is a potential method of resistance monitoring, to complement therapeutic efficacy studies in settings where the latter are logistically challenging. This study investigates whether routinely used malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can be used for massive parallel amplicon sequencing. RDTs used for malaria diagnosis were routinely collected together with patient age and sex between 2014 and 2017, from two health centres in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. A subset of positive RDTs (n=2,184) were tested for Plasmodium DNA content. Those containing sufficient Plasmodium DNA (n=1,390) were used for library preparation, consisting of amplification of gene fragments from pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps and pfK13. A total of 5532 gene fragments were successfully analysed on a single Illumina Miseq flow cell. Pre-screening of samples for Plasmodium DNA content proved necessary and the nested PCR protocol applied for library preparation varied notably in PCR-positivity from 13-87%. We found a high frequency of the pfmdr1 codon 86N at 88%-97%, a significant decrease of the pfcrt wildtype CVMNK haplotype and elevated levels of the pfdhfr/pfdhps quadruple mutant ranging from 33%-51% between 2014-2017. No polymorphisms indicating artemisinin tolerance were discovered. Lastly, the demographic data indicate a large proportion of young adults (66%, interquartile range 11-28 years) presenting with P. falciparum infections. With some caution, our findings suggest that routine collection of RDTs could facilitate large-scale molecular surveillance of antimalarial resistance.\\n\\nImportance (word count: 147)Continuous spread and repeated emergence of Plasmodium falciparum parasites resistant towards one or more antimalarials represents an enormous threat to current treatment efficacy levels, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where 90% of malaria infections occur. In order to prevent substantial treatment failure, it is therefore recommended to monitor treatment efficacy every 2-3 years. Therapeutic efficacy studies, however, can present insurmountable logistical and financial challenges in some settings in sub-Saharan Africa. Molecular surveillance of antimalarial resistance is therefore an important proxy for treatment efficacy. However, the scale by which such studies can be performed depends on the development of high-throughput protocols and the accessibility of samples. If RDTs can be used in the high-throughput protocols available with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-technology, surveillance can be performed efficiently for any setting in which RDTs are already used for malaria diagnosis. The majority of settings in sub-Saharan Africa have access to RDTs.",

    "abstract": "There is significant current interest in decoding mental states from electro-encephalography (EEG) recordings. EEG signals are subject-specific, sensitive to disturbances, and have a low signal-to-noise ratio, which has been mitigated by the use of laboratory-grade EEG acquisition equipment under highly controlled conditions. In the present study, we investigate single-trial decoding of natural, complex stimuli based on scalp EEG acquired with a portable, 32 dry-electrode sensor system in a typical office setting. We probe generalizability by a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation approach. We demonstrate that Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained on a relatively small set of de-noised (averaged) pseudo-trials perform on par with classifiers trained on a large set of noisy single-trial samples. For visualization of EEG signatures exploited by SVM classifiers, we propose a novel method for computing sensitivity maps of EEG-based SVM classifiers. Moreover, we apply the NPAIRS resampling framework for estimation of map uncertainty and show that effect sizes of sensitivity maps for classifiers trained on small samples of de-noised data and large samples of noisy data are similar. Finally, we demonstrate that the average pseudo-trial classifier can successfully predict the class of single trials from withheld subjects, which allows for fast classifier training, parameter optimization and unbiased performance evaluation in machine learning approaches for brain decoding.",

    "abstract": "Background and objectivesAlzheimers disease (AD) is the progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by dementia, but no peripheral biomarkers available yet that can detect the AD. This study aimed to identify systems biomarker signatures in the AD through integrative analyses.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsWe used two microarray transcriptomics datasets of blood from AD patients to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Geneset and protein overrepresentation analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI), DEGs-Transcription Factor interactions, DEGs-MicroRNAs interactions, protein-drug interactions, and protein subcellular localizations analyses were done on common DEGs.\\n\\nResultsTotal 25 DEGs were detected between the two datasets. Integration of DEGs with biomolecular networks revealed hub proteins (TUBB, ATF3, NOL6, UQCRC1, SND1, CASP2, BTF3, INPP5K, VCAM1, and CSTF1), TFs (FOXC1, ZNF3, GEMIN7, and SMG9), miRNAs (mir-20a-5p, mir-93-5p, mir-16-5p, let-7b-5p, mir-708-5p, mir-24-3p, mir-26b-5p, mir-17-5p, mir-4270, and mir-4441). The analyses revealed candidate blood based biomarkers in the AD. We evaluated the histone modifications of the identified biomolecules. The hub genes and transcription factors (TFs) revealed that they possess several histone modification sites associated with Alzheimers disease. The protein-drug interactions revealed 10 candidate drugs consisting of antineoplastic (Vinorelbine, Vincristine, Vinblastine, Epothilone D, Epothilone B, CYT997, and ZEN-012), dermatologicals (Podofilox), and immunosuppressive agents (Colchicine) that may target the candidate systems biomarkers. The subcellular localization analysis revealed the interactions of the DEGs range from nucleus to plasma membrane through cytosol.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study presents blood based systems molecular biomarker signatures at RNA and protein levels which might be useful as peripheral biomarkers in the AD. The candidate drugs, histone modification sites, and subcellular localizations will be useful in future drug design in the AD.",

    "abstract": "By shaping gene expression profiles, small RNAs (sRNAs) enable bacteria to very efficiently adapt to constant changes in their environment. To better understand how Escherichia coli acclimatizes to changes in nutrient availability, we performed UV cross-linking, ligation and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH) to uncover sRNA-target interactions. Strikingly, we uncovered hundreds of novel Hfq-mediated sRNA-target interactions at specific growth stages, involving many novel 3UTR-derived sRNAs and a plethora of sRNA-sRNA interactions. We discovered sRNA-target interaction networks that play a role in adaptation to changes in nutrient availability. We characterized a novel 3UTR-derived sRNA (MdoR), which is part of a regulatory cascade that enhances maltose uptake by (a) inactivating repressive pathways that block the accumulation of maltose transporters and (b) by reducing the flux of general porins to the outer membrane. Our work provides striking examples of how bacteria utilize sRNAs to integrate multiple regulatory pathways to enhance nutrient stress adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Data analysis for metabolomics is undergoing rapid progress thanks to the proliferation of novel tools and the standardization of existing workflows. However, as datasets and experiments continue to increase in size and complexity, standardized workflows are often not sufficient. In addition, as the ground truth for metabolomics experiments is intrinsically unknown, there is no way to critically evaluate the performance of tools. Here, we investigate the problem of dynamic multi-class metabolomics experiments using a simulated dataset with a known ground truth and evaluate the performance of tinderesting, a new and intuitive tool based on gathering expert knowledge to be used in machine learning, and compare it to EDGE, a statistical method for sequence data. This paper presents three novel outcomes. First we present a way to simulate dynamic metabolomics data with a known ground truth based on ordinary differential equations. This method is made available through the MetaboLouise R package. Second, we show that the EDGE tool, originally developed for genomics data analysis, is highly performant in analyzing dynamic case vs control metabolomics data. Last, we introduce the tinderesting method to analyse more complex dynamic metabolomics experiments that performs on par with statistical methods. This tool consists of a Shiny app for collecting expert knowledge, which in turn is used to train a machine learning model to emulate the decision process of the expert. This approach does not replace traditional data analysis workflows for metabolomics, but can provide additional information, improved performance or easier interpretation of results. The advantage is that the tool is agnostic to the complexity of the experiment, and thus is easier to use in advanced setups. All code for the presented analysis, MetaboLouise and tinderesting are freely available.",

    "abstract": "Symbiosis is a key driver of evolutionary novelty and ecological diversity, but our understanding of how macroevolutionary processes originate extant symbiotic associations is still very incomplete. Cophylogenetic tools are used to assess the congruence between the phylogenies of two groups of organisms related by extant associations. If phylogenetic congruence is higher than expected by chance, we conclude that there is cophylogenetic signal in the system under study. However, how to quantify cophylogenetic signal is still an open issue. We present a novel approach, Random Tanglegram Partitions (Random TaPas) that applies a given global-fit method to random partial tanglegrams of a fixed size to identify the associations, terminals and nodes that maximize phylogenetic congruence. By means of simulations, we show that the output value produced is inversely proportional to the number and proportion of cospeciation events employed to build simulated tanglegrams. In addition, with time-calibrated trees, Random TaPas is also efficient at distinguishing cospeciation from pseudocospeciation. Random TaPas can handle large tanglegrams in affordable computational time and incorporates phylogenetic uncertainty in the analyses. We demonstrate its application with two real examples: Passerine birds and their feather mites, and orchids and bee pollinators. In both systems, Random TaPas revealed low cophylogenetic signal, but mapping its variation onto the tanglegram pointed to two different coevolutionary processes. We suggest that the recursive partitioning of the tanglegram buffers the effect of phylogenetic nonindependence occurring in current global-fit methods and therefore Random TaPas is more reliable than regular global-fit methods to identify host-symbiont associations that contribute most to cophylogenetic signal. Random TaPas can be implemented in the public-domain statistical software R with scripts provided herein. A Users Guide is also available at GitHub.",

Evidence abounds of signalling environment driving the evolution of colours and sounds, but little is known about its influence upon gestural displays. Here, we performed a continent-wide phylogenetic comparative analysis to test the hypothesis that habitat structure drives the evolution of aerial sexual displays in passerine birds. We found that aerial displays are seven times more likely to evolve in open habitats than in forests, likely as a result of physical properties that allow aerial displays to transmit more broadly in open habitats. Our results provide an emblematic example of how environmental factors may help predict the direction of evolution of otherwise unpredictable sexual traits. The broader range of aerial displays in open habitats may also mean that females can sample more males, potentially leading to more intense sexual selection over open-habitat, aerial-displaying males.",

    "abstract": "The reactions of functional molecules like proteins and RNAs to mutation affect both host cell viability and biomolecular evolution. These molecules are considered robust if function is maintained despite mutations. Proteins and RNAs have different structural and functional characteristics that affect their robustness, and to date, comparisons between them have been theoretical. In this work, we test the relative mutational robustness of RNA and protein pairs using three approaches: evolutionary, structural, and functional. We compare the nucleotide diversities of functional RNAs with those of matched proteins. Across different levels of conservation, we found the nucleotide-level variations between the biomolecules largely overlapped, with proteins generally supporting more variation than matched RNAs. We then directly tested the robustness of the protein and RNA pairs with in vitro and in silico mutagenesis of their respective genes. The in silico experiments showed that proteins and RNAs reacted similarly to point mutations and insertions or deletions, yet proteins are slightly more robust on average than RNAs. In vitro, mutated fluorescent RNAs retained greater levels of function than the proteins. Overall this suggests that proteins and RNAs have remarkably similar degrees of robustness, with the average protein having moderately higher robustness than RNA as a group.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe ability of proteins and non-coding RNAs to maintain function despite mutations in their respective genes is known as mutational robustness. Robustness impacts how molecules maintain and change phenotypes, which has a bearing on the evolution and the origin of life as well as influencing modern biotechnology. Both protein and RNA have mechanisms that allow them to absorb DNA-level changes. Proteins have a redundant genetic code and non-coding RNAs can maintain structure and function through flexible base-pairing possibilities. The few theoretical treatments comparing protein and RNA robustness differ in their conclusions. In this experimental comparison of protein and RNA, we find that they have remarkably similar degrees of overall genetic robustness.",

To facilitate this transition, FDA proactively invested in tools to support innovation of emerging technologies. FDA and collaborators established a publicly available database, FDA dAtabase for Regulatory-Grade micrObial Sequences (FDA-ARGOS), as a tool to fill reference database gaps with quality-controlled genomes. This manuscript discusses quality control metrics for the proposed FDA-ARGOS genomic resource and outlines the need for quality-controlled genome gap filling in the public domain. Here, we also present three case studies showcasing potential applications for FDA-ARGOS in infectious disease diagnostics, specifically: assay design, reference database and in silico sequence comparison in combination with representative microbial organism wet lab testing; a novel composite validation strategy for ID-NGS diagnostics. The use of FDA-ARGOS as an in silico comparator tool could reduce the burden for completing ID-NGS clinical trials. In addition, use cases identifying Enterococcus avium and Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus variant Makona) demonstrate the utility of FDA-ARGOS as a reference database for independent performance validation of new tests and for documenting how one would use this database as an in silico sequence target comparator tool for ID-NGS validation, respectively.",
