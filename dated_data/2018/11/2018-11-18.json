    "abstract": "Depressive Rumination (DR), which involves a repetitive focus on ones distress, has been linked to alterations in functional connectivity of the  triple-network, consisting of Default-Mode, Salience, and Executive Control networks. A structural basis for these functional alterations that can dually explain DRs persistence as a stable trait remains unexplored, however. Using diffusion and functional MRI, we investigated multimodal relationships between DR severity, white-matter (WM) microstructure, and resting-state functional connectivity in depressed adults, and then directly replicated our results in a phenotypically-matched, independent sample (total N = 78). Among the fully-replicated findings, DR severity was associated with: (a) global microstructure of the right Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus and local microstructure of distributed primary-fiber and crossing-fiber WM; (b) a functional connectivity imbalance of segregation and integration within the triple-network; and (c)  multi-layer associations between these microstructural and functional connectivity biomarkers. Taken together, our results provide the first reproducible evidence for a multivariate microstructural-functional basis of rumination in the depressed brain.",

    "abstract": "Dominance is well defined in ethology, debated in psychology, and is often unclear among the dog owning public and in the press. However, to date, no study has examined how owners perceive dominance in dogs, and what different behaviours and personality types are used to describe dominant and subordinate individuals. A questionnaire study was launched to investigate the external validity of owner-derived estimates of dominance in dog dyads sharing the same household (N = 1151). According to the owners, dogs rated as dominant (87%) have priority access to resources (resting place, food, and rewards), undertake certain tasks (defend and lead the group, bark more), display dominance (win fights, lick the others mouth less, and mark over the others urine), share certain personality traits (smarter, more aggressive and impulsive), and are older than their partner dog (all p < 0.0001). An age-related hypothesis has been suggested to explain dominance in dogs, but we found that dog age did not explain the occurrence of dominance-related behaviours over the owners estimate of dominance status. Results suggest that owner-derived reports of dominance ranks of dogs living in multi-dog households correspond to ethologically valid behavioural markers of dominance. Size and physical condition were unrelated to the perceived dominance. Surprisingly, in mixed-sex dyads, females were more frequently rated as dominant than males, which might correspond to a higher proportion of neutered females in this subgroup. For future studies that wish to allocate dominance status using owner report, we offer a novel survey.",

    "abstract": "Animals readily execute learned motor behaviors in a consistent manner over long periods of time, yet similarly stable neural correlates remained elusive up to now. How does the cortex achieve this stable control? Using the sensorimotor system as a model of cortical processing, we investigated the hypothesis that the dynamics of neural latent activity, which capture the dominant co-variation patterns within the neural population, are preserved across time. We recorded from populations of neurons in premotor, primary motor, and somatosensory cortices for up to two years as monkeys performed a reaching task. Intriguingly, despite steady turnover in the recorded neurons, the low-dimensional latent dynamics remained stable. Such stability allowed reliable decoding of behavioral features for the entire timespan, while fixed decoders based on the recorded neural activity degraded substantially. We posit that latent cortical dynamics within the manifold are the fundamental and stable building blocks underlying consistent behavioral execution.",

However, it is unknown whether these associations represent causal relationships.\\n\\nObjectivesHere, we assess whether genetic predisposition to increased ASI is associated with elevated blood pressure and CAD risk.\\n\\nMethodsGenome-wide association analysis (GWAS) of finger photoplethysmography-derived ASI was performed in 131,686 participants from the UK Biobank. Across UK Biobank participants not in the ASI GWAS, a 6-variant ASI polygenic risk score was calculated. The ASI polygenic score was associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP, N=208,897), and with incident CAD over 10 years follow-up (N=223,061; 7,534 cases). The lack of CAD association observed was replicated among 184,305 participants (60,810 cases) from the Coronary Artery Disease Genetics Consortium (CARDIOGRAMplusC4D).\\n\\nResultsWe replicated prior reports of the epidemiologic association of ASI with SBP (Beta 0.55mmHg, [95% CI, 0.45-0.65], P=5.77x10-24), DBP (Beta 1.05mmHg, [95% CI, 0.99-1.11], P=7.27x10-272), and incident CAD (HR 1.08 [95% CI, 1.04-1.11], P=1.5x10-6) in multivariable models.

We tested whether genetic predisposition to increased ASI is associated with elevated blood pressure and CAD risk to assess whether these represent causal relationships. We find that a genetic predisposition to higher ASI is associated with elevated systolic (Beta 4.63 mmHg [95% CI, 2.1-7.2]) and diastolic blood pressures (Beta 2.61 mmHg [95% CI, 1.2-4.0]) in the UK Biobank, but not associated with incident CAD in the UK Biobank (P=0.75) or with prevalent CAD in CARDIOGRAMplusC4D (P=0.15). These data support a causal relationship of ASI with blood pressure but do not support the notion that ASI is a suitable surrogate for CAD risk.",

    "abstract": "Myosteatosis is the pathological accumulation of lipid that can occur in conjunction with atrophy and fibrosis following skeletal muscle injury. Little is known about the mechanisms by which lipid accumulates in myosteatosis, but many clinical studies have demonstrated the degree of lipid infiltration negatively correlates with muscle function and regeneration. Our objective was to determine the pathological changes that result in lipid accumulation in injured muscle fibers. We used a rat model of rotator cuff injury in this study, as the rotator cuff muscle group is particularly prone to the development of myosteatosis after injury. Muscles were collected from uninjured controls, or 10, 30, or 60 days after injury, and analyzed using a combination of muscle fiber contractility assessments, RNA sequencing, and undirected metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics, along with bioinformatics techniques, to identify potential pathways and cellular processes that are dysregulated after rotator cuff tear. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that mitochondrial function was likely disrupted after injury. Based on these findings, and given the role that mitochondria play in lipid metabolism, we then performed targeted biochemical and imaging studies and determined that mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced fatty acid oxidation likely leads to the accumulation of lipid in myosteatosis.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy comprises a wide spectrum of neuronal disorders and accounts for about one percent of global disease burden affecting people of all age groups. In the traditional medicinal system of Indian antiquity, commonly known as Ayurveda, epilepsy is recognised as apasmara and a plenty of information is documented regarding the effectiveness of various herbs against it. Towards exploring the complex regulatory mechanisms of Ayurvedic herbs at molecular levels, in this study, a network pharmacological framework is developed for thoroughly examining the anti-epileptic potential of 349 drug-like phytochemicals (DPCs) found in 63Ayurvedic herbs. Interaction networks of phytochemicals in anti-epileptic herbs, their protein targets and associated human pathways are designed at various scales and DPCs are mapped on these networks to uncover complex interrelationships. Neuromodulatory prospects of anti-epileptic herbs are probed and, as a special case study, DPCs that can regulate metabotrophic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are inspected. An account of novel regulatory phytochemicals against epilepsy is reported by systematically analysing the screened DPCs against DrugBank compounds. A repertoire of DPCs having poly-pharmacological similarity with anti-epileptic drugs available in DrugBank and those under clinical trials is also reported. Further, a high-confidence PPI network specific to the protein targets of epilepsy was developed and the potential of DPCs to regulate its functional modules was investigated. The study concludes by highlighting a couple of herbs as potential sources of epileptogenic regulators. We believe that the presented schema can open-up the exhaustive explorations of indigenous herbs towards meticulous identification of DPCs against various diseases and disorders.",

    "abstract": "MotivationConstraint-based modeling of metabolic networks helps researchers gain insight into the metabolic processes of many organisms, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Minimal Cut Sets (MCSs) are minimal sets of reactions whose inhibition blocks a target reaction in a metabolic network. Most approaches for finding the MCSs in constrained-based models require, either as an intermediate step or as a byproduct of the calculation, the computation of the set of elementary flux modes (EFMs), a convex basis for the valid flux vectors in the network. Recently, Ballerstein et al. [BvKKH11] proposed a method for computing the MCSs of a network without first computing its EFMs, by creating a dual network whose EFMs are a superset of the MCSs of the original network. However, their dual network is always larger than the original network and depends on the target reaction.\n\nHere we propose the construction of a different dual network, which is typically smaller than the original network and is independent of the target reaction, for the same purpose. We prove the correctness of our approach, MCS2, and describe how it can be modified to compute the few smallest MCSs for a given target reaction.\n\nResultsWe compare MCS2 to the method of Ballerstein et al. and two other existing methods. We show that MCS2 succeeds in calculating the full set of MCSs in many models where other approaches cannot finish within a reasonable amount of time. Thus, in addition to its theoretical novelty, our approach provides a practical advantage over existing methods.\n\nAvailabilityMCS2 is freely available at https://github.com/RezaMash/MCS under the GNU 3.0 license.",

    "abstract": "1Docking calculations can be used to accelerate drug discovery by providing predictions of the poses of candidate ligands bound to a targeted protein. However, studies in the literature use varied docking methods, and it is not clear which work best, either in general or for specific protein targets. In addition, a complete docking calculation requires components beyond the docking algorithm itself, such as preparation of the protein and ligand for calculations, and it is difficult to isolate which aspects of a method are most in need of improvement. To address such issues, we have developed the Continuous Evaluation of Ligand Protein Predictions (CELPP), a weekly blinded challenge for automated docking workflows. Participants in CELPP create a workflow to predict protein-ligand binding poses, which is then tasked with predicting 10-100 new (never before released) protein-ligand crystal structures each week. CELPP evaluates the accuracy of each workflows predictions and posts the scores online. CELPP is a new cyberinfrastructure resource to identify the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches, help map docking problems to the algorithms most likely to overcome them, and illuminate areas of unmet need in structure-guided drug design.",

    "abstract": "Whether new pancreatic beta-cells arise via pre-existing beta-cells or from differentiation of precursor cells - a question of fundamental importance for diabetic therapy - has long been debated. Recent experiments suggest that multipotent precursors from adult mouse pancreas, that give rise to beta-cells, do exist. However, such a finding is at odds with prior evidence that beta-cell expansions occurs exclusively through self-replication. Here we show that these two observations can be partially compatible. We use a systems biology approach to analyze the dynamics of the endogenous molecular-cellular network in the pancreas. Our results show that self-replicating  beta-cells can themselves be multipotent precursors. In addition, our model predicts heterogeneity in beta-cell regeneration and suggests various differentiation paths of precursors. This work therefore provides a means of reconciling an apparent contradiction in the field, but also sheds light on possible paths of beta-cell regeneration from a systems biology perspective.",

Meaningful in vitro models recapitulating the in vivo stem cell niche biology can be employed for both basic research as well as for applied sciences and represent a powerful tool to reduce animal tests in preclinical studies. Recently we published the generation of an in vitro bone marrow niche model, capable of long-term cultivation of HSC based on an organ-on-a-chip platform. This study provides a detailed analysis of the 3D culture system including matrix environment analysis by SEM, transcriptome analysis and system intrinsic differentiation induction. Furthermore, the bone marrow on a chip model can serve to multiply and harvest HSPC, since repeated cell removal not compromised the functionality of the culture system. The prolongation of the culture time to 8 weeks demonstrate the capacity to apply the model in repeated drug testing experiments. The quality of the presented system is emphasized by the differentiation capacity of long-term cultivated HSPC in vitro and in vivo. Transplanted human HSPC migrated actively into the bone marrow of irradiated mice and contributed to the long-term reconstitution of the hematopoietic system after four and eight weeks of in vitro cultivation.\\n\\nThe introduced system offers a multitude of possible applications to address a broad spectrum of questions regarding HSPC, the corresponding bone marrow niche biology, and pathological aberrations.",

In this study, we show that P. parasitica zoospores may form aggregates upon application of a K+ gradient in particular geometric arrangements. Based on the use of macro- and microfluidic devices, in addition to time-lapse live imaging both in the vertical and horizontal planes, we defined (i) the spatiotemporal and concentration scale evolution within the gradient in correlation with (ii) cell distribution and (iii) metrics of zoospore motion (velocity, trajectory). The results indicated that K+-induced aggregates result from a single bi-phasic temporal sequence involving negative chemotaxis and then bioconvection in a K+ gradient concentration scale [0-17 mM]. Each K+-sensing cell undergoes a forward-to-backward movement within a threshold range of 1-4mM, thereby forming progressively a swarm. Once a critical population density is achieved zoospores form a plume which undergoes a downward migration leading to aggregate formation on the support surface. We discuss putative sources for K+ gradient generation in natural environment (zoospore population, microbiota, plant roots, soil particles), and implication for events preceding inoculum formation on host plant.",

    "abstract": "The mutualistic symbiont Vibrio fischeri builds a symbiotic biofilm during colonization of squid hosts. Regulation of the exopolysaccharide component, termed Syp, has been examined in strain ES114, where production is controlled by a phosphorelay that includes the inner membrane hybrid histidine kinase RscS. Most strains that lack RscS or encode divergent RscS proteins cannot colonize a squid host unless RscS from a squid symbiont is heterologously expressed. In this study, we examine V. fischeri isolates worldwide to understand the landscape of biofilm regulation during beneficial colonization. We provide a detailed study of three distinct evolutionary groups of V. fischeri and find that while the RscS-Syp biofilm pathway is required in one of the groups, two other groups of squid symbionts require Syp independent of RscS. Mediterranean squid symbionts, including V. fischeri SR5, colonize without an RscS homolog encoded in their genome. Additionally, Group A V. fischeri strains, which form a tightly-related clade of Hawaii isolates, have a frameshift in rscS and do not require the gene for squid colonization or competitive fitness. These same strains have a frameshift in sypE, and we provide evidence that this Group A sypE allele leads to an upregulation in biofilm activity. This work thus describes the central importance of Syp biofilm in colonization of diverse isolates, and demonstrates that significant evolutionary transitions correspond to regulatory changes in the syp pathway.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBiofilms are surface-associated, matrix-encased bacterial aggregates that exhibit enhanced protection to antimicrobial agents. Previous work has established the importance of biofilm formation by a strain of luminous Vibrio fischeri bacteria as the bacteria colonize their host, the Hawaiian bobtail squid. In this study, expansion of this work to many natural isolates revealed that biofilm genes are universally required, yet there has been a shuffling of the regulators of those genes. This work provides evidence that even when bacterial behaviors are conserved, dynamic regulation of those behaviors can underlie evolution of the host colonization phenotype. Furthermore, this work emphasizes the importance of investigating natural diversity as we seek to understand molecular mechanisms in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "AT P -binding cassette (ABC) transporters are integral membrane proteins that translocate a wide range of substrates across biological membranes, harnessing free energy from the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. To understand the mechanism of the inward- to outward-facing transition that could be achieved by tight regulation of ATPase activity through extensive conformational changes of the protein, we applied template-based iterative all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to the heme ABC transporter BhuUV-T. The simulations, together with biased MDs, predict two new conformations of the protein, namely, occluded (Occ) and outward-facing (OF) conformations. The comparison between the inward-facing crystal structure and the predicted two structures shows atomic details of the gating motions at the transmembrane helices and dimerization of the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). The MD simulations further reveal a novel role of the ABC signature motifs (LSGG[Q/E]) at the NBDs in decelerating ATPase activity in the Occ form through sporadic flipping of the side chains of the LSGG[Q/E] catalytic serine residues. The orientational changes are coupled to loose NBD dimerization in the Occ state, whereas they are blocked in the OF form where the NBDs are tightly dimerized. The chemo-mechanical coupling mechanism may apply to other types of ABC transporters having the conserved LSGG[Q/E] signature motifs.",

    "abstract": "Semi-automated genome annotation (SAGA) methods are widely used to understand genome activity and gene regulation. These methods take as input a set of sequencing-based assays of epigenomic activity (such as ChIP-seq measurements of histone modification and transcription factor binding), and output an annotation of the genome that assigns a chromatin state label to each genomic position. Existing SAGA methods have several limitations caused by the discrete annotation framework: such annotations cannot easily represent varying strengths of genomic elements, and they cannot easily represent combinatorial elements that simultaneously exhibit multiple types of activity. To remedy these limitations, we propose an annotation strategy that instead outputs a vector of chromatin state features at each position rather than a single discrete label. Continuous modeling is common in other fields, such as in topic modeling of text documents. We propose a method, epigenome-ssm, that uses a Kalman filter state space model to efficiently annotate the genome with chromatin state features. We show that chromatin state features from epigenome-ssm are more useful for several downstream applications than both continuous and discrete alternatives, including their ability to identify expressed genes and enhancers. Therefore, we expect that these continuous chromatin state features will be valuable reference annotations to be used in visualization and downstream analysis.",

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid molecular biology and synthetic biology are undergoing rapid advances with the emergence of designer riboswitches controlling living cells, CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing, high-throughput RNA-based silencing, and reengineering of mRNA translation. Many of these efforts require the design of nucleic acid interactions, which relies on accurate models for DNA and RNA energetics. Existing models utilize nearest neighbor rules, which were parameterized through careful optical melting measurements. However, these relatively simple rules often fail to quantitatively account for the biophysical behavior of molecules even in vitro, let alone in vivo. This is due to the limited experimental throughput of optical melting experiments and the infinitely large space of possible motifs that can be formed. Here, we present a convolutional neural network architecture to model the energies of nucleic acid motifs, allowing for learning of representations of physical interactions that generalize to arbitrary unmeasured motifs. First, we used existing parameterizations of motif energies to train the model and demonstrate that our model is expressive enough to recapitulate the current model. Then, through training on optical melting datasets from the literature, we have shown that the model can accurately predict the thermodynamics of hairpins containing unmeasured motifs. This work demonstrates the utility of convolutional models for capturing the thermodynamic parameters that underlie nucleic acid interactions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSatellite repeats are a structural component of centromeres and telomeres, and in some instances their divergence is known to drive speciation. Due to their highly repetitive nature, satellite sequences have been understudied and underrepresented in genome assemblies. To investigate their turnover in great apes, we studied satellite repeats in human, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, and Sumatran and Bornean orangutans, using unassembled short and long sequencing reads.\\n\\nResultsThe density of satellite repeats, as identified from accurate short reads (Illumina), varied greatly among great ape genomes. These were dominated by a handful of abundant repeated motifs, frequently shared among species, which formed two groups: (1) the (AATGG)n repeat (critical for heat shock response) and its derivatives; and (2) subtelomeric 32-mers. Using the densities of abundant repeats, individuals could be classified into species. However clustering did not reproduce the accepted species phylogeny, suggesting rapid repeat evolution. Several abundant repeats were enriched in males vs. females; using existing Y chromosome assemblies or FIuorescent In Situ Hybridization, we validated location for some of them on the Y. Finally, applying a novel computational tool, we identified many satellite repeats completely embedded within long Oxford Nanopore and Pacific Biosciences reads. Such repeats were up to 59 kb in length and consisted of perfect repeats interspersed with other similar sequences.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results based on sequencing reads generated with three different technologies provide the first detailed characterization of great ape satellite repeats, and open new avenues for exploring their functions.",

The overlapping morphologic and immunohistochemical features of these lymphomas may pose diagnostic challenges in some cases, and a better understanding of potential diagnostic biomarkers and possible therapeutic targets is needed.

S1PRs are emerging as biomarkers in B cell biology and interaction between S1PR pathways and STAT3 or FOXP1 has been reported, especially in DLBCL. Our aim was to extend the understanding of the S1PR1, STAT3 and S1PR2, FOXP1 expression beyond DLBCL, into additional aggressive, mature B cell lymphomas such as BL, HGBL-DH and HGBL,NOS.\\n\\nHerein, we report that S1PR1 and S1PR2 showed different patterns of expression in mantle zones and follicle centers in reactive lymphoid tissue and, among the lymphomas in this study, Burkitt lymphomas showed a unique pattern of expression compared to HGBL and DLBCL.

Lastly, FOXP1 was expressed in a high proportion of the various case types and pSTAT3 was detected in a significant proportion of HGBL and DLBCL cases.

Since the BBB contributes to low success rate in CNS pharmacotherapy by restricting drug transportation, the development of an in vitro human BBB model has been in demand. Previous models were unable to fully represent the complex threedimensional (3D) anatomical structure or specific barrier phenotypes of the matured BBB. In this study, we present a physiological 3D microfluidic model of the human BBB that mimics its developmental process including CNS angiogenesis and subsequent maturation in concert with perivascular cells. We used microfluidic hydrogel patterning to precisely and sequentially load perivascular cells into the model, investigate the role of each cell type on BBB phenotypes. We confirmed the necessity of the tri-culture system (brain endothelium with pericytes and astrocytes) to attain the characteristic BBB vascular morphology such as minimized diameter and maximized junction expression. In addition, endothelial-perivascular cell interaction was also critical in reconstituting p-glycoprotein (p-gp), efflux transporter in our model that works as metabolic barrier of BBB and blocks drug to enter CNS. The 3D hydrogel matrix was tuned with hyaluronic acid (HA) to optimize the interaction between endothelial cells and astrocytes. Our in vitro BBB system mimics CNS angiogenesis and characteristic features of BBB. We expect the model will contribute to deeper understanding of neurodegenerative diseases and cost-efficient development of effective CNS medications.",

    "abstract": "The heterochromatin protein HP1 is proposed to enable chromatin compaction via liquid droplet formation. Yet, a connection between phase separation and chromatin compaction has not been experimentally demonstrated. More fundamentally, how HP1 action at the level of a single nucleosome drives chromatin compaction remains poorly understood. Here we directly demonstrate that the S. pombe HP1 protein, Swi6, compacts arrays of multiple nucleosomes into phase-separated droplets. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange, NMR, and mass-spectrometry, we further find that Swi6 substantially increases the accessibility and dynamics of buried histone residues within a mononucleosome. Restraining these dynamics via site-specific disulfide bonds impairs the compaction of nucleosome arrays into phase-separated droplets. Our results indicate that chromatin compaction and phase separation can be highly coupled processes. Further, we find that such coupling is promoted by a counter-intuitive function of Swi6, namely disorganization of the octamer core. Phase separation is canonically mediated by weak and dynamic multivalent interactions. We propose that dynamic exposure of buried histone residues increases opportunities for multivalent interactions between nucleosomes, thereby coupling chromatin compaction to phase separation. We anticipate that this new model for chromatin organization may more generally explain the formation of highly compacted chromatin assemblies beyond heterochromatin.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid zones occur as range boundaries for many animal taxa. One model for how hybrid zones form and are stabilized is the tension zone model. This model predicts that hybrid zones widths are determined by a a balance between random dispersal into hybrid zones and selection against hybrids, and it does not formally account for local ecological gradients. Given the models simplicity, it provides a useful starting point for examining variation in hybrid zone widths across animals. Here we examine whether random dispersal and a proxy for selection against hybrids (mtDNA distance) can explain variation in hybrid zone widths across 135 hybridizing taxon pairs. We show that dispersal explains >30% of hybrid zone width variation across animal diversity and that mtDNA distance explains little variation. Clade-specific analyses revealed idiosyncratic patterns. Dispersal and mtDNA distance predict hybrid zone widths especially well in reptiles, while hybrid zone width scaled positively with mtDNA distance in birds, opposite predictions. Lastly, the data suggest that lower bounds on hybrid zone widths may be set by dispersal and the extent of molecular divergence, suggesting that hybrid zones are unlikely to form in restricted geographic spaces in highly dispersive and/or recently diverged taxa. Overall, our analyses reinforce the fundamental importance of dispersal in hybrid zone formation, and more generally in the ecology of range boundaries.",

    "abstract": "The impact of direct interactions between co-resident microbes on microbiome composition is not well understood. Here we report the occurrence of acquired interbacterial defense (AID) gene clusters in bacterial residents of the human gut microbiome. These clusters encode arrays of immunity genes that protect against type VI secretion toxin-mediated intra- and inter-species bacterial antagonism. Moreover, the clusters reside on mobile elements and we demonstrate that their transfer is sufficient to confer toxin resistance in vitro and in gnotobiotic mice. Finally, we identify and validate the protective capacity of a recombinase-associated AID subtype (rAID-1) present broadly in Bacteroidales genomes. These rAID-1 gene clusters have a structure suggestive of active gene acquisition and include predicted immunity factors of toxins deriving from diverse organisms. Our data suggest that neutralization of contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism via AID systems shapes human gut microbiome ecology.",

    "abstract": "Although some circular RNAs (circRNAs) were found to be translated through IRES-driven mechanism, the scope and functions of circRNA translation are unclear because endogenous IRESs are rare. To determine the prevalence and mechanism of circRNA translation, we developed a cell-based system to screen random sequences and identified 97 overrepresented hexamers that drive cap-independent circRNA translation. These IRES-like short elements are significantly enriched in endogenous circRNAs and sufficient to drive circRNA translation. We further identified multiple trans-acting factors that bind these IRES-like elements to initiate translation. Using mass-spectrometry data, hundreds of circRNA-coded peptides were identified, most of which have low abundance due to rapid degradation. As judged by mass-spectrometry, 50% of translatable endogenous circRNAs undergo rolling circle translation, several of which were experimentally validated. Consistently, mutations of the IRES-like element in one circRNA reduced its translation. Collectively, our findings suggest a pervasive translation of circRNAs, providing profound implications in translation control.",

Specialized microscope control has been required to utilize AT as an imaging technique, which is often time consuming, and yields small volume data sets. Here we present MosaicPlanner, an open source software platform for light level AT, that streamlines the acquisition process and utilizes the general microscope control API provided by Micro-Manager, allowing AT data to be acquired on a wide variety of microscope hardware. This report provides a description of the MosaicPlanner software design, and platform improvements that were implemented to increase the acquisition speed of high volume, multiplexed AT datasets.",

    "abstract": "Sensory processing is increasingly conceived in a predictive framework in which neurons would constantly process the error signal resulting from the comparison of expected and observed stimuli. Surprisingly, few data exist on the amount of predictions that can be computed in real sensory scenes. Here, we focus on the sensory processing of auditory and audiovisual speech. We propose a set of computational models based on artificial neural networks (mixing deep feed-forward and convolutional networks) which are trained to predict future audio observations from 25 ms to 250 ms past audio or audiovisual observations (i.e. including lip movements). Experiments are conducted on the multispeaker NTCD-TIMIT audiovisual speech database. Predictions are efficient in a short temporal range (25-50 ms), predicting 40 to 60 % of the variance of the incoming stimulus, which could result in potentially saving up to 2/3 of the processing power. Then they quickly decrease to vanish after 100 ms. Adding information on the lips slightly improves predictions, with a 5 to 10 % increase in explained variance.\\n\\nInterestingly the visual gain vanishes more slowly, and the gain is maximum for a delay of 75 ms between image and predicted sound.",

    "abstract": "Pioneer transcription factors are coined as having the unique property of \"opening closed chromatin sites\" for implementation of cell fates. We previously showed that the pioneer Pax7 specifies melanotrope cells through deployment of an enhancer repertoire: this allows binding of Tpit, a nonpioneer factor that determines the related lineages of melanotropes and corticotropes. Here, we investigated the relation between these two factors in the pioneer mechanism. Cell-specific gene expression and chromatin landscapes were defined by scRNAseq and chromatin accessibility profiling. We found that in vivo deployment of the melanotrope enhancer repertoire and chromatin opening requires both Pax7 and Tpit. In cells, binding of heterochromatin targets by Pax7 is independent of Tpit but Pax7-dependent chromatin opening requires Tpit. The present work shows that pioneer core properties are limited to the ability to recognize heterochromatin targets and facilitate nonpioneer binding. Chromatin opening per se may be provided through cooperation with nonpioneer factors.",

    "abstract": "Protein acetylation is a widespread post-translational modification implicated in many cellular processes. Recent advances in mass spectrometry have enabled the cataloging of thousands of sites throughout the cell, however identifying regulatory acetylation marks have proven to be a daunting task. Knowledge of the kinetics and stoichiometry of site-specific acetylation are important factors to uncover function. Here, an improved method of quantifying acetylation stoichiometry was developed and validated, providing a detailed landscape of dynamic acetylation stoichiometry within cellular compartments. The dynamic nature of site-specific acetylation in response to serum stimulation was revealed. In two distinct human cell lines, growth factor stimulation led to site-specific, temporal acetylation changes, revealing diverse kinetic profiles that clustered into several groups. Overlap of dynamic acetylation sites among two different human cell lines suggested similar regulatory control points across major cellular pathways that include splicing, translation, and protein homeostasis. Rapid increases in acetylation on protein translational machinery suggest a positive regulatory role under pro-growth conditions. Lastly, higher median stoichiometry was observed in cellular compartments where active acetyltransferases are well-described.",
