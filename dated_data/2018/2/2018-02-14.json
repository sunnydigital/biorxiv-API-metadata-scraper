    "abstract": "If improvements are to be made in tuberculosis (TB) treatment, an increased understanding of disease in the lung is needed. Studies have shown that bacteria in a less metabolically active state, associated with the presence of lipid bodies, are less susceptible to antibiotics, and recent results have highlighted the disparity in concentration of different compounds into lesions. Treatment success therefore depends critically on the responses of the individual bacteria that constitute the infection.\\n\\nWe propose a hybrid, individual-based approach that analyses spatio-temporal dynamics at the cellular level, linking the behaviour of individual bacteria and host cells with the macroscopic behaviour of the microenvironment. The individual elements (bacteria, macrophages and T cells) are modelled using cellular automaton (CA) rules, and the evolution of oxygen, drugs and chemokine dynamics are incorporated in order to study the effects of the microenvironment in the pathological lesion. We allow bacteria to switch states depending on oxygen concentration, which affects how they respond to treatment. This is the first multiscale model of its type to consider both oxygen-driven phenotypic switching of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis and antibiotic treatment. Using this model, we investigate the role of bacterial cell state and of initial bacterial location on treatment outcome. We demonstrate that when bacteria are located further away from blood vessels, less favourable outcomes are more likely, i.e. longer time before infection is contained/cleared, treatment failure or later relapse. We also show that in cases where bacteria remain at the end of simulations, the organisms tend to be slower-growing and are often located within granulomas, surrounded by caseous material.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a Bayesian semi-supervised method for estimating cell counts from DNA methylation by leveraging an easily obtainable prior knowledge on the cell type composition distribution of the studied tissue. We show mathematically and empirically that alternative methods which attempt to infer explicit cell counts without methylation reference can only capture linear combinations of cell counts rather than provide one component per cell type. Our approach, which allows the construction of a set of components such that each component corresponds to a single cell type, therefore provides a new opportunity to investigate cell compositions in genomic studies of tissues for which it was not possible before.",

    "abstract": "Advances in genome engineering have resulted in the generation of numerous zebrafish mutant lines. A commonly used method to assess gene expression in the mutants is in situ hybridization (ISH). Because the embryos can be distinguished by genotype after ISH, comparing gene expression between wild type and mutant siblings can be done blinded and in parallel. Such experimental design reduces the technical variation between samples and minimises the risk of bias. This approach, however, requires an efficient method of genomic DNA extraction from post-ISH fixed zebrafish samples to ascribe phenotype to genotype. Here we describe a method to obtain PCR-quality DNA from 95-100% of zebrafish embryos, suitable for genotyping after ISH. In addition, we provide an image analysis protocol for quantifying gene expression of ISH-probed embryos, adaptable for the analysis of different expression patterns. Finally, we show that intensity-based image analysis enables accurate representation of the variability of gene expression detected by ISH and that it can complement quantitative methods like qRT-PCR. By combining genotyping after ISH and computer-based image analysis, we have established a high-confidence, unbiased methodology to assign gene expression levels to specific genotypes, and applied it to the analysis of molecular phenotypes of newly generated lmo4a mutants.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTOur optimized protocol to genotype zebrafish mutant embryos after in situ hybridization and digitally quantify the in situ signal will help to standardize existing experimental designs and methods of analysis.",

    "abstract": "During late mitosis and early G1, replication origins are licensed for replication by binding to double hexamers of MCM2-7. Here, we investigate how licensing and proliferative commitment are coupled in the small-intestinal epithelium. We developed a method for identifying cells in intact tissue containing DNA-bound MCM2-7. Interphase cells above the transit-amplifying compartment had no DNA-bound MCM2-7, but still expressed MCM2-7 protein, suggesting that licensing is inhibited immediately upon differentiation. Strikingly, we found most proliferative Lgr5(+) stem cells are in an unlicensed state. This suggests that the elongated cell-cycle of intestinal stem-cells is caused by an increased G1 length, characterised by dormant periods with unlicensed origins. Significantly, the unlicensed state is lost In Apc mutant epithelium, which lacks a functional restriction point, causing licensing immediately upon G1 entry. We propose that the unlicensed G1 of intestinal stem cells creates a temporal window when proliferative fate decisions can be made.",

However, little focus has been directed to the identification of maximum allowable turnaround times for IHC, which is necessary given the diversity of hospital settings in the world. Much less effort has been committed to the development of digital tools that allow hospital administrators to monitor service utilization histories of their patients.\\n\\nMethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed electronic and paper medical records of all suspected breast cancer patients treated at one secondary-care hospital of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS), located in western Mexico. We then followed three years of medical history of those patients with IHC testing.\\n\\nResultsIn 2014, there were 402 breast cancer patients, of which 30 were tested for some IHC biomarker (ER, PR, HER2). The subtyping allowed doctors to adjust (56.7 %) or confirm (43.3 %) the initial therapeutic regimen. The average turnaround time was 56 days. Opportune IHC testing was found to be beneficial when it was available before or during the first rounds of chemotherapy.\\n\\nConclusionsThe use of data mining tools applied to health record data revealed that there is an association between timely immunohistochemistry and improved outcomes in breast cancer patients. Based on this finding, inclusion of turnaround time in clinical guidelines is recommended.

    "abstract": "The microbiome has been implicated in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The specific traits of these diseases vary along the axis of the digestive tract. Further, variation in the structure of the gut microbiota has been associated with both diseases. Here we profiled the microbiota of the healthy proximal and distal mucosa and lumen to better understand how bacterial populations vary along the colon. We used a two-colonoscope approach to sample proximal and distal mucosal and luminal contents from the colons of 20 healthy subjects that had not undergone any bowel preparation procedure. The biopsies and home-collected stool were subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing and Random Forest classification models were built using taxa abundance and location to identify microbiota specific to each site. The right mucosa and lumen had the most similar community structures of the five sites we considered from each subject. The distal mucosa had higher relative abundance of Finegoldia, Murdochiella, Peptoniphilus, Porphyromonas and Anaerococcus. The proximal mucosa had more of the genera Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides and Pseudomonas. The classification model performed well when classifying mucosal samples into proximal or distal sides (AUC = 0.808). Separating proximal and distal luminal samples proved more challenging (AUC = 0.599) and specific microbiota that differentiated the two were hard to identify. By sampling the unprepped colon, we identified distinct bacterial populations native to the proximal and distal sides. Further investigation of these bacteria may elucidate if and how these groups contribute to different disease processes on their respective sides of the colon.",

    "abstract": "Despite accumulating evidence that evolution can be predictable, studies quantifying the predictability of evolution remain rare. Here, we measured the predictability of genome-wide evolutionary changes associated with a recent host shift in the Melissa blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa). We asked whether and to what extent genome-wide patterns of evolutionary change in nature could be predicted (1) by comparisons among instances of repeated evolution, and (2) from SNP x performance associations in a lab experiment. We delineated the genetic loci (SNPs) most strongly associated with host use in two L. melissa lineages that colonized alfalfa. Whereas most SNPs were strongly associated with host use in none or one of these lineages, we detected a ~two-fold excess of SNPs associated with host use in both lineages. Similarly, we found that host-associated SNPs in nature could also be partially predicted from SNP x performance (survival and weight) associations in a lab rearing experiment. But the extent of overlap, and thus degree of predictability, was somewhat reduced. Although we were able to predict (to a modest extent) the SNPs most strongly associated with host use in nature (in terms of parallelism and from the experiment), we had little to no ability to predict the direction of evolutionary change during the colonization of alfalfa. Our results show that different aspects of evolution associated with recent adaptation can be more or less predictable, and highlight how stochastic and deterministic processes interact to drive patterns of genome-wide evolutionary change.",

Thalamic neurogenesis occurs over a short period during mammalian embryonic development. These features have hampered the effort to understand how regionalization, cell divisions and fate specification are coordinated and produce a wide array of nuclei that exhibit distinct patterns of gene expression and functions. Here, we performed in vivo clonal analysis to track the divisions of individual progenitor cells and spatial allocation of their progeny in the developing mouse thalamus. Quantitative analysis of clone compositions revealed evidence for sequential generation of distinct sets of thalamic nuclei based on the location of the founder progenitor cells. Furthermore, we identified intermediate progenitor cells that produced neurons populating more than one thalamic nuclei, indicating a prolonged specification of nuclear fate. Our study reveals an organizational principle that governs the spatial and temporal progression of cell divisions and fate specification, and provides a framework for studying cellular heterogeneity and connectivity in the mammalian thalamus.",

    "abstract": "Streptomycetes constitute the largest genus of actinobacteria, living predominantly in soil and decaying vegetation. The bacteria are widely known for their filamentous morphologies and their capacity to synthesize antibiotics and other biologically active molecules. More than a decade ago, we and others identified 22 genomic islands that Streptomyces coelicolor M145 possesses and other Streptomyces strains lack. One of these genomic islands, Genomic Island (GI) 6, encodes an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor that we were characterizing in separate work. Here we report that artificial induction of the ECF sigma factor, which is encoded by SCO3450, causes the transcription of approximately one-fourth of GI 6, or ~26 mostly contiguous genes, to increase. More than half of the regulon encodes putative enzymes involved in small molecule metabolism. A putative haloacid dehalogenase is present. Genes encoding two putative anti-sigma factors flank SCO3450, the three genes residing within the regulon. Our data suggest that the ECF sigma factor and its regulon are a self-contained transcriptional unit that can be transferred by horizontal gene transfer. To our knowledge, only one other example has been identified of an ECF sigma factor and its contiguous regulon appearing to be transferrable by horizontal gene transfer [18,19]. Because the regulon appears not to be induced by the 44 growth conditions recently examined by Byung-Kwan Cho and colleagues [20], if it confers fitness to S. coelicolor, the regulon likely does so in as-yet unknown situations. Those situations might range from scavenging to detoxification to even communication within microbial communities.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEStreptomyces bacteria grow as hyphae that colonize soil and differentiate into spores when nutrients become scarce. In their terrestrial habitats, the bacteria encounter diverse conditions. Presumably so that the bacteria can cope with those conditions, the chromosomes of streptomycetes are highly dynamic, varying greatly in structure not only between species but also between closely related strains of a single species. The bacteria also have large numbers of extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors, which undoubtedly help the microorganisms respond to the plethora of challenges coming from the environment. This work illustrates these two threads of Streptomyces biology dovetailing: Genetic adaptability through horizontal gene transfer seems to have enabled Streptomyces coelicolor to acquire a self-contained transcriptional unit that consists of an ECF sigma factor and its regulon. The suggested facile movement of the regulon between microbial hosts indicates the value of the metabolism of small molecules possibly mediated by the regulon.",

Information divergence between methylation levels from different groups, measured in terms of Hellinger divergence, provides discrimination power between control and treatment samples.

    "abstract": "Corners rule predicts a positive correlation between leaf dimensions and the cross-sectional area of the primary stem. Although this relationship is usually explained by hydraulic and mechanical requirements, these hypotheses have never been tested empirically. However, Corners rule is tricky to investigate since rapid secondary growth of the stem prevents a rigorous link being established between a given leaf and the supporting stem. We chose a twig-like leaf model since petiole anatomy is only linked to the attached lamina. We tested the hypothesis that anatomical adjustments to hydraulic requirements related to vessel size enable reduced investment in tissue in the framework of Corners rule. We conducted a functional, mechanistic and intraspecific investigation of Cecropia obtusa Trecul, a Neotropical pioneer tree, by integrating morphological, anatomical and theoretical hydraulic traits around the lamina-petiole size relationship. The twig-like structure of the leaf and the strong lamina-petiole correlation of this model tree species made it possible to use the leaf-level model for a rigorous investigation of the functional implications of Corners rule. We found a positive correlation between petiole size, lamina size, the ratio of mean vessel area to vessel frequency in the petiole xylem and theoretical specific conductivity in the petiole xylem. Hydraulic function supports Corners rule to a lesser extent than previously thought. Variations in vessel dimensions mainly drive xylem hydraulic performances and avoid disproportionate petiole cross-sections to answer to hydraulic requirements associated with lamina size.",

Most of the ongoing research efforts regarding lncRNAs have focused on predicting their properties and their functions. Here, we aimed to extract the biological functions of lncRNAs referred in the biomedical literature. To this end, we performed gene enrichment tests for 417 verified gene names extracted from the scientific literature. We also succeeded in extracting biologically significant functions from 2455 single sentences of 2513 scientific abstracts retrieved from the PubMed digital library. These sentences had to be filtered to eliminate those that did not mention a biological function. They were also split into 2-3-grams and the meaningful function annotations based on Gene Ontology terms were extracted. The results provided by the gene enrichment test and the knowledge gained by automatic extraction of information from the scientific literature showed that lncRNAs play a critical role in all biological and cellular processes. Although simple natural language processing techniques fulfilled our purposes of extracting concepts concerning the biological functions of lncRNAs, in the future, we aim to use more sophisticated methods, such as grammatical rules, to extract more functions and to generate a full database for the biological functions related to lncRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the secondary structure of an RNA sequence with speed and accuracy is useful in many applications such as drug design. The state-of-the-art predictors have a fundamental limitation: they have a run time that scales cubically with the length of the input sequence, which is slow for longer RNAs and limits the use of secondary structure prediction in genome-wide applications. To address this bottleneck, we designed the first linear-time algorithm for this problem. which can be used with both thermodynamic and machine-learned scoring functions. Our algorithm, like previous work, is based on dynamic programming (DP), but with two crucial differences: (a) we incrementally process the sequence in a left-to-right rather than in a bottom-up fashion, and (b) because of this incremental processing, we can further employ beam search pruning to ensure linear run time in practice (with the cost of exact search). Even though our search is approximate, surprisingly, it results in even higher overall accuracy on a diverse database of sequences with known structures. More interestingly, it leads to significantly more accurate predictions on the longest sequence families in that database (16S and 23S Ribosomal RNAs), as well as improved accuracies for long-range base pairs (500+ nucleotides apart).",

Here we globally profiled chromatin accessibility in the retina and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) from AMD patients and controls. Global decreases in chromatin accessibility occurr in RPE in early AMD, and in the retina with advanced disease, suggesting that dysfunction in RPE cells drives disease progression. Footprints of photoreceptor and RPE-specific transcription factors are enriched in differentially accessible regions (DARs). Genes associated with DARs show altered expression in AMD. Cigarette smoke treatment of RPE cells recapitulates epigenomic changes seen in AMD, providing an epigenetic link between the known risk factors for AMD and AMD pathology.

    "abstract": "In tropical regions, fires propagate readily in grasslands but typically consume only edges of forest patches. Thus forest patches grow due to tree propagation and shrink by fires in surrounding grasslands. The interplay between these competing edge effects is unknown, but critical in determining the shape and stability of individual forest patches, as well the landscape-level spatial distribution and stability of forests. We analyze high-resolution remote-sensing data from protected areas of the Brazilian Cerrado and find that forest shapes obey a robust perimeter-area scaling relation across climatic zones. We explain this scaling by introducing a heterogeneous fire propagation model for tropical forest-grassland ecotones. Deviations from this perimeter-area relation determine the stability of individual forest patches. At a larger scale, our model predicts that the relative rates of tree growth due to propagative expansion and long-distance seed dispersal determine whether collapse of regional-scale tree cover is continuous or discontinuous as fire frequency changes.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we assessed invasions of Psittaciformes in Puerto Rico. We reviewed the literature, public databases, citizen science records, and performed in situ population surveys across the island to determine the historical and current status and distribution of psittacine species. We used count data from Ebird to determine population trends. For species whose populations were increasing, we modelled their potential distribution using niche modeling techniques. Focusing on the white-winged parakeet (Brotogeris versicolurus), which was considered the most successful psittacine species by the year 2000, we evaluated the population size, calculated growth rates and estimated the breeding proportion in two populations by performing roost counts for four consecutive years. We found a total of 46 Psittaciformes present in Puerto Rico, of which 26% are only present as pets, at least 29 species have been reported in the wild, and of those, there is evidence that at least 12 species are breeding. Our results indicate that most introduced species which have been detected as established still persist, although mostly in localized areas and small populations. Clear evidence of invasiveness was found for B. versicolurus and Myiopsitta monachus, which have greatly expanded their range. Moreover, Psittacara erythrogenys and Eupsittacula canicularis also showed population increase. The niche models predicted suitable areas for the four species, and also indicate the potential for range expansion. Population estimates of the white-winged parakeet during the study period showed a steady increase, and exhibited exponential growth, with geometric mean population growth rates of 1.25 per year. Currently growth rate of the white-winged parakeet does not appear to be limited by any predator, resources or nest availability, and we expect them to continue increasing and expanding their range. We discuss the factors leading to invasion success, assess the potential impacts, and we discuss possible management strategies and research prospects.",

    "abstract": "Metabarcoding of lake sediments may reveal current and past biodiversity, but little is known about the degree to which taxa growing in the vegetation are represented in environmental DNA (eDNA) records. We analysed composition of lake and catchment vegetation and vascular plant eDNA at 11 lakes in northern Norway. Out of 489 records of taxa growing within 2 m from the lake shore, 17-49% (mean 31%) of the identifiable taxa recorded were detected with eDNA. Of the 217 eDNA records, 73% and 12% matched taxa recorded in vegetation surveys within 2 m and up to about 50 m away from the lakeshore, respectively, whereas 16% were not recorded in the vegetation surveys of the same lake. The latter include taxa likely overlooked in the vegetation surveys or growing outside the survey area. The percentages detected were 61, 47, 25, and 15 for dominant, common, scattered, and rare taxa, respectively. Similar numbers for aquatic plants were 88, 88, 33 and 62%, respectively. Detection rate and taxonomic resolution varied among plant families and functional groups with good detection of e.g. Ericaceae, Roseaceae, deciduous trees, ferns, club mosses and aquatics. The representation of terrestrial taxa in eDNA depends on both their distance from the sampling site and their abundance and is sufficient for recording vegetation types. For aquatic vegetation, eDNA may be comparable with, or even superior to, in-lake vegetation surveys and therefore be used as an tool for biomonitoring. For reconstruction of terrestrial vegetation, technical improvements and more intensive sampling is needed to detect a higher proportion of rare taxa although DNA of some taxa may never reach the lake sediments due to taphonomical constrains. Nevertheless, eDNA performs similar to conventional methods of pollen and macrofossil analyses and may therefore be an important tool for reconstruction of past vegetation.",

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a complex and serious eating disorder, occurring in ~1% of individuals. Despite having the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder, little is known about the aetiology of AN, and few effective treatments exist.\\n\\nGlobal efforts to collect large sample sizes of individuals with AN have been highly successful, and a recent study consequently identified the first genome-wide significant locus involved in AN. This result, coupled with other recent studies and epidemiological evidence, suggest that previous characterizations of AN as a purely psychiatric disorder are over-simplified. Rather, both neurological and metabolic pathways may also be involved.\\n\\nIn order to elucidate more of the system-specific aetiology of AN, we applied transcriptomic imputation methods to 3,495 cases and 10,982 controls, collected by the Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-ED). Transcriptomic Imputation (TI) methods approaches use machine-learning methods to impute tissue-specific gene expression from large genotype data using curated eQTL reference panels. These offer an exciting opportunity to compare gene associations across neurological and metabolic tissues. Here, we applied CommonMind Consortium (CMC) and GTEx-derived gene expression prediction models for 13 brain tissues and 12 tissues with potential metabolic involvement (adipose, adrenal gland, 2 colon, 3 esophagus, liver, pancreas, small intestine, spleen, stomach).\\n\\nWe identified 35 significant gene-tissue associations within the large chromosome 12 region described in the recent PGC-ED GWAS. We applied forward stepwise conditional analyses and FINEMAP to associations within this locus to identify putatively causal signals. We identified four independently associated genes; RPS26, C12orf49, SUOX, and RDH16. We also identified two further genome-wide significant gene-tissue associations, both in brain tissues; REEP5, in the dorso-lateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC; p=8.52x10-07), and CUL3, in the caudate basal ganglia (p=1.8x10-06). These genes are significantly enriched for associations with anthropometric phenotypes in the UK BioBank, as well as multiple psychiatric, addiction, and appetite/satiety pathways. Our results support a model of AN risk influenced by both metabolic and psychiatric factors.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease. It is crucial to identify the key driver genes and their role in cancer mechanisms with attention to different cancer stages, types or subtypes. Cancer driver genes are elusive and their discovery is complicated by the fact that the same gene can play a diverse role in different contexts. Key biological processes, such as cell proliferation and cell death, have been linked to cancer progression. Thus, in principle, they can be exploited to classify the cancer genes and unveil their role. Here, we present a new method, Moonlight, that exploit expression data to classify cancer genes. Moonlight relies on the integration of functional enrichment analysis, gene regulatory networks and upstream regulator analysis from expression data to score the importance of biological cancer-related processes taking into account either the inter- or intra-tumor heterogeneity. We then employed these scores to predict if each gene acts as a tumor suppressor gene (TSG) or as an oncogene (OCG). Our methodology also allow to predict genes with dual role, i.e. the moonlight genes (TSG in one cancer type or stage and OCG in another), as well as to elucidate the underlying biological processes.

Advances in deep learning that replace complex, human-designed pipelines with differentiable models optimized end-to-end suggest the potential benefits of similarly reformulating structure prediction. Here we report the first end-to-end differentiable model of protein structure. The model couples local and global protein structure via geometric units that optimize global geometry without violating local covalent chemistry. We test our model using two challenging tasks: predicting novel folds without co-evolutionary data and predicting known folds without structural templates. In the first task the model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and in the second it comes within 1-2[A]; competing methods using co-evolution and experimental templates have been refined over many years and it is likely that the differentiable approach has substantial room for further improvement, with applications ranging from drug discovery to protein design.",

The epithelium of the vomeronasal organ of mice contains two major types of vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs): 1) the apical VSNs which express vomeronasal 1 receptors (V1r) and the G-protein subunit Gi2 and; 2) the basal VSNs which express vomeronasal 2 receptors (V2r) and the G-protein subunit Gao. Both cell types originate from a common pool of progenitors and eventually acquire apical or basal identity through largely unknown mechanisms.\\n\\nThe transcription factor AP-2{varepsilon}, encoded by the Tfap2e gene, plays a role in controlling the development of GABAergic interneurons in the main and accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), moreover AP-2{varepsilon} has been previously described to be expressed in the VSNs. Here we show that AP-2{varepsilon} is expressed in postmitotic VSNs after they commit to the basal differentiation program. Loss of AP-2{varepsilon} function resulted in reduced number of basal VSNs and in an increased number of neurons expressing markers of the apical lineage. Our work suggests that AP-2{varepsilon}, which is expressed in late phases of differentiation, is not needed to initiate the apical-basal differentiation dichotomy but for maintaining the basal VSNs identity by preventing the expression of apical genes. Moreover, our data suggest that differentiated VSNs of mice retain a notable level of plasticity.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThe VNO contains two major cell types that are segregated in apical and basal regions of the VNO\\nC_LIO_LIAP-2{varepsilon} is expressed in postmitotic basal vomeronasal sensory neurons.\\nC_LIO_LIAP-2{varepsilon} is essential to maintain the identity of basal vomeronasal sensory neurons.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Ecological communities are comprised of both species and the biotic relationships among them. Biotic homogenization in species composition (i.e. increased site-to-site similarity) is recognized a common consequence of global change, but less is known about how species relationships change over space and time. Does homogenization of species composition lead to homogenization of species relationships or are the dynamics of species relationships decoupled from changes in species composition? To answer this question, we used long-term resurvey data to analyze changes in plant species association patterns between the 1950s and 2000s at 266 sites distributed among three community types in Wisconsin, USA. We used species associations (quantified via local co-occurrence patterns) as a proxy for species relationships. Species pairs that co-occur more/less than expected by chance have positive/negative associations. Shifts in species associations consistently exceeded the shifts observed in species composition. Less disturbed forests of northern Wisconsin have converged somewhat in species composition but not much in species associations. In contrast, forests in central Wisconsin succeeding from pine barrens to closed-canopy forests have strongly homogenized in both species composition and species associations. More fragmented forests in southern Wisconsin also tended to converge in species composition and in the species negative associations, but their positive associations diverged over the last half century. We conclude that long-term shifts in species relationships may be decoupled from those of species composition despite being affected by similar environmental variables.",

    "abstract": "An individual's body size is central to its behavior and physiology, and tightly linked to its dispersal ability. The spatial arrangement of resources and a consumer's capacity to locate them are therefore expected to exert strong selection on consumer body size.\\n\\nWe investigated the evolutionary impact of both the fragmentation and loss of habitat on consumer body size and its feedback effects on resource distribution, under varying levels of information use during the settlement phase of dispersal. We developed a mechanistic, individual-based, spatially explicit model, including several allometric rules for key consumer traits. Our model reveals that as resources become more fragmented and scarce, informed settlement selects for larger body sizes while random settlement promotes small sizes. Information use may thus be an overlooked explanation for the observed variation in body size responses to habitat fragmentation. Moreover, we find that resources can accumulate and aggregate if information on resource abundance is incomplete. Informed movement results in stable resource-consumer dynamics and controlled resources across space. However, habitat fragmentation and loss destabilize local dynamics and disturb resource suppression by the consumer. Considering information use during movement is thus critical to understand the eco-evolutionary dynamics underlying the functioning and structuring of consumer communities.",

    "abstract": "Body size is a fundamental trait known to allometrically scale with metabolic rate, and therefore a key determinant of individual development, life history and consequently fitness. In spatially structured environments, movement is an equally important driver of fitness. Because movement is tightly coupled with body size, we expect habitat fragmentation to induce a strong selection pressure on size variation across and within species. Changes in body size distributions are then, in turn, expected to alter food web dynamics. However, no consensus has been reached on how spatial isolation and resource growth affect body size distributions.\\n\\nOur aim was to investigate how these two factors shape the body size distribution of consumers under scenarios of size-dependent and -independent consumer movement by applying a mechanistic, individual-based resource-consumer model. The outcome was then linked to important ecosystem traits such as resource abundance and stability. Finally, we determined those factors that explain most variation in size distributions.\\n\\nWe demonstrate that decreasing connectivity and resource growth select for communities (or populations) consisting of larger species (or individuals) due to strong selection for the ability to move over longer distances. When including size-dependent movement, moderate levels of connectivity result in increases in local size diversity. Due to this elevated functional diversity, resource uptake is optimized at the metapopulation or metacommunity level. At these intermediate levels of connectivity, size-dependent movement explains most of the observed variation in size distributions. Interestingly, local and spatial stability of consumer biomass are lowest when isolation and resource productivity are high. Finally, we highlight that size-dependent movement is of vital importance for the survival of populations within highly fragmented landscapes. Our results demonstrate that considering size-dependent movement and resource growth is essential to understand patterns of size distributions at the population or community level and the resulting metapopulation or metacommunity dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Reproduction is well known to be costly for females, but longevity costs of copulations in males are still poorly understood. In particular, the effect of the number of copulations on male longevity is rarely considered. Work on black scavenger flies (Diptera: Sepsidae) showed contrasting results: in Saltella sphondylii the number of copulations is strongly negatively correlated with male longevity, whereas in Sepsis cynipsea mated males did not suffer from reduced longevity. Here we summarize the findings of several studies covering four additional species of sepsid flies from across the phylogenetic tree of sepsids to better understand the evolution of male reproductive costs in this clade. After accounting for the mating system differences between species, we find no evidence for longevity costs in Allosepsis sp., Sepsis fulgens and Themira superba, while in Saltella nigripes multiple copulations drastically reduced longevity. Mapping this trait onto the most current phylogenetic hypothesis for Sepsidae suggests that male cost in Saltella is derived while there is an absence of longevity costs for all other sepsids. We discuss the origin of this novel longevity cost in Saltella in the context of a change in their reproductive strategy, namely the evolution of high polygynandry coupled with unusually brief copulations.",

    "abstract": "Culture is humanitys prime adaptation. Which cultural traits contribute to adaptive value at the level of cultural groups, and how they do so, is, however, unclear and debated. Here, we apply an approach from systems biology, known as Pareto task inference (ParTI), to bring a fresh perspective to these questions. ParTI considers systems that need to perform multiple tasks. No system can be optimal at all tasks at once, leading to a fundamental tradeoff. These tradeoffs result in specific patterns in multivariate trait data: data falls inside polygons in trait space, whose vertices are trait combinations that are adaptive for each of the tasks. ParTI can infer the number of adaptive tasks and their nature without need for a-priori assumptions, based on the vertices of these polygons. Here, we applied ParTI to two datasets of cultural traits, on Austronesian cultures and modern hunter-gatherers, adjusting for phylogeny and spatial diffusion effects. We find evidence that these independent datasets show a tradeoff between the same three tasks. We identify the tasks as resource defense, resource competition, and mobility/exchange. Specific combinations of cultural traits are adaptive for each of these tasks. This approach can be widely applied to any large multivariate dataset to study trade-offs in cultural evolution.",

However, the interplay of stochastic and contingent factors influencing the extent of parallelism in nature is not well understood. To test the predictability of evolution, we studied a  natural experiment on different organismal levels across lakes and evolutionary lineages of a freshwater salmonid fish, Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). We identified significant phenotypic parallelism between Arctic charr ecotype pairs within a continuum of parallel evolution and highly parallel adaptive morphological traits. Variability in phenotypic predictability was explained by complex demographic histories, differing genomic backgrounds and genomic responses to selection, variable genetic associations with ecotype, and environmental variation. Remarkably, gene expression was highly similar across ecotype replicates, and explained the observed parallelism continuum. Our findings suggest that parallel evolution by non-parallel evolutionary routes is possible when the regulatory molecular phenotype compensates for divergent histories.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGene and genome duplication play important roles in the evolution of gene function. Compared to individual duplicated genes, gene clusters attract particular attentions considering their frequent associations with innovation and adaptation. Here, we report for the first time the expansion of the ligand (e.g., pheromone and hormone)-transporter genes, apolipoprotein D (ApoD) genes in a cluster, specific to teleost fishes.\\n\\nResultsThe single ApoD gene in the ancestor expands in two clusters with a dynamic evolutionary pattern in teleost fishes. Based on comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses, protein 3D structure comparison, evolutionary rate detection and breakpoint detection, orthologous genes show conserved expression patterns. Lineage-specific duplicated genes that are under positive selection evolved specific and even new expression profiles. Different duplicates show high tissue-specific expression patterns (e.g., skin, eye, anal fin pigmentation patterns, gonads, gills, spleen and lower pharyngeal jaw). Cluster analyses based on protein 3D structure comparisons, especially the four loops at the opening side, show segregation patterns with different duplicates. Duplicated ApoD genes are predicted to be associated with forkhead transcription factors and MAPK genes, and they are located next to the breakpoints of genome rearrangements.\\n\\nConclusionsHere, we report the expansion of ApoD genes specific to teleost fishes in a cluster manner for the first time. Neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization were observed at both protein and expression levels after duplication. Evidence from different aspects, i.e. abnormal expression induced disease in human, fish-specific expansion, predicted associations with forkhead transcription factors and MAPK genes, highly specific expression patterns in tissues related to sexual selection and adaptation, duplicated genes that are under positive selection, and their locations next to breakpoints of genome rearrangement, suggests the potential advantageous roles of ApoD genes in teleost fishes. Cluster expansion of ApoD genes specific to teleost fishes thus provides an ideal evo-devo model for studying gene duplication, cluster maintenance and new gene function emergence.",

    "abstract": "Binge eating (BE) is a heritable trait associated with eating disorders and involves rapid consumption of large quantities of food. We identified cytoplasmic FMRP-interacting protein 2 (Cyfip2) as a major genetic factor underlying BE and concomitant compulsive-like behaviors in mice. CYFIP2 is a gene homolog of CYFIP1 - one of four paternally-deleted genes in patients with the more severe Type I Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). PWS is a neurodevelopmental disorder where 70% of cases involve paternal deletion of 15q11-q13. PWS symptoms include hyperphagia, obesity (if untreated), cognitive deficits, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors. We tested whether Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency (+/-) would enhance premorbid compulsive-like behavior and palatable food (PF) intake in a parent-of-origin-selective manner. We tested Cyfip1+/- mice on a C57BL/6N (N) background that were homozygous for the BE-associated missense mutation in Cyfip2 (S968F) as well as mice that we backcrossed to homozygosity for the C57BL/6J (J) allele at Cyfip2 (Cyfip2J/J). Cyfip1+/- mice showed increased compulsive-like behavior on both backgrounds, increased PF consumption on the Cyfip2N/N background in a paternally-enhanced manner, and decreased PF consumption in male Cyfip1+/- mice on the Cyfip2J/J background in a maternally selective manner. In the hypothalamus, there was a maternally-enhanced reduction of Cyfip1 transcription, but a paternally-enhanced reduction in CYFIP1 protein. In the nucleus accumbens, there was a maternally-enhanced reduction in CYFIP1 protein. Together, increased compulsive-like behavior, parent-of-origin-, and genetic background-dependent effects of Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency on PF consumption implicate CYFIP1 in behaviors in neurodevelopmental disorders involving reduced expression of CYFIP1, including PWS, Fragile X Syndrome, and 15q11.2 Microdeletion Syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus mutans displays complex regulation of natural genetic competence. Competence development in S. mutans is controlled by a peptide derived from ComS (XIP); which along with the cytosolic regulator ComR controls the expression of the alternative sigma factor comX, the master regulator of competence development. Recently, a gene embedded within the coding region of comX was discovered and designated xrpA (comX regulatory peptide A). XrpA was found to be an antagonist of ComX, but the mechanism was not established. In this study, we reveal through both genomic and proteomic techniques that XrpA is the first describe negative regulator of ComRS systems in streptococci. Transcriptomic and promoter activity assays in the {Delta}xrpA strain revealed an up-regulation of genes controlled by both the ComR- and ComX-regulons. An in vivo protein crosslinking and in vitro fluorescent polarization assays confirmed that the N-terminal region of XrpA were found to be sufficient in inhibiting ComR-XIP complex binding to ECom-box located within the comX promoter. This inhibitory activity was sufficient for decreases in PcomX activity, transformability and ComX accumulation. XrpA serving as a modulator of ComRS activity ultimately results in changes to subpopulation behaviors and cell fate during competence activation.\\n\\nABBREVIATED SUMMARYStreptococcus mutans displays complex regulation of natural genetic competence, highlighted by a novel gene, xrpA, embedded within the coding region for the master regulator ComX. We show that XrpA modulates ComRS-dependent activation of comX expression, resulting in changes to sub-population behaviors, including cell lysis. XrpA is the first described inhibitor of a ComRS system and, because it is unique to S. mutans it may be targetable to prevent diseases caused by this pathogen.",

Parasite cytosolic Ca2+ signalling activates motility, but how this is switched off after invasion is not understood. Here we show that the cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase A catalytic subunit 1 (PKAc1) of Toxoplasma is responsible for suppression of Ca2+ signalling upon host cell invasion. We demonstrate that that PKAc1 is sequestered to the parasite periphery by dual acylation of its regulatory subunit PKAr1. Newly invaded PKAc1-deficient parasites exit host cells shortly thereafter in a perforin-like protein 1 (PLP-1)-dependent fashion. We demonstrate that loss of PKAc1 results in an inability to rapidly downregulate cytosolic Ca2+ levels shortly after invasion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PKAc1 also specifically negatively regulates resting cytosolic Ca2+ in conditions that mimic intracellularity. We also show that cAMP and cGMP have opposing role in microneme secretion, further supporting evidence that cAMP signalling has a suppressive role during motility. Together, this work provides a new paradigm in understanding how Toxoplasma and related apicomplexan parasites regulate infectivity.",

    "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne human pathogen, causes a disabling disease characterized by severe joint pain that can persist for weeks, months or even years in patients. The non-structural protein 3 (nsP3) plays essential roles during acute infection, but little is known about the function of nsP3 during chronic disease. Here, we used sub-diffraction multi-color microscopy for a spatial and temporal analysis of CHIKV nsP3 within human cells that persistently replicate viral RNA. Round cytoplasmic granules of various sizes (i) contained nsP3 and G3BP Stress Granule Assembly factor; (ii) were next to double-stranded RNA foci, and nsP1-positive structures; and (iii) made contact with markers of the cytoskeleton and cellular structures, such as early endosomes and nucleopores. Analysis of protein turnover and mobility by live-cell microscopy revealed that granules could persist for hours to days, can accumulate newly synthesized protein, and move at differently through the cytoplasm. Granules also had a static internal architecture and were stable in cell lysates. Whereas cells with active replication and stable nsP3-granules did not respond to oxidative stress, refractory cells that had cleared the non-cytotoxic replicon could. In summary, nsP3 can form uniquely stable granular structures that persist long-term within the host cell. This continued presence of viral and cellular protein-complexes has implications for the study of the pathogenic consequences of lingering CHIKV infection and the development of strategies to mitigate the burden of chronic musculoskeletal disease brought about by a medically important arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus).\\n\\nImportanceChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging alphavirus transmitted by mosquitos and causes widespread transient sickness but also chronic disease affecting muscles and joints. Although no approved vaccines or antivirals are available, a better understanding of the viral life cycle and the role of individual viral proteins can aid in identifying new therapeutic targets. Advances in microscopy and persistent CHIKV model systems now allow researchers to study viral proteins within controlled laboratory environments. Here we established human cells that stably replicate viral RNA and express a tagged version of non-structural protein 3. The ability to track this viral protein within the host cell and during persistent replication can benefit fundamental research efforts to better understand long-term consequences of the persistence of viral protein complexes and thereby provide the foundation for new therapeutic targets to control CHIKV infection and treat chronic disease symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis is the deadliest infectious disease worldwide. Although the BCG vaccine is widely used, it does not efficiently protect against pulmonary tuberculosis and an improved tuberculosis vaccine is therefore urgently needed. Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses different ESX/Type VII secretion (T7S) systems to transport proteins important for virulence and host immune responses. We recently reported that secretion of T7S substrates belonging to the mycobacteria-specific Pro-Glu (PE) and Pro-Pro-Glu (PPE) proteins of the PGRS (polymorphic GC-rich sequences) and MPTR (major polymorphic tandem repeat) subfamilies required both a functional ESX-5 system and a functional PPE38/71 protein for secretion. Inactivation of ppe38/71 and the resulting loss of PE_PGRS/PPE-MPTR secretion were linked to increased virulence of M. tuberculosis strains. Here, we show that a predicted total of 89 PE_PGRS/PPE-MPTR surface proteins are not exported by certain animal-adapted strains of the M. tuberculosis complex including M. bovis. This {Delta}ppe38/71-associated secretion defect therefore also occurs in the M. bovis-derived tuberculosis vaccine BCG and could be restored by introduction of the M. tuberculosis ppe38-locus. Epitope mapping of the PPE-MPTR protein PPE10, further allowed us to monitor T-cell responses in splenocytes from BCG/M. tuberculosis immunized mice, confirming the dependence of PPE10-specific immune-induction on ESX-5/PPE38-mediated secretion. Restoration of PE_PGRS/PPE-MPTR secretion in recombinant BCG neither altered global antigenic presentation or activation of innate immune cells, nor protective efficacy in two different mouse vaccination-infection models. This unexpected finding stimulates a reassessment of the immunomodulatory properties of PE_PGRS/PPE-MPTR proteins, some of which are contained in vaccine formulations currently in clinical evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Through selective attention, decision-makers can learn to ignore behaviorally-irrelevant stimulus dimensions. This can improve learning and increase the perceptual discriminability of relevant stimulus information. To account for this effect, popular contemporary cognitive models of categorization typically include of attentional parameters, which provide information about the importance of each stimulus dimension in decision-making. The effect of these parameters on psychological representation is often described geometrically, such that perceptual differences over relevant psychological dimensions are accentuated (or stretched), and differences over irrelevant dimensions are down-weighted (or compressed). In sensory and association cortex, representations of stimulus features are known to covary with their behavioral relevance. Although this implies that neural representational space might closely resemble that hypothesized by formal categorization theory, to date, attentional effects in the brain have been demonstrated through powerful experimental manipulations (e.g., contrasts between relevant and irrelevant features). This approach sidesteps the role of idiosyncratic conceptual knowledge in guiding attention to useful information sources. To bridge this divide, we used formal categorization models, which were fit to behavioral data, to make inferences about the concepts and strategies used by individual participants during decision-making. We found that when greater attentional weight was devoted to a particular visual feature (e.g., \\\"color\\\"), its value (e.g., \\\"red\\\") was more accurately decoded from occipitotemporal cortex. We additionally found that this effect was sufficiently sensitive to reflect individual differences in conceptual knowledge. The results indicate that occipitotemporal stimulus representations are embedded within a space closely resembling that proposed by classic categorization models.",

A support vector regression model was trained on two independent datasets of healthy adults across the adult life-span (n=765, Cam-CAN = 588; UiO = 177) to predict participant age from DTI metrics, and applied to the HIV dataset. Predicted brain age gap (BAG) was computed as the difference between predicted age and chronological age, and statistically compared between HIV groups. Regressions assessed the relationship between BAG and HIV severity/medical comorbidities. Finally, correlation analyses tested for associations between BAG and cognitive performance.\\n\\nResultsBAG was significantly higher in the HIV+ group than the HIV-group F (1, 103) = 12.408, p = 0.001).

    "abstract": "Our confidence in a choice and the evidence pertaining to a choice appear to be inseparable. An emerging computational consensus is, however, that the brain should maintain separate estimates of these quantities for adaptive behavioural control. Here we devised a psychophysical task to decouple confidence in a perceptual decision from both the reliability of sensory evidence and the relation of such evidence with respect to a choice boundary. Using human fMRI, we found that an area in medial prefrontal cortex (perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, pgACC) tracked expected performance, an aggregate signature of decision confidence, whereas neural areas previously proposed to encode decision confidence instead tracked sensory reliability (posterior parietal cortex and ventral striatum) or boundary distance (pre-supplementary motor area). Supporting that information encoded by pgACC is central to a subjective sense of decision confidence, we show that pgACC activity does not simply co-vary with expected performance but is also linked to within-subject and between-subject variation in explicit confidence estimates. Our study is consistent with the proposal that the brain maintains choice-dependent and choice-independent estimates of certainty, and sheds light on why dysfunctional confidence often emerges following prefrontal lesions and/or degeneration.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRecent computational models propose that our sense of confidence in a choice reflects an estimate of the probability that the choice is correct. However, it has proven difficult to experimentally separate decision confidence from its component parts, such as our certainty about perceptual evidence or choice requirements. Here we devised a task to dissociate these quantities and isolate a distinct encoding of decision confidence in the medial prefrontal cortex of the human brain. We show that activity in this area not only tracks expected performance on a task but is also related to both within-subject and between-subject variation in a subjective sense of confidence. Our study illuminates why dysfunctional confidence often emerges following damage to prefrontal cortex.",

Gadd45{gamma} regulates the temporal dynamics of learning-induced immediate early gene (IEG) expression in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex through its interaction with DNA double-strand break (DSB)-mediated changes in DNA methylation. Our findings suggest a two-hit model of experience-dependent IEG activity and learning that comprises 1) a first wave of IEG expression governed by DSBs followed by an increase in DNA methylation, and 2) a second wave of IEG expression associated with Gadd45{gamma} and active DNA demethylation at the same site, which is necessary for memory consolidation.\\n\\nSignificance statementHow does the pattern of immediate early gene (IEG) transcription in the brain relate to the storage and accession of information, and what controls these patterns? This paper explores how GADD45{gamma}, a gene that is known to be involved with DNA modification and repair, regulates the temporal coding of IEGs underlying associative learning and memory. We reveal that, during fear learning, GADD45{gamma} serves to act as a coordinator of IEG expression and subsequent memory consolidation by directing temporally specific changes in active DNA demethylation at the promoter of plasticity-related IEGs.",

Here we report that neurons responsive to substrate vibrations applied to the mouse forelimb reveal a new way of representing frequency information in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). In contrast to vibrotactile stimulation of primate glabrous skin, which produces temporally entrained spiking and frequency independent firing rates, we found that mouse S1 neurons rely on a different coding scheme: their spike rates are conspicuously tuned to a preferred frequency of the stimulus. Histology, peripheral nerve block and optogenetic tagging experiments furthermore reveal that these responses are associated with the activation of mechanoreceptors located in deep subdermal tissue of the distal forelimb. We conclude that the encoding of frequency information of substrate-borne vibrations in the mouse S1 might be analogous to the representation of pitch of airborne sound in auditory cortex.",

    "abstract": "It is widely assumed that cells must be physically isolated to study their molecular profiles. However, intact tissue samples naturally exhibit variation in cellular composition, which drives covariation of cell-class-specific molecular features. By analyzing transcriptional covariation in 7221 intact CNS samples from 840 individuals representing billions of cells, we reveal the core transcriptional identities of major CNS cell classes in humans. By modeling intact CNS transcriptomes as a function of variation in cellular composition, we identify cell-class-specific transcriptional differences in Alzheimers disease, among brain regions, and between species. Among these, we show that PMP2 is expressed by human but not mouse astrocytes and significantly increases mouse astrocyte size upon ectopic expression in vivo, causing them to more closely resemble their human counterparts. Our work is available as an online resource (http://oldhamlab.ctec.ucsf.edu) and provides a generalizable strategy for determining the core molecular features of cellular identity in intact biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Long-term imaging of sensory cortex reveals a diverse range of stimulus response stability: some neurons retain stimulus responses that are stable over days whereas other neurons have highly plastic stimulus responses. Using a recurrent network model, we explore whether this observation could be due to an underlying diversity in the synaptic plasticity of neurons. We find that, in a network with diverse learning rates, neurons with fast rates are more coupled to population activity than neurons with slow rates. This phenomenon, which we call a plasticity-coupling link, surprisingly predicts that neurons with high population coupling exhibit more long-term stimulus response variability than neurons with low population coupling. We substantiate this prediction using recordings from the Allen Brain Observatory which track the orientation preferences of 15,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex. In agreement with our model, a neurons population coupling is correlated with the plasticity of its orientation preference. Finally, we show that high population coupling helps plastic neurons alter their stimulus preference during a simple perceptual learning task, but hinders the ability of stable neurons to provide an instructive signal for learning. This suggests a particular functional architecture: a stable  backbone of stimulus representation formed by neurons with slow synaptic plasticity and low population coupling, on top of which lies a flexible substrate of neurons with fast synaptic plasticity and high population coupling.",

    "abstract": "To develop efficient therapies and identify novel early biomarkers for chronic kidney disease an understanding of the molecular mechanisms orchestrating it is essential. We here set out to understand how differences in CKD origin are reflected in gene expression. To this end, we integrated publicly available human glomerular microarray gene expression data for nine kidney disease entities that account for a majority of CKD worldwide. We included data from five distinct studies and compared glomerular gene expression profiles to that of non-tumor parts of kidney cancer nephrectomy tissues. A major challenge was the integration of the data from different sources, platforms and conditions, that we mitigated with a bespoke stringent procedure. This allowed us to perform a global transcriptome-based delineation of different kidney disease entities, obtaining a landscape of their similarities and differences based on the genes that acquire a consistent differential expression between each kidney disease entity and nephrectomy tissue. Furthermore, we derived functional insights by inferring activity of signaling pathways and transcription factors from the collected gene expression data, and identified potential drug candidates based on expression signature matching. We validated representative findings by immunostaining in human kidney biopsies indicating e.g. that the transcription factor FOXM1 is significantly and specifically expressed in parietal epithelial cells in RPGN whereas not expressed in control kidney tissue. These results provide a foundation to comprehend the specific molecular mechanisms underlying different kidney disease entities, that can pave the way to identify biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. To facilitate this, we provide our results as a free interactive web application: https://saezlab.shinyapps.io/ckd_landscape/.\n\nTranslational StatementChronic kidney disease is a combination of entities with different etiologies.

    "abstract": "The formation of a viral capsid-the highly--ordered protein shell that surrounds the genome of a virus--is the canonical example of self-assembly1. The capsids of many positive-sense RNA viruses spontaneously assemble from in vitro mixtures of the coat protein and RNA2. The high yield of proper capsids that assemble is remarkable, given their structural complexity: 180 identical proteins must arrange into three distinct local configurations to form an icosahedral capsid with a triangulation number of 3 (T = 3)1. Despite a wealth of data from structural studies3-5 and simulations6-10, even the most fundamental questions about how these structures assemble remain unresolved. Experiments have not determined whether the assembly pathway involves aggregation or nucleation, or how the RNA controls the process. Here we use interferometric scattering microscopy11,12 to directly observe the in vitro assembly kinetics of individual, unlabeled capsids of bacteriophage MS2. By measuring how many coat proteins bind to each of many individual MS2 RNA strands on time scales from 1 ms to 900 s, we find that the start of assembly is broadly distributed in time and is followed by a rapid increase in the number of bound proteins. These measurements provide strong evidence for a nucleation-and-growth pathway. We also find that malformed structures assemble when multiple nuclei appear on the same RNA before the first nucleus has finished growing. Our measurements reveal the complex assembly pathways for viral capsids around RNA in quantitative detail, including the nucleation threshold, nucleation time, growth time, and constraints on the critical nucleus size. These results may inform strategies for engineering synthetic capsids13 or for derailing the assembly of pathogenic viruses14.",

We detail that PCR amplification is another major source of uncoupling, and becomes more pronounced with increased amounts of DNA template molecules and PCR cycles. To lessen uncoupling in systems that use paired elements for detection, we recommend minimizing the distance between elements, using low and equal template DNA inputs for plasmid and genomic DNA during PCR, and minimizing the number of PCR cycles. We also present a vector design for conducting combinatorial CRISPR screens that enables accurate barcode-based detection with a single short sequencing read and minimal uncoupling.",

    "abstract": "The Hydra polyp regenerates its head by transforming the gastric tissue below the wound into a head organizer made of two antagonistic cross-reacting components. The activator, previously characterized as Wnt3, drives apical differentiation by acting locally and auto-catalytically. The uncharacterized inhibitor, produced under the control of the activator, prevents ectopic head formation. By crossing RNA-seq data obtained in a {beta}-catenin(RNAi) screen performed in planarians and a quantitative analysis of positional and temporal gene expression in Hydra, we identified Sp5 as a transcription factor that fulfills the head inhibitor properties: a Wnt/{beta}-catenin inducible expression, a graded apical-to-basal expression, a sustained up-regulation during head regeneration, a multi-headed phenotype when knocked-down, a repressing activity on Wnt3 expression. In mammalian cells, Hydra and zebrafish Sp5 repress Wnt3 promoter activity while Hydra Sp5 also auto-activates its expression, possibly via {beta}-catenin and/or Tcf/Lef1 interaction. This work identifies Sp5 as a novel potent feedback loop inhibitor of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling across eumetazoans.",

    "abstract": "The histone demethylase LSD1 was originally discovered as removing methyl groups from di- and monomethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2/1), and several studies suggest it plays roles in meiosis as well as epigenetic sterility given that in its absence there is evidence of a progressive accumulation of H3K4me2 through generations. In addition to transgenerational sterility, growing evidence for the importance of histone methylation in the regulation of DNA damage repair has attracted more attention to the field in recent years. However, we are still far from understanding the mechanisms by which histone methylation is involved in DNA damage repair and only a few studies have been focused on the roles of histone demethylases in germline maintenance. Here, we show that the histone demethylase LSD1/CeSPR-5 is interacting with the Fanconi Anemia (FA) protein FANCM/CeFNCM-1 based on biochemical, cytological and genetic analyses. LSD1/CeSPR-5 is required for replication stress-induced S-phase checkpoint activation and its absence suppresses the embryonic lethality and larval arrest observed in fncm-1 mutants. FANCM/CeFNCM-1 re-localizes upon hydroxyurea exposure and co-localizes with FANCD2/CeFCD-2 and LSD1/CeSPR-5 suggesting coordination between this histone demethylase and FA components to resolve replication stress. Surprisingly, the FA pathway is required for H3K4me2 maintenance regardless of the presence of replication stress. Our study reveals a connection between Fanconi Anemia and epigenetic maintenance, therefore providing new mechanistic insight into the regulation of histone methylation in DNA repair.",

    "abstract": "Prostate-Associated Gene 4 (PAGE4) is a disordered protein implicated in the progression of prostate cancer. PAGE4 can be phosphorylated at two residue sites by Homeodomain-Interacting Protein Kinase 1 (HIPK1) to facilitate its binding to the Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor. In contrast, a further hyperphosphorylation of PAGE4 by CDC-Like Kinase 2 (CLK2) reduces its binding affinity to AP-1, thus affecting the androgen receptor (AR) activity. Both SAXS and smFRET experiments have shown a structural expansion of PAGE4 upon hyperphosphorylation and a significant increase in size at its N-terminal half than that at its C-terminus. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying this structural transition, we performed a series of constant temperature molecular dynamics simulations using Atomistic AWSEM -- a multi-scale molecular model combining detailed atomistic and coarse-grained simulation approaches. Our simulations show that electrostatic interaction drives a transient formation of an N-terminal loop, which causes the change in size for different phosphorylated forms of PAGE4. Phosphorylation also changes the preference of secondary structure formation of PAGE4, which signifies a transition between states that display different degree of disorder. Finally, we construct a mechanism-based mathematical model that allows us to capture the interactions of different forms of PAGE4 with AP-1 and AR, a key therapeutic target in prostate cancer. Our model predicts intracellular oscillatory dynamics of HIPK1-PAGE4, CLK2-PAGE4 and AR activity, indicating phenotypic heterogeneity in an isogenic cell population. Thus, conformational switching among different forms of PAGE4 may potentially affect the efficiency of therapeutic targeting of AR.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide analysis of transcription in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has revealed robust variation in steady-state mRNA abundance throughout the 48-hour intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) suggesting that this process is highly dynamic and tightly regulated. However, the precise timing of mRNA transcription and decay remains poorly understood due to the utilization of methods that only measure total RNA and cannot differentiate between newly transcribed, decaying and stable cellular RNAs. Here we utilize rapid 4-thiouracil (4-TU) incorporation via pyrimidine salvage to specifically label, capture and quantify newly-synthesized P. falciparum RNA transcripts at every hour throughout the IDC following erythrocyte invasion. This high resolution global analysis of the transcriptome captures the timing and rate of transcription for each newly synthesized mRNA in vivo, revealing active transcription throughout all stages of the IDC. To determine the fraction of active transcription and/or transcript stabilization contributing to the total mRNA abundance at each timepoint we have generated a statistical model to fit the data for each gene which reveals varying degrees of transcription and stabilization for each mRNA corresponding to developmental transitions and independent of abundance profile. Finally, our results provide new insight into co-regulation of mRNAs throughout the IDC through regulatory DNA sequence motifs associated with these processes, thereby expanding our understanding of P. falciparum mRNA dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and related apicomplexan pathogens contain a non-photosynthetic plastid called the apicoplast. Derived from an unusual secondary eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiosis, the apicoplast is a fascinating organelle whose function and biogenesis rely on a complex amalgamation of bacterial and algal pathways. Because these pathways are distinct from the human host, the apicoplast is an excellent source of novel antimalarial targets. Despite its biomedical importance and evolutionary significance, the absence of a reliable apicoplast proteome has limited most studies to the handful of pathways identified by homology to bacteria or primary chloroplasts, precluding our ability to study the most novel apicoplast pathways. Here we combine proximity biotinylation-based proteomics (BioID) and a new machine learning algorithm to generate a high-confidence apicoplast proteome consisting of 346 proteins. Critically, the high accuracy of this proteome significantly outperforms previous prediction-based methods and extends beyond other BioID studies of unique parasite compartments. Half of identified proteins have unknown function, and 77% are predicted to be important for normal blood-stage growth. We validate the apicoplast localization of a subset of novel proteins and show that an ATP-binding cassette protein ABCF1 is essential for blood-stage survival and plays a previously unknown role in apicoplast biogenesis. These findings indicate critical organellar functions for newly discovered apicoplast proteins. The apicoplast proteome will be an important resource for elucidating unique pathways derived from secondary endosymbiosis and prioritizing antimalarial drug targets.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-mediated gene regulation is known for its ability to control multiple targets simultaneously due to its modular nature: the same dCas9 effector can target different genes simply by changing the associated gRNA. However, multiplexing requires the sharing of limited amounts of dCas9 proteins among multiple gRNAs, leading to resource competition. In turn, competition between gRNAs for the same resource may hamper network function. In this work, we develop a general model that takes into account the sharing of a limited amount of dCas9 protein for arbitrary CRISPR-mediated gene repression networks. We demonstrate that, as a result of resource competition, hidden interactions appear, that modify the intended network regulations. As a case study, we analyze the effects of these hidden interactions in repression cascades. In particular, we illustrate that perfect adaptation to resource fluctuations can be achieved in cascades with an even number of repressors. In contrast, cascades with an odd number of repressors are substantially impacted by resource competition.",
