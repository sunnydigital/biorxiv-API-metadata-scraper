    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (https://doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100053). Despite the description of bioregions dates back from the origin of biogeography, the processes originating their associated species pools have been seldom studied. Ancient historical events are thought to play a fundamental role in configuring bioregions, but the effects of more recent events on these regional biotas are largely unknown. We use a network approach to identify regional and sub-regional faunas of European Carabus beetles, and analyse the effects of dispersal barriers, niche similarities and phylogenetic history on their configuration. We identify a transition zone matching the limit of the ice sheets at Last Glacial Maximum. While southern species pools are mostly separated by dispersal barriers, in the north species are mainly sorted by their environmental niches. Strikingly, most phylogenetic structuration of Carabus faunas occurred during the Pleistocene. Our results show how extreme recent historical events -such as Pleistocene climate cooling, rather than just deep-time evolutionary processes, can profoundly modify the composition and structure of geographic species pools.",

    "abstract": "Finding a sought visual target object requires combining visual information about a scene with a remembered representation of the target to create a \\\"target match\\\" signal that indicates when a target is in view. Target match signals have been reported to exist within high-level visual brain areas including inferotemporal cortex (IT), where they are mixed with representations of image and object identity. However, these signals are not well understood, particularly in the context of the real-world challenge that the objects we search for typically appear at different positions, sizes, and within different background contexts. To investigate these signals, we recorded neural responses in IT as two rhesus monkeys performed a delayed-match-to-sample object search task in which target objects could appear at a variety of identity-preserving transformations. Consistent with the existence of behaviorally-relevant target match signals in IT, we found that IT contained a linearly separable target match representation that reflected behavioral confusions on trials in which the monkeys made errors. Additionally, target match signals were highly distributed across the IT population, and while a small fraction of units reflected target match signals as target match suppression, most units reflected target match signals as target match enhancement. Finally, we found that the potentially detrimental impact of target match signals on visual representations was mitigated by target match modulation that was approximately (albeit imperfectly) multiplicative. Together, these results support the existence of a robust, behaviorally-relevant target match representation in IT that is configured to minimally interfere with IT visual representations.",

    "abstract": "MotivationMost genetic variants implicated in complex diseases by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are non-coding, making it challenging to understand the causative genes involved in disease. Integrating external information such as quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of molecular traits (e.g., expression, methylation) is a powerful approach to identify the subset of GWAS signals explained by regulatory effects. In particular, expression QTLs (eQTLs) help pinpoint the responsible gene among the GWAS regions that harbor many genes, while methylation QTLs (mQTLs) help identify the epigenetic mechanisms that impact gene expression which in turn affect disease risk. In this work we propose multiple-trait-coloc (moloc), a Bayesian statistical framework that integrates GWAS summary data with multiple molecular QTL data to identify regulatory effects at GWAS risk loci.\\n\\nResultsWe applied moloc to schizophrenia (SCZ) and eQTL/mQTL data derived from human brain tissue and identified 52 candidate genes that influence SCZ through methylation. Our method can be applied to any GWAS and relevant functional data to help prioritize disease associated genes.\\n\\nAvailabilitymoloc is available for download as an R package (https://github.com/clagiamba/moloc).

    "abstract": "PurposeThe majority of cancer patients receive treatments that are minimally informed by omics data. We propose a precision medicine computational framework (PANOPLY: Precision cancer genomic report: single sample inventory) to identify and prioritize drug targets and cancer therapy regimens.\\n\\nMethodsThe PANOPLY approach integrates clinical data with germline and somatic features obtained from multi-omics platforms, and apply machine learning, and network analysis approaches in the context of the individual patient and matched controls. The PANOPLY workflow employs four steps (i) selection of matched controls to the case of interest (ii) identification of case-specific genomic events (iii) identification of suitable drugs using the driver-gene network and random forest analyses and (iv) provide an integrated multi-omics case report of the patient with prioritization of anti-cancer drugs.\\n\\nResultsThe PANOPLY workflow can be executed on a stand-alone virtual machine and is also available for download as an R package. We applied the method to an institutional breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy study which collected clinical and genomic data as well as patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to investigate the prioritization offered by PANOPLY. In a chemotherapy-resistant PDX model, we found that that the prioritized drug, olaparib, was more effective than placebo in treating the tumor (P < 0.05). We also applied PANOPLY to in-house and publicly accessible multi-omics tumor datasets with therapeutic response or survival data available.\\n\\nConclusionPANOPLY shows promise as a means to prioritize drugs based on clinical and multi-omics data for an individual cancer patient. Additional studies are needed to confirm this approach.",

    "abstract": "Cell morphogenesis is a fundamental process involved in tissue formation. One of the challenges in the fabrication of living tissues in vitro is to recapitulate the complex morphologies of individual cells. Despite tremendous progress in understanding biophysical principles underlying tissue/organ morphogenesis at the organ level, little work has been done to understand morphogenesis at the cellular and microtissue level. In this work, we developed a 2D computational model for studying cell morphogenesis in monolayer tissues. The model is mainly composed of four modules: mechanics of cytoskeleton, cell motility, cell-substrate interaction, and cell-cell interaction. The model integrates the biochemical and mechanical activities within individual cells spatiotemporally. Finite element method (FEM) is used to model the irregular shapes of cells and to solve the resulting system of reaction-diffusion-stress equations. Automated mesh generation is used to handle the element distortion in FEM due to the large shape changes of the cells. The computer program can simulate tens to hundreds of cells interacting with each other and with the elastic substrate on desktop workstations efficiently. The simulations demonstrated that our computational model can be used to study cell polarization, single cell migration, durotaxis, and morphogenesis in cell monolayers.",

To evaluate this proposal, we recorded IT neural responses as two monkeys performed a single-exposure visual memory task designed to measure the rates of forgetting with time. We found that a weighted linear read-out of IT was a better predictor of the monkeys forgetting rates and reaction time patterns than a strict instantiation of the repetition suppression hypothesis, expressed as a total spike count scheme. Behavioral predictions could be attributed to visual memory signals that were reflected as repetition suppression and were intermingled with visual selectivity, but only when combined across the most sensitive neurons.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of most cancer targeted therapies is short lived since tumors evolve and develop resistance. Combinations of drugs offer the potential to overcome resistance, however the number of possible combinations is vast necessitating data-driven approaches to find optimal treatments tailored to a patients tumor. AstraZeneca carried out 11,576 experiments on 910 drug combinations across 85 cancer cell lines, recapitulating in vivo response profiles. These data, the largest openly available screen, were hosted by DREAM alongside deep molecular characterization from the Sanger Institute for a Challenge to computationally predict synergistic drug pairs and associated biomarkers. 160 teams participated to provide the most comprehensive methodological development and subsequent benchmarking to date. Winning methods incorporated prior knowledge of putative drug target interactions. For >60% of drug combinations synergy was reproducibly predicted with an accuracy matching biological replicate experiments, however 20% of drug combinations were poorly predicted by all methods. Genomic rationale for synergy predictions were identified, including antagonism unique to combined PIK3CB/D inhibition with the ADAM17 inhibitor where synergy is seen with other PI3K pathway inhibitors.

    "abstract": "The transcriptional regulator YAP1 is critical for the pathological activation of fibroblasts. In normal fibroblasts YAP1 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm, while in activated cancer-associated fibroblasts it exhibits nuclear localization and promotes the expression of many genes required for pro-tumorigenic functions. Here, we investigate the dynamics of YAP1 shuttling in normal and activated fibroblasts, using EYFP-YAP1, quantitative photo-bleaching methods, and mathematical modeling. We find that both 14-3-3 and TEAD binding modulate YAP1 shuttling, but neither affects nuclear import. Instead, we find that YAP1 serine phosphorylation is required for nuclear export. Furthermore, YAP1 nuclear accumulation in activated fibroblasts results from Src and actomyosin-dependent suppression of phosphorylated YAP1 export. Finally, we show that nuclear constrained YAP1, upon XPO1 depletion, remains sensitive to blockade of actomyosin function. Together, these data place nuclear export at the center of YAP1 regulation and indicate that the cytoskeleton can regulate YAP1 within the nucleus.",

Seventeen loci surpass genome-wide significance (p<5x10-8) for phenotypes ranging from pathogen replication to cytokine production. Combining H2P2 with clinical association data from the eMERGE Network and experimental validation revealed evidence for mechanisms of action and connections with diseases. We identified a SNP near CXCL10 as a cis-cytokine-QTL and a new risk factor for inflammatory bowel disease. A SNP in ZBTB20 demonstrated pleiotropy, partially mediated through NF{kappa}B signaling, and was associated with viral hepatitis.

The small body of research on the topic that has been conducted so far seems to suggest an inverse relationship between the two constructs. A smaller number of studies have found the opposite result, however, and some of the previous studies have been limited by small sample sizes and unrepresentative samples. The current study attempts to help clarify the relationship between resting heart rate and psychopathic traits in a large, nationally representative sample (analytical N ranged from 14,173-14,220) using an alternative measure of psychopathic traits that is less focused on antisocial processes, and rooted in personality traits. No significant relationship between heart rate and psychopathic traits, or heart rate and a measure of cold heartedness, was found after controlling for age, sex, and race. Implications of the findings, study limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian cerebral neocortex has a unique structure, composed of layers of different neuron types, interconnected in a stereotyped fashion. While the overall developmental program seems to be conserved, there are divergent developmental factors generating cortical diversity amongst mammalian species. In terms of cortical neuronal numbers some of the determining factors are the size of the founder population, the duration of cortical neurogenesis, the proportion of different progenitor types, and the fine-tuned balance between self-renewing and differentiative divisions. We develop a mathematical model of neurogenesis that, accounting for these factors, aims at explaining the high diversity in neuronal numbers found across mammalian species. By framing our hypotheses in rigorous mathematical terms, we are able to identify paths of neurogenesis that match experimentally observed patterns in mouse, macaque and human. Additionally, we use our model to identify key parameters that would particularly benefit from accurate experimental investigation. We find that the timing of a switch in favor of symmetric neurogenic divisions produces the highest variation in cortical neuronal numbers. Surprisingly, in our model the increase in cortical neuronal numbers does not necessarily reflect a larger size of founder population, a prediction that identified a specific need for experimental quantifications.",

However, evidence of significant cell-to-cell variability suggests that the activity of this network varies within individual stem cells, leading to differential processing of environmental signals and variability in cell fates. Here, we adapt a method originally designed for face recognition to infer regulatory network patterns within individual cells from single-cell expression data. Using this method we identify three distinct network configurations in cultured mouse embryonic stem cells - corresponding to naive and formative pluripotent states and an early primitive endoderm state - and associate these configurations with particular combinations of regulatory network activity archetypes that govern different aspects of the cells response to environmental stimuli, cell cycle status and core information processing circuitry. These results show how variability in cell identities arise naturally from alterations in underlying regulatory network dynamics and demonstrate how methods from machine learning may be used to better understand single cell biology, and the collective dynamics of cell communities.",

Thus, co-expression clustering is a routine step in large-scale analyses of gene expression data. We show that commonly used clustering methods produce results that substantially disagree with each other, and do not match the biological expectations of co-expressed gene clusters. Furthermore, these clusters can contain up to 50% unreliably assigned genes. Consequently, downstream analyses of these clusters (e.g. functional term enrichment analysis) suffer from high error rates. We present clust, an automated method that solves these problems by extracting clusters that match the biological expectations of co-expressed genes. Using 100 datasets from five model organisms we demonstrate that clusters generated by clust are better than those produced by other methods, both numerically and for use in functional analysis. Finally, we show that clust can simultaneously cluster multiple datasets, enabling users to leverage the large quantity of public expression data for novel comparative analysis.",

    "abstract": "Cell proliferation is the most important cellular-level mechanism responsible for regulating cell population dynamics in living tissues. Modern experimental procedures show that the proliferation rates of individual cells can vary significantly within the same cell line. However, in the mathematical biology literature, cell proliferation is typically modelled using a classical logistic equation which neglects variations in the proliferation rate. In this work, we consider a discrete mathematical model of cell migration and cell proliferation, modulated by volume exclusion (crowding) effects, with variable rates of proliferation across the total population. We refer to this variability as heterogeneity. Constructing the continuum limit of the discrete model leads to a generalisation of the classical logistic growth model. Comparing numerical solutions of the model to averaged data from discrete simulations shows that the new model captures the key features of the discrete process. Applying the extended logistic model to simulate a proliferation assay using rates from recent experimental literature shows that neglecting the role of heterogeneity can, at times, lead to misleading results.",

Neuroimaging studies examining the encoding of stimulus uncertainty have relied almost exclusively on manipulations in which stimuli were presented in a single sensory modality, and further assumed that neural responses vary monotonically with uncertainty. This has left a gap in theoretical development with respect to two core issues: i) are there cross-modal brain systems that encode input uncertainty in way that generalizes across sensory modalities, and ii) are there brain systems that track input uncertainty in a non-monotonic fashion? We used multivariate pattern analysis to address these two issues using auditory, visual and audiovisual inputs. We found signatures of cross-modal encoding in frontoparietal, orbitofrontal, and association cortices using a searchlight cross-classification analysis where classifiers trained to discriminate levels of uncertainty in one modality were tested in another modality. Additionally, we found widespread systems encoding uncertainty non-monotonically using classifiers trained to discriminate intermediate levels of uncertainty from both the highest and lowest uncertainty levels. These findings comprise the first comprehensive report of cross-modal and non-monotonic neural sensitivity to statistical regularities in the environment, and suggest that conventional paradigms testing for monotonic responses to uncertainty in a single sensory modality may have limited generalizability.",

    "abstract": "The spatiotemporal expression of genes is controlled by enhancer sequences that bind transcription factors. Identifying the target genes of enhancers remains difficult because enhancers regulate gene expression over long genomic distances. To address this, we used an evolutionary approach to build two genome-wide maps of enhancer-gene associations in the human and zebrafish genomes. Enhancers were identified using sequence conservation, and linked to their predicted target genes using PEGASUS, a bioinformatics method that relies on evolutionary conservation of synteny. The analysis of these maps revealed that the number of enhancers linked to a gene correlate with its expression breadth. Comparison of both maps identified hundreds of vertebrate ancestral regulatory relationships from which we could determine that enhancer-gene distances scale with genome size despite strong positional conservation. The two maps represent a resource for further studies, including the prioritisation of sequence variants in whole genome sequence of patients affected by genetic diseases.",

    "abstract": "The recognition of the group Archaea as a major branch of the Tree of Life (ToL) prompted a new view of the evolution of biodiversity. The genomic representation of archaeal biodiversity has since significantly increased. In addition, advances in phylogenetic modeling of multi-locus datasets have resolved many recalcitrant branches of the ToL. Despite the technical advances and an expanded taxonomic representation, two important aspects of the origins and evolution of the Archaea remain controversial, even as we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the monumental discovery. These issues concern (i) the uniqueness (monophyly) of the Archaea, and (ii) the evolutionary relationships of the Archaea to the Bacteria and the Eukarya; both of these are relevant to the deep structure of the ToL. Here, to explore the causes for this persistent ambiguity, I examine multiple datasets that support contradicting conclusions. Results indicate that the uncertainty is primarily due to a scarcity of information in standard datasets -- the core genes datasets -- to reliably resolve the conflicts. These conflicts can be resolved efficiently by comparing patterns of variation in the distribution of functional genomic signatures, which are less diffused unlike patterns of primary sequence variation. Relatively lower heterogeneity in distribution patterns minimizes uncertainties, which supports statistically robust phylogenetic inferences, especially of the earliest divergences of life. This case study further highlights the limits of primary sequence data in resolving difficult phylogenetic problems and casts doubt on evolutionary inferences drawn solely from the analyses of a small set of core genes.",

The apical complex lysine (K) methyltransferase (AKMT) of the human parasite Toxoplasma gondii was recently shown to play a critical role in regulating cellular motility. Here we report a 2.1-[A] resolution crystal structure of the conserved and functional C-terminal portion (aa289-709) of T. gondii AKMT. AKMT dimerizes via a unique intermolecular interface mediated by the C-terminal TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat)-like domain together with a specific zinc-binding motif that is absent from all other KMTs. Disruption of AKMT dimerization impaired both its enzyme activity and parasite egress from infected host cells in vivo. Structural comparisons reveal that AKMT is related to the KMTs in the SMYD family, with, however, a number of distinct structural features in addition to the unusual dimerization interface. These features are conserved among the apicomplexan parasites and their free-living relatives, but not found in any known KMTs in animals. AKMT therefore is the founding member of a new subclass of KMT that has important implications for the evolution of the apicomplexans.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBiotic interactions are ubiquitous and require information from ecology, evolutionary biology, and functional genetics in order to be completely understood. However, study systems that are amenable to investigations across such disparate fields are rare. Figs and fig wasps are a classic system for ecology and evolutionary biology with poor functional genetics; C. elegans is a classic system for functional genetics with poor ecology. In order to help bridge these disciplines, here we describe the natural history of a close relative of C. elegans, C. sp. 34, that is associated with the fig Ficus septica and its pollinating Ceratosolen wasps.\\n\\nResultsTo understand the natural context of fig-associated Caenorhabditis, fresh F. septica figs from four Okinawan islands were sampled, dissected, and observed under microscopy. C. sp. 34 was found in all islands where F. septica figs were found. C. sp. 34 was routinely found in the fig interior and almost never observed on the outside surface. Caenorhabditis was only found in pollinated figs, and C. sp. 34 was more likely to be observed in figs with more foundress pollinating wasps. Actively reproducing C. sp. 34 dominated younger figs, whereas older figs with emerging wasp progeny harbored C. sp. 34 dispersal larvae. Additionally, C. sp. 34 was observed dismounting from plated Ceratosolen pollinating wasps. C. sp. 34 was never found on non-pollinating, parasitic Philotrypesis wasps. Finally, C. sp. 34 was only observed in F. septica figs among five Okinawan Ficus species sampled.\\n\\nConclusionThese observations suggest a natural history where C. sp. 34 proliferates in young F. septica figs and disperses from old figs on Ceratosolen pollinating fig wasps. The fig and wasp host specificity of this Caenorhabditis is highly divergent from its close relatives and frames hypotheses for future investigations. This natural co-occurrence of the fig/fig wasp and Caenorhabditis study systems sets the stage for an integrated research program that can help to explain the evolution of interspecific interactions.",

One criticism of that study is that the visual suppression method used, forward and backward masking (FBM), may be too blunt in the way it interferes with visual processing to allow for unconscious forced-choice discrimination. To investigate this question we compared FBM directly to continuous flash suppression (CFS) in a two-interval forced choice task. Although CFS is popular, and may be thought of as a more powerful visual suppression technique, we found no difference in the degree of perceptual impairment between the two suppression types. To the extent that CFS impairs perception, both objective discrimination and subjective awareness are impaired to similar degrees under FBM. This pattern was consistently observed across 3 experiments in which various experimental parameters were varied. These findings provide evidence for an ongoing debate about unconscious perception: normal observers cannot perform forced-choice discrimination tasks unconsciously.",

    "abstract": "Flying animals maneuver and hover through environments where wind gusts and flower wakes produce unsteady flow. Although both flight maneuvers and aerodynamic mechanisms have been studied independently, little is known about how these interact in an environment where flow is already unsteady. Moths forage from flowers by hovering in the flowers wake. We investigate hawkmoths tracking a 3D-printed robotic flower in a wind tunnel. We visualize the flow in the wake and around the wings and compare tracking performance to previous experiments in a still air flight chamber. Like in still air, moths flying in the flower wake exhibit near perfect tracking at low frequencies where natural flowers move. However, tracking in the flower wake results in a larger overshoot between 2-5 Hz. System identification of flower tracking reveals that moths also display reduced-order dynamics in wind, compared to still air. Smoke visualization of the flower wake shows that the dominant vortex shedding corresponds to the same frequency band as the increased overshoot. Despite these large effects on tracking dynamics in wind, the leading edge vortex (LEV) remains bound to the wing throughout the wingstroke and does not burst. The LEV also maintains the same qualitative structure seen in steady air. Persistence of a stable LEV during decreased flower tracking demonstrates the interplay between hovering and maneuvering.\\n\\nSummary statementWe examined how moths maneuver in the wake of flowers and discover that flower tracking dynamics are simplified compared to still air, while the leading edge vortex does not burst and extends continuously across the wings and thorax.",

RfaH function depends critically on an ops sequence, an exemplar of a consensus pause, in the non-template DNA strand of the transcription bubble. We used structural and functional analyses to elucidate the role of ops in RfaH recruitment. Our results demonstrate that ops induces pausing to facilitate RfaH binding and establishes direct contacts with RfaH. Strikingly, the non-template DNA forms a hairpin in the RfaH: ops complex structure, flipping out a conserved T residue that is specifically recognized by RfaH. Molecular modeling and genetic evidence support the notion that ops hairpin is required for RfaH recruitment. We argue that both the sequence and the structure of the non-template strand are read out by transcription factors, expanding the repertoire of transcriptional regulators in all domains of life.",

    "abstract": "How does form arise during development and change during evolution? How does form relate to function, and what enables embryonic structures to presage their later use in adults? To address these questions, we leverage the distinct functional morphology of the jaw in duck, chick, and quail. In connection with their specialized mode of feeding, duck develop a secondary cartilage at the tendon insertion of their jaw adductor muscle on the mandible. An equivalent cartilage is absent in chick and quail. We hypothesize that species-specific jaw architecture and mechanical forces promote secondary cartilage in duck through the differential regulation of FGF and TGF{beta} signaling. First, we perform transplants between chick and duck embryos and demonstrate that the ability of neural crest mesenchyme (NCM) to direct the species-specific insertion of muscle and the formation of secondary cartilage depends upon the amount and spatial distribution of NCM-derived connective tissues. Second, we quantify motility and build finite element models of the jaw complex in duck and quail, which reveals a link between species-specific jaw architecture and the predicted mechanical force environment. Third, we investigate the extent to which mechanical load mediates FGF and TGF{beta} signaling in the duck jaw adductor insertion, and discover that both pathways are mechano-responsive and required for secondary cartilage formation. Additionally, we find that FGF and TGF{beta} signaling can also induce secondary cartilage in the absence of mechanical force or in the adductor insertion of quail embryos. Thus, our results provide novel insights on molecular, cellular, and biomechanical mechanisms that couple musculoskeletal form and function during development and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities often perform important functions that arise from interactions among member species. Community functions can be improved via artificial selection: Many communities are repeatedly grown, mutations arise, and communities with the highest desired function are chosen to reproduce where each is partitioned into multiple offspring communities for the next cycle. Since selection efficacy is often unimpressive in published experiments and since multiple experimental parameters need to be tuned, we sought to use computer simulations to learn how to design effective selection strategies. We simulated community selection to improve a community function that requires two species and imposes a fitness cost on one of the species. This simplified case allowed us to distill community function down to two fundamental and orthogonal components: a heritable determinant and a nonheritable determinant. We then visualize a \"community function landscape\" relating community function to these two determinants, and demonstrate that the evolutionary trajectory on the landscape is restricted along a path designated by ecological interactions. This path can prevent the attainment of maximal community function, and trap communities in landscape locations where community function has low heritability. Exploiting these observations, we devise a species spiking approach to shift the path to improve community function heritability and consequently selection efficacy. We show that our approach is applicable to communities with complex and unknown function landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Wing polymorphism is a prominent feature of numerous insect groups, but the genomic basis for this diversity remains poorly understood. Wing reduction is a commonly observed trait in many species of stoneflies, particularly in cold or alpine environments. The widespread New Zealand stonefly Zelandoperla fenestrata species group (Z. fenestrata, Z. tillyardi, Z. pennulata) contains populations ranging from long-winged (macropterous) to vestigial-winged (micropterous), with the latter phenotype typically associated with high altitudes. The presence of flightless forms on numerous mountain ranges, separated by lowland fully winged populations, suggests wing reduction has occurred multiple times. We use Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) to test for genetic differentiation between fully winged (n=62) and vestigial-winged (n=34) individuals, sampled from a sympatric population of distinct wing morphotypes, to test for a genetic basis for wing morphology. We found no population genetic differentiation between these two morphotypes across 6,843 SNP loci, however we did detect several outlier loci that strongly differentiated morphotypes across independent tests. This indicates small regions of the genome are likely to be highly differentiated between morphotypes, indicating a genetic basis for morphotype differentiation. These results provide a clear basis for ongoing genomic analysis to elucidate critical regulatory pathways for wing development in Pterygota.",

    "abstract": "Animals have access to many alternative information sources when making decisions, such as private information (e.g. memory) and social information. Social insects make extensive use of social information. However, when intentional social information (e.g. pheromone trails in ants) conflicts with private information (e.g. route memories), insects often follow their private information. Why is this? We propose that an asymmetry in the type of information provided by these two information sources drives the neglect of social information: In ants, workers with certain information about the quality of a food source (memory) ignore valuable social information (pheromone trails) because the pheromone trails encode only a very ambiguous measure of food quality. This leads to a testable hypothesis: the addition of unambiguous quality information should rescue social information following. To test this, we trained ants to a poor quality (0.25M sucrose) food source, and then provided an alternative path along with either 1) no information, 2) a pheromone trail, 3) a 0.2l 1.5M sucrose droplet, providing unambiguous quality information, or 4) both a trail and a droplet. When either no or only one information source was provided (1-3), most ants (60-75%) continued following their own memory. However, the addition of unambiguous quality information (4) rescued trail following: when both a trail and a droplet were provided, 75% of ants followed the trail. In further experiments, we show that quality information gleaned from direct contact with fed nestmates produced similar effects. Using florescence microscopy, we demonstrate that food (and information) flows from fed workers to outgoing foragers, explaining the frequent contacts on trails. We propose that the type of information an information source can convey, and its ambiguity, is a strong driver of which source of information is attended to.",

    "abstract": "Enhancer sequences regulate the expression of genes from afar by providing a binding platform for transcription factors, often in a tissue-specific or context-specific manner. Despite their importance in health and disease, our understanding of these DNA sequences, and their regulatory grammar, is limited. This impairs our ability to identify new enhancers along the genome, or to understand the effect of enhancer mutations and their role in genetic diseases.\\n\\nWe trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify enhancer sequences in multiple species. We used multiple biological datasets, including simulated sequences, in vivo binding data of single transcription factors and genome-wide chromatin maps of active enhancers in 17 mammalian species. Our deep networks obtained high classification accuracy by combining two training strategies: First, training on enhancers vs. non-enhancer background sequences, we identified short (1-4bp) low-complexity motifs. Second, by replacing the negative training set by adversarial k-order random shuffles of enhancer sequences (thus maintaining base composition while shuttering longer motifs, including transcription factor binding sites), we identified a set of biologically meaningful motifs, unique to enhancers. In addition, classification performance improved when combining positive data from all species together, showing a shared mammalian regulatory architecture.\\n\\nOur results demonstrate that design of adversarial training data, and transfer of learned parameters between networks trained on different species/datasets improve the overall performance and capture biologically meaningful information in the parameters of the learned network.\\n\\nContact: or.zuk@mail.huji.ac.il, tommy@cs.huji.ac.il",

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the study of cancer across research labs around the globe, however genomic testing in clinical settings remain limited. Advances in sequencing reliability, pipeline analysis, accumulation of relevant data, and the reduction of costs are rapidly increasing the feasibility of NGS-based clinical decision making.\\n\\nMethodsWe report the development of MammaSeq, a breast cancer specific NGS panel, targeting 79 genes and 1369 mutations, optimized for use in primary and metastatic breast cancer. To validate the panel, 46 solid tumor and 14 plasma circulating-free cfDNA samples were sequenced to a mean depth of 2311X and 1820 X respectively. Variants were called using Ion Torrent Suite 4.0 and annotated with cravat CHASM. CNVKit was used to call copy number variants in the solid tumor cohort. The oncoKB Precision Oncology Database was used to identify clinically actionable variants. ddPCR was used to validate select cfDNA mutations.\\n\\nResultsIn cohorts of 46 solid tumors and 14 cfDNA samples from patients with advanced breast cancer we identified 592 and 43 protein coding mutations. Mutations per sample in the solid tumor cohort ranged from 1 to 128 (median 3) and the cfDNA cohort ranged from 0 to 26 (median 2.5). Copy number analysis in the solid tumor cohort identified 46 amplifications and 35 deletions. We identified 26 clinically actionable variants (levels 1-3) annotated by OncoKB, distributed across 20 out of 46 cases (40%), in the solid tumor cohort. Allele frequencies of ESR1 and FOXA1 mutations correlated with CA.27.29 levels in patient matched blood draws.\\n\\nConclusionsIn solid tumors biopsies and cfDNA, MammaSeq detects clinicaly actionable mutations (oncoKB levels 1-3) in 22/46 (48%) solid tumors and in 4/14 (29%) of cfDNA samples. MammaSeq is a targeted panel suitable for clinically actionable mutation detection in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Multi-species microbial communities often display functions - biochemical activities unattainable by member species alone, such as fighting pathogens. To improve community function, we can artificially select communities by growing \\\"Newborn\\\" communities over \\\"maturation time\\\" into \\\"Adult\\\" communities, and selecting highest-functioning Adults to \\\"reproduce\\\" by diluting each into multiple Newborns of the next cycle. Community selection has been attempted a few times on complex communities, often generating mixed results that are difficult to interpret. Here, we ask how costly community function may be improved via mutations and community selection. We simulate selection of two-species communities where Helpers digest Waste and generate Byproduct essential to Manufacturers; Manufacturers divert a fraction of their growth to make Product. Community function, the total Product in an \\\"Adult\\\", is sub-optimal even when both species have been pre-optimized as monocultures. If we dilute an Adult into Newborns by pipetting (a common experimental procedure), stochastic fluctuations in Newborn composition prevents community function from improving. Reducing fluctuations via cell sorting allows selection to work. Our conclusions hold regardless of whether H and M are commensal or mutualistic, or variations in model assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Recent simulation studies examining the performance of Bayesian species delimitation as implemented in the BPP program have suggested that BPP may detect population splits but not species divergences and that it tends to over-split when data of many loci are analyzed. Here we confirm several of these results and provide their mathematical justifications. We point out that the distinction between population and species splits made in the protracted speciation model has no influence on the generation of gene trees and sequence data, which explains why no method can use such data to distinguish between population splits and speciation. We suggest that the the protracted speciation model is unrealistic and its mechanism for assigning species status contradicts prevailing taxonomic practice. We confirm the suggestion, based on simulation, that in the case of speciation with gene flow, Bayesian model selection as implemented in BPP tends to detect population splits when the amount of data (the number of loci) increases so over-splitting is a legitimate concern. We discuss the use of a recently proposed empirical genealogical divergence index (gdi) for species delimitation and illustrate that parameter estimates produced by a full likelihood analysis as implemented in BPP provide much more reliable inference under the gdi than the approximate method PHRAPL. We suggest that the Bayesian model-selection approach is useful for identifying sympatric cryptic species while Bayesian parameter estimation under the multispecies coalescent can be used to implement empirical criteria for determining species status among allopatric populations.",

    "abstract": "Yeasts are ubiquitous microbes found in virtually all environments. Many yeast species can ferment sugar into ethanol and CO2, and humans have taken advantage of these characteristics to produce fermented beverages for thousands of years. As a naturally abundant source of fermentable sugar, honey has had a central role in such fermentations since Neolithic times. However, as beverage fermentation has become industrialized, the processes have been streamlined, including the narrow and almost exclusive usage of yeasts in the genus Saccharomyces for fermentation. We set out to identify wild honey- or honey bee-related yeasts that can be used in honey fermentation. Here, we isolated two strains of Torulaspora delbrueckii from the gut of a locally collected honey bee. Both strains were able to ferment honey sugar into mead but failed to metabolize more than a modest amount of wort sugar in trial beer fermentations. Further, the meads fermented by the T. delbrueckii strains displayed better sensory characteristics than mead fermented by a champagne yeast. The combination of T. delbrueckii and champagne yeast strains was also able to rapidly ferment honey at an industrial scale. Thus, wild yeasts represent a largely untapped reservoir for the introduction of desirable sensory characteristics in fermented beverages such as mead.",

    "abstract": "Measuring allele-specific expression (ASE) is a powerful approach for identifying cis-regulatory genetic variants. Here we developed a novel targeted proteomics method for quantification of allele-specific protein expression (ASPE) based on scheduled high resolution multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM-HR) with a heavy stable isotope-labeled quantitative concatamer (QconCAT) internal protein standard. This strategy was applied to the determination of the ASPE of UGT2B15 in human livers using the common UGT2B15 nonsynonymous variant rs1902023 (i.e. Y85D) as the marker to differentiate expressions from the two alleles. The QconCAT standard contains both the wild type tryptic peptide and the Y85D mutant peptide at a ratio of 1:1 to ensure accurate measurement of the ASPE of UGT2B15. The results from 18 UGT2B15 Y85D heterozygotes revealed that the ratios between wild type Y allele and mutant D allele varied from 0.60 to 1.46, indicating the presence of cis-regulatory variants. In addition, we observed no significant correlations between the ASPE and mRNA ASE of UGT2B15, suggesting the involvement of different cis-acting variants in regulating the transcription and translation processes of the gene. This novel ASPE approach provides a powerful tool for capturing cis-genetic variants involved in post-transcription processes, an important yet understudied area of research.",

Resting state networks are known to undergo substantial reorganization from childhood to adulthood, but whether distinct cortical rhythms, which are generated by separable neural mechanisms and are often manifested abnormally in psychiatric conditions, mediate maturation differentially, remains unknown. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to map frequency band specific maturation of resting state networks from age 7 to 29 in 162 participants (31 independent), we found significant changes with age in networks mediated by the beta (13-30Hz) and gamma (31-80Hz) bands. More specifically, gamma band mediated networks followed an expected asymptotic trajectory, but beta band mediated networks followed a linear trajectory. Network integration increased with age in gamma band mediated networks, while local segregation increased with age in beta band mediated networks. Spatially, the hubs that changed in importance with age in the beta band mediated networks had relatively little overlap with those that showed the greatest changes in the gamma band mediated networks. These findings are relevant for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of cortical maturation, in both typical and atypical development.",

Correlated signals are known to facilitate multisensory integration and binding. We sought to further elucidate the nature of this relationship, hypothesizing that multisensory perception will vary with the strength of audiovisual correlation. Human participants detected near-threshold amplitude modulations in auditory and/or visual stimuli. During audiovisual trials, the frequency and phase of auditory modulations were varied, producing signals with a range of correlations. After accounting for individual differences which likely reflect relative temporal processing abilities of participants auditory and visual systems, we found that multisensory perception varied linearly with strength of correlation. Diffusion modelling confirmed this and revealed that correlation is supplied to the decisional system as sensory evidence. These data implicate correlation as an important cue in audiovisual feature integration and binding and suggest correlational strength as an important factor for flexibility in these processes.",

We study rules governing responses to multiple objects by cells in two category-selective regions of macaque IT cortex, the middle lateral face patch (ML) and the middle body patch (MB). We find that responses of single ML and MB cells to pairs of objects could be explained by the widely-accepted framework of normalization, with one added ingredient: homogeneous category selectivity of neighboring neurons forming the normalization pool. This rule leads to winner-take-all, contralateral-take-all, or weighted averaging behavior in single cells, depending on the category, spatial configuration, and relative contrast of the two objects. The winner-take-all behavior suggests a potential mechanism for clutter-invariant representation of face and bodies under certain conditions.",

Built on empirical data, the model accounts for the natural emergence of 3D place, border and grid-cells as well as a new type of previously undescribed spatial cell type which we call plane cells. It further explains the plausible reason behind the place and grid-cell anisotropic coding that has been observed in rodents and the potential discrepancy with the predicted periodic coding during 3D volumetric navigation. Lastly, it provides evidence for the importance of unsupervised learning rules in guiding the formation of higher dimensional cognitive maps.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma, a protozoan parasite of cats, infects many species of intermediate and paratenic hosts, including about one-third of humans worldwide. After a short phase of acute infection, the tissue cysts containing slowly dividing bradyzoites are formed in various organs and toxoplasmosis proceeds spontaneously in its latent form. In immunocompetent subjects, latent toxoplasmosis was considered asymptomatic. However, dozens of studies performed on animals and humans in the past twenty years have shown that it is accompanied by a broad spectrum of specific behavioural, physiological and even morphological changes. In human hosts, the changes often go in the opposite direction in men and women, and are mostly weaker or non-existent in Rh-positive subjects. Here, we searched for the indices of lower endurance of the infected subjects by examining the performance of nearly five hundred university students tested for toxoplasmosis and Rh phenotype in two tests, a weight holding test and a grip test. The results confirmed the existence of a negative association of latent toxoplasmosis with the performance of students, especially Rh-negative men, in these tests. Surprisingly, but in an accordance with some already published data, Toxoplasma-infected, Rh-positive subjects expressed a higher, rather than lower, performance in our endurance tests. Therefore, the results only partly support the hypothesis for the lower endurance of Toxoplasma infected subjects as the performance of Rh-positive subjects (representing majority of population) correlated positively with the Toxoplasma infection.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophil activation has a pathogenic effect in inflammatory diseases. Protein kinase B (PKB)/AKT regulates diverse cellular responses. However, the significance of AKT in neutrophilic inflammation is still not well understood. Here, we identified CLLV-1 as a novel AKT inhibitor. CLLV-1 inhibited respiratory burst, degranulation, chemotaxis, and AKT phosphorylation in activated human neutrophils and dHL-60 cells. Significantly, CLLV-1 blocked AKT activity and covalently reacted with AKT Cys310 in vitro. The AKT309-313 peptide-CLLV-1 adducts were determined by NMR or mass spectrometry assay. The alkylation agent-conjugated AKT (reduced form) level was also inhibited by CLLV-1. Additionally, CLLV-1 ameliorated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice. CLLV-1 acts as a covalent allosteric AKT inhibitor by targeting AKT Cys310 to restrain inflammatory responses in human neutrophils and LPS-induced ALI in vivo. Our findings provide a mechanistic framework for redox modification of AKT that may serve as a novel pharmacological target to alleviate neutrophilic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveExcessive alcohol consumption is a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. However, knowledge of the biological factors that influence ad libitum alcohol intake may be incomplete. Two large studies recently linked variants in the KLB locus with levels of alcohol intake in humans. KLB encodes {beta}-klotho, co-receptor for the liver-derived hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). In mice, FGF21 reduces alcohol intake, and human Fgf21 variants are enriched among heavy drinkers. Thus, the liver may limit alcohol consumption by secreting FGF21. However, whether full-length, active plasma FGF21 (FGF21 (1-181)) levels in humans increase acutely or sub-chronically in response to alcohol ingestion is uncertain.\\n\\nMethodsWe recruited 10 healthy, fasted male subjects to receive an oral water or alcohol bolus with concurrent blood sampling for FGF21 (1-181) measurement in plasma. In addition, we measured circulating FGF21 (1-181) levels, liver stiffness, triglyceride, and other metabolic parameters in three healthy Danish men before and after consuming an average of 22.6 beers/person/day (4.4 g/kg/day of ethanol) for three days during Oktoberfest 2017 in Munich, Germany. We further correlated fasting FGF21 (1-181) levels in 49 healthy, non-alcoholic subjects of mixed sex with self-reports of alcohol-related behaviors, emotional responses, and problems. Finally, we characterized the effect of recombinant human FGF21 injection on ad libitum alcohol intake in mice.\\n\\nResultsWe show that alcohol ingestion (25.3 grams or ~2.5 standard drinks) acutely increases plasma levels of FGF21 (1-181) 3.4-fold in fasting humans. We also find that binge drinking for three days at Oktoberfest is associated with a 2.1-fold increase in baseline FGF21 (1-181) levels, in contrast to minor deteriorations in metabolic and hepatic biomarkers. However, basal FGF21 (1-181) levels were not correlated with differences in alcohol-related behaviors, emotional responses, or problems in our non-alcoholic subjects. Finally, we show that once-daily injection of recombinant human FGF21 reduces ad libitum alcohol intake by 21% in mice.\\n\\nConclusionsFGF21 (1-181) is markedly increased in circulation by both acute and sub-chronic alcohol intake in humans, and reduces alcohol intake in mice. These observations are consistent with a role for FGF21 as an endocrine inhibitor of alcohol appetite in humans.",

    "abstract": "Cervical spondylosis(CS), a most common orthopedic diseases, is mainly identified by the doctors judgment from the clinical symptoms and cervical change provided by expensive instruments in hospital. Owing to the development of the surface electromyography(sEMG) technique and artificial intelligence, we proposed a convenient non-harm CS intelligent identify method EasiCNCSII, including the sEMG data acquisition and the CS identification. For the convenience and efficiency of data acquisition with the limited testable muscles provided by the sEMG technology, we proposed a data acquisition method based on the relationship between muscle activity pattern, the tendons theory and CS etiology. It is easily performed in less than 20 minutes, even outside the hospital. Faced with the challenge of high-dimension and the weak availability, the 3-tier model EasiAI is developed to intelligently identify CS. The common features and new features are extracted from raw sEMG data in first tier. The EasiRF is proposed in second tier to further reduce the data dimension and improve the performance. With the limited and weakly available data, the gradient boosted regression tree is developed in third tier to effectively identify CS. The EasiAI achieve the best performance with 91.02% in accuracy, 97.14% in sensitivity, and 81.43% in specificity compared with 4 common machine learning classification model, validating the EasiCNCSII effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Any conformational ensemble of biopolymers, whether they are proteins or chromosomes, can be described using contact matrices derived from experimental or computational studies. One powerful approach to extract meaningful information from these contact matrices is to perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the covariance matrix of the contact data. Indeed, PCA on Hi-C chromosome contact matrices has revealed the spatial segregation of active and inactive chromatin. Separately, PCA on contact matrices from snapshots of protein conformations has characterized correlated fluctuations of protein domains. However, despite the similarities of these data and analyses, there has been little synergy between the PCA approaches and the comparison of resulting biological insights obtained for protein and chromosome structures. We note that, to date, different styles of analyses were applied exclusively to each biomolecule type: explicit contact correlation analysis (E-PCA) for proteins and implicit contact correlation (I-PCA) for chromosomes. In this work, we compare the results of applying both methods to both classes of biopolymers. While I-PCA reveals only average features of 3D chromosome structure, we find that applying E-PCA to an ensemble of chromosome structures from microscopy data reveals the dominant motion (concerted fluctuation) of the chromosome. Applying E-PCA to Hi-C data across the human blood cell lineage isolates the aspects of chromosome structure that most strongly differentiate cell types. Conversely, when we apply I-PCA to simulation snapshots of two protein complexes, the major component reports the consensus features of the structure, while the previously applied E-PCA characterizes correlated deviations from the mean structure.",

    "abstract": "Background\\n\\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). We recently reported that glycemic control in patients with T2D can be significantly improved through a continuous care intervention (CCI) including nutritional ketosis. The purpose of this study was to examine CVD risk factors in this cohort.\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nWe investigated CVD risk factors in patients with T2D who participated in a one year open label, non-randomized, controlled study. The CCI group (n = 262) received treatment from a health coach and medical provider. A usual care (UC) group (n = 87) was independently recruited to track customary T2D progression. Circulating biomarkers of cholesterol metabolism and inflammation, blood pressure (BP), carotid intima media thickness (cIMT), multi-factorial risk scores and medication use were examined.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nThe CCI group consisted of 262 patients (baseline mean(SD): age 54(8) y, BMI 40.4(8.8) kg/m2). Intention-to-treat analysis (% change) revealed the following at 1-year with P values < 0.0019 indicating statistical significance after adjustment for multiple comparisons: total LDL-particles (LDL-P) (-4.9%, P=0.02), small LDL-P (-20.8%, P=1.2x10-12), LDL-P size (+1.1%, P=6.0x10-10), ApoB (-1.6%, P=0.37), ApoA1 (+9.8%, P<10-16), ApoB/ApoA1 ratio (-9.5%, P=1.9x10-7), triglyceride/HDL-C ratio (-29.1%, P<10-16), large VLDL-P (-38.9%, P=4.2x10-15), and LDL-C (+9.9%, P=4.9x10-5). Additional effects were reductions in blood pressure, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and white blood cell count (all P<1x10-7) while cIMT was unchanged. The 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score decreased -11.9% (P=4.9x10-5). Antihypertensive medication use was discontinued in 11.4 % of CCI participants (P=5.3x10-5). The UC group of 87 patients (baseline mean(SD): age 52(10)y, BMI 36.7(7.2) kg/m2) showed no significant changes. After adjusting for baseline differences when comparing CCI and UC groups, significant improvements for the CCI group included small LDL-P, ApoA1, triglyceride/HDL-C ratio, HDL-C, hs-CRP, and ASCVD score. The CCI group showed a greater rise in LDL-C.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nA continuous care treatment including nutritional ketosis in patients with T2D improved most biomarkers of CVD risk after one year. The increase in LDL-cholesterol appeared limited to the large LDL subfraction. LDL particle size increased, total LDL-P and ApoB were unchanged, and inflammation and blood pressure decreased.\\n\\nTrial registration\\n\\nClinicaltrials.gov: NCT02519309.

    "abstract": "Patterns of trait distribution among competing species can potentially reveal the processes that allow them to coexist. It has been recently proposed that competition may drive the spontaneous emergence of niches comprising clusters of similar species, in contrast with the dominant paradigm of greater-than-chance species differences. However, current clustering theory relies largely on heuristic rather than mechanistic models. Furthermore, studies of models incorporating demographic stochasticity and immigration, two key players in community assembly, did not observe clusters. Here we demonstrate clustering under partitioning of resources, partitioning of environmental gradients, and a competition-colonization tradeoff. We show that clusters are robust to demographic stochasticity, and can persist under immigration. While immigration may sustain clusters that are otherwise transient, too much dilutes the pattern. In order to detect and quantify clusters in nature, we introduce and validate metrics which have no free parameters nor require arbitrary trait binning, and weigh species by their abundances rather than relying on a presence-absence count. By generalizing beyond the circumstances where clusters have been observed, our study contributes to establishing them as an update to classical trait patterning theory.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySpecies traits determine how they compete with each other. As such, patterns in the distributions of traits in a community of competing species may reveal the processes responsible for coexistence. One central idea in theoretical ecology is that the strength of competition relates to similarity in species needs and strategies, and therefore if competition plays out at short timescales, coexisting species should be more different than expected by chance. However, recent theory suggests that competition may lead species to temporarily self-organize into groups with similar traits. Here we show that this clustering is a generic feature of competitive dynamics, which is robust to demographic stochasticity and can be indefinitely maintained by immigration. We show that clustering arises whether species coexist by partitioning resources, environmental preferences, or through tradeoffs in life-history strategies. We introduce and validate metrics that, given species traits and abundances, determine whether they are clustered, and if so, how many clusters occur. By showing the generality of self-organized species clusters and providing a tools for their detection, our study contributes to updating classical ideas about how competition shapes communities, and motivates searches for them in nature.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory health effects such as mesothelioma, silicosis, and lung cancer have been shown to be associated with working in the taconite mining industry. Taconite workers may also have elevated risks from cardiovascular disease (CVD), although the relationship of CVD to dust exposures at these mines has not been well-studied. Motivated by evidence from environmental epidemiological studies and occupational cohorts that have implicated the effects of fine particulates with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, we conducted an air monitoring campaign to characterize fine aerosol concentrations at 91 locations across six taconite mines using an array of direct-reading instruments to obtain measurements of mass concentrations (PM2.5 or particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 m, and respirable particulate matter or RPM), alveolar-deposited surface area concentrations (ADSA), particle number concentrations (PN), and particle size distributions. To analyze these data, we fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with an AR(1) correlation structure to estimate exposure while accounting for temporal correlation. The highest estimated geometric means (GMs) were observed in the pelletizing and concentrating departments (pelletizing maintenance, balling drum operator, and concentrator operator) for PM2.5 and RPM. ADSA and PN generally had highest GMs in the pelletizing department, which processed large amounts of powder-like particles into iron pellets. The within-location variability (GSD_WL) generally ranged from 1 to 3 for all exposure metrics, except for a few locations which indicated changes of activities that caused the exposures to change. Between-location variability (GSD_BL) estimates were generally higher than GSD_WL, indicating larger differences in exposure levels at different locations between mines than at individual locations over the course of several hours. Ranking between PM2.5 and RPM generally agree with each other, whereas ADSA and PN were more consistent with each other, with some overlap with PM2.5 and RPM. Differences in ranking these groups may have potential implication for occupational epidemiological studies that rely on exposure information to detect an exposure-response relationship for various job groups. Future epidemiological studies investigating fine aerosol exposures and health risks in occupational settings are encouraged to use multiple metrics to see how they influence health outcomes risk.",

Under the R&D Blueprint Plan of Action, the World Health Organization (WHO) has convened a group of experts to agree on standard procedures to rapidly evaluate experimental vaccines during PHEs while maintaining the highest scientific and ethical standards. The Blueprint priority diseases, selected for their likelihood to cause PHEs and the lack of adequate medical countermeasures, were used to frame our methodological discussions. Here, we outline major vaccine study designs to be used in PHEs and summarize high-level recommendations for their use in this setting. We recognize that the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the Blueprint priority diseases may be highly uncertain and that the unique characteristics of the vaccines and outbreak settings may affect our study design. To address these challenges, our group underscores the need for novel, flexible, and responsive trial designs. We conclude that assignment to study groups using randomization is a key principle underlying rigorous study design and should be utilized except in exceptional circumstances. Advance planning for vaccine trial designs is critical for rapid and effective response to a PHE and to advance knowledge to address and mitigate future PHEs.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryAs part of the WHO research and development Blueprint for action to prevent epidemics, we describe key considerations for the design and analysis of trials and studies to evaluate experimental vaccines during public health emergencies.",

The spraying schedule suggested by the fuzzy-modified GT risk index was tested in eight site-years. Overall, the fuzzy-modified risk index maintained comparable levels of disease control as both the original model and a calendar based treatment, and had significantly less disease than the untreated control.

The cut-points approach to segment accelerometer data is widely used in physical activity research but requires resource expensive calibration studies and does not make it easy to explore the information that can be gained for a variety of raw data metrics. To address these limitations, we present a data-driven approach for segmenting and clustering the accelerometer data using unsupervised machine learning.\\n\\nMethodsThe data used came from five hundred fourteen-year-old participants from the Millennium cohort study who wore an accelerometer (GENEActiv) on their wrist on one weekday and one weekend day. A Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM), configured to identify a maximum of ten behavioral states from five second averaged acceleration with and without addition of x, y, and z-angles, was used for segmenting and clustering of the data. A cut-points approach was used as comparison.\\n\\nResultsTime spent in behavioral states with or without angle metrics constituted eight and five principal components to reach 95% explained variance, respectively; in comparison four components were identified with the cut-points approach. In the HSMM with acceleration and angle as input, the distributions for acceleration in the states showed similar groupings as the cut-points categories, while more variety was seen in the distribution of angles.\\n\\nConclusionOur unsupervised classification approach learns a construct of human behavior based on the data it observes, without the need for resource expensive calibration studies, has the ability to combine multiple data metrics, and offers a higher dimensional description of physical behavior.

    "abstract": "The critical role of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in embryonic development, malignant transformation, and tumor progression has been well studied in normal and cancerous tissues and cells. Interestingly, EMT has also been reported to play a key role in the early progression of several retinal degenerative diseases, including scarring associated proliferative vitro-retinopathy (PVR), choroidal neo-vascularization induced \\\"wet\\\" age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Despite these studies, many questions remain unexplored regarding EMT-associated retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration and dysfunction. We hypothesize that RPE cells undergo EMT prior to cell death during the progression of atrophic \\\"dry\\\" AMD. Utilizing human stem cell-derived RPE (hRPE) as a model to study RPE EMT, we optimized two independent but complementary RPE EMT induction systems: 1) enzymatic dissociation of hRPE monolayer cultures and 2) co-treatment of hRPE monolayer cultures with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}) and the inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-). To further understand the molecular mechanisms of RPE EMT regulation, we performed an RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) time course examination across 48 hours beginning with EMT induction. Our transcriptome profiling provides a comprehensive quantification of dynamic signaling events and associated biological pathways underlying RPE EMT and reveals an intriguing significance for widespread dysregulation of multiple axon guidance molecules in this process.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by T cell-mediated destruction of the insulin-producing {beta}cells of the pancreatic islets. Among the loci associated with T1D risk, those most predisposing are found in the MHC region. HLA-B*39:06 is the most predisposing class I MHC allele and is associated with an early age of onset. To establish an NOD mouse model for the study of HLA-B*39:06, we expressed it in the absence of murine class I MHC. HLA-B*39:06 was able to mediate the development of CD8 T cells, support lymphocytic infiltration of the islets, and confer T1D susceptibility. Because reduced thymic insulin expression is associated with increased T1D risk in patients, we incorporated this in our model as well, finding that HLA-B*39:06-transgenic NOD mice with reduced thymic insulin expression have an earlier age of disease onset and a higher overall prevalence as compared to littermates with typical thymic insulin expression. This was despite virtually indistinguishable blood insulin levels, T cell subset percentages, and TCR V{beta} family usage, indicating that reduced thymic insulin expression does not impact T cell development on a global scale. Rather, we propose that it allows the thymic escape of insulin-reactive HLA-B*39:06-restricted T cells which participate in {beta} cell destruction. We also found that in mice expressing either HLA-B*39:06 or HLA-A*02:01 in the absence of murine class I MHC, HLA transgene identity alters TCR V{beta} usage, which may contribute to varying diabetogenic CD8 T cell repertoires in the presence of different HLA class I alleles.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for a number of different human infections and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa infections are difficult to treat due to a number of antibiotic resistance mechanisms and the organisms propensity to form multicellular biofilms. Epidemic strains of P. aeruginosa often dominate within the lungs of individual CF patients, but how they achieve this is poorly understood. One of the ways strains of P. aeruginosa can compete, is by producing chromosomally encoded bacteriocins, called pyocins. Three major classes of pyocin have been identified in P. aeruginosa: soluble pyocins (S-types) and tailocins (R- and F-types). In this study, we investigated the distribution of S- and R-type pyocins in 24 clinical strains isolated from individual CF patients and then focused on understanding their roles on inter-strain competition. We found that (i) each strain produced only one R-pyocin type, but the number of S-pyocins varied between strains; (ii) R-pyocins were generally important for strain dominance during competition assays in planktonic cultures and biofilm communities in strains with both disparate R and S pyocin sub-types. (iii) purified R-pyocins demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against established biofilms. Our work provides support for a key role played by R-pyocins in the competition between P. aeruginosa strains, and may help explain why certain strains and lineages of P. aeruginosa dominate and displace others during CF lung infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of exploiting R-pyocins for therapeutic gains in an era when antibiotic resistance is a global concern.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEA major clinical problem caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is chronic biofilm infection of the lungs in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Epidemic P. aeruginosa strains dominate and displace others during CF infection, but these intra-species interactions remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that R-pyocins (bacterocins) are important factors in driving competitive interactions in biofilms between P. aeruginosa strains isolated from different CF patients. In addition, we found that these phage-like pyocins are inhibitory against mature biofilms of susceptible strains. This highlights the potential of R-pyocins as antimicrobial and antibiofilm agents, at a time when new antimicrobial therapies are desperately needed.",

    "abstract": "We recently described an unconventional mode of gene regulation in budding yeast by which transcriptional and translational interference were used in an integrated manner to down-regulate protein expression. Developmentally timed transcriptional interference inhibited production of a well translated mRNA isoform and resulted in the production of an mRNA isoform containing inhibitory upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that blocked translation of the ORF. Transcriptional interference and uORF-based translational repression are established mechanisms outside of yeast, but whether this type of integrated regulation was conserved was unknown. Here we find that, indeed, a similar type of regulation occurs at the locus for the human oncogene MDM2. We observe evidence of transcriptional interference between the two MDM2 promoters, which produce a poorly translated distal promoter-derived uORF-containing mRNA isoform and a well-translated proximal promoter-derived transcript. Down-regulation of distal promoter activity markedly up-regulates proximal promoter-driven expression and results in local reduction of histone H3K36 trimethylation. Moreover, we observe that this transcript toggling between the two MDM2 isoforms naturally occurs during human embryonic stem cell differentiation programs.",

We use single-molecule Foerster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to reveal Cas9 target search mechanism with nanometer sensitivity. We have developed single-molecule assays to monitor transient interactions of Cas9 and DNA in real time. Our study shows that Cas9 interacts with the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence weakly, yet probing neighboring sequences via lateral diffusion. This dynamic mode of interactions leads to translocation of Cas9 to another PAM nearby and consequently an on-target sequence. We propose a model in which lateral diffusion competes with 3-dimensional diffusion and thus might aid PAM finding and consequently on-target binding.",

The initial state-vector has a 1 at the position corresponding to the primary tumor, and 0s elsewhere (no initial metastases). The spread of the disease to other sites (metastases) is modeled as a directed random walk on the Markov network, moving from site to site with the estimated transition probabilities obtained from longitudinal data. The stochastic model produces probabilistic predictions of the likelihood of each metastatic pathway and corresponding time sequences obtained from computer Monte Carlo simulations.

    "abstract": "Haemostatic platelet function is intimately linked to cellular mechanics and cytoskeletal morphology. How cytoskeletal reorganizations give rise to a highly contractile phenotype that is necessary for clot contraction remains poorly understood. To elucidate this process in vitro, we developed a morphometric screen to quantify the spatial organization of actin fibres and vinculin adhesion sites in single spread platelets. Platelets from healthy donors predominantly adopted a bipolar morphology on fibrinogen and fibronectin, whereas distinguishable, more isotropic phenotypes on collagen type I or laminin. Specific integrin IIb{beta}3 inhibitors induced an isotropic cytoskeletal organization in a dose-dependent manner. The same trend was observed with decreasing matrix stiffness. Circular F-actin arrangements in platelets from a patient with type II Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) were consistent with the residual activity of a small number of IIb{beta}3 integrins. Cytoskeletal morphologies in vitro can thus inform about platelet adhesion receptor identity and functionality, and integrin IIb{beta}3 mechanotransduction fundamentally determines the adoption of a highly contractile bipolar phenotype. Super-resolution microscopy and electron microscopies further confirmed the stress fibre-like contractile actin architecture. For the first time, our assay allows the unbiased and quantitative assessment of platelet morphologies and could help to identify defective platelet contractility contributing to elusive bleeding phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "During development, neuronal cells extend an axon towards their target destination in response to a cue to form a properly functioning nervous system. Rho proteins, Ras-related small GTPases that regulate cytoskeletal organization and dynamics, cell adhesion, and motility, are known to regulate axon guidance. Despite extensive knowledge about canonical Rho proteins (RhoA/Rac1/Cdc42), little is known about the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) atypical Cdc42-like family members CHW-1 and CRP-1 in regards to axon pathfinding and neuronal migration. chw-1(Chp/Wrch) encodes a protein that resembles human Chp (Wrch-2/RhoV) and Wrch-1 (RhoU), and crp-1 encodes for a protein that resembles TC10 and TCL. Here, we show that chw-1 works redundantly with crp-1 and cdc-42 in axon guidance. Furthermore, proper levels of chw-1 expression and activity are required for proper axon guidance. When examining CHW-1 GTPase mutants, we found that the native CHW-1 protein is likely partially activated, and mutations at a conserved residue (position 12 using Ras numbering, position 18 in CHW-1) alter axon guidance and neural migration. Additionally, we showed that chw-1 genetically interacts with the guidance receptor sax-3 in PDE neurons. Finally, in VD/DD motor neurons, chw-1 works downstream of sax-3 to control axon guidance. In summary, this is the first study implicating the atypical Rho GTPases chw-1 and crp-1 in axon guidance. Furthermore, this is the first evidence of genetic interaction between chw-1 and the guidance receptor sax-3. These data suggest that chw-1 is likely acting downstream and/or in parallel to sax-3 in axon guidance.",

    "abstract": "C. elegans heterochronic genes determine the timing of expression of specific cell fates in particular stages of developing larva. However, their broader roles in coordinating developmental events across diverse tissues has been less well investigated. Here, we show that loss of lin-28, a central heterochronic regulator of hypodermal development, causes reduced fertility associated with abnormal somatic gonad morphology. In particular, the abnormal spermatheca-uterine valve morphology of lin-28(lf) hermaphrodites trap embryos in the spermatheca, which disrupts ovulation and causes embryonic lethality. The same genes that act downstream of lin-28 in the regulation of hypodermal developmental timing also act downstream of lin-28 in somatic gonad morphogenesis and fertility. Importantly, we find that hypodermal expression, but not somatic gonadal expression, of lin-28 is sufficient for restoring normal somatic gonad morphology in lin-28(lf) mutants. We propose that the abnormal somatic gonad morphogenesis of lin-28(lf) hermaphrodites results from temporal discoordination between the accelerated hypodermal development and normally timed somatic gonad development. Thus, our findings exemplify how a cell-intrinsic developmental timing program can also control cell non-autonomous signaling critical for proper development of other interacting tissues.",

    "abstract": "Understanding drivers of permafrost microbial community composition is critical for understanding permafrost microbiology and predicting ecosystem responses to thaw, however studies describing ecological controls on these communities are lacking. We hypothesize that permafrost communities are uniquely shaped by constraints imposed by prolonged freezing, and decoupled from factors that influence non-permafrost soil communities. To test this hypothesis, we characterized patterns of environmental variation and microbial community composition in permafrost across an Alaskan boreal forest landscape. We used null modeling to estimate the relative importance of selective and neutral assembly processes on community composition, and identified environmental factors influencing ecological selection through regression and structural equation modeling (SEM). Proportionally, the strongest process influencing community composition was dispersal limitation (0.36), exceeding the influence of homogenous selection (0.21), variable selection (0.16), and homogenizing dispersal (0.05). Fe(II) content was the most important factor explaining variable selection, and was significantly associated with total selection by univariate regression (R2=0.14, p=0.003). SEM supported a model in which Fe(II) content mediated influences of the Gibbs free energy of the organic matter pool and organic acid concentration on total selection. These findings reveal that the processes shaping microbial communities in permafrost are distinct from those in non-permafrost soils, as the stability of the permafrost environment imposes dispersal and thermodynamic constraints on permafrost communities. Models of permafrost community composition will need to account for these unique drivers in order to predict community characteristics across permafrost landscapes, and in efforts to understand how pre-thaw conditions will influence post-thaw ecological and biogeochemical processes.",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive evidence that biodiversity promotes plant community productivity, progress towards understanding the mechanistic basis of this effect remains slow, impeding the development of predictive ecological theory and agricultural applications. Here, we analysed non-additive interactions between genetically divergent Arabidopsis accessions in experimental plant communities. By combining methods from ecology and genetics, we identified a major effect locus at which allelic differences between individuals increases above-ground productivity of communities. In experiments with near-isogenic lines, we show that this diversity effect acts independently of other genomic regions and can be resolved to a single region representing less than 0.3% of the genome. Using plant-soil-feedback experiments, we also demonstrate that allelic diversity causes genotype-specific soil legacy responses in a consecutive growing period, even after the original community has disappeared. Our work thus suggests that positive diversity effects can be linked to single Mendelian factors, and that a range of complex community properties can have a simple cause. This may pave the way to a better understanding of diversity effects, and to novel breeding strategies, focussing on phenotypic properties that manifest themselves beyond isolated individuals, i.e. at a higher level of biological organisation.",

    "abstract": "In 2011-2017 an unusually high number of invasive pests new to European Russia were detected for the first time in Sochi on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus. We present the first reports of two pests new for the Caucasus and European Russia found in 2017: Drosophila suzukii (a pest of fruit, included to EPPO A2 list) and Otiorhynchus armadillo (a pest of agricultural and ornamental plants). Other recently established insects: a polyphagous pest Halyomorpha halys (first record in 2014); pests of palm trees included to EPPO A2 list: Paysandisia archon (2014) and Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (2012); a pest of Solanaceae: Epitrix hirtipennis (2013); a pest of ornamental flowers: Luperomorpha xanthodera (2016); a pest of soybeans: Medythia nigrobilineata (2016); a pest of wine production: Harmonia axyridis (2012); a pest of strawberry: Stelidota geminata (2013); pests of Eucalyptus: Ophelimus maskelli (2011), Glycaspis bremblecomblei (2014), Leptocybe invasa (2014); a pest of Cupressaceae: Lamprodila festiva (2013); a pest of Gleditsia: Dasineura gleditchiae (2011), a pest of Buxus: Cydalima perspectalis (2012); a pest of Albizia: Acizzia jamatonica (2014); a pest of Cercis: Cacopsylla pulchella (2014). Probably most of insects were introduced with imported planting material during the landscaping of the city of Sochi in preparation for the Olympic Games (held in 2014). Quarantine measures should be taken to prevent dispersal of these pests to other regions of the Caucasus and countries of the Black Sea region. Attention should be paid to a new pest for Europe Medythia nigrobilineata.",

    "abstract": "Histone chaperones, chromatin remodelers, and histone modifying complexes play a critical role in alleviating the nucleosomal barrier. Here, we have examined the role of two highly conserved yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) histone chaperones, FACT and Spt6, in regulating transcription and histone occupancy. We show that the H3 tail contributes to the recruitment of FACT to coding sequences in a manner dependent on acetylation. We found that deleting a H3 HAT Gcn5 or mutating lysines on the H3 tail impairs FACT recruitment at ADH1 and ARG1 genes. However, deleting the H4 tail or mutating the H4 lysines failed to dampen FACT occupancy in coding regions. Additionally, we show that FACT-depletion greatly reduces Pol II occupancy in the 5 ends genome-wide. By contrast, Spt6-depletion led to reduction in Pol II occupancy towards the 3 end, in a manner dependent on the gene-length. Severe transcription and histone eviction defects were also observed in a strain that was impaired for Spt6 recruitment (spt6{Delta}202) and depleted of FACT. Importantly, the severity of the defect strongly correlated with WT Pol II occupancies at these genes, indicating critical roles of Spt6 and Spt16 in promoting high-level transcription. Collectively, our study shows cooperation, as well as redundancy between chaperones, FACT and Spt6, in regulating transcription and chromatin in coding regions of transcribed genes.",

A number of methods have been proposed which mainly focusing on the setting of two-group comparison. We develop a DMR detecting method MethCP for WGBS data, which is applicable for a wide range of experimental designs beyond the two-group comparisons, such as time-course data. MethCP identifies DMRs based on change point detection, which naturally segments the genome and provides region-level differential analysis. For simple two-group comparison, we show that our method outperforms developed methods in accurately detecting the complete DM region on a simulated dataset and an Arabidopsis dataset. Moreover, we show that MethCP is capable of detecting wide regions with small effect sizes, which can be common in some settings but existing techniques are poor in detecting such DMRs. We also demonstrate the use of MethCP for time-course data on another dataset following methylation throughout seed germination in Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of drug-resistance in Enterococcus faecalis V583 through acquisition of resistance genes has been correlated to the absence of CRISPR-loci. Here, the presence of a bona-fide CRISPR locus in E. faecalis V583 (Accid:NC_004668.1) at 2238156 with a single 20 nt repeat is demonstrated. The presence of a putative endonuclease Cas1 13538 nucleotides away from the repeat substantiates this claim. This Cas1 (628 aa) is highly homologous (Eval:5e-34) to a Cas1 from Pseudanabaena biceps (Accid:WP 009625648.1, 697 aa), which belongs to the enigmatic family of RT-CRISPR locus. Such significant similarity to a Cas protein, the presence of a topoisomerase, other DUF (domain of unknown function) proteins as is often seen in CRISPR loci, and other hypothetical proteins indicates that this is a bona-fide CRISPR locus. Further corroboration is provided by expression of both the repeat and the Cas1 gene in existing RNA-seq data (SRX3438611). Since so little is known of even well-studied species like E. faecalis V583 having many hypothetical proteins, computational absence of evidence should not be taken as evidence of absence (both crisprfinder and PILER-CR do not report this as a CRISPR locus). It is unlikely that bacteria would completely give up defense against its primeval enemies (viruses) to bolster its fight against the newly introduced antibiotics.",

On the premise that the integration of a replicon within the cell cycle is key to deciphering its essential nature, we show that the content in genes involved in the replication, partition and segregation of the replicons and in the cell cycle discriminates the bacterial replicons into chromosomes, plasmids, and another class of essential genomic elements that function as chromosomes. These latter do not derive directly from plasmids. Rather, they arise from the fission of a multi-replicon molecule corresponding to the co-integrated and rearranged ancestral chromosome and plasmid. All essential replicons in a distributed genome are thus neochromosomes. Having a distributed genome appears to extend and accelerate the exploration of the bacterial genome evolutionary landscape, producing complex regulation and leading to novel eco-phenotypes and species diversification.",

    "abstract": "Adult organisms may \\\"prime\\\" their offspring for environmental change through a number of genetic and non-genetic mechanisms, termed parental effects. Some coral species can alter their thermal tolerance by shuffling the proportions of Symbiodinium types within their endosymbiotic communities, but it is unclear if this plasticity can be transferred to offspring in corals that have maternal symbiont transmission. We evaluated symbiont community composition in tagged colonies of Montipora digitata from Orpheus Island, Australia, over two successive annual spawning seasons, the second of which overlapped with the 2016 mass coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef. We applied amplicon sequencing of the ITS2 locus to samples of four families (parent colonies and 10-12 eggs per family) to characterize their potential for symbiont shuffling and to determine if shuffled abundances were preserved in gametes. Symbiont cell densities and photochemical efficiencies of the symbionts photosystem II differed significantly among adults in 2016, suggesting differential responses to increased temperatures. Although abundances of the dominant symbiont haplotype, a representative of clade C15, did not differ among families or over time, low-abundance (\\\"background\\\") ITS2 types differed more among years (2015 vs. 2016) than between life stages (parent vs. offspring). Results indicate that background symbiont shuffling can occur in a canonically  stable symbiosis, and that such plastic changes to the symbiont community are heritable. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that shuffled Symbiodinium communities can be inherited by early life-history stages and supports the hypothesis that plastic changes in microbial communities may serve as a mechanism of rapid coral acclimation to changing environmental conditions.",

Here we present a method for rearing axenic (bacteria free) Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which will greatly facilitate mechanistic studies documenting the structure and function of the microbiome. Through feeding sterilized larvae agar plugs containing attenuated Escherichia coli, mosquito development was observed in the absence of living bacteria. Axenic larvae were capable of full development into adults, which laid eggs that were subsequently hatched. However, axenic mosquitoes exhibited delayed development time and reduced egg clutch size in comparison to bacterially colonized mosquitoes. These findings suggest that mosquito development is not dependent on live bacteria, but their phenotype is modulated by the presence of microorganisms. This axenic system offers a new tool in which the mosquito microbiome can be systematically manipulated for a deeper understanding of microbiome host interactions.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) binds its host cell using the major viral surface protein hemagglutinin (HA). HA recognizes sialic acid, a plasma membrane glycan that functions as the specific primary attachment factor (AF). Since sialic acid alone cannot fulfill a signaling function, the virus needs to activate downstream factors to trigger endocytic uptake. Recently, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the receptor-tyrosine kinase family, was shown to be activated by and transmit IAV entry signals. However, how IAV engages and activates EGFR remains largely unclear.\\n\\nWe used multicolor super-resolution microscopy to study the lateral organization of both IAV attachment factors and its functional receptor at the scale of the IAV particle. Intriguingly, quantitative cluster analysis revealed that AF and EGFR are organized in partially overlapping submicrometer clusters in the apical plasma membrane of A549 cells. Within AF domains, which are distinct from microvilli, the local AF concentration, a parameter that directly influences virus-cell binding, reaches on average 10-fold the background concentration and tends to increase towards the cluster center, thereby representing a multivalent virus-binding platform. Using our experimentally measured cluster characteristics, we simulated virus diffusion on a membrane, revealing that the distinct mobility pattern of IAVs is dominated by the local AF concentration, consistent with live cell single-virus tracking data. In contrast to AF, EGFR resides in clusters of rather low molecular density. Virus binding activates EGFR, but interestingly, this process occurs without a major lateral EGFR redistribution, instead relying on activation of pre-formed clusters, which we show are long-lived.\\n\\nTaken together, our results provide a quantitative understanding of the initial steps of influenza virus infection. Co-clustering of AF and EGFR permit a cooperative effect of binding and signaling at specific platforms, and thus we relate their spatial organization to their functional role during virus-cell binding and receptor activation.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe plasma membrane is the major interface between a cell and its environment. It is a complex and dynamic organelle that needs to protect as a barrier but also process subtle signals into and out of the cell. For IAV, an enveloped virus, it represents a major obstacle that it needs to overcome during infection as well as the site for the assembly of progeny virus particles. However, the organisation of the plasma membrane in particular the sites of virus interaction at the scale of an infecting particle (length scales < 100 nm) remains largely unknown.\\n\\nSialic acids serve as IAV attachment factors but are not able to transmit signals across the plasma membrane. Receptor tyrosine kinases were identified to be activated upon virus binding and serve as functional receptor. How IAV engages and activates its functional receptors still remains speculative. Here we use super resolution microscopy to study the lateral organization as well as the functional relationship of plasma membrane-bound molecules involved in IAV infection. We find that molecules are organized in submicrometer nanodomains and, in combination with virus diffusion simulations, present a mechanistic view for how IAV first engages with AFs in the plasma membrane to then engage and trigger entry-associated membrane receptors.",

Our mechanistic studies further identify the histone chaperone FACT (Facilitates Chromatin Transcription) as responsible for the deposition of newly synthesized H2A.X. Functionally, FACT potentiates H2A.X-dependent signaling of DNA damage and, together with ANP32E (Acidic Nuclear Phosphoprotein 32 Family Member E), orchestrates a H2A.Z/H2A.X exchange reaction that reshapes the chromatin landscape at repair sites.

    "abstract": "Abstract (174 words)Pumilio (Pum) is a key component of neuron firing-rate homeostasis that maintains stability of neural circuit activity. Whilst Pum is ubiquitously expressed, we understand little about how synaptic excitation regulates its expression. Here, we characterised the Drosophila dpum promoter and identified multiple Myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2)-binding elements. To understand the transactivation capability of dMef2, we cloned 12 dmef2 splice variants and used a luciferase-based assay to monitor dpum promoter activity. Whilst all 12 dMef2 splice variants enhance dpum promoter activity, exon 10-containing variants induce greater transactivation. Previous work shows dPum expression increases with synaptic excitation. However, we observe no change in dmef2 transcript in CNS exposed to picrotoxin (PTX). The lack of activity-dependence is indicative of additional regulation. We identified p300 as a likely candidate. We show that by binding to dMef2, p300 represses dpum transactivation. Significantly, p300 transcript is down-regulated by enhanced synaptic excitation (PTX) which, in turn, increases transcription of dpum through derepression of dMef2. These results suggest the activity-dependent expression of dpum is regulated by an interaction between p300 and dMef2.",

Here, we used calcium imaging in mice running in a tactile virtual reality to investigate modulation of neurons in layer 2/3 (L2/3) and L5 of barrel cortex. About a third of neurons in both layers increased activity during running and concomitant whisking, in the absence of touch. Fewer neurons were modulated by whisking alone (<10%). Whereas L5 neurons responded transiently to wall-touching during running, L2/3 neurons showed sustained activity after touch onset. Consistently, neurons encoding running-with-touch were more abundant in L2/3 compared to L5. Few neurons across layers were also sensitive to abrupt perturbations of tactile flow. We propose that L5 neurons mainly report changes in touch conditions whereas L2/3 neurons continually monitor ongoing tactile stimuli during running.",

    "abstract": "Compared to wakefulness, neuronal activity during non-REM sleep is characterized by a decreased ability to integrate information, but also by the re-emergence of task-related information patterns. To investigate the mechanisms underlying these seemingly opposing phenomena, we measured directed information flow by computing transfer entropy between neuronal spiking activity in three cortical regions and the hippocampus of rats across brain states. State-dependent information flow resulted to be jointly determined by the anatomical distance between neurons and by their functional specialization. We distinguished two regimes, operating at short and long time scales, respectively. From wakefulness to non-REM sleep, transfer entropy at short time scales increased for inter-areal connections between neurons showing behavioral task correlates. Conversely, transfer entropy at long time scales became stronger between non-task modulated neurons and weaker between task- modulated neurons. These results may explain how, during non-REM sleep, a global inter-areal disconnection is compatible with highly specific task-related information transfer.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe brain remains active during deep sleep, yet we still do not know which rules govern information processing between neurons across wakefulness and sleep. Here we provide a first study of how information flow at the level of spiking activity varies as a function of brain state, temporal scale, brain area and behavioral task correlates of single neurons. We found that inter-areal communication at millisecond time scales is enhanced during sleep compared to wakefulness between neurons that code for task information. Conversely, non-modulated neurons showed more prominent communication at longer time scales. These results indicate that multiple, functionally determined communicative architectures coexist in the brain, and provide a novel framework to understand information processing and its consequences during sleep.",

    "abstract": "Vitis vinifera is a climbing vine with wide vessels and high hydraulic conductivity. There is a lack of data on the anatomical structure of the mature vine stem, and most current knowledge is based on first-year shoots. Moreover, the effect of drought stress on anatomical structure has been partly reported in shoots of Vitis vinifera but not in stems.\\n\\nIn current study two irrigation approaches were applied on Vitis vinifera Merlot vines: constant (low, medium and high irrigation) and dynamic (early/late season water deficit). The following parameters were measured: trunk diameter, annual ring width and area, vessel diameter, specific hydraulic conductivity and stem water potential.\\n\\nHigh water availability early in the season (high irrigation and late deficit) resulted in vigorous vegetative growth (greater trunk diameter, ring width and area), wider vessels and increased specific hydraulic conductivity. The distribution of large xylem vessels was altered by drought stress, where high water availability early in the season caused a shift of the vessel population towards the wider frequency classes. Interestingly, the early deficit vines showed more negative water potential values late in the season compared to the low irrigation vines. This may imply an effect of anatomical structure on vine water status.\\n\\nHighlightsWater availability early in the season determines vegetative growth and stem anatomical structure in mature Vitis vinifera vines.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions underlie almost all cellular functions. The comprehensive mapping of these complex cellular networks of stable and transient associations has been made available by affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and more recently by proximity based labelling methods such as BioID. Due the advancements in both methods and MS instrumentation, an in-depth analysis of the whole human proteome is at grasps. In order to facilitate this, we designed and optimized an integrated approach utilizing MAC-tag combining both AP-MS and BioID in a single construct. We systematically applied this approach to 18 subcellular localization markers and generated a molecular context database, which can be used to define molecular locations for any protein of interest. In addition, we show that by combining the AP-MS and BioID results we can also obtain interaction distances within a complex. Taken together, our combined strategy offers comprehensive approach for mapping physical and functional protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the dynamic gene regulatory mechanisms driving cells to make fate decisions remains elusive. We present a novel unsupervised machine learning methodology that can be used to analyze a dataset of heterogeneous single-cell gene expressions profiles, determine the most probable number of states (major cellular phenotypes) represented and extract the corresponding cell sub-populations. Most importantly, for any transition of interest from a source to a destination state, our methodology can zoom in, identify the cells most specific for studying the dynamics of this transition, order them along a trajectory of biological progression in posterior probabilities space, determine the \\\"key-player\\\" genes governing the transition dynamics, partition the trajectory into consecutive phases (transition \\\"micro-states\\\"), and finally reconstruct causal gene regulatory networks for each phase. Application of the end-to-end methodology provides new insights on key-player genes and their dynamic interactions during the important HSC-to-LMPP cell state transition involved in hematopoiesis. Moreover, it allows us to reconstruct a probabilistic representation of the \\\"epigenetic landscape\\\" of transitions and identify correctly the major ones in the hematopoiesis hierarchy of states.",

    "abstract": "Capture of each and every chromosome by spindle microtubules is essential to prevent chromosome loss and aneuploidy. In somatic cells, astral microtubules search and capture chromosomes forming lateral attachments to kinetochores. However, this mechanism alone is insufficient in large oocytes. We have previously shown that a contractile F-actin network is additionally required to collect chromosomes scattered in the 70-m starfish oocyte nucleus. How this F-actin-driven mechanism is coordinated with microtubule capture remained unknown. Here, we show that after nuclear envelope breakdown Arp2/3-nucleated F-actin patches form around chromosomes in a Ran-GTP-dependent manner, and we propose that these structures sterically block kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Once F-actin-driven chromosome transport is complete, coordinated disassembly of these F-actin patches allows synchronous capture by microtubules. Our observations indicate that this coordination is necessary, as early capture of chromosomes by microtubules would interfere with F-actin-driven transport leading to chromosome loss and formation of aneuploid eggs.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is controlled by networks of transcription factors and regulators, but the structure of these networks is as yet poorly understood and is thus inferred from data. Recent work has shown the efficacy of information theoretical approaches for network reconstruction from single cell transcriptomic data. Such methods use information to estimate dependence between every pair of genes in the dataset, then edges are inferred between top-scoring pairs. Dependence, however, does not indicate significance, and the definition of \\\"top-scoring\\\" is often arbitrary and a priori related to expected network size. This makes comparing networks across datasets difficult, because networks of a similar size are not necessarily similarly accurate. We present a method for performing formal hypothesis tests on putative network edges derived from information theory, bringing together empirical Bayes and work on theoretical null distributions for information measures. Thresholding based on empirical Bayes allows us to control network accuracy according to how we intend to use the network. Using single cell data from mouse pluripotent stem cells, we recover known interactions and suggest several new interactions for experimental validation (using a stringent threshold) and discover high-level interactions between sub-networks (using a more relaxed threshold). Furthermore, our method allows for the inclusion of prior information. We use in-silico data to show that even relatively poor quality prior information can increase the accuracy of a network, and demonstrate that the accuracy of networks inferred from single cell data can sometimes be improved by priors from population-level ChIP-Seq and qPCR data.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEfficient gene delivery into hard-to-transfect cells is still a challenge despite significant progress in the development of various gene delivery tools. Non-viral and synthetic polymeric nanoparticles offer an array of advantages for gene delivery over the viral vectors and high in demand as they are safe to use, easy to synthesize and highly cell-type specific. Here we demonstrate the use of a high-throughput screening (HTS) platform to screen for biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) that can transfect human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells with high efficiency and low toxicity. These NPs can deliver plasmid DNA (pDNA) to RPE monolayers more efficiently compared to the commercially available transfection reagents without interfering the global gene expression profile of RPE cells. In this work, we have established an HTS platform and identified synthetic polymers that can be used for high efficacy non-viral gene delivery to human RPE monolayers, enabling gene loss- and gain-of-function studies of cell signaling and developmental pathways. This platform can be used to identify the optimum polymer, weight-to-weight ratio of polymer to DNA, and the dose of NP for various retinal cell types.",

    "abstract": "We report the analysis of activation of full-length mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) from elephant shark, a cartilaginous fish belonging to the oldest group of jawed vertebrates by corticosteroids and progesterone. Based on their measured activities, aldosterone, cortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxcortisol, progesterone and 19-norprogesterone are potential physiological mineralocorticoids. However, aldosterone, the physiological mineralocorticoid in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates, is not found in cartilaginous or ray-finned fishes. Although progesterone activates ray-finned fish MRs, progesterone does not activate human, amphibian or alligator MRs, suggesting that during the transition to terrestrial vertebrates, progesterone lost the ability to activate the MR. Both elephant shark MR and human MR are expressed in the brain, heart, ovary, testis and other non-epithelial tissues, indicating that MR expression in diverse tissues evolved in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates. Our data suggest that progesterone-activated MR may have unappreciated functions in elephant shark ovary and testis.",

    "abstract": "Researchers, funders, and institutions are interested in understanding and quantifying research dissemination and impact, particularly related to communicating with the public. Traditionally, citations have been a primary impact measure; however, citations can be slow to accrue and focus on academic use. Recently altmetrics, which track alternate dissemination forms (e.g., social media) have been suggested as a complement to citation-based metrics. This study examines the relationship between altmetrics and traditional measures: journal article citations and access counts.\\n\\nThe researchers queried Web of Science and Altmetric Explorer for articles published in HPE journals between 2013-2015. They identified 2,486 articles with altmetrics. Data were analyzed using negative binomial and linear regression models.\\n\\nBlogging was associated with the greatest increase in citations (13% increase), whereas Tweets (1.2%) and Mendeley (1%) were associated with smaller increases. Journal impact factor (JIF) was associated with a 21% increase in citations. Publicly accessible articles were associated with a 19% decrease, but the interactive effect between accessible articles and JIF was associated with a 12% increase. When examining access counts, publicly accessible articles had an increase of 170 access counts whereas blogging was associated with a decrease of 87 accesses.\\n\\nThis study suggests that several altmetrics outlets are positively associated with citations, and that public accessibility, holding all other independent variables constant, is positively related to article access. Given the scientific communitys evolving focus on dissemination--including to the public--these findings have implications for stakeholders, providing insight into the factors that may improve citations and access of articles.",
