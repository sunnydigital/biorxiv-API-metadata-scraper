    "abstract": "The biogenic synthesis of metallic nanoparticles is of increasing interest. In this report, synthesis of gold nanoparticles by the model heavy metal-resistant strain Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 and Escherichia coli strain MG1655 was studied. For the synthesis of AuNPs, bacterial cells and secretomes were incubated with Au(III) ions, revealing that only CH34 cells can produce dispersions of AuNPs. Comparative bioinformatic analysis of proteomes from both strains showed potential CH34 proteins that may be electron donors during reduction of extracellular Au(III) ions and for the biosynthesis of gold nuggets in nature. Powder X-ray diffraction demonstrated that biogenic AuNPs are composed of face-centered cubic gold with a crystallinity biased towards {111} planes. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that AuNPs morphology was dominated by triangular and decahedral nanostructures. EDX and FT-IR spectra showed the presence of sulfur and vibrations associated to the biogenic AuNPs. Based on these results, and analyses of previous genomic and proteomic data, a mechanism for extracellular gold reduction and synthesis of AuNPs by strain CH34 is proposed. Average AuNPs diameter was obtained by nanoparticle tracking analysis, dynamic light scattering and analysis of electron microscopy images. DLS studies showed that biogenic AuNPs colloids are stable after exposure to ultrasound, high ionic strength and extreme pH conditions, and revealed the presence of basic groups associated to the AuNPs surface. Electrophoretic and dynamic light scattering indicated that biogenic dispersions of AuNPs are stabilized by a steric mechanism. The AuNPs produced by C. metallidurans CH34 are not cytotoxic towards bacterial cells, in contrast to biogenic AgNPs. These stable non-toxic biogenic AuNPs have potential clinical applications including development of topic delivery formulations and optical biosensors.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, genetic studies in cancer are focused on somatic mutations found in tumors and absent from the normal tissue. Identification of shared attributes in germline variation could aid discrimination of high-risk from likely benign mutations and narrow the search space for new cancer predisposing genes. Extraordinary progress made in analysis of common variation with GWAS methodology does not provide sufficient resolution to understand rare variation. To fulfil missing classification for rare germline variation we assembled datasets of whole exome sequences from >2,000 patients with different types of cancers: breast cancer, colon cancer and cutaneous and ocular melanomas matched to more than 7,000 non-cancer controls and analyzed germline variation in known cancer predisposing genes to identify common properties of disease associated mutations and new candidate cancer susceptibility genes. Lists of all cancer predisposing genes were divided into subclasses according to the mode of inheritance of the related cancer syndrome or contribution to known major cancer pathways. Out of all subclasses only genes linked to dominant syndromes presented significant rare germline variants enrichment in cases. Separate analysis of protein-truncating and missense variation in this subclass of genes confirmed significant prevalence of protein-truncating variants in cases only in loss-of-function tolerant genes (pLI<0.1), while ultra-rare missense mutations were significantly overrepresented in cases only in constrained genes (pLI>0.9). Taken together, our findings provide insights into the distribution and types of mutations underlying inherited cancer predisposition.",

    "abstract": "Behavior relies on the ability of sensory systems to infer properties of the environment from incoming stimuli. The accuracy of inference depends on the fidelity with which behaviorally-relevant properties of stimuli are encoded in neural responses. High-fidelity encodings can be metabolically costly, but low-fidelity encodings can cause errors in inference. Here, we discuss general principles that underlie the tradeoff between encoding cost and inference error. We then derive adaptive encoding schemes that dynamically navigate this tradeoff. These optimal encodings tend to increase the fidelity of the neural representation following a change in the stimulus distribution, and reduce fidelity for stimuli that originate from a known distribution. We predict dynamical signatures of such encoding schemes and demonstrate how known phenomena, such as burst coding and firing rate adaptation, can be understood as hallmarks of optimal coding for accurate inference.",

However, limited annotation of the islet epigenome has constrained efforts to define the molecular mechanisms mediating the, largely regulatory, signals revealed by Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). We characterised patterns of chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq, n=17) and DNA methylation (whole-genome bisulphite sequencing, n=10) in human islets, generating high-resolution chromatin state maps through integration with established ChIP-seq marks. We found enrichment of GWAS signals for T2D and fasting glucose was concentrated in subsets of islet enhancers characterised by open chromatin and hypomethylation, with the former annotation predominant. At several loci (including CDC123, ADCY5, KLHDC5) the combination of fine-mapping genetic data and chromatin state enrichment maps, supplemented by allelic imbalance in chromatin accessibility pinpointed likely causal variants. The combination of increasingly-precise genetic and islet epigenomic information accelerates definition of causal mechanisms implicated in T2D pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Ongoing developments in myoelectric prosthesis control have provided prosthesis users with an assortment of control strategies that vary in reliability and performance. Many studies have focused on improving performance by providing feedback to the user, but have overlooked the effect of this feedback on internal model development, which is key to improving long-term performance. In this work, the strength of internal models developed for two commonly used myoelectric control strategies: raw control with raw feedback (using a regression-based approach), and filtered control with filtered feedback (using a classifier-based approach), were evaluated using two psychometric measures: trial-by-trial adaptation and just-noticeable-difference. The performance of both strategies was also evaluated using a Schmidts style target acquisition task. Results obtained from 24 able-bodied subjects showed that although filtered control with filtered feedback had better short-term performance in path efficiency (p < 0.05), raw control with raw feedback resulted in stronger internal model development (p < 0.05), which may lead to better long-term performance. Despite inherent noise in the control signals of the regression controller, these findings suggest that rich feedback associated with regression control may be used to improve human understanding of the myoelectric control system.",

In this study we developed an efficient method to reconstruct AA structures from sampled CG protein-DNA complex models, which attempts to model protein-DNA interface accurately. First we developed a method to reconstruct atomic details of DNA structures from a 3-site per nucleotide CG model, which uses a DNA fragment library. Next, for the protein-DNA interface, we referred to the sidechain orientations in the known structure of the target interface when available. The other parts are modeled by existing tools. We confirmed the accuracy of the protocol in various aspects including the structure deviation in the self-reproduction, the base pair reproducibility, atomic contacts at the protein-DNA interface, and feasibility of the posterior AA simulations.",

    "abstract": "Health systems are stewards of patient electronic health record (EHR) data with extraordinarily rich depth and breadth, reflecting thousands of diagnoses and exposures. Measures of genomic variation integrated with EHRs offer a potential strategy to accurately stratify patients for risk profiling and discover new relationships between diagnoses and genomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) for common cancers are associated with multiple phenotypes in a Phenome-wide Association Study (PheWAS) conducted in 28,260 unrelated, genotyped patients of recent European ancestry who consented to participate in the Michigan Genomics Initiative, a longitudinal biorepository effort within Michigan Medicine. PRS for 12 cancer traits were calculated using summary statistics from the NHGRI-EBI catalog. A total of 1,711 synthetic case-control studies was used for PheWAS analyses. There were 13,490 (47.7%) patients with at least one cancer diagnosis in this study sample. PRSs exhibited strong association for several cancer traits they were designed for including female breast cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and thyroid cancer. Phenome-wide significant associations were observed between PRS and many non-cancer diagnoses. To differentiate PRS associations driven by the primary trait from associations arising through shared genetic risk profiles, the idea of \\\"exclusion PRS PheWAS\\\" was introduced. This approach led to phenome-wide significant associations between a lower risk for hypothyroidism in patients with high thyroid cancer PRS and a higher risk for actinic keratosis in patients with high squamous cell carcinoma PRS after removing all cases of the primary cancer trait. Further analysis of temporal order of the diagnoses improved our understanding of these secondary associations. This is the first comprehensive PheWAS study using PRS instead of a single variant.",

    "abstract": "In Gram-negative bacteria, porins span the outer membrane and control the influx of several prominent groups of antibiotics. Thus, it should not be surprising that expression of these porins is often altered in clinical isolates exhibiting multidrug resistance (MDR). The major regulator of porin expression in Escherichia coli is EnvZ, a canonical sensor histidine kinase (SHK). It allosterically processes periplasmic interactions with MzrA and cytoplasmic osmosensing into a single unified change in the ratio of its kinase and phosphatase activities. Unfortunately, the role of the EnvZ transmembrane domain (TMD) in bidirectional communication of these signals remains not well understood. Here, we employed in vivo sulfhydryl-reactivity to probe the dynamics of the TM2 helices and demonstrate that upon stimulus perception, only the region proximal to the periplasm undergoes conformational rearrangement. Furthermore, in silico coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations with aromatically tuned variants of EnvZ TM2 demonstrate the existence of both tilting and azimuthal rotational components to transmembrane communication while ruling out piston-type repositioning of TM2. Finally, in contrast to a similar analysis of TM1, we identified position-specific mutants possessing a \\\"flipped\\\" phenotype by dual-color fluorescent reporter analysis suggesting that both the periplasmic and cytoplasmic ends of TM2 are critical for maintenance of EnvZ signal output. Taken together, these data strongly support that EnvZ employs a non-piston-type mechanism during transmembrane communication. We conclude by discussing these results within the context of allosteric processing by EnvZ and propose that these results can be used to predict and classify transmembrane communication by various SHKs.\\n\\nImportanceThe EnvZ sensor histidine kinase serves as the major regulator of porin expression within Escherichia coli. A long-standing question is how stimulus perception by a bacterial receptor on one side of a biological membrane is transmitted to the opposite side of the membrane. To address this question, we monitored the dynamics of the transmembrane domain of EnvZ in vivo and coupled these results with in silico simulations of membrane-embedded EnvZ transmembrane domains. Taken together, these results demonstrate that detection of osmotic stress by the cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ results in non-piston communication across the inner membrane of E. coli. Thus, in addition to understanding how EnvZ regulates porin balance and antibiotic influx, these results contribute to answering the long-standing question of how transmembrane communication is performed by bacterial receptors. Our work concludes with a framework that correlates receptor domain composition and signal transduction mechanisms that could be employed by other research groups on their particular receptors of interest.",

    "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) consists of several regions that selectively interact to support distinct domains of cognition. Of the various sites that partake in DMN function, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), temporal parietal junction (TPJ), and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) are frequently identified as key contributors. Yet, it remains unclear whether these subcomponents of the DMN make unique contributions to specific cognitive processes and health conditions. To address this issue, we applied a meta-analytic parcellation approach used in prior work. This approach used the Neurosynth database and classification methods to quantify the association between PCC, TPJ, and MPFC activation and specific topics related to cognition and health (e.g., decision making and smoking). Our analyses replicated prior observations that the PCC, TPJ, and MPFC collectively support multiple cognitive functions such as decision making, memory, and awareness. To gain insight into the functional organization of each region, we parceled each region based on its coactivation pattern with the rest of the brain. This analysis indicated that each region could be further subdivided into functionally distinct subcomponents. Taken together, we further delineate DMN function by demonstrating the relative strengths of association among subcomponents across a range of cognitive processes and health conditions. A continued attentiveness to the specialization within the DMN allows future work to consider the nuances in sub-regional contributions necessary for healthy cognition, as well as create the potential for more targeted treatment protocols in various health conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAssessment of sleep/wake by electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) is invasive, resource intensive, and not amenable to rapid screening at scale for drug discovery. In the preclinical development of therapeutics for narcolepsy, efficacy tests are hindered by the lack of a non-EEG/EMG based translational test of symptom severity. The current methods study offers proof-of-principle that PiezoSleep (noninvasive, unsupervised piezoelectric monitoring of gross body movement, together with respiration patterns during behavioral quiescence), can be used to determine sleep/wake as applicable to the development of wake-promoting therapeutics. First, the translational wake-maintenance score (WMS, the ratio of time during the first half of the dark period spent in long wake bouts to short sleep bouts) of the PiezoSleep narcolepsy screen was introduced as a means by which to rank narcoleptic orexin/ataxin-3 mice and wild type mice by sleep/wake fragmentation severity. Accuracy of the WMS to detect narcoleptic phenotypes were determined in genotype-confirmed orexin/ataxin-3 mice and wild type colony mates. The WMS was used to identify the most highly symptomatic mice for resource-intensive EEG/EMG studies for further analysis of specific arousal states. Second, PiezoSleep was demonstrated for use in high-throughput screening of wake-promoting compounds using modafinil in orexin/ataxin-3 and wild type mice.\\n\\nResultsThe WMS detected a narcoleptic phenotype with 89% sensitivity, 92% specificity and 98% positive predictive value. A 15-fold difference in WMS differentiated wild type littermates from the most severely affected orexin/ataxin-3 mice. Follow-up EEG/EMG study indicated 82% of the orexin/ataxin-3 mice with the lowest wake-maintenance scores met or exceeded the cataplexy-occurrence threshold ([&ge;] 3 bouts) for inclusion in therapeutic efficacy studies. In the PiezoSleep dose-response study, the ED50 for wake-promotion by modafinil was approximately 50 mg/kg in both genotypes. Using unsupervised piezoelectric monitoring, the efficacy of wake-promoting compounds can be determined in a 5-arm study with 60 mice in less than one week--a fraction of the time compared to EEG/EMG studies.\\n\\nConclusionsThe WMS on the PiezoSleep narcolepsy screen quantifies the inability to sustain wakefulness and provides an accurate measure of the narcoleptic phenotype in mice.

    "abstract": "During pregnancy, the placenta protects the fetus against the maternal immune response, as well as bacterial and viral pathogens. Bacterial pathogens that have evolved specific mechanisms of breaching this barrier, such as Listeria monocytogenes, present a unique opportunity for learning how the placenta carries out its protective function. We previously identified the L. monocytogenes protein Internalin P (InlP) as a secreted virulence factor critical for placental infection (1). Here, we show that InlP, but not the highly similar L. monocytogenes internalin Lmo2027, binds to human afadin (encoded by AF-6), a protein associated with cell-cell junctions. A crystal structure of InlP reveals several unique features, including an extended leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain with a distinctive Ca2+-binding site. Despite afadins involvement in the formation of cell-cell junctions, MDCK epithelial cells expressing InlP displayed a decrease in the magnitude of the traction stresses they could exert on deformable substrates, similar to the decrease in traction exhibited by AF-6 knock-out MDCK cells. L. monocytogenes {Delta}inlP mutants were deficient in their ability to form actin-rich protrusions from the basal face of polarized epithelial monolayers, a necessary step in the crossing of such monolayers (transcytosis). A similar phenotype was observed for bacteria expressing an internal in-frame deletion in inlP (inlP DLRR5) that specifically disrupts its interaction with afadin. However, afadin deletion in the host cells did not rescue the transcytosis defect. We conclude that secreted InlP targets cytosolic afadin to specifically promote L. monocytogenes transcytosis across the basal face of epithelial monolayers, which may contribute to the crossing of the basement membrane during placental infection.",

    "abstract": "Changes in developmental gene regulatory networks enable evolved changes in morphology. These changes can be in cis regulatory elements that act in an allele-specific manner, or changes to the overall trans regulatory environment that interacts with cis regulatory sequences. Here we address several questions about the evolution of gene expression accompanying a convergently evolved constructive morphological trait, increases in tooth number in two independently derived freshwater populations of threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Are convergently evolved cis and/or trans changes in gene expression associated with convergently evolved morphological evolution? Do cis or trans regulatory changes contribute more to the evolutionary gain of a morphological trait? Transcriptome data from dental tissue of ancestral low-toothed and two independently derived high-toothed stickleback populations revealed significantly shared gene expression changes that have convergently evolved in the two high-toothed populations. Comparing cis and trans regulatory changes using phased gene expression data from F1 hybrids, we found that trans regulatory changes were predominant and more likely to be shared among both high-toothed populations. In contrast, while cis regulatory changes have evolved in both high-toothed populations, overall these changes were distinct and not shared among high-toothed populations. Together these data suggest that a convergently evolved trait can occur through genetically distinct regulatory changes that converge on similar trans regulatory environments.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryConvergent evolution, where a similar trait evolves in different lineages, provides an opportunity to study the repeatability of evolution. Convergent morphological evolution has been well studied at multiple evolutionary time scales ranging from ancient, to recent, such as the gain in tooth number in freshwater stickleback fish. However, much less is known about the accompanying evolved changes in gene regulation during convergent evolution. Here we compared evolved changes in gene expression in dental tissue of ancestral low-toothed marine fish to fish from two independently derived high-toothed freshwater populations. We also partitioned gene expression changes into those affecting a genes regulatory elements (cis), and those affecting the overall regulatory environment (trans). Both freshwater populations have evolved similar gene expression changes, including a gain of expression of putative dental genes. These similar gene expression changes are due mainly to shared changes to the trans regulatory environment, while the cis changes are largely population specific. Thus, during convergent evolution, overall similar and perhaps predictable transcriptome changes can evolve despite largely different underlying genetic bases.",

    "abstract": "Axon regeneration in the central nervous system is prevented in part by a developmental decline in the intrinsic regenerative ability of maturing neurons. This loss of axon growth ability likely reflects widespread changes in gene expression, but the mechanisms that drive this shift remain unclear. Chromatin accessibility has emerged as a key regulatory mechanism in other cellular contexts, raising the possibility that chromatin structure may contribute to the age-dependent loss of regenerative potential. Here we establish an integrated bioinformatic pipeline that combines analysis of developmentally dynamic gene networks with transcription factor regulation and genome-wide maps of chromatin accessibility. When applied to the developing cortex, this pipeline detected overall closure of chromatin in sub-networks of genes associated with axon growth. We next analyzed mature CNS neurons that were supplied with various pro-regenerative transcription factors. Unlike prior results with SOX11 and KLF7, here we found that neither JUN nor an activated form of STAT3 promoted substantial corticospinal tract regeneration. Correspondingly, chromatin accessibility in JUN or STAT3 target genes was substantially lower than in predicted targets of SOX11 and KLF7. Finally, we used the pipeline to predict pioneer factors that could potentially relieve chromatin constraints at growth-associated loci. Overall this integrated analysis substantiates the hypothesis that dynamic chromatin accessibility contributes to the developmental decline in axon growth ability and influences the efficacy of pro-regenerative interventions in the adult, while also pointing toward selected pioneer factors as high-priority candidates for future combinatorial experiments.",

    "abstract": "Corners rule predicts a positive correlation between leaf dimensions and the cross-sectional area of the primary stem. Although this relationship is usually explained by hydraulic and mechanical requirements, these hypotheses have never been tested empirically. However, Corners rule is tricky to investigate since rapid secondary growth of the stem prevents a rigorous link being established between a given leaf and the supporting stem. We chose a twig-like leaf model since petiole anatomy is only linked to the attached lamina. We tested the hypothesis that anatomical adjustments to hydraulic requirements related to vessel size enable reduced investment in tissue in the framework of Corners rule. We conducted a functional, mechanistic and intraspecific investigation of Cecropia obtusa Trecul, a Neotropical pioneer tree, by integrating morphological, anatomical and theoretical hydraulic traits around the lamina-petiole size relationship. The twig-like structure of the leaf and the strong lamina-petiole correlation of this model tree species made it possible to use the leaf-level model for a rigorous investigation of the functional implications of Corners rule. We found a positive correlation between petiole size, lamina size, the ratio of mean vessel area to vessel frequency in the petiole xylem and theoretical specific conductivity in the petiole xylem. Hydraulic function supports Corners rule to a lesser extent than previously thought. Variations in vessel dimensions mainly drive xylem hydraulic performances and avoid disproportionate petiole cross-sections to answer to hydraulic requirements associated with lamina size.",

    "abstract": "The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv7.1 (KCNQ1) co-assembles with KCNE1 to generate the cardiac potassium current IKs. Gain- and loss-of-function mutations in KCNQ1 are associated with atrial fibrillation and long-QT (LQT) syndrome, respectively, highlighting the importance of modulating IKS activity for proper cardiac function. On a post-translational level, IKS can be regulated by phosphorylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation. Here, we report proteolysis of Kv7.1 as a novel, irreversible posttranslational modification. The identification of two C-terminal fragments (CTF1 and CTF2) of Kv7.1 led us to identify an aspartate critical for the generation of CTF2 and caspases as responsible for mediating Kv7.1 proteolysis. Activating caspases by apoptotic stimuli significantly reduced Kv7.1/KCNE1 currents, which was abrogated in cells expressing caspase-resistant Kv7.1 D459A/KCNE1 channels. An increase in cleavage of Kv7.1 could be detected in the case of LQT mutation G460S, which is located adjacent to the cleavage site. Application of apoptotic stimuli or doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity provoked caspase-mediated cleavage of endogenous Kv7.1 in human cardiomyocytes. In summary, our findings establish caspases as novel regulatory components for modulating Kv7.1 activity which may have important implications for the molecular mechanism of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.\\n\\nNon-standard Abbreviations and Acronyms",

    "abstract": "Methods that estimate heritability and genetic correlations from genome-wide association studies have proven to be powerful tools for investigating the genetic architecture of common diseases and exposing unexpected relationships between disorders. Many relevant studies employ a case-control design, yet most methods are primarily geared towards analyzing quantitative traits. Here we investigate the validity of three common methods for estimating genetic heritability and genetic correlation. We find that the Phenotype-Correlation-Genotype-Correlation (PCGC) approach is the only method that can estimate both quantities accurately in the presence of important non-genetic risk factors, such as age and sex. We extend PCGC to work with summary statistics that take the case-control sampling into account, and demonstrate that our new method, PCGC-s, accurately estimates both heritability and genetic correlations and can be applied to large data sets without requiring individual-level genotypic or phenotypic information. Finally, we use PCGC-S to estimate the genetic correlation between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and demonstrate that previous estimates are biased due to incorrect handling of sex as a strong risk factor. PCGC-s is available at https://github.com/omerwe/PCGCs.",

    "abstract": "Ordination is a common tool in ecology that aims at representing complex biological information in a reduced space. In landscape genetics, ordination methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) have been used to detect adaptive variation based on genomic data. Taking advantage of environmental data in addition to genotype data, redundancy analysis (RDA) is another ordination approach that is useful to detect adaptive variation. This paper aims at proposing a test statistic based on RDA to search for loci under selection. We compare redundancy analysis to pcadapt, which is a nonconstrained ordination method, and to a latent factor mixed model (LFMM), which is a univariate genotype-environment association method. Individual-based simulations identify evolutionary scenarios where RDA genome scans have a greater statistical power than genome scans based on PCA. By constraining the analysis with environmental variables, RDA performs better than PCA in identifying adaptive variation when selection gradients are weakly correlated with population structure. Additionally, we show that if RDA and LFMM have a similar power to identify genetic markers associated with environmental variables, the RDA-based procedure has the advantage to identify the main selective gradients as a combination of environmental variables. To give a concrete illustration of RDA in population genomics, we apply this method to the detection of outliers and selective gradients on an SNP data set of Populus trichocarpa (Geraldes et al., 2013). The RDA-based approach identifies the main selective gradient contrasting southern and coastal populations to northern and continental populations in the northwestern American coast.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial respiratory complex II utilizes succinate, key substrate of the Krebs cycle, for oxidative phosphorylation, which is essential for glucose metabolism. Mutations of complex II cause cancers and mitochondrial diseases, raising a critical question of the (patho-)physiological functions. To address the fundamental role of complex II in systemic energy metabolism, we specifically knockout SDHB in mice liver, a key complex II subunit that tethers the catalytic SDHA subunit and transfers the electrons to ubiquinone, and found that SHDB deficiency abolishes the assembly of complex II without affecting other respiration complexes while largely retaining SDHA stability. SHDB ablation reprograms energy metabolism and hyperactivates the glycolysis, Krebs cycle and {beta}-oxidation pathways, leading to catastrophic energy deficit and early death. Strikingly, sucrose supplementation or high fat diet resumes both glucose and lipid metabolism and prevent early death. Also, SDHB deficient mice are completely resistant to high fat diet induced obesity. Our findings reveal that the unanticipated role of complex II orchestrating both lipid and glucose metabolisms, and suggest that SDHB is an ideal therapeutic target for combating obesity.",

Using two-photon calcium imaging in identified cell types in awake mice, we show that auditory cortex (AC) neurons projecting to primary visual cortex (V1) preferentially encode the abrupt onsets of sounds. In V1, a sub-population of layer 1 interneurons gates this selective cross-modal information by a suppression specific to the absence of visual inputs. However, when large auditory onsets coincide with visual stimuli, visual responses are strongly boosted in V1. Thus, a dynamic asymmetric circuit across AC and V1 specifically identifies visual events starting simultaneously to sudden sounds, potentially catalyzing localization of new sound sources in the visual field.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic Connectivity Networks, patterns of correlated activity emerging from \\\"resting-state\\\" Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent time series, are increasingly being associated to cognitive, clinical, and behavioral aspects, and compared with the pattern of activity elicited by specific tasks. We study the reconfiguration of the brain networks between task and resting-state conditions by a machine learning approach, to highlight the Intrinsic Connectivity Networks (ICNs) which are more affected by the change of network configurations in task vs. rest. We use a large cohort of publicly available data in both resting and task-based fMRI paradigms; by trying a battery of different supervised classifiers relying only on task-based measurements, we show that the highest accuracy is reached with a simple neural network of one hidden layer. In addition, when testing the fitted model on resting state measurements, such architecture yields a performance close to 90% for areas connected to the task performed, which mainly involve the visual and sensorimotor cortex, whilst a relevant decrease of the performance is observed in the other ICNs. On one hand, our results confirm the correspondence of ICNs in both paradigms (task and resting) thus opening a window for future clinical applications to subjects whose participation in a required task cannot be guaranteed. On the other hand it is shown that brain areas not involved in the task display different connectivity patterns in the two paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Chemical pollutant exposure is a risk factor contributing to the growing epidemic of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affecting human populations that consume a Western diet. Although it is recognized that intoxication by chemical pollutants can lead to NAFLD, there is limited information available regarding the mechanism by which typical environmental levels of exposure can contribute to the onset of this disease. Here we describe the alterations in gene expression profiles and metabolite levels in the human hepatocyte HepaRG cell line, a validated model for cellular steatosis, exposed to the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 126, one of the most potent chemical pollutants that can induce NAFLD. Sparse partial least squares classification of the molecular profiles revealed that exposure to PCB 126 provoked a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as an increase in sphingolipid levels, concomitant with a decrease in the activity of genes involved in lipid metabolism. This was associated with an increased oxidative stress reflected by marked disturbances in taurine metabolism. A gene ontology analysis showed hallmarks of an activation of the AhR receptor by dioxin-like compounds. These changes in metabolome and transcriptome profiles were observed even at the lowest concentration (100 pM) of PCB 126 tested. A decrease in docosatrienoate levels was the most sensitive biomarker. Overall, our integrated multi-omics analysis provides mechanistic insight into how this class of chemical pollutant can cause NAFLD. Our study lays the foundation for the development of molecular signatures of toxic effects of chemicals causing fatty liver diseases to move away from a chemical risk assessment based on in vivo animal experiments.",

Curtailing the metabolism to render product formation an essential carbon drain was identified as one major strategy generating strong coupling of metabolic activity and target synthesis. Impeding the balancing of cofactors and protons in the absence of target production was the underlying principle of all other strategies and further increased the GC strength of the aforementioned strategies.
