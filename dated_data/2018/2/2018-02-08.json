    "abstract": "Harmful mutations are ubiquitous and inevitable, and the rate at which these mutations are removed from populations is a critical determinant of evolutionary fate. Closely related sexual and asexual taxa provide a particularly powerful setting to study deleterious mutation elimination because sexual reproduction should facilitate mutational clearance by reducing selective interference between sites and by allowing the production of offspring with different mutational complements than their parents. Here, we compared the rate of removal of conservative (i.e., similar biochemical properties) and radical (i.e., distinct biochemical properties) nonsynonymous mutations from mitochondrial genomes of sexual vs. asexual Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a New Zealand freshwater snail characterized by coexisting and ecologically similar sexual and asexual lineages. Our analyses revealed that radical nonsynonymous mutations are cleared at higher rates than conservative changes and that sexual lineages eliminate radical changes more rapidly than asexual counterparts. These results are consistent with reduced efficacy of purifying selection in asexual lineages allowing harmful mutations to remain polymorphic longer than in sexual lineages. Together, these data illuminate some of the population-level processes contributing to mitochondrial mutation accumulation and suggest that mutation accumulation could influence the outcome of competition between sexual and asexual lineages.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundComplex traits can share a substantial proportion of their polygenic heritability. However, genome-wide polygenic correlations between pairs of traits can mask heterogeneity in their shared polygenic effects across loci. We propose a novel method (WML-RPC) to evaluate polygenic correlation between two complex traits in small genomic regions using summary association statistics. Our method tests for evidence that the polygenic effect at a given region affects two traits concurrently.\\n\\nResultsWe show through simulations that our method is well calibrated, powerful and more robust to misspecification of linkage disequilibrium than other methods under a polygenic model. As small genomic regions are more likely to harbour specific genetic effects, our method is ideal to identify heterogeneity in shared polygenic correlation across regions. We illustrate the usefulness of our method by addressing two questions related to cardio-metabolic traits. First, we explored how regional polygenic correlation can inform on the strong epidemiological association between HDL cholesterol and coronary artery disease (CAD), suggesting a key role for triglycerides metabolism. Second, we investigated the potential role of PPAR{gamma} activators in the prevention of CAD.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results provide a compelling argument that shared heritability between complex traits is highly heterogeneous across loci.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) has become a major fMRI method to study network organization of human brains. There has been recent interest in the temporal fluctuations of FC calculated using short time windows (\\\"dynamic FC\\\") because this method could provide information inaccessible with conventional \\\"static\\\" FC, which is typically calculated using the entire scan lasting several tens of minutes. Although multiple studies have revealed considerable temporal fluctuations in FC, it is still unclear whether the fluctuations of FC measured in hemodynamics reflect the dynamics of underlying neural activity. We addressed this question using simultaneous imaging of neuronal calcium and hemodynamic signals in mice and found coordinated temporal dynamics of calcium FC and hemodynamic FC measured in the same short time windows. Moreover, we found that variation in transient neuronal coactivation patterns (CAPs) was significantly related to temporal fluctuations of sliding window FC in hemodynamics. Finally, we show that the observed dynamics of FC cannot be fully accounted for by simulated data assuming stationary FC. These results provide evidence for the neuronal origin of dynamic FC and further suggest that information relevant to FC is condensed in temporally sparse events that can be extracted using a small number of time points.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveOsteoarthritis (OA) impacts humans and several other animals. Thus, the mechanisms underlying this disorder, such as specific skeletal tissue DNA methylation patterns, may be evolutionary conserved. However, associations between methylation and OA have not been readily studied in nonhuman animals. Baboons serve as important models of disease and develop OA at rates similar to those in humans. Therefore, this study investigated the associations between methylation and OA in baboons to advance the evolutionary understanding of OA.\\n\\nDesignTrabecular bone and cartilage was collected from the medial condyles of adult female baboon femora, five with and five without knee OA. The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K array) was used to identify DNA methylation patterns in these tissues.\\n\\nResultsApproximately 44% of the 450K array probes reliably align to the baboon genome, contain a CpG site of interest, and maintain a wide distribution throughout the genome. Of the two filtering methods tested, both identified significantly differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between healthy and OA individuals in cartilage tissues, and some of these patterns overlap with those previously identified in humans. Conversely, no DMPs were found between tissue types or between disease states in bone tissues.\\n\\nConclusionsOverall, the 450K array can be used to measure genome-wide DNA methylation in baboon tissues and identify significant associations with complex traits. The results of this study indicate that some DNA methylation patterns associated with OA are evolutionarily conserved, while others are not. This warrants further investigation in a larger and more phylogenetically diverse sample set.",

    "abstract": "A distinctive feature of the Gram-negative bacterial cell envelope is the asymmetric outer membrane (OM), where lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and phospholipids (PLs) reside in the outer and inner leaflets, respectively. This unique lipid asymmetry renders the OM impermeable to external insults. In Escherichia coli, the OmpC-MlaA complex is believed to maintain lipid asymmetry by removing mislocalized PLs from the outer leaflet of the OM. How it performs this function is unknown. Here, we define the molecular architecture of the OmpC-MlaA complex to gain insights into its role in PL transport. We establish that MlaA sits entirely within the bilayer in complex with OmpC and provides a hydrophilic channel possibly for PL translocation across the OM. Furthermore, we show that flexibility in a hairpin loop adjacent to the channel modulates MlaA activity. Finally, we demonstrate that OmpC plays an active role in maintaining OM lipid asymmetry together with MlaA. Our work offers glimpses into how the OmpC-MlaA complex transports PLs across the OM and has important implications for future antimicrobial drug development.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100046). The recent Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa witnessed considerable efforts to obtain viral genomic data as the epidemic was unfolding. If such data can be deployed in real-time, molecular epidemiological investigations could play a role in complementing contact tracing undertaken by public health agencies. Analysing the EBOV genomes accumulated to date can also deliver insights into epidemic dynamics. Such analyses have been shown that metapopulation dynamics were critical for EBOV dispersal between rural and urban areas during the epidemic, but the implications for specific intervention scenarios remain unclear. Here, we address this issue using a collection of phylodynamic approaches. We show that long-distance dispersal events (between administrative areas >250 km apart) were not crucial for epidemic expansion and that preventing viral lineage movement to any given administrative area would, in most cases, have had little impact. However, urban areas - specifically those encompassing the three capital cities and their suburbs - were critical in attracting and further disseminating the virus: preventing viral lineage movement to all three simultaneously would have contained epidemic size by two-thirds. Using continuous phylogeographic reconstructions we estimate a distance kernel for EBOV spread and reveal considerable heterogeneity in dispersal velocity through time. We also show that announcements of border closures were followed by a significant but transient effect on international virus dispersal. By quantifying the hypothetical impact of different intervention strategies as well as the impact of barriers on dispersal frequency, our study illustrates how phylodynamic analyses can help to address specific epidemiological and outbreak control questions.",

In this case control study, we performed genome-wide association and pathways based analysis in a sample of 71 Dutch women who attended an STI clinic who were seropositive for Chlamydia trachomatis antibodies and 169 high risk Dutch women who sought similar health services but who were seronegative. We identified two regions of within-gene SNP association with Chlamydia trachomatis serological response and found that GPCR signalling and cell cycle pathways were also associated with the trait. These pathway level associations appear to be common to immunological sequelae of Chlamydial infections in both ocular and urogenital tropisms.

    "abstract": "By killing cattle and otherwise complicating management, the many species of larkspur (Delphinium spp.) present a serious, intractable, and complex challenge to livestock grazing management in the western United States. Among the many obstacles to improving our understanding of cattle-larkspur dynamics has been the difficulty of testing different grazing management strategies in the field, as the risk of dead animals is too great. Agent-based models (ABMs) provide an effective method of testing alternate management strategies without risk to livestock. ABMs are especially useful for modeling complex systems such as livestock grazing management, and allow for realistic bottom-up encoding of cattle behavior. Here, we introduce a spatially-explicit, behavior-based ABM of cattle grazing in a pasture with a dangerous amount of Geyers larkspur (D. geyeri). This model tests the role of herd cohesion and stocking density in larkspur intake, finds that both are key drivers of larkspur-induced toxicosis, and indicates that alteration of these factors within realistic bounds can mitigate risk. Crucially, the model points to herd cohesion, which has received little attention in the discipline, as playing an important role in lethal acute toxicosis. As the first ABM to model grazing behavior at realistic scales, this study also demonstrates the tremendous potential of ABMs to illuminate grazing management dynamics, including fundamental aspects of livestock behavior amidst ecological heterogeneity.",

Corneal endothelial cells have a complex basal and paracellular shape making them challenging to accurately measure, particularly in oedematous ex vivo tissue. This study used calibrated centroidal Voronoi Diagrams to segment cells in images of these human corneas, in order to characterize endothelial geometry, topology, and phase.\\n\\nHexagonal cells dominated the endothelia, with most comprised of five different pleomorphs exhibiting self-similar topological coarsening through most of the endothelial cell density range. There was a linear relationship between cell size and shape, though cells with greater than six sides were present in larger proportions than cells with less. Hexagonal cell regularity was stable and largely independent of density.\\n\\nCell and tissue phase was also examined, using the cell shape index relative to the recently discovered  cell jamming phase transition boundary. Images showed fluid endothelia with a range of shape indices spanning the boundary, independent of density but dependent on hexagonal regularity. The cells showed a bimodal distribution centred at the boundary, with the largest proportion of cells on the fluid side. A shoulder at the boundary suggested phase switching via shape transformation across the energy barrier, with cells either side having distinctly different size and shape characteristics. Regular hexagonal cells were closest to the boundary.\\n\\nThis study showed the corneal endothelium acts as a glassy viscous foam characterized by well-established physical laws. Endothelial cell death transiently and locally increases cell fluidity, which is subsequently arrested by jamming of the pleomorphically diverse cell collective, via rearrangement and shape change of a small proportion of cells, which become locked in place by their neighbours and maintain endothelial function with little energy expenditure.",

    "abstract": "Action potentials (APs) are electric phenomena that are recorded both intracellularly and extracellularly. APs are usually initiated in the short segment of the axon called the axon initial segment (AIS). It was recently proposed that at onset of an AP the soma and the AIS form a dipole. We study the extracellular signature (the extracellular action potential, EAP) generated by such a dipole. First, we demonstrate the formation of the dipole and its extracellular signature in detailed morphological models of a reconstructed pyramidal neuron. Then, we study the EAP waveform and its spatial dependence in models with axonal AP initiation and contrast it with the EAP obtained in models with somatic AP initiation. We show that in the models with axonal AP initiation the dipole forms between somatodendritic compartments and the AIS, and not between soma and dendrites as in the classical models. Soma-dendrites dipole is present only in models with somatic AP initiation. Our study has consequences for interpreting extracellular recordings of single-neuron activity and determining electrophysiological neuron types, but also for better understanding the origins of the high-frequency macroscopic electric fields recorded in the brain.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyWe studied the consequences of the action potential (AP) initiation site on the extracellular signatures of APs. We show that: (1) at the time of AP initiation the action initial segment (AIS) forms a dipole with the soma, (2) the width but not (3) amplitude of the extracellular AP generated by this dipole increases with the soma-AIS distance.

    "abstract": "The 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) increasingly has been implicated in normal brain physiology, as well as in neuropsychiatric disorders. The a7-nAChR primarily is located in cerebral cortex and sub-cortical regions, compared to the 4{beta}2 nAChR subtype that has a more subcortical distribution. The highly cortical distribution suggests a role of a7-nAChR in cognition. We expanded the first-in-human PET imaging of 7-nAChR with [18F]ASEM from five to 21 healthy non-smoking volunteers and added preliminary evidence of binding in six male patients with schizophrenia. Study aims included 1) confirmation of test-retest reproducibility of [18F]ASEM binding in normal volunteers, 2) demonstration of specificity of [18F]ASEM binding by competition with DMXB-A, an 7-nAChR partial agonist previously tested in clinical trials of patients with schizophrenia, 3) estimation of [18F]ASEM binding potentials and 7-nAChR density in vivo in humans, and 4) 7-nAChR binding in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy volunteers.\\n\\nTest-retest PET confirmed reproducibility (>90%) (variability [&le;] 7%) of [18F]ASEM volume of distribution (VO_SCPLOWTC_SCPLOW) estimates in healthy volunteers. Repeated sessions of PET in five healthy subjects included baseline and effect of inhibition after oral administration of 150 mg DMXB-A. From reduction of binding potentials, we estimated the dose-dependent occupancy of 7-nAChR by DMXB-A at 17-49% for plasma concentrations at 60-200 nM DMXB-A. In agreement with evidence post-mortem, 7-nAChR density (Bmax) averaged 0.67-0.82 nM and inhibitor affinity constant (KO_SCPLOWIC_SCPLOW) averaged 170-385 nM. Median VO_SCPLOWTC_SCPLOW in a feasibility study of six patients with schizophrenia was lower than in healthy volunteers in cingulate cortex, frontal cortex, and hippocampus. Mann-Whitney test identified cingulate cortex and hippocampus as regions with significantly lower median VO_SCPLOWTC_SCPLOW in patients than in healthy volunteers when a single outlier patient was excluded from analysis (P = 0.02, corrected for multiple comparisons).",

    "abstract": "The risk of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) comprises both genetic and environmental components. We investigated whether genetic susceptibility to T1D could be mediated by changes in DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism that potentially plays a role in autoimmune diabetes. Using data from a non-diabetic population comprising blood samples taken at birth (n=844), childhood (n=911) and adolescence (n=907), we evaluated the associations between 65 top GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genome-wide DNA methylation levels. We identified 159 proximal SNP-cytosine phosphate guanine (CpG) pairs (cis), and 7 distal SNP-CpG associations (trans) at birth, childhood, and adolescence. There was also a systematic enrichment for methylation related SNPs to be associated with T1D across the genome, after controlling for genomic characteristics of the SNPs, implying that methylation could either be on the causal pathway to T1D or a non-causal biomarker. Combining the principles of Mendelian Randomization and genetic colocalization analysis, we provided evidence that at 5 loci, ITGB3BP, AFF3, PTPN2, CTSH and CTLA4, DNA methylation is potentially on the causal pathway to T1D.",

Some of these elements integrate in the chromosome, whereas others replicate autonomously as plasmids. Recent works showed the existence of few differences, and occasional interconversion, between the two types of elements. Here, we enquired on why evolutionary processes have maintained the two types of mobile genetic elements by comparing integrative and conjugative elements (ICE) with extrachromosomal ones (conjugative plasmids) of the highly abundant MPFT conjugative type. We observed that plasmids encode more replicases, partition systems, and antibiotic resistance genes, whereas ICEs encode more integrases and metabolism-associated genes. ICEs and plasmids have similar average sizes, but plasmids are much more variable, have more DNA repeats, and exchange genes more frequently. On the other hand, we found that ICEs are more frequently transferred between distant taxa. We propose a model where differential plasticity and transmissibility range explain the co-occurrence of integrative and extra-chromosomal elements in microbial populations. In particular, the conversion from ICE to plasmid allows ICE to be more plastic, while the conversion from plasmid to ICE allows the expansion of the element s host range.",

    "abstract": "Establishing a connection between intrinsic and task-evoked brain activity is critical because it would provide a way to map task-related brain regions in patients unable to comply with such tasks. A crucial question within this realm is to what extent the execution of a cognitive task affects the intrinsic activity of brain regions not involved in the task. Computational models can be useful to answer this question because they allow us to distinguish task from non-task neural elements while giving us the effects of task execution on non-task regions of interest at the neuroimaging level. The quantification of those effects in a computational model would represent a step towards elucidating the intrinsic versus task-evoked connection. Here we used computational modeling and graph theoretical metrics to quantify changes in intrinsic functional brain connectivity due to task execution. We used our Large-Scale Neural Modeling framework to embed a computational model of visual short-term memory into an empirically derived connectome. We simulated a neuroimaging study consisting of ten subjects performing passive fixation (PF), passive viewing (PV) and delay match-to-sample (DMS) tasks. We used the simulated BOLD fMRI time-series to calculate functional connectivity (FC) matrices and used those matrices to compute several graph theoretical measures. After determining that the simulated graph theoretical measures were largely consistent with experiments, we were able to quantify the differences between the graph metrics of the PF condition and those of the PV and DMS conditions. Thus, we show that we can use graph theoretical methods applied to simulated brain networks to aid in the quantification of changes in intrinsic brain functional connectivity during task execution. Our results represent a step towards establishing a connection between intrinsic and task-related brain activity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryStudies of resting-state conditions are popular in neuroimaging. Participants in resting-state studies are instructed to fixate on a neutral image or to close their eyes. This type of study has advantages over traditional task-based studies, including its ability to allow participation of those with difficulties performing tasks. Further, a resting-state neuroimaging study reveals intrinsic activity of participants brains. However, task-related brain activity may change this intrinsic activity, much as a stone thrown in a lake causes ripples on the waters surface. Can we measure those activity changes? To answer that question, we merged a computational model of visual short-term memory (task regions) with an anatomical model incorporating major connections between brain regions (non-task regions). In a computational model, unlike real data, we know how different regions are connected and which regions are doing the task. First, we simulated neuronal and neuroimaging activity of both task and non-task regions during three conditions: passive fixation (baseline), passive viewing, and visual short-term memory. Then, applying graph theory to the simulated neuroimaging of non-task regions, we computed differences between the baseline and the other conditions. Our results show that we can measure changes in non-task regions due to brain activity changes in task-related regions.",

    "abstract": "Temporally ordered multi-neuron patterns likely encode information in the brain. We introduce an unsupervised method, SPOTDisClust (Spike Pattern Optimal Transport Dissimilarity Clustering), for their detection from high-dimensional neural ensembles. SPOTDisClust measures similarity between two ensemble spike patterns by determining the minimum transport cost of transforming their corresponding normalized cross-correlation matrices into each other (SPOTDis). Then, it performs density-based clustering based on the resulting inter-pattern dissimilarity matrix. SPOTDisClust does not require binning and can detect complex patterns (beyond sequential activation) even when high levels of out-of-pattern \\\"noise\\\" spiking are present. Our method handles efficiently the additional information from increasingly large neuronal ensembles and can detect a number of patterns that far exceeds the number of recorded neurons. In an application to neural ensemble data from macaque monkey V1 cortex, SPOTDisClust can identify different moving stimulus directions on the sole basis of temporal spiking patterns.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe brain encodes information by ensembles of neurons, and recent technological developments allow researchers to simultaneously record from over thousands of neurons. Neurons exhibit spontaneous activity patterns, which are constrained by experience and development, limiting the portion of state space that is effectively visited. Patterns of spontaneous activity may contribute to shaping the synaptic connectivity matrix and contribute to memory consolidation, and synaptic plasticity formation depends crucially on the temporal spiking order among neurons. Hence, the unsupervised detection of spike sequences is a sine qua non for understanding how spontaneous activity contributes to memory formation. Yet, sequence detection presents major methodological challenges like the sparsity and stochasticity of neuronal output, and its high dimensionality. We propose a dissimilarity measure between neuronal patterns based on optimal transport theory, determining their similarity from the pairwise cross-correlation matrix, which can be taken as a proxy of the \\\"trace\\\" that is left on the synaptic matrix. We then perform unsupervised clustering and visualization of patterns using density clustering on the dissimilarity matrix and low-dimensional embedding techniques. This method does not require binning of spike times, is robust to noise, jitter and rate fluctuations, and can detect more patterns than the number of neurons.",

    "abstract": "A better understanding of the genomic changes that facilitate the emergence and spread of drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains is required. Short-read sequencing methods have limited capacity to identify long, repetitive genomic regions and gene duplications. We sequenced an extensively drug resistant (XDR) Beijing sub-lineage 2.2.1.1 \\\"epidemic strain\\\" from the Western Province of Papua New Guinea using long-read sequencing (Oxford Nanopore MinION(R)). With up to 274 fold coverage from a single flow-cell, we assembled a 4404947bp circular genome containing 3670 coding sequences that include the highly repetitive PE/PPE genes. Comparison with Illumina reads indicated a base-level accuracy of 99.95%. Mutations known to confer drug resistance to first and second line drugs were identified and concurred with phenotypic resistance assays. We identified mutations in efflux pump genes (Rv0194), transporters (secA1, glnQ, uspA), cell wall biosynthesis genes (pdk, mmpL, fadD) and virulence genes (mce-gene family, mycp1) that may contribute to the drug resistance phenotype and successful transmission of this strain. Using the newly assembled genome as reference to map raw Illumina reads from representative M. tuberculosis lineages, we detect large insertions relative to the reference genome.

With some of the genomic markers responsible for its drug resistance and transmissibility are known, there is need to elucidate all molecular mechanisms that account for the resistance phenotype, virulence and transmission. Whole genome sequencing using short reads has widely been utilized to study MTB genome but it does not generally capture long repetitive regions as variants in these regions are eliminated using analysis. Illumina instruments are known to have a GC bias so that regions with high GC or AT rich are under sampled and this effect is exacerbated in MTB, which has approximately 65% GC content. In this study, we utilized Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION sequencing to assemble a high-quality complete genome of an extensively drug resistant strain of a modern Beijing lineage. We were able to able to assemble all PE/PPE (proline-glutamate/proline-proline-glutamate) gene families that have high GC content and repetitive in nature. We show the genomic utility of ONT in offering a more comprehensive understanding of genetic mechanisms that contribute to resistance, virulence and transmission.

    "abstract": "The human whipworm Trichuris trichiura is a parasite that infects around 500 million people globally, with consequences including damage to physical growth and educational performance. Current drugs such as mebendazole have a notable lack of efficacy against whipworm, compared to other soil-transmitted helminths. Mass drug administration programs are therefore unlikely to achieve eradication and new treatments for trichuriasis are desperately needed. All current drug control strategies focus on post-infection eradication, targeting the parasite in vivo. Here we propose developing novel anthelmintics which target the egg stage of the parasite in the soil as an adjunct environmental strategy. As evidence in support of such an approach we describe the actions of a new class of anthelmintic compounds, the 2,4-diaminothieno[3,2-d]pyrimidines (DATPs). This compound class has found broad utility in medicinal chemistry, but has not previously been described as having anthelmintic activity. Importantly, these compounds show efficacy against not only the adult parasite, but also both the embryonated and unembryonated egg stages and thereby may enable a break in the parasite lifecycle.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe human whipworm, Trichuris trichiura, infects around 500 million people globally, impacting on their physical growth and educational performance. There are currently huge mass drug administration (MDA) programs aiming to control whipworm, along with the other major soil transmitted helminths, Ascaris and hookworm. However single doses of albendazole and mebendazole, which are used in MDA, have particularly poor effectiveness against whipworm, with cure rates less than 40%. This means that MDA may not be able to control and eliminate whipworm infection, and risks the spread of resistance to albendazole and mebendazole in the parasite population.\\n\\nWe are attempting to develop new treatments for parasitic worm infection, particularly focused on whipworm. We report the identification of a class of compounds, diaminothienopyrimidines (DATPs), which have not previously been described as anthelmintics. These compounds are effective against adult stages of whipworm, and also block the development of the model nematode C. elegans.\\n\\nOur DATP compounds reduce the ability of treated eggs to successfully establish infection in a mouse model of human whipworm. These results support a potential environmental spray to control whipworm by targeting the infectious egg stage in environmental hotspots.",

    "abstract": "We use optical tweezers microrheology and fluorescence microscopy to characterize the nonlinear mesoscale mechanics and mobility of in vitro co-entangled actin-microtubule composites. We create a suite of randomly-oriented, well-mixed networks of actin and microtubules by co-polymerizing varying ratios of actin and tubulin in situ. To perturb each composite far from equilibrium, we use optical tweezers to displace an embedded microsphere a distance greater than the lengths of the filaments at a speed much faster than their intrinsic relaxation rates. We simultaneously measure the resistive force the filaments exert and the subsequent force relaxation. We find that the presence of a large fraction of microtubules (>0.7) is needed to substantially increase the resistive force, which is accompanied by large heterogeneities in force response. Actin minimizes these heterogeneities by reducing the mesh size of the composites and supporting microtubules against buckling. Composites also undergo a sharp transition from stress-softening to stiffening when the fraction of microtubules ({phi}T) exceeds 0.5, by microtubules suppressing actin bending fluctuations. The induced force following strain relaxes via two time-dependent power-law decays. The first decay phase, with scaling exponents that increase proportionally with the fraction of actin, signifies actin bending fluctuations. Alternatively, the second phase, with a{phi} T-independent scaling exponent of ~0.4, is indicative of filaments reptating out of deformed entanglement constraints. Corresponding mobility measurements of steady-state actin and microtubules show that both filaments are more mobile in equimolar composites ({phi}T=0.5) compared to networks of primarily actin or microtubules. This non-monotonic dependence of mobility on{phi} T, which further demonstrates the important role mesh size plays in composites, highlights the surprising emergent properties that can arise in composites.",

While the region around the mating type locus is characterized by a higher frequency of SNPs compared to other genomic regions, we find that the population is remarkably clonal, with highly conserved gene content, low levels of variation, and little evidence of recombination These results support a model of recent transition to asexual growth when this species specialized to growth on human hosts.\\n\\nData access: Genome sequence data is available in NCBI under the Umbrella BioProject PRJNA186851.",

    "abstract": "Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are highly expressed during the cell-intrinsic immune response to viral infection. IFIT1 inhibits translation by binding directly to the 5' end of foreign RNAs, particularly those with non-self cap structures, precluding the recruitment of the cap-binding eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F and subsequent 40S recruitment. Interaction of different IFIT family members is well described, but little is known of the molecular basis of IFIT association or its impact on function. Here, we reconstituted different complexes of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 in vitro, which enabled us to reveal critical aspects of IFIT complex assembly. IFIT1 interacts rapidly and strongly with IFIT3 forming a stable heterotetramer. IFIT2 and IFIT3 homodimers dissociate to form a more stable heterodimer that associates with IFIT1, forming an IFIT1:IFIT2:IFIT3 trimer. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed a C-terminal  YxxxL motif in IFIT1 that mediates its association with IFIT3. Using various reporter mRNAs, we demonstrate for the first time that IFIT3 stabilises IFIT1 binding to cap0-mRNA and enhances its translation inhibition activity. Disrupting the binding interface between IFIT1 and IFIT3 abrogated this enhancement.

    "abstract": "The G2/M checkpoint is activated on DNA damage by the ATM and ATR kinases that are regulated by post-translational modifications. In this paper, the transcriptional co-regulation of ATM and ATR by SMARCAL1 and BRG1, both members of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein family, is described. SMARCAL1 and BRG1 co-localize on the promoters of ATM and ATR; downregulation of SMARCAL1/BRG1 results in transcriptional repression of ATM/ATR and therefore, overriding of the G2/M checkpoint leading to mitotic abnormalities. On doxorubicin-induced DNA damage, SMARCAL1 and BRG1 are upregulated and in turn, upregulate the expression of ATM/ATR.\\n\\nPhosphorylation of ATM/ATR is needed for the transcriptional upregulation of SMARCAL1 and BRG1, and therefore, of ATM and ATR on DNA damage. The regulation of ATM/ATR is rendered non-functional if SMARCAL1 and/or BRG1 are absent or if the two proteins are mutated such that they are unable to hydrolyze ATP, as in for example in Schimke Immuno-Osseous Dysplasia and Coffin-Siris Syndrome. Thus, an intricate transcriptional regulation of DNA damage response genes mediated by SMARCAL1 and BRG1 is present in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveReanimation of muscles paralyzed by disease states such as spinal cord injury remains a much sought after therapeutic goal of neuroprosthetic research. Optogenetic stimulation of peripheral motor nerves expressing light-sensitive opsins is a promising approach to muscle reanimation that may overcome several drawbacks of traditional methods such as functional electrical stimulation (FES). However, the utility of these methods has only been demonstrated in rodents to date, while translation to clinical practice will likely first require demonstration and refinement of these gene therapy techniques in non-human primates.\\n\\nApproachThree rhesus macaques were injected intramuscularly with either one or both of two optogenetic constructs (AAV6-hSyn-ChR2-eYFP and/or AAV6-hSyn-Chronos-eYFP) to transduce opsin expression in the corresponding nerves. Neuromuscular junctions were targeted for virus delivery using an electrical stimulating injection technique. Functional opsin expression was periodically evaluated up to 13 weeks post-injection by optically stimulating targeted nerves with a 472 nm fiber-coupled laser while recording electromyographic (EMG) responses.\\n\\nMain ResultsOne monkey demonstrated functional expression of ChR2 at 8 weeks post-injection in each of two injected muscles, while the second monkey briefly exhibited contractions coupled to optical stimulation in a muscle injected with the Chronos construct at 10 weeks. A third monkey injected only in one muscle with the ChR2 construct showed strong optically coupled contractions at 5 [1/2] weeks which then disappeared by 9 weeks. EMG responses to optical stimulation of ChR2-transduced nerves demonstrated graded recruitment relative to both stimulus pulse-width and light intensity, and were able to track stimulus trains up to 16 Hz. In addition, the EMG response to prolonged stimulation showed delayed fatigue over several minutes.\\n\\nSignificanceThese results demonstrate the feasibility of viral transduction of peripheral motor nerves for functional optical stimulation of motor activity in non-human primates, a variable timeline of opsin expression in a primate model closer to humans, and fundamental EMG response characteristics to optical nerve stimulation. Subsequently, they represent an important step in translating these optogenetic techniques as a clinically viable gene therapy.",

    "abstract": "Cartilage-derived matrix (CDM) has emerged as a promising scaffold material for tissue engineering of cartilage and bone due to its native chondroinductive capacity and its ability to support endochondral ossification. Because it consists of native tissue, CDM can undergo cellular remodeling, which can promote integration with host tissue and enables it to be degraded and replaced by neotissue over time. However, enzymatic degradation of decellularized tissues can occur unpredictably and may not allow sufficient time for mechanically competent tissue to form, especially in the harsh inflammatory environment of a diseased joint. The goal of the current study was to engineer cartilage and bone constructs with the ability to inhibit aberrant inflammatory processes caused by the cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1), through scaffold-mediated delivery of lentiviral particles containing a doxycycline-inducible IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) transgene on anatomically-shaped CDM constructs. Additionally, scaffold-mediated lentiviral gene delivery was used to facilitate spatial organization of simultaneous chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation via site-specific transduction of a single mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) population to overexpress either chondrogenic, transforming growth factor-beta 3 (TGF-{beta}3), or osteogenic, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), transgenes. Controlled induction of IL-1Ra expression protected CDM hemispheres from inflammation-mediated degradation, and supported robust bone and cartilage tissue formation even in the presence of IL-1. In the absence of inflammatory stimuli, controlled cellular remodeling was exploited as a mechanism for fusing concentric CDM hemispheres overexpressing BMP-2 and TGF-{beta}3 into a single bi-layered osteochondral construct. Our findings demonstrate that site-specific delivery of inducible and tunable transgenes confers spatial and temporal control over both CDM scaffold remodeling and neotissue composition. Furthermore, these constructs provide a microphysiological, in vitro, joint, organoid model with site-specific, tunable, and inducible protein delivery systems for examining the spatiotemporal response to pro-anabolic and/or inflammatory signaling across the osteochondral interface.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomic sequencing of patient samples is a very promising method for the diagnosis of human infections. Sequencing has the ability to capture all the DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a human sample. However, complete and accurate characterization of the sequence, including identification of any pathogens, depends on the availability and quality of genomes for comparison. Thousands of genomes are now available, and as these numbers grow, the power of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosis should increase. However, recent studies have exposed the presence of contamination in published genomes, which when used for diagnosis increases the risk of falsely identifying the wrong pathogen.\\n\\nTo address this problem, we have developed a bioinformatics system for eliminating contamination as well as low-complexity genomic sequences in the draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. We applied this software to identify and remove human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences present in a comprehensive database of all sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes. We also removed low-complexity genomic sequences, another source of false positives. Using this pipeline, we have produced a database of \\\"clean\\\" eukaryotic pathogen genomes for use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools. We demonstrate that when attempting to find eukaryotic pathogens in metagenomic samples, the new database provides better sensitivity than one using the original genomes while offering a dramatic reduction in false positives.",

    "abstract": "In long-term grassland biodiversity experiments positive effects of biodiversity on plant productivity commonly increase with time. It has been shown that such increased biodiversity effects persist even if plants are transferred into a common environment. Thus, we hypothesized that community diversity had acted as a selective agent, which resulted in the emergence of plant monoculture and mixture types. To test our hypothesis, we grew offspring from plants that were exposed for eleven years to a monoculture or mixture environment in a biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment) under controlled greenhouse conditions in monocultures or two-species mixtures. We used epiGBS, a genotyping-by-sequencing approach combined with bisulfite conversion to provide integrative genetic and epigenetic data. We observed significant genetic and epigenetic divergence according to selection history in three out of five perennial grassland species, namely Galium mollugo, Prunella vulgaris and Veronica chamaedrys. For a fourth species, Lathyrus pratensis, we found mixed evidence and a fifth one, Plantago lanceolata, did not exhibit any divergence. In addition, current diversity levels in the greenhouse also had weak effects on epigenetic variation. Our results suggest that selection of genetic variants, and possibly epigenetic variants, caused the rapid emergence of monoculture and mixture types within plant species in the Jena Experiment. However, given the limited genome coverage, it remains unclear how much of the epigenetic divergence was independent of the genetic divergence.",

    "abstract": "Understanding factors that increase ecosystem stability is critical in the face of environmental change. Experiments simulating species loss from grassland ecosystems have shown that losing biodiversity decreases the ability of ecosystems to buffer negative effects of disturbances. However, as the originally sown experimental communities with reduced biodiversity develop, plant evolutionary processes or the assembly of interacting soil organisms may allow them to develop stability and resilience over time. We explored such effects in a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment with plant communities with either a history of co-occurrence (selected communities) or no such history (naive communities) over a four-year period in which a major flood disturbance occurred.\n\nWe found selected communities had temporally more stable biomass than the same communities of naive plants, especially at low species richness. Furthermore, selected communities showed greater short-term biomass recovery after flooding, resulting in more stable post-flood productivity. In contrast to a previous study, the positive diversity-stability relationship was maintained after the flooding. Our results were consistent across three soil treatments simulating the presence or absence of co-selected microbial communities. We suggest that prolonged exposure of plant populations to a particular community context and abiotic site conditions can increase ecosystem temporal stability and resistance to disturbance. We argue that selection during the course of a biodiversity experiment is the most parsimonious explanation for these effects. A history of co-occurrence can in part compensate for species loss, as can high plant diversity in part compensate for the missing opportunity of such adaptive adjustments.",

    "abstract": "Advances in genome sequencing and genomics research are bringing us closer to a new era of personalized medicine, where healthcare can be tailored to the individuals genetic makeup, and to more effective diagnosis and treatment of rare genetic diseases. Much of this progress depends on collaborations and access to genomes, thus, a number of initiatives have been introduced to support seamless data sharing. Among these, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health runs a popular platform, called Matchmaker Exchange, that allows researchers to perform queries for rare genetic disease discovery over multiple federated databases. Queries include gene variations which are linked to rare diseases, and the ability to find other researchers that have seen or have interest in those variations is extremely valuable. Nonetheless, in some cases, researchers may be reluctant to use the platform since the queries they make (thus, what they are working on) are revealed to other researchers, and this creates concerns with privacy and competitive advantage.\\n\\nIn this paper, we present AnoniMME, a novel framework geared to enable anonymous queries within the Matchmaker Exchange platform. We build on Reverse Private Information Retrieval (PIR) to let researchers anonymously query the federated platform, in a multi-server setting, by writing their query, along with a public encryption key, anonymously in a public database. AnoniMME also supports responses, allowing other researchers to respond to queries by providing their encrypted contact details.",

ORFeome collections, whereby almost all ORFs of a given species are cloned and can be subsequently leveraged in multiple functional genomic approaches, represent valuable resources towards this endeavor.

We have generated an ORFeome collection composed of 5,102 ORFs cloned in a Gateway donor vector, representing 83% of the currently annotated coding sequences of C. albicans. Sequencing data of the cloned ORFs are available in the CandidaOrfDB database at http://candidaorfeome.eu. We also engineered 49 expression vectors with a choice of promoters, tags, and selection markers and demonstrated their applicability to the study of target ORFs transferred from the C. albicans ORFeome. In addition, the use of the ORFeome in the detection of protein-protein interaction was demonstrated. Mating-compatible strains as well as Gateway-compatible two-hybrid vectors were engineered, validated and used in a proof of concept experiment. These unique and valuable resources should greatly facilitate future functional studies in C. albicans and the elucidation of mechanisms that underlie its pathogenicity.",

Unfortunately, designs that rely on integrating multiple variable sequences, such as combinatorial perturbations or perturbations linked to barcodes, may be compromised by unintended consequences of lentiviral packaging. Intermolecular recombination between library elements and integration of multiple perturbations (even at limiting virus dilution) can negatively impact the sensitivity of pooled screens. Here, we describe a simple approach to prevent recombination between lentiviral vectors containing multiple linked variable elements, such as the recently reported CRISP-seq, Perturb-seq, and Mosaic-seq designs. We show that modifying the packaging protocol by diluting the perturbation library with a carrier plasmid increases the fraction of correct, single integrations from <60% to >90%, at the cost of reducing titer by 100-fold.",

Here we present a complementary whole genome annotation approach, ConsHMM, which applies a multivariate hidden Markov model to learn de novo different  conservation states based on the combinatorial and spatial patterns of which species align to and match a reference genome in a multiple species DNA sequence alignment. We applied ConsHMM to a 100-way vertebrate sequence alignment to annotate the human genome at single nucleotide resolution into 100 different conservation states. These states have distinct enrichments for other genomic information including gene annotations, chromatin states, and repeat families, which were used to characterize their biological significance. Conservation states have greater or complementary predictive information than standard constraint based measures for a variety of genome annotations. Bases in constrained elements have distinct heritability enrichments depending on the conservation state assignment, demonstrating their relevance to analyzing phenotypic associated variation. The conservation states also highlight differences in the conservation patterns of bases prioritized by a number of scores used for variant prioritization. The ConsHMM method and conservation state annotations provide a valuable resource for interpreting genomes and genetic variation.",

    "abstract": "Microbial mutualistic cross-feeding interactions are ubiquitous and can drive important community functions. Engaging in cross-feeding undoubtedly affects the physiology and metabolism of individual species involved. However, the nature in which an individuals physiology is influenced by cross-feeding and the importance of those physiological changes for the mutualism have received little attention. We previously developed a genetically tractable coculture to study bacterial mutualisms. The coculture consists of fermentative Escherichia coli and phototrophic Rhodopseudomonas palustris. In this coculture, E. coli anaerobically ferments sugars into excreted organic acids as a carbon source for R. palustris. In return, a genetically-engineered R. palustris constitutively converts N2 into NH4+, providing E. coli with essential nitrogen. Using RNA-seq and proteomics, we identified transcript and protein levels that differ in each partner when grown in coculture versus monoculture. When in coculture with R. palustris, E. coli gene-expression changes resembled a nitrogen starvation response under the control of the transcriptional regulator NtrC. By genetically disrupting E. coli NtrC, we determined that a nitrogen starvation response is important for a stable coexistence, especially at low R. palustris NH4+ excretion levels. Destabilization of the nitrogen starvation regulatory network resulted in variable growth trends and in some cases, extinction. Our results highlight that alternative physiological states can be important for survival within cooperative cross-feeding relationships.\\n\\nImportanceMutualistic cross-feeding between microbes within multispecies communities is widespread. Studying how mutualistic interactions influence the physiology of each species involved is important for understanding how mutualisms function and persist in both natural and applied settings. Using a bacterial mutualism consisting of Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Escherichia coli growing cooperatively through bidirectional nutrient exchange, we determined that an E. coli nitrogen starvation response is important for maintaining a stable coexistence. The lack of an E. coli nitrogen starvation response ultimately destabilized the mutualism and, in some cases, led to community collapse after serial transfers. Our findings thus inform on the potential necessity of an alternative physiological state for mutualistic coexistence with another species compared to the physiology of species grown in isolation.",

Since 2005, the incidence of human clinical cases (frequently severe), with this genotype has increased. We aimed to understand this change, by studying the recent evolutionary history of RT078. Phylogenetic analysis of international genomes (isolates from 2006-2014) revealed several recent clonal expansions. A common ancestor of each expansion had independently acquired different alleles of the tetracycline resistance gene tetM. Consequently, an unusually high proportion of RT078 genomes were tetM positive (76.5%). Additional tetracycline resistance determinants were also identified, some for the first time in C. difficile (efflux pump tet40). Each tetM-clonal expansion lacked geographic structure, indicating rapid international spread. Resistance determinants for C. difficile-infection-triggering antimicrobials including fluoroquinolones and clindamycin were comparatively rare in RT078. Tetracyclines are used intensively in agriculture; this selective pressure, plus rapid spread via the food-chain may explain the increased RT078 prevalence in humans.",

    "abstract": "Environmental enrichment (EE) is widely used to study the effects of external factors on brain development, function and health in rodent models, but very little is known of the effects of EE on the brain in a large animal model such as the pig. Twenty-four young pigs (aged 5 weeks at start of study, 1:1 male: female ratio) were housed in environmentally enriched (EE) pens and provided with additional enrichment stimulation (a bag filled with straw) once daily. Litter, weight and sex matched controls n= (24) were housed in barren (B) conditions. Behaviour was recorded on alternate days from study day 10. After 21 days, RNA-sequencing of the frontal cortex of male piglets culled one hour after the enrichment stimulation, but not those at 4 hours after stimulation, showed upregulation of genes involved in neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity in the EE compared to the B condition. This result is mirrored in the behavioural response to the stimulation which showed a peak in activity around the 1 hour time-point. By contrast, EE piglets displayed a signature consistent with a relative decrease in microglial activity compared to those in the B condition. These results confirm those from rodents, suggesting that EE may also confer neuronal health benefits in large mammal models, through a potential relative reduction in neuroinflammatory process and increase in neuroprotection driven by an enrichment-induced increase in behavioural activity.",

When latency and silent periods were taken into account, contralateral orientations 0{degrees}, 45{degrees}, 90{degrees}, and 315{degrees} were found to best elicit OO MEPs with a likely cortical origin. As expected, the largest FDI MEPs were recorded with an orientation of 45{degrees}, invoking a posterior-anterior (PA) current flow, from the contralateral location.\\n\\nConclusionOrientations traditionally used for FDI were also found suitable for eliciting OO MEPs. Individuals vary more in their optimal coil orientation for eliciting MEPs from OO than for FDI. It is recommended that researchers iteratively probe several orientations when eliciting MEPs from OO.

Emerging evidence indicates that primary visual cortex (i.e., V1) may contribute to recognition memory, but this has been tested only with a single visuospatial sequence as the target memorandum. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate whether human V1 can support the learning of multiple, concurrent, and complex visual sequences involving discontinous (second-order) associations. Two peripheral, goal-irrelevant but structured sequences of orientated gratings appeared simultaneously in fixed locations of the right and left visual fields alongside a central, goal-relevant sequence that was in the focus of spatial attention. Pseudorandom sequences were introduced at multiple intervals during the presentation of the three structured visual sequences to provide an online measure of sequence-specific knowledge at each retinotopic location. We found that a network involving the precuneus and V1 was involved in learning the structured sequence presented at central fixation, whereas right V1 was modulated by repeated exposure to the concurrent structured sequence presented in the left visual field. The same result was not found in left V1. These results indicate for the first time that human V1 can support the learning of multiple concurrent sequences involving complex discontinuous inter-item associations, even peripheral sequences that are goal-irrelevant.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB)-mediated gene expression is critical for the processing of visceral information, including learning about visceral stimuli (e.g. conditioned taste aversion). However, CREB requires additional co-factors to induce gene expression, including transducer of regulated CREB-activity (TORC). The nuclear localization of TORC1 has not been examined previously in the visceral neuraxis. c-Fos, a widely-used marker of activity, is induced by visceral stimulation. If CREB-mediated gene transcription is necessary for c-Fos induction in the visceral neuraxis after systemic LiCl injection, then TORC should be active following stimulation, and co-localized with c-Fos in activated neurons. We examined nuclear (activated) TORC1 in the visceral neuraxis at 30, 60, and 180 minutes after LiCl, as compared to c-Fos induction. Consistent with previous studies we found increases in c-Fos 60 min after LiCl in all regions. Nuclear TORC1 was also increased in the area postrema, NTS, and paraventricular nucleus after LiCl. Surprisingly, in the central amygdala, TORC1 was deactivated after LiCl, such that almost all TORC1 was cytoplasmic, whereas control rats had almost all nuclear TORC1. Fluorescent double-labeling of TORC1 and c-Fos after LiCl found that cellular co-localization of c-Fos and TORC1 was very low across the visceral neuraxis. Nuclear TORC1 expression reveals a population of cells in the visceral neuraxis, independent of c-Fos-positive cells, that are regulated by LiCl. TORC1, and in turn CREB-mediated gene transcription, may not be necessary for c-Fos induction in the visceral neuraxis after LiCl.",

We conducted a hydroponic experiment and measured root morphology, organic anions exudation, and analysed changes in the transcriptome and metabolome, to understand oat root adaptation to P deficiency. We found that oat roots showed enhanced citrate and malate exudation after four weeks of P-deficiency.

Regulons, serve as co-regulated gene groups contribute to the transcriptional regulation of microbe genome, have the potential in understanding the underlying regulatory mechanism. Lactococcus lactis is one of the most important Gram-positive lactic acid-producing bacteria, widely used in food industry and has been proved to have advantages in oral delivery of drug and vaccine. In this study, we designed a novel computational pipeline, RECTA, for regulon prediction. The pipeline carried out differentially expressed gene prediction, gene co-expression analysis, cis-regulatory motif finding, and comparative genomic study to predict and validate regulons related to acid stress response in Lactococcus lactis MG1363. A total of 51 regulons were identified, and 14 of them have computational verified significance. Among these 14 regulons, five of them were computationally predicted to be connected with acid stress response with (i) known transcriptional factors in MEME suite database successfully mapped in Lactococcus lactis MG1363; and (ii) differentially expressed genes between pH values of 6.5 (control) and 5.1 (treatment). Validated by 36 literature confirmed acid stress response related proteins and genes, 33 genes in Lactococcus lactis MG1363 were found having orthologous genes using BLAST, associated to six regulons. An acid response related regulatory network was constructed, involving two trans-membrane proteins, eight regulons (llrA, llrC, hllA, ccpA, NHP6A, rcfB, regulons #8 and #39), nine functional modules, and 33 genes with orthologous genes known to be associated to acid stress. Our RECTA pipeline provides an effective way to construct a reliable gene regulatory network based on regulon elucidation. The predicted resistance pathways could serve as promising candidates for better acid tolerance engineering in Lactococcus lactis. It has a strong application power and can be effectively applied to other bacterial genomes, where the elucidation of the transcriptional regulation network is needed.",

    "abstract": "Advances in single-cell transcriptomics techniques are revolutionizing studies of cellular differentiation and heterogeneity. Consequently, it becomes possible to track the trajectory of thousands of genes across the cellular lineage trees that represent the temporal emergence of cell types during dynamic processes. However, reconstruction of cellular lineage trees with more than a few cell fates has proved challenging. We present MERLoT (https://github.com/soedinglab/merlot), a flexible and user-friendly tool to reconstruct complex lineage trees from single-cell transcriptomics data and further impute temporal gene expression profiles along the reconstructed tree structures. We demonstrate MERLoTs capabilities on various real cases and hundreds of simulated datasets.",

    "abstract": "The environmental health of aquatic ecosystems is critical to society, yet traditional assessments of water quality have limited utility for some bodies of water such as large rivers. Sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA) has the potential to complement if not replace traditional sampling of biotic assemblages for the purposes of reconstructing aquatic assemblages and, by proxy, assessing water quality. Despite this potential, there has been little testing of the ability of eDNA to reconstruct assemblages and their absolute and relative utility to infer water quality metrics. Here, we reconstruct phytoplankton communities by amplifying and sequencing DNA from a portion of the 23S rRNA region from filtered water samples along a 2900-km transect in the Mississippi River. Across the entire length, diatoms dominated the assemblage (72.6%) followed by cryptophytes (8.7%) and cyanobacteria (7.0%). There were no general trends in the abundances of these major taxa along the length of the river, but individual taxon abundance peaked in different regions. For example, the abundance of taxa genetically similar to Melosira tropica peaked at approximately 60% of all reads 2750 km upstream from the Gulf of Mexico, while taxa similar to Skeletonema marinoi began to increase below the confluence with the Missouri River until it reached approximately 30% of the reads at the Gulf of Mexico. There were four main clusters of samples based on phytoplankton abundance, two above the confluence with the Missouri and two below. Phytoplankton abundance was a poor predictor of NH4 + concentrations in the water, but predicted 61% and 80% of the variation in observed NO3 -and PO4 3-concentrations, respectively. Phytoplankton richness increased with increasing distance along the river, but was best explained by phosphate concentrations and water clarity. Along the Mississippi transect, there was similar structure to phytoplankton and bacterial assemblages, indicating that the two sets of organisms are responding to similar environmental factors. In all, the research here demonstrates the potential utility of metabarcoding for reconstructing aquatic assemblages, which might aid in conducting water quality assessments.",

Here we combine phylogenomic, epigenomic and developmental data to show that convergent evolution of regulatory regions, but not protein-coding genes, is associated with flightlessness in palaeognathous birds, a classic example of a convergent phenotype. Eleven new genomes, including a draft genome from an extinct moa, resolve palaeognath phylogeny and show that the incidence of independent, convergent accelerations among 284,000 conserved non-exonic elements is significantly more frequent in ratites than other bird lineages. Ratite-specific acceleration of conserved regions and measures of open chromatin across eight tissues in the developing chick identify candidate regulatory regions that may have modified or lost function in ratites. Enhancer activity assays conducted in the early developing chicken forelimb confirm that volant versions of a conserved element in the first intron of the TEAD1 gene display conserved enhancer activity, whereas an accelerated flightless version fails to drive reporter gene expression. Our results show that convergent molecular changes associated with loss of flight are largely regulatory in nature.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity and sleep disorders are established risk factors for many diseases, but their etiology is poorly understood, partly due to a reliance on self-reported evidence. Here we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of wearable-defined and machine-learned physical activity and sleep phenotypes in 91,112 UK Biobank participants, and self-reported physical activity in 351,154 UK Biobank participants. While the self-reported activity analysis resulted in no significant (p<5x10-9) loci, the analysis of objectively-measured traits identified 10 loci, 6 of which are novel. These 10 loci account for 0.05% of activity and 0.33% of sleep phenotype variation, but genome-wide estimates suggest that common variation accounts for ~12% of phenotypic variation, indicating high polygenicity. Heritability was higher in women than in men for overall activity ({Delta}h2 = 4%, p=6.3x10-5), moderate intensity activity (6%, p=6.7x10-8), and walking (5%, p=2.6x10-6). Heritability partitioning, enrichment and pathway analyses all indicate the central nervous system plays a role in activity behaviours. Mendelian randomization in publicly available GWAS data and in 278,367 UK Biobank participants, who were not included in our discovery analyses, suggest that overall activity might be causally related to lowering body fat percentage (beta per SD higher overall activity: -0.44, SE=0.047, p=2.70x10-21) and systolic blood pressure (beta per SD: -0.71, SE=0.125, p=1.38x10-8). Our current results advocate the value of physical activity for the reduction of adiposity and blood pressure.",

IL7R mRNA is induced in stimulated monocytes in a genetically determined manner, yet a role for IL7R in monocyte biology remains unexplored. Here we characterize genetic regulation of IL7R at the protein level across multiple cell subsets and conditions in healthy individuals. We find monocyte surface and soluble IL7R (sIL7R) protein are markedly expressed in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We further demonstrate alleles of rs6897932, a non-synonymous IL7R polymorphism associated with susceptibility to Multiple Sclerosis, Ankylosing Spondylitis and Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, form the key determinant of both surface IL7R and sIL7R in the context of inflammation. No effect of this allele was observed in unstimulated monocytes or across lymphoid subsets. Production of sIL7R by monocytes greatly exceeded that of CD4+ T-cells, and was strongly associated with both rs6897932 genotype and expression of the splicing factor gene DDX39A. Stimulated monocytes were sensitive to exogenous IL-7, which elicits a defined transcriptional signature. Flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing of synovial fluid derived monocytes from patients with spondyloarthritis showed an enlarged subset of IL7R+ monocytes with a unique transcriptional profile that markedly overlaps that induced by IL-7 in-vitro and shows similarity to the previously described  Mono4 subset. These data demonstrate disease-associated genetic variants at IL7R specifically impact monocyte surface IL7R and sIL7R following innate immune stimulation, suggesting a previously unappreciated key role for monocytes in IL-7 pathway biology and IL7R-associated diseases.",

    "abstract": "T7 development in Escherichia coli requires the inhibition of the housekeeping form of the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP), E{sigma}70, by two T7 proteins: Gp2 and Gp5.7. While the biological role of Gp2 is well understood, that of Gp5.7 remains to be fully deciphered. Here, we present results from functional and structural analyses to reveal that Gp5.7 primarily serves to inhibit E{sigma}S, the predominant form of the RNAP in the stationary phase of growth, which accumulates in exponentially growing E. coli as a consequence of buildup of guanosine pentaphosphate ((p)ppGpp) during T7 development. We further demonstrate a requirement of Gp5.7 for T7 development in E. coli cells in the stationary phase of growth. Our finding represents a paradigm for how some lytic phages have evolved distinct mechanisms to inhibit the bacterial transcription machinery to facilitate phage development in bacteria in the exponential and stationary phases of growth.\\n\\nSignificance statementVirus that infect bacteria (phages) represent the most abundant living entities on the planet and many aspects of our fundamental knowledge of phage-bacteria relationships have been derived in the context of exponentially growing bacteria. In the case of the prototypical Escherichia coli phage T7, specific inhibition of the housekeeping form of the RNA polymerase (E{sigma}70) by a T7 protein, called Gp2, is essential for the development of viral progeny. We now reveal that T7 uses a second specific inhibitor that selectively inhibits the stationary phase RNAP (E{sigma}S), which enables T7 to develop well in exponentially growing and stationary phase bacteria. The results have broad implications for our understanding of phage-bacteria relationships and therapeutic application of phages.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial infection in the gut is often due to successful invasion of the host microbiome by an introduced pathogen. Ecological theory indicates that resident community members and their interactions should be strong determinants of whether an invading taxon can persist in a community. In the context of the gut microbiome, this suggests colonization resistance against newly introduced bacteria should depend on the instantaneous bacterial community composition within the gut and interactions between these constituent members. Here we develop a mathematical model of how metabolite-dependent biotic interactions between resident bacteria mediate invasion, and find that stronger biotic connectivity from metabolite cross-feeding and competition increases colonization resistance. We then introduce a statistical method for identifying invasive taxa in the human gut, and show empirically that greater connectivity of the resident gut microbiome is related to increased resistance to invading bacteria. Finally, we examined patient outcomes after fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) for recurring Clostridium difficile infection. Patients with lower connectivity of the gut microbiome after treatment were more likely to relapse, experiencing a later infection. Thus, simulation models and data from human subjects support the hypothesis that stronger interactions between bacteria in the gut repel invaders. These results demonstrate how ecological invasion theory can be applied to the gut microbiome, which might inform targeted microbiome manipulations and interventions. More broadly, this study provides evidence that low connectivity in gut microbial communities is a hallmark of community instability and susceptibility to invasion.",

    "abstract": "More than 14,000 neonates are infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV) annually. Approximately half display manifestations limited to the skin, eyes, or mouth (SEM disease). The rest develop invasive infections that spread to the central nervous system (CNS disease or encephalitis) or systemically (disseminated disease). Invasive HSV disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but viral and host factors that predispose neonates to these forms are unknown. To define viral diversity within the infected neonatal population, we evaluated ten HSV-2 isolates from newborns with a range of clinical presentations. To assess viral fitness independent of host immune factors, we measured viral growth characteristics in cultured cells and found diverse in vitro phenotypes. Isolates from neonates with CNS disease were associated with larger plaque size and enhanced spread, with isolates from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exhibiting the most robust growth. We sequenced complete viral genomes of all ten neonatal viruses, providing new insights into HSV-2 genomic diversity in this clinical setting. We found extensive inter-host and intra-host genomic diversity throughout the viral genome, including amino acid differences in more than 90% of the viral proteome. The genes encoding glycoprotein G (gG, US4), gI (US7), gK (UL53), and viral proteins UL8, UL20, UL24, and US2 contained variants that were found in association with CNS isolates. Many of these viral proteins are known to contribute to cell spread and neurovirulence in mouse models of CNS disease. This study represents the first application of comparative pathogen genomics to neonatal HSV disease.\n\nImportanceHerpes simplex virus (HSV) causes invasive disease in half of infected neonates, resulting in significant mortality and permanent cognitive morbidity. The factors that contribute to invasive disease are not understood. This study reveals diversity among HSV isolates from infected neonates, and makes the first associations between viral genetic variations and clinical disease manifestations. We found that viruses isolated from newborns with encephalitis show enhanced spread in culture. These viruses contain protein-coding variations not found in viruses causing non-invasive disease. Many of these variations are found in proteins known to impact neurovirulence and viral spread between cells. This work advances our understanding of HSV diversity in the neonatal population and how it may impact disease outcome.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial focused ultrasound is a form of non-invasive neuromodulation that uses acoustic energy to affect neuronal excitability. The effect of ultrasound on human motor cortical excitability is currently unknown. We apply ultrasound to the primary motor cortex in humans using a novel transcranial ultrasound and magnetic stimulation (TUMS) paradigm that allows for concurrent and concentric ultrasound stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This allows for non-invasive inspection of the effect of ultrasound on motor neuronal excitability using the motor evoked potential (MEP) generated by TMS. We test the effect of ultrasound on single pulse MEP recruitment curves and paired pulse protocols including short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). We also test the longevity of the effect and the effect of ultrasound on the cortical silent period in a small sub-sample of participants. In addition, we test the effect of ultrasound to motor cortex on a stimulus response reaction time task. Results show ultrasound inhibits the amplitude of single-pulse MEPs and attenuates intracortical facilitation but does not affect intracortical inhibition. Early evidence suggests that ultrasound does not affect cortical silent period duration and that the duration of inhibition may be related to the duration of stimulation. Finally, ultrasound reduces reaction time on a simple stimulus response task. This is the first report of the effect of ultrasound on human motor cortical excitability and motor behavior and confirms previous results in the somatosensory cortex that ultrasound results in effective neuronal inhibition that confers a performance advantage.",

    "abstract": "Maturation is a process that allows synapses to acquire full functionality; failures in synaptic maturation may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. Neuroligins are postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules essential for synapse maturation, but the underlying pathways are incompletely understood. Here, we show that maturational increases in active zone stability and synaptic vesicle recycling rely on the joint action of Neuroligins and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Applying BDNF to neuronal cultures mimicked the maturation-promoting effects of overexpressing the Neuroligin isoforms NL1 or NL2. Inhibiting BDNF signaling reduced the effects of NL1 and NL2 on presynaptic maturation and of NL2 on synapse formation. Applying BDNF to NL1-knockout mouse cultures rescued defective presynaptic maturation, indicating that BDNF acts downstream of NL1 and can restore presynaptic maturation at late stages of network development. Our data introduce BDNF as a novel and essential component in a transsynaptic pathway linking Neuroligin-mediated cell adhesion, neurotrophin action and presynaptic maturation.",

    "abstract": "High altitude people required high endurance pack animals for load carrying and riding at prevalent mountainous terrains and rugged region. So far no studies have been taken to evaluate effect of loads on physiology of ponies in high altitude region. So, in this view we evaluated variation in physiological, hematological, biochemical, and cytokines indices of Zanskar ponies during load carrying at high altitude. Total twelve (12) numbers of Zanskar ponies, mare, age 4-6 years, were divided into three groups; group-A (without load), group-B (60 kg), and group-C (80 kg) of back pack loads. Track was very narrow and slippery with gravel, uneven with rocky surface and has a steep gradient of 4 km uphill at altitude 3291 to 3500 m. When we evaluate these parameters, it is understood that the heart rate, pulse rate and respiration rate was significantly (p<0.05) increased in 80 kg group among the three groups. The hematology parameters viz. hemoglobin, PCV, lymphocytes, monocytes%, ESR and eosinophil% significantly (p<0.05) changed in 80 kg group after load carrying among the three groups which was followed by control and 60 kg group. In biochemical parameters viz. LA, LDH, TP, HK, CORT, T3, CRT, AST, CK-MB, GPx, FRAP and IL-6 significantly (p<0.05) changed in 80 kg group after load carrying among the three groups which was followed by control and 60 kg group. The ALT, ALB, GLB, UR and UA significantly (p<0.05) changed in 80 kg group before and after load carrying among the three groups which was followed by control and 60 kg group. It has been concluded that, this result has revealed strong correlation of change in biomarkers level with performance in ponies during load carry. Hence, these parameters might be use for performance of endurance of Zanskar ponies in high mountain region.",

    "abstract": "Plants are versatile chemists producing a tremendous variety of specialized compounds. Here, we describe the engineering of entirely novel metabolic pathways in planta enabling generation of halogenated indigo precursors as non-natural plant products.\\n\\nIndican (indolyl-{beta}-D-glucopyranoside) is a secondary metabolite characteristic of a number of dyers plants. Its deglucosylation and subsequent oxidative dimerization leads to the blue dye, indigo. Halogenated indican derivatives are commonly used as detection reagents in histochemical and molecular biology applications; their production, however, relies largely on chemical synthesis. To attain the de novo biosynthesis in a plant-based system devoid of indican, we employed a sequence of enzymes from diverse sources, including three microbial tryptophan halogenases substituting the amino acid at either C5, C6, or C7 of the indole moiety. Subsequent processing of the halotryptophan by bacterial tryptophanase TnaA in concert with a mutant of the human cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 2A6 and glycosylation of the resulting indoxyl derivatives by an endogenous tobacco glucosyltransferase yielded corresponding haloindican variants in transiently transformed Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Accumulation levels were highest when the 5-halogenase PyrH was utilized, reaching 0.93 {+/-}0.089 mg/g dry weight of 5-chloroindican. The identity of the latter was unambiguously confirmed by NMR analysis. Moreover, our combinatorial approach, facilitated by the modular assembly capabilities of the GoldenBraid cloning system and inspired by the unique compartmentation of plant cells, afforded testing a number of alternative subcellular localizations for pathway design. In consequence, chloroplasts were validated as functional biosynthetic venues for haloindican, with the requisite reducing augmentation of the halogenases as well as the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase fulfilled by catalytic systems native to the organelle.\\n\\nThus, our study puts forward a viable alternative production platform for halogenated fine chemicals, eschewing reliance on fossil fuel resources and toxic chemicals. We further contend that in planta generation of halogenated indigoid precursors previously unknown to nature offers an extended view on and, indeed, pushes forward the established frontiers of biosynthetic capacity of plants.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIEntirely novel combinatorial pathway yielded new-to-nature halogenated indigoids.\\nC_LIO_LIAn array of specific chloro- and bromoindican regioisomers was generated.\\nC_LIO_LISignificant retrieval rates afforded unambiguous metabolite identification.\\nC_LIO_LIEngineered plants emerge as alternative manufacture chassis for fine chemicals.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Accurate quantification of drug effects is crucial for identifying pharmaceutically actionable cancer vulnerabilities. Current cell viability-based measurements often lead to biased response estimates due to varying growth rates and experimental artifacts that explain part of the inconsistency in high-throughput screening results. We developed an improved drug scoring model, normalized drug response (NDR), which makes use of both positive and negative control conditions to account for differences in cell growth rates and experimental noise to better characterize drug-induced effects. We demonstrate an improved consistency and accuracy of NDR compared to existing metrics in assessing drug responses of cancer cells in various culture models and experimental setups. Notably, NDR reliably captures both toxicity and viability responses, and differentiates a wider spectrum of drug behavior, including lethal, growth-inhibitory and growth-stimulatory modes, based on a single viability readout. The method will therefore substantially reduce the time and resources required in cell-based drug sensitivity screening.",

    "abstract": "Sequence-specific DNA binding recruits transcription factors (TFs) to the genome to regulate gene expression. Here, we perform high resolution mapping of CEBP proteins to determine how sequence dictates genomic occupancy. We demonstrate a fundamental difference between the sequence repertoire utilized by CEBPs in vivo versus the palindromic sequence preference reported by classical in vitro models, by identifying a palindromic motif at less than 1% of the genomic binding sites. On the native genome, CEBPs bind a diversity of related 10 bp sequences resulting from the fusion of degenerate and canonical half-sites. Altered DNA specificity of CEBPs in cells occurs through heterodimerization with other bZip TFs, and approximately 40% of CEBP-binding sites in primary human cells harbor motifs characteristic of CEBP heterodimers. In addition, we uncover an important role for sequence bias at core-motif-flanking bases for CEBPs and demonstrate that flanking bases regulate motif function across mammalian bZip TFs. Favorable flanking bases confer efficient TF occupancy and transcriptional activity, and DNA shape may explain how the flanks alter TF binding. Importantly, motif optimization within the 10-mer is strongly correlated with cell-type-independent recruitment of CEBP{beta}, providing key insight into how sequence sub-optimization affects genomic occupancy of widely expressed CEBPs across cell types.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances have enabled gene expression profiling of single cells at lower cost. As more data is produced there is an increasing need to integrate diverse datasets and better analyse underutilised data to gain biological insights. However, analysis of single cell RNA-seq data is challenging due to biological and technical noise which not only varies between laboratories but also between batches. Here for the first time, we apply a new generative deep learning approach called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to biological data. We apply GANs to epidermal, neural and hematopoietic scRNA-seq data spanning different labs and experimental protocols. We show that it is possible to integrate diverse scRNA-seq datasets and in doing so, our generative model is able to simulate realistic scRNA-seq data that covers the full diversity of cell types. In contrast to many machine-learning approaches, we are able to interpret internal parameters in a biologically meaningful manner. Using our generative model we are able to obtain a universal representation of epidermal differentiation and use this to predict the effect of cell state perturbations on gene expression at high time-resolution. We show that our trained neural networks identify biological state-determining genes and through analysis of these networks we can obtain inferred gene regulatory relationships. Finally, we use internal GAN learned features to perform dimensionality reduction. In combination these attributes provide a powerful framework to progress the analysis of scRNA-seq data beyond exploratory analysis of cell clusters and towards integration of multiple datasets regardless of origin.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe adaptive immune system maintains a diversity of T cells capable of recognizing a broad array of antigens. Each T cells specificity and affinity for antigens is determined by its T cell receptors (TCRs), which together across all T cells form a repertoire of tens of millions of unique receptors in each individual. Although many studies have examined how TCR repertoires change in response to disease or drugs, few have explored the temporal dynamics of the TCR repertoire in healthy individuals.\\n\\nResultsHere we report immunosequencing of TCR {beta} chains (TCR{beta}) from the blood of three healthy individuals at eight time points over one year. TCR{beta} repertoires from samples of all T cells and memory T cells clearly clustered by individual, confirming that TCR{beta} repertoires are specific to individuals across time. This individuality was absent from TCR{beta}s from naive T cells, suggesting that these differences result from an individuals antigen exposure history. Many characteristics of the TCR{beta} repertoire (e.g., alpha diversity, clonality) were stable across time, although we found evidence of T cell expansion dynamics even within healthy individuals. We further identified a subset of \\\"persistent\\\" TCR{beta}s present across all time points, and these receptors were rich in clonal and public receptors.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results revealed persistent receptors that may play a key role in immune system maintenance. They further highlight the importance of longitudinal sampling of the immune system and provide a much-needed baseline for TCR{beta} dynamics in healthy individuals. Such a baseline should help improve interpretation of changes in the TCR{beta} repertoire during disease or treatment.",

    "abstract": "A wealth of experimental data points to immunological and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here we study the role of IL-23, the microbiome, and the diet in the development of colitis. To promote IL-23 expression in vivo, we generated a mouse model in which IL-23 was conditionally expressed by CX3CR1+ myeloid cells, upon cyclic administration of tamoxifen in a specific diet (diet 2019). IL-23 expression induced an intestinal inflammatory disease that resembled ulcerative colitis in humans with cycles of acute disease and remission. The relapses were caused by the diet switch from the conventional diet used in our facility (diet 5053) to the diet 2019, and were not dependent on tamoxifen after the first cycle. The switch in the diet modified the microbiota, but did not alter the levels of IL-23. Colitis induction depended on the microbiota and required CD4 T lymphocytes. Colitis-inducing CD4+ T cells were found in the mesenteric lymph node and large intestine during remission and were able to trigger disease when transferred to lymphopenic mice, but only upon diet modification. The CD4 TCR repertoire in the diseased recipient Rag-/- mice had reduced diversity associated with the expansion of dominant T cell clones. These findings reveal a critical role for IL-23 in generation of a CD4+ T cell population in mice that is sensitive to a modification of intestinal bacterial flora subsequent to a dietary manipulation. Dietary changes occurring in the context of altered IL-23 expression may contribute to the onset and progression of IBD.",

In this study, we use phospho-proteomic mass spectrometry and mechanistic computational modeling to quantify the in vitro kinetics of individual tyrosine phosphorylation on a variety of CARs. We show that each of the ten tyrosine sites on the CD28-CD3{zeta} CAR is phosphorylated by LCK with distinct kinetics. The addition of CD28 at the N-terminal of CD3{zeta} increases the overall rate of CD3{zeta} phosphorylation. Our computational model identifies that LCK phosphorylates CD3{zeta} through a mechanism of competitive inhibition. This model agrees with previously published data in the literature and predicts that phosphatases in this system interact with CD3{zeta} through a similar mechanism of competitive inhibition. This quantitative modeling framework can be used to better understand CAR signaling and T cell activation.",
