    "abstract": "PurposeLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with substantially better prognosis in early stage as opposed to late stage disease. Identifying genetic factors for lung squamous carcinoma (SqCC) risk will enable their use in risk stratification, and personalized intensive surveillance, early detection, and prevention strategies for high-risk individuals.\\n\\nStudy Design and ParticipantsWe analyzed whole-exome sequencing datasets of 318 cases and 814 controls (discovery cohort) and then validated our findings in an independent cohort of 444 patients and 3,479 controls (validation cohort), all of European descent, totaling a combined cohort of 765 cases and 4,344 controls. We focused on rare pathogenic variants found in the ClinVar database and used penalized logistic regression to identify genes in which such variants are enriched in cases. All statistical tests were two-sided.\\n\\nResultsWe observed an overall enrichment of rare, deleterious germline variants in Fanconi Anemia genes in cases with SqCC (joint analysis OR=3.08, p=1.4e-09, 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.2-4.3). Consistent with previous studies, BRCA2 in particular exhibited an increased overall burden of rare, deleterious variants (joint OR=3.2, p=8.7e-08, 95% CI=2.1-4.7). More importantly, rare deleterious germline variants were enriched in Fanconi Anemia genes even without the BRCA2 rs11571833 variant that is strongly enriched in lung SqCC cases (joint OR=2.76, p=7.0e-04, 95% CI=1.6-4.7).\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings can be used towards the development of a genetic diagnostic test in the clinic to identify SqCC high-risk individuals, who can benefit from personalized programs, improving prognosis.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptomics has been widely applied to study grape berry development. With few exceptions, transcriptomic studies in grape are performed using the available genome sequence, PN40024, as reference. However, differences in gene content among grape accessions, which contribute to phenotypic differences among cultivars, suggest that a single reference genome does not represent the species entire gene space. Though whole genome assembly and annotation can reveal the relatively unique or \\\"private\\\" gene space of any particular cultivar, transcriptome reconstruction is a more rapid, less costly, and less computationally intensive strategy to accomplish the same goal. In this study, we used single molecule-real time sequencing (Iso-Seq) to sequence full-length cDNA and reconstruct the transcriptome of Cabernet Sauvignon berries during berry ripening. In addition, Illumina short reads from ripening berries were used to error-correct low-expression isoforms and to profile isoform expression. By comparing the annotated gene space of Cabernet Sauvignon to other grape cultivars, we demonstrate that the transcriptome reference built with Iso-Seq data represents most of the expressed genes in the grape berries and includes 1,501 cultivar-specific genes. Iso-Seq produced transcriptome profiles similar to those obtained after mapping on a complete genome reference. Together, these results justify the application of Iso-Seq to identify cultivar-specific genes and build a comprehensive reference for transcriptional profiling that circumvents the necessity of a genome reference with its associated costs and computational weight.",

    "abstract": "The development of gut microbiota during ontogeny in vertebrates is emerging as an important process influencing physiology, immune system, health, and adult fitness. However, we have little knowledge of how the gut microbiome is colonised and develops in non-model organisms, and to what extent microbial diversity and specific taxa influence changes in fitness-related traits. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to describe the successional development of the faecal microbiota in juvenile ostriches (Struthio camelus; n = 71) over their first three months of life, during which time a five-fold difference in weight was observed. We found a gradual increase in microbial diversity with age, an overall convergence in community composition among individuals, multiple colonisation and extinction events, and major taxonomic shifts coinciding with the cessation of yolk absorption. In addition, we discovered significant but complex associations between juvenile growth and microbial diversity, and identified distinct bacterial groups that had positive (Bacteroidaceae) and negative (Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae, Lactobacillaceae) correlations with the growth of individuals at specific ages. These results have broad implications for our understanding of the development of gut microbiota and its association with juvenile growth.",

    "abstract": "In the antisaccade task, subjects are instructed to saccade in the opposite direction of a peripheral visual cue (PVC). Importantly, several psychiatric disorders are associated with increased error rates in this paradigm. Despite this observation, there is no consensus about the mechanism behind antisaccade errors: while often explained as inhibition failures, some studies have suggested that errors are caused by deficits in the ability to initiate voluntary saccades. Using a computational model, we recently showed that under some conditions high latency or late errors can be explained by a race process between voluntary pro- and antisaccades. A limitation of our findings is that in our previous experiment the PVC signaled the trial type, whereas in most studies, subjects are informed about the trial type before the PVC is presented. We refer to these task designs as asynchronous (AC) and synchronous cues (SC) conditions. Here, we investigated to which extent differences in design affect the type and frequency of errors in the antisaccade task. Twenty-four subjects participated in mixed blocks of pro- and antisaccade trials in both conditions. Our results demonstrate that error rates were highly correlated across task designs and a non-negligible fraction of them were classified as late errors in both conditions. In summary, our findings indicate that errors in the AC task are the result of both inhibition failures and inaccurate voluntary action initiation.",

    "abstract": "Gaseous molecules are widespread signaling compounds, regulating the cell development process in all major plant parts. For many decades, hydrogen sulfide molecule is considered mainly for its deleterious effects on plant system. The increasing recent experimental evidence and phenomenal concepts on H2S molecule further advance our understanding of H2S interaction with plant tissues. In addition, the H2S messenger molecule is found to have positive effects on plant growth, in limited condition, to maintain the balanced homeostasis. To meet the increasing demand, and to sustain the crop yield, various crop improvement programs have been followed. However, there is a concern that traditional plant improvement method and increasing climate change has a negative impact on crop production. A major approach to combating plant stress is to evaluate and explore the alternate source mechanism(s). Towards this aim, it will be valuable to characterize the genes involved in H2S homeostasis in the staple food crop rice pan-genome. In this research, we identified 15 H2S homeostasis genes in rice and used it for the ~3k rice pan-genome analysis to find out the genetic relatedness based on single nucleotide polymorphism data. Multidimensional scale plot of 15 H2S homeostasis genes among the rice cultivars, and RNA-seq experimental data analysis under various biotic and abiotic stress shows the functional genes involved in biotic and abiotic stress. This study provides new insights into plant stress management in crop breeding and suggests how H2S gene(s) can be utilized to improve the agronomic traits in rice and other food crops.",

    "abstract": "Daphnia reproduce by cyclic-parthenogenesis, where phases of asexual reproduction are intermitted by sexual production of diapause stages. This life cycle, together with environmental sex determination, allow the comparison of gene expression between genetically identical males and females. We investigated gene expression differences between males and females in four genotypes of Daphnia magna and compared the results with published data on sex-biased gene expression in two other Daphnia species, each representing one of the major phylogenetic clades within the genus. We found that 42% of all annotated genes showed sex-biased expression in D. magna. This proportion is similar both to estimates from other Daphnia species as well as from species with genetic sex determination, suggesting that sex-biased expression is not reduced under environmental sex determination. Among 7453 single copy, one-to-one orthologs in the three Daphnia species, 707 consistently showed sex-biased expression and 675 were biased in the same direction in all three species. Hence these genes represent a core-set of genes with consistent sex-differential expression in the genus. A functional analysis identified that several of them are involved in known sex determination pathways. Moreover, 75% were overexpressed in females rather than males, a pattern that appears to be a general feature of sex-biased gene expression in Daphnia.\\n\\nShort summaryIn some species with environmental sex determination, gene expression can be compared between genetically identical males and females. Here, we investigated sex-biased expression in one such species, D. magna, and compared it with data from two congeners. We found that all three species have a common set of 675 genes with consistent differential expression and with a strong bias towards overexpression in females rather than males. Moreover, the proportion of sex-biased genes in each of the three Daphnia species was similar to Drosophila species with genetic sex determination, suggesting that sex-biased expression is not necessarily reduced under environmental sex determination.",

    "abstract": "Acetabular dysplasia is a recognized cause of hip osteoarthritis (OA). A paucity of animal models exists to investigate structural and functional changes that mediate morphology of the dysplastic hip and drive the subsequent arthritic cascade. Utilizing a novel murine model, this study investigated the role of surgically-induced unilateral instability of the postnatal hip on the initiation and progression of acetabular dysplasia and impingement up to 8-weeks post-injury. Specifically, C57BL6 mice were used to develop titrated levels of hip instability (mild, moderate, severe, and femoral head removal) at 3-weeks of age, a critical time for hip maturation. Joint shape, acetabular coverage, histomorphology, immunohistochemistry, and statistical shape modeling were used to assess overall quality of joint health and three-dimensional hip shape following 8 weeks of titrated destabilization. This titrated approach included mild, moderate, severe, and complete instability via surgical destabilization of the murine hip. Acetabular coverage was reduced following severe, but not moderate, instability. Moderate instability induced lateralization of the femoral head without dislocation, whereas severe instability led to complete dislocation and formation of pseudoacetabula. Mild instability did not result in statistically significant morphological changes to the hip. Complete destabilization via femoral head removal led to reduced joint space volume and reduced bone volume ratio in the remnant proximal femur. Collectively, these results support the notion that hip instability, driven by loss of function, leads to morphometric changes in the maturing mouse hip. This model could be useful for future studies investigating the mechanical and cellular adaptations to hip instability during maturation.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is known to store cognitive representations, or maps, that encode both positional and contextual information, critical for episodic memories and functional behavior. How path integration and contextual cues are dynamically combined and processed by the hippocampus to maintain these representations accurate over time remains unclear. To answer this question, we propose a two-way data analysis and modeling approach to CA3 multi-electrode recordings of a moving rat submitted to rapid changes of contextual (light) cues, triggering back-and-forth instabitilies between two cognitive representations (Jezek et al, Nature 478, p 246 (2011)). We develop a dual neural activity decoder, capable of independently identifying the recalled cognitive map at high temporal resolution (comparable to theta cycle) and the position of the rodent given a map. Remarkably, position can be reconstructed at any time with an accuracy comparable to fixed-context periods, even during highly unstable periods. These findings provide evidence for the capability of the hippocampal neural activity to maintain an accurate encoding of spatial and contextual variables, while one of these variables undergoes rapid changes independently of the other. To explain this result we introduce an attractor neural network model for the hippocampal activity that process inputs from external cues and the path integrator. Our model allows us to make predictions on the frequency of the cognitive map instability, its duration, and the detailed nature of the place-cell population activity, which are validated by a further analysis of the data. Our work therefore sheds light on the mechanisms by which the hippocampal network achieves and updates multi-dimensional neural representations from various input streams.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAs an animal moves in space and receives external sensory inputs, it must dynamically maintain the representations of its position and environment at all times. How the hippocampus, the brain area crucial for spatial representations, achieves this task, and manages possible conflicts between different inputs remains unclear. We propose here a comprehensive attractor neural network-based model of the hippocampus and of its multiple input streams (including self-motion). We show that this model is capable of maintaining faithful representations of positional and contextual information, and resolves conflicts by adapting internal representations to match external cues. Model predictions are confirmed by the detailed analysis of hippocampal recordings of a rat submitted to quickly varying and conflicting contextual inputs.",

    "abstract": "Extant evidence suggests that acute exercise triggers a tonic power increase in the alpha frequency band at frontal locations, which has been linked to benefits in cognitive function. However, recent literature has questioned such a selective effect on a particular frequency band, indicating a rather overall power increase across the entire frequency spectrum. Moreover, the nature of task-evoked oscillatory brain activity associated to inhibitory control after exercising, and the duration of the exercise effect, are not yet clear. Here, we investigate for the first time steady state oscillatory brain activity during and following an acute bout of aerobic exercise at two different exercise intensities (moderate-to-high and light), by means of a data-driven cluster-based approach to describe the spatio-temporal distribution of exercise-induced effects on brain function without prior assumptions on any frequency range or site of interest. We also assess the transient oscillatory brain activity elicited by stimulus presentation, as well as behavioural performance, in two inhibitory control (flanker) tasks, one performed after a short delay following the physical exercise and another completed after a rest period of 15 post-exercise to explore the time course of exercise-induced changes on brain function and cognitive performance. The results show that oscillatory brain activity increases during exercise compared to the resting state, and that this increase is higher during the moderate-to-high intensity exercise with respect to the light intensity exercise. In addition, our results show that the global pattern of increased oscillatory brain activity is not specific to any concrete surface localization in slow frequencies, while in faster frequencies this effect is located in parieto-occipital sites. Notably, the exercise-induced increase in oscillatory brain activity disappears immediately after the end of the exercise bout. Neither transient (event-related) oscillatory activity, nor behavioral performance during the flanker tasks following exercise showed significant between-intensity differences. The present findings help elucidate the effect of physical exercise on oscillatory brain activity and challenge previous research suggesting improved inhibitory control following moderate-to-high acute exercise.",

    "abstract": "The \\\"initial-dip\\\" is a transient decrease frequently observed in functional neuroimaging signals, immediately after stimulus onset, and is believed to originate from a rise in deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) caused by local neural activity. It has been shown to be more spatially specific than the hemodynamic response, and is believed to represent focal neuronal activity. However, despite being observed in various neuroimaging modalities (such as fMRI, fNIRS, etc), its origins are disputed and its neuronal correlates unknown. Here, we show that the initial-dip is dominated by a decrease in total-hemoglobin (HbT). We also find a biphasic response in HbR, with an early decrease and later rebound. However, HbT decreases were always large enough to counter spiking-induced increases in HbR. Moreover, the HbT-dip and HbR-rebound were strongly coupled to highly localized spiking activity. Our results suggest that the HbT-dip helps prevent accumulation of spiking-induced HbR-concentration in capillaries by flushing out HbT, probably by active venule dilation.",
