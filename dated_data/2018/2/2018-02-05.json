    "abstract": "In the human genome, distal enhancers are involved in regulating target genes through proxi-mal promoters by forming enhancer-promoter interactions. Although recently developed high-throughput experimental approaches have allowed us to recognize potential enhancer-promoter interactions genome-wide, it is still largely unclear to what extent the sequence-level information encoded in our genome help guide such interactions. Here we report a new computational method (named \\\"SPEID\\\") using deep learning models to predict enhancer-promoter interactions based on sequence-based features only, when the locations of putative enhancers and promoters in a particular cell type are given. Our results across six different cell types demonstrate that SPEID is effective in predicting enhancer-promoter interactions as compared to state-of-the-art methods that only use information from a single cell type. As a proof-of-principle, we also applied SPEID to identify somatic non-coding mutations in melanoma samples that may have reduced enhancer-promoter interactions in tumor genomes. This work demonstrates that deep learning models can help reveal that sequence-based features alone are sufficient to reliably predict enhancer-promoter interactions genome-wide.",

    "abstract": "Climate change represents a significant threat to amphibians, which are already imperiled. However, for many species, the relationship between demographic vital rates (survival and growth) and climate is unknown, which limits predictive models. Here we describe the life history variation of Plethodon montanus using capture-recapture data over a period of four years, at five sites along an elevational gradient to determine how survival and growth vary with temperature, precipitation, and how these relationships vary with elevation. We used a hierarchical model to estimate asymptotic size and growth rate, and used a spatial Cormack-Jolly-Seber model to estimate probability of capture and survival, as well as dispersal variance. Our results show that during the active season, growth and survival rates are both positively affected by precipitation, while survival was positively affected by temperature at all elevations, the relationship between growth rates and temperature varied along the elevational gradient. Generally at lower elevations, higher temperatures led to a decrease in growth while at higher elevations the opposite was true. During the inactive season we found elevational variation in the relationship between survival and the amount of snow; at low elevations snowfall was low but survival decreased with increasing snowfall while at higher elevations increasing snowfall lead to higher survival. Our results demonstrate that understanding how the environment can affect salamander demography to develop mechanistic models, will require knowledge of the actual environmental conditions experienced by a given population as well as an understanding of the overall differences in climate at a given site.",

    "abstract": "An emerging discovery in phylogenomics is that interspecific gene flow has played a major role in the evolution of many different organisms. To what extent is the Tree of Life not truly a tree reflecting strict \\\"vertical\\\" divergence, but rather a more general graph structure known as a phylogenetic network which also captures \\\"horizontal\\\"gene flow? The answer to this fundamental question not only depends upon densely sampled and divergent genomic sequence data, but also compu-tational methods which are capable of accurately and efficiently inferring phylogenetic networks from large-scale genomic sequence datasets. Re-cent methodological advances have attempted to address this gap. How-ever, in the 2016 performance study of Hejase and Liu, state-of-the-art methods fell well short of the scalability requirements of existing phy-logenomic studies.\\n\\nThe methodological gap remains: how can phylogenetic networks be ac-curately and efficiently inferred using genomic sequence data involving many dozens or hundreds of taxa? In this study, we address this gap by proposing a new phylogenetic divide-and-conquer method which we call FastNet. We conduct a performance study involving a range of evolu-tionary scenarios, and we demonstrate that FastNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational efficiency and topological accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Identifying causal effects in non-experimental data is an enduring challenge. One proposed solution that recently gained popularity is the idea to use genes as instrumental variables (i.e. Mendelian Randomization - MR). However, this approach is problematic because many variables of interest are genetically correlated, which implies the possibility that many genes could affect both the exposure and the outcome directly or via unobserved confounding factors. Thus, pleiotropic effects of genes are themselves a source of bias in non-experimental data that would also undermine the ability of MR to correct for endogeneity bias from non-genetic sources. Here, we propose an alternative approach, GIV regression, that provides estimates for the effect of an exposure on an outcome in the presence of pleiotropy. As a valuable byproduct, GIV regression also provides accurate estimates of the chip heritability of the outcome variable. GIV regression uses polygenic scores (PGS) for the outcome of interest which can be constructed from genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. By splitting the GWAS sample for the outcome into non-overlapping subsamples, we obtain multiple indicators of the outcome PGS that can be used as instruments for each other, and, in combination with other methods such as sibling fixed effects, can address endogeneity bias from both pleiotropy and the environment. In two empirical applications, we demonstrate that our approach produces reasonable estimates of the chip heritability of educational attainment (EA) and show that standard regression and MR provide upwardly biased estimates of the effect of body height on EA.",

In this contribution, we suggest areas in which empirical ecologists, modellers, and the emerging community of computational ecologists could engage in a constructive dialogue to build on one anothers expertise; specifically, about the need to make predictions from models actionable, about the best standards to represent ecological data, and about the proper ways to credit data collection and data reuse.

Consequently, X and Y chromosomes initially have similar gene content, but ongoing Y degeneration leads to reduced Y gene expression and eventual Y gene loss. The resulting imbalance in gene expression between Y genes and the rest of the genome is expected to reduce male fitness, especially when protein networks have components from both autosomes and sex chromosomes. A diverse set of dosage compensating mechanisms that alleviates these negative effects has been described in animals2-4. However, the early steps in the evolution of dosage compensation remain unknown and dosage compensation is poorly understood in plants5. Here we show a novel dosage compensation mechanism in the evolutionarily young XY sex determination system of the plant Silene latifolia. Genomic imprinting results in higher expression from the maternal X chromosome in both males and females. This compensates for reduced Y expression in males but results in X overexpression in females and may be detrimental. It could represent a transient early stage in the evolution of dosage compensation. Our finding has striking resemblance to the first stage proposed by Ohno for the evolution of X inactivation in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Pigmentation has emerged as a premier model for understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution, and a growing catalog of color loci is starting to reveal biases in the mutations, genes, and genetic architectures underlying color variation in the wild. However, existing studies have sampled a limited subset of taxa, color traits, and developmental stages. To expand our sample of color loci, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping analyses on two types of larval pigmentation traits that vary among populations of the redheaded pine sawfly (Neodiprion lecontei): carotenoid-based yellow body color and melanin-based spotting pattern. For both traits, our QTL models explained a substantial proportion of phenotypic variation and suggested a genetic architecture that is neither monogenic nor highly polygenic. Additionally, we used our linkage map to anchor the current N. lecontei genome assembly. With these data, we identified promising candidate genes underlying: (1) a loss of yellow pigmentation in Mid-Atlantic/northeastern populations (Cameo2 and apoLTP-II/I), and (2) a pronounced reduction in black spotting in Great-Lakes populations (yellow, TH, Dat). Several of these genes also contribute to color variation in other wild and domesticated taxa. Overall, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that predictable genes of large-effect contribute to color evolution in nature.",

    "abstract": "Hi-C is currently the most widely used assay to investigate the 3D organization of the genome and to study its role in gene regulation, DNA replication, and disease. However, Hi-C experiments are costly to perform and involve multiple complex experimental steps; thus, accurate methods for measuring the quality and reproducibility of Hi-C data are essential to determine whether the output should be used further in a study. Using real and simulated data, we profile the performance of several recently proposed methods for assessing reproducibility of population Hi-C data, including HiCRep, GenomeDISCO, HiC-Spector and QuASAR-Rep. By explicitly controlling noise and sparsity through simulations, we demonstrate the deficiencies of performing simple correlation analysis on pairs of matrices, and we show that methods developed specifically for Hi-C data produce better measures of reproducibility. We also show how to use established (e.g., ratio of intra to interchromosomal interactions) and novel (e.g., QuASAR-QC) measures to identify low quality experiments. In this work, we assess reproducibility and quality measures by varying sequencing depth, resolution and noise levels in Hi-C data from 13 cell lines, with two biological replicates each, as well as 176 simulated matrices. Through this extensive validation and benchmarking of Hi-C data, we describe best practices for reproducibility and quality assessment of Hi-C experiments.

    "abstract": "Interplay between apicobasal cell polarity modules and the cytoskeleton is critical for differentiation and integrity of epithelia. However, this coordination is poorly understood at the level of gene regulation by transcription factors. Here, we establish the Drosophila activating transcription factor 3 (atf3) as a cell polarity response gene acting downstream of the membrane-associated Scribble polarity complex. Loss of the tumor suppressors Scribble or Dlg1 induces atf3 expression via aPKC but independent of Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. Strikingly, removal of Atf3 from Dlg1 deficient cells restores polarized cytoarchitecture, levels and distribution of endosomal trafficking machinery, and differentiation. Conversely, excess Atf3 alters microtubule network, vesicular trafficking and the partition of polarity proteins along the apicobasal axis. Genomic and genetic approaches implicate Atf3 as a regulator of cytoskeleton organization and function, and identify Lamin C as one of its bona fide target genes. By affecting structural features and cell morphology, Atf3 functions in a manner distinct from other transcription factors operating downstream of disrupted cell polarity.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEpithelial cells form sheets and line both the outside and inside of our body. Their proper development and function require the asymmetric distribution of cellular components from the top to the bottom, known as apicobasal polarization. As loss of polarity hallmarks a majority of cancers in humans understanding how epithelia respond to a collapse of the apicobasal axis is of great interest. Here, we show that in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the breakdown of epithelial polarity engages Activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3), a protein that directly binds the DNA and regulates gene expression. We demonstrate that many of the pathological consequences of disturbed polarity require Atf3, as its loss in this context results in normalization of cellular architecture, vesicle trafficking and differentiation. Using unbiased genome-wide approaches we identify the genetic program controlled by Atf3 and experimentally verify select candidates. Given the evolutionary conservation of Atf3 between flies and man, we believe that our findings in the Drosophila model will contribute to a better understanding of diseases stemming from compromised epithelial polarity.",

    "abstract": "For decades, researchers have lacked the ability to rapidly correlate microbial identity with bacterial metabolism. Since specialized metabolites are critical to bacterial function and survival in the environment, we designed a data acquisition and bioinformatics technique (IDBac) that utilizes in situ matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to analyze protein and specialized metabolite spectra of single bacterial colonies from agar plates. We demonstrated the power of our approach by discriminating between two Bacillus subtilis colonies in under 30 minutes, which differ by a single genomic mutation, solely on the basis of their differential ability to produce cyclic peptide antibiotics surfactin and plipastatin. Next, we employed our IDBac technique to detect subtle intra-species differences in the production of metal scavenging acyl-desferrioxamines in a group of eight freshwater Micromonospora isolates that share >99% sequence similarity in the 16S rRNA gene. Finally, we employed our method to simultaneously extract protein and specialized metabolite MS profiles from unidentified species of Lake Michigan sponge-associated bacteria cultivated on an agar plate. In just 3 hours, we created hierarchical protein MS groupings of 11 environmental isolates (10 MS replicates each, for a total of 110 samples) that accurately mirrored phylogenetic groupings. We further distinguished isolates within these groupings, which share nearly identical 16S rRNA gene sequence identity, based on inter- and intra-species differences in specialized metabolite production. To our knowledge, IDBac is the first attempt to couple in situ MS analyses of protein content and specialized metabolite production to allow the distinction of closely related bacterial colonies.\\n\\nSignificanceMass spectrometry is a powerful technique that has been used to identify bacteria via protein content, and to assess bacterial function in an environment via analysis of specialized metabolites. However, until now these analyses have operated independently, and this has resulted in the inability to rapidly connect bacterial phylogenetic identity with patterns of specialized metabolism. To bridge this gap, we designed a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data acquisition and bioinformatics pipeline (IDBac) to discriminate both intact protein and specialized metabolite spectra directly from bacterial cells grown on agar. To our knowledge, this is the first technique that organizes bacteria into highly similar phylogenetic groups and allows for comparison of metabolic differences of hundreds of isolates in just a few hours.",

    "abstract": "Fluctuations in gonadal hormones over the course of the menstrual cycle are known to cause functional brain changes and are thought to modulate changes in the balance of cortical excitation and inhibition. Animal research has shown this occurs primarily via the major metabolite of progesterone, allopregnanolone, and its action as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. Our study used EEG to record gamma oscillations induced in the visual cortex using stationary and moving gratings. Recordings took place during twenty females' mid-luteal phase when progesterone and oestradiol are highest, and early follicular phase when progesterone and oestradiol are lowest. Significantly higher (~5 Hz) gamma frequency was recorded during the luteal compared to the follicular phase for both stimuli types. Using dynamic causal modelling these changes were linked to stronger self-inhibition of superficial pyramidal cells in the luteal compared to the follicular phase. In addition the connection from inhibitory interneurons to deep pyramidal cells was found to be stronger in the follicular compared to the luteal phase. These findings show that complex functional changes in synaptic microcircuitry occur across the menstrual cycle and that menstrual cycle phase should be taken into consideration when including female participants in research into gamma-band oscillations.",

    "abstract": "When and how oxygenic photosynthesis originated remains controversial. Wide uncertainties exist for the earliest detection of biogenic oxygen in the geochemical record or the origin of water oxidation in ancestral lineages of the phylum Cyanobacteria. A unique trait of oxygenic photosynthesis is that the process uses a Type I reaction centre with a heterodimeric core, also known as Photosystem I, made of two distinct but homologous subunits, PsaA and PsaB. In contrast, all other known Type I reaction centres in anoxygenic phototrophs have a homodimeric core. A compelling hypothesis for the evolution of a heterodimeric Type I reaction centre is that the gene duplication that allowed the divergence of PsaA and PsaB was an adaptation to incorporate photoprotective mechanisms against the formation of reactive oxygen species, therefore occurring after the origin of water oxidation to oxygen. Here I show, using sequence comparisons and Bayesian relaxed molecular clocks that this gene duplication event may have occurred in the early Archean more than 3.4 billion years ago, long before the most recent common ancestor of crown group Cyanobacteria and the Great Oxidation Event. If the origin of water oxidation predated this gene duplication event, then that would place primordial forms of oxygenic photosynthesis at a very early stage in the evolutionary history of life.",

This meta-analysis examined the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and direct current stimulation (tDCS) in the study of language production in healthy volunteers. Forty-five effect sizes from 30 studies which investigated the effects of NIBS on picture naming or verbal fluency in healthy participants were meta-analysed. Further sub-analyses investigated potential influences of stimulation type, control, target site, task, online vs. offline application, and current density of the target electrode. Random effects modelling showed a small, but reliable effect of NIBS on language production. Subsequent analyses indicated larger weighted mean effect sizes for TMS as compared to tDCS studies. No statistical differences for the other sub-analyses were observed. We conclude that NIBS is a useful method for neuroscientific studies on language production in healthy volunteers.",

    "abstract": "Coarse-grained molecular simulation models can provide significant insight into the complex behavior of protein systems, but suffer from an inherently distorted description of dynamical properties. We recently demonstrated that, for a heptapeptide of alanine residues, the structural and kinetic properties of a simulation model are linked in a rather simple way, given a certain level of physics present in the model. In this work, we extend these findings to a longer peptide, for which the representation of configuration space in terms of a full enumeration of sequences of helical/coil states along the peptide backbone is impractical. We verify the structural-kinetic relationships by scanning the parameter space of a simple native-biased model and then employ a distinct transferable model to validate and generalize the conclusions. Our results further demonstrate the validity of the previous findings, while clarifying the role of conformational entropy in the determination of the structural-kinetic relationships. More specifically, while the global, long timescale kinetic properties of a particular class of models with varying energetic parameters but approximately fixed conformational entropy are determined by the overarching structural features of the ensemble, a shift in these kinetic observables occurs for models with a distinct representation of steric interactions. At the same time, the relationship between structure and more local, faster kinetic properties is not affected by varying the conformational entropy of the model.",

    "abstract": "Activation of TMEM16F, a Ca2+ -dependent ion channel and lipid scramblase, causes massive surface membrane expansion in multiple cell types by unresolved mechanisms. We describe here that membrane expansion reflects opening of deeply invaginating surface membrane compartments when anionic phospholipids are lost from the cytoplasmic membrane leaflet. Compartments that open contain vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMPs) and can open with as little as one micromolar free Cai2+. Cationic peptides that sequester anionic phospholipids open the compartments from the cytoplasmic side without Ca2+. Monovalent cations facilitate membrane expansion via coupled permeation with anionic phospholipids through TMEM16F. When monovalent cation concentrations are reduced, membrane expansion can be reversed by changing ion gradients and membrane voltage. Depolarization closes the compartments by generating inward cation gradients through TMEM16F that promote influx of anionic phospholipids. In summary, TMEM16F-mediated membrane expansion likely does not reflect exocytosis but rather the relaxation of constrictions that close surface membrane invaginations.\\n\\nSummaryThe surface membrane of diverse cell types can be remodeled by opening and closing surface invaginations that are held shut by proteins that bind negatively charged lipids and constrict the orifices of these compartments.",

    "abstract": "Allocating reservoir flows to societal and ecosystem needs under increasing demands for water and increasing variability in climate presents challenges to resource managers. In the past, managers have operated reservoirs to achieve flow and temperature compliance points based on qualitative predictions of competing needs. Because it is difficult, if not impossible, to assess whether meeting such compliance points is efficient or equitable, new strategies for regulation are being advanced. Critical to these strategies is the need for new models with sufficient biological details to identify the effects of reservoir operations on organism growth and survival in real time. This paper evaluates the adequacy of three models of differing complexity for managing the Sacramento River temperature during the incubation of winter-run Chinook salmon. The models similarly characterize temperature-and density-dependent mortality from egg through fry survival, but use different spatial and temporal resolutions. The models all fit survival data reasonably well, but predict different reservoir operations to protect fish. Importantly, the models with the finer spatial/temporal resolution predict reservoir operations that require less flow and better protect fish when water resources are limited. The paper illustrates that shifting the focus of management from meeting compliance points to meeting the metabolic needs of the organisms yields efficiencies and identifies when water is needed and when it can be saved.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomics enables the study of complex microbial communities from myriad sources, including the remains of oral and gut microbiota preserved in archaeological dental calculus and paleofeces, respectively. While accurate taxonomic assignment is essential to this process, DNA damage, characteristic to ancient samples (e.g. reduction in fragment size), may reduce the accuracy of read taxonomic assignment. Using a set of in silico-generated metagenomic datasets we investigated how the addition of ancient DNA (aDNA) damage patterns influences microbial taxonomic assignment by five widely-used profilers: QIIME/UCLUST, MetaPhlAn2, MIDAS, CLARK-S, and MALT (BLAST-X-mode). In silico-generated datasets were designed to mimic dental plaque, consisting of 40, 100, and 200 microbial species/strains, both with and without simulated aDNA damage patterns. Following taxonomic assignment, the profiles were evaluated for species presence/absence, relative abundance, alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and specific taxonomic assignment biases. Unifrac metrics indicated that both MIDAS and MetaPhlAn2 provided the most accurate community structure reconstruction. QIIME/UCLUST, CLARK-S, and MALT had the highest number of inaccurate taxonomic assignments; however, filtering out species present at <0.1% abundance greatly increased the accuracy of CLARK-S and MALT. All programs except CLARK-S failed to detect some species from the input file that were in their databases. Ancient DNA damage resulted in minimal differences in species detection and relative abundance between simulated ancient and modern datasets for most programs. In conclusion, taxonomic profiling biases are program-specific rather than damage-dependent, and the choice of taxonomic classification program to use should be tailored to the research question.\\n\\nImportanceAncient biomolecules from oral and gut microbiome samples have been shown to preserve in the archaeological record. Studying ancient microbiome communities using metagenomic techniques offer a unique opportunity to reconstruct the evolutionary trajectories of microbial communities through time. DNA accumulates specific damage over time, which could potentially affect taxonomic classification and our ability to reconstruct community assemblages accurately. It is therefore necessary to assess whether ancient DNA (aDNA) damage patterns affect metagenomic taxonomic profiling. Here, we assessed biases in community structure, diversity, species detection, and relative abundance estimates by five popular metagenomic taxonomic classification programs using in silico-generated datasets with aDNA damage. Age-related damage patterns had minimal impact on the taxonomic profiles produced by each program, and biases were intrinsic to each program. Therefore, an appropriate classification program should be chosen that minimizes the biases related to the questions being addressed.",

Microorganisms in rivers, a major source of renewable freshwater, are significant due to their role in drinking water safety, signalling environmental contamination1, and driving global nutrient cycles2,3. However, a foundational understanding of microbial communities in rivers is lacking4, especially temporally and for viruses5-7. No studies to date have examined the composition of the free-floating river virome over time, and explanations of the underlying causes of spatial and temporal changes in riverine microbial composition, especially for viruses, remain unexplored. Here, we report relationships among riverine microbial communities and their environment across time, space, and superkingdoms (viruses, bacteria, and microeukaryotes), using metagenomics and marker-based microbiome analysis methods. We found that many superkingdom pairs were synchronous and had consistent shifts with sudden environmental change. However, synchrony strength, and relationships with environmental conditions, varied across space and superkingdoms. Variable relationships were observed with seasonal indicators and chemical conditions previously found to be predictive of bacterial community composition4,8-10, emphasizing the complexity of riverine ecosystems and raising questions around the generalisability of single-site and bacteria-only studies. In this first study of riverine viromes over time, DNA viral communities were stably distinct between sites, suggesting the similarity in riverine bacteria across significant geographic distances10-12 does not extend to viruses, and synchrony was surprisingly observed between DNA and RNA viromes. This work provides foundational data for riverine microbial dynamics in the context of environmental and chemical conditions and illustrates how a bacteria-only or single-site approach would lead to an incorrect description of microbial dynamics. We show how more holistic microbial community analysis, including viruses, is necessary to gain a more accurate and deeper understanding of microbial community dynamics.",

    "abstract": "As whole genome sequencing becomes an established component of the microbiologists toolbox, it is imperative that researchers, clinical microbiologists and public health professionals have access to genomic analysis tools for rapid extraction of epidemiologically and clinically relevant information. For the gram-negative hospital pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, initial efforts have focused on detection and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance genes and clones. However, with the resurgence of interest in alternative infection control strategies targeting Klebsiella surface polysaccharides, the ability to extract information about these antigens is increasingly important.\\n\\nHere we present Kaptive Web, an online tool for rapid typing of Klebsiella K and O loci, which encode the polysaccharide capsule and lipopolysaccharide O antigen, respectively. Kaptive Web enables users to upload and analyse genome assemblies in a web browser. Results can be downloaded in tabular format or explored in detail via the graphical interface, making it accessible for users at all levels of computational expertise.\\n\\nWe demonstrate Kaptive Webs utility by analysis of >500 K. pneumoniae genomes. We identify extensive K and O locus diversity among 201 genomes belonging to the carbapenemase- associated clonal group 258 (25 K and six O loci). Characterisation of a further 309 genomes indicates that such diversity is common among the multi-drug resistant clones and that these loci represent useful epidemiological markers for strain subtyping. These findings reinforce the need for rapid, reliable and accessible typing methods such as Kaptive Web.\\n\\nKaptive Web is available for use at kaptive.holtlab.net and source code is available at github.com/kelwyres/Kaptive-Web.",

    "abstract": "Rice is staple food of nearly half the worlds population. Rice yields must therefore increase to feed ever larger populations. By colonising rice and other plants, Herbaspirillum spp. stimulate plant growth and productivity. However the molecular factors involved are largely unknown. To further explore this interaction, the transcription profiles of Nipponbare rice roots inoculated with Herbaspirillum seropedicae were determined by RNA-seq. Mapping the 104 million reads against the Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare genome produced 65 million unique mapped reads that represented 13,840 transcripts each with at least two-times coverage. About 7.4 % (1,019) genes were differentially regulated and of these 256 changed expression levels more than two times. Several of the modulated genes encoded proteins related to plant defence (e.g. a putative probenazole inducible protein), plant disease resistance as well as enzymes involved in flavonoid and isoprenoid synthesis. Genes related to the synthesis and efflux of phytosiderophores (PS) and transport of PS-iron complexes were also induced by the bacteria. These data suggest that the bacterium represses the rice defence system while concomitantly activating iron uptake. Transcripts of H. seropedicae were also detected amongst which genes involved in nitrogen fixation, cell motility and cell wall synthesis were the most expressed.\\n\\nHighlightsRNASeq of H. seropedicae colonised rice roots showed remarkable regulation of defence, metal transport, stress and signalling genes.

    "abstract": "Describing the mechanisms that drive variation in species interaction strengths is central to understanding, predicting, and managing community dynamics. Multiple factors have been linked to trophic interaction strength variation, including species densities, species traits, and abiotic factors. Yet most empirical tests of the relative roles of multiple mechanisms that drive variation have been limited to simplified experiments that may diverge from the dynamics of natural food webs. Here, we used a field-based observational approach to quantify the roles of prey density, predator density, predator-prey body-mass ratios, prey identity, and abiotic factors in driving variation in feeding rates of reticulate sculpin (Cottus perplexus). We combined data on over 6,000 predator-prey observations with prey identification time functions to estimate 289 prey-specific feeding rates at nine stream sites in Oregon. Feeding rates on 57 prey types showed an approximately log-normal distribution, with few strong and many weak interactions. Model selection indicated that prey density, followed by prey identity, were the two most important predictors of prey-specific sculpin feeding rates. Feeding rates showed a positive, accelerating relationship with prey density that was inconsistent with predator saturation predicted by current functional response models. Feeding rates also exhibited four orders-of-magnitude in variation across prey taxonomic orders, with the lowest feeding rates observed on prey with significant anti-predator defenses. Body-mass ratios were the third most important predictor variable, showing a hump-shaped relationship with the highest feeding rates at intermediate ratios. Sculpin density was negatively correlated with feeding rates, consistent with the presence of intraspecific predator interference. Our results highlight how multiple co-occurring drivers shape trophic interactions in nature and underscore ways in which simplified experiments or reliance on scaling laws alone may lead to biased inferences about the structure and dynamics of species-rich food webs.",

    "abstract": "Advances in calcium imaging have made it possible to record from an increasingly larger number of neurons simultaneously. Neuroscientists can now routinely image hundreds to thousands of individual neurons. With the continued neurotechnology development effort, it is expected that millions of neurons could soon be simultaneously measured. An emerging technical challenge that parallels the advancement in imaging such a large number of individual neurons is the processing of correspondingly large datasets, an important step of which is the identification of individual neurons. Traditional methods rely mainly on manual or semi-manual inspection, which cannot be scaled to processing large datasets. To address this challenge, we have developed an automated cell segmentation method, which is referred to as Automated Cell Segmentation by Adaptive Thresholding (ACSAT). ACSAT includes an iterative procedure that automatically calculates global and local threshold values during each iteration based on image pixel intensities. As such, the algorithm is capable of handling morphological variations and dynamic changes in fluorescence intensities in different calcium imaging datasets. In addition, ACSAT computes adaptive threshold values based on a time-collapsed image that is representative of the image sequence, and thus ACSAT provides segmentation results at a fast speed. We tested the algorithm on wide-field calcium imaging datasets in the brain regions of hippocampus and striatum in mice. ACSAT achieved precision and recall rates of approximately 80% when compared to individual neurons that are verified by human inspection. Additionally, ACSAT successfully detected low-intensity neurons that were initially undetected by humans.\\n\\nSignificanceACSAT automatically segments cells in large scale wide-field calcium imaging datasets. It is based on adaptive thresholding at both global and local levels, implemented in an iterative process to identify individual neurons in a time-collapsed image from an image sequence. It is therefore capable of handling variation in cell morphology and dynamic changes between different calcium imaging datasets at a fast speed. Based on tests performed on two datasets from mouse hippocampus and striatum, ACSAT performed comparable to human referees and was even able to detect low-intensity neurons that were initially undetected by human referees.",

    "abstract": "Sec61p is the channel-forming subunit of the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex that mediates co-translational protein import into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In yeast, proteins can also be post-translationally translocated by the hetero-heptameric Sec complex, composed of the Sec61 and the Sec63 complexes. The Sec61 channel is also a candidate for the dislocation channel for misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol during ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The structure of the Sec61 complex is highly conserved, but the roles of its N-terminal acetylation and its amphipathic N-terminal helix are unknown so far. To gain insight into the function of the Sec61p N-terminus, we mutated its N-acetylation site, deleted its amphipathic helix, or both the helix and the N-acetylation site. Mutation of the N-acetylation site on its own had no effect on protein import into the ER in intact cells, but resulted in an ERAD defect. Yeast expressing sec61 without the N-terminal amphipathic helix displayed severe growth defects and had profound defects in post-translational protein import into the ER. Nevertheless the formation of the hetero-heptameric Sec complex was not affected. Instead, the lack of the N-terminal amphipathic helix compromised the integrity of the heterotrimeric Sec61 complex. We conclude that the N-terminal helix of Sec61p is required for post-translational protein import into the ER and Sec61 complex stability, whereas N-terminal acetylation of Sec61p plays a role in ERAD.",

    "abstract": "We report that in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC), extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a vitally important role in defining the characteristics of cancer vs. normal, as it is a compartment with significant enrichment of known OSCC biomarkers, and the number of genes constituting ECM are more prominently upregulated in OSCC than almost all the rest of the cancer types. This is probably due to the constant exposure of oral cavity to external stimuli, resulting in the ECM remodeling, which further is a key player in tumor invasion. While we showed ECM molecules alone could well distinguish oral cancer from normal tissue samples, a significant portion of these predictive ECM molecules, share the same transcriptional regulator, NFKB1, a master regulator of immune response. We further studied the level of involvement of the immune system in OSCC, and found that the immune composition in OSCC is distinctly different from the other cancer types. OSCC has a higher level of infiltration of adaptive immune cells, including B cell, T cell and neutrophil, compared with other cancer types, while a lower level of infiltration of innate immune, including macrophage and monocyte. Previous studies have revealed the roles of ECM and immune system in OSCC development, and our study showed that ECM plays a very prominent role in OSCC, subject to the complex microenvironment in oral cavity, particularly the immune system profile, and our association analysis revealed it is likely the interactions between ECM and immune cells that define the highly invasive property of OSCC.",

    "abstract": "The actin family of cytoskeletal proteins is essential to the physiology of virtually all archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. While X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy have revealed structural homologies among actin-family proteins, these techniques cannot probe molecular-scale conformational dynamics. Here, we use all-atom molecular dynamic simulations to reveal conserved dynamical behaviors in four prokaryotic actin homologs: MreB, FtsA, ParM, and crenactin. We demonstrate that the majority of the conformational dynamics of prokaryotic actins can be explained by treating the four subdomains as rigid bodies. MreB, ParM, and FtsA monomers exhibited nucleotide-dependent dihedral and opening angles, while crenactin monomer dynamics were nucleotide-independent. We further determine that the opening angle of ParM is sensitive to a specific interaction between subdomains. Steered molecular dynamics simulations of MreB, FtsA, and crenactin dimers revealed that changes in subunit dihedral angle lead to intersubunit bending or twist, suggesting a conserved mechanism for regulating filament structure. Taken together, our results provide molecular-scale insights into the nucleotide and polymerization dependencies of the structure of prokaryotic actins, suggesting mechanisms for how these structural features are linked to their diverse functions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSimulations are a critical tool for uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying biological form and function.

Dihedral angles and opening angles in monomers of bacterial MreB, FtsA, and ParM were all sensitive to whether the subunit was bound to ATP or ADP, unlike in the archaeal homolog crenactin. In simulations of MreB, FtsA, and crenactin dimers, changes in subunit dihedral angle led to bending or twisting in filaments of these proteins, suggesting a mechanism for regulating the properties of large filaments.

    "abstract": "Aberrant activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in carcinoma cells contributes to increased migration and invasion, metastasis, drug resistance, and tumor-initiating capacity. EMT is not always a binary process, rather cells may exhibit a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype. ZEB1 - a key transcription factor driving EMT - can both induce and maintain a mesenchymal phenotype. Recent studies have identified two novel autocrine feedback loops utilizing ESRP1, HAS2, and CD44 that maintain high levels of ZEB1. However, how the crosstalk between these feedback loops alters the dynamics of epithelial-hybrid-mesenchymal transition remains elusive. Here, using an integrated theoretical-experimental framework, we identify that these feedback loops can enable cells to stably maintain a hybrid E/M phenotype. Moreover, computational analysis identifies the regulation of ESRP1 as a crucial node, a prediction that is validated by two complementary experiments showing that (a) overexpression of ESRP1 reverts EMT in MCF10A cells treated with TGF{beta} for 21 days, and (b) knockdown of ESRP1 in stable hybrid E/M H1975 cells drives EMT. Finally, in multiple breast cancer datasets, high levels of ESRP1, ESRP1/HAS2, and ESRP1/ZEB1 correlates with poor prognosis, supporting the relevance of ZEB1/ESRP1 and ZEB1/HAS2 axes in tumor progression. Together, our results unravel how these interconnected feedback loops act in concert to regulate ZEB1 levels and to drive the dynamics of epithelial-hybrid-mesenchymal transition.",

    "abstract": "Many cancer cells contain more than two centrosomes, yet these cancer cells can form bipolar spindles and appear to proliferate normally, instead of committing lethal mitoses with multipolar spindles. It is shown that extra centrosomes are clustered into two pseudo-bipolar spindle poles, thereby escaping from multipolarity. Human kinesin-14 (HSET or KIFC1), a minus end-directed motor, plays a crucial role in centrosome clustering and as such, HSET is essential for cell viability only in cancer cells with supernumerary centrosomes, but not in non-transformed cells. Accordingly, HSET is deemed to be an efficient chemotherapeutic target to selectively kill cancer cells. Recently, three HSET inhibitors (AZ82, CW069 and SR31527) have been reported, but their specificity, efficacy and off-target cytotoxicity have not been evaluated rigorously. Here we show that these inhibitors on their own are cytotoxic to fission yeast, suggesting that they have other targets in vivo except for kinesin-14. Nonetheless, intriguingly, AZ82 can neutralize overproduced HSET and partially rescue its lethality. This methodology of protein overproduction in fission yeast provides a convenient, functional assay system by which to screen for not only selective human kinesin-14 inhibitors but also those against other molecules of interest.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms that govern organelle adaptation and remodeling remain poorly defined. The endo-lysosomal system degrades cargo from various routes including endocytosis, phagocytosis and autophagy. For phagocytes, endosomes and lysosomes (endo-lysosomes) are kingpin organelles since they are essential to kill pathogens and process and present antigens. During phagocyte activation, endo-lysosomes undergo a morphological transformation, going from a collection of dozens of globular structures to a tubular network in a process that requires the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-AKT-mTOR signalling pathway. Here, we show that the endo-lysosomal system undergoes an expansion in volume and holding capacity during phagocyte activation within 2 h of LPS stimulation. Endo-lysosomal expansion was paralleled by an increase in lysosomal protein levels, but this was unexpectedly largely independent of TFEB and TFE3 transcription factors, known to scale up lysosome biogenesis. Instead, we demonstrate a hitherto unappreciated mechanism of acute organelle expansion via mTORC1-dependent increase in translation, which appears to be mediated by both, S6Ks and 4E-BPs. Moreover, we show that stimulation of RAW cells with LPS alters translation of a subset but not all of mRNAs encoding endo-lysosomal proteins, thereby suggesting that endo-lysosome expansion is accompanied by functional remodelling. Importantly, mTORC1-dependent increase in translation activity was necessary for efficient and rapid antigen presentation by dendritic cells. Collectively, we identified a previously unknown and functionally relevant mechanism for endo-lysosome expansion that relies on mTORC1-dependent translation to stimulate endo-lysosome biogenesis in response to an infection signal.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia, a major inducer of angiogenesis, is known to trigger major changes of gene expression at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, global protein synthesis is blocked while internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) allow specific mRNAs to be translated. Here we report the transcriptome and translatome signatures of (lymph)angiogenic genes in hypoxic HL-1 cardiomyocytes: most genes are not induced at the transcriptome-, but at the translatome level, including all IRES-containing mRNAs. Our data reveal activation of (lymph)angiogenic mRNA IRESs in early hypoxia. We identify vasohibin1 (VASH1) as an IRES trans-acting factor (ITAF) able to activate FGF1 and VEGFD IRESs in hypoxia while it inhibits several IRESs in normoxia. Thus this new ITAF may have opposite effects on IRES activities. These data suggest a generalized process of IRES-dependent translational induction of (lymph)angiogenic growth factors expression in early hypoxia, whose pathophysiological relevance is to trigger formation of new functional vessels in ischemic heart. VASH1 is not always required, indicating that the IRESome composition is variable, thus allowing subgroups of IRESs to be activated under the control of different ITAFs.",

The independence and relative strength of sexual isolation are thus difficult to assess. Here we take advantage of a pair of isopod species (Jaera albifrons and J. praehirsuta) that show sexual isolation and coexist in populations where they share the same habitat or not (i.e. without or with ecological isolation). Using no-choice trials and a free-choice experimental population, we estimated the strength of sexual isolation between J. albifrons and J. praehirsuta individuals originating from these different ecological contexts. We found that sexual isolation is strong in presence and absence of ecological isolation, but that it is asymmetric and fails to prevent gene flow entirely. Post-zygotic barriers were low, and there was no sexual isolation within J. praehirsuta across habitats. The J. albifrons / J. praehirsuta species pair thus provides an example where the role of sexual isolation as a barrier to gene flow i) does not depend upon current ecological isolation, ii) seems to have evolved independently of local ecological conditions and hybridization costs, but iii) is unable to complete speciation entirely on its own.",

However, the biological mechanisms associated with this decreased risk are elusive. One way to ascertain biological changes influenced by physical activity is by monitoring changes in how genes are expressed. In this investigation, we conducted a transcriptome-wide association study of physical activity, meta-analyzing 20 independent studies to increase power for discovery of genes expressed before and after physical activity. Further, we hypothesize that genes identified in physical activity are expressed in obesity, inflammation, major depressive disorder and healthy aging.\\n\\nResultsOur analysis identified thirty (30) transcripts induced by physical activity (PA signature), at an FDR < 0.05. Twenty (20) of these transcripts, including COL4A3, CAMKD1, SLC4A5, EPS15L1, RBM33, and CACNG1, are up-regulated and ten (10) transcripts including CRY1, ZNF346, SDF4, ANXA1 and YWHAZ are down-regulated. We find that several of these physical activity transcripts are associated and biologically concordant in direction with body mass index, white blood cell count, and healthy aging.\\n\\nConclusionspowerful approach, we found thirty genes that were putatively influenced by physical activity, eight of which are inversely associated with body mass index, thirteen inversely associated with white blood cell count, and three associated and concordant with healthy aging. One gene was significant and concordant with major depressive disorder.

The genome-wide distribution of 5- hmC in human peripheral blood cells correlates well with 5-hmC DNA immunoprecipitation (hMeDIP) sequencing. However, the long read length of 100 kbp-1Mbp produces 5-hmC profiles across variable genomic regions that failed to showup in the sequencing data. In addition, optical 5-hmC mapping shows strong correlation between the 5-hmC density in gene bodies and the corresponding level of gene expression.

    "abstract": "Small non-coding RNAs have gained substantial attention due to their roles in animal development and human disorders. Among them, microRNAs are unique because individual gene sequences are conserved across the animal kingdom. In addition, unique and mechanistically well understood features can clearly distinguish bona fide miRNAs from the myriad other small RNAs generated by cells. However, making this separation is not a common practice and, thus, not surprisingly, the heterogeneous quality of available miRNA complements has become a major concern in microRNA research. We addressed this by extensively expanding our curated microRNA gene database MirGeneDB to 45 organisms that represent the full taxonomic breadth of Metazoa. By consistently annotating and naming more than 10,900 microRNA genes in these organisms, we show that previous microRNA annotations contained not only many false positives, but surprisingly lacked more than 2,100 bona fide microRNAs. Indeed, curated microRNA complements of closely related organisms are very similar and can be used to reconstruct Metazoan evolution. MirGeneDB represents a robust platform for microRNA-based research, providing deeper and more significant insights into the biology and evolution of miRNAs but also biomedical and biomarker research.

We were able to silence the silicon transporter gene (SIT) by siRNA, and hence, to suppress the lorica (characteristic siliceous basket) formation. High gene silencing efficiency was determined and measured by light microscope and RT-qPCR. In addition, only low cytotoxic effects of CPP were detected. Our new method allows the reliable and efficient transfection of choanoflagellates, finally enabling us to verify the function of genes, thought to be involved in cell adhesion or cell signaling by silencing them via siRNA.

    "abstract": "Spontaneous emergence of synchronized population activity is a characteristic feature of developing brain circuits. Recent experiments in the developing neo-cortex showed the existence of driver cells able to impact the synchronization dynamics when single-handedly stimulated. We have developed a spiking network model capable to reproduce the experimental results, thus identifying two classes of driver cells: functional hubs and low functionally connected (LC) neurons. The functional hubs arranged in a clique orchestrated the synchronization build-up, while the LC drivers were lately or not at all recruited in the synchronization process. Notwithstanding, they were able to alter the network state when stimulated by modifying the temporal activation of the functional clique or even its composition. LC drivers can lead either to higher population synchrony or even to the arrest of population dynamics, upon stimulation. Noticeably, some LC driver can display both effects depending on the received stimulus. We show that in the model the presence of inhibitory neurons together with the assumption that younger cells are more excitable and less connected is crucial for the emergence of LC drivers. These results provide a further understanding of the structural-functional mechanisms underlying synchronized firings in developing circuits possibly related to the coordinated activity of cell assemblies in the adult brain.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThere is timely interest on the impact of peculiar neurons (driver cells) and of small neuronal sub-networks (cliques) on operational brain dynamics. We first provide experimental data concerning the effect of stimulated driver cells on the bursting activity observable in the developing entorhinal cortex. Secondly, we develop a network model able to fully reproduce the experimental observations. Analogously to the experiments two types of driver cells can be identified: functional hubs and low functionally connected (LC) drivers. We explain the role of hub neurons, arranged in a clique, for the orchestration of the bursting activity in control conditions. Furthermore, we report a new mechanism, which can explain why and how LC drivers emerge in the structural-functional organization of the enthorinal cortex.",

They placed electrodes on each mastoid, and applied both right and left anodal stimulation. Ocular torsion and visual tilt were measured under different stimulation intensities. New modelling introduced here demonstrates that directly proportional linear models fit reasonably well to the relationship between vestibular input and visual tilt, but not to that between vestibular input and ocular torsion. Instead, an exponential model characterised by a decreasing slope and an asymptote fitted best. These results demonstrate that in the results presented by Zink et al., ocular torsion could not completely account for visual tilt. This suggests that vestibular input is processed centrally to stabilise vision when ocular torsion is insufficient. Potential mechanisms and seemingly conflicting literature are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), play a growing role in the treatment of neurological disorders. However, the mechanisms by which electric fields modulate cortical network activity are only partially understood. To explore the spatiotemporal modulation of cortical activity by electric fields (DC fields), we exposed neocortical slices to constant fields of varying intensity and direction and we measured their effect on the low (<1 Hz) and high frequencies (beta 15-30 Hz and gamma 30-90 Hz) of spontaneously generated cortical oscillations. Slow oscillations consist of Up (active) and Down (silent) states. We found that DC fields ranging from -6 to +6 V/m induced an exponential increase in the frequency of slow oscillations through the regulation of the excitability and duration of Down states, while hardly affecting Up states duration. A computational model based on the mean-field theory of attractor dynamics provided a mechanistic and quantitative description of the network dynamics underlying such precise modulation of slow oscillatory frequency. The modulation of high frequencies by DC fields was less consistent, the high frequency power varying with the intensity of the fields only in a fraction of slices. Interestingly, negative DC fields of increasing intensities progressively and effectively reversed the increase in high frequency power induced by kainate application. Our findings have implications for the understanding of cortical oscillations and the mechanisms by which they are modulated by DC fields and may contribute to the future development of tools with an accurate spatiotemporal control of cortical activity.\\n\\nSignificance statementActing on the brain through electrical stimulation in order to correct dysfunctions or to induce functional recovery is a relatively common technique nowadays used in the clinical realm. In spite of the existence of previous studies on the effect of electric fields on neuronal and network physiology, questions regarding the mechanisms underlying exogenous electrical modulation of cortical dynamics still remain open. We demonstrate that continuous electric fields between -6 and +6 V/m induce a precise modulation of slow and fast cortical rhythms. Based on both experimental evidence and theoretical analysis, we describe some of the mechanistic underpinnings at play and provide useful information for the development of tools with better spatiotemporal control of cortical activity.",

    "abstract": "The human whipworm Trichuris trichiura is a parasite that infects around 500 million people globally, with consequences including damage to physical growth and educational performance. Current drugs such as mebendazole have a notable lack of efficacy against whipworm, compared to other soil-transmitted helminths. Mass drug administration programs are therefore unlikely to achieve eradication and new treatments for trichuriasis are desperately needed. All current drug control strategies focus on post-infection eradication, targeting the parasite in vivo. Here we propose developing novel anthelmintics which target the egg stage of the parasite in the soil as an adjunct environmental strategy. As evidence in support of such an approach we describe the actions of a new class of anthelmintic compounds, the 2,4-diaminothieno[3,2-d]pyrimidines (DATPs). This compound class has found broad utility in medicinal chemistry, but has not previously been described as having anthelmintic activity. Importantly, these compounds show efficacy against not only the adult parasite, but also both the embryonated and unembryonated egg stages and thereby may enable a break in the parasite lifecycle.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe human whipworm, Trichuris trichiura, infects around 500 million people globally, impacting on their physical growth and educational performance. There are currently huge mass drug administration (MDA) programs aiming to control whipworm, along with the other major soil transmitted helminths, Ascaris and hookworm. However single doses of albendazole and mebendazole, which are used in MDA, have particularly poor effectiveness against whipworm, with cure rates less than 40%. This means that MDA may not be able to control and eliminate whipworm infection, and risks the spread of resistance to albendazole and mebendazole in the parasite population.\\n\\nWe are attempting to develop new treatments for parasitic worm infection, particularly focused on whipworm. We report the identification of a class of compounds, diaminothienopyrimidines (DATPs), which have not previously been described as anthelmintics. These compounds are effective against adult stages of whipworm, and also block the development of the model nematode C. elegans.\\n\\nOur DATP compounds reduce the ability of treated eggs to successfully establish infection in a mouse model of human whipworm. These results support a potential environmental spray to control whipworm by targeting the infectious egg stage in environmental hotspots.",

    "abstract": "Plants need to cope with strong variations in the nitrogen content of the soil solution. Although many molecular actors are being discovered concerning how plants perceive NO3- provision, it is less clear how plants recognize a lack of Nitrogen. Indeed, following N removal plants activate their Nitrogen Starvation Response (NSR) being characterized in particular by the activation of very high affinity nitrate transport systems (NRT2.4, NRT2.5) and other sentinel genes such as GDH3. Here we show using a combination of functional genomics (via TF perturbation) and molecular physiology studies, that the GARP Transcription Factors (TFs) belonging the HHO sub-family are important regulators of the NSR through two potential mechanisms. First, HHOs directly repress NRT2.4 and NRT2.5 high-affinity nitrate transporters. Genotypes affected in HHO genes (mutants and overexpressors) display modified high-affinity nitrate transport activities opening interesting perspectives in biotechnology applications. Second, we show that Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are important to control NSR in wild type plants and that HRS1 and HHO1 overexpressors are affected in their ROS content, defining a potential feedforward branch of the signaling pathway. Taken together our results define two new classes of molecular actors in the control of NSR including ROS and the first transcription factors to date. This work (i) opens perspectives on a poorly understood nutrient related signaling pathway, and (ii) defines targets for molecular breeding of plants with enhanced NO3- uptake.",

    "abstract": "Log D is one of the important parameters used in Lipinskis rule to assess the druggability of a molecule in pharmaceutical formulations. It represents the logarithm (log10) of the distribution coefficient (D) of a molecule. The distribution coefficient is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the sum of ionized and unionized species of a molecule distributed between a hydrophobic organic phase and an aqueous buffer phase. Since the pH affects the ionic state of a molecule, log D value (which is dependent on the concentrations of the ionized species) also becomes dependent on pH. In this work, the conventional algebraic method is compared with a more generalized  dynamic approach to model the distribution coefficient of amphoteric, diamino-monoprotic molecule and monoprotic acid in the presence of salt or co-solvent. Recently reported experimental log D data of amphoteric molecules such as nalidixic acid, mebendazole, benazepril and telmisartan, were analyzed using both these approaches to show their equivalence.\\n\\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/259770_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (17K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17c4988org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bf859corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dccb4dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a766a1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Ideally, principles and protocols will be drawn up in advance, facilitating expediency and trust, for rapid deployment early in an epidemic. Here, we attempt a summary of the scientific, ethical and feasibility considerations relevant to different trial designs. We focus on four elements of design choices which, in our view, are most fundamental to designing an experimental vaccine trial and for which the most distinctive issues arise in the setting of an emerging infectious disease for which no proven vaccines exist: 1) randomization unit, 2) trial population, 3) comparator intervention and 4) trial implementation. Likewise, we focus on three of several ethical considerations in clinical research, namely the trials social and scientific value, its risk-benefit profile and its participant selection. A catalogue of possible designs to guide trial design choices is offered, along with a systematic evaluation of the benefits and drawbacks of each in given contexts.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA massive cholera epidemic struck Haiti on October 2010. As part of the national cholera elimination plan, the Haitian government, UNICEF and other international partners launched a nationwide alert-response strategy from July 2013. This strategy established a coordinated methodology to rapidly target cholera-affected communities with WaSH (water sanitation and hygiene) response interventions conducted by field mobile teams. An innovative red-orange-green alert system was established, based on routine surveillance data, to weekly monitor the epidemic.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal findingsWe used cholera consolidated surveillance databases, alert records and details of 31,306 response interventions notified by WaSH mobile teams to describe and assess the implementation of this approach between July 2013 and June 2017. Response to red and orange alerts was heterogeneous across the country, but significantly improved throughout the study period so that 75% of red and orange alerts were responded within the same epidemiological week during the 1st semester of 2017. Numbers of persons educated about cholera, houses decontaminated by chlorine spraying, households which received water chlorination tablets and water sources that were chlorinated during the same week as cholera alerts significantly increased. Alerts appeared to be an interesting and simple indicator to monitor the dynamic of the epidemic and assess the implementation of response activities.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceThe implementation of a nationwide alert-response strategy against cholera in Haiti was feasible albeit with certain obstacles. Its cost was less than USD 8 million per year. Continuing this strategy seems essential to eventually defeat cholera in Haiti while ambitious long-term water and sanitation projects are conducted in vulnerable areas. It constitutes a core element of the current national plan for cholera elimination of the Haitian Government.",

    "abstract": "Brain organization can be appreciated across multiple spatial and temporal scales, where each scale affects the other in the emergent functions that we appreciate as cognition. As a complex adaptive system, the interplay of these scales in the brain represents the information that ultimately supports what we think and do. The dynamics of these multiscale operations can be quantified with measures of complexity, which are sensitive to the balance between information that is coded in local cell populations and that captured in the network interactions between populations. This local vs. global balance has its foundation in the structural connectivity of the brain, which is then realized through the dynamics of cell populations and their ensuing interactions with other populations. Considering brain function and cognition in this way enables a different perspective on the changes in cognitive function in aging.\\n\\nOur initial work examined changes in brain signal complexity from childhood to adulthood. Across two independent studies, we observed an overall increase in signal complexity with maturation, which also correlated with more stable and accurate cognitive performance. There was some suggestion that the maximal change occurs in medial posterior cortical areas, which have been considered \\\"network hubs\\\" of the brain. In extending to study to healthy aging, we observed a scale dependent change in brain complexity across three independent studies. Healthy aging brings a shift in local/global balance, where more information is coded in local dynamics and less in global interactions. This balance is associated with better cognitive performance, and interestingly in a more active lifestyle. It also seems that the lack of this shift in local/global balance is predictive of worse cognitive performance and potentially predictive of additional decline indicative of dementia.",

Dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory provides compact models to describe the acquisition and allocation of energy by organisms over their full life cycle. However, estimating DEB model parameters, and their associated uncertainties and covariances, is not trivial. Bayesian inference provides a coherent way to estimate parameter uncertainty, and propagate it through the model, while also making use of prior information to constrain the parameter space. We outline a Bayesian inference approach for energy budget models and provide two case studies - based on a simplified DEBkiss model, and the standard DEB model - detailing the implementation of such inference procedures using the open-source software package deBInfer. We demonstrate how DEB and DEBkiss parameters can be estimated in a Bayesian framework, but our results also highlight the difficulty of identifying DEB model parameters which serves as a reminder that fitting these models requires statistical caution.",

Here, we tested the hypothesis that scopoletin, an active principle obtained from Morinda citrifolia (MC), efficiently quenches oxidative stress through DJ-1/Nrf2 signalling and ameliorates rotenone-induced PD. Despite reducing the oxidative stress, administration of MC extract (MCE) has lessened the protein aggregation as evident from decreased levels of nitrotyrosine and -Synuclein. In vitro studies revealed that scopoletin lessened rotenone-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells through preventing oxidative injury. Particularly, scopoletin markedly up-regulated DJ-1, which then promoted the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and transactivation of antioxidant genes. Furthermore, we found that scopoletin prevent the nuclear exportation of Nrf2 by reducing the levels of Keap1 and thereby enhancing the neuronal defence system. Overall, our findings suggest that scopoletin acts through DJ-1 mediated Nrf2 signalling to protect the brain from rotenone-induced oxidative stress and PD. Thus, we postulate that scopoletin could be a potential drug to treat PD.",

Interestingly, these domains also bind to syndecan cell-surface receptors, promoting attachment of fibroblasts and endothelial cells. We next explore application of these multifunctional laminin HBDs in skin healing in the type 2 diabetic mouse. We demonstrate that covalent incorporation of laminin HBDs into fibrin matrix enables the slow-release of GFs. Incorporation of the 33043-3067 laminin HBD significantly enhances in vivo wound-healing efficacy of vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF)-A165 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, under conditions where the GFs alone in fibrin are inefficacious.

Here, we present a miniaturized, wireless platform - \\\"MR-Link\\\" (Multimodal Recording Link) that provides a hardware solution for simultaneous electrophysiological and fMRI signal acquisition. The device detects the changes in the electromagnetic field during fMRI to synchronize amplification and sampling of electrophysiological signals with minimal artifacts. It wirelessly transmits the recorded data at a frequency detectable by the MR-receiver coil. The transmitted data is readily separable from MRI in the frequency domain. To demonstrate its efficacy, we used this device to record electrocardiograms and somatosensory evoked potential during concurrent fMRI scans. The device minimized the fMRI-induced artifacts in electrophysiological data and wirelessly transmitted the data back to the receiver coil without compromising fMRI signal quality. The device is compact (22 mm dia., 2gms) and can be placed within the MR-bore to precisely synchronize with fMRI. Therefore, MR-Link offers an inexpensive system by eliminating the need for amplifiers with a high dynamic range, high-speed sampling, additional storage or synchronization hardware for electrophysiological signal acquisition. It is expected to enable a broader range of applications of simultaneous fMRI and electrophysiology in animals and humans.",

    "abstract": "MotivationWhole-genome alignment is an important problem in genomics for comparing different species, mapping draft assemblies to reference genomes, and identifying repeats. However, for large plant and animal genomes, this task remains compute and memory intensive.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce an approximate algorithm for computing local alignment boundaries between long DNA sequences. Given a minimum alignment length and an identity threshold, our algorithm computes the desired alignment boundaries and identity estimates using kmer-based statistics, and maintains sufficient probabilistic guarantees on the output sensitivity. Further, to prioritize higher scoring alignment intervals, we develop a plane-sweep based filtering technique which is theoretically optimal and practically efficient. Implementation of these ideas resulted in a fast and accurate assembly-to-genome and genome-to-genome mapper. As a result, we were able to map an error-corrected whole-genome NA12878 human assembly to the hg38 human reference genome in about one minute total execution time and < 4 GB memory using 8 CPU threads, achieving more than an order of magnitude improvement in both runtime and memory over competing methods. Recall accuracy of computed alignment boundaries was consistently found to be > 97% on multiple datasets. Finally, we performed a sensitive self-alignment of the human genome to compute all duplications of length [&ge;] 1 Kbp and [&ge;] 90% identity. The reported output achieves good recall and covers 5% more bases than the current UCSC genome browsers segmental duplication annotation.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/marbl/MashMap\\n\\nContactadam.phillippy@nih.gov, aluru@cc.gatech.edu",

    "abstract": "We present a new method, TrackSig, to estimate the evolutionary trajectories of signatures of different somatic mutational processes from DNA sequencing data from a single, bulk tumour sample. TrackSig uses probability distributions over mutation types, called mutational signatures, to represent different mutational processes and detects the changes in the signature activity using an optimal segmentation algorithm that groups somatic mutations based on their estimated cancer cellular fraction (CCF) and their mutation type (e.g. CAG->CTG). We use two different simulation frameworks to assess both TrackSigs reconstruction accuracy and its robustness to violations of its assumptions, as well as to compare it to a baseline approach. We find 2-4% median error in reconstructing the signature activities on simulations with varying difficulty with one to three subclones at an average depth of 30x. The size and the direction of the activity change is consistent in 83% and 95% of cases respectively. There were an average of 0.02 missed and 0.12 false positive subclones per sample. In our simulations, grouping mutations by mutation type (TrackSig), rather than by clustering CCF (baseline strategy), performs better at estimating signature activities and at identifying subclonal populations in the complex scenarios like branching, CNA gain, violation of infinite site assumption, and the inclusion of neutrally evolving mutations.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy suggest a possibility of harnessing the immune system to defeat malignant tumors, but complex immunosuppressive microenvironment confined the therapeutic benefits to a minority of patients with solid tumors. Here we constructed a lentivector based inducible system to evaluate the therapeutic effect of cytokines in established tumors. Doxycycline (Dox) induced local expression of cytokine combinations exhibited strong synergistic effect, leading to complete regression of tumors. Notably, IL12+GMCSF+IL2 expression induced eradication of tumors in all mice tolerated with this treatment, including those bearing large tumors of ~15mm in diameter, and generated an intensive systemic antitumor immunity. Other combinations with similar immune regulatory roles also induced tumor elimination in a majority of mice. Moreover, intratumoral injection of chitosan/IL12+GMCSF+IL2 solution induced complete response in all tested syngeneic tumor models, regardless of various tumor immunograms. These results provide a versatile method for the immunotherapy of intractable malignant neoplasm.",

    "abstract": "According to theory, edge populations may be the best suited to initiate range expansions and climate-driven range shifts if they are locally adapted to extreme edge conditions, or the worst suited to colonize beyond-range habitat if their offspring are genetically and competitively inferior. We tested these contrasting predictions by comparing fitness of low, mid, and high-elevation (edge) populations of the annual Rhinanthus minor, transplanted throughout and above its elevational distribution under natural and experimentally-warmed conditions. Seed from low-quality edge habitat had inferior emergence across sites, but high-elevation seeds were also locally adapted. High-elevation plants initiated flowering earlier than plants from lower populations, required less heat accumulation to mature seed, and so achieved higher lifetime fitness at high elevations. Fitness was strongly reduced above the range, but adaptive phenology enhanced the relative fitness of high-elevation seeds. Experimental warming improved fitness above the range, confirming climates importance in limiting R. minors distribution, but eliminated the advantage of local cold-edge populations. These results provide experimental support for recent models in which cold-adapted edge populations do not always facilitate warming-induced range shifts. The highest fitness above the range was achieved by a  super edge phenotype from a neighboring mountain, suggesting key adaptations exist at the regional scale even if absent from local edge populations. Our results demonstrate that assessing the value of edge populations will not be straightforward, but suggest that a regional approach to their conservation, potentially enhancing gene flow among them, might maximize species ability to respond to global change.\\n\\nSignificanceIndividuals from range-edge populations are the most likely to disperse to habitat beyond the species current range, but are they best suited to colonize it? Our multi-year transplant experiment throughout and above the elevational range of an annual herb in the Canadian Rocky Mountains found that adaptive flowering phenology enhanced the fitness of high-edge seeds above the range, outweighing detrimental effects of poor seed quality. However, only one edge population maintained its advantage over central populations under experimental warming. While edge populations were most likely to drive range expansion, adaptation to cold climates may not help them initiate range shifts in response to climate warming, unless superior genotypes spread among isolated edge populations.",

Low statistical power and endogenous measures of environment have been obstacles to the credible estimation of such gene-by-environment interactions. We overcome these obstacles by combining a natural experiment that generated variation in secondary education with polygenic scores for a quarter million individuals. The additional schooling affected body size, lung function, and blood pressure in middle age. The improvements in body size and lung function were larger for individuals with high genetic predisposition to obesity. As a result, education reduced the gap in unhealthy body size between those with high and low genetic risk of obesity from 20 to 6 percentage points.",

    "abstract": "For encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, asymptomatic carriage is more common and longer in duration than disease, and hence is often a more convenient endpoint for clinical trials of vaccines against these bacteria. However, using a carriage endpoint entails specific challenges. Carriage is almost always measured as prevalence, whereas the vaccine may act by reducing incidence or duration. Thus, to determine sample size requirements, its impact on prevalence must first be estimated. The relationship between incidence and prevalence (or duration and prevalence) is convex, saturating at 100% prevalence. For this reason, the proportional effect of a vaccine on prevalence is typically less than its proportional effect on incidence or duration. This relationship is further complicated in the presence of multiple pathogen strains. In addition, host immunity to carriage accumulates rapidly with frequent exposures in early years of life, creating potentially complex interactions with the vaccines effect. We conducted a simulation study to predict the impact of an inactivated whole cell pneumococcal vaccine--believed to reduce carriage duration--on carriage prevalence in different age groups and trial settings. We used an individual-based model of pneumococcal carriage that incorporates relevant immunological processes, both vaccine-induced and naturally acquired. Our simulations showed that for a wide range of vaccine efficacies, sampling time and age at vaccination are important determinants of sample size. There is a window of favorable sampling times during which the required sample size is relatively low, and this window is prolonged with a younger age at vaccination, and in a trial setting with lower transmission intensity. These results illustrate the ability of simulation studies to inform the planning of vaccine trials with carriage endpoints, and the methods we present here can be applied to trials evaluating other pneumococcal vaccine candidates or comparing alternative dosing schedules for the existing conjugate vaccines.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryStreptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterium carried in the nasopharynx of many healthy people, is also a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, and ear infections in children aged five years and younger. Vaccines targeting select strains of S. pneumoniae have been effective, and the development of new vaccines, particularly those that target all strains, can further lower disease burden. For clinical trials of these vaccines, the number of study participants needed depends on the expected effect of the vaccine on a conveniently measured outcome: asymptomatic carriage. The most economical way to test a vaccine for its effect on carriage is by measuring prevalence at a specific time, and comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated participants. The relationship between incidence (or duration) and prevalence is complex, and changes with time as children develop natural immunity. We explored this relationship using a mathematical model. Given a vaccine efficacy, our computer simulations predict that fewer study participants are needed if they are vaccinated at a younger age, taken from a population with intermediate levels of transmission, and sampled for carriage at a certain time window: 9 to 18 months after vaccination. Our study illustrates how simulation studies can help plan more efficient vaccine trials.",

    "abstract": "The magnitude of influenza epidemics is largely determined by the number of susceptible individuals at the start of the influenza season. Susceptibility, in turn, is influenced by antigenic drift. The evolution of influenzas B-cell epitopes has been charted thoroughly, and only recently evidence for T-cell driven evolution is accumulating. We investigate the relation between susceptibility to influenza, and antigenic drift at CD8+ T-cell epitopes over a 45-year timespan. We estimate age-specific susceptibility with data reported by general practitioners, using a disease-transmission model in a Bayesian framework. We find large variation in susceptibility, both between seasons and age classes. Although it is often assumed that antigenic drift drives the variation in susceptibility, we do not find evidence for a relation between drift and susceptibility in our data. This suggests that other factors determining the variation in susceptibility play a dominating role, or that complex influenza-infection histories obscure any direct effects.\\n\\nPreface to this bioR{chi}iv pre-printWe are currently in the process of making this manuscript ready for re-submission, and are resolving some issues brought forward by our referees. Most importantly, we aim to better incorporate the co-circulation of the various influenza A and B subtypes during the different seasons, both in the estimation of susceptibility and antigenic drift.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-specific network models of chemical-induced gene perturbation can improve our mechanistic understanding of the intracellular events leading to adverse health effects resulting from chemical exposure. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-inducible transcription factor (TF) that activates a battery of genes and produces a variety of species-specific adverse effects in response to the potent and persistent environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Here we assemble a global map of the AHR gene regulatory network in TCDD-treated mouse liver from a combination of previously published gene expression and genome-wide TF binding data sets. Using Kohonen selforganizing maps and subspace clustering, we show that genes co-regulated by common upstream TFs in the AHR network exhibit a pattern of co-expression. Specifically, directly-bound, indirectly-bound and non-genomic AHR target genes exhibit distinct patterns of gene expression, with the directly bound targets generally associated with highest median expression. Further, among the directly bound AHR target genes, the expression level increases with the number of AHR binding sites in the proximal promoter regions. Finally, we show that co-regulated genes in the AHR network activate distinct groups of downstream biological processes, with AHR-bound target genes enriched for metabolic processes and enrichment of immune responses among AHR-unbound target genes, likely reflecting infiltration of immune cells into the mouse liver upon TCDD treatment. This work describes an approach to the reconstruction and analysis of transcriptional regulatory cascades underlying cellular stress response using bioinformatic and statistical tools.",

In order to determine the strength of conditioning rats were given 14 consecutive days of 24-h access to CS+ and CS- flavors mixed only with 0.05% Kool-Aid and 0.05% saccharin (extinction), then further tested 34 days after the last extinction test (48 days post conditioning) for 2 consecutive days with the CS+ and CS-. We found that not only did the learned CFP fail to extinguish over 14 days of testing, but it also persisted for at least 48 days after conditioning. These data provide a method to produce a robust, long lasting and persistent CFP for use in future ingestive behavior research.",

    "abstract": "Humans are highly skilled at analysing complex acoustic scenes. The segregation of different acoustic streams and the formation of corresponding neural representations is mostly attributed to the auditory cortex. Decoding of selective attention from neuroimaging has therefore focussed on cortical responses to sound. However, the auditory brainstem response to speech is modulated by selective attention as well, as recently shown through measuring the brainstems response to running speech. Although the response of the auditory brainstem has a smaller magnitude than that of the auditory cortex, it occurs at much higher frequencies and therefore has a higher information rate. Here we develop statistical models for extracting the brainstem response from multi-channel scalp recordings and for analysing the attentional modulation according to the focus of attention. We demonstrate that the attentional modulation of the brainstem response to speech can be employed to decode the attentional focus of a listener from short measurements of ten seconds or less in duration. The decoding remains accurate when obtained from three EEG channels only. We further show how out-of-the-box decoding that employs subject-independent models, as well as decoding that is independent of the specific attended speaker is capable of achieving similar accuracy. These results open up new avenues for investigating the neural mechanisms for selective attention in the brainstem and for developing efficient auditory brain-computer interfaces.",

    "abstract": "The visual system can use conceptual information to search for targets even in the absence of clear featural signifiers1, and visual saccades are often directed at target objects defined by conceptual content2. These abilities are a core component of our facility with the visual world. Here, we evaluate whether contingent mechanisms of visual attention, known to trigger in response to target features such as motion, color or luminance3, are also triggered by visual patterns that match conceptually specified categories. These pre-registered experiments provide convergent behavioral and electrophysiological support that covert spatial attention is rapidly triggered by natural image exemplars from superordinate conceptually described target sets such as dinner food or four-legged animal, even when each target was viewed only once. In the behavioral experiment when two targets were presented with onsets separated by only 167ms, subjects reported the second target more often when it was in the same spatial location as the first. In the EEG experiment, images elicited clear N2pc and P3 components only when they matched the conceptually specified target set. The latency of the N2pc peaked at roughly 250ms, which is comparable to that commonly found in other N2pc studies for simpler stimulus types. These results suggest that vision quickly decodes conceptual information from natural images and selectively deploys spatial attention to locations containing information that matches current search goals.",

    "abstract": "Over an animals lifespan, neuronal circuits and systems often decline in an inherently heterogeneous fashion. To compare the age-dependent progression of changes in visual behavior with alterations in retinal physiology, we examined phototaxis and electroretinograms (ERGs) in a wild-type D. melanogaster strain (Canton-S) across their lifespan. In aged flies (beyond 50% median lifespan), we found a marked decline in phototaxis, while motor coordination was less disrupted, as indicated by relatively stronger negative geotaxis. These aged flies displayed substantially reduced ERG transient amplitudes while the receptor potentials (RP) remained largely intact. Using a repetitive light flash protocol, we serendipitously discovered two forms of activity-dependent oscillation in the ERG waveforms of young flies: \\\"light-off and \\\"light-on\\\" oscillations. After repeated 500 ms light flashes, light-off oscillations appeared during the ERG off-transients (frequency: 50-120 Hz, amplitude: ~1 mV). Light-on oscillations (100-200 Hz, ~0.3 mV) were induced by a series of 50 ms flashes, and were evident during the ERG on-transients. Both forms of oscillation were observed in other strains of D. melanogaster(Oregon-R, Berlin), additional Drosophila species (funerbris, euronotus, hydei, americana), and were evoked by a variety of light sources. Both light-off and light-on oscillations were distinct from previously described ERG oscillations in visual mutants, such as rosA, in terms of location within the waveform and frequency. However, within rosA mutants, light-off oscillations, but not light-on oscillations could be recruited by the repetitive light flash protocol. Importantly though, we found that both forms of oscillation were rarely observed in aged flies. Although the physiological bases of these oscillations remain to be elucidated, they may provide important clues to age-related changes in neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how proteins encode ligand specificity is fascinating and similar in importance to deciphering the genetic code. For protein-ligand recognition, the combination of an almost infinite variety of interfacial shapes and patterns of chemical groups makes the problem especially challenging. Here we analyze data across non-homologous proteins in complex with small biological ligands to address observations made in our inhibitor discovery projects: that proteins favor donating H-bonds to ligands and avoid using groups with both H-bond donor and acceptor capacity. The resulting clear and significant chemical group matching preferences elucidate the code for protein-native ligand binding, similar to the dominant patterns found in nucleic acid base-pairing. On average, 90% of the keto and carboxylate oxygens occurring in the biological ligands formed direct H-bonds to the protein. A two-fold preference was found for protein atoms to act as H-bond donors and ligand atoms to act as acceptors, and 76% of all intermolecular H-bonds involved an amine donor. Together, the tight chemical and geometric constraints associated with satisfying donor groups generate a hydrogen-bonding lock that can be matched only by ligands bearing the right acceptor-rich key. Measuring an index of H-bond preference based on the observed chemical trends proved sufficient to predict other protein-ligand complexes and can be used to guide molecular design. The resulting Hbind and Protein Recognition Index software packages are being made available for rigorously defining intermolecular H-bonds and measuring the extent to which H-bonding patterns in a given complex match the preference key.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "The concept of critical concentration (CC) is central to understanding behaviors of microtubules and other cytoskeletal polymers. Traditionally, these polymers are understood to have one CC, measured multiple ways and assumed to be the subunit concentration necessary for polymer assembly. However, this framework does not incorporate dynamic instability (DI), and there is work indicating that microtubules have two CCs. We use our previously established simulations to confirm that microtubules have (at least) two experimentally relevant CCs and to clarify the behaviors of individuals and populations relative to the CCs. At free subunit concentrations above the lower CC (CCIndGrow), growth phases of individual filaments can occur transiently; above the higher CC (CCPopGrow), the populations polymer mass will increase persistently. Our results demonstrate that most experimental CC measurements correspond to CCPopGrow, meaning \\\"typical\\\" DI occurs below the concentration traditionally considered necessary for polymer assembly. We report that [free tubulin] at steady state does not equal CCPopGrow, but instead approaches CCPopGrow asymptotically as [total tubulin] increases and depends on the number of stable microtubule seeds. We show that the degree of separation between CCIndGrow and CCPopGrow depends on the rate of nucleotide hydrolysis. This clarified framework helps explain and unify many experimental observations.",

    "abstract": "RNA splicing is a key mechanism linking genetic variation with psychiatric disorders. Splicing profiles are particularly diverse in brain and difficult to accurately identify and quantify. We developed a new approach to address this challenge, combining long-range PCR and nanopore sequencing with a novel bioinformatics pipeline. We identify the full-length coding transcripts of CACNA1C in human brain. CACNA1C is a psychiatric risk gene that encodes the voltage-gated calcium channel CaV1.2. We show that CACNA1Cs transcript profile is substantially more complex than appreciated, identifying 38 novel exons and 241 novel transcripts. Importantly, many of the novel variants are abundant, and predicted to encode channels with altered function. The splicing profile varies between brain regions, especially in cerebellum. We demonstrate that human transcript diversity (and thereby protein isoform diversity) remains under-characterised, and provide a feasible and cost-effective methodology to address this. A detailed understanding of isoform diversity will be essential for the translation of psychiatric genomic findings into pathophysiological insights and novel psychopharmacological targets.",

    "abstract": "Blood-borne factors regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) and cognition in mammals, albeit via mechanisms that are poorly understood. We report that elevating circulating unacylated-ghrelin (UAG), using both pharmacological and genetic methods, reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and plasticity in mice. Spatial memory impairments observed in GOAT-/- mice that lack acyl-ghrelin (AG) but have high levels of UAG, were rescued by treatment with AG. This unexpected finding suggests that the post-translational acylation of ghrelin is an important modulator of neurogenesis and memory in adult mammals. To determine whether this paradigm is relevant to humans we analysed circulating AG:UAG levels in Parkinsons disease (PD) patients diagnosed with dementia (PDD), cognitively intact PD patients and healthy controls. Uniquely, the ratio of plasma AG:UAG was reduced in the PDD cohort and correlated with cognitive performance. Our results identify UAG as a novel regulator of neurogenesis and cognition, and AG:UAG as a circulating diagnostic biomarker of dementia. The findings extend our understanding of adult brain plasticity regulation by circulating factors and suggest that manipulating the post-translational acylation of plasma ghrelin may offer therapeutic opportunities to ameliorate cognitive decline.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LICirculating UAG impairs markers of neurogenesis and plasticity\\nC_LIO_LIGOAT-/-mice have impaired neurogenesis and spatial memory\\nC_LIO_LICirculating acyl-ghrelin (AG) rescues spatial memory deficit in GOAT-/-mice\\nC_LIO_LICirculating AG:UAG ratio is reduced in Parkinsons disease dementia\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Isogenic cells living in the same environment show a natural heterogeneity associated with fluctuations in gene expression. When these fluctuations propagate through cellular regulatory networks, they can give rise to noise regulons, whereby multiple genes fluctuate in a coordinated fashion in single cells. The propagation of these fluctuations has been extensively characterized at the transcriptional level. For example, variations in transcription factor concentration induce correlated fluctuations in the abundance of target gene products. Here, we find that such noise regulons can also stem from protein degradation. We expressed pairs of yellow and red fluorescent proteins, subjected them to differential translation or degradation, and analyzed their fluctuations in single cells. While differential translation had little impact on fluctuations, protein degradation was found to be a dominant contributor. A mathematical model to decompose fluctuations arising from multiple sources of regulation revealed that cells with higher protein production capacity also exhibited higher protein degradation capacity. This association uncouples fluctuations in protein abundance from fluctuations in production rate, and can generate orthogonal noise regulons even for proteins relying on the same transcriptional program.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic pathway assembly typically involves the expression of enzymes from multiple organisms in a single heterologous host. Ensuring that each enzyme functions effectively can be challenging, since many potential factors can disrupt proper pathway flux. These challenges are amplified when the enzymes are expressed at single copy from the chromosome. We have explored these issues using 4-hydroxybenzoate monooxygenase homologs heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. Initial chromosomal enzyme expression was insufficient to support consistent growth with 4-hydroxybenzoate. Experimental evolution identified mutations that improved pathway activity. One set of mutations was common between homologs, while a second class of mutations was homolog-specific. Ultimately, we were able to identify a set of mutations that provided sufficient activity for growth with 4-hydroxybenzoate while maintaining or improving growth with protocatechuate. These findings demonstrate the potential for flexible, scalable chromosomal pathway engineering, as well as the value of directed evolution strategies to rapidly identify and overcome diverse factors limiting enzyme activity.",

    "abstract": "MotivationChlP-seq is used extensively to identify sites of transcription factor binding or regions of epigenetic modifications to the genome. A key step in ChIP-seq analysis is peak calling, where genomic regions enriched for ChIP versus control reads are identified. Many programs have been designed to solve this task, but nearly all fall into the statistical trap of using the data twice--once to determine candidate enriched regions, and again to assess enrichment by classical statistical hypothesis testing. This double use of the data invalidates the statistical significance assigned to enriched regions, and as a consequence, invalidates false discovery rate estimates. Thus, the true significance or reliability of peak calls remains unknown.\\n\\nResultsUsing simulated and real ChIP-seq data sets, we show that three well-known peak callers, MACS, SICER and diffReps, output optimistically biased p-values, and therefore optimistic false discovery rate estimates--in some cases, many orders of magnitude too optimistic. We propose a wrapper algorithm, RECAP, that uses resampling of ChIP-seq and control data to estimate and correct for biases built into peak calling algorithms. P-values recalibrated by RECAP are approximately uniformly distributed when applied to null hypothesis data, in which ChIP-seq and control come from the same genomic distributions. When applied to non-null data, RECAP p-values give a better estimate of the true statistical significance of candidate peaks and better false discovery rate estimates, which correlate better with empirical reproducibility. RECAP is a powerful new tool for assessing the true statistical significance of ChIP-seq peak calls.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe RECAP software is available on github at https://github.com/theodorejperkins/RECAP.\\n\\nContacttperkins@ohri.ca",

    "abstract": "Mineralized bone forms when collagen-containing osteoid accrues hydroxyapatite crystals. This process has two phases: a rapid initiation (primary mineralization), followed by slower accrual of mineral (secondary mineralization) that continues until that portion of bone is renewed by remodelling. Within the bone matrix is an interconnected network of cells termed osteocytes. These cells are derived from bone-forming osteoblasts. Osteoblast differentiation requires expression of ephrinB2, and we were intrigued about why ephrinB2 continues to be expressed in mature osteocytes. To determine its function in osteocytes, we developed an osteocyte-specific ephrinB2 null mouse and found they exhibited a brittle bone phenotype. This was not caused by a change in bone mass, but by an intrinsic defect in the strength of the bone material. Although the initiation of osteoid mineralization occurred at a normal rate, the process of secondary mineralization was accelerated in these mice. The maturing mineralized bone matrix incorporated mineral and carbonate more rapidly than controls, indicating that osteocytic ephrinB2 suppresses mineral accumulation in bone. No known regulators of mineralization were modified in the bone of these mice. However, RNA sequencing showed differential expression of a group of autophagy-associated genes, and increased autophagic flux was confirmed in ephrinB2 knockdown osteocytes. This indicates that the process of secondary mineralization in bone makes use of autophagic machinery in a manner that is limited by ephrinB2 in osteocytes, and that this process may be disrupted in conditions of bone fragility.",

    "abstract": "Archaeological and genetic evidence suggest that all domestic cats derive from the Near Eastern wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and were domesticated twice, first in the Near East around 10 000 years ago and for the second time in Ancient Egypt ca. 3 500 years ago. The spread of the domesticated form in Europe occurred much later, primarily mediated by Greek and Phoenician traders and afterwards by Romans who introduced cats to Western and Central Europe around 2 000 years ago. We investigated mtDNA of Holocene Felis remains and provide evidence of an unexpectedly early presence of cats bearing the Near Eastern wildcat mtDNA haplotypes in Central Europe, being ahead of Roman Period by over 2 000 years. The appearance of the Near Eastern wildcats in Central Europe coincide with the peak of Neolithic settlement density, moreover most of those cats belonged to the same mtDNA lineages as those domesticated in the Near East. Thus, although we cannot fully exclude that the Near Eastern wildcats appeared in Central Europe as a result of introgression with European wildcat, our findings strongly support the hypothesis that the Near Eastern wildcats spread across Europe together with the first farmers, perhaps as commensal animals. We also found that cats dated to the Neolithic period belonged to different mtDNA lineages than those brought to Central Europe in Roman times, this supports the hypothesis that the gene pool of contemporary European domestic cats might have been established from two different source populations that contributed in different periods.",

    "abstract": "Carboxy-terminal processing proteases (CTPs) occur in all three domains of life. In bacteria some of them have been associated with virulence. However, the precise roles of bacterial CTPs are poorly understood and few direct proteolytic substrates have been identified. One bacterial CTP is the CtpA protease of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is required for type III secretion system function, and for virulence in a mouse model of acute pneumonia. Here, we have investigated the function of CtpA in P. aeruginosa and identified some of the proteins it cleaves. We discovered that CtpA forms a complex with a previously uncharacterized protein, which we have named LbcA (lipoprotein binding partner of CtpA). LbcA is required for CtpA activity in vivo and promotes its activity in vitro. We have also identified four proteolytic substrates of CtpA, all of which are uncharacterized proteins predicted to cleave the peptide cross-links within peptidoglycan. Consistent with this, a ctpA null mutant was found to have fewer peptidoglycan cross-links than the wild type and grew slowly in salt-free medium. Intriguingly, the accumulation of just one of the CtpA substrates was required for some {Delta}ctpA mutant phenotypes, including the defective T3SS. We propose that LbcA*CtpA is a proteolytic complex in the P. aeruginosa cell envelope, which controls the activity of several peptidoglycan cross-link hydrolases by degrading them. Furthermore, based on these and other findings we suggest that many bacterial CTPs might be similarly controlled by partner proteins as part of a widespread mechanism to control peptidoglycan hydrolase activity.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBacterial carboxy-terminal processing proteases (CTPs) are widely conserved and have been associated with the virulence of several species. However, their roles are poorly understood and few direct substrates have been identified in any species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important human pathogen in which one CTP, known as CtpA, is required for type III secretion system function, and for virulence. This work provides an important advance by showing that CtpA works with a previously uncharacterized binding partner to degrade four substrates. These substrates are all predicted to hydrolyze peptidoglycan cross-links, suggesting that the CtpA complex is an important control mechanism for peptidoglycan hydrolysis. This is likely to emerge as a widespread mechanism used by diverse bacteria to control some of their peptidoglycan hydrolases. This is significant, given the links between CTPs and virulence in several pathogens, and the importance of peptidoglycan remodeling to almost all bacterial cells.",

    "abstract": "The peptidoglycan cell wall provides an essential protective barrier in almost all bacteria, defining cellular morphology and conferring resistance to osmotic stress and other environmental hazards. The precursor to peptidoglycan, lipid II, is assembled on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. However, peptidoglycan polymerization occurs on the outer face of the plasma membrane, and lipid II must be flipped across the membrane by the MurJ protein prior to its use in peptidoglycan synthesis. Due to its central role in cell wall assembly, MurJ is of fundamental importance in microbial cell biology and is a prime target for novel antibiotic development. However, relatively little is known regarding the mechanisms of MurJ function, and structural data are only available for MurJ from the extremophile Thermosipho africanus. Here, we report the crystal structure of substrate-free MurJ from the Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli, revealing an inward-open conformation. Taking advantage of the genetic tractability of E. coli, we performed high-throughput mutagenesis and next-generation sequencing to assess mutational tolerance at every amino acid in the protein, providing a detailed functional and structural map for the enzyme and identifying sites for inhibitor development. Finally, through the use of sequence co-evolution analysis we identify functionally important interactions in the outward-open state of the protein, supporting a rocker-switch model for lipid II transport.",

    "abstract": "Photoactivatable ( caged) pharmacological agents have revolutionized neuroscience but the palette of available ligands is limited. We describe a general method for caging tertiary amines using an unconventional quaternary ammonium linkage that is chemically stable and elicits a desirable red-shift in activation wavelength. A photoactivatable nicotine (PA-Nic) prepared using this strategy could be uncaged via 1- or 2-photon excitation, making it useful for optopharmacology experiments to study nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in different experimental preparations and spatiotemporal scales.",
