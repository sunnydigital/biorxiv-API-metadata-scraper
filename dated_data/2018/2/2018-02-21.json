    "abstract": "BackgroundEmerging adulthood is a peak period of risk for alcohol and illicit drug use. Recent advances in psychiatric genetics suggest that the co-occurrence of substance use and psychopathology arises, in part, from a shared genetic etiology. We sought to extend this research by investigating the influence of genetic risk for schizophrenia on trajectories of four substance use behaviors as they occurred across emerging adulthood.\\n\\nMethodYoung adult participants of non-Hispanic European descent provided DNA samples and completed daily reports of substance use for one month per year across four years (N=30,085 observations of N=342 participants). Polygenic scores for schizophrenia were included in two-level hierarchical linear models designed to test associations between genetic risk for schizophrenia, participant age, and four substance use phenotypes.\\n\\nResultsHere, we interpret results at p<.05 as suggestive and results at p<.005 as significant. Accordingly, our results suggest that polygenic scores for schizophrenia were positively associated with participants overall likelihood to engage in illicit drug use, but not alcohol-related substance use. Moreover, our results indicate that participants with a greater polygenic loading for schizophrenia experienced greater age-related increases in the likelihood of using substances across emerging adulthood.\\n\\nConclusionsThe present study used a novel combination of polygenic prediction and intensive longitudinal methods to characterize the influence of genetic risk for schizophrenia on patterns of age-related change in substance use across emerging adulthood. Results suggest that genetic risk for schizophrenia exerts both broad and developmentally-specific influences on substance use behaviors in a non-clinical population of young adults.",

    "abstract": "There is a severe limitation in the number of items that can be held in working memory. However, the neurophysiological limits remain unknown. We asked whether the capacity limit might be explained by differences in neuronal coupling. We developed a theoretical model based on Predictive Coding and used it to analyze Cross Spectral Density data from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), frontal eye fields (FEF) and lateral intraparietal area (LIP). Monkeys performed a change detection task (Buschman et al., 2011). The number of objects that had to be remembered (memory load) was varied (1-3 objects in the same visual hemifield). Changes in memory load changed the connectivity in the PFC-FEF-LIP network. Feedback (top-down) coupling broke down when the number of objects exceeded cognitive capacity. This provides new insights into the neuronal underpinnings of cognitive capacity and how coupling in a distributed working memory network is affected by memory load.",

    "abstract": "Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) have emerged as a popular means for understanding noncoding variation in a variety of conditions. While a large number of experiments have been described in the literature, analysis typically uses ad-hoc methods. There has been little attention to comparing performance of methods across datasets.\n\nWe present the mpralm method which we show is calibrated and powerful, by analyzing its performance on multiple MPRA datasets. We show that it outperforms existing statistical methods for analysis of this data type, in the first comprehensive evaluation of statistical methods on several datasets. We investigate theoretical and real-data properties of barcode summarization methods and show an unappreciated impact of summarization method for some datasets. Finally, we use our model to conduct a power analysis for this assay and show substantial improvements in power by performing up to 6 replicates per condition, whereas sequencing depth has smaller impact; we recommend to always use at least 4 replicates. Together, these results inform recommendations for differential analysis, general group comparisons, and power analysis and will help improve design and analysis of MPRA experiments.

We have addressed the open question of how ECM stiffness might alter the susceptibility of host cells to infection by bacterial pathogens. We manufactured hydrogels of varying physiologically-relevant stiffness and seeded human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) on them. We then infected HMEC-1 with the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) and found that adhesion of Lm onto host cells increases monotonically with increasing matrix stiffness, an effect that requires the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified cell surface vimentin as a candidate surface receptor mediating stiffness-dependent adhesion of Lm to HMEC-1, and demonstrated that bacterial infection of these host cells is decreased when surface vimentin is perturbed. Our results provide the first evidence that ECM stiffness can mediate the susceptibility of host cells to bacterial infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe model species Arabidopsis thaliana has extensive resources to investigate intraspecific trait variability and the genetic bases of ecologically relevant traits. However, the cost of equipment and software required for high-throughput phenotyping is often a bottleneck for large-scale studies, such as mutant screening or quantitative genetics analyses. Simple tools are needed for the measurement of fitness-related traits, like relative growth rate and fruit production, without investment in expensive infrastructures. Here, we describe methods that enable the estimation of biomass accumulation and fruit number from the analysis of rosette and inflorescence images taken with a regular camera.\\n\\nResultsWe developed two models to predict plant dry mass and fruit number from the parameters extracted with the analysis of rosette and inflorescence images. Predictive models were trained by sacrificing growing individuals for dry mass estimation, and manually measuring a fraction of individuals for fruit number at maturity. Using a cross-validation approach, we showed that quantitative parameters extracted from image analysis predicts more 90% of both plant dry mass and fruit number. When used on 451 natural accessions, the method allowed modelling growth dynamics, including relative growth rate, throughout the life cycle of various ecotypes. Estimated growth-related traits had high heritability (0.65 < H2 < 0.93), as well as estimated fruit number (H2 = 0.68). In addition, we validated the method for estimating fruit number with rev5, a mutant with increased flower abortion.\\n\\nConclusionsThe method we propose here is based on the automated computerization of plant images with ImageJ, and subsequent statistical modelling in R. It allows plant biologists to measure growth dynamics and fruit number in hundreds of individuals with simple computing steps that can be repeated and adjusted to a wide range of laboratory conditions. It is thus a flexible toolkit for the measurement of fitness-related traits in large plant populations.",

    "abstract": "Arthropod vectors have multiple physical and immunological barriers that impede the development and transmission of parasites to new vertebrate hosts. These barriers include the peritrophic matrix (PM), a chitinous barrier that separates the blood bolus from the midgut epithelia and inturn, modulates vector-microbiota interactions. In tsetse flies, a sleeve-like PM is continuously produced by the cardia organ located at the fore- and midgut junction. African trypanosomes, Trypanosoma brucei, must bypass the PM twice; first to colonize the midgut and secondly to reach the salivary glands (SG), to complete their transmission cycle in tsetse. However, not all flies with midgut infections develop mammalian transmissible SG infections - the reasons for which are unclear. Here, we used transcriptomics, microscopy and functional genomics analyses to understand the factors that regulate parasite migration from midgut to SG. In flies with midgut infections only, parasites fail to cross the PM as they are eliminated from the cardia by reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) - albeit at the expense of collateral cytotoxic damage to the cardia. In flies with midgut and SG infections, expression of genes encoding components of the PM is reduced in the cardia, and structural integrity of the PM barrier is compromised. Under these circumstances trypanosomes traverse through the newly secreted and compromised PM. The process of PM attrition that enables the parasites to re-enter into the midgut lumen is apparently mediated by components of the parasites residing in the cardia. Thus, a fine-tuned dialogue between tsetse and trypanosomes at the cardia determines the outcome of PM integrity and trypanosome transmission success.\\n\\nAuthor summaryInsects are responsible for transmission of parasites that cause deadly diseases in humans and animals. Understanding the key factors that enhance or interfere with parasite transmission processes can result in new control strategies. Here, we report that a proportion of tsetse flies with African trypanosome infections in their midgut can prevent parasites from migrating to the salivary glands, albeit at the expense of collateral damage. In a subset of flies with gut infections, the parasites manipulate the integrity of a midgut barrier, called the peritrophic matrix, and reach the salivary glands for transmission to the next mammal. Either targeting parasite manipulative processes or enhancing peritrophic matrix integrity could reduce parasite transmission.",

    "abstract": "A structural characterization of the interaction between T cell receptors (TCR) and cognate peptide-MHC (pMHC) is central to understanding adaptive T cell mediated immunity. X-ray crystallography, although the source of much structural data, traditionally provides only a static snapshot of the protein. Given the emerging evidence for the important role of conformational dynamics in protein function, we interrogated 309 crystallographic structures of pMHC complexes using ensemble refinement, a technique that can extract dynamic information from the X-ray data. We found that in a large number of systems ensemble methods were able to uncover previously hidden evidence of significant conformational plasticity, thereby revealing additional information that can build upon and significantly enhance functional interpretations that are based on a single static structure. Notable examples include the interpretation of differences in the disease association of HLA subtypes, the relationship between peptide prominence and TCR recognition, the role of conformational flexibility in vaccine design, and discriminating between induced fit and conformational selection models of TCR binding. We show that the currently widespread practise of analyzing pMHC interactions via the study of a single crystallographic structure does not make use of pertinent and easily accessible information from X-ray data concerning alternative protein conformations. This new analysis therefore not only highlights the capacity for ensemble methods to significantly enrich the interpretation of decades of structural data, but also provides previously missing information concerning the dynamics of existing characterized TCR-pMHC interactions.",

However, little is known about how such dynamic recruitment patterns intracellular signaling and cellular development. Here, we combined transcriptional profiling, reaction-diffusion modeling, and single-molecule tracking to study signal exchange in and out of a microdomain at the cell pole of the asymmetrically dividing bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Our study revealed that the microdomain is selectively permeable, and that each protein in the signaling pathway that activates the cell fate transcription factor CtrA is sequestered and uniformly concentrated within the microdomain or its proximal membrane. Restricted rates of entry into and escape from the microdomain enhance phospho-signaling, leading to a sublinear gradient of CtrA~P along the long axis of the cell. The spatial patterning of CtrA~P creates a gradient of transcriptional activation that serves to prime asymmetric development of the two daughter cells.",

    "abstract": "The ability to predict how multiple traits interact in determining performance is key to understanding the evolution of complex functional systems. Similar to Simpsons adaptive landscape, which describes the fitness consequences of varying morphological traits, performance landscapes depict the performance consequences of varying morphological traits. Mapping the populations location with respect to the topographic features of the landscape could inform us on the selective forces operating on the traits that underlie performance. Here, we used a mechanistic model derived from first principles of hydrodynamics to construct a hypothetical performance landscape for zooplankton prey capture using suction feeding. We then used the landscape to test whether a population of Chromis viridis, a coral reef zooplanktivore, is located on a performance peak or ridge based on measurements of kinematic variables recorded in-situ during undisturbed foraging. Observed trait combinations in the wild population closely matched regions of high feeding performance in the landscape, however the population was not located on a local performance peak. This sub-optimal performance was not due to constraints stemming from the observed trait correlations. The predominant directions of variation of the phenotypic traits was tangent to the  path of steepest ascent that points towards the local peak, indicating that the population does not reside on a \\\"performance ridge\\\". Rather, our analysis suggests that feeding performance is constrained by stabilizing selection, possibly reflecting a balance between selection on feeding performance and mechanical or genetic constraints.",

Cultured neuronal networks monitored with MEAs are now being widely used to characterize in vitro models of neurological disorders and to evaluate pharmaceutical compounds. meaRtools provides core algorithms for MEA spike train analysis, feature extraction, statistical analysis and plotting of multiple MEA recordings with multiple genotypes and treatments. meaRtools functionality covers novel solutions for spike train analysis, including algorithms to assess electrode cross-correlation using the spike train tiling coefficient (STTC), mutual information, synchronized bursts and entropy within cultured wells. Also integrated is a solution to account for bursts variability originating from mixed-cell neuronal cultures. The package provides a statistical platform built specifically for MEA data that can combine multiple MEA recordings and compare extracted features between different genetic models or treatments. We demonstrate the utilization of meaRtools to successfully identify epilepsy-like phenotypes in neuronal networks from Celf4 knockout mice. The package is freely available under the GPL license (GPL>=3) and is updated frequently on the CRAN web-server repository. The package, along with full documentation can be downloaded from: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meaRtools/.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCultured neuronal networks are widely used to study and characterize neuronal network activity. Among the many uses of neuronal cultures are the capabilities to evaluate neurotoxicity and the effects of pharmacological compounds on cellular physiology. Multi-well microelectrode arrays (MEAs) can collect high-throughput data from multiple neuronal cultures simultaneously, and thereby make possible hypotheses-driven inquiries into neurobiology and neuropharmacology. The analysis of MEA-derived information presents many computational challenges. High frequency data recorded simultaneously from hundreds of electrodes can be difficult to handle. The need to compare network activity across various drug treatments or genotypes recorded on the same plate from experiments lasting several weeks presents another challenge. These challenges inspired us to develop meaRtools; an MEA data analysis package that contains new methods to characterize network activity patterns, which are illustrated here using examples from a genetic mouse model of epilepsy. Among the highlights of meaRtools are novel algorithms designed to characterize neuronal activity dynamics and network properties such as bursting and synchronization, options to combine multiple recordings and use a robust statistical framework to draw appropriate statistical inferences, and finally data visualizations and plots. In summary, meaRtools provides a platform for the analyses of singular and longitudinal MEA experiments.",

    "abstract": "Detection of viruses in the environment is heavily dependent on PCR-based approaches that require reference sequences for primer design. While this strategy can accurately detect known viruses, it will not find novel genotypes, nor emerging and invasive viral species. In this study, we investigated the use of viromics, i.e. high-throughput sequencing of the biosphere viral fraction, to detect human/animal pathogenic RNA viruses in the Conwy river catchment area in Wales, UK. Using a combination of filtering and nuclease treatment, we extracted the viral fraction from wastewater, estuarine river water and sediment, followed by RNASeq analysis on the Illumina HiSeq platform for the discovery of RNA virus genomes. We found a higher richness of RNA viruses in wastewater samples than in river water and sediment, and assembled a complete norovirus GI.2 genome from wastewater effluent, which was not contemporaneously detected by conventional qRT-PCR. To our knowledge, this is the first environmentally-derived norovirus genome sequence to be available from a public database. The simultaneous presence of diverse rotavirus signatures in wastewater indicated the potential for zoonotic infections in the area and suggested run-off from pig farms as a possible origin of these viruses. Our results show that viromics can be an important tool in the discovery of pathogenic viruses in the environment and can be used to inform and optimize reference-based detection methods provided appropriate and rigorous controls are included.\\n\\nImportanceEnteric viruses cause gastro-intestinal illness and are commonly transmitted through the faecal-oral route. When wastewater is released into river systems, these viruses can contaminate the environment. Our results show that we can use viromics to find the range of potentially pathogenic viruses that are present in the environment and identify prevalent genotypes. The ultimate goal is to trace the fate of these pathogenic viruses from origin to the point where they are a threat to human health, informing reference-based detection methods and water quality management.",

    "abstract": "The 99 amino acid C-terminal fragment of Amyloid Precursor Protein APP-C99 (C99) is cleaved by {gamma}-secretase to form A{beta} peptide, which plays a critical role in the etiology of Alzheimers Disease (AD). The structure of C99 consists of a single transmembrane domain flanked by intra and intercellular domains. While the structure of the transmembrane domain has been well characterized, little is known about the structure of the flanking domains and their role in C99 processing by {gamma}-secretase. To gain insight into the structure of full-length C99, REMD simulations were performed for monomeric C99 in model membranes of varying thickness. We find equilibrium ensembles of C99 from simulation agree with experimentally-inferred residue insertion depths and protein backbone chemical shifts. In thin membranes, the transmembrane domain structure is correlated with extra-membrane structural states. Mean and variance of the transmembrane and G37G38 hinge angles are found to increase with thinning membrane. The N-terminus of C99 forms {beta}-strands that may seed aggregation of A{beta} on the membrane surface, promoting amyloid formation. The N-terminus, which forms -helices that interact with the nicastrin domain of {gamma}-secretase. The C-terminus of C99 becomes more -helical as the membrane thickens, forming structures that may be suitable for binding by cytoplasmic proteins, while C-terminal residues essential to cytotoxic function become -helical as the membrane thins. The heterogeneous but discrete extra-membrane domain states analyzed here open the path to new investigations of the role of C99 structure and membrane in amyloidogenesis.",

Data-driven methods can estimate long-term trends from cross-sectional data while adjusting for variability in baseline ability, which complicates dementia assessment in those with DS.\\n\\nMethodsWe applied an event-based model to cognitive test data and informant-rated questionnaire data from 283 adults with DS (the largest study of cognitive functioning in DS to date) to estimate the sequence of cognitive decline and individuals disease stage.\\n\\nResultsDecline in tests of memory, sustained attention / motor coordination, and verbal fluency occurred early, demonstrating that AD in DS follows a similar pattern of change to other forms of AD. Later decline was found for informant measures. Using the resulting staging model, we showed that adults with a clinical diagnosis of dementia and those with APOE 3:4 or 4:4 genotype were significantly more likely to be staged later, suggesting the model is valid.\\n\\nInterpretationOur results identify tests of memory and sustained attention may be particularly useful measures to track decline in the preclinical/prodromal stages of AD in DS whereas informant-measures may be useful in later stages (i.e. during conversion to dementia, or post-diagnosis). These results have implications for the selection of outcome measures of treatment trials to delay or prevent cognitive decline due to AD in DS. As clinical diagnoses are generally made late into AD progression, early assessment is essential.",

    "abstract": "How diverse adult stem and progenitor populations regenerate tissue following damage to the CNS remains unknown across most neurogenic domains. To understand the role of quiescent radial-glial (qRG) stem cells during regeneration, we tested the hypothesis that qRG could be induced to proliferate and produce newborn neurons. We designed a stab lesion assay in the midbrain tectum of the adult zebrafish to target an isolated population of qRG, and investigated their proliferative behaviour, differentiation potential, and requirement of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling for the regenerative response. EdU-labelling showed that a small proportion of qRG transit to a proliferative state (pRG), but that progeny of pRG are restricted to a radial-glial fate. Lesion promoted upregulation of proliferation and neurogenesis from neuro-epithelial-like amplifying progenitors (NE-Ap) of the tectal marginal zone (TMZ). Homeostatic levels of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling persisted under lesioned conditions in the qRG/pRG population, whereby increased {beta}-catenin staining and axin2 expression was present in the NE-Ap progenitor zone. Attenuation of Wnt signalling using Dickkopf-1, demonstrated that proliferative responses post-injury appeared to be Wnt-independent. Our results align with the emerging view that adult stem/progenitor phenotypes are characterized by discrete, rather than mutual, regenerative programs and that different stem cell domains employ different modes of regeneration.",

A handful of loci have been associated with GSD in populations of predominantly European ancestry, however they only explain a small portion of the population-attributable risk of the disease.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for GSD in 1,095 admixed Latinos with Mapuche Native American Ancestry, followed by a replication analysis of 10 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with suggestive genome-wide significance (P<1x10-5) in 1,643 individuals. Disease status was assessed by cholecystectomy or abdominal ultrasonography. Logistic regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, Type 2 Diabetes and Amerindian ancestry. Associated variants were further examined in two large GSD European populations and in a Chilean gallbladder cancer (GBC) cohort. We determined the expression levels of a novel GSD-candidate gene in normal and GSD-tissue samples.\\n\\nResultsWe consistently replicated the ABCG8 gene (rs11887534; P=3.24x10-8, OR=1.74) associated with GSD in admixed Latinos and identified a novel candidate signal within the TRAF3 gene on chromosome 14 (rs12882491; P=1.11x10-7, OR=1.40). ABCG8 and TRAF3 variants also conferred risk to GBC. Gene expression analyses indicated that TRAF3 levels were significantly decreased in the gallbladder (P=0.015) and the duodenal mucosa (P=0.001) of affected GSD individuals compared to healthy controls.\\n\\nConclusionsWe confirmed ABCG8 and identified TRAF3 both associated with GSD and GBC in admixed Latinos.

    "abstract": "The functional equivalence between mental images and perception or motion has been proposed on the basis of neuroimaging evidence of large spatially overlapping activations between real and imagined sensori-motor conditions. However, similar local activation patterns do not imply the same mesoscopic integration of brain regions active during imagery and perception or action. Here we present the first EEG evidence of topological equivalence between functional network organization at intermediate and global scales during tasks. We show that the degree of functional equivalence varies in the population and is associated with different magnitudes in the restructuring of the functional connectivity between imagery and real tasks. In particular, changes observed during imagery with respect to basal conditions account for the cognitive effort experienced during imagery, and subjects characterized by stronger functional equivalence exhibit smaller topological deviations in the imagination tasks performed after real tasks, thus showing learning effects. Altogether, our findings point to different sensori-cognitive information processing in the subjects showing different functional equivalence. We anticipate our results to be a starting point for a novel dynamical description of functional equivalence, which will be relevant for socio-cognitive theories of embodiment and cognitive formulations of how different selves emerge from neurophysiological assets.",

    "abstract": "piRNA-mediated repression of transposable elements (TE) in the germline limits the accumulation of heritable mutations caused by their transposition in the genome. It is not clear whether the piRNA pathway plays a functional role in adult, non-gonadal tissues in Drosophila melanogaster. To address this question, we first analyzed the small RNA content of adult Drosophila melanogaster heads. We found that varying amount of piRNA-sized, ping-pong positive molecules in heads correlates with contamination by gonadal tissue during RNA extraction, suggesting that most of piRNAs detected in head sequencing libraries originate from gonads. We next sequenced the heads of wild type and piwi mutants to address whether piwi loss of function would affect the low amount of piRNA-sized, ping-pong negative molecules that are still detected in heads hand-checked to avoid gonadal contamination. We find that loss of piwi does not affect significantly these 24-28 RNA molecules. Instead, we observe increased siRNA levels against the majority of Drosophila transposable element families. To determine the effect of this siRNA level change on transposon expression, we sequenced the transcriptome of wild type, piwi, dicer-2 and piwi, dicer-2 double-mutant fly heads. We find that RNA expression levels of the majority of TE families in piwi or dicer-2 mutants remain unchanged and that TE transcript abundance increases significantly only in piwi, dicer-2 double-mutants. These results lead us to suggest a dual-layer model for TE repression in adult somatic tissues. Piwi-mediated transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) established during embryogenesis constitutes the first layer of TE repression whereas Dicer-2-dependent siRNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) provide a backup mechanism to repress TEs that escape silencing by piwi-mediated TGS.",

    "abstract": "The vascular system is lined with endothelial cells that, although only existing in a single monolayer, are key in the regulation of vascular barrier function. One of the major challenges these cells face is a routine exposure to environmental stressors that can induce apoptosis. Uncontrolled apoptosis in the endothelial monolayer threatens the ability of the cells to maintain their barrier function, resulting in vascular dysfunction. Therefore, we sought to identify ways in which endothelia maintain a cohesive monolayer during apoptotic events. We found that endothelial cells fated die will undergo a process of apoptotic cellular extrusion, similar to what has been described in the epithelium. We further show that endothelial extrusion uses a conserved S1P-S1PR2-RhoA signaling pathway in order to induce the formation of an actin ring that contracts closed, forcing the dying cell out of the monolayer while simultaneously filling in the gap left behind. Thus, endothelial extrusion successfully removes an apoptotic cell before it compromises the monolayer, preserving the barrier function.",

    "abstract": "Late-segregating acentric chromosomes pose a serious risk to genomic integrity when they are excluded from dividing daughter nuclei and form damage-prone micronuclei. Insight into the cellular mechanisms that prevent the formation of micronuclei from acentrics come from studies demonstrating that acentrics reincorporate into daughter telophase nuclei by passing through Aurora B kinase-dependent channels in the nuclear envelope of Drosophila neuroblasts. Here, we uncover a mechanism of nuclear envelope channel formation in which localized concentrations of Aurora B preferentially phosphorylate H3(S10) on heterochromatic acentrics and their associated DNA tethers. This phosphorylation event prevents HP1a from associating with heterochromatin and results in localized inhibition of nuclear envelope reassembly on endonuclease- and X-irradiation-induced acentrics and the main daughter nuclei at the sites of acentric entry to promote the formation of channels. Finally, we find that HP1a also specifies initiation sites of nuclear envelope reassembly on undamaged chromatin. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Aurora B-mediated regulation of HP1a-chromatin interactions plays a key role maintaining genome integrity by locally preventing nuclear envelope assembly and facilitating incorporation of late-segregating acentrics into daughter nuclei.",

    "abstract": "Cell-specific patterns of gene expression are determined by combinatorial actions of sequence-specific transcription factors at cis-regulatory elements. Studies indicate that relatively simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors (LDTFs) play dominant roles in the selection of enhancers that establish cell identities and functions. LDTFs require collaborative interactions with additional transcription factors to mediate enhancer function, but the identities of these factors are often unknown. We have shown that natural genetic variation between individuals has great utility for discovering collaborative transcription factors. Here, we introduce MARGE (Mutation Analysis of Regulatory Genomic Elements), the first publicly available suite of software tools that integrates genome-wide genetic variation with epigenetic data to identify collaborative transcription factor pairs. MARGE is optimized to work with chromatin accessibility assays (such as ATAC-seq or DNase I hypersensitivity), as well as transcription factor binding data collected by ChlP-seq. Herein, we provide investigators with rationale for each step in the MARGE pipeline and key differences for analysis of datasets with different experimental designs. We demonstrate the utility of MARGE using mouse peritoneal macrophages, liver cells, and human lymphoblastoid cells. MARGE provides a powerful tool to identify combinations of cell type-specific transcription factors while simultaneously interpreting functional effects of non-coding genetic variation.",

In four studies, three different designs and an additional pre-registered replication of one sample, we found that spacing of cue-approach training induced a shift in food choice preferences over one month. The spacing and massing schedule employed governed the long-term changes in choice behavior.

However, the identification and characterization of complex individual ubiquitination cascades and their modulators remains a challenge. Here, we report a broadly applicable, multiplexed, miniaturized on-bead technique for real-time monitoring of various ubiquitination-related enzymatic activities. The assay, termed UPS-confocal fluorescence nanoscanning (UPS-CONA), employs a substrate of interest immobilized on a micro-bead and a fluorescently labelled ubiquitin which, upon enzymatic conjugation to the substrate, is quantitatively detected on the bead periphery by confocal imaging. UPS-CONA is suitable for studying individual enzymatic activities, including various E1, E2 and HECT-type E3 enzymes, and for monitoring multi-step reactions within ubiquitination cascades in a single experimental compartment. We demonstrate the power of the UPS-CONA technique by simultaneously following ubiquitin transfer from Ube1 through Ube2L3 to E6AP. We applied this multi-step setup to investigate the selectivity of five ubiquitination inhibitors reportedly targeting different classes of ubiquitination enzymes. Using UPS-CONA, we have identified a new activity of a small molecule E2 inhibitor, BAY 11-7082, and of a HECT E3 inhibitor, heclin, towards the Ube1 enzyme. As a sensitive, quantitative, flexible and reagent-efficient method with a straightforward protocol, UPS-CONA constitutes a powerful tool for interrogation of ubiquitination-related enzymatic pathways and their chemical modulators, and is readily scalable for large experiments.",

    "abstract": "Combined optogenetic stimulation and optical imaging permits scalable, high-throughput probing of cellular electrophysiology and optimization of stem-cell derived excitable cells, such as neurons and muscle cells. We report a new \\\"on-axis\\\" configuration of OptoDyCE, our all-optical platform for studying human induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and other cell types, optically driven by Channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2). This solid-state system integrates optogenetic stimulation with temporally-multiplexed simultaneous recording of membrane voltage (Vm) and intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) dynamics using a single photodetector. We demonstrate the capacity for combining multiple spectrally-compatible actuators and sensors, including newer high-performance near-infrared (NIR) voltage probes BeRST1 and Di-4-ANBDQBS, to record complex spatiotemporal responses of hiPSC-CMs to drugs in a high-throughput manner.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical environment can influence cell behaviour, including changes to transcriptional and proteomic regulation, morphology and, in the case of stem cells, commitment to lineage. However, current tools for characterizing substrates mechanical properties, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), often do not fully recapitulate the length and time scales over which cells  feel substrates. Here, we show that an immortalised, clonal line of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) maintained responsiveness to substrate mechanics observed in primary cells, and could be used as a reporter of stiffness. MSCs were cultured on soft and stiff polyacrylamide hydrogels. In both primary and immortalised MSCs, stiffer substrates promoted increased cell spreading, expression of lamin-A/C and translocation of mechano-sensitive proteins YAP1 and MKL1 to the nucleus. Stiffness was also found to regulate transcriptional markers of lineage. A GFP-YAP / RFP-H2B reporter construct was designed and virally delivered to the immortalised MSCs for in situ detection of substrate stiffness. MSCs with stable expression of the reporter showed GFP-YAP to be increasingly co-localized with nuclear RFP-H2B on stiffer substrates, enabling development of a cellular reporter of substrate stiffness. This will facilitate mechanical characterisation of new materials developed for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Protein sequence matching does not properly account for some well-known features of protein structures: surface residues being more variable than core residues, the high packing densities in globular proteins, and does not yield good matches of sequences of many proteins known to be close structural relatives. There are now abundant protein sequences and structures to enable major improvements to sequence matching. Here, we utilize structural frameworks to mount the observed correlated sequences to identify the most important correlated parts. The rationale is that protein structures provide the important physical framework for improving sequence matching. Combining the sequence and structure data in this way leads to a simple amino acid substitution matrix that can be readily incorporated into any sequence matching. This enables the incorporation of allosteric information into sequence matching and transforms it effectively from a 1-D to a 3-D procedure. The results from testing in over 3,000 sequence matches demonstrate a 37% gain in sequence similarity and a loss of 26% of the gaps when compared with the use of BLOSUM62. And, importantly there are major gains in the specificity of sequence matching across diverse proteins. Specifically, all known cases where protein structures match but sequences do not match well are resolved.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism by which familial Alzheimers disease (FAD) mutations within the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) affect [a]-endoproteolysis is only poorly understood. Thereby, mutations in the cleavage domain reduce [a]-efficiency of a-secretase cleavage and some even shift entry into production lines. Since cleavage occurs within the TMD, a relationship between processing and TMD structure and dynamics seems obvious. Using molecular dynamic simulations, we dissect the dynamic features of wild type and seven FAD-mutants into local and global components. Mutations consistently enhance hydrogen8 bond fluctuations upstream of the [a]-cleavage sites but maintain strong helicity there. Dynamic perturbation response scanning reveals that FAD-mutants target backbone motions utilized in the bound state. Those motions, obscured by large-scale motions in the pre-bound state, provide (i) a dynamic mechanism underlying the proposedcoupling between binding and [a]-cleavage, (ii) key sites consistent with experimentally determined docking sites, and (iii) the distinction between mutants and wild-type.",

    "abstract": "Of the four separate PE biosynthetic pathways in eukaryotes, one occurs in the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) and is executed by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (Psd1p). Deletion of Psd1, which is lethal in mice, compromises mitochondrial function. We hypothesize that this reflects inefficient import of non-mitochondrial PE into the IM. To test this, we re-wired PE metabolism in yeast by re-directing Psd1p to the outer mitochondrial membrane or the endomembrane system. Our biochemical and functional analyses identified the IMS as the greatest barrier for PE import and demonstrated that PE synthesis in the IM is critical for cytochrome bc1 complex (III) function. Importantly, mutations predicted to disrupt a conserved PE-binding site in the complex III subunit, Qcr7p, impaired complex III activity similar to PSD1 deletion. Collectively, these data demonstrate that PE made in the IM by Psd1p is critical to support the intrinsic functionality of complex III and establish one likely mechanism.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFully grown mammalian oocytes and eggs are transcriptionally quiescent, and therefore have a unique RNA environment in which cellular processes depend on post-transcriptional regulation. RNA editing of adenosines into inosines (A-to-I) by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) is a common post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanism, yet it has not been systematically studied in oocytes.\\n\\nResultsA genome-wide RNA editing analysis of transcriptionally active growing oocytes from postnatal day 12 (PND12) mice, fully grown germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes, and transcriptionally quiescent metaphase II (MII) eggs indicates an abundant amount of A-to-I editing of mRNA transcripts. Editing of mRNA was greatest in GV oocyte and MII eggs compared to the PND12 immature oocytes, this was consistent with ADAR1 levels within these cells. Compared to somatic tissues, oocytes exhibited a different pattern of RNA editing, with a high proportion of RNA edits occurring in the coding regions. These edits resulted in nucleotide substitutions that were enriched at the third nucleotide of the codon (wobble position). Codon usage can affect mRNA stability and translation efficiency.\\n\\nConclusionsRNA editing in mouse oocytes is distinct from RNA editing in somatic cells due to increased frequencies of coding sequence RNA edits. We provide evidence in support of a previously unreported phenomenon of selective ADAR1 editing of the codon wobble position. Editing of the wobble position has the potential to fine tune post-transcriptional gene regulation through altering codon usage. This important observation advances our current understanding of RNA editing in mammalian cells.",

Even though empirical distributions appear to follow a handful of qualitative laws, it is still unclear if and how quantitative variation in SADs reflects peculiar features of the communities and their environmental context. Here, we use the extensive dataset generated by the Tara Oceans expedition for marine microbial eukaryotes (protists) and an adaptive algorithm to explore how SADs vary across plankton communities in the global ocean. We show that the decay in abundance of non-dominant OTUs, comprising over 99% of local richness, is commonly governed by a power-law. The power-law exponent varies by less than 10% across locations and shows no biogeographical signature, but is weakly modulated by cell size. Our findings suggest that large-scale ubiquitous ecological processes govern the assembly of non-dominant plankton throughout the global ocean.",

Conservation targets were achieved in 43% less land area in plans based on annual vs. weekly optimizations.

Less land area was also needed to meet conservation targets when human-dominated lands were included rather than excluded from solutions.

Serum CRP, fibrinogen, and D-dimer were measured at baseline and serially while on treatment. Results: At baseline, all biomarkers were elevated with median CRP 86.15 mg/L (IQR 29.25-149.32), D-dimer 0.85 g/mL (IQR 0.34-1.80) and fibrinogen 4.11 g/L (IQR 3.75-6.31). CRP decreased significantly within 10 days of treatment initiation and fibrinogen within 28 days; D-dimer did not change significantly. 5 (25%) participants died. Older age (median age of 38y among survivors and 54y among deceased, p=0.008) and higher baseline fibrinogen (3.86 g/L among survivors and 6.37 g/L among deceased, p=0.02) were significantly associated with death.

Previous research has revealed that dim light at night (dLAN) dysregulates various immune functions and biorhythms, which hints that dLAN could change the risk of disease epidemics. Here, we demonstrate that dLAN enhances infectiousness of the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), an urban-dwelling avian host of West Nile virus (WNV). Sparrows exposed to dLAN maintained viral titers above the transmission threshold to a biting vector (105 plaque-forming units) for two days longer than controls but did not die at higher rates. A mathematical model revealed that such effects could increase WNV outbreak potential by ~41%. dLAN likely affects other host and vector traits relevant to transmission, so additional research is needed to advise management of zoonotic diseases in light polluted areas.",

The protocol adds Ts to the 3 end of DNA templates, which is subsequently recognized and used by SMART poly(dA) primers for reverse transcription and then addition of PCR primers and sequencing adapters. The poly(dA) primers, however, can anneal to poly(T) sequences in a genome and amplify DNA fragments that are not enriched in the immunoprecipitated DNA templates.

    "abstract": "Seed plants vary tremendously in size and morphology. However, variation and covariation between plant traits may at least in part be governed by universal biophysical laws and biological constants. Metabolic Scaling Theory (MST) posits that whole-organismal metabolism and growth rate are under stabilizing selection that minimizes the scaling of hydrodynamic resistance and maximizes the scaling of resource uptake. This constrains variation in physiological traits and in the rate of biomass accumulation, so that they can be expressed as mathematical functions of plant size with near constant allometric scaling exponents across species. However, observed variation in scaling exponents questions the evolutionary drivers and the universality of allometric equations. We have measured growth scaling and fitness traits of 451 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions with sequenced genomes. Variation among accessions around the scaling exponent predicted by MST correlated with relative growth rate, seed production and stress resistance. Genomic analyses indicate that growth allometry is affected by many genes associated with local climate and abiotic stress response. The gene with the strongest effect, PUB4, has molecular signatures of balancing selection, suggesting that intraspecific variation in growth scaling is maintained by opposing selection on the trade-off between seed production and abiotic stress resistance. Our findings support a core MST prediction and suggest that variation in allometry contributes to local adaptation to contrasting environments. Our results help reconcile past debates on the origin of allometric scaling in biology, and begin to link adaptive variation in allometric scaling to specific genes.\\n\\nSignificance statementAre there biological constants unifying phenotypic diversity across scales? Metabolic Scaling Theory (MST) predicts mathematical regularity and constancy in the allometric scaling of growth rate with body size across species. Here, we show that adaptation to climate in Arabidopsis thaliana is associated with local strains that substantially deviate from the values predicted by MST. This deviation can be linked to increased stress tolerance at the expense of seed production, and it occurs through selection on genes that are involved in abiotic stress response and that are geographically correlated with climatic conditions. This highlights the evolutionary role of allometric diversification and helps establish the physiological bases of plant adaptation to contrasting environments.",

    "abstract": "Hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) invasion and preemptive logging practices alter the habitat structure of New England forests and may indirectly affect associated small mammal communities. Microhabitat structure was measured and small mammals were censused in eight large experimental plots to quantify and predict these effects. The Harvard Forest Long-Term Ecological Research experiment is a replicated two-block design that includes four 0.81-ha canopy treatments: 1) Hemlock Control, 2) Hardwood Control, 3) Girdled Treatment, in which hemlock trees were killed by girdling in 2005 and left standing to simulate HWA invasion, and 4) Logged Treatment, in which trees were removed to simulate preemptive logging management practices. Nine microhabitat characteristics were measured from plot photos revealing differences among microhabitat structure. Small mammals were censused with arrays of 49 Sherman traps per plot and population sizes of common species were estimated with mark-recapture analysis. Between 6 and 8 mammal species were recorded in all treatments and species composition varied slightly. Populations of two common rodents (Peromyscus spp.) were not affected by treatment, but the southern red-backed vole population was greatest in the Girdled treatment. Estimated species richness was greater in the Girdled treatment than the Hemlock control, but richness did not differ between Girdled and Logged treatments, which suggests preemptive logging is as detrimental to some small mammal species as HWA invasion. Overall, nine years post disturbance, there is little evidence of a major shift in small mammal community structure in response to woolly adelgid invasion, with only minor changes in relative abundance.",

    "abstract": "MainThe notion that intergenerational or transgenerational inheritance operates solely through genetic means is slowly being eroded: epigenetic mechanisms have been shown to induce heritable changes in gene activity in plants 1,2 and metazoans 1,3. Inheritance of DNA methylation provides a potential pathway for environmentally induced phenotypes to contribute to evolution of species and populations 1-4. However, in basal metazoans, it is unknown whether inheritance of CpG methylation patterns occurs across the genome (as in plants) or as rare exceptions (as in mammals) 4. Here, we demonstrate genome-wide intergenerational transmission of CpG methylation patterns from parents to sperm and larvae in a reef-building coral. We also show variation in hypermethylated genes in corals from distinct environments, indicative of responses to variations in temperature and salinity. These findings support a role of DNA methylation in the transgenerational inheritance of traits in corals, which may extend to enhancing their capacity to adapt to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional activation by p53 provides powerful, organism-wide tumor suppression. In this work, we demonstrate that the p53-induced transcriptome varies based on cell type, reflects cell type-specific activities, and is considerably more broad than previously anticipated. This behavior is strongly influenced by p53 engagement with differentially active cell type-specific enhancers and promoters. In epithelial cell types, p53 activity is dependent on the p53 family member p63, which displays widespread enhancer binding. Notably, we demonstrate that p63 is required for epithelial enhancer identity including enhancers used by p53 during stress-dependent signaling. Loss of p63, but not p53, leads to site-specific depletion of enhancer-associated chromatin modifications, suggesting that p63 functions as an enhancer maintenance factor in epithelial cells. Additionally, a subset of epithelial-specific enhancers is dependent on the activity of p63 providing a direct link between lineage determination and enhancer structure. These data suggest a broad, cell-intrinsic mechanism for regulating the p53-dependent cellular response to stress through differential regulation of cis-regulatory elements.",

    "abstract": "Interactions of anaerobic gut bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile, with the intestinal mucosa have been poorly studied due to challenges in culturing anaerobes with the oxygen-requiring gut epithelium. Although gut colonization by C. difficile is a key determinant of disease outcome, precise mechanisms of mucosal attachment and spread remain unclear. Here, using human gut epithelial monolayers co-cultured within dual environment chambers, we demonstrate that C. difficile adhesion to gut epithelial cells is accompanied by a gradual increase in bacterial numbers. Prolonged infection causes redistribution of actin and loss of epithelial integrity, accompanied by production of C. difficile spores, toxins and bacterial filaments. This 2-D dual chamber system was used to examine C. difficile interactions with the commensal Bacteroides dorei, and interestingly, C. difficile growth is significantly reduced in presence of B. dorei. Furthermore, in novel multilayer and 3-D gut models containing a myofibroblast layer, C. difficile adheres more efficiently to epithelial cells, as compared to the 2-D model, leading to a quicker destruction of the epithelium. Our study describes new controlled environment human gut models that enable host-anaerobe and pathogen-commensal interaction studies in vitro.",

Through the genetic induction of anti-Pax6 single-chain antibody secretion, we have analyzed Pax6 non-cell autonomous activity on the migration of cortical hem- and septum-derived Cajal-Retzius (CR) neurons by live imaging of flat mount developing cerebral cortices. We observed that blocking extracellular Pax6 disrupts tangential CR cell migration patterns. We found a decrease in the distance travelled and changes both in directionality and in the depth at which CR cells migrate. Tracking of single CR cells in mutant cortices revealed that extracellular Pax6 neutralization enhances or reduces contact repulsion in medial and lateral regions, respectively. This study demonstrates that secreted Pax6 controls neuronal migration thus acting as a bona fide morphogen at an early stage of cerebral cortex development.\\n\\nSummary statementCajal-Retzius cell distribution in the embryonic cortex participates in determining the size and positioning of cortical areas.

    "abstract": "Potato is the most economically important non-cereal food crop. Tuber formation in potato is regulated by phytohormones, cytokinins (CKs) in particular. The present work was aimed to study CK signal perception in potato. The sequenced potato genome of doubled monoploid Phureja was used for bioinformatic analysis and as a tool for identification of putative CK receptors from autotetraploid potato cv. Desiree. All basic elements of multistep phosphorelay (MSP) required for CK signal transduction were identified in Phureja genome, including three genes orthologous to three CK receptor genes (AHK 2-4) of Arabidopsis. As distinct from Phureja, autotetraploid potato contains at least two allelic isoforms of each receptor type. Putative receptor genes from Desiree plants were cloned, sequenced and expressed, and main characteristics of encoded proteins, firstly their consensus motifs, structure models, ligand-binding properties, and the ability to transmit CK signal, were determined. In all studied aspects the predicted sensor histidine kinases met the requirements for genuine CK receptors. Expression of potato CK receptors was found to be organ-specific and sensitive to growth conditions, particularly to sucrose content. Our results provide a solid basis for further in-depth study of CK signaling system and biotechnological improvement of potato.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian cell culture, the Golgi apparatus fragment upon DNA damage. GOLPH3, a Golgi component, is a phosphorylation target of DNA-PK after DNA damage and contributes to Golgi fragmentation. The function of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) ortholog of GOLPH3, Vps74, in the DNA damage response has been little studied, although genome-wide screens suggested a role at telomeres. In this study we investigated the role of Vps74 at telomeres and in the DNA damage response. We show that Vps74 decreases the fitness of telomere defective cdc13-1 cells and contributes to the fitness of yku70{Delta} cells. Importantly, loss of Vps74 in yku70{Delta} cells exacerbates the temperature dependent growth defects of these cells in a Chk1 and Mec1-dependent manner. Furthermore, Exo1 reduces fitness of vps74{Delta} yku70{Delta} cells suggesting that ssDNA contributes to the fitness defects of vps74{Delta} yku70{Delta} cells. Systematic genetic interaction analysis of vps74{Delta}, yku70{Delta} and yku70{Delta} vps74{Delta} cells suggests that vps74{Delta} causes a milder but similar defect to that seen in yku70{Delta} cells. vps74{Delta} cells have slightly shorter telomeres and loss of VPS74 in yku70{Delta} or mre11{Delta} cells further shortens the telomeres of these cells. Interestingly, loss of Vps74 leads to increased levels of Stn1, a partner of Cdc13 in the CST telomere capping complex. Overexpression of Stn1 was previously shown to cause telomere shortening, suppression of cdc13-1 and enhancement of yku70{Delta} growth defects, suggesting that increased levels of Stn1 may be the route by which Vps74 affects telomere function. These results establish Vps74 as a novel regulator of telomere biology.",

We report findings in 296 family trios from two large studies: 165 lymphoblastoid cell lines from the 1000 Genomes Project, and 131 blood samples from the Genome of the Netherlands participants (GoNL). Based on parental haplotypes we identified >2.8 million transcribed heterozygous SNVs phased for parental origin, and developed a robust statistical framework for measuring allelic expression. We identified a total of 45 imprinted genes and one imprinted unannotated transcript, 17 of which have not previously been reported as showing parental expression bias. Multiple novel imprinted transcripts showing incomplete parental expression bias were located adjacent to known strongly imprinted genes. For example, PXDC1, a gene which lies adjacent to the paternally-expressed gene FAM50B, shows a 2:1 paternal expression bias. Other novel imprinted genes had promoter regions that coincide with sites of parentally-biased DNA methylation identified in blood from uniparental disomy (UPD) samples, thus providing independent validation of our results. Using the stranded nature of the RNA-Seq data in LCLs we identified multiple loci with overlapping sense/antisense transcripts, of which one is expressed paternally and the other maternally. Using a sliding window approach, we searched for imprinted expression across the entire genome, identifying a novel imprinted putative lncRNA in 13q21.2.

Many aspects of this relationship have been investigated using transcriptomic analyses in the emerging model organism Aiptasia. However, previous studies identified thousands of putatively symbiosis-related genes, making it difficult to disentangle symbiosis-induced responses from undesired experimental parameters. Using a meta-analysis approach, we identified a core set of 731 high-confidence symbiosis-associated genes that reveal host-dependent recycling of waste ammonium and amino acid synthesis as central processes in this relationship. Combining transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we show that symbiont-derived carbon enables host recycling of ammonium into nonessential amino acids. We propose that this provides a regulatory mechanism to control symbiont growth through a carbon-dependent negative feedback of nitrogen availability to the symbiont. The dependence of this mechanism on symbiont-derived carbon highlights the susceptibility of this symbiosis to changes in carbon translocation, as imposed by environmental stress.",

    "abstract": "The mycobacterial cell wall affords natural resistance to antibiotics. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) modify the surface properties of mycobacteria and can act synergistically with antibiotics from differing classes. Here we investigate the response of Mycobacterium smegmatis to the presence of rifampicin or capreomycin, either alone or in combination with two synthetic, cationic, -helical AMPs; distinguished by the presence (D-LAK120-HP13) or absence (D-LAK120-A) of a kink-inducing proline. Using a combination of high-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) NMR of bacteria, diphenylhexatriene (DPH) fluorescence anisotropy and laurdan emission spectroscopy we show that M. smegmatis responds to challenge with rifampicin or capreomycin by substantially altering its metabolism and, in particular, by remodelling the cell envelope. In NMR spectra of bacteria, reductions in intensity for mycolic acid lipid -(CH2)-, -CH3, R2CH-COOH, R2CH-OH and also -CH2-(CH==CH)- and -CH=CH- resonances were observed following challenge with rifampicin and capreomycin, while the latter also caused an increase in trehalose. These changes are consistent with a reduction of trehalose dimycolate and increase of trehalose monomycolate and are associated with an increase in rigidity of the mycolic acid layer observed following challenge by capreomycin but not rifampicin. Challenge with D-LAK120-A or D-LAK120-HP13 induced no or modest changes respectively in these metabolites and did not induce a significant increase in rigidity of the mycolic acid layer. Further, the response to rifampicin or capreomycin was significantly reduced when these were combined respectively with D-LAK120-HP13 and D-LAK120-A, suggesting a possible mechanism for the synergy of these combinations. The remodelling of the mycomembrane in M. smegmatis is therefore identified as an important countermeasure deployed against rifampicin or capreomycin, but this can be mitigated, and rifampicin or capreomycin efficacy potentiated, by combining with AMPs.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNA) regulate fundamental biological processes, including neuronal plasticity, stress response, and survival. Here we describe a neuroprotective function of miR-132, the miRNA most significantly down-regulated in Alzheimers disease. miR-132 protects mouse and human wild-type neurons and more vulnerable Tau-mutant primary neurons against amyloid {beta}-peptide (A{beta}) and glutamate excitotoxicity. It lowers the levels of total, phosphorylated, acetylated, and cleaved forms of Tau implicated in tauopathies, promotes neurite elongation and branching, and reduces neuronal death. Similarly, miR-132 attenuates PHF Tau pathology and neurodegeneration and enhances long-term potentiation in the P301S Tau transgenic mice. The neuroprotective effects are mediated by direct regulation of the Tau modifiers acetyltransferase EP300, kinase GSK3{beta}, RNA-binding protein Rbfox1, and proteases Calpain 2 and Caspases 3/7. These data suggest miR-132 as a master regulator of neuronal health and indicate that miR-132 supplementation could be of therapeutic benefit for the treatment of Tau-associated neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are common inherited genetic variants, have been identified that are associated with risk of colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the ability of these SNPs to estimate colorectal cancer (CRC) risk for persons with and without a family history of CRC, and the screening implications.\\n\\nMethodsWe estimated the association with CRC of a 45 SNP-based risk using 1,181 cases and 999 controls, and its correlation (r) with CRC risk predicted from detailed family history. We estimated the predicted change in the distribution across predefined risk categories, and implications for recommended age to commence screening, from adding SNP-based risk to family history.\\n\\nResultsThe inter-quintile risk ratio for colorectal cancer risk of the SNP-based risk was 2.46 (95% CI 1.91 - 3.11). SNP-based and family history-based risks were not correlated (r = 0.02). For persons with no first-degree relatives with CRC, recommended screening would commence 2 years earlier for women (4 years for men) in the highest quintile of SNP-based risk, and 12 years later for women (7 years for men) in the lowest quintile. For persons with two first-degree relatives with CRC, recommended screening would commence 15 years earlier for men and women in the highest quintile, and 8 years earlier for men and women in the lowest quintile.\\n\\nConclusionsRisk reclassification by 45 SNPs could inform targeted screening for CRC prevention, particularly in clinical genetics settings when mutations in high-risk genes cannot be identified.",

    "abstract": "Although the cost of long term care of physical disabilities is considerable, little is known about individual trajectories of physical function (measured by gait speed and grip strength) that preceded the process of disablement. Moreover, studies on trajectories of health function have often ignored cohort composition, precluding evidence of secular improvement. And few have explored the role of chronic inflammation on older peoples physical function trajectories. Using the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing 2004-2013 we derived trajectories of gait speed and grip strength of Britons aged [&ge;] 50 years and investigated the effect of inflammation. Then we drew trajectories for different cohorts to seek evidence of secular improvement. We uncovered a complex gradient of improvement in trajectories of physical function that depends on sex and maximum versus normal capacity. In conclusion, accounting for the cohort composition of older people can materially modify the future cost of long term care.",

    "abstract": "Quorum sensing is a cell-cell communication process that bacteria use to orchestrate group behaviors. Quorum sensing is mediated by extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers. Autoinducers are often structurally similar, raising questions concerning how bacteria distinguish among them. Here, we use the Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasR quorum-sensing receptor to explore receptor sensitivity and selectivity. Alteration of LasR amino acid S129 increases ligand selectivity and decreases ligand sensitivity. Conversely, the L130F mutation enhances LasR sensitivity while reducing selectivity. We solve crystal structures of LasR ligand binding domains complexed with non-cognate autoinducers. Comparison to existing structures reveals that ligand selectivity/sensitivity is mediated by a flexible loop adjacent to the ligand binding site. We show that P. aeruginosa harboring LasR variants with modified selectivity or sensitivity exhibit altered quorum-sensing responses. We suggest that an evolutionary trade-off between ligand selectivity and sensitivity enables LasR to optimally regulate quorum-sensing traits.",
