    "abstract": "Copy number variants (CNVs) are known to affect a large portion of the human genome and have been implicated in many diseases. Although whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can help identify CNVs, most analytical methods suffer from limited sensitivity and specificity, especially in regions of low mappability. To address this, we use PopSV, a CNV caller that relies on multiple samples to control for technical variation. We demonstrate that our calls are stable across different types of repeat-rich regions and validate the accuracy of our predictions using orthogonal approaches. Applying PopSV to 640 human genomes, we find that low-mappability regions are approximately 5 times more likely to harbor germline CNVs, in stark contrast to the nearly uniform distribution observed for somatic CNVs in 95 cancer genomes. In addition to known enrichments in segmental duplication and near centromeres and telomeres, we also report that CNVs are enriched in specific types of satellite and in some of the most recent families of transposable elements. Finally, using this comprehensive approach, we identify 3,455 regions with recurrent CNVs that were missing from existing catalogs. In particular, we identify 347 genes with a novel exonic CNV in low-mappability regions, including 29 genes previously associated with disease.",

    "abstract": "Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDecision-making is central to cognition. Abnormally-formed decisions characterize disorders like over-eating, Parkinsons and Huntingtons diseases, OCD, addiction, and compulsive gambling. Yet, a unified account of decisionmaking has, hitherto, remained elusive. Here we show the essential composition of the brains decision mechanism by matching experimental data from monkeys making decisions, to the knowable function of a novel statistical inference algorithm. Our algorithm maps onto the large-scale architecture of decision circuits in the primate brain, replicating the monkeys choice behaviour and the dynamics of the neural activity that accompany it. Validated in this way, our algorithm establishes a basic framework for understanding the mechanistic ingredients of decisionmaking in the brain, and thereby, a basic platform for understanding how pathologies arise from abnormal function.",

    "abstract": "Perception is produced by  reading out the representation of a sensory stimulus contained in the firing rates of a population of neurons. To examine experimentally how populations code information, a common approach is to decode a linearly-weighted sum of the neurons firing rates. This approach is popular because of its biological validity: weights in a computational decoder are analogous to synaptic strengths. For neurons recorded in vivo, weights are highly variable when derived through machine learning methods, but it is unclear what neuronal properties explain this variability, and how the variability affects decoding performance. To address this, we recorded from neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of anesthetized marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) viewing stimuli comprising a sheet of dots that moved coherently in one of twelve different directions. We found that high gain and direction selectivity both predicted that a neuron would be weighted more highly in an optimised decoding model. Although learned weights differed markedly from weights chosen according to a priori rules based on a neurons tuning profile, decoding performance was only marginally better for the learned weights. In the models with a priori rules, selectivity is the best predictor of weighting, and defining weights according to a neurons preferred direction and selectivity improves decoding performance to very near the maximum level possible, as defined by the learned weights.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyWe examined which aspects of a neurons tuning account for its contribution to sensory coding. Strongly direction-selective neurons were weighted most highly by machine learning algorithms trained to discriminate motion direction. Models with a priori defined decoding weights demonstrate that the learned weighting scheme causally improved direction representation by a neuronal population. Optimising decoders (using machine learning) lead to only marginally better performance than decoders based purely on a neurons preferred direction and selectivity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCytokines are critical to human disease and are attractive therapeutic targets given their widespread influence on gene regulation and transcription. Defining the downstream regulatory mechanisms influenced by cytokines is central to defining drug and disease mechanisms. One promising strategy is to use interactions between expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and cytokine levels to define target genes and mechanisms.\\n\\nResultsIn a clinical trial for anti-IL-6 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus we measured interferon (IFN) status, anti-IL-6 drug exposure and genome-wide gene expression at three time points (379 samples from 157 individuals). First, we show that repeat transcriptomic measurements increases the number of cis eQTLs identified compared to using a single time point by 64%. Then, after identifying 4,818 cis-eQTLs, we observed a statistically significant enrichment of in vivo eQTL interactions with IFN status (p<0.001 by permutation) and anti-IL-6 drug exposure (p<0.001). We observed 210 and 72 interactions for IFN and anti-IL-6 respectively (FDR<20%). Anti-IL-6 interactions have not yet been described while 99 of the IFN interactions are novel. Finally, we found transcription factor binding motifs interrupted by eQTL interaction SNPs, pointing to key regulatory mediators of these environmental stimuli and therefore potential therapeutic targets for autoimmune diseases. In particular, genes with IFN interactions are enriched for ISRE binding site motifs, while those with anti-IL-6 interactions are enriched for IRF4 motifs.\\n\\nConclusionThis study highlights the potential to exploit clinical trial data to discover in vivo eQTL interactions with therapeutically relevant environmental variables.",

    "abstract": "Natural environments convey information through multiple sensory modalities, all of which contribute to peoples percepts. Although it has been shown that visual or auditory content of scene categories can be decoded from brain activity, it remains unclear where and how humans integrate different sensory inputs and represent scene information beyond a specific sensory modality domain. To address this question, we investigated how categories of scene images and sounds are represented in several brain regions. A mixed gender group of healthy human subjects participated the present study, where their brain activity was measured with fMRI while viewing images or listening to sounds of different places. We found that both visual and auditory scene categories can be decoded not only from modality-specific areas, but also from several brain regions in the temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortex. Intriguingly, only in the prefrontal cortex, but not in any other regions, categories of scene images and sounds appear to be represented in similar activation patterns, suggesting that scene representations in the prefrontal cortex are modality-independent. Furthermore, the error patterns of neural decoders indicate that category-specific neural activity patterns in the middle and superior frontal gyri are tightly linked to categorization behavior. Our findings demonstrate that complex scene information is represented at an abstract level in the prefrontal cortex, regardless of the sensory modality of the stimulus.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceOur experience in daily life requires the integration of multiple sensory inputs such as images, sounds, or scents from the environment. Here, for the first time, we investigated where and how in the brain information about the natural environment from multiple senses is merged to form modality-independent representations of scene categories. We show direct decoding of scene categories across sensory modalities from patterns of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex. We also conclusively tie these neural representations to human categorization behavior based on the errors from the neural decoder and behavior. Our findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex is a central hub for integrating sensory information and computing modality-independent representations of scene categories.",

    "abstract": "The latent period is a crucial life history trait, particularly for polycyclic plant diseases, because it determines how many complete monocycles could theoretically occur during an epidemic. Many empirical studies have focused on the variation of the latent period with pathogen or host genotype, or changes in response to environmental factors. The focus on these aspects is unsurprising, as these factors classically form the three parts of the epidemiological triangle. Experiments in controlled conditions are generally used to assess pathogenicity and host susceptibility, and also provide the opportunity to measure the distribution of latent periods in epidemiological systems. Once estimated for one or several pairs of host-pathogen genotypes, the mean value of this important trait is usually considered to be fixed and is often used \\\"as is\\\" in epidemiological models. We show here that the latent period can display non-negligible variability over the course of a disease epidemic, and that this variability has multiple sources, some of which have complex, antagonistic impacts. We develop arguments for four sources of variation that challenge the implicit assumption that the latent period remains constant: daily fluctuations in leaf temperature, nature of inoculum, host stage or age of host tissues, intra-population competition and selection for aggressiveness traits. We focus on the wheat fungal disease Septoria tritici blotch (Zymoseptoria tritici), making use of empirical datasets collected during the first authors own research projects and a targeted literature review. Such empirical epidemiological knowledge is new and potentially important for modelers. While some studies have demonstrated that the distribution of latent periods around the mean value has consequences for epidemiological dynamics, we show that it might also be important for epidemiological modelers to account for changes in this mean value during an annual epidemic. These results may be of critical importance for improving outbreak forecasting.",

    "abstract": "During cytokinesis, an equatorial actomyosin contractile ring constricts at a relatively constant overall rate despite its progressively decreasing size. Thus, the per-unit-length rate of ring closure increases as ring perimeter decreases. To understand this acceleration, we monitored cortical surface and ring component dynamics during the first division of the C. elegans embryo. We show that the polar cortex expands during ring constriction to provide the cortical surface area required for division. Polar expansion also allows ring myosin to compress cortical surface along the pole-to-pole axis, leading to a continuous flow of cortical surface into the ring. We propose that feedback between ring myosin and compression-driven cortical flow drives an exponential increase in the amount of ring myosin that maintains the high overall closure rate as ring perimeter decreases. We further show that an analytical mathematical formulation of the proposed feedback, called the Compression Feedback model, recapitulates the experimental observations.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTDuring cytokinesis, positive feedback between myosin motors in the contractile ring and compression-driven cortical flow along the axis perpendicular to the ring drives constriction rate acceleration to ensure timely cell separation.\\n\\nMAJOR SUBJECT AREASCell biology, Computational and Systems Biology",

Based on animal work showing that within-region variability can be a primary function of synaptic input, we used fMRI to test in humans whether greater temporal variability in local brain regions was associated with higher functional network integration. We found that individuals with higher local temporal variability had a more integrated (lower-dimensional) network fingerprint, with temporal variability in the thalamus showing the strongest association with network dimensionality. Beyond animal findings showing that local variability should upregulate from thalamus to visual cortex, we found that local variability upregulated from thalamus to all structurally connected cortical targets. Critically, greater within-person thalamo-cortical upregulation was associated with higher integration in 12 of 13 examined networks. Our findings indicate that local variability primarily reflects functional integration, with the thalamus acting as a relay or modulator of variability in cortex.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which prehistoric migrations of farmers influenced the genetic pool of western North Africans remains unclear. Archaeological evidence suggests the Neolithization process may have happened through the adoption of innovations by local Epipaleolithic communities, or by demic diffusion from the Eastern Mediterranean shores or Iberia. Here, we present the first analysis of individuals genome sequences from early and late Neolithic sites in Morocco, as well as Early Neolithic individuals from southern Iberia. We show that Early Neolithic Moroccans are distinct from any other reported ancient individuals and possess an endemic element retained in present-day Maghrebi populations, confirming a long-term genetic continuity in the region. Among ancient populations, Early Neolithic Moroccans are distantly related to Levantine Natufian hunter-gatherers ([~]9,000 BCE) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic farmers ([~]6,500 BCE). Although an expansion in Early Neolithic times is also plausible, the high divergence observed in Early Neolithic Moroccans suggests a long-term isolation and an early arrival in North Africa for this population. This scenario is consistent with early Neolithic traditions in North Africa deriving from Epipaleolithic communities who adopted certain innovations from neighbouring populations. Late Neolithic ([~]3,000 BCE) Moroccans, in contrast, share an Iberian component, supporting theories of trans-Gibraltar gene flow. Finally, the southern Iberian Early Neolithic samples share the same genetic composition as the Cardial Mediterranean Neolithic culture that reached Iberia [~]5,500 BCE. The cultural and genetic similarities of the Iberian Neolithic cultures with that of North African Neolithic sites further reinforce the model of an Iberian migration into the Maghreb.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe acquisition of agricultural techniques during the so-called Neolithic revolution has been one of the major steps forward in human history. Using next-generation sequencing and ancient DNA techniques, we directly test if Neolithization in North Africa occurred through the transmission of ideas or by demic diffusion. We show that Early Neolithic Moroccans are composed of an endemic Maghrebi element still retained in present-day North African populations and distantly related to Epipaleolithic communities from the Levant. However, late Neolithic individuals from North Africa are admixed, with a North African and a European component. Our results support the idea that the Neolithization of North Africa might have involved both the development of Epipaleolithic communities and the migration of people from Europe.",

    "abstract": "Despite major strides in the treatment of cancer, the development of drug resistance remains a major hurdle. One strategy which has been proposed to address this is the sequential application of drug therapies where resistance to one drug induces sensitivity to another drug, a concept called collateral sensitivity. The optimal timing of drug switching in these situations, however, remains unknown.\\n\\nTo study this, we developed a dynamical model of sequential therapy on heterogeneous tumors comprised of resistant and sensitive cells. A pair of drugs (DrugA, DrugB) are utilized and are periodically switched during therapy. Assuming resistant cells to one drug are collaterally sensitive to the opposing drug, we classified cancer cells into two groups, AR and BR, each of which is a subpopulation of cells resistant to the indicated drug and concurrently sensitive to the other, and we subsequently explored the resulting population dynamics.\\n\\nSpecifically, based on a system of ordinary differential equations for AR and BR, we determined that the optimal treatment strategy consists of two stages: an initial stage in which a chosen effective drug is utilized until a specific time point, T, and a second stage in which drugs are switched repeatedly, during which each drug is used for a relative duration (i.e. f{Delta}t-long for DrugA and (1 - f) {Delta}t-long for DrugB with 0 [&le;] f [&le;] 1 and {Delta}t [&ge;] 0). We prove that the optimal duration of the initial stage, in which the first drug is administered, T, is shorter than the period in which it remains effective in decreasing the total population, contrary to current clinical intuition.\\n\\nWe further analyzed the relationship between population makeup, [Formula], and the effect of each drug. We determine a critical ratio, which we term [Formula], at which the two drugs are equally effective. As the first stage of the optimal strategy is applied, [Formula] changes monotonically to [Formula] and then, during the second stage, remains at [Formula] thereafter.\\n\\nBeyond our analytic results, we explored an individual based stochastic model and presented the distribution of extinction times for the classes of solutions found. Taken together, our results suggest opportunities to improve therapy scheduling in clinical oncology.",

    "abstract": "A universal feature of metazoan reproduction is the elimination of the maternal centrosomes prior to the end of oogenesis. In animals that have a syncytial cyst stage of oocyte development, including Drosophila and mouse, the germline centrosomes undergo a migration to all reside within the oocyte. However, the functional significance of centrosome transport within the female germline and the mechanism orchestrating this event are still a mystery. The Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) is a multi-subunit ubiquitin ligase (E3) that temporally regulates progression of the cell cycle as well as the centrosome cycle. By altering the negative regulation of the cooperating ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2), Vihar/Ube2c, we show that temporal control of APC/C activity ensures centrosome stability and migration during early Drosophila oogenesis. When there is perduring APC/C activity, Polo kinase is precociously targeted for destruction, which results in centriole instability and decreased centrosome transport to the oocyte. We show that decreased centrosome transport correlates with a decreased accumulation of pericentriolar material (PCM) proteins on the oocyte nucleus, which results in a weakening of the structural integrity of the egg chamber and loss of oocyte fate - the overall consequence being a reduction in female fertility. Considering the conserved roles of the APC/C and Polo kinase throughout the animal kingdom and the fact that many animals have a syncytial stage of egg development, our results provide insight into the general necessity of gametic centrosome transport for female fertility.",

    "abstract": "Here we address the current issues of inefficiency and over-penalization in the massively univariate approach followed by the correction for multiple testing, and propose a more efficient model that pools and shares information among brain regions. Using Bayesian multilevel (BML) modeling, we control two types of error that are more relevant than the conventional false positive rate (FPR): incorrect sign (type S) and incorrect magnitude (type M). BML also aims to achieve two goals: 1) improving modeling efficiency by having one integrative model and thereby dissolving the multiple testing issue, and 2) turning the focus of conventional null hypothesis significant testing (NHST) on FPR into quality control by calibrating type S errors while maintaining a reasonable level of inference efficiency The performance and validity of this approach are demonstrated through an application at the region of interest (ROI) level, with all the regions on an equal footing: unlike the current approaches under NHST, small regions are not disadvantaged simply because of their physical size. In addition, compared to the massively univariate approach, BML may simultaneously achieve increased spatial specificity and inference efficiency, and promote results reporting in totality and transparency. The benefits of BML are illustrated in performance and quality checking using an experimental dataset. The methodology also avoids the current practice of sharp and arbitrary thresholding in the p-value funnel to which the multidimensional data are reduced. The BML approach with its auxiliary tools is available as part of the AFNI suite for general use.",

    "abstract": "Canalization of developmental processes ensures the reproducibility and robustness of embryogenesis within each species. In its extreme form, found in ascidians, early embryonic cell lineages are invariant between embryos within and between species, despite rapid genomic divergence. To resolve this paradox, we used live light-sheet imaging to quantify individual cell behaviors in digitalized embryos and explore the forces that canalize their development. This quantitative approach revealed that individual cell geometries and cell contacts are strongly constrained, and that these constraints are tightly linked to the control of fate specification by local cell inductions. While in vertebrates ligand concentration usually controls cell inductions, we found that this role is fulfilled in ascidians by the area of contacts between signaling and responding cells. We propose that the duality between geometric and genetic control of inductions contributes to the counterintuitive inverse correlation between geometric and genetic variability during embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection plays a variety of roles in hybridization, speciation and admixture. Most research has focused on two extreme cases: crosses between closely-related inbred lines, where hybrids are fitter than their parents, or crosses between effectively isolated species, where hybrids suffer severe breakdown. Many natural populations must fall into intermediate regimes, with multiple types of gene interaction, but these are more difficult to study. Here, we develop a simple fitness landscape model, and show that it naturally interpolates between previous modeling approaches, involving mildly deleterious recessives, or discrete hybrid incompatibilities. The model yields several new predictions, which we test with genomic data from Mytilus mussels, and published data from plants (Zea, Populus and Senecio) and animals (Mus, Teleogryllus and Drosophila). The predictions are generally supported, and the model explains surprising empirical patterns that have been observed in both extreme regimes. Our approach enables novel and complementary uses of genome-wide datasets, which do not depend on identifying outlier loci, or \\\"speciation genes\\\" with anomalous effects. Given its simplicity and flexibility, and its predictive successes with a wide range of data, the approach should be readily extendable to other outstanding questions in the study of hybridization.",

    "abstract": "Uncovering common principles by which diverse modalities of information are processed is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. In mammalian brain, thalamus is the central processing station for inputs from sensory systems, subcortical motor systems, and cortex; a function subserved by over 30 defined nuclei1,2. Multiple thalamic nuclei send convergent information to each region of the forebrain, but whether there is a conserved architecture across the set of thalamic pathways projecting to each forebrain area has remained unresolved3-5. To uncover organizational principles of thalamic pathways, we produced a near-comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of thalamus. This revealed a common logic for thalamic nuclei serving all major cortical modalities. We found that almost all nuclei belong to one of three major profiles, with a given cortical area getting input from each of these profiles. These profiles lie on a single axis of variance aligned with the mediolateral axis of thalamus, and this axis is strongly enriched in genes encoding receptors and ion channels. We further show that each projection profile exhibits different electrophysiological signatures. Single-cell profiling revealed that rather than forming discrete classes, thalamic neurons lie on a spectrum, with intermediate cells existing between profiles. Thus, in contrast to canonical models of thalamus that suggest it is a switchboard primarily concerned with routing distinct modalities of information to distinct cortical regions, we show that the thalamocortical system is more akin to a molecularly-defined  filter bank repeatedly applied across modality. Together, we reveal striking covariation in the organization of thalamic pathways serving all input modalities and output targets, establishing a simple and comprehensive thalamic functional architecture.",

Despite having well described extracellular functions, the mechanism of annexin transport from the cytoplasmic inner leaflet to the extracellular outer leaflet of the plasma membrane remains unclear. Here, we show that phospholipid flipping activity is crucial for the transport of annexins A2 and A5 across membranes in cells and in liposomes. We identified TMEM16F (anoctamin-6) as a lipid scramblase required for transport of these annexins to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane.

However, it is unknown how learning to read affects development of distributed visual representations across human ventral temporal cortex (VTC). Using fMRI and a data-driven, computational approach, we quantified the development of distributed VTC responses to characters (pseudowords and numbers) vs. other domains in children, preteens, and adults. Results reveal anatomical- and hemisphere-specific development. With development, distributed responses to words and characters became more distinctive and informative in lateral but not medial VTC, and in the left but not right hemisphere. While development of voxels with both positive (that is, word-selective) and negative preference to words affected distributed information, only development of word-selective voxels predicted reading ability. These data show that developmental increases in informativeness of distributed left lateral VTC responses enable proficient reading and have important implications for both developmental theories and for elucidating neural mechanisms of reading disabilities.",

To overcome such limitations, we have developed psichomics, an R package with an intuitive graphical interface for alternative splicing quantification and downstream dimensionality reduction, differential splicing and gene expression and survival analyses based on The Cancer Genome Atlas, the Genotype-Tissue Expression project and user-provided data. These integrative analyses can also incorporate clinical and molecular sample-associated features.

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) develops silently over decades. We cannot easily access and analyse pre-symptomatic brains, so the earliest molecular changes that initiate AD remain unclear. Previously, we demonstrated that the genes mutated in early-onset, dominantly-inherited familial forms of AD (fAD) are evolving particularly rapidly in mice and rats. Fortunately, some non-mammalian vertebrates such as the zebrafish preserve fAD-relevant transcript isoforms of the PRESENILIN (PSEN1 and PSEN2) genes that these rodents have lost. Zebrafish are powerful vertebrate genetic models for many human diseases, but no genetic model of fAD in zebrafish currently exists. We edited the zebrafish genome to model the unique, protein-truncating fAD mutation of human PSEN2, K115fs. Analysing the brain transcriptome and proteome of young (6-month-old) and aged, infertile (24-month-old) wild type and heterozygous fAD-like mutant female sibling zebrafish supports accelerated brain aging and increased glucocorticoid signalling in young fAD-like fish, leading to a transcriptional  inversion into glucocorticoid resistance and vast changes in biological pathways in aged, infertile fAD-like fish. Notably, one of these changes involving microglia-associated immune responses regulated by the ETS transcription factor family is preserved between our zebrafish fAD model and human early-onset AD. Importantly, these changes occur before obvious histopathology and likely in the absence of A{beta}. Our results support the contributions of early metabolic and oxidative stresses to immune and stress responses favouring AD pathogenesis and highlight the value of our fAD-like zebrafish genetic model for elucidating early changes in the brain that promote AD pathogenesis. The success of our approach has important implications for future modelling of AD.",

    "abstract": "Containment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection requires T cell recognition of infected macrophages. Mtb has evolved to tolerate, evade, and subvert host immunity. Despite a vigorous and sustained CD8+ T cell response during Mtb infection, CD8+ T cells make limited contribution to protection. Here, we ask whether the ability of Mtb-specific T cells to restrict Mtb growth is related to their capacity to recognize Mtb-infected macrophages.\\n\\nWe derived CD8+ T cell lines that recognized the Mtb immunodominant epitope TB10.44-11 and compared them to CD4+ T cell lines that recognized Ag85b240-254 or ESAT63-17. While the CD4+ T cells recognized Mtb-infected macrophages and inhibited Mtb growth in vitro, the TB10.4-specific CD8+ T cells neither recognized Mtb-infected macrophages nor restricted Mtb growth. TB10.4-specific CD8+ T cells recognized macrophages infected with Listeria monocytogenes expressing TB10.4. However, over-expression of TB10.4 in Mtb did not confer recognition by TB10.4-specific CD8+ T cells. Importantly, CD8+ T cells recognized macrophages pulsed with irradiated Mtb, indicating that macrophages can efficiently cross-present the TB10.4 protein and raising the possibility that viable bacilli might suppress cross-presentation. Importantly, polyclonal CD8+ T cells specific for Mtb antigens other than TB10.4 recognized Mtb-infected macrophages in a MHC-restricted manner.\\n\\nAs TB10.4 elicits a dominant CD8+ T cell response that poorly recognizes Mtb-infected macrophages, we propose that TB10.4 acts as a decoy antigen. Moreover, it appears that this response overshadows subdominant CD8+ T cell response that can recognize Mtb-infected macrophages. The ability of Mtb to subvert the CD8+ T cell response may explain why CD8+ T cells make a disproportionately small contribution to host defense compared to CD4+ T cells. The selection of Mtb antigens for vaccines has focused on antigens that generate immunodominant responses. We propose that establishing whether vaccine-elicited, Mtb-specific T cells recognize Mtb-infected macrophages could be a useful criterion for preclinical vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "Necrotic enteritis (NE) caused by Clostridium perfringens infection has reemerged as a prevalent poultry disease worldwide due to reduced usage of prophylactic antibiotics. The lack of alternative antimicrobial strategies to control this disease is mainly due to limited insight into NE pathogenesis, microbiome relationships, and host responses. Here we reported that the metabolic byproduct of microbial metabolism of bile acids to deoxycholic acid (DCA), at as low as 50 M, inhibited 82.8% of C. perfringens growth in Tryptic Soy Broth (P < 0.05). Sequential Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens challenge strongly induced NE, severe intestinal inflammation, and body weight (BW) loss in broiler chickens. These negative effects were diminished by 1.5 g/kg DCA diet. At the cellular level, DCA alleviated NE-associated ileal epithelial death and lamina propria immune cell apoptosis. Interestingly, DCA reduced C. perfringens invasion into villi without significantly altering the bacterial luminal colonization. Molecular analysis showed that DCA reduced inflammatory mediators of Inf{gamma}, Litaf (Tnf), Il1{beta}, and Mmp9 mRNA accumulation in ileal tissue. Mechanically, C. perfringens induced elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines of Inf{gamma}, Litaf, and Ptgs2 (COX-2 gene) in chicken splenocytes. Inhibiting the COX signaling by aspirin attenuated INF{gamma}- or TNFa-induced inflammatory response in the splenocytes. Consistently, chickens fed 0.12 g/kg aspirin diet resisted against NE-induced BW loss, ileal inflammation, and villus apoptosis. In conclusion, microbial metabolic product DCA prevents NE-induced BW loss and ileal inflammation through curbing inflammatory response. These novel findings could serve as a stepping-stone for developing next generation antimicrobial alternatives against NE.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we assessed invasions of Psittaciformes in Puerto Rico. We reviewed the literature, public databases, citizen science records, and performed in situ population surveys across the island to determine the historical and current status and distribution of psittacine species. We used count data from Ebird to determine population trends. For species whose populations were increasing, we modelled their potential distribution using niche modeling techniques. Focusing on the white-winged parakeet (Brotogeris versicolurus), which was considered the most successful psittacine species by the year 2000, we evaluated the population size, calculated growth rates and estimated the breeding proportion in two populations by performing roost counts for four consecutive years. We found a total of 46 Psittaciformes present in Puerto Rico, of which 26% are only present as pets, at least 29 species have been reported in the wild, and of those, there is evidence that at least 12 species are breeding. Our results indicate that most introduced species which have been detected as established still persist, although mostly in localized areas and small populations. Clear evidence of invasiveness was found for B. versicolurus and Myiopsitta monachus, which have greatly expanded their range. Moreover, Psittacara erythrogenys and Eupsittacula canicularis also showed population increase. The niche models predicted suitable areas for the four species, and also indicate the potential for range expansion. Population estimates of the white-winged parakeet during the study period showed a steady increase, and exhibited exponential growth, with geometric mean population growth rates of 1.25 per year. Currently growth rate of the white-winged parakeet does not appear to be limited by any predator, resources or nest availability, and we expect them to continue increasing and expanding their range. We discuss the factors leading to invasion success, assess the potential impacts, and we discuss possible management strategies and research prospects.",

This study confirms the circulation of Dengue fever, Yellow fever and West Nile viruses in Ogbomoso and therefore suggest the need for public awareness on vector control.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression can be noisy1,2, as can the growth of single cells3,4. Such cell-to-cell variation has been implicated in survival strategies for bacterial populations5-7. However, it remains unclear how single cells couple gene expression with growth to implement these survival strategies. Here we show how noisy expression of a key stress response regulator, rpoS8, allows E. coli to modulate its growth dynamics to survive future adverse environments. First, we demonstrate that rpoS has a long-tailed distribution of expression in an unstressed population of cells. We next reveal how a dynamic positive feedback loop between rpoS and growth rate produces multi-generation rpoS pulses, which are responsible for the rpoS heterogeneity. We do so experimentally with single-cell, time-lapse microscopy9 and microfluidics10 and theoretically with a stochastic model11,22. Finally, we demonstrate the function of the coupling of heterogeneous rpoS activity and growth. It enables E. coli to survive oxidative attack by causing prolonged periods of slow growth. This dynamic phenotype is captured by the rpoS-growth feedback model. Our synthesis of noisy gene expression, growth, and survival paves the way for further exploration of functional phenotypic variability.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionNon-publication of clinical trials results is an ongoing issue. In 2016 the US government updated the results reporting requirements to ClinicalTrials.gov for trials covered under the FDA Amendments Act 2007. We set out to develop and deliver an online tool which publicly monitors compliance with these reporting requirements, facilitates open public audit, and promotes accountability.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a review of the relevant legislation to extract the requirements on reporting results. Specific areas of the statutes were operationalized in code based on the results of our policy review, publicly available data from ClinicalTrials.gov, and communications with ClinicalTrials.gov staff. We developed methods to identify trials required to report results, using publicly available registry data; to incorporate additional relevant information such as key dates and trial sponsors; and to determine when each trial became due. This data was then used to construct a live tracking website.\n\nResultsThere were a number of administrative and technical hurdles to successful operationalization of our tracker. Decisions and assumptions related to overcoming these issues are detailed along with clarifications directly from ClinicalTrials.gov. The FDAAA TrialsTracker was successfully launched in February 2018 and provides users with an overview of results reporting compliance.\n\nDiscussionClinical trials continue to go unreported despite numerous guidelines, commitments, and legal frameworks intended to address this issue. In the absence of formal sanctions from the FDA and others, we argue tools such as ours - providing live data on trial reporting - can improve accountability and performance. In addition, our service helps sponsors identify their own individual trials that have not yet reported results: we therefore offer positive practical support for sponsors who wish to ensure that all their completed trials have reported.",

    "abstract": "The Cape Verde islands are part of the African Sahelian arid belt that possesses an irregular rainy season between August and October. This erratic rain pattern has prompted the need for water reservoirs, now critical for the countrys sustainability. Worldwide, freshwater cyanobacterial blooms are increasing in frequency due to global climate change and eutrophication of water bodies, particularly in reservoirs. To date there have been no risk assessments of cyanobacterial toxin production in these man-made structures. We evaluated this potential risk using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and full metagenome sequencing in freshwater reservoirs of Cape Verde.\\n\\nOur analysis revealed the presence of several potentially toxic cyanobacterial genera in all sampled reservoirs (Poilao, Saquinho and Faveta). In Faveta Microcystis sp., a genus well known for toxin production and bloom-formation, dominated our samples, while a green algae of the genus Cryptomonas and Gammaproteobacteria dominated Saquinho and Poilao.\\n\\nTaking advantage of the dominance of Microcystis in the Faveta reservoir, we were able to reconstruct and assemble its genome, extracted from a metagenome of bulk DNA from Faveta water. We named it Microcystis cf. aeruginosa CV01, for which a phylogenetic analysis revealed to have a close relationship with other genomes from those taxa, as well as other continental African strains, suggesting geographical coherency. In addition, it revealed several clusters of known toxin-producing genes. This assessment of Cape Verdean freshwater microbial diversity and potential for toxin production reinforces the need to better understand the microbial ecology as a whole of water reservoirs on the rise.",

    "abstract": "We present the first-ever detailed models of pyramidal cells from human neocortex, including models on their excitatory synapses, dendritic spines, dendritic NMDA- and somatic/axonal- Na+ spikes that provided new insights into signal processing and computational capabilities of these principal cells. Six human layer 2 and layer 3 pyramidal cells (HL2/L3 PCs) were modeled, integrating detailed anatomical and physiological data from both fresh and post mortem tissues from human temporal cortex. The models predicted particularly large AMPA- and NMDA- conductances per synaptic contact (0.88 nS and 1.31nS, respectively) and a steep dependence of the NMDA-conductance on voltage. These estimates were based on intracellular recordings from synaptically-connected HL2/L3 pairs, combined with extra-cellular current injections and use of synaptic blockers. A large dataset of high-resolution reconstructed HL2/L3 dendritic spines provided estimates for the EPSPs at the spine head (12.7 {+/-} 4.6 mV), spine base (9.7 {+/-} 5.0 mV) and soma (0.3 {+/-} 0.1 mV), and for the spine neck resistance (50 - 80 M{Omega}). Matching the shape and firing pattern of experimental somatic Na+-spikes provided estimates for the density of the somatic/axonal excitable membrane ion channels, predicting that 134 {+/-} 28 simultaneously activated HL2/L3- HL2/L3 synapses are required for generating (with 50% probability) a somatic Na+ spike. Dendritic NMDA spikes were triggered in the model when 20 {+/-} 10 excitatory spinous synapses were simultaneously activated on individual dendritic branches. The particularly large number of basal dendrites in HL2/L3 PCs and the distinctive cable elongation of their terminals imply that ~25 NMDA- spikes could be generated independently and simultaneously in these cells, as compared to ~14 in L2/3 PCs from the rat temporal cortex. These multi-sites nonlinear signals, together with the large (~30,000) excitatory synapses/cell, equip human L2/L3 PCs with enhanced computational capabilities. Our study provides the most comprehensive model of any human neuron to-date demonstrating the biophysical and computational distinctiveness of human cortical neurons.",

    "abstract": "Spatial or temporal aspects of neural organisation are known to be important indices of how cognition is organised. However, measurements and estimations are often noisy and many of the algorithms used are probabilistic, which in combination have been argued to limit studies exploring the neural basis of specific aspects of cognition. Focusing on static and dynamic functional connectivity estimations, we propose to leverage this variability to improve statistical efficiency in relating these estimations to behaviour. To achieve this goal, we use a procedure based on permutation testing that provides a way of combining the results from many individual tests that refer to the same hypothesis. This is needed when testing a measure whose value is obtained from a noisy process, which can be repeated multiple times, referred to as replications. Focusing on functional connectivity, this noisy process can be: (i) computational, e.g. when using an approximate inference algorithm for which different runs can produce different results or (ii) observational, if we have the capacity to acquire data multiple times, and the different acquired data sets can be considered noisy examples of some underlying truth. In both cases, we are not interested in the individual replications but on the unobserved process generating each replication. In this note, we show how results can be combined instead of choosing just one of the estimated models. Using both simulations and real data, we show the benefits of this approach in practice.",

In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to investigate the diversity of parvoviruses infecting wild and domestic animals in Brazil. We identified 21 parvovirus sequences (including twelve nearly complete genomes and nine partial genomes) in samples derived from rodents, bats, opossums, birds and cattle in Pernambuco, Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul states. These sequences were investigated using phylogenetic and distance-based approaches, and were thereby classified into eight parvovirus species (six of which have not been described previously), representing six distinct genera in the subfamily Parvovirinae. Our findings extend the known biogeographic range of previously characterized parvovirus species, and the known host range of three parvovirus genera (Dependovirus, Aveparvovirus, and Tetraparvovirus). Moreover, our investigation provides a window into the ecological dynamics of parvovirus infections in vertebrates, revealing that many parvovirus genera contain well-defined sub-lineages that circulate widely throughout the world within particular taxonomic groups of hosts.",

A handful of loci have been associated with GSD in populations of predominantly European ancestry, however they only explain a small portion of the population-attributable risk of the disease.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for GSD in 1,095 admixed Latinos with Mapuche Native American Ancestry, followed by a replication analysis of 10 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with suggestive genome-wide significance (P<1x10-5) in 1,643 individuals. Disease status was assessed by cholecystectomy or abdominal ultrasonography. Logistic regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, Type 2 Diabetes and Amerindian ancestry. Associated variants were further examined in two large GSD European populations and in a Chilean gallbladder cancer (GBC) cohort. We determined the expression levels of a novel GSD-candidate gene in normal and GSD-tissue samples.\\n\\nResultsWe consistently replicated the ABCG8 gene (rs11887534; P=3.24x10-8, OR=1.74) associated with GSD in admixed Latinos and identified a novel candidate signal within the TRAF3 gene on chromosome 14 (rs12882491; P=1.11x10-7, OR=1.40). ABCG8 and TRAF3 variants also conferred risk to GBC. Gene expression analyses indicated that TRAF3 levels were significantly decreased in the gallbladder (P=0.015) and the duodenal mucosa (P=0.001) of affected GSD individuals compared to healthy controls.\\n\\nConclusionsWe confirmed ABCG8 and identified TRAF3 both associated with GSD and GBC in admixed Latinos.

    "abstract": "Abnormalities in nucleic acid processing are associated with the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations in Matrin 3 (MATR3), a poorly understood DNA- and RNA-binding protein, cause familial ALS/FTD, and MATR3 pathology is a feature of sporadic disease, suggesting that MATR3 dysfunction is integrally linked to ALS pathogenesis. Using a primary neuron model to assess MATR3-mediated toxicity, we noted that neurons were bidirectionally vulnerable to MATR3 levels, with pathogenic MATR3 mutants displaying enhanced toxicity. MATR3s zinc finger domains partially modulated toxicity, but elimination of its RNA recognition motifs had no effect on neuronal survival, instead facilitating its self-assembly into liquid-like droplets. In contrast to other RNA-binding proteins associated with ALS, cytoplasmic MATR3 redistribution mitigated neurodegeneration, suggesting that nuclear MATR3 mediates toxicity. Our findings offer a foundation for understanding MATR3-related neurodegeneration and how nucleic acid binding functions, localization, and pathogenic mutations drive sporadic and familial disease.",

A newly identified tbl29/esk1 suppressor mutation affects the biosynthesis of strigolactones (SL) due to the reduced expression of the MAX4 gene. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that blocking the biosynthesis of SL is sufficient to recover all developmental and stress-related defects associated with the TBL29/ESK1 loss of function without affecting its direct effect - reduced wall O-acetylation. Altered levels of the MAX4 SL biosynthetic gene, reduced branch number, and higher levels of methyl carlactonoate, an active SL, were also found in tbl29/esk1 plants consistent with a constitutive activation of the SL pathway. These results indicate that the reduction of O-acetyl substituents in xylan is not directly responsible for the observed tbl29/esk1 phenotypes. Alternatively, plants may perceive defects in the structure of wall polymers and/or wall architecture activating the SL hormonal pathway as a compensatory mechanism.",

We investigated this paradigm during Arabidopsis lateral root formation when growth of the new primordia (LRP) from pericycle-derived stem cells deep inside the root is reportedly facilitated by remodeling of the walls of overlying cells without apparent cell death. However, we observed the induction of marker genes for cell types undergoing developmental cell death in several cells overlying the growing LRP. Transmission electron microscopy, time-lapse confocal and light sheet microscopy techniques were used to establish that cell death occurred at least in a subset of endodermal LRP-overlying cells during organ emergence. Significantly, organ emergence was retarded in mutants lacking a positive cell death regulator, and restored by inducing cell death in cells overlying LRP. Hence, we conclude that in the case of LRP, cell elimination contributes to organ growth.",

Previous studies unraveled three essential ion channels that regulate these parameters: 1) the Ca2+ channel CatSper, 2) the K+ channel KSper, and 3) the H+ channel Hv1. However, the molecular identity of an additional sperm Na+ conductance that mediates initial membrane depolarization and, thus, triggers downstream signaling events is yet to be defined. Here, we functionally characterize DSper, the Depolarizing Channel of Sperm, as the temperature-activated channel TRPV4. It is functionally expressed at both mRNA and protein levels, while other temperature-sensitive TRPV channels are not functional in human sperm. DSper currents are activated by warm temperatures and mediate cation conductance, that shares a pharmacological profile reminiscent of TRPV4. Together, these results suggest that TRPV4 activation triggers initial membrane depolarization, facilitating both CatSper and Hv1 gating and, consequently, sperm hyperactivation.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-specific loss-of-function (LOF) analysis is an essential approach for characterizing gene function. Here we describe an efficient CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis (CRISPR-TRiM) method for ablating gene function in Drosophila. This binary system consists of a tissue-specific Cas9 and a ubiquitously expressed multi-guide RNA (gRNA) transgene. To facilitate the construction of these components, we developed convenient tools for generating and evaluating enhancer-driven Cas9 lines, identified a multi-gRNA design that is highly efficient in mutagenizing somatic cells, and established an assay for testing the efficiency of multi-gRNAs in creating double-stranded breaks. We found that excision of genomic DNA induced by two gRNAs is infrequent in somatic cells, while indels more reliably cause tissue-specific LOF. Furthermore, we show that enhancer-driven Cas9 is less cytotoxic yet results in more complete gene removal than Gal4-driven Cas9 in larval neurons. Finally, we demonstrate that CRISPR-TRiM efficiently unmasks redundant gene functions in neuronal morphogenesis. Importantly, two Cas9 transgenes that turn on with different timings in the neuronal lineage revealed the extent to which gene products persist in cells after tissue-specific gene knockout. These CRISRPR tools can be applied to analyze tissue-specific gene function in many biological processes.",

    "abstract": "Yeast cells, like other higher eukaryotic cells, undergo a finite number of cell divisions before exiting the cell cycle due to the effects of aging. Here, we show that yeast aging begins with the nuclear exclusion of Hcm1 in young cells, resulting in loss of acidic vacuoles. Autophagy is required for healthy aging in yeast, with proteins targeted for turnover by autophagy directed to the vacuole. Consistent with this, vacuolar acidity is necessary for vacuolar function and yeast longevity. Using yeast genetics and immunofluorescence microscopy, we confirm that vacuolar acidity plays a critical role in cell health and lifespan, and is potentially maintained by a series of Forkhead Box (Fox) transcription factors. An interconnected transcriptional network involving the Fox proteins (Fkh1, Fkh2 and Hcm1) are required for transcription of v-ATPase subunits and vacuolar acidity. As cells age, Hcm1 is rapidly excluded from the nucleus in young cells, blocking the expression of Hcm1 targets (Fkh1 and Fkh2), leading to loss of v-ATPase gene expression, reduced vacuolar acidification, increased -syn-GFP vacuolar accumulation, and finally, diminished replicative lifespan (RLS). Loss of vacuolar acidity occurs about the same time as Hcm1 nuclear exclusion and is conserved; we have recently demonstrated that lysosomal alkalization similarly contributes to aging in C. elegans following a transition from progeny producing to post-reproductive life. Our data points to a molecular mechanism regulating vacuolar acidity that signals the end of RLS when acidification is lost.",

    "abstract": "An accurate and high-resolution genetic map is critical for mapping complex traits, yet the resolution of the current rat genetic map is far lower than human and mouse, and has not been updated since the original ensen-Seaman map in 2004. For the first time, we have refined the rat genetic map to sub-centimorgan (cM) r solution (<0.02 cM) by using 95,769 genetic markers and 870 informative meioses from a cohort of 528 heterogeneous stock (HS) rats. Global recombination rates in the revised sex-averaged map (0.66 cM/Mb) did not difeer compared to the historical map (0.65 cM/Mb); however, substantial refinement was made to the localization of highly recombinant regions within the revised map. Also for the first time, sex-specific rat genetic maps were generated, which revealed both genomewide and fine-scale variation in recombination rates between male and female rats. Reanalysis of multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) using the historical and refined rat genetic maps demonstrated marked changes to QTL localization, shape, and effect size. As a resource to the rat research community, we have provided revised centimorgan positions for all physical positions within the rat genome and commonly used genetic markers for trait mapping, including 44,828 SSLP markers and the RATDIV genotyping array. Collectively, this study provides a substantial improvement to the rat genetic map and an unprecedented resource for analysis of complex traits and recombination in the rat.",

    "abstract": "The degree to which an organism can affect its associated microbial communities (\\\"microbiome\\\") varies by organism and habitat, and in many cases is unknown. We address this question by analyzing the metabolically active bacteria of the maize phyllosphere across 300 diverse maize lines growing in a common environment. We performed comprehensive heritability analysis for 49 community diversity metrics, 380 bacterial clades (individual operational taxonomic units and higher-level groupings), and 9042 predicted metagenomic functions. We find that only a few few bacterial clades (5) and diversity metrics (2) are significantly heritable, while a much larger number of metabolic functions (200) are. Many of these associations appear to be driven by the amount of Methylobacteria present in each sample, and we find significant enrichment for traits relating to short-chain carbon metabolism, secretion, and nitrotoluene degradation. Genome-wide association analysis identifies a small number of associated loci for these heritable traits, including two loci (on maize chromosomes 7 and 10) that affect a large number of traits even after correcting for correlations among traits. This work is among the most comprehensive analyses of the maize phyllosphere to date. Our results indicate that while most of the maize phyllosphere composition is driven by environmental factors and/or stochastic founder events, a subset of bacterial taxa and metabolic functions is nonetheless significantly impacted by host plant genetics. Additional work will be needed to identify the exact nature of these interactions and what effects they may have on the phenotype of host plants.",

    "abstract": "Plant microtubules form a highly dynamic intracellular network with important roles for regulating cell division, cell proliferation and cell morphology. Its organization and dynamics are coordinated by various microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that integrate environmental and developmental stimuli to fine-tune and adjust cytoskeletal arrays. IQ67 DOMAIN (IQD) proteins recently emerged as a class of plant-specific MAPs with largely unknown functions. Here, using a reverse genetics approach, we characterize Arabidopsis IQD5 in terms of its expression domains, subcellular localization and biological functions. We show that IQD5 is expressed mostly in vegetative tissues, where it localizes to cortical microtubule arrays. Our phenotypic analysis of iqd5 loss-of-function lines reveals functions of IQD5 in pavement cell (PC) shape morphogenesis, as indicated by reduced interdigitation of neighboring cells in the leaf epidermis of iqd5 mutants. Histochemical analysis of cell wall composition further suggests reduced rates of cellulose deposition in anticlinal cell walls, which correlate with reduced asymmetric expansion. Lastly, we provide evidence for IQD5-dependent recruitment of calmodulin calcium sensors to cortical microtubule arrays. Our work thus identifies IQD5 as a novel player in PC shape regulation, and, for the first time, links calcium signaling to developmental processes that regulate multi-polar growth in PCs.\\n\\nHighlightMicrotubule-localized Arabidopsis IQ67 DOMAIN5 regulates pavement cell morphogenesis in the leaf epidermis and links calcium-calmodulin signaling to lobe initiation and asymmetric expansion during early phases of interdigitated cell growth.",

How bees transpose flight information to generate a corresponding walking (dance) behavior is still unknown. We now present a detailed study of the changes in dance duration of individual bees after shifting feeder distance. Our experiments indicated that most bees needed two or more foraging trips to the new position before showing an updated dance duration. In addition, only a few bees significantly changed dance duration immediately, whereas most bees first produced intermediary durations. Double shift experiments showed that under certain conditions bees do not update dance duration but continued to perform dance duration for the previously visited feeder position. We propose that generation of dance information involves two memory contents one for newly acquired and one for previously stored distance information.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryGeneration of dance information is temporally separated from immediate flight experience and involves two different memory contents.",

    "abstract": "Collective action dilemmas pervade the social and biological sciences - from human decision-making to bacterial quorum sensing. In these scenarios, individuals sense cues from the environment to adopt a suitable phenotype or change in behavior. However, when cues include signals from other individuals, then the appropriate behavior of each individual is linked. Here, we develop a framework to quantify the influence of information sharing on individual behavior in the context of two player coordination games. In this framework, the environment stochastically switches between two states, and the state determines which one of two actions players must coordinate on. Given a stochastically switching environment, we then consider two versions of the game that differ in the way players acquire information. In the first model, players independently sense private environmental cues, but do not communicate with each other. We find there are two types of strategies that emerge as Nash equilibria and fitness maximizers - players prefer to commit to one particular action when private information is poor, or prefer to employ phenotypic plasticity when it is good. The second model adds an additional layer of communication, where players share social cues as well. When the quality of social information is high, we find the socially optimal strategy is a novel \\\"majority logic\\\" strategy that bases decision-making on social cues. Our game-theoretic approach offers a principled way of investigating the role of communication in group decision-making under uncertain conditions.",

    "abstract": "The Patlak graphical method is widely used in parametric imaging for modeling irreversible radiotracer kinetics in dynamic PET. The net influx rate of radiotracer can be determined from the slope of the Patlak plot. The implementation of the standard Patlak method requires the knowledge of full-time input function from the injection time until the scan end time, which presents a challenge for use in the clinic. This paper proposes a new relative Patlak plot method that does not require early-time input function and therefore can be more efficient for parametric imaging. Theoretical analysis proves that the effect of early-time input function is a constant scaling factor on the Patlak slope estimation. Thus, the parametric image of the slope of the relative Patlak plot is related to the parametric image of standard Patlak slope by a global scaling factor. This theoretical finding has been further demonstrated by computer simulation and real patient data. The study indicates that parametric imaging of the relative Patlak slope can be used as a substitute of parametric imaging of standard Patlak slope for certain clinical tasks such as lesion detection and tumor volume segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Effective drug delivery is severely restricted by the presence of complex pathophysiological barriers in solid tumors. In human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, mature and hypopermeable tumor blood vessels limit the permeation and penetration of chemo or nanotherapeutics to cancer cells and substantially reduce the treatment efficacy. New, clinically-viable strategies are therefore sought to breach the neoplastic barriers that prevent optimal tumor-specific drug delivery. Here, we present an original idea to boost targeted drug delivery by selectively knocking down the tumor vascular barrier in a poorly permeable human pancreatic cancer model. For the first time, we demonstrate that clinical irradiation (10 Gy, 6 MV) can induce tumor vascular modulation when combined with tumor endothelial-targeting gold nanoparticles. Active disruption of tumor blood vessels by nanoparticle-combined radiotherapy led to increased vessel permeability and improved tumor uptake of two prototypical model nanodrugs: i) a short-circulating nanocarrier with MR-sensitive gadolinium (Gad-NC; 8 kDa; t1/2=1.5 h) and ii) a long-circulating nanocarrier with fluorescence-sensitive NIR dye (FL-NC; 30 kDa; t1/2=25 h). Functional changes in the altered tumor vessel dynamics, measured by relative changes in permeability (Ktrans), flux rate (Kep) and extracellular interstitial volume (Ve) were consistent with the concomitant increase in nanodrug delivery. This combination of radiation-induced antivascular and nanodrug-mediated anti-tumor treatment offers high therapeutic benefit for tumors with pathophysiology that restricts efficient drug delivery.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/268714_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (84K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a6df8borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19e3179org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c223aaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b3a08d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\\n\\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDetecting similar ligand-binding sites in globally unrelated proteins has a wide range of applications in modern drug discovery, including drug repurposing, the prediction of side effects, and drug-target interactions. Although a number of techniques to compare binding pockets have been developed, this problem still poses significant challenges.\\n\\nResultsWe evaluate the performance of three algorithms to calculate similarities between ligand-binding sites, APoc, SiteEngine, and G-LoSA. Our assessment considers not only the capabilities to identify similar pockets and to construct accurate local alignments, but also the dependence of these alignments on the sequence order. We point out certain drawbacks of previously compiled datasets, such as the inclusion of structurally similar proteins, leading to an overestimated performance. To address these issues, a rigorous procedure to prepare unbiased, high-quality benchmarking sets is proposed. Further, we conduct a comparative assessment of techniques directly aligning binding pockets to indirect strategies employing structure-based virtual screening with AutoDock Vina and rDock.\\n\\nConclusionsThorough benchmarks reveal that G-LoSA offers a fairly robust overall performance, whereas the accuracy of APoc and SiteEngine is satisfactory only against easy datasets. Moreover, combining various algorithms into a meta-predictor improves the performance of existing methods to detect similar binding sites in unrelated proteins by 5-10%.

    "abstract": "MotivationFor many biological systems, it is essential to capture simultaneously the function, structure, and dynamics in order to form a comprehensive understanding of underlying phenomena. The dynamical interaction between 3D genome spatial structure and transcriptional activity creates a genomic signature that we refer to as the four-dimensional organization of the nucleus, or 4D Nucleome (4DN). The study of 4DN requires assessment of genome-wide structure and gene expression as well as development of new approaches for data analysis.\\n\\nResultsWe propose a dynamic multilayer network approach to study the co-evolution of form and function in the 4D Nucleome. We model the dynamic biological system as a temporal network with node dynamics, where the network topology is captured by chromosome conformation (Hi-C), and the function of a node is measured by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Network-based approaches such as von Neumann graph entropy, network centrality, and multilayer network theory are applied to reveal universal patterns of the dynamic genome. Our model integrates knowledge of genome structure and gene expression along with temporal evolution and leads to a description of genome behavior on a system wide level. We illustrate the benefits of our model via a real biological dataset on MYOD1-mediated reprogramming of human fibroblasts into the myogenic lineage. We show that our methods enable better predictions on form-function relationships and refine our understanding on how cell dynamics change during cellular reprogramming.\\n\\nAvailability: The software is available upon request.\\n\\nContactindikar@umich.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSee Supplementary Material.",

E-hook deficient GFP-{beta}-tubulin normally incorporated into the axonemal microtubules; its transport frequency was reduced by ~90% in control cells and essentially abolished when expressed in a strain possessing IFT81 with an incapacitated tubulin-binding site.

    "abstract": "The grem1 gene codes a protein that inhibits the action of multiple members of a growth factor family known as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Certain members of this BMP family can regulate both fecundity and fertility in mammals via their action on oocyte (egg) development, and grem1 has been identified as a marker of oocyte quality in humans. The model amphibian Xenopus laevis is far more fecund than mammals, producing thousands of eggs in a clutch. However, female transgenic frogs carrying grem1 under the control of a stress inducible hsp70 promoter (\\\"G\\\" frogs) produce very few viable offspring. Here, we show that this is not due to reduced fecundity or fertilization rate, but results from a significant reduction in subsequent survival over the first day of development. Embryos that successfully survive for the first day were found to go on to develop normally when compared to their peers. Both the morphology and stage distribution of oocytes from G females appears normal, and oocytes develop at expected rates, although stage VI oocytes were found to have a lower response to in vitro progesterone treatment. Unexpectedly, levels of grem1 mRNA were found to be consistently lower in the female ovaries from four independent G transgenic lines than in wild type ovaries. Both transgenic and wild type offspring were equally affected, confirming a maternal effect. Our study shows that transgenic females with the lowest levels of grem1 transcripts in the ovary have the lowest rates of survival past the first day of amphibian embryogenesis, equivalent to pre-implantation staged mammalian embryos. The reduced expression of grem1 in the oocytes of transgenic females suggests transgene supression of an endogenous locus may occur in the Xenopus female germline, an unexpected finding.",

As a result, many available ecological forecasts are not based on the most up-to-date data, and the scientific progress of ecological forecasting models is slowed by a lack of feedback on how well the forecasts perform.\\nC_LIO_LIIterative near-term ecological forecasting involves repeated daily to annual scale forecasts of an ecological system as new data becomes available and regular assessment of the resulting forecasts. We demonstrate how automated iterative near-term forecasting systems for ecology can be constructed by building one to conduct monthly forecasts of rodent abundances at the Portal Project, a long-term study with over 40 years of monthly data. This system automates most aspects of the six stages of converting raw data into new forecasts: data collection, data sharing, data manipulation, modeling and forecasting, archiving, and presentation of the forecasts.\\nC_LIO_LIThe forecasting system uses R code for working with data, fitting models, making forecasts, and archiving and presenting these forecasts. The resulting pipeline is automated using continuous integration (a software development tool) to run the entire pipeline once a week. The cyberinfrastructure is designed for long-term maintainability and to allow the easy addition of new models.

    "abstract": "Late onset Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with more than 35 million people affected worldwide, and no curative treatment available. AD is highly heritable and recent genome-wide meta-analyses have identified over 20 genomic loci associated with AD, yet only explaining a small proportion of the genetic variance indicating that undiscovered loci exist. Here, we performed the largest genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 AD cases, 383,378 controls). AD-by-proxy status is based on parental AD diagnosis, and showed strong genetic correlation with AD (rg=0.81). Genetic meta analysis identified 29 risk loci, of which 9 are novel, and implicating 215 potential causative genes. Independent replication further supports these novel loci in AD. Associated genes are strongly expressed in immune-related tissues and cell types (spleen, liver and microglia). Furthermore, gene-set analyses indicate the genetic contribution of biological mechanisms involved in lipid-related processes and degradation of amyloid precursor proteins. We show strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomisation results suggest a protective effect of cognitive ability on AD risk. These results are a step forward in identifying more of the genetic factors that contribute to AD risk and add novel insights into the neurobiology of AD to guide new drug development.",

Here, we show that a human congenital heart defect, left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC), can be caused by a combination of rare, inherited heterozygous missense single nucleotide variants. Whole exome sequencing of a nuclear family revealed novel single nucleotide variants of MYH7 and MKL2 in an asymptomatic father while the offspring with severe childhood-onset LVNC harbored an additional missense variant in the cardiac transcription factor, NKX2-5, inherited from an unaffected mother. Mice bred to compound heterozygosity for the orthologous missense variants in Myh7 and Mkl2 had mild cardiac pathology; the additional inheritance of the Nkx2-5 variant yielded a more severe LVNC-like phenotype in triple compound heterozygotes. RNA sequencing identified genes associated with endothelial and myocardial development that were dysregulated in hearts from triple heterozygote mice and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes harboring the three variants, with evidence for NKX2-5s contribution as a modifier on the molecular level. These studies demonstrate that the deployment of efficient gene editing tools can provide experimental evidence for complex inheritance of human disease.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryA combination of three inherited heterozygous missense single nucleotide variants underlying a familial congenital heart defect.",

    "abstract": "ABSTARCTDespite centuries of research, much about the barbarian migrations that took place between the fourth and sixth centuries in Europe remains hotly debated. To better understand this key era that marks the dawn of modern European societies, we obtained ancient genomic DNA from 63 samples from two cemeteries (from Hungary and Northern Italy) that have been previously associated with the Longobards, a barbarian people that ruled large parts of Italy for over 200 years after invading from Pannonia in 568 CE. Our dense cemetery-based sampling revealed that each cemetery was primarily organized around one large pedigree, suggesting that biological relationships played an important role in these early Medieval societies. Moreover, we identified genetic structure in each cemetery involving at least two groups with different ancestry that were very distinct in terms of their funerary customs. Finally, our data was consistent with the proposed long-distance migration from Pannonia to Northern Italy.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to test for overlap in genetic influences between psychotic experience traits shown by adolescents in the community, and clinically-recognized psychiatric disorders in adulthood, specifically schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. The full spectra of psychotic experience domains, both in terms of their severity and type (positive, cognitive, and negative), were assessed using self- and parent-ratings in three European community samples aged 15-19 years (Final N incl. siblings = 6,297-10,098). A mega-genome-wide association study (mega-GWAS) for each psychotic experience domain was performed. SNP-heritability of each psychotic experience domain was estimated using genomic-relatedness-based restricted maximum-likelihood (GREML) and linkage disequilibrium-(LD-) score regression. Genetic overlap between specific psychotic experience domains and schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression was assessed using polygenic risk scoring (PRS) and LD-score regression. GREML returned SNP-heritability estimates of 3-9% for psychotic experience trait domains, with higher estimates for less skewed traits (Anhedonia, Cognitive Disorganization) than for more skewed traits (Paranoia and Hallucinations, Parent-rated Negative Symptoms). Mega-GWAS analysis identified one genome-wide significant association for Anhedonia within IDO2 but which did not replicate in an independent sample. PRS analysis revealed that the schizophrenia PRS significantly predicted all adolescent psychotic experience trait domains (Paranoia and Hallucinations only in non-zero scorers). The major depression PRS significantly predicted Anhedonia and Parent-rated Negative Symptoms in adolescence. Psychotic experiences during adolescence in the community show additive genetic effects and partly share genetic influences with clinically-recognized psychiatric disorders, specifically schizophrenia and major depression.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTransposable elements (TE) are an important source of evolutionary novelty in gene regulation. However, the mechanisms by which TEs contribute to gene expression are largely uncharacterized.\\n\\nResultsHere, we leverage Roadmap and GTEx data to investigate the association of TEs with active and repressed chromatin in 24 tissues. We find 112 human TE types enriched in active regions of the genome across tissues. SINEs and DNA transposons are the most frequently enriched classes, while LTRs are often enriched in a tissue-specific manner. We report across-tissue variability in TE enrichment in active regions. Genes with consistent expression across tissues are less likely to be associated with TE insertions. TE presence in repressed regions similarly follows tissue-specific patterns. Moreover, different TE classes correlate with different repressive marks: Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons (LTRs) and Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) are overrepresented in regions marked by H3K9me3, while the other TEs are more likely to overlap regions with H3K27me3. Young TEs are typically enriched in repressed regions and depleted in active regions. We detect multiple instances of TEs that are enriched in tissue-specific active regulatory regions. Such TEs contain binding sites for transcription factors that are master regulators for the given tissue. These TEs are enriched in intronic enhancers, and their tissue-specific enrichment correlates with tissue-specific variations in the expression of the nearest genes.\\n\\nConclusionsWe provide an integrated overview of the contribution of TEs to human gene regulation. Expanding previous analyses, we demonstrate that TEs can potentially contribute to the turnover of regulatory sequences in a tissue-specific fashion.",

Here, we have examined the function of MCE proteins in Salmonella Typhimurium during mammalian infection. We report that MCE proteins are required for Salmonella virulence, but that this is not related to decreased adherence, entry or survival in mammalian cells. Instead, we reveal that MCE proteins are required for Salmonella bile resistance, in particular to withstand bile salts such as cholate and deoxycholate. Based on our previous work in Escherichia coli, and other studies that have reported roles for MCE proteins in membrane biogenesis, we propose that Salmonella lacking MCE domains have a defective outer membrane that results in bile sensitivity and decreased virulence in vivo. These results suggest that MCE domains mediate fundamental aspects of bacterial membrane physiology as opposed to a proposed direct role in mammalian cell entry, explaining their conservation across both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal networks are surrounded by the extracellular matrix (ECM), which functions both as a scaffold and as a regulator of neuronal function. The ECM is in turn dynamically altered through the action of serine proteases, which break down its constituents. This pathway has been implicated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and of intrinsic excitability. Here, we determined the effects of acutely inhibiting two important regulators of the ECM, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator and Neuropsin, selectively and potently with the inhibitor UAMC-01162. Spontaneous electrophysiological activity was recorded from in vitro primary rat cortical cultures using microelectrode arrays. While inhibition at a low dosage had no significant effect, at elevated concentrations network bursting dynamics and functional connectivity were drastically altered. These results indicate that the serine protease inhibition affects neuronal and synaptic properties, likely through their actions on the ECM. We propose that in the acute phase, a transient increase of excitatory synaptic efficacy is compensated for by a downregulation of single-cell excitability.",

However, similar local activation patterns do not imply the same mesoscopic integration of brain regions active during imagery and perception or action. Here we present the first EEG evidence of topological equivalence between functional network organization at intermediate and global scales during tasks. We show that the degree of functional equivalence varies in the population and is associated with different magnitudes in the restructuring of the functional connectivity between imagery and real tasks. In particular, changes observed during imagery with respect to basal conditions account for the cognitive effort experienced during imagery, and subjects characterized by stronger functional equivalence exhibit smaller topological deviations in the imagination tasks performed after real tasks, thus showing learning effects. Altogether, our findings point to different sensori-cognitive information processing in the subjects showing different functional equivalence. We anticipate our results to be a starting point for a novel dynamical description of functional equivalence, which will be relevant for socio-cognitive theories of embodiment and cognitive formulations of how different selves emerge from neurophysiological assets.",

Crucially, we show that the tight precision of SO-SP coupling promotes memory consolidation in younger and older adults, and that brain integrity in source regions for the generation of SOs and SPs reinforces this beneficial SO-SP coupling in old age. Our results reveal age-related differences in SO-SP coupling in healthy elderly individuals.

    "abstract": "Understanding how groups of neurons interact within a network is a fundamental question in system neuroscience. Instead of passively observing the ongoing activity of a network, we can typically perturb its activity, either by external sensory stimulation or directly via techniques such as two-photon optogenetics. A natural question is how to use such perturbations to identify the connectivity of the network efficiently. Here we introduce a method to infer sparse connectivity graphs from in-vivo, two-photon imaging of population activity in response to external stimuli. A novel aspect of the work is the introduction of a recommended distribution, incrementally learned from the data, to optimally refine the inferred network.. Unlike existing system identification techniques, this \\\"active learning\\\" method automatically focuses its attention on key undiscovered areas of the network, instead of targeting global uncertainty indicators like parameter variance. We show how active learning leads to faster inference while, at the same time, provides confidence intervals for the network parameters. We present simulations on artificial small-world networks to validate the methods and apply the method to real data. Analysis of frequency of motifs recovered show that cortical networks are consistent with a small-world topology model.",

We assessed impulsivity, emotional dysregulation (ED) and amygdala functional connectivity in this DP.\\n\\nMethods. We recruited 69 participants divided into 4 groups: DP (n = 20), CD without BPD (n = 19), BPD without CD (n = 10) and healthy controls (HC, n = 20). We used self-reported instruments to measure impulsivity and ED. We acquired resting state fMRI and performed seed-based analyses of functional connectivity (FC) of bilateral amygdalas.\\n\\nResults. BPD and CD factors had opposing effects in impulsivity and ED, as well as on FC between left amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex. For the FC between right amygdala and left insula, the effect of having both disorders was additive, reducing FC strength. Significant FC clusters were correlated with impulsivity and ED.\\n\\nConclusions. In this preliminary study, we found that clinical scores of DP patients were closer to those of BPD without CD than to those of CD without BPD, while amygdala to medial prefrontal cortex FC patterns in DP patients were closer to HC than expected.",

    "abstract": "At any time, we are processing thousands of stimuli, but only few of them will be remembered hours or days later. Is there any way to predict which ones? Here, we show that the pupil response to ongoing stimuli, an indicator of physiological arousal, is a reliable predictor of long-term memory for these stimuli, over at least one day. Pupil dilation was tracked while participants performed visual and auditory encoding tasks. Memory was tested immediately after encoding and 24 hours later. Irrespective of the encoding modality, trial-by-trial variations in pupil dilation predicted which stimuli were recalled in the immediate and 24 hours-delayed tests. These results show that our eyes may provide a window into the formation of long-term memories. Furthermore, our findings underline the important role of central arousal systems in the rapid formation of memories in the brain, possibly by gating synaptic plasticity mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The hallmark of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is hepatocellular inflammation and injury in the setting of hepatic steatosis. Recent work has indicated that dynamic 18F-FDG PET with kinetic modeling has the potential to assess hepatic inflammation noninvasively, while static FDG-PET did not show a promise. Because the liver has dual blood supplies, kinetic modeling of dynamic liver PET data is challenging in human studies. This paper aims to identify the optimal dual-input kinetic modeling approach for dynamic FDG-PET of human liver inflammation. Fourteen patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were included. Each patient underwent 1-hour dynamic FDG-PET/CT scan and had liver biopsy within six weeks. Three models were tested for kinetic analysis: traditional two-tissue compartmental model with an image-derived single-blood input function (SBIF), model with population-based dual-blood input function (DBIF), and new model with optimization-derived DBIF through a joint estimation framework. The three models were compared using Akaike information criterion (AIC), F test and histopathologic inflammation score. Results showed that the optimization-derived DBIF model improved liver time activity curve fitting and achieved lower AIC values and higher F values than the SBIF and population-based DBIF models in all patients. The optimization-derived model significantly increased FDG K1 estimates by 101% and 27% as compared with traditional SBIF and population-based DBIF. K1 by the optimization-derived model was significantly associated with histopathologic grades of liver inflammation while the other two models did not provide a statistical significance. In conclusion, modeling of DBIF is critical for dynamic liver FDG-PET kinetic analysis in human studies. The optimization-derived DBIF model is more appropriate than SBIF and population-based DBIF for dynamic FDG-PET of liver inflammation.",

    "abstract": "An important aspect of cellular signaling networks is the existence of feedback mechanisms. However, due to the complexity of signaling networks, as well as the presence of multiple interrelated feedback events, it can be difficult to identify which signaling routes are active in any particular context. We have previously shown that Inference of Signaling Activity (ISA) can be a useful method to study steady-state oncogenic signaling across different cell lines and inhibitor treatments. However, ISA did not explicitly include feedback signaling events. Incorporating feedback will increase the complexity and computational cost of the model, and more data is likely to be needed to infer feedback activities. Here, we developed feedback-ISA (f-ISA), an extension of the ISA modeling approach which incorporates feedback signaling events. It also includes integrated batch correction in order to fit the models to multiple, independent datasets simultaneously. We find that the identifiability of feedback activities can be counter-intuitive, which shows the importance of analyzing the full, joint uncertainty in model parameters. By iteratively adapting the model and including multiple datasets, including both steady state and intervention data, we constructed a model that can explain a large part of the phosphorylation levels of several signaling molecules in the MAPK and AKT pathways, across many breast cancer cell lines and across various conditions. The resulting model delineates which routes in the signaling network are likely to be active in each cell line and condition, given all of the data. Additionally, such models can indicate whether datasets agree with each other, and identify which parts of the data cannot be explained, thereby highlighting gaps in the current knowledge. We conclude that this modeling approach can be useful to quantitatively understand how complex cellular signaling networks behave across different cell lines and conditions.",

In this work we explore the use of an Echo State Networks (ESN) based architecture for dynamical SSVEP detection.\\n\\nResultsWhen simulating a 6-degrees of freedom BCI system, an information transfer rate of 49bits/min was achieved.

However ESN and CCA approaches delivered diverse classification accuracies at subject level for various stimulation frequencies, proving to be complementary methods. A possible explanation of these results may be the occurrence of evoked responses of different nature, which are then detected by different approaches. While reservoir computing methods are able to detect complex dynamical patterns and/or complex synchronization among EEG channels, CCA exclusively captures stationary patterns. Therefore, the ESN-based approach may be used to extend the definition of steady-state response, considered so far a stationary process.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe present a novel SSVEP dynamical detection approach based on ESN.\\nC_LIO_LIThis is the first time ESNs are applied to SSVEP based BCI systems.\\nC_LIO_LIWe provide experimental validation of proposed methodology.\\nC_LIO_LIExperimental results indicate non-stationarity in SSVEP patterns.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEye movement during blinking can be a significant artifact in ERP analysis (mainly if ERP is blink-locked). Blinks produce a large positive potential in the vertical electrooculogram (VEOG), spreading towards posterior direction. Two methods are the most frequently used to suppress VEOGs: linear regression to subtract the VEOG signal from each EEG channel and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). However, both lose some EEG information.\\n\\nMethodsThe present algorithm (1) statistically identifies the time position of VEOGs in the frontopolar channels; (2) performs EEG averaging for each channel, which results in  blink templates; (3) subtracts each template from the respective EEG at each VEOG position, only when the linear correlation index between the template and the segment is greater than a threshold L. The signals from twenty subjects were acquired using a behavioral test and were treated using FilterBlink for subsequent ERP analysis. A model was designed to test the method for each subject using twenty copies of the EEG signal from the mid-central channel of the subject (which has almost no VEOG) representing each one of the 20 EEG channels and their respective blink templates. At the same 200 equidistant time points (marks), a signal (2.5 sinusoidal cycles at 1050 ms to emulate an ERP) was mixed with each model channel, along with the respective blink template of that channel, between 500 to 1200 ms after each mark.\\n\\nResultsAccording to the model, VEOGs interfered with both ERPs and the ongoing EEG mainly on the anterior medial leads, and no significant effect was observed on the mid-central channel (Cz). FilterBlink recovered approximately 90% (at Fp1) to 98% (Fz) of the original ERP and EEG signals to L of 0.1. In the analysis of real signals, the method reduced drastically the VEOG effect on the EEG after ERP and blink-artifact averaging.\\n\\nConclusionThe method is very simple and effective for VEOG attenuation without significant distortion of the EEG signal and embedded ERPs in all channels.",

    "abstract": "Tbx1, the major candidate gene for DiGeorge or 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, is required for efficient incorporation of cardiac progenitors (CPs) of the second heart field (SHF) into the heart. However, the mechanisms by which TBX1 regulates this process are still unclear. Here, we have used two independent models, mouse embryos and cultured cells, to define the role of TBX1 in establishing morphological and dynamic characteristics of SHF in the mouse. We found that loss of TBX1 impairs extra cellular matrix (ECM)-integrin-focal adhesion (FA) signaling in both models. Mosaic analysis in embryos showed that this function is non-cell autonomous and, in cultured cells, loss of TBX1 impairs cell migration and focal adhesions. Additionally, we found that ECM-mediated outside-in integrin signaling is disrupted upon loss of TBX1. Finally, we show that interfering with the ECM-integrin-FA axis between E8.5 and E9.5 in mouse embryos, corresponding to the time window within which TBX1 is required in the SHF, causes outflow tract dysmorphogenesis. Our results demonstrate that TBX1 is required to maintain the integrity of ECM-cell interactions in the SHF, and that this interaction is critical for cardiac outflow tract development. More broadly, our data identifies a novel TBX1 downstream pathway as an important player in SHF tissue architecture and cardiac morphogenesis.",

This has been interpreted as reflecting imprecise priors in a predictive coding system. However, this idea is not compatible with formation of overly strong beliefs and delusions in psychosis-associated states. A reconciliation of these paradoxical observations is that these individuals actively develop and use higher-order beliefs in order to interpret a chaotic environment. In the present behavioural and fMRI study, we compared delusion-prone individuals (n=20), a trait related to psychotic disorders, with controls (n=23; n=20 in fMRI-part) to study the effect of beliefs on fear learning. We show that instructed fear learning, involving explicit change of beliefs and an associated activation of lateral orbitofrontal cortex, is expressed to a higher degree in delusion-prone subjects. Our results suggest that strong high-level top-down learning co-exists with previously reported weak low-level bottom-up learning in psychosis-associated states.",

    "abstract": "Protein histidine methylation is rarely studied posttranslational modification of unknown biochemical importance. In vertebrates, only a few methylhistidne-containing proteins have been reported so far, including {beta}-actin as an essential example. The evolutionary conserved methylation of {beta}-actin H73 residue is catalyzed by a specific histidine N-methyltransferase that has never been identified molecularly. In the present investigation, we have purified actin-specific histidine N-methyltransferase from rat muscles about 1200-fold. Its activity was studied by the radiochemical assay employing either homogeneous recombinant human {beta}-actin produced in E. coli or its mutated form exhibiting substitution of H73 by Ala residue (H73A) as substrates. Three polypeptides of {approx}65, 75 and 90 kDa coeluting with the enzyme activity were identified in the preparation. Mass spectrometry analysis of these polypeptides resulted in the identification of SETD3 methyltransferase as the only plausible candidate. Rat SETD3 and its human ortholog were expressed in COS-7 cells, purified to homogeneity and shown to catalyze methylation of {beta}-actin at H73 residue as confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. The SETD3 enzyme was active towards a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 69-77 of {beta}-actin, but not to its mutated form exhibiting His-to-Ala substitution. Finally, Setd3-deficient HAP1 cells were devoid of methylated H73 in {beta}-actin and exhibited phenotypic changes, including a decrease in F-actin content and an increased glycolytic activity. We conclude that SETD3 is the actin-specific histidine N-methyltransferase. The data show for the first time the molecular identity of protein histidine N-methyltransferase in vertebrates and throw new light on the substrate specificity of SET-domain-containing enzymes.",

Here, we present the discovery of a HDAC6 ZnF-UBD-focused chemical series and its progression from virtual screening hits to low micromolar inhibitors. A carboxylate mimicking the C-terminal extremity of ubiquitin, and an extended aromatic system stacking with W1182 and R1155 are necessary for activity. One of the compounds induced a conformational remodeling of the binding site where the primary binding pocket opens-up onto a ligand-able secondary pocket that may be exploited to increase potency.

    "abstract": "piRNA-mediated repression of transposable elements (TE) in the germline limits the accumulation of heritable mutations caused by their transposition in the genome. It is not clear whether the piRNA pathway plays a functional role in adult, non-gonadal tissues in Drosophila melanogaster. To address this question, we first analyzed the small RNA content of adult Drosophila melanogaster heads. We found that varying amount of piRNA-sized, ping-pong positive molecules in heads correlates with contamination by gonadal tissue during RNA extraction, suggesting that most of piRNAs detected in head sequencing libraries originate from gonads. We next sequenced the heads of wild type and piwi mutants to address whether piwi loss of function would affect the low amount of piRNA-sized, ping-pong negative molecules that are still detected in heads hand-checked to avoid gonadal contamination. We find that loss of piwi does not affect significantly these 24-28 RNA molecules. Instead, we observe increased siRNA levels against the majority of Drosophila transposable element families. To determine the effect of this siRNA level change on transposon expression, we sequenced the transcriptome of wild type, piwi, dicer-2 and piwi, dicer-2 double-mutant fly heads. We find that RNA expression levels of the majority of TE families in piwi or dicer-2 mutants remain unchanged and that TE transcript abundance increases significantly only in piwi, dicer-2 double-mutants. These results lead us to suggest a dual-layer model for TE repression in adult somatic tissues. Piwi-mediated transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) established during embryogenesis constitutes the first layer of TE repression whereas Dicer-2-dependent siRNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) provide a backup mechanism to repress TEs that escape silencing by piwi-mediated TGS.",

    "abstract": "Methods to promote myelin regeneration in response to central myelin loss are essential to prevent the progression of clinical disability in demyelinating diseases. The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known to promote myelination during development via oligodendrocyte expressed TrkB receptors. Here, we use a structural mimetic of BDNF to promote myelin regeneration in a preclinical mouse model of central demyelination. We show that selective targeting of TrkB with the BDNF-mimetic enhances remyelination, increasing oligodendrocyte differentiation, the frequency of myelinated axons, and myelin sheath thickness after a demyelinating insult. Treatment with exogenous BDNF exerted an attenuated effect, increasing myelin sheath thickness only. Further, following conditional deletion of TrkB from pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes, we show the effects of the BDNF-mimetic on oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination are lost, indicating these are dependent on oligodendrocyte expression of TrkB. Overall, these studies demonstrate that targeting oligodendrocyte TrkB promotes in vivo remyelination in the brain.",
