    "abstract": "Despite the rapid development of sequencing technologies, assembly of mammalian-scale genomes into complete chromosomes remains one of the most challenging problems in bioinformatics. To help address this difficulty, we developed Ragout, a reference-assisted assembly tool that now works for large and complex genomes. Taking one or more target assemblies (generated from an NGS assembler) and one or multiple related reference genomes, Ragout infers the evolutionary relationships between the genomes and builds the final assemblies using a genome rearrangement approach. Using Ragout, we transformed NGS assemblies of 15 different Mus musculus and one Mus spretus genomes into sets of complete chromosomes, leaving less than 5% of sequence unlocalized per set. Various benchmarks, including PCR testing and realigning of long PacBio reads, suggest only a small number of structural errors in the final assemblies, comparable with direct assembly approaches. Additionally, we applied Ragout to Mus caroli and Mus pahari genomes, which exhibit karyotype-scale variations compared to other genomes from the Muridae family. Chromosome color maps confirmed most large-scale rearrangements that Ragout detected.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput data generation platforms, like mass-spectrometry, microarrays, and second-generation sequencing are susceptible to batch effects due to run-to-run variation in reagents, equipment, protocols, or personnel. Currently, batch correction methods are not commonly applied to microbiome sequencing datasets. In this paper, we compare different batch-correction methods applied to microbiome case-control studies. We introduce a model-free normalization procedure where features (i.e. bacterial taxa) in case samples are converted to percentiles of the equivalent features in control samples within a study prior to pooling data across studies. We look at how this percentile-normalization method compares to traditional meta-analysis methods for combining independent p-values and to limma and ComBat, widely used batch-correction models developed for RNA microarray data. Overall, we show that percentile-normalization is a simple, non-parametric approach for correcting batch effects and improving sensitivity in case-control meta-analyses.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBatch effects are obstacles to comparing results across studies. Traditional meta-analysis techniques for combining p-values from independent studies, like Fishers method, are effective but statistically conservative. If batch-effects can be corrected, then statistical tests can be performed on data pooled across studies, increasing sensitivity to detect differences between treatment groups. Here, we show how a simple, model-free approach corrects for batch effects in case-control microbiome datasets.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal exposure to maternal stress and depression has been identified as a risk factor for adverse behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes in early childhood. However, the molecular mechanisms through which maternal psychopathology shapes offspring development remain poorly understood. We applied transcriptome-wide screens to 149 umbilical cord blood samples from neonates born to mothers with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; n=20), depression (n=31) and PTSD with comorbid depression (n=13), compared to carefully matched trauma exposed controls (n=23) and healthy mothers (n=62). Analyses by maternal diagnoses revealed a clear pattern of gene expression signatures distinguishing neonates born to mothers with a history of psychopathology from those without. Co-expression network analysis identified distinct gene expression perturbations across maternal diagnoses, including two depression-related modules implicated in axon-guidance and mRNA stability, as well as two PTSD-related modules implicated in TNF signaling and cellular response to stress. Notably, these disease-related modules were enriched with brain-expressed genes and genetic risk loci for autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, which may imply a causal role for impaired developmental outcomes. These molecular alterations preceded changes in clinical measures at twenty-four months, including reductions in cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes in affected infants. Collectively, these findings indicate that prenatal exposure to maternal psychological distress induces neuronal, immunological and behavioral abnormalities in affected offspring and support the search for early biomarkers of exposures to adverse in utero environments and the classification of children at risk for impaired development.",

    "abstract": "The semi-aquatic bugs conquered water surfaces worldwide and occupy ponds, streams, lakes, mangroves, and even open oceans. As such, they inspired a range of scientific studies from ecology and evolution to developmental genetics and hydrodynamics of fluid locomotion. However, the lack of a representative water strider genome hinders thorough investigations of the mechanisms underlying the processes of adaptation and diversification in this group. Here we report the sequencing and manual annotation of the Gerris buenoi (G. buenoi) genome, the first water strider genome to be sequenced so far. G. buenoi genome is about 1 000Mb and the sequencing effort recovered 20 949 predicted protein-coding genes. Manual annotation uncovered a number of local (tandem and proximal) gene duplications and expansions of gene families known for their importance in a variety of processes associated with morphological and physiological adaptations to water surface lifestyle. These expansions affect key processes such as growth, vision, desiccation resistance, detoxification, olfaction and epigenetic components. Strikingly, the G. buenoi genome contains three Insulin Receptors, a unique case among metazoans, suggesting key changes in the rewiring and function of the insulin pathway. Other genomic changes include wavelength sensitivity shifts in opsin proteins likely in association with the requirements of vision in water habitats. Our findings suggest that local gene duplications might have had an important role during the evolution of water striders. These findings along with the G. buenoi genome open exciting research opportunities to understand adaptation and genome evolution of this unique hemimetabolous insect.",

The transcriptional profile showed global similarities to canonical cases. Coding lesions were predominantly clonal and almost entirely targeting alleles reported in human genetic variation databases with a notable exception in the mismatch repair gene, MSH2. There were no rare germline alleles or somatic mutations affecting proof-reading polymerase genes POLE or POLD1, however there was a predicted damaging mutation in the error prone replicative polymerase, POLK. The patients diagnostic leukemia transcriptome was depleted of rare and low-frequency germline alleles due to loss-of-heterozygosity, while somatic point mutations targeted low-frequency and common human alleles in proportions that offset this discrepancy. Somatic signatures of ultra-mutations were highly correlated with germline single nucleotide polymorphic sites indicating a common role for 5-methylcytosine deamination, DNA mismatch repair and DNA adducts.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data suggest similar molecular processes shaping population-scale human genome variation also underlies the rapid evolution of an infant ultra-mutated leukemia.",

We used HTS to obtain ancient DNA from the little bush moa (Anomalopteryx didiformis), one of the iconic species of large, flightless birds that became extinct following human settlement of New Zealand in the 13 th century. In addition to a complete mitochondrial genome at 249.9X depth of coverage, we recover almost 900 Mb of the moa nuclear genome by mapping reads to a high quality reference genome for the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae). This first nuclear genome assembly for moa covers approximately 75% of the 1.2 Gb emu reference with sequence contiguity sufficient to identify more than 85% of bird universal single-copy orthologs. From this assembly, we isolate 40 polymorphic microsatellites to serve as a community resource for future population-level studies in moa. We also compile data for a suite of candidate genes associated with vertebrate limb development and show that the wingless moa phenotype is likely not attributable to gene loss or pseudogenization among this candidate set.

    "abstract": "Modern microscopy modalities create a data deluge with gigabytes of data generated each second, and terabytes per day. Storing and processing these data is a severe bottleneck, not fully alleviated by data compression. We argue that this is because images are processed as regular grids of pixels. To address the root of the problem, we here propose a content-adaptive representation of fluorescence microscopy images called the Adaptive Particle Representation (APR). The APR replaces the regular grid of pixels with particles positioned according to image content. This overcomes storage bottlenecks, as data compression does, but additionally overcomes memory and processing bottlenecks, since the APR can directly be used in processing without going back to pixels. We present the ideas, concepts, and algorithms of the APR and validate them using noisy 3D image data. We show that the APR represents the content of an image while maintaining image quality. We then show that the adaptivity of the APR provides orders of magnitude benefits across a range of image processing tasks. Therefore, the APR provides a simple, extendable, and efficient content-aware representation of images that relaxes current data and processing bottlenecks.",

Moreover, annotation of both unmethylated and low methylated regions pointed to regulatory elements active in the inner ear in proximity of and distal from transcriptional units. Finally, we identified differentially methylated regions across the transition periods. An analysis of these regions led us to identify several novel candidate regulatory factors, connecting regulatory elements from specific time points in development to molecular features that drive the development and maturation of the inner ear sensory epithelium. The GJB6 locus putative regulatory region was shown to upregulate distal GJB6 gene expression and a non-coding RNA.\\n\\nConclusionsOur analysis of inner ear sensory epithelium DNA methylation sheds light on novel regulatory regions in the hearing organ, and may help boost diagnostic capabilities and guide the development of therapeutics for hearing loss, by providing multiple intervention points for manipulation of the auditory system.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer patient morbidity and mortality but due to persisting gaps in our knowledge, it remains untreatable. Metastases often occur as patients' tumors progress or recur after initial therapy. Tumor recurrence at the primary site may be driven by a cancer stem-like cell or tumor progenitor cell, while recurrence at a secondary site is driven by metastatic cancer stem cells or metastasis-initiating cells. Ongoing efforts are aimed at identifying and characterizing these stem-like cells driving recurrence and metastasis. One potential marker for the cancer stem-like cell subpopulation is CD117/c-kit, a tyrosine kinase receptor associated with cancer progression and normal stem cell maintenance. In our analyses, CD117 was expressed in several tissues and was highly expressed in bone marrow progenitor cells. Also, we uncovered that CD117 gene amplifications and mutations occurred in multiple cancers. Further, activation of CD117 by its ligand stem cell factor (SCF; kit ligand) in the progenitor cell niche stimulates several signaling pathways driving proliferation, survival, and migration. These signaling pathways were commonly altered in patients with CD117 amplifications and mutations. Here, we examine evidence that the SCF/CD117 signaling axis controls cancer progression through the regulation of stemness and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Activation of liver X receptors (LXRs) with synthetic agonists promotes reverse cholesterol transport and protects against atherosclerosis in mouse models. Most synthetic LXR agonists also cause marked hypertriglyceridemia by inducing the expression of SREBP1c and downstream genes that drive fatty acid biosynthesis. Recent studies demonstrated that desmosterol, an intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway that suppresses SREBP processing by binding to SCAP, also binds and activates LXRs and is the most abundant LXR ligand in macrophage foam cells. Here, we explore the potential of increasing endogenous desmosterol production or mimicking its activity as a means of inducing LXR activity while simultaneously suppressing SREBP1c induced hypertriglyceridemia. Unexpectedly, while desmosterol strongly activated LXR target genes and suppressed SREBP pathways in mouse and human macrophages, it had almost no activity in mouse or human hepatocytes in vitro. We further demonstrate that sterol-based selective modulators of LXRs have biochemical and transcriptional properties predicted of desmosterol mimetics and selectively regulate LXR function in macrophages in vitro and in vivo. These studies thereby reveal cell-specific discrimination of endogenous and synthetic regulators of LXRs and SREBPs, providing a molecular basis for dissociation of LXR functions in macrophages from those in liver that lead to hypertriglyceridemia.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe beneficial effects of LXR pathway activation in the prevention of atherosclerotic heart disease have long been appreciated. However, efforts to translate those effects in humans with synthetic LXR ligands has been met with the unintended consequence of hypertriglyceridemia, a product of co-activation of SREBP1c. Natural LXR ligands such as desmosterol do not promote hypertriglyceridemia because of coordinate down-regulation of the SREBP pathway. Here, we demonstrate that synthetic desmosterol mimetics activate LXR pathways macrophages both in vitro and in vivo without co-stimulation of SREBP1c. Unexpectedly, desmosterol and synthetic desmosterol mimetics almost no effect on LXR activity in hepatocytes in comparison to conventional synthetic LXR ligands. These findings reveal cell-specific differences in LXR responses to natural and synthetic ligands in macrophages and liver cells that provide a conceptually new basis for future drug development.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in genome editing have greatly improved knock-in (KI) efficiency1-9. Searching for factors to further improve KI efficiency for therapeutic use and generation of non-human primate (NHP) models, we found that the strand exchange protein RAD51 can significantly increase homozygous KI using CRISPR/Cas9 in mouse embryos through an interhomolog repair (IHR) mechanism. IHR is well-described in the context of meiosis10, but only occurs at low frequencies in mitotic cells11,12 and its existence in zygotes is controversial. Using a variety of approaches, we provide evidence for an endogenous IHR mechanism in zygotes that can be enhanced by RAD51. We show that this process can be harnessed for generating homozygous KI animals from wildtype zygotes based on exogenous donors and for converting heterozygous alleles into homozygous alleles without exogenous templates. Furthermore, we elucidate additional factors that contribute to zygotic IHR and identify a RAD51 mutant capable of insertion-deletion (indel)-free stimulation of IHR. Thus, our study provides conclusive evidence for the existence of zygotic IHR and demonstrates methods to enhance IHR for potential use in gene drives, gene therapy, and biotechnology.",

    "abstract": "Bromodomains are chromatin reader modules that recognize acetylated lysine. Different bromodomains exhibit a preference for specific patterns of lysine acetylation marks on core and variant histone proteins, however, the functional relationships that exist between histone acetyllysine ligands and bromodomain recognition remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined the ligand specificity of the ATAD2B bromodomain and compared it to its closely related paralog in ATAD2. We show that the ATAD2B bromodomain selects for mono- and di-acetylated histones, and structural analysis identified key residues in the acetyllysine binding pocket that dictate ligand binding specificity. The X-ray crystal structure of the ATAD2B bromodomain in complex with an ATAD2 bromodomain inhibitor was solved at 2.4 [A] resolution. This structure demonstrated that critical contacts required for bromodomain inhibitor coordination are conserved between the ATAD2/B bromodomains, and many of these residues play a dual role in acetyllysine recognition. We further characterized a variant of the ATAD2B bromodomain that through alternative splicing loses critical amino acids required for histone ligand and inhibitor coordination. Altogether our results outline the structural and functional features of the ATAD2B bromodomain and identify a novel mechanism important for regulating the interaction of the ATAD2B protein with chromatin.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe ATAD2B bromodomain recognizes mono- and di-acetylated histone ligands.\nC_LIO_LIChemical shift perturbations outline the ATAD2B bromodomain acetyllysine binding pocket.\nC_LIO_LIAn ATAD2B bromodomain-inhibitor complex reveals important binding contacts.\nC_LIO_LIAn alternate splice variant in the ATAD2B bromodomain abolishes histone and inhibitor binding.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Mesencephalic Astrocyte-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (MANF) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that can be secreted and protect dopamine neurons and cardiomyocytes from ER stress and apoptosis. The mechanism of action of extracellular MANF has long been elusive. From a genetic screen for mutants with abnormal ER stress response, we identified the gene Y54G2A.23 as the evolutionarily conserved C. elegans MANF orthologue. We find that MANF binds to the lipid sulfatide, also known as 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide present in serum and outer-cell membrane leaflets, directly in isolated forms and in reconstituted lipid micelles. Sulfatide binding promotes cellular MANF uptake and cytoprotection from hypoxia-induced cell death. Heightened ER stress responses of MANF-null C. elegans mutants and mammalian cells are alleviated by human MANF in a sulfatide-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate conserved roles of MANF in sulfatide binding and ER stress response, supporting sulfatide as a long-sought lipid mediator of MANFs cytoprotection.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged neurotransmitter release following synaptic stimulation extends the time window for postsynaptic neurons to respond to presynaptic activity. This can enhance excitability and increase synchrony of outputs, but the prevalence of this at normally highly synchronous synapses is unclear. We show that the postsynaptic channel, pannexin-1 (Panx1) regulates prolonged glutamate release onto CA1 neurons. Block of postsynaptic (CA1 neuronal) Panx1 increased the frequency of glutamate neurotransmission and action potentials in these neurons following Schaffer collateral stimulation. When Panx1 was blocked, anandamide levels increase and activated transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-mediated glutamate release. This TRPV1-induced synaptic acitvity enhanced excitability and translated into a faster rate of TRPV1-dependent epileptogenesis induced by kindling. We conclude that Panx1 facilitates AEA clearance to maintain synchronous release onto CA1 neurons so that when AEA clearance is reduced, TRPV1 channels prolong glutamate neurotransmission to enhance network output to promote epileptiform activity.",

    "abstract": "Birdsong is a classic example of a learned social behavior. Like many traits of interest, however, song production is also influenced by genetic factors and understanding the relative contributions of genetic and environmental influences remains a major research goal. In this study we take advantage of genetic variation among captive zebra finch populations to examine variation in a population-level song trait: song variability. We find that zebra finch populations differ in levels of song variability. Domesticated T. g. castanotis populations displayed higher song diversity than more recently wild-derived populations of both zebra finch subspecies T. g. castanotis and T. g. guttata, the Timor zebra finch. To determine whether these differences could have a genetic basis, we cross-fostered domesticated T. g. castanotis and Timor zebra finches to Bengalese finches Lonchura striata domestica. Following cross-fostering, domesticated T. g. castanotis maintained a higher level of song diversity than T. g. guttata. We suggest that the high song variability of domesticated zebra finches may be a consequence of reduced purifying selection acting on song traits. Intraspecific differences in the mechanisms underlying song variability therefore represent an untapped opportunity for probing the mechanisms of song learning and production.",

    "abstract": "Literature underpins research, providing the foundation for new ideas. But as the pace of science accelerates, many researchers struggle to stay current. To expedite their searches, some scientists leverage hypothesis generation (HG) systems, which can automatically inspect published papers to uncover novel implicit connections. With no foreseeable end to the driving pace of research, we expect these systems will become crucial for productive scientists, and later form the basis of intelligent automated discovery systems. Yet, many resort to expert analysis to validate such systems. This process is slow, hard to reproduce, and takes time away from other researchers. Therefore, we present a novel method to validate HG systems, which both scales to large validation sets and does not require expert input. We also introduce a number of new metrics to automatically identify plausible generated hypotheses. Through the study of published, highly cited, and noise predicates, we devise a validation challenge, which allows us to evaluate the performance of a HG system. Using an in-progress system, MOLIERE, as a case-study, we show the utility of our validation and ranking methods. So that others may reproduce our results, we provide our code, validation data, and results at bit.ly/2EtVshN.",

    "abstract": "Antler regeneration, a stem cell-based epimorphic process, has potential as a valuable model for regenerative medicine. A pool of antler stem cells (ASCs) for antler development is located in the antlerogenic periosteum (AP). However, whether this ASC pool is homogenous or heterogeneous has not been fully evaluated. In this study, we produced a comprehensive transcriptome dataset at the single-cell level for the ASCs based on the 10x Genomics platform (scRNA-seq). A total of 4,565 ASCs were sequenced and classified into a large cell cluster, indicating that the ASCs resident in the AP are likely to be a homogeneous population. The scRNA-seq data revealed that tumor-related genes were highly expressed in these homogeneous ASCs: i.e. TIMP1, TMSB10, LGALS1, FTH1, VIM, LOC110126017 and S100A4. Results of screening for stem cell markers suggest that the ASCs may be considered as a special type of stem cell between embryonic (CD9) and adult (CD29, CD90, NPM1 and VIM) stem cells. Our results provide the first comprehensive transcriptome analysis at the single-cell level for the ASCs, and identified only one major cell type resident in the AP and some key stem cell genes, which may hold the key to why antlers, the unique mammalian organ, can fully regenerate once lost.",

    "abstract": "Defects in the architecture or integrity of the nuclear envelope (NE) are associated with a variety of human diseases1. Micronuclei, one common nuclear aberration, are an origin for chromothripsis2,3, a catastrophic mutational process commonly observed in cancer genomes and other contexts4-6. Micronuclei have a defective NE, with the extensive chromosome fragmentation that generates chromothripsis occurring after abrupt, spontaneous loss of NE integrity7. After NE disruption, the exposed cytoplasmic DNA can additionally initiate proinflammatory signaling linked to senescence, metastasis, and the immune clearance of tumor cells8. Despite its broad physiological impact, the basis for the nuclear envelope fragility of micronuclei is unknown. Here we demonstrate that micronuclei undergo markedly defective NE assembly: Only \\\"core\\\" NE proteins9,10 assemble efficiently on lagging chromosomes whereas \\\"non-core\\\" NE proteins9,10, including nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), fail to properly assemble. Consequently, micronuclei have impaired nuclear import, and key nuclear proteins required to maintain the integrity of the NE and the genome fail to accumulate normally. We show that densely bundled spindle microtubules inhibit non-core NE assembly, leading to an irreversible NE assembly defect. Accordingly, experimental manipulations that position missegregated chromosomes away from the spindle correct defective NE assembly, prevent spontaneous NE disruption, and suppress DNA damage in micronuclei. Our findings indicate that chromosome segregation and NE assembly are only loosely coordinated through the timing of mitotic spindle disassembly. The absence of precise regulatory controls can explain why errors during mitotic exit are frequent, and a major trigger for catastrophic genome rearrangements5,6.",

Genome modification by recombineering using the phage lambda Red SynExo homologous recombination proteins Beta in Escherichia coli has approached 100% efficiency. While highly efficient in E. coli, recombineering using the Red SynExo in other organisms declines in efficiency roughly correlating with phylogenetic distance from E. coli. SynExo recombinases are common to double-stranded DNA viruses infecting a variety of organisms, including humans. Human Herpes virus Type 1 (HHV1) encodes a SynExo comprised of ICP8 synaptase and UL12 exonuclease.

Here we describe stimulation of gene targeting to edit a novel fluorescent protein gene in the human genome using ICP8 and compared its efficiency to that of a \\\"humanized\\\" version of Beta protein from phage {lambda}. ICP8 significantly enhanced gene targeting rates in HEK 293 T cells while Beta was not only unable to catalyze recombineering but inhibited gene targeting using endogenous recombination functions, despite both synaptases being well-expressed and localized to the nucleus.

Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) recombineering approaches 100% efficiency in E. coli using Beta protein from bacteriophage lambda, but recombineering has not been extended to eukaryotic genomes. Efficient recombineering requires SynExos that co-evolved with a viral host, however SynExos are common to viruses infecting a variety of organisms, including humans.

In this pioneering study, Herpes ICP8 stimulated gene targeting in a human genome by homologous recombination while the bacterial virus Beta protein inhibited recombination in human cells.

We show that the ITI indeed modulates rate and strength of aversive-learning, and that single-units in the primate amygdala and dorsal-anterior-cingulate-cortex signal confined periods within the ITI, strengthen this coding during acquisition of aversive-associations, and diminish during extinction. Additionally, pairs of amygdala-cingulate neurons synchronize during specific periods suggesting a shared circuit that maintains the long temporal gap. The results extend the known roles of this circuit and suggest a mechanism that maintains trial-structure and temporal-contingencies for learning.

    "abstract": "Our understanding of natural microbial communities is shaped by the careful investigation of a relatively small number of isolated and cultured organisms, and by analysis of genomic sequences obtained by culture-free metagenomic sequencing approaches. Metagenomic shotgun sequencing has facilitated partial reconstruction of strain-level community structure and functional repertoire. Unfortunately, it remains difficult to cost-effectively produce high quality genome drafts for individual microbes without isolation and culture. Recent molecular techniques that partition long DNA fragments and then barcode short fragments derived from them produce \\\"read clouds\\\", which are short-read sequences containing long-range information. Here, we present a novel application of a read cloud technique to microbiome samples, as well as Athena, a de novo assembler that uses these barcodes to produce improved metagenomic assemblies. We apply our approach to sequence human stool samples from two healthy individuals, and compare it to existing short read and synthetic long read metagenomic sequencing approaches. We find that read cloud metagenomic sequencing and Athena assembly produce the most complete individual genome drafts. These genome drafts are also highly contiguous (>200kb N50, <10 contigs), even for bacteria that have relatively low (20x) raw short read sequence coverage. We also apply this approach to a significantly more complex marine sediment sample and obtain 23 genome drafts with valuable 16S ribosomal RNA taxonomic marker sequences, nine of which are complete genome drafts. Read cloud metagenomic sequencing allows culture-free generation of high quality microbial genome drafts using only a single shotgun experiment.",

    "abstract": "SummaryGene-centric bioinformatics studies frequently involve calculation or extraction of various features of genes such as gene ID mapping, GC content calculation and different types of gene lengths, through manipulation of gene models that are often annotated in GTF format and available from ENSEMBL or GENCODE database. Such computation is essential for subsequent analysis such as intron retention detection where independent introns may need to be identified, converting RNA-seq read counts to FPKM where gene length is required, and obtaining flanking regions around transcription start sites. However, to our knowledge, a software package that is dedicated to analyzing various modes of gene models directly from GTF file is not publicly available. In this work, GTFtools (implemented in Python and not dependent on any non-python third-party software), a stand-alone command-line software that provides a set of functions to analyze various modes of gene models, is provided for facilitating routine bioinformatics studies where information about gene models needs to be calculated.\\n\\nAvailabilityGTFtools is freely available at www.genemine.org/gtftools.php\\n\\nContacthongdong@csu.edu.cn.",

    "abstract": "The 99 amino acid C-terminal fragment of Amyloid Precursor Protein APP-C99 (C99) is cleaved by {gamma}-secretase to form A{beta} peptide, which plays a critical role in the etiology of Alzheimers Disease (AD). The structure of C99 consists of a single transmembrane domain flanked by intra and intercellular domains. While the structure of the transmembrane domain has been well characterized, little is known about the structure of the flanking domains and their role in C99 processing by {gamma}-secretase. To gain insight into the structure of full-length C99, REMD simulations were performed for monomeric C99 in model membranes of varying thickness. We find equilibrium ensembles of C99 from simulation agree with experimentally-inferred residue insertion depths and protein backbone chemical shifts. In thin membranes, the transmembrane domain structure is correlated with extra-membrane structural states. Mean and variance of the transmembrane and G37G38 hinge angles are found to increase with thinning membrane. The N-terminus of C99 forms {beta}-strands that may seed aggregation of A{beta} on the membrane surface, promoting amyloid formation. The N-terminus, which forms -helices that interact with the nicastrin domain of {gamma}-secretase. The C-terminus of C99 becomes more -helical as the membrane thickens, forming structures that may be suitable for binding by cytoplasmic proteins, while C-terminal residues essential to cytotoxic function become -helical as the membrane thins. The heterogeneous but discrete extra-membrane domain states analyzed here open the path to new investigations of the role of C99 structure and membrane in amyloidogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Outside of the neurogenic niches of the brain, postmitotic neurons have not been found to undergo efficient regeneration. Here we demonstrate that Purkinje cells (PCs), which are born at midgestation and are crucial for both development and function of cerebellar circuits, are rapidly and fully regenerated following their ablation at birth. New PCs are produced by a previously unidentified progenitor population and support normal cerebellum development. The number of PC progenitors and their regenerative capacity, however, diminish soon after birth, and consequently PCs are poorly replenished when ablated at postnatal day 5. Nevertheless, the PC-depleted cerebella reach a normal size by increasing cell size, but scaling of neuron types is disrupted and cerebellar function is impaired. Our findings thus provide a new paradigm in the field of neuron regeneration by identifying a unipotent neural progenitor that buffers against perinatal brain injury in a stage-dependent process.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryInjury induces a dormant progenitor population present at birth to regenerate cerebellar neurons in a time-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Conservation of DNA sequence over evolutionary time is a strong indicator of function, and gain or loss of sequence conservation can be used to infer changes in function across a phylogeny. Changes in evolutionary rates on particular lineages in a phylogeny can indicate shared functional shifts, and thus can be used to detect genomic correlates of phenotypic convergence. However, existing methods do not allow easy detection of patterns of rate variation, which causes challenges for detecting convergent rate shifts or other complex evolutionary scenarios. Here we introduce PhyloAcc, a new Bayesian method to model substitution rate changes in conserved elements across a phylogeny. The method assumes several categories of substitution rate for each branch on the phylogenetic tree, estimates substitution rates per category, and detects changes of substitution rate as the posterior probability of a category switch. Simulations show that PhyloAcc can detect genomic regions with rate shifts in multiple target species better than previous methods and has a higher accuracy of reconstructing complex patterns of substitution rate changes than prevalent Bayesian relaxed clock models. We demonstrate the utility of PhyloAcc in two classic examples of convergent phenotypes: loss of flight in birds and the transition to marine life in mammals. In each case, our approach reveals numerous examples of conserved non-exonic elements with accelerations specific to the phenotypically convergent lineages. Our method is widely applicable to any set of conserved elements where multiple rate changes are expected on a phylogeny.",

    "abstract": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants is a common and often severe lung disease with long term sequelae. A genetic component is suspected but not fully defined. We performed an ancestry and genome-wide association study to identify variants, genes and pathways associated with survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia in 387 high-risk infants treated with inhaled nitric oxide in the Trial of Late Surfactant study. Global African genetic ancestry was associated with increased survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia among infants of maternal self-reported Hispanic White race/ethnicity (OR=4.5, p=0.01). Admixture mapping found suggestive outcome associations with local African ancestry at 18q21 and 10q22 among infants of maternal self-reported African American race/ethnicity. For all infants, the top individual variant identified was within the intron of NBL1, which is expressed in mid-trimester lung and is an antagonist of bone morphogenetic proteins (rs372271081, OR=0.17, p=7.4 x 10-7). The protective allele of this variant was significantly associated with lower nitric oxide metabolites in the urine of non-Hispanic white infants (p= 0.006), supporting a role in the racial differential response to nitric oxide. Interrogating genes upregulated in bronchopulmonary dysplasia lungs indicated association with variants in CCL18, a cytokine associated with fibrosis and interstitial lung disease, and pathway analyses implicated variation in genes involved in immune/inflammatory processes in response to infection and mechanical ventilation. Our results suggest that genetic variation related to lung development, drug metabolism, and immune response contribute to individual and racial/ethnic differences in respiratory outcomes following inhaled nitric oxide treatment of high-risk premature infants.",

    "abstract": "Many bacteria rely on the secretion of siderophores to scavenge iron from the environment. Laboratory studies revealed that abiotic and biotic factors together determine how much siderophores bacteria make, and whether siderophores can be exploited by non-producing cheaters or be deployed by producers to inhibit competitors. Here, we explore whether these insights apply to natural communities, by comparing the production of the siderophore pyoverdine among 930 Pseudomonas strains from 48 soil and pond communities. We found that pH, iron content, carbon concentration, and community diversity determine pyoverdine production levels, and the extent to which strains are either stimulated or inhibited by heterologous (non-self) pyoverdines. While pyoverdine non-producers occurred in both habitats, their prevalence was higher in soils. Environmental and genetic analysis suggest that non-producers can evolve as cheaters, exploiting heterologous pyoverdine, but also due to pyoverdine disuse in environments with increased iron availability. Overall, we found that environmental factors explained between-strain variation in pyoverdine production much better in soils than in ponds, presumably because high strain mixing in ponds prevents local adaption. Our study sheds light on the complexity of natural bacterial communities, and provides first insights into the multivariate nature of siderophore-based iron acquisition and competition among environmental pseudomonads.",

    "abstract": "Necrotic enteritis (NE) caused by Clostridium perfringens infection has reemerged as a prevalent poultry disease worldwide due to reduced usage of prophylactic antibiotics. The lack of alternative antimicrobial strategies to control this disease is mainly due to limited insight into NE pathogenesis, microbiome relationships, and host responses. Here we reported that the metabolic byproduct of microbial metabolism of bile acids to deoxycholic acid (DCA), at as low as 50 M, inhibited 82.8% of C. perfringens growth in Tryptic Soy Broth (P < 0.05). Sequential Eimeria maxima and C. perfringens challenge strongly induced NE, severe intestinal inflammation, and body weight (BW) loss in broiler chickens. These negative effects were diminished by 1.5 g/kg DCA diet. At the cellular level, DCA alleviated NE-associated ileal epithelial death and lamina propria immune cell apoptosis. Interestingly, DCA reduced C. perfringens invasion into villi without significantly altering the bacterial luminal colonization. Molecular analysis showed that DCA reduced inflammatory mediators of Inf{gamma}, Litaf (Tnf), Il1{beta}, and Mmp9 mRNA accumulation in ileal tissue. Mechanically, C. perfringens induced elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines of Inf{gamma}, Litaf, and Ptgs2 (COX-2 gene) in chicken splenocytes. Inhibiting the COX signaling by aspirin attenuated INF{gamma}- or TNFa-induced inflammatory response in the splenocytes. Consistently, chickens fed 0.12 g/kg aspirin diet resisted against NE-induced BW loss, ileal inflammation, and villus apoptosis. In conclusion, microbial metabolic product DCA prevents NE-induced BW loss and ileal inflammation through curbing inflammatory response. These novel findings could serve as a stepping-stone for developing next generation antimicrobial alternatives against NE.",

    "abstract": "Collodaria (Radiolaria) are important contributors to planktonic communities and biogeochemical processes (e.g. the biologic pump) in oligotrophic oceans. Similarly to corals, Collodaria live in symbiosis with dinoflagellate algae, a relationship that is thought to explain partly their ecological success. In the context of global change, the robustness of the symbiotic interaction and potential subsequent bleaching events are worth consideration. In the present study, we compared the ultrastructure morphology, symbiont density, photosynthetic capacities and respiration rates of colonial Collodaria exposed to a range of temperatures corresponding to natural conditions (21{degrees}C), moderate (25{degrees}C) and high (28{degrees}C) thermal stress. We showed that symbiont density immediately decreased when temperature rises to 25{degrees}C and the collodaria holobiont metabolic activity increased. When temperature reached 28{degrees}C, the collodarian host arrived at a tolerance threshold with a respiration nearly stopped and largely damaged morphological structures. Over the course of the experiment the photosynthetic capacities of remaining symbionts were stable, chloroplasts being the last degraded organelles from the microalgae. These results contribute to a better characterization and understanding of temperature-induced bleaching processes in planktonic photosymbiosis.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic transcriptional and epigenetic changes enable rapid adaptive benefit to environmental fluctuations. However, the underlying mechanisms and the extent to which this occurs are not well known. MutS Homolog 1 (MSH1) mutants cause heritable developmental phenotypes accompanied by modulation of defense, phytohormone, stress-response and circadian rhythm genes, as well as heritable changes in DNA methylation patterns. Consistent with gene expression changes, msh1 mutants display enhanced tolerance for abiotic stress including drought and salt stress, while showing increased susceptibility to freezing temperatures and bacterial pathogen P syringae. Our results suggest that chronic cold and low light stress (10 {degrees}C, 150 E) influences non-CG methylation to a greater degree in msh1 mutants compared to wild type Col-0. Furthermore, CHG changes are more closely pericentromeric, whereas CHH changes are generally more dispersed. This increased variation in non-CG methylation pattern does not significantly affect the msh1-derived enhanced growth behavior after mutants are crossed with isogenic wild type, reiterating the importance of CG methylation changes in msh1-derived enhanced vigor. These results indicate that msh1methylome is hyper-responsive to environmental stress in a manner distinct from the wild type response, but CG methylation changes are potentially responsible for growth vigor changes in the crossed progeny.",
