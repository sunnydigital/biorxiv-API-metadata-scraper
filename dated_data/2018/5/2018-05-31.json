    "abstract": "AimsPCSK9 inhibitors lower LDL cholesterol and are efficacious at reducing risk of vascular disease, however questions remain about potential adverse effects on cognitive function. We examined the association of LDL cholesterol-lowering genetic variants in PCSK9 with continuous measures of cognitive ability\\n\\nMethods and ResultsSix independent SNPs in PCSK9 were used in up to 337,348 individuals from the UK Biobank who underwent measures of cognitive ability (fluid reasoning, reaction time, trial making test and digit symbol coding. Scaled to a 50mg/dL lower LDL cholesterol, the PCSK9 allele score was associated with a lower risk of CHD (odds ratio 0.73; 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.90, P = 0.003). The scaled PCSK9 allele score nominally associated with worse log reaction time (0.04 standard deviations; 95%CI: 0.00, 0.08; P=0.038). Although no strong associations of the PCSK9 allele score were identified with any cognitive trait, the imprecision around the estimates meant that we could not exclude a similar magnitude of effect of genetic inhibition of PCSK9 to that seen with established risk factors, including APOEe4 or smoking status for any of the individual cognition traits. Point estimates for the PCSK9 allele score and cognition traits were all on the harmful side of unity.\\n\\nConclusionsUsing currently available data in UK Biobank, we are not able to rule out meaningful associations of PCSK9 genetic variants with cognition traits. These data highlight the need for further large-scale genetic analyses and, in parallel, continued pharmacovigilance for patients currently treated with PCSK9 inhibitors.",

All were subjected to RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, enterovirus 5\\\"-UTR- VP2 PCR assay and a modified VP1 snPCR assay. Both the 5-UTR - VP2 and VP1 amplicons were sequenced, isolates identified and subjected to phylogenetic analysis.\\n\\nTwenty of the 26 isolates analyzed were successfully identified. Altogether, 23 EV strains were recovered. Thesebelong to 11 EV (one EVA, nine EVB and one EVC) types which were EVA71 genotype C1 (1 strain), CVB3 (7 strains), CVB5 (1 strain), E5 (2 strain), E11 (3 strains), E13 (2 strain), E19 (1 strain), E20 (1 strain), E24 (2 strains), EVB75 (1 strain) and EVC99 (2 strains). Of the 11 EV types, the 5-UTR-VP2 assay identified seven while the VP1 assay identified 10. Both assays simultaneously detected 7 of the 11 EV types identified in this study with 100% congruence.\\n\\nIn this study we identified 20 of 26 samples that were previously untypable. In addition, we provided evidence that suggests that a clade of EVA71 genotype C1 might have been circulating in sub-Saharan Africa since 2008.

    "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by the functional decline of tissues. However, a systematic study of epigenomic and transcriptomic changes across tissues during aging is missing. Here we generated chromatin maps and transcriptomes from 4 tissues and one cell type from young, middle-age, and old mice, yielding 143 high-quality datasets. We focused specifically on chromatin marks linked to gene expression regulation and cell identity: histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), a mark enriched at promoters, and histone H3 acetylation at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), a mark enriched at active enhancers. Epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes could easily distinguish between ages, and machine learning analysis showed that specific epigenomic states could predict transcriptional changes during aging. Analysis of datasets from all tissues identified recurrent age-related chromatin and transcriptional changes in key processes, including the upregulation of immune system response pathways such as the interferon signaling pathway. The upregulation of interferon response pathway with age was accompanied by increased transcription of various endogenous retroviral sequences. Pathways deregulated during mouse aging across tissues, notably innate immune pathways, were also deregulated with aging in other vertebrate species - African turquoise killifish, rat, and humans - indicating common signatures of age across species. To date, our dataset represents the largest multi-tissue epigenomic and transcriptomic dataset for vertebrate aging. This resource identifies chromatin and transcriptional states that are characteristic of youthful tissues, which could be leveraged to restore aspects of youthful functionality to old tissues.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe neural architecture of executive functions remains a topic of considerable clinical and academic interest in the clinical neurosciences, given its strength as a transdiagnostic predictor of adaptive functioning with high heritability. In recent years, meta-analyses have shown a consistent relationship between prefrontal cortex size and executive functioning task performance in healthy adults and lesion patients, with increases in measures of cortical size (i.e., volume or thickness) associated with better executive functioning performance. There is a gap in meta-analytic literature assessing these relationships in neuropsychiatric populations, their effects relative to healthy controls, and differential contributions of brains regions and neuropsychological paradigms.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted a meta-analysis of published studies (k =30) that assessed the relationship between executive functions and frontal regions in vivo (N = 1935) for both healthy (20 samples) and neuropsychiatric (21 samples) adults. Random effects modeling was used to calculate mean effect sizes and CIs.\\n\\nResultsLarger volumes and thickness were associated with better executive functioning in both healthy (r =.35, 95% CI =.29 -.39) and neuropsychiatric populations (r =.47, 95% CI =.40 -.51), with the effect size for neuropsychiatric populations being significantly larger compared to healthy controls. While there was variability between tasks, there were no significant differences in effect size between neuropsychological paradigms or brain region classification.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results indicate the relationship between healthy adult performance on neuropsychological testing is less associated with cortical size compared to neuropsychiatric adults.",

    "abstract": "Head direction cells are critical for navigation because they convey information about which direction an animal is facing within an environment. To date, most studies on head direction encoding have been conducted on a horizontal two-dimensional (2D) plane, and little is known about how three-dimensional (3D) direction information is encoded in the brain despite humans and other animals living in a 3D world. Here, we investigated head direction encoding in the human brain while participants moved within a virtual 3D \\\"spaceship\\\" environment. Movement was not constrained to planes and instead participants could move along all three axes in volumetric space as if in zero gravity. Using functional MRI multivoxel pattern similarity analysis, we found evidence that the thalamus, particularly the anterior portion, and the subiculum encoded the horizontal component of 3D head direction (azimuth). In contrast, the retrosplenial cortex was significantly more sensitive to the vertical direction (pitch) than to the azimuth. Our results also indicated that vertical direction information in the retrosplenial cortex was significantly correlated with behavioural performance during a direction judgment task. Our findings represent the first evidence showing that the  classic head direction system that has been identified on a horizontal 2D plane also seems to encode vertical and horizontal heading in 3D space in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "For insects, chilling injuries that occur in the absence of freezing are often related to a systemic loss of ion and water balance that leads to extracellular hyperkalemia, cell depolarization, and the triggering of apoptotic signalling cascades. The ability of insect ionoregulatory organs (e.g. the Malpighian tubules) to maintain ion balance in the cold has been linked to improved chill tolerance, and many neuroendocrine factors are known to influence ion transport rates of these organs. Injection of micromolar doses of CAPA (an insect neuropeptide) have been previously demonstrated to improve Drosophila cold tolerance, but the mechanisms through which it impacts chill tolerance are unclear, and low doses of CAPA have been demonstrated to cause anti-diuresis in other insects, including dipterans. Here, we provide evidence that low (fM) and high ({micro}M) doses of CAPA impair and improve chill tolerance, respectively, via two different effects on Malpighian tubule ion and water transport. While low doses of CAPA are anti-diuretic, reduce tubule K+ clearance rates and reduce chill tolerance, high doses facilitate K+ clearance from the haemolymph and increase chill tolerance. By quantifying CAPA peptide levels in the central nervous system, we estimated the maximum achievable hormonal titres of CAPA, and found evidence to suggest that CAPA may function as an anti-diuretic peptide in Drosophila. We provide the first evidence of a neuropeptide that can negatively affect cold tolerance in an insect, and the first evidence of CAPA as an anti-diuretic peptide in this ubiquitous insect model.\\n\\nSummary StatementMany insects ion balance in the cold. We show how one neuropeptide can slow ion transport and reduce the cold tolerance of a fly.",

    "abstract": "The human dopamine transporter(hDAT) plays a major role in dopamine homeostasis and regulation of neurotransmission by clearing dopamine from the extracellular space using secondary active transport. Dopamine is an essential monoamine chemical messenger that regulates reward seeking behavior, motor control, hormonal release, and emotional response in humans. Psychostimulants such as cocaine primarily target the central binding site of hDAT and lock the transporter in an outward-facing conformation, thereby inhibiting dopamine reuptake. The inhibition of dopamine reuptake leads to accumulation of dopamine in the synapse causing heightened signaling. In addition, hDAT is implicated in various neurological disorders and disease-associated neurodegeneration. Despite its significance, the molecular architecture of hDAT and its various conformational states are poorly understood. Instability of hDAT in detergent micelles has been a limiting factor in its successful biochemical, biophysical, and structural characterization. To overcome this hurdle, first we identified ligands that stabilize hDAT in detergent micelles. Then, we screened [~]200 single residue mutants of hDAT using high-throughput scintillation proximity assay, and identified a thermostable variant(I248Y). Here we report a robust strategy to overexpress and successfully purify a thermostable variant of hDAT in an inhibitor and allosteric ligand bound conformation.",

    "abstract": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a secreted protein that plays an important role in regulating plasma cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk. PCSK9 secretion uniquely depends on the cytoplasmic COPII protein SEC24A, suggesting the presence of a transmembrane ER cargo receptor mediating this interaction. Here, we report a novel approach that combines proximity-dependent biotinylation and proteomics together with genome-scale CRISPR screening to identify proteins that facilitate the efficient secretion of PCSK9 heterologously expressed in HEK293T cells. We first identified 35 candidate proteins that were labeled by BirA* fusions to PCSK9 and either COPII component SAR1A or SAR1B. We then performed genome-scale pooled CRISPR mutagenesis to identify genes whose perturbation resulted in intracellular accumulation of PCSK9-eGFP but not the control A1AT-mCherry. The 4 most enriched sgRNAs in this screen all targeted SURF4, a homologue of the yeast endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cargo receptor Erv29p and the only candidate also identified by proximity-dependent biotinylation. The functional contribution of SURF4 to PCSK9 secretion was confirmed with multiple independent SURF4-targeting sgRNAs, clonal SURF4-deficient cell lines, and functional rescue with SURF4 cDNA. Compatible with a function of SURF4 as a cargo receptor for PCSK9, fluorescence microscopy localized SURF4 to the early secretory pathway, coimmunoprecipitation revealed a physical interaction between SURF4 and PCSK9, and SURF4 deletion resulted in decreased extracellular secretion of PCSK9 and PCSK9 accumulation in the ER. Taken together, these findings support a model in which SURF4 functions as an ER cargo receptor for the efficient cellular secretion of PCSK9.",

Using stripe 2 of the even-skipped gene in Drosophila embryos as a case study, we dissect the regulatory forces underpinning a key step along the developmental decision-making cascade: the generation of cytoplasmic mRNA patterns via the control of transcription in individual cells. Using live imaging and computational approaches, we found that the transcriptional burst frequency is modulated across the stripe to control the mRNA production rate. However, we discovered that bursting alone cannot quantitatively recapitulate the formation of the stripe, and that control of the window of time over which each nucleus transcribes even-skipped plays a critical role in stripe formation. Theoretical modeling revealed that these regulatory strategies--bursting and the time window--obey different kinds of regulatory logic, suggesting that the stripe is shaped by the interplay of two distinct underlying molecular processes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding pathogen outbreak and emergence events has important implications to the management of infectious disease. Apart from preempting infectious disease events, there is considerable interest in determining why certain pathogens are consistently found in some regions, and why others spontaneously emerge or reemerge over time. Here, we use a trait-free approach which leverages information on the global community of human infectious diseases to estimate the potential for pathogen outbreak, emergence, and re-emergence events over time. Our approach uses pairwise dissimilarities among pathogen distributions between countries and country-level pathogen composition to quantify pathogen outbreak, emergence, and re-emergence potential as a function of time (e.g., number of years between training and prediction), pathogen type (e.g., virus), and transmission mode (e.g., vector-borne). We find that while outbreak and re-emergence potential are well captured by our simple model, prediction of emergence events remains elusive, and sudden global emergences like an influenza pandemic seem beyond the predictive capacity of the model. While our approach allows for dynamic predictability of outbreak and re-emergence events, data deficiencies and the stochastic nature of emergence events may preclude accurate prediction. Together, our results make a compelling case for incorporating a community ecological perspective into existing disease forecasting efforts.",

    "abstract": "Population-scale genomic datasets have given researchers incredible amounts of information from which to infer evolutionary histories. Concomitant with this flood of data, theoretical and methodological advances have sought to extract information from genomic sequences to infer demographic events such as population size changes and gene flow among closely related populations/species, construct recombination maps, and uncover loci underlying recent adaptation. To date most methods make use of only one or a few summaries of the input sequences and therefore ignore potentially useful information encoded in the data. The most sophisticated of these approaches involve likelihood calculations, which require theoretical advances for each new problem, and often focus on a single aspect of the data (e.g. only allele frequency information) in the interest of mathematical and computational tractability. Directly interrogating the entirety of the input sequence data in a likelihood-free manner would thus offer a fruitful alternative. Here we accomplish this by representing DNA sequence alignments as images and using a class of deep learning methods called convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to make population genetic inferences from these images. We apply CNNs to a number of evolutionary questions and find that they frequently match or exceed the accuracy of current methods. Importantly, we show that CNNs perform accurate evolutionary model selection and parameter estimation, even on problems that have not received detailed theoretical treatments. Thus, when applied to population genetic alignments, CNN are capable of outperforming expert-derived statistical methods, and offer a new path forward in cases where no likelihood approach exists.",

    "abstract": "Older adults who report more sleep problems tend to have elevated levels of the Alzheimers disease (AD) biomarker {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}), but the mechanisms responsible for this relationship are largely unknown. Molecular markers of sleep problems are now emerging from rodent research, yielding opportunities to generate hypotheses about the causes of the sleep-A{beta} relationship. A major molecular marker of sleep deprivation is Homer1a, a neural protein coded by the HOMER1 gene, involved in control of sleep homeostasis and also implied in A{beta} accumulation. Here, in a sample of 109 cognitively healthy middle-aged and older adults, we tested whether the relationship between cortical A{beta} accumulation and self-reported sleep quality, as well as changes in sleep quality over three years, was stronger in cortical regions with high HOMER1 mRNA expression levels. A{beta} correlated with poorer sleep quality cross-sectionally and longitudinally. This relationship was stronger in the younger (50-67 years) than the older (68-81 years) participants. Effects were mainly found in regions with high expression of HOMER1, suggesting a possible molecular pathway between sleep problems and A{beta} accumulation. The anatomical distribution of the sleep-A{beta} relationships followed closely the A{beta} accumulation pattern in 69 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. Thus, the results indicate that the relationship between sleep problems and A{beta}-accumulation may involve Homer1 activity in the cortical regions that harbor A{beta} in AD. Analysis of cortical gene expression patterns represent a promising avenue to unveil molecular mechanisms behind the relationship between sleep problems and AD risk.",

The lack of quantitative models precludes understanding of how cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions regulate tissue-scale force transmission to guide morphogenic processes. We integrate biophysical measurements on model epithelial tissues and computational modelling to explore how cell-level dynamics alter mechanical stress organization at multicellular scales. We show that traction stress distribution in epithelial colonies can vary widely for identical geometries. For colonies with peripheral localization of traction stresses, we recapitulate previously described mechanical behavior of cohesive tissues with a continuum model. By contrast, highly motile cells within colonies produce traction stresses that fluctuate in space and time. To predict the traction force dynamics, we introduce an Active Adherent Vertex Model (AAVM) for epithelial monolayers. AAVM predicts that increased cellular motility and reduced intercellular mechanical coupling localize traction stresses in the colony interior, in agreement with our experimental data. Furthermore, the model captures a wide spectrum of localized stress production modes that arise from individual cell activities including cell division, rotation, and polarized migration. This approach provides a robust quantitative framework to study how cell-scale dynamics influence force transmission in epithelial tissues.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-resident macrophages comprise the most abundant immune cell population in healthy adipose tissue. Adipose tissue macrophage populations change during metabolic stress and ageing, and are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity. Here, we studied adipose tissue macrophage subpopulations in the steady state, and in response to nutritional and infectious challenges.\\n\\nUsing comprehensive cell-surface-based and gene expression analyses, we found that tissue-resident macrophages from healthy epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) tightly associate with blood vessels, displaying a very high endocytic capacity. We refer to these cells as Vasculature-associated Adipose tissue Macrophages (VAMs). Chronic high fat diet (HFD) feeding results in the accumulation of a monocyte-derived CD11c+CD64+ double positive (DP) macrophage eWAT population with a predominant anti-inflammatory gene profile, but reduced endocytic function. In contrast, fasting rapidly and reversibly leads to VAM depletion, while acute inflammatory stress induced by pathogens transiently depletes VAMs and simultaneously boosts DP macrophage accumulation. Our results indicate that adipose tissue macrophage populations adapt to metabolic stress and inflammation, suggesting an important role for these cells in restoring homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Cryptosporidiosis in an enteric infection caused by Cryptosporidium parasites and is a major cause of acute infant diarrhea in the developing world. A major bottleneck to research progress is the lack of methods to cryopreserve Cryptosporidium oocysts, thus requiring routine propagation in laboratory animals. Here, we report a method to cryopreserve C. parvum oocysts by ultra-fast cooling. Cryopreserved oocysts exhibits high viability and robust in vitro excystation, and are infectious to interferon-{gamma} knockout mice. The course of the infection is comparable to what we observe with unfrozen oocysts. Oocyst viability and infectivity is not visibly changed after several weeks of cryogenic storage. Cryopreservation will facilitate the sharing of oocysts from well characterized isolates and transgenic strains among different laboratories.",

    "abstract": "PurposeWe investigated the impact of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) on visual acuity and the visual white matter.\\n\\nMethodsWe combined an adaptive cortical atlas and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and tractography to separate optic radiation (OR) projections to different retinal eccentricities in human primary visual cortex. We exploited the known anatomical organization of the OR and clinically relevant data to segment the OR into three primary components projecting to fovea, mid- and far-periphery. We measured white matter tissue properties - (fractional anisotropy, linearity, planarity, sphericity) along the aforementioned three components of the optic radiation to compare AMD patients and controls.\\n\\nResultsWe found differences in white matter properties specific to OR white matter fascicles projecting to primary visual cortex locations corresponding to the location of retinal damage (fovea). Additionally, we show that the magnitude of white matter properties in AMD patients correlates with visual acuity. In sum, we demonstrate a specific relation between visual loss, anatomical location of retinal damage and white matter damage in AMD patients. Importantly, we demonstrate that these changes are so profound that can be detected using magnetic resonance imaging data with clinical resolution. The conserved mapping between retinal and white matter damage suggests that retinal neurodegeneration might be a primary cause of white matter degeneration in AMD patients.\\n\\nConclusionsThe results highlight the impact of eye disease on brain tissue, a process that may become an important target to monitor during the course of treatment.",

    "abstract": "If a transgene is effectively delivered to a cell, its expression may still be limited by epigenetic mechanisms that silence the transgene. Indeed, once the transgene reaches the nucleus, it may be bound by histone proteins and condensed into heterochromatin or associated with repressor proteins that block transcription. In this study, we sought to enhance transgene expression by adding binding motifs for several different epigenetic enzymes either upstream or downstream of two promoters (CMV and EF1). Screening these plasmids revealed that luciferase expression was enhanced 10-fold by the addition of a CCAAT box just upstream of the EF1 promoter to recruit nuclear transcription factor Y (NF-Y), while inserting a CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) motif downstream of the EF1 promoter enhanced expression 14-fold (14.03 {+/-} 6.54). ChIP assays confirmed that NF-Y and CTCF bound to the motifs that were added to each plasmid, but the presence of NF-Y and CTCF did not significantly affect the levels of histone acetylation (H3K9ac). Overall, these result show that transgene expression from the EF1 promoter can be significantly increased with motifs that recruit NF-Y or CTCF.",

    "abstract": "Orthogonal confirmation of NGS-detected germline variants has been standard practice, although published studies have suggested that confirmation of the highest quality calls may not always be necessary. The key question is how laboratories can establish criteria that consistently identify those NGS calls that require confirmation. Most prior studies addressing this question have limitations: These studies are generally small, omit statistical justification, and explore limited aspects of the underlying data. The rigorous definition of criteria that separate high-accuracy NGS calls from those that may or may not be true remains a critical issue.\\n\\nWe analyzed five reference samples and over 80,000 patient specimens from two laboratories. We examined quality metrics for approximately 200,000 NGS calls with orthogonal data, including 1662 false positives. A classification algorithm used these data to identify a battery of criteria that flag 100% of false positives as requiring confirmation (CI lower bound: 98.5-99.8% depending on variant type) while minimizing the number of flagged true positives. These criteria identify false positives that the previously published criteria miss. Sampling analysis showed that smaller datasets resulted in less effective criteria.\\n\\nOur methodology for determining test and laboratory-specific criteria can be generalized into a practical approach that can be used by many laboratories to help reduce the cost and time burden of confirmation without impacting clinical accuracy.",

    "abstract": "What is the relationship between language and complex thought? In the context of deductive reasoning there are two main views. Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.",

    "abstract": "The health impacts of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) remain debated and their tissue and molecular targets are poorly understood. Here we leveraged systems biology approaches to assess the target tissues, molecular pathways, and gene regulatory networks associated with prenatal exposure to the model EDC Bisphenol A (BPA). Prenatal BPA exposure led to scores of transcriptomic and methylomic alterations in the adipose, hypothalamus, and liver tissues in mouse offspring, with cross-tissue perturbations in lipid metabolism as well as tissue-specific alterations in histone subunits, glucose metabolism and extracellular matrix. Network modeling prioritized main molecular targets of BPA, including Pparg, Hnf4a, Esr1, and Fasn. Lastly, integrative analyses identified the association of BPA molecular signatures with cardiometabolic phenotypes in mouse and human. Our multi-tissue, multi-omics investigation provides strong evidence that BPA perturbs diverse molecular networks in central and peripheral tissues, and offers insights into the molecular targets that link BPA to human cardiometabolic disorders.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe inability to pinpoint the mechanistic underpinnings of environmentally-induced diseases likely stems from the pleiotropic effects of chemicals such as BPA on diverse tissues and molecular space (transcriptome, epigenome, etc.). This makes it challenging to fully dissect their health impact and merits a call for modern big data approaches to examine environmental factors. Our data-driven study is the first unbiased, multi-tissue multiomic systems biology investigation of the molecular circuitry and mechanisms underlying offspring response to prenatal BPA exposure. Importantly, the incorporation of network-based modeling allows us to capture novel players in the regulation of BPA activities in vivo, and the integration with human disease association datasets helps bridge the molecular pathways affected by BPA with diverse human diseases. In doing so, our study provides compelling molecular evidence that developmental BPA exposure significantly perturbs metabolic and endocrine systems in the offspring, and supports BPA as one of the environmental factors involved in the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD).",
