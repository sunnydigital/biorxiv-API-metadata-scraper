    "abstract": "Background: Among the four bases, guanine is the most susceptible to damage from oxidative stress. Replication of DNA containing damaged guanines result in G to T mutations. Therefore, the mutations resulting from oxidative DNA damage are generally expected to predominantly consist of G to T (and C to A when the damaged guanine is not in the reference strand) and result in decreased GC content. However, the opposite pattern was reported 16 years ago in a study of prokaryotic genomes. Although that result has been widely cited and confirmed by nine later studies with similar methods, the omission of the effect of shared ancestry requires a re-examination of the reliability of the results.\\n\\nResults: We retrieved 70 aerobe-anaerobe pairs of prokaryotes, and members of each pair were adjacent on the phylogenetic tree. Pairwise comparisons of either whole-genome GC content or the GC content at 4-fold degenerate sites of orthologous genes among these 70 pairs did not show significant differences between aerobes and anaerobes. The signature of guanine oxidation on GC content evolution has not been detected even after extensive controlling of other influencing factors. Furthermore, the anaerobes were not different from the aerobes in the rate of either G to T, C to A, or other directions of substitutions. The presence of the enzymes responsible for guanine oxidation in anaerobic prokaryotes provided additional evidence that guanine oxidation might be prevalent in anaerobic prokaryotes. In either aerobes or anaerobes, the rates of G:C to T:A mutations were not significantly higher than the reverse mutations.\\n\\nConclusions: The previous counterintuitive results on the relationship between oxygen requirement and GC content should be attributed to the methodological artefact resulting from phylogenetically non-independence among the analysed samples. Our results showed that aerobiosis does not increase or decrease GC content in evolution. Furthermore, our study challenged the widespread belief that abundant G:C to T:A transversions are the signature of oxidative stress in prokaryotic evolution.",

    "abstract": "The inflammatory response, modulated both by tissue resident macrophages and recruited monocytes from peripheral blood, plays a critical role in human diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we sought a model to interrogate human immune behavior in vivo. We determined that primary human monocytes and macrophages survive in zebrafish for up to two weeks. Flow cytometry revealed that human monocytes cultured at the physiological temperature of the zebrafish survive and differentiate comparable to cohorts cultured at human physiological temperature. Moreover, key genes that encode for proteins that play a role in tissue remodeling were also expressed. Human cells migrated within multiple tissues at speeds comparable to zebrafish macrophages. Analysis of gene expression of in vivo educated human macrophages confirmed expression of activated macrophage phenotypes. Here, human cells adopted phenotypes relevant to cancer progression, suggesting that we can define the real time immune modulation of human tumor cells during the establishment of a metastatic lesion in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Several fMRI and EEG studies have demonstrated that successful episodic retrieval is accompanied by the reactivation of cortical regions that were active during encoding. These findings are consistent with influential models of episodic memory that posit that conscious retrieval (recollection) relies on hippocampally-mediated cortical reinstatement. Evidence of reactivation corresponding to episodic information that is beyond conscious awareness at the time of memory retrieval, however, is limited. A recent exception is from an EEG study by Wimber, Maa{beta}, Staudigl, Richardson-Klavehn, and Hanslmayr (2012) in which words were encoded in the context of highly salient visual flicker entrainment and then presented at retrieval in the absence of any flicker. In that study, coherent (phase-locked) neural activity was observed at the corresponding entrained frequencies during retrieval, consistent with the notion that encoding representations were reactivated. Given the important implications of unconscious reactivation to past findings and the modeling literature, the current study set out to provide a direct replication of the previous study. Additionally, an attempt was made to extend such findings to intentional retrieval by acquiring EEG while subjects were explicitly asked to make memory judgments about the flicker frequency from encoding. Throughout a comprehensive set of analyses, the current study consistently failed to demonstrate evidence for unconscious reactivation, and instead provided support that test items were indistinguishable according to their prior encoding context. The findings thus establish an important boundary condition for the involvement of cortical reinstatement in episodic memory.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming extensively occurs in proliferating cancer cells. This phenomenon occurs highly heterogeneously, but its origin has remained unclear. Here we use a physicochemical concept of free electron potential (FEP) and its equation of state to profile metabolites. We demonstrate that FEP change between substrates and products exactly reflects electrons dissipated in a metabolic transformation. Based on the law of conservation of electron in chemical reactions, a function of FEP change for central metabolism in proliferating cells are further derived, and it can accurately predict metabolic behaviors under hypoxia by maximizing the cellular FEP change to consume electrons. Therefore, enabling electron transfer dictates metabolic reprogramming in hypoxic cells, which underlies the major findings in cancer metabolism and is supported by our experiments. Importantly, our model established on FEP helps to reveal a combination of promising targets to inhibit tumor growth under hypoxia by blocking electron consumption, and could also guide future studies on cancer metabolism under hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "Female parenting is obligate in mammals, but fathering behavior among mammals is rare. Only 3-5% of mammalian species exhibit biparental care, including humans, and mechanisms of fathering behavior remain sparsely studied. However, in species where it does exist, paternal care is often crucial to the survivorship of offspring. The present study is the first to identify new gene targets linked to the experience of fathering behavior in a biparental species using RNA sequencing. In order to determine the pattern of gene expression within the medial preoptic area that is specifically associated with fathering behavior, we identified differentially expressed genes in male prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) that experienced one of three social conditions: virgin males, pair bonded males, and males with fathering experience. Differentially expressed genes from each comparison (i.e., Virgin vs Paired, Virgin vs Fathers, and Paired vs Fathers) were evaluated using the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, and Kegg pathways analysis to reveal metabolic pathways associated with specific differentially expressed genes. Using these tools, we identified a group of genes that are differentially expressed in voles with different amounts of social experience. These genes are involved in a variety of processes, with particular enrichment in genes associated with immune function, metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and the remodeling of dendritic spines. The identification of these genes and processes will lead to novel insights into the biological basis of fathering behavior.",

In this work, we explore the idea of gene embedding, distributed representation of genes, in the spirit of word embedding. From a pure data-driven fashion, we trained a 300 dimension vector representation of all human genes, using gene co-expression patterns in 984 data sets from the GEO databases. These vectors capture functional relatedness of genes in terms of recovering known pathways - the average inner product (similarity) of genes within a pathway is 1.68X greater than that of random genes. Using t-SNE, we produced a gene co-expression map that shows local concentrations of tissue specific genes. We also illustrated the usefulness of the embedded gene vectors, laden with rich information on gene co-expression patterns, in tasks such as gene-gene interaction prediction. Overall, we believe that this distributed representation of genes may be useful for more bioinformatics applications.",

Here we show that in vitro ZIKV infection of human cells, including NPCs, causes disruption of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. NMD is a cellular mRNA surveillance mechanism that is required for normal brain size in mice2-4. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we identified multiple cellular NMD factors that bind to the viral capsid protein, including the central NMD regulator up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1)5. Endogenous UPF1 interacted with the viral capsid protein in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and capsid expression post-transcriptionally downregulated UPF1, a process that we confirmed occurs during de novo ZIKV infection. A further decrease in UPF1 levels by RNAi significantly enhanced ZIKV infection in NPC cultures. We therefore propose that ZIKV, via the capsid protein, has evolved a strategy to dampen antiviral activities of NMD6,7, which subsequently contributes to neuropathology in vivo.",

Using automated homecage training and a novel forelimb sensor, we trained freely-moving mice to initiate forelimb sequences with clearly resolved submillimeter-scale micromovements followed by millimeter-scale reaches to learned spatial targets. Hundreds of thousands of trajectories were decomposed into millions of kinematic primitives, while closed-loop photoinhibition was used to test roles of motor cortical areas. Inactivation of contralateral motor cortex reduced primitive peak speed but, surprisingly, did not substantially affect primitive direction, initiation, termination, or complexity, resulting in isomorphic, spatially contracted trajectories that undershot targets. Our findings demonstrate separable loss of a single kinematic parameter, speed, and identify conditions where loss of cortical drive reduces the gain of motor primitives but does not affect their generation, timing or direction. The combination of high precision forelimb sensing with automated training and neural manipulation provides a system for studying how motor sequences are constructed from elemental building blocks.",

To address this issue, we have collected Ig-seq outputs from 53 studies, covering more than half a billion antibody sequences across diverse immune states, organisms and individuals. We have sorted, cleaned, annotated, translated and numbered these sequences and make the data available via our Observed Antibody Space (OAS) resource at antibodymap.org.

Clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that co-infection by rhinovirus and influenza virus may reduce disease severity and that they may also interfere with each others spread within a host population. To determine how co-infection by these two unrelated respiratory viruses affects pathogenesis, we established a mouse model using a minor serogroup rhinovirus (RV1B) and mouse-adapted influenza A virus (PR8). Infection of mice with RV1B two days before PR8 reduced pathogenesis of mild to moderate, but not severe PR8 infections. Disease attenuation was associated with an early inflammatory response in the lungs and enhanced clearance of PR8. However, co-infection by RV1B did not reduce PR8 viral loads early in infection or inhibit replication of PR8 within respiratory epithelia or in vitro. Inflammation in co-infected mice remained focal, in comparison to diffuse inflammation and damage in the lungs of mice infected by PR8. These findings suggest that RV1B stimulates an early immune response that clears PR8 while limiting excessive pulmonary inflammation. The timing of RV1B co-infection was a critical determinant of protection, suggesting that sufficient time is needed to induce this response. Finally, disease attenuation was not unique to RV1B: co-infection by a murine coronavirus two days before PR8 also reduced disease severity. This model will be critical for understanding the mechanisms responsible for attenuation of influenza disease during co-infection by unrelated respiratory viruses.",

Some lineages are able to lose the specific host tropism, being easily transmitted from animals to humans and vice-versa. The present study aims at clarifying the epidemiology of MRSA intramammary infections in a closed dairy herd, which was running a mastitis control program since years. Quarter milk samples were collected from all lactating cows once a week for 9 weeks and bacteriologically tested. At the end of the follow-up period, also a self taken nasal swab of the milker was analysed. Three cows (12.5%) were MRSA positive, a four showed a transient infection and an MRSA was isolated also from the milker. Somatic cell counts of the infected quarters fluctuated from 1,000 to 1,800,000 cells/mL. All isolates were genotyped using DNA microarrays and identified as the epidemic UK-EMRSA-15 grouping in CC22. All strains carried the genes for {beta}-lactam and macrolide resistance. The milker isolate differed from cow isolates mainly for the absence of the untruncated {beta}-haemolysin and the presence of the immune evasion cluster. The milker had been volunteering in a nursing home since months, thus playing the role of MRSA vector into the herd. Our results showed the adaptive capacity of such MRSA to the bovine host. Therefore, we suggest that CC22-MRSA should be regarded as a potential cause of humanosis in dairy cattle herds.",

    "abstract": "Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are microbial communities that are a feature of arid surface soils worldwide. In drylands where precipitation is pulsed and ephemeral, the ability of biocrust microbiota to rapidly initiate metabolic activity is critical to their survival. Community gene expression was compared after a short duration (1 hour) wetting pulse in both intact and soils disturbed by chronic foot trampling.\\n\\nAcross the metatranscriptomes the majority of transcripts were cyanobacterial in origin, suggesting that cyanobacteria accounted for the bulk of the transcriptionally active cells. Chronic trampling substantially altered the functional profile of the metatranscriptomes, specifically resulting in a significant decrease in transcripts for nitrogen fixation. Soil depth (biocrust and below crust) was a relatively small factor in differentiating the metatranscriptomes, suggesting that the metabolically active bacteria were similar between shallow soil horizons. The dry samples were consistently enriched for hydrogenase genes, indicating that molecular hydrogen may serve as an energy source for the desiccated soil communities. The water pulse was associated with a restructuring of the metatranscriptome, particularly for the biocrusts. Biocrusts increased transcripts for photosynthesis and carbon fixation, suggesting a rapid resuscitation upon wetting. In contrast, the trampled surface soils showed a much smaller response to wetting, indicating that trampling altered the metabolic response of the community. Finally, several biogeochemical cycling genes in carbon and nitrogen cycling were assessed for their change in abundance due to wetting in the biocrusts. Different transcripts encoding the same gene product did not show a consensus response, with some more abundant in dry or wet biocrusts, highlighting the challenges in relating transcript abundance to biogeochemical cycling rates.\\n\\nThese observations demonstrate that metatranscriptome sequencing was able to distinguish alterations in the function of arid soil microbial communities at two varying temporal scales, a long-term ecosystems disturbance through foot trampling, and a short term wetting pulse. Thus, community metatranscriptomes have the potential to inform studies on the response and resilience of biocrusts to various environmental perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Viruses are nanoscale infectious agents which may be inactivated by heat treatment. Although heat inactivation is thought to be caused by the release of genetic material from the capsid, the thermally-induced structural changes in viruses are little known. Here we measured the heat-induced changes in the properties of T7 bacteriophage particles exposed to two-stage (65 {degrees}C and 80 {degrees}C) thermal effect by using AFM-based nanomechanical and topographical measurements. We found that exposure to 65 {degrees}C caused the release of genomic DNA due to the loss of the capsid tail which leads to a destabilization of the T7 particles. Further heating to 80 {degrees}C surprisingly led to an increase in mechanical stability due to partial denaturation of the capsomeric proteins kept within the global capsid arrangement.",

We show that the combined single cell signatures enable accurate construction of regulatory relationships between cis-regulatory elements and the target genes at single-cell resolution, providing a new dimension of features that helps direct discovery of regulatory patterns specific to distinct cell identities. Moreover, we generated the first single cell integrated maps of chromatin accessibility and transcriptome in human pre-implantation embryos and demonstrated the robustness of scCAT-seq in the precise dissection of master transcription factors in cells of distinct states during embryo development.

    "abstract": "Open modification searching (OMS) is a powerful search strategy that identifies peptides carrying any type of modification by allowing a modified spectrum to match against its unmodified variant by using a very wide precursor mass window. A drawback of this strategy, however, is that it leads to a large increase in search time. Although performing an open search can be done using existing spectral library search engines by simply setting a wide precursor mass window, none of these tools have been optimized for OMS, leading to excessive runtimes and suboptimal identification results. Here we present the ANN-SoLo tool for fast and accurate open spectral library searching. ANN-SoLo uses approximate nearest neighbor indexing to speed up OMS by selecting only a limited number of the most relevant library spectra to compare to an unknown query spectrum. This approach is combined with a cascade search strategy to maximize the number of identified unmodified and modified spectra while strictly controlling the false discovery rate, as well as a shifted dot product score to sensitively match modified spectra to their unmodified counterparts. ANN-SoLo achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of speed and the number of identifications. On a previously published human cell line data set, ANN-SoLo confidently identifies more spectra than SpectraST or MSFragger and achieves a speedup of an order of magnitude compared to SpectraST.\\n\\nANN-SoLo is implemented in Python and C++.

    "abstract": "The C. elegans Piwi Argonaute protein PRG-1 and associated piRNAs protect the genomes of germ cells by suppressing the expression of transposons and potentially deleterious foreign nucleic acids. Deficiency for prg-1 compromises germ cell immortality, resulting in normal fertility for many generations followed by progressively reduced fertility and ultimately sterility. The sterility phenotype of prg-1 mutants was recently shown to be a form of reproductive arrest, which implies that prg-1 mutants may become sterile in response to a form of heritable stress. The DAF-16 stress resistance and longevity factor can promote germ cell immortality of prg-1 mutants by activating a systemic RNAi pathway. We found that this RNAi pathway was not required for the somatic longevity function of DAF-16. Given that prg-1 mutant germ cells may transmit a form of heritable stress, we studied the somatic longevity of prg-1 mutant adults. We found that early generation prg-1 mutants had normal lifespans, but that late-generation adults that displayed reduced fertility or sterility were long lived. Germ cells of long-lived late-generation prg-1 mutants gave rise to F1 cross progeny that were heterozygous for prg-1, fertile and also long lived. However, in the absence of DAF-16, the heritable stress transmitted by prg-1 mutant germ cells was deleterious and caused lifespan to shorten. We conclude that deficiency for the genomic surveillance factor PRG-1/Piwi results in germ cells that transmit a heritable stress that promotes somatic longevity via DAF-16/Foxo, which could be relevant transgenerational regulationof aging.",

    "abstract": "A key goal of geroscience research is to discover effective interventions to extend human healthspan, the years of healthy life. Currently, majority of the geroprotectors are found by testing compounds in model organisms; whether these compounds will be effective in humans is largely unknown. Here we present a novel strategy called ANDRU (aging network based drug discovery) to help the discovery of human geroprotectors. Instead of relying on model organisms, this approach is driven by human genomic and pharmacogenomic data. It first identifies human aging subnetworks that putatively function at the interface between aging and age-related diseases; it then screens for pharmacological or genetic interventions that may \\\"reverse\\\" the age-associated transcriptional changes seen in these subnetworks. We applied ANDRU to human adipose and artery tissues. In adipose tissue, PTPN1, a target for diabetes treatment and APOE, a known genetic factor for human longevity and diseases like Alzheimers disease, were ranked at the top. For small molecules, conjugated linoleic acid and metformin, a drug commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes, were ranked among the top compounds. In artery tissue, N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists and curcumin were ranked at the top. In summary, ANDRU represents a promising human data-driven strategy that may speed up the discovery of interventions to extend human healthspan.",

    "abstract": "Active sensing by means of light is rare. In vertebrates, it is known only from chemiluminescent fish with light organs below their pupils, an anatomical arrangement that is ideal to generate eyeshine in the pupils of nearby organisms. Here, we test whether diurnal fish can achieve the same by redirecting sunlight through reflection instead. We recently showed that small (< 5 cm), benthic, marine triplefin fish actively redirect downwelling light using their iris. We hypothesized that this mechanism allows triplefins to improve detection of a cryptic organism by generating eyeshine in its pupil. Here, we tested this by attaching small dark hats to triplefins to shade their iris from downwelling light. Two controls consisted of triplefins with a clear or no hat. These treatments test the prediction that light redirection increases the visual detection ability of triplefins. To this end, we placed treated fish in a tank with a display compartment containing either a stone as the control stimulus, or a scorpionfish, i.e. a cryptic, motionless triplefin predator with retroreflective eyes. After overnight acclimatization, we determined the average distance triplefins kept from the display compartment over two days. Both in the laboratory (n = 15 replicates per treatment) and in a similar field experiment at 15 m depth (n = 43 replicates per treatment) fish kept longer distances from the scorpionfish than from the stone. This response varied between hat treatments: shaded triplefins stayed significantly closer to the scorpionfish in the laboratory and in one of two orientations tested in the field. A follow-up field experiment at 10 m depth revealed the immediate response of triplefins to a scorpionfish. At first, many individuals (n = 80) moved towards it, with shaded triplefins getting significantly closer. All individuals then gradually moved to a safer distance at the opposite half of the tank. Visual modelling supported the experimental results by showing that triplefins can redirect enough light with their iris to increase a scorpionfishs pupil brightness above detection threshold at a distance of 7 cm under average field conditions and at more than 12 cm under favorable conditions. We conclude that triplefins are generally good in the visual detection of a cryptic predator, but can significantly improve this ability when able to redirect downwelling light with their iris and induce eyeshine in the predators pupil. We discuss the consequences of \\\"diurnal active photolocation\\\" for visual detection and camouflage among fish species.",
