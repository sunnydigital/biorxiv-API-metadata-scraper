    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is a powerful tool to explore cellular heterogeneity. However, most of these methods focus on the 3-end of polyadenylated transcripts and provide only a partial view of the transcriptome. We introduce C1 CAGE, a method for the detection of transcript 5-ends with an original sample multiplexing strategy in the C1 microfluidic system. We first quantified the performance of C1 CAGE and found it as accurate and sensitive as other methods in C1 system. We then used it to profile promoter and enhancer activities in the cellular response to TGF-{beta} of lung cancer cells and discovered subpopulations of cells differing in their response. We also describe enhancer RNA dynamics revealing transcriptional bursts in subsets of cells with transcripts arising from either strand within a single-cell in a mutually exclusive manner, which was validated using single molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe genome-wide expression profile of genes in different tissues/cell types and developmental stages is a vital component of many functional genomic studies. Transcriptome data obtained by RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) is often deposited in public databases that are made available via data portals. Data visualization is one of the first steps in assessment and hypothesis generation. However, these databases do not typically include visualization tools and establishing one is not trivial for users who are not computational experts. This, as well as the various formats in which data is commonly deposited, makes the processes of data access, sharing and utility more difficult. Our goal was to provide a simple and user-friendly repository that meets these needs for datasets from major agricultural crops.\\n\\nDescriptionAgriSeqDB (https://expression.latrobe.edu.au/agriseqdb), is a database for viewing, analysing and interpreting developmental and tissue/cell-specific transcriptome data from several species, including major agricultural crops such as wheat, rice, maize, barley and tomato. The disparate manner in which public transcriptome data is often warehoused and the challenge of visualizing raw data are both major hurdles to data reuse. The popular eFP browser does an excellent job of presenting transcriptome data in an easily interpretable view, but previous implementation has been mostly on a case-by-case basis. Here we present an integrated visualisation database of transcriptome datasets from six species that did not previously have public-facing visualisations. We combine the eFP browser, for gene-by-gene investigation, with the Degust browser, which enables visualisation of all transcripts across multiple samples. The two visualisation interfaces launch from the same point, enabling users to easily switch between analysis modes. The tools allow users, even those without bioinformatics expertise, to mine into datasets and understand the behaviour of transcripts of interest across samples and time. We have also incorporated an additional graphic download option to simplify incorporation into presentations or publications.\\n\\nConclusionPowered by eFP and Degust browsers, AgriSeqDB is a quick and easy-to-use platform for data analysis and visualization in five crops and Arabidopsis. Furthermore, it provides a tool that makes it easy for researchers to share their datasets, promoting research collaborations and dataset reuse.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents a major global health problem for which a vaccine is not available. MVA-HCV is a unique HCV vaccine candidate based in the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vector expressing the nearly full-length genome of HCV genotype 1a that elicits broad and polyfunctional CD8+ T-cell responses in mice. With the aim to improve the immune response of MVA-HCV and due to the importance of interferon (IFN) in HCV infection, we deleted in MVA-HCV the vaccinia virus (VACV) C6L gene, encoding an inhibitor of IFN-{beta} that prevents activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. The resulting vaccine candidate (MVA-HCV {Delta}C6L) expresses all HCV antigens and deletion of C6L had no effect on viral growth in permissive chicken cells. In human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, infection with MVA-HCV {Delta}C6L triggered severe down-regulation of IFN-{beta}, IFN-{beta}-induced genes and cytokines similarly to MVA-HCV, as defined by real-time PCR and microarray analysis. In infected mice both vectors had a similar profile of recruited immune cells and induced comparable levels of adaptive and memory HCV-specific CD8+ T-cells, mainly against p7+NS2 and NS3 HCV proteins, with a T cell effector memory (TEM) phenotype. Furthermore, antibodies against E2 were also induced. Overall, our findings showed that while these vectors had a profound inhibitory effect on gene expression of the host, they strongly elicited CD8+ T cell and humoral responses against HCV antigens. These observations add support to the consideration of these vectors as potential vaccine candidates against HCV.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEHepatitis C virus represents a global health problem with 71 million of people infected worldwide. While direct-acting antivirals agents can cure hepatitis C virus infection in most of patients, their high cost and the emergence of drug resistant variants make them not a feasible and affordable strategy to eradicate the virus. Therefore, a vaccine is an urgent goal that requires efforts in understanding the correlates of protection for hepatitis C virus clearance. Poxvirus vectors, in particular the attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara, are ideal as vaccine candidates due to their ability to induce both T and B cell immune responses against heterologous antigens and protection against a wide spectrum of pathogens. Here we describe the generation, genetics and immunogenicity elicited by MVA-HCV {Delta}C6L, a novel vaccine candidate for hepatitis C virus that expresses nearly all of hepatitis C proteins but lacks an IFN-{beta} inhibitor, the C6 vaccinia virus protein.",

    "abstract": "Condensins are genome organisers that shape chromosomes and promote their accurate transmission. Several studies have also implicated condensins in gene expression, although the mechanisms have remained enigmatic. Here, we report on the role of condensin in gene expression in fission and budding yeasts. In contrast to previous studies, we provide compelling evidence that condensin plays no direct role in the maintenance of the transcriptome, neither during interphase nor during mitosis. We further show that the changes in gene expression in post-mitotic fission yeast cells that result from condensin inactivation are largely a consequence of chromosome missegregation during anaphase, which notably depletes the RNA-exosome from daughter cells. Crucially, preventing karyotype abnormalities in daughter cells restores a normal transcriptome despite condensin inactivation. Thus, chromosome instability, rather than a direct role of condensin in the transcription process, changes gene expression. This knowledge challenges the concept of gene regulation by canonical condensin complexes.",

Although the biochemical mechanisms involved in sperm-sperm adhesion are unclear, aggregation can enhance the motility of the cells. Here, we report a thorough computational investigation on the role of cellular geometry in the performance of sperm aggregates. The sperm head is modeled as a persistent random walker characterized by a non-trivial three-dimensional shape and equipped with an adhesive region where cell-cell binding occurs. By considering both a simple parametric head shape and a computer reconstruction of a real head shape based on morphometric data, we demonstrate that the geometry of the head and the structure of the adhesive region crucially affect both the stability and motility of the aggregates. Our analysis further suggests that the apical hook, commonly found in the sperm of most muroid rodents, might serve to shield portions of the adhesive region and promote efficient alignment of the velocities of the interacting cells.",

Here, we provide a metagenomic description of a chemoautotrophic gammaproteobacterial symbiont associated with Thyasira cf. gouldi, a sediment-dwelling bivalve from the family Thyasiridae. Symbionts of thyasirids differ from those of other bivalves by being located outside rather than inside gill epithelial cells, and recent work suggests that they are capable of living freely in the environment. The T. cf. gouldi symbiont genome shows no signs of genomic reduction and contains many genes that would only be useful outside the host, including flagellar and chemotaxis genes. The thyasirid symbiont may be capable of sulfur oxidation via both the sulfur oxidation and dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathways, as observed in other bivalve symbionts. In addition, genes for hydrogen oxidation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction were found, suggesting varied metabolic capabilities under a range of redox conditions. The genes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle are also present, along with membrane bound sugar importer channels, suggesting that the bacteria may be mixotrophic. In this study, we have generated the first thyasirid symbiont genomic resources and lay the groundwork for further research in tracking the changes required for life as a bivalve symbiont.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALEMicrobial growth rate is an important physiological parameter that is challenging to measure in situ, partly because microbes grow slowly in many environments. Recently, it has been demonstrated that generation times of S. aureus in cystic fibrosis (CF) infections can be determined by D2O-labeling of actively synthesized fatty acids. To improve species specificity and allow growth rate monitoring for a greater range of pathogens during the treatment of infections, it is desirable to accurately quantify trace incorporation of deuterium into phospholipids.\\n\\nMETHODSLipid extracts of D2O-treated E. coli cultures were measured on LC-ESI-MS instruments equipped with TOF and Orbitrap mass analyzers, and used for comparison with the analysis of fatty acids by isotope-ratio GC-MS. We then develop an approach to enable tracking of lipid labeling, by following the transition from stationary into exponential growth in pure cultures. Lastly, we apply D2O-labeling lipidomics to clinical samples from CF patients with chronic lung infections.\\n\\nRESULTSLipidomics facilitates deuterium quantification in lipids at levels that are useful for many labeling applications (>0.03 at% D). In the E. coli cultures, labeling dynamics of phospholipids depend largely on their acyl chains and between phospholipids we notice differences that are not obvious from absolute concentrations alone. For example, cyclopropyl-containing lipids reflect the regulation of cyclopropane fatty acid synthase, which is predominantly expressed at the beginning of stationary phase. The deuterium incorporation into a lipid that is specific for S. aureus in CF sputum, indicates an average generation time of the pathogen on the order of one cell doubling per day.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThis study demonstrates how trace level measurement of stable isotopes in intact lipids can be used to quantify lipid metabolism in pure cultures and provides guidelines that enable growth rate measurements in microbiome samples after incubation with a low percentage of D2O.",

    "abstract": "The neighbors principle implicit in any machine learning algorithm says that samples with similar labels should be close to one another in feature space as well. For example, while tumors are heterogeneous, tumors that have similar genomics profiles can also be expected to have similar responses to a specific therapy. Simple correlation coefficients provide an effective way to determine whether this principle holds when features and labels are both scalar, but not when either is multivariate. A new class of generalized correlation coefficients based on inter-point distances addresses this need and is called \\\"distance correlation\\\". There is only one rank-based distance correlation test available to date, and it is asymmetric in the samples, requiring that one sample be distinguished as a fixed point of reference. Therefore, we introduce a novel, nonparametric statistic, REVA, inspired by the Kendall rank correlation coefficient. We use U-statistic theory to derive the asymptotic distribution of the new correlation coefficient, developing additional large and finite sample properties along the way. To establish the admissibility of the REVA statistic, and explore the utility and limitations of our model, we compared it to the most widely used distance based correlation coefficient in a range of simulated conditions, demonstrating that REVA does not depend on an assumption of linearity, and is robust to high levels of noise, high dimensions, and the presence of outliers. We also present an application to real data, applying REVA to determine whether cancer cells with similar genetic profiles also respond similarly to a targeted therapeutic.\\n\\nAuthor summarySometimes a simple question arises: how does the distance between two samples in multivariate space compare to another scalar value associated with each sample. Here, we propose theory for a nonparametric test to statistically test this association. This test is independent of the scale of the scalar data, and thus generalizable to any comparison of samples with both high-dimensional data and a scalar. We apply the resulting statistic, REVA, to problems in cancer biology motivated by the model that cancer cells with more similar gene expression profiles to one another can be expected to have a more similar response to therapy.",

    "abstract": "We developed a novel approach for quantifying the equilibrium-exchange kinetics of carrier-mediated transmembrane transport of fluorinated substrates. Our method is based on an adapted kinetic theory describing the concentration dependence of the transmembrane-exchange rates of two simultaneously transported species. Using the new approach, we quantified the kinetics of membrane transport of both anomers of three monofluorinated glucose analogues in human erythrocytes (red blood cells: RBCs) using 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) exchange spectroscopy (EXSY). An inosine-based glucose-free medium was shown to promote survival and stable metabolism of RBCs over the duration of the experiments (a few hours). Earlier NMR studies only yielded the apparent rate constants and transmembrane fluxes of the anomeric species, whereas we were able to categorize the two anomers in terms of the catalytic activity (specificity constants) of the glucose transport protein GLUT1 towards them. Differences in the membrane permeability of the three glucose analogues were qualitatively interpreted in terms of local perturbations in the bonding of substrates to amino-acid residues in the active site of GLUT1. The methodology of this work will be applicable to studies of other carrier-mediated membrane transport processes, especially those with competition between simultaneously transported species. The GLUT1-specific results will apply to the design of probes of glucose transport, or inhibitors of glucose metabolism in cells including those exhibiting the Warburg effect.\\n\\nABBREVIATIONS",

We sought to identify potential susceptibility genes by integrating the risk variants at these regions with genetic variants impacting gene expression and splicing of nearby genes. We compiled gene expression and genotyping data from 2,169 samples for 6 different HGSOC-relevant tissue types. We integrated these data with GWAS data from 13,037 HGSOC cases and 40,941 controls, and performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) across >70,000 significantly heritable gene/exon features. We identified 24 transcriptome-wide significant associations for 14 unique genes, plus 90 significant exon-level associations in 20 unique genes. We implicated multiple novel genes at risk loci, e.g. LRRC46 at 19q21.32 (TWAS P=1x10-9) and a PRC1 splicing event (TWAS P=9x10-8) which was splice-variant specific and exhibited no eQTL signal. Functional analyses in HGSOC cell lines found evidence of essentiality for GOSR2, INTS1, KANSL1 and PRC1; with the latter gene showing levels of essentiality comparable to that of MYC. Overall, gene expression and splicing events explained 41% of SNP-heritability for HGSOC (s.e. 11%, P=2.5x10-4), implicated at least one target gene for 6/13 distinct genome-wide significant regions and revealed 2 known and 26 novel candidate susceptibility genes for HGSOC.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEFor many ovarian cancer risk regions, the target genes regulated by germline genetic variants are unknown. Using expression data from >2,100 individuals, this study identified novel associations of genes and splicing variants with ovarian cancer risk; with transcriptional variation now explaining over one-third of the SNP-heritability for this disease.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities have been shown to play an important role for host health in mammals, especially humans. It is thought that microbes could play an equally important role in other animal hosts such as insects. A growing body of evidence seems to support this, however most of the research effort in understanding host-microbe interactions in insects has been focused on a few well-studied groups such as bees, cockroaches and termites. We studied the effects of the gut-associated microbial community on the growth and survival of the eastern spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana, an economically important lepidopteran forest pest in eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. Contrary to our expectations, the gut microbial community of spruce budworm larvae does not appear to influence host growth or survival. Our results agree with the hypothesis that lepidopteran larvae lack resident microbial communities and are not nutritionally dependent on bacterial symbionts.",

    "abstract": "Rhizopus delemar is an invasive fungal pathogen, responsible for the frequently fatal disease mucormycosis. Germination, a crucial mechanism by which spores of Rhizopus delemar infect and cause disease, is a key developmental process that transforms the dormant spore state into a vegetative one. Understanding the molecular mechanisms which underpin this transformation may be key to controlling mucormycosis, however the regulation of germination remains poorly understood. This study describes the phenotypic and transcriptional changes which take place over the course of germination. This process is characterised by four distinct stages: dormancy, isotropic swelling, germ tube emergence and hyphal growth. Dormant spores are shown to be transcriptionally unique, expressing a subset of transcripts absent in later developmental stages. A large shift in the expression profile is prompted by the initiation of germination, with genes involved in respiration, chitin, cytoskeleton and actin regulation appearing to be important for this transition. A period of transcriptional consistency can be seen throughout isotropic swelling, before the transcriptional landscape shifts again at the onset of hyphal growth. This study provides a greater understanding of the regulation of germination and highlights processes involved in transforming Rhizopus delemar from a single to a multicellular organism.\\n\\nImportanceGermination is key to the growth of many organisms, including fungal spores. Mucormycete spores exist abundantly within the environment and germinate to form hyphae. These spores are capable of infecting immunocompromised individuals, causing the disease mucormycosis Germination from spore to hyphae within patients leads to angioinvasion, tissue necrosis and often fatal infections. This study advances our understanding of how spore germination occurs in the mucormycetes, identifying processes we may be able to inhibit to help prevent or treat mucormycosis.",

    "abstract": "Established models of perceptual metacognition, the ability to evaluate our perceptual judgments, posit that perceptual confidence depends on the strength or quality of feedforward sensory evidence. However, alternative theoretical accounts suggest the entire perception-action cycle, and not only variation in sensory evidence, is monitored when evaluating confidence in ones percepts. Such models lead to the counterintuitive prediction that perceptual confidence should be directly modulated by features of motor output. To evaluate this proposal here we recorded electromyographic (EMG) activity of motor effectors while subjects performed a near-threshold perceptual discrimination task and reported their confidence in each response. A subset of trials exhibited sub-threshold EMG activity in response effectors before a decision was made. Strikingly, trial-by-trial analysis showed that confidence, but not accuracy, was significantly higher on trials with subthreshold motor activation. These findings support a hypothesis that preparatory motor activity impacts upon confidence over and above performance, consistent with models in which perceptual metacognition integrates information across the perception-action cycle.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient storage and metabolism effects on reproductive behavior are well studied in higher vertebrates like mammals, but are less understood in simpler systems. Drosophila melanogaster is well suited to study the ramifications of diet and metabolic energy storage on reproductive behaviors as they are commonly used to explore energy mobilization pathways. We tested, for the first time, courtship of the naturally occurring adipose (adp60) mutant which over-accumulates triglycerides and glycogen on a normal diet. We also fed wild type (WT) flies either a normal diet, high fat diet or food deprived them before measuring courtship, copulations, and glycogen and triglyceride levels. Adipose mutants decreased both courtship and copulation frequency, yet showed the highest glycogen and triglyceride levels. We suggest the adp60 physique and/or an altered ability to utilize mobilize energy explains these effects. Food deprived WT flies had the lowest glycogen and triglycerides but exhibited shortened courtship latencies with increased courtship behaviors. This may be due to a decreased lifespan of food deprived flies leading to a greater reproductive drive. However, high fat fed flies copulated more frequently and had the highest triglycerides among WT groups, yet equal glycogen levels to the normal fed WT group. Thus, a high fat diet either increases male attractivity or male courtship persistence. Taken together, available diet and nutrient storage affects male fly reproductive behavior in a unique manner, which may be explained by their natural history, and provides a paradigm for understanding energetics based on reproductive potential.",

    "abstract": "The past decade has seen a revolution in genomic technologies that enabled a flood of genome-wide profiling of chromatin marks. Recent literature tried to understand gene regulation by predicting gene expression from large-scale chromatin measurements. Two fundamental challenges exist for such learning tasks: (1) genome-wide chromatin signals are spatially structured, high-dimensional and highly modular; and (2) the core aim is to understand what the relevant factors are and how they work together. Previous studies either failed to model complex dependencies among input signals or relied on separate feature analysis to explain the decisions. This paper presents an attention-based deep learning approach, AttentiveChrome, that uses a unified architecture to model and to interpret dependencies among chromatin factors for controlling gene regulation. AttentiveChrome uses a hierarchy of multiple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) modules to encode the input signals and to model how various chromatin marks cooperate automatically. AttentiveChrome trains two levels of attention jointly with the target prediction, enabling it to attend differentially to relevant marks and to locate important positions per mark. We evaluate the model across 56 different cell types (tasks) in humans. Not only is the proposed architecture more accurate, but its attention scores provide a better interpretation than state-of-the-art feature visualization methods such as saliency maps.1",

    "abstract": "A clinical trial was performed to evaluate 3BNC117, a potent anti_HIV_1 antibody, in infected individuals during suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) and subsequent analytical treatment interruption (ATI). The circulating reservoir was evaluated by quantitative and qualitative outgrowth assay (Q2VOA) at entry and after 6 months, prior to ATI. Although there were no significant quantitative changes in the size of the reservoir, the composition of circulating reservoir clones varied over the 6_month period before treatment interruption in a manner that did not correlate with antibody sensitivity. The neutralization profile obtained from the reservoir by Q2VOA was predictive of time to rebound after ATI, and thus of antibody efficacy. Although 3BNC117 binding site amino acid variants found in rebound viruses pre_existed in the latent reservoir, only 3 of 217 rebound viruses were identical to 868 latent viruses. Instead many of the rebound viruses appeared to be recombinants, even in individuals with resistant reservoir viruses. By incorporating the possibility of recombination, 63% of the rebound viruses could have derived from the observed latent reservoir. In conclusion, viruses emerging during ATI in individuals treated with 3BNC117 are not the dominant species found in the circulating reservoir, but instead appear to represent recombinants.\\n\\nSummaryIn the setting of a clinical trial evaluating the anti_HIV_1 antibody 3BNC117, Cohen et al. demonstrate that rebound viruses that emerge following interruption of antiretroviral therapy are distinct from circulating latent viruses. However, rebound viruses often appear to be recombinants between isolated latent viruses.",

Fluoxetine can reinstate early-life critical period-like neuronal plasticity and has been used to recover functional vision in adult rats with amblyopia. This phase 2, randomized, double-blind (fluoxetine vs. placebo), multicenter clinical trial examined whether or not fluoxetine can improve visual acuity in amblyopic adults. This interventional trial included 42 participants diagnosed with moderate to severe amblyopia. Subjects were randomized to receive either 20 mg fluoxetine (n=22) or placebo (n=20). During the 10-week treatment period, all subjects performed daily computerized perceptual training and eye patching. There was no significant difference in treatment efficacy between the groups. Visual acuity at the primary endpoint had significantly improved over baseline in both the fluoxetine (-0.167 logMAR) and placebo (-0.194 logMAR) groups (both p < 0.001). Because patching alone is not effective in adults, the visual acuity improvement likely resulted from perceptual training. There was a positive correlation between visual acuity improvement and the perceptual training time. While this study failed to provide evidence that fluoxetine enhances neuroplasticity, our data support the usefulness of perceptual training for vision improvement in adults with amblyopia.",

Here, we propose a sustainability index based on the premise that sustainable systems do not lose or gain Fisher Information over time. We test this approach using time series data from the AmeriFlux network that measures ecosystem respiration, water and energy fluxes in order to elucidate two key sustainability features: ecosystem health and stability. A novel definition of ecosystem health is developed based on the concept of criticality, which implies that if a systems fluctuations are scale invariant then the system is in a balance between robustness and adaptability. We define ecosystem stability by taking an information theory approach that measures its entropy and Fisher information. Analysis of the Ameriflux consortium big data set of ecosystem respiration time series is contrasted with land condition data. In general we find a good agreement between the sustainability index and land condition data. However, we acknowledge that the results are a preliminary test of the approach and further verification will require a multi-signal analysis. For example, high values of the sustainability index for some croplands are counter-intuitive and we interpret these results as ecosystems maintained in artificial health due to continuous human-induced inflows of matter and energy in the form of soil nutrients and control of competition, pests and disease.",

We evaluated the performance of CCI and an alternative summary method, logistic principal component analysis (LPCA), to adjust for comorbidities, using as an example the association between insurance and mortality.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsUsing all admissions in the National Trauma Data Bank 2010-2015, we extracted mortality, payment method, and 36 ICD-9-derived comorbidities. We estimated ORs for the association between uninsured status and mortality before and after adjusting for CCI, LPCA, and separate covariates. We also calculated standardized mean differences (SMDs) of comorbidity variables before and after weighting the sample using inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) for CCI, LPCA, and separate covariates.\\n\\nResultsIn 4,936,880 admissions, most (68.3%) had at least one comorbidity. Considerable imbalance was observed in the unweighted sample (mean SMD=0.086, OR=1.17), which was almost entirely eliminated by IPTW on separate covariates (mean SMD=0.012, OR=1.36). The CCI performed similarly to the unweighted sample (mean SMD=0.080, OR=1.25), while 2 LPCA axes were better able to control for confounding (mean SMD=0.04, OR=1.31). Using covariate adjustment, the CCI accounted for 56.1% of observed confounding, whereas 2 LPCA axes accounted for 91.3%.\\n\\nConclusionsThe use of the CCI to adjust for confounding may result in residual confounding, and alternative strategies should be considered. LPCA may be a viable alternative to adjusting for each comorbidity when samples are small or positivity assumptions are violated.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis is one of the neglected infectious diseases in sub Saharan Africa and most of the available data is based on blood donors. Health care workers (HCWs) often get infected as a result of their close contact with patients. A cross sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B and C among this group of professionals with a view to improving the quality of care to their patients. Hepatitis B and C infections pose a major public health problem worldwide. While infection is highest in the developing world particularly Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, healthcare workers are at higher risk of acquiring blood-borne viral infections, particularly Hepatitis B and C which are mostly asymptomatic. This study was aimed at determining the prevalence of Hepatitis B and C infections and associated risk factors among health care workers in Dutse Metropolis, Jigawa State - Nigeria. A standard rapid immuno-chromatographic technique i.e. rapid ELISA was used to screen all sera for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis C viral antibody (HCVAb) respectively. Strips containing coated antibodies and antigens to HBV and HCV respectively were removed from the foil. Strips were labeled according to samples. Using a separate disposable pipette, 2 drops of the sample (plasma) were added into each test strip and allowed to run across the absorbent pad. Results were read after 15 minutes. The prevalence of HBV and HCV infection in 100 healthcare workers was determined by testing the plasma collected from the clients during their normal checkup using HBsAg and HCVAb test strips. Results were subjected to statistical analysis using chi-square test. The prevalence of HBV among HCWs was 19 out of 100 (19.0%) and that of HCV was 5 out of 100 (5.0%) where in both cases, higher prevalence was observed among female nurses. It was also observed that all HCV positive cases were recorded among nurses only. The study revealed that nurses are at greater risk of contracting HBV and HCV due to their frequent contact with patients. It is therefore recommended that effective vaccination and other infection control measures be encouraged among healthcare workers.",

    "abstract": "Maternal adversity is associated with long-term physiological changes in offspring. These are believed to be mediated through epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation (DNAm). Changes in DNAm are often interpreted as damage or as part of plastic responses of the embryo. We propose that selection on stochastic DNAm differences generated during epigenetic reprogramming after fertilization contributes to the effects of maternal adversity on DNAm. Using a mathematical model of epigenetic reprogramming in the early embryo we predict that this \\\"epigenetic selection\\\" will generate a characteristic reduction in variance of DNAm at selected loci in populations exposed to maternal adversity. We tested this prediction using DNAm data from a human cohort prenatally exposed to the Dutch Famine and confirmed the reduction in DNAm variance, suggesting that epigenetic selection may have occurred. Epigenetic selection should be considered as a possible mechanism linking adversity in pregnancy to offspring health and may have implications for the likely effectiveness of intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPopulation-based, prospective studies can provide important insights into Parkinsons disease (PD) and other parkinsonian disorders. Participant follow-up in such studies is often achieved through linkage to routinely-collected healthcare datasets. We systematically reviewed the published literature on the accuracy of these datasets for this purpose.\\n\\nMethodsWe searched four electronic databases for published studies that compared PD and parkinsonism cases identified using routinely-collected data to a reference standard. We extracted study characteristics and two accuracy measures: positive predictive value (PPV) and/or sensitivity.\\n\\nResultsWe identified 18 articles, resulting in 27 measures of PPV and 14 of sensitivity. For PD, PPVs ranged from 56-90% in hospital datasets, 53-87% in prescription datasets, 81-90% in primary care datasets and was 67% in mortality datasets. Combining diagnostic and medication codes increased PPV. For parkinsonism, PPVs ranged from 36-88% in hospital datasets, 40-74% in prescription datasets, and was 94% in mortality datasets. Sensitivities ranged from 15-73% in single datasets for PD and 43-63% in single datasets for parkinsonism.\\n\\nConclusionsIn many settings, routinely-collected datasets generate good PPVs and reasonable sensitivities for identifying PD and parkinsonism cases. Further research is warranted to investigate primary care and medication datasets, and to develop algorithms that balance a high PPV with acceptable sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "A number of vaccines against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection are approaching licensure. Deciding which RSV vaccine strategy, if any, to introduce, will partly depend on cost-effectiveness analyses, which compares the relative costs and health benefits of a potential vaccination programme. Health benefits are usually measured in Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) loss, however, there are no QALY loss estimates for RSV that have been determined using standardised instruments. Moreover, in children under the age of five years in whom severe RSV episodes predominantly occur, there are no appropriate standardised instruments to estimate QALY loss. We estimated the QALY loss due to RSV across all ages by developing a novel regression model which predicts the QALY loss without the use of standardised instruments. To do this, we conducted a surveillance study which targeted confirmed episodes in children under the age of five years (confirmed cases) and their household members who experienced symptoms of RSV during the same time (suspected cases.) All participants were asked to complete questions regarding their health during the infection, with the suspected cases aged 5-14 and 15+ years old additionally providing Health-Related Quality of Life (HR-QoL) loss estimates through completing EQ-5D-3L-Y and EQ-5D-3L instruments respectively. The questionnaire responses from the suspected cases were used to calibrate the regression model. The calibrated regression model then used other questionnaire responses to predict the HR-QoL loss without the use of EQ-5D instruments. The age-specific QALY loss was then calculated by multiplying the HR-QoL loss on the worst day predicted from the regression model, with estimates for the duration of infection from the questionnaires and a scaling factoring for disease severity. Our regression model for predicting HR-QoL loss estimates that for the worst day of infection, suspected RSV cases in persons five years and older who do and do not seek healthcare have an HR-QoL loss of 0{middle dot}616 (95% CI 0{middle dot}155-1{middle dot}371) and 0{middle dot}405 (95% CI 0{middle dot}111-1{middle dot}137) respectively. This leads to a QALY loss per RSV episode of 1{middle dot}950 x 10-3 (95% CI 0{middle dot}185 x 10-3 -9{middle dot}578 x 10-3) and 1{middle dot}543 x 10-3 (95% CI 0{middle dot}136 x 10-3 -6{middle dot}406 x 10-3) respectively. For confirmed cases in a child under the age of five years who sought healthcare, our model predicted a HR-QoL loss on the worst day of infection of 0{middle dot}820 (95% CI 0{middle dot}222-1{middle dot}450) resulting in a QALY loss per RSV episode of 3{middle dot}823 x 10-3 (95% CI 0{middle dot}492 x 10-3 -12{middle dot}766 x 10-3). Combing these results with previous estimates of RSV burden in the UK, we estimate the annual QALY loss of healthcare seeking RSV episodes as 1,199 for individuals aged five years and over and 1,441 for individuals under five years old. The QALY loss due to an RSV episode is less than the QALY loss due to an Influenza episode. These results have important implications for potential RSV vaccination programmes, which has so far focused on preventing infections in infants--where the highest reported disease burden lies. Future potential RSV vaccination programmes should also evaluate their impact on older children and adults, where there is a substantial but unsurveilled QALY loss.",

The results both show that the spousal similarity in TL is lower in the US and also varies by the length of time spouses have been married as well as the educational attainments of husbands.

    "abstract": "Predicting regulatory function of non-coding DNA using genomic information remains a major goal in genomics, and an important step in interpreting the cis-regulatory code. Regulatory capacity can be partially inferred from transcription factor occupancy, histone modifications, motif enrichment, and evolutionary conservation. However, combinations of these features in well-studied systems such as Drosophila have limited predictive accuracy. Here we examine the current limits of computational enhancer prediction by applying machine-learning methods to an extensive set of genomic features, validating predictions with the Fly Enhancer Resource, which characterized the transcriptional activity of approximately fifteen percent of the genome. Supervised machine learning trained on a range of genomic features identify active elements with a high degree of accuracy, but are less successful at distinguishing tissue-specific expression patterns. Consistent with previous observations of their widespread genomic interactions, many transcription factors were associated with enhancers not known to be direct functional targets. Interestingly, no single factor was necessary for enhancer identification, although binding by the 'pioneer' transcription factor Zelda was the most predictive feature for enhancer activity. Using an increasing number of predictive features improved classification with diminishing returns. Thus, additional single-timepoint ChIP data may have only marginal utility for discerning true regulatory regions. On the other hand, spatially- and temporally-differentiated genomic features may provide more power for this type of computational enhancer identification. Inclusion of new types of information distinct from current chromatin-immunoprecipitation data may enable more precise identification of enhancers, and further insight into the features that distinguish their biological functions.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important human pathogen belonging to the Hepadnaviridae family, Orthohepadnavirus genus. It infects over 240 million people globally. The reverse transcription during its genome replication leads to low fidelity DNA synthesis, which is the source of variability in the viral proteins. To investigate the variability quantitatively, we retrieved amino acid sequences of 5167 records of all available HBV genotypes (A-J) from the Genbank database. The amino acid sequences encoded by the open reading frames (ORF) S/C/P/X in the HBV genome were extracted and subjected to alignment respectively. We analyzed the variability of the lengths and the sequences of proteins as well as the frequencies of amino acids. Our study comprehensively characterized of the variability and conservation of HBV at the level of amino acids, especially for the structural proteins, hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg), to find out the potential sites critical for virus assembly and immune recognition. Interestingly, the preS1/S2 domains in HBsAg were variable at some positions of amino acid residues, which provides a potential mechanism of immune-escape for HBV, while the preS2 and S domains were conserved in the lengths of protein sequences. In the S domain, the cysteine residues and the secondary structures of the alpha-helix and beta-sheet were likely critical for the stable folding of the protein structure. The preC domain and C-terminal domain (CTD) of the core protein are highly conserved. And the polymerases HBpol and the HBx were highly variable at the amino acid level.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic connectivity, measured using resting-state fMRI, has emerged as a fundamental tool in the study of the human brain. However, due to practical limitations, many studies do not collect enough resting-state data to generate reliable measures of intrinsic connectivity necessary for studying individual differences. Here we present general functional connectivity (GFC) as a method for leveraging shared features across resting-state and task fMRI and demonstrate in the Human Connectome Project and the Dunedin Study that GFC offers better test-retest reliability than intrinsic connectivity estimated from the same amount of resting-state data alone. Furthermore, at equivalent scan lengths, GFC displays higher heritability on average than resting-state functional connectivity. We also show that predictions of cognitive ability from GFC generalize across datasets, performing as well or better than resting-state or task data alone. Collectively, our work suggests that GFC can improve the reliability of intrinsic connectivity estimates in existing datasets and, subsequently, the opportunity to identify meaningful correlates of individual differences in behavior. Given that task and resting-state data are often collected together, many researchers can immediately derive more reliable measures of intrinsic connectivity through the adoption of GFC rather than solely using resting-state data. Moreover, by better capturing heritable variation in intrinsic connectivity, GFC represents a novel endophenotype with broad applications in clinical neuroscience and biomarker discovery.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A viruses evolve rapidly to escape host immunity, such that individuals can be infected multiple times with the same subtype. The form and duration of protective immunity after each influenza infection are poorly understood. Here, we quantify the dynamics of protective immunity against influenza A virus infections by fitting individual-level mechanistic models to longitudinal serology from children and adults in a household cohort study. We find that most protection in children is explained by antibody titers measured by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. In contrast, in adults, HI antibody titers explain a smaller fraction of protection. Protection against circulating strains wanes to approximately 50% of peak levels 3.5-7 years after infection in both age groups, and wanes faster against influenza A(H3N2) than A(H1N1)pdm09. Protection against H3N2 lasts longer in adults than in children. Our results suggest that the focus of influenza antibody responses changes over time from the highly mutable hemagglutinin head to other epitopes, consistent with the immunological theory of original antigenic sin, and that this change of focus might affect protection. Additionally, we estimate that imprinting, or primary infection with a subtype of one phylogenetic group, has little to no effect on the risk of non-medically attended influenza infections in adults. We also find no evidence of long-term cross-protection between subtypes. This work underscores the need for longitudinal data on multiple components of the immune response to better understand the development of immunity and differences in susceptibility within populations.",

The ML framework of Long Short Term Memory - Recurrent Neural Networks works by isolating key weather events and genetic interactions which affect yield, seed oil, seed protein and maturity enabling prediction of genotypic responses in unseen environments.

    "abstract": "Our recent experimental results that combine a mouse model of influenza A virus (IAV) infection (A/H1N1/PR8) and a highly aggressive model of infection-unrelated cancer, B16-F10 skin melanoma, showed that acute influenza infection of the lung promotes distal melanoma growth in the dermis of the flank and leads to decreased host survival. Here, we proceed to ground the experimental observations in a mechanistic immunobiochemical model that incorporates the T cell receptor signaling pathway, various transcription factors, and a gene regulatory network (GRN). A core component of our model is a biochemical motif, which we call a Triple Incoherent Feed-Forward Loop (TIFFL), and which reflects known interactions between IRF4, Blimp-1, and Bcl-6. The different activity levels of the TIFFL components, as a function of the cognate antigen levels and the given inflammation context, manifest themselves in phenotypically distinct outcomes. Specifically, both the TIFFL reconstruction and quantitative estimates obtained from the model allowed us to formulate a hypothesis that it is the loss of the fundamental TIFFL-induced adaptation of the expression of PD-1 receptors on anti-melanoma CD8+ T cells that constitutes the essence of the previously unrecognized immunologic factor that promotes the experimentally observed distal tumor growth in the presence of acute non-ocogenic infection. We therefore hope that this work can further highlight the importance of adaptive mechanisms by which immune functions contribute to the balance between self and non-self immune tolerance, adaptive resistance, and the strength of TCR-induced activation, thus contributing to the understanding of a broader complexity of fundamental interactions between pathogens and tumors.",

    "abstract": "Pain is an unpleasant but necessary sensory experience, which facilitates adaptive behaviours, such as fear. Despite recent advances, the question of how the pain experience influences learning of the fear response is still debated1,2. Genetic disorders rendering patients congenitally unable to feel pain have been described, and are usually explained by defects in peripheral nociceptors3-5. It is not known how growing up without pain affects central emotional and motivational responses to aversive stimuli. The rare autosomal recessive Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy type V (HSAN V) is caused by a mutation in the nerve growth factor (NGF) gene (R100W). HSAN V homozygous patients display a congenital indifference to painful events, with deficits in peripheral nociceptors but without overt cognitive impairment6. In contrast, heterozygous carriers do not present with pain-related deficits and have been identified only through pedigree and genetic screening7,8. We exploited this clinically silent population to dissociate nociceptive from affective features of pain. To address this we investigated both heterozygous knock-in mice bearing the R100W mutation (NGFR100W/m mice) and a cohort of HSAN V heterozygous human carriers. Surprisingly, we found that NGFR100W/m mice, despite normal responses to a noxious conditioning stimulus, show a deficit in learned fear while their social and innate fear responses are normal. The lack of pain-related fear response was linked to a reduced activation of anterior cingulate and motor cortices and of striatum, but not in primary somatosensory cortex. Likewise, human heterozygous R100W carriers, despite perceiving noxious stimuli and reporting subjective pain thresholds, show increased reaction latencies in response to painful stimulation, alongside a decreased subjective urgency to react. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed, comparably to the mouse data, an altered processing of painful stimuli in rostral anterior cingulate, medial premotor cortical regions and striatum. These findings from both human and mouse HSAN V carriers uncover behavioural and motivational consequences of a mild genetic pain insensitivity on the establishment of pain-dependent affective responses and memories.",

    "abstract": "We used inhibitory DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) to reversibly disrupt dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) function in male macaque monkeys. Monkeys were tested on a spatial delayed response task to assess working memory function after intramuscular injection of either clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) or vehicle. CNO injections given before DREADD transduction were without effect on behavior. rAAV5/hsyn-hM4Di-mCherry was injected bilaterally into the dlPFC of five male rhesus monkeys, to produce neuronal expression of the inhibitory (Gi-coupled) DREADD receptor. We quantified the percentage of DREADD- transduced cells using stereological analysis of mCherry-immunolabeled cells. We found a greater number of immunolabeled neurons in monkeys that displayed CNO-induced behavioral impairment after DREADD transduction compared to monkeys that showed no behavioral effect after CNO. Even in monkeys that showed reliable effects of CNO on behavior after DREADD transduction, the number of prefrontal neurons transduced with DREADD receptor was on the order of 3% of total prefrontal neurons counted. This level of histological analysis facilitates our understanding of behavioral effects, or lack thereof, after DREADD vector injection in monkeys. It also implies that a functional silencing of a relatively small fraction of dlPFC neurons, albeit in a widely distributed area, is sufficient to disrupt spatial working memory.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCognitive domains such as working memory and executive function are mediated by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Impairments in these domains are common in neurodegenerative diseases as well as normal aging. The present study sought to measure deficits in a spatial delayed response task following activation of viral-vector transduced inhibitory DREADD (Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug) receptors in rhesus macaques and compare this to the level of transduction in dlPFC using stereology. We found a significant relationship between the extent of DREADD transduction and the magnitude of behavioral deficit following administration of the DREADD actuator compound clozapine-N- oxide (CNO). These results demonstrate it will be critical to validate transduction to ensure DREADDs remain a powerful tool for neuronal disruption.",

    "abstract": "The t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) method is one of the leading techniques for data visualization and clustering. This method finds lower dimensional embeddings of data points while minimizing distortions in distances between neighboring data points. By construction, t-SNE discards information about large scale structure of the data. We show that adding a global cost function to the t-SNE cost function makes it possible to cluster the data while preserving global inter-cluster data structure. We test the new \\\"global t-SNE\\\" (g-SNE) method on one synthetic and two real data sets on flowers and human brain cells which have significant and meaningful global structures. In all cases, g-SNE outperforms t-SNE in preserving the global structure. The weight parameter {lambda} of the global cost function determines the balance between local and global distances preservations. For the human brain atlas data set, we show the tradeoff of {lambda} in representing global structure of data. Using g-SNE with the optimized {lambda} may therefore yield biological insights into how data is organized on multiple scales. The MATLAB code is available at: https://github.com/gyrheart/gsne",

    "abstract": "Protein kinases are crucial to coordinate cellular decisions and therefore their activities are strictly regulated. We used ancestral resurrection to uncover a mechanism underlying the evolution of kinase control within the ERK family of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs). Kinase activities switched from high to low intrinsic autophosphorylation at the transition from the ancestors of ERKs1-5 and ERKs1-2. A shortening of the loop between {beta}3-C and a mutation in the gatekeeper residue drove this transition. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the change in the {beta}3-C loop length affected kinase cis-autophosphorylation by altering the positioning of catalytic residues and by allowing greater flexibility in the L16 kinase loop. This latter effect likely synergizes with the known role of gatekeeper mutations in facilitating domain closure and thus kinase activation, providing a rationale for the synergy between the two evolutionary mutations. Our results shed light on the evolutionary mechanisms that led to tight regulation of a central kinase in development and disease.",

The maximum catalytic activity of hydroxylase (MMOH) is achieved via interplay of its regulatory protein (MMOB) and reductase4-6. An additional auxiliary protein, MMOD, is believed to function as an inhibitor of the catalytic activity of MMOH; however, the mechanism of its action remains unknown7,8. Herein, we report the crystal structure of MMOH-MMOD complex from Methylosinus sporium strain 5 (2.6 [A]), which illustrates that two molecules of MMOD associate symmetrically with the canyon region of MMOH in a manner similar to MMOB, indicating that MMOD competes with MMOB for MMOH recognition. Further, MMOD binding disrupts the geometry of the di-iron centre and opens the substrate access channel. Notably, the electron density of 1,6-hexanediol at the substrate access channel mimics products of sMMO in hydrocarbon oxidation. The crystal structure of MMOH-MMOD unravels the inhibitory mechanism by which MMOD suppresses the MMOH catalytic activity, and reveals how hydrocarbon substrates/products access to the di-iron centre.",

While the effects on plasmid organization has been extensively studied for knotting and supercoiling taken separately, much less is known about their concurrent action. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations and oxDNA, an accurate mesoscopic DNA model, to study the kinetic and metric changes introduced by complex (five-crossing) knots and supercoiling in 2kbp-long DNA rings. We find several unexpected results. First, the conformational ensemble is dominated by two distinct states, differing in branchedness and knot size. Secondly, fluctuations between these states are as fast as the metric relaxation of unknotted rings. In spite of this, certain boundaries of knotted and plectonemically-wound regions can persist over much longer timescales. These pinned regions involve multiple strands that are interlocked by the cooperative action of topological and supercoiling constraints. Their long-lived character may be relevant for the simplifying action of topoisomerases.",

Here, we demonstrate that membrane depolarization and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation triggers secretion of the chemotropic guidance cue netrin-1 from dendrites. Using selective genetic deletion, we show that netrin-1 expression by excitatory neurons is required for NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the adult hippocampus. Further, we demonstrate that application of exogenous netrin-1 is sufficient to trigger the potentiation of excitatory glutamatergic transmission at hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses via Ca2+-dependent recruitment of GluA1-containing AMPARs, promoting the maturation of immature or nascent synapses. These findings identify a central role for activity-dependent release of netrin-1 as a critical effector of synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus.",

One strategy is to continuously adjust the sensitivity of neurons to suppress responses to common features of the input while enhancing responses to new ones. Here we image both the excitatory synaptic inputs and outputs of retinal ganglion cells to understand how such dynamic predictive coding is implemented in the analysis of spatial patterns. Synapses of bipolar cells become tuned to orientation through presynaptic inhibition generating lateral antagonism in the orientation domain. Individual ganglion cells receive excitatory synapses tuned to different orientations but feedforward inhibition generates a high-pass filter that only transmits the initial activation of these inputs, thereby removing redundancy. These results demonstrate how a dynamic predictive code can be implemented by circuit motifs common to many parts of the brain.",

    "abstract": "A common measure of multisensory integration is the McGurk effect, an illusion in which incongruent auditory and visual speech are integrated to produce an entirely different percept. Published studies report that participants who differ in age, gender, culture, native language, or traits related to neurological or psychiatric disorders also differ in their susceptibility to the McGurk effect. These group-level differences are used as evidence for fundamental alterations in sensory processing between populations. However, there is high variability in the McGurk effect within groups: some participants never report the illusion while others always do. High within-group variability means that sample sizes much larger than those in the published literature are necessary to accurately estimate between-group differences. Using empirical data and simulations, we show that a typical study with a sample size of 15 participants per group and a true group difference of 10% will report a group difference of 31%, an effect inflation of three-fold. Reducing the effect inflation by half requires increasing the sample size ten-fold, to 150 participants per group. The combination of within-group variability and small sizes explains two prominent features of the McGurk literature. First, group differences are inflated and highly variable across studies. Second, follow-up studies fail to replicate published reports of large between-group susceptibility differences because initial effect-size estimates are driven by statistical inflation rather than true group differences. These replication failures are especially problematic in studies of clinical populations because they have real-world consequences. Due to the high within-group variability, caution is essential when using the McGurk effect to assess deficits in clinical groups or propose treatment plans, such as training to improve sensory processing.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a microfluidic platform that enables single-cell mass and growth rate measurements upstream of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate paired single-cell biophysical and transcriptional data sets. Biophysical measurements are collected with a serial suspended microchannel resonator platform (sSMR) that utilizes automated fluidic state switching to load individual cells at fixed intervals, achieving a throughput of 120 cells per hour. Each single-cell is subsequently captured downstream for linked molecular analysis using an automated collection system. From linked measurements of a murine leukemia (L1210) and pro-B cell line (FL5.12), we identify gene expression signatures that correlate significantly with cell mass and growth rate. In particular, we find that both cell lines display a cell-cycle signature that correlates with cell mass, with early and late cell-cycle signatures significantly enriched amongst genes with negative and positive correlations with mass, respectively. FL5.12 cells also show a significant correlation between single-cell growth efficiency and a G1-S transition signature, providing additional transcriptional evidence for a phenomenon previously observed through biophysical measurements alone. Importantly, the throughput and speed of our platform allows for the characterization of phenotypes in dynamic cellular systems. As a proof-of-principle, we apply our system to characterize activated murine CD8+ T cells and uncover two unique features of CD8+ T cells as they become proliferative in response to activation: i) the level of coordination between cell cycle gene expression and cell mass increases, and ii) translation-related gene expression increases and shows a correlation with single-cell growth efficiency. Overall, our approach provides a new means of characterizing the transcriptional mechanisms of normal and dysfunctional cellular mass and growth rate regulation across a range of biological contexts.",

Here we introduce a fast and reliable predictor of binding affinity changes upon single point mutation, based on a random forest approach. Our method, iSEE, uses a limited number of interface Structure, Evolution and Energy-based features for the prediction. iSEE achieves, using only 31 features, a high prediction performance with a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.80 and a root mean square error of 1.41 kcal mol-1 on a diverse training dataset consisting of 1102 mutations in 57 protein-protein complexes. It competes with existing state-of-the-art methods on two blind test datasets. Predictions for a new dataset of 540 mutations in 58 protein complexes from the recently published SKEMPI 2.0 database reveals that none of the current methods perform well (PCC<0.4), although their combination does improve the predictions.

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing is widely used to study gene function and is being advanced for therapeutic applications. Structural rearrangements are a ubiquitous feature of cancers and their impact on CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing has not yet been systematically assessed. Utilising CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens for 163 cancer cell lines, we demonstrate that targeting tandem amplified regions is highly detrimental to cellular fitness, in contrast to amplifications caused by chromosomal duplications which have little to no effect. Genomically clustered Cas9 double-strand DNA breaks are associated with a strong gene-independent decrease in cell fitness. We systematically identified collateral vulnerabilities in 25% of cancer cells, introduced by tandem amplifications of tissue non-expressed genes. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of structural rearrangements in mediating the effect of CRISPR-Cas9-induced DNA damage, with implications for the use of CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology, and how resulting collateral vulnerabilities are a generalisable strategy to target cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "PU.1 is a dominant but transient regulator in early T-cell precursors and a potent transcriptional controller of developmentally important pro-T cell genes. Before T-lineage commitment, open chromatin is frequently occupied by PU.1, and many PU.1 sites lose accessibility when PU.1 is later downregulated. Pioneering activity of PU.1 was tested in in this developmentally dynamic context, by quantitating the relationships between PU.1 occupancy and site quality and accessibility as PU.1 levels naturally declined in pro-T cell development, and by using stage-specific gain and loss of function perturbations to relate binding to effects on target genes. PU.1 could bind closed genomic sites, but rapidly opened many of them, despite the absence of its frequent collaborators, C/EBP factors. The dynamic properties of PU.1 engagements implied that PU.1 binding affinity and concentration determine its occupancy choices, but with quantitative tradeoffs for occupancy between site sequence quality and stage-dependent site accessibility in chromatin. At non-promoter sites PU.1 binding criteria were more stringent than at promoters, and PU.1 was also much more effective as a transcriptional regulator at non-promoter sites where local chromatin accessibility depended on the presence of PU.1. Runx motifs and Runx1 binding were often linked to PU.1 at open sites, but highly expressed PU.1 could bind its sites without Runx1. Notably, closed chromatin presented a qualitative barrier to occupancy by the PU.1 DNA binding domain alone. Thus, effective pioneering at closed chromatin sites also depends on requirements beyond site recognition served by non-DNA binding domains of PU.1.",

    "abstract": "Following injury, the mammalian spinal cord forms a glial scar and fails to regenerate. In contrast, spinal cord tissue of vertebrate fish regenerates and restores function. Cord transection in zebrafish (Danio rerio) initially causes paralysis and neural cell death, with subsequent ependymal glial proliferation, extension of bipolar glia across the lesion, and neurogenesis. Axons extending from spared and nascent neurons along trans-lesional glial bridges restore functional connectivity. Here we report that glucocorticoids directly target the regeneration supporting changes in ependymal glia to inhibit neural repair. This effect is independent of hematogenic immune cells or microglia. Furthermore, glucocorticoid receptor signaling in ependymal glia is inversely regulated in rat models of spinal cord injury compared to zebrafish. The blockade of neural regeneration by glucocorticoids via a direct effect on ependymal glia has important clinical implications concerning the putative therapeutic benefit of corticosteroids in early management of spinal cord injury.",

    "abstract": "Inhibiting glycolysis remains an aspirational approach for the treatment of cancer. We recently demonstrated that SF2312, a natural product phosphonate antibiotic, is a potent inhibitor of the glycolytic enzyme Enolase with potential utility for the collateral lethality-based treatment of Enolase-deficient glioblastoma (GBM). However, phosphonates are anionic at physiological pH, limiting cell and tissue permeability. Here, we show that addition of pivaloyloxymethyl (POM) groups to SF2312 (POMSF) dramatically increases potency, leading to inhibition of glycolysis and killing of ENO1-deleted glioma cells in the low nM range. But the utility of POMSF in vivo is dose-limited by severe hemolytic anemia. A derivative, POMHEX, shows equipotency to POMSF without inducing hemolytic anemia. POMHEX can eradicate intracranial orthotopic ENO1-deleted tumors, despite sub-optimal pharmacokinetic properties. Taken together, our data provide in vivo proof-of-principal for collateral lethality in precision oncology and showcase POMHEX as a useful molecule for the study of glycolysis in cancer metabolism.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=104 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/331538_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (20K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b78ebcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fc0ccforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ad268corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bdee32_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Porcine parvovirus (PPV) is a DNA virus that causes reproductive failure in gilts and sows, resulting in embryonic and fetal losses worldwide. Epitope mapping of PPV is important for developing new vaccines. In this study, we used spot synthesis analysis for epitope mapping of the capsid proteins of PPV (NADL-2 strain) and correlated the findings with predictive data from immunoinformatics. The virus was exposed to three conditions prior to inoculation in pigs: native (untreated), high hydrostatic pressure (350 MPa for 1 h) at room temperature and high hydrostatic pressure (350 MPa for 1h) at -18 {degrees}C, compared with a commercial vaccine produced using inactivated PPV. The screening of serum samples detected 44 positive spots corresponding to 20 antigenic sites. Each type of inoculated antigen elicited a distinct epitope set. In silico prediction located linear and discontinuous epitopes in B cells that coincided with several epitopes detected in spot synthesis of sera from pigs that received different preparations of inoculum. The approach used here provided important information on the antibody/antigen interactions required to improve B cell responses to PPV and may be useful in developing novel strategies for producing new vaccines.\\n\\nAbbreviations3D, three dimensional; HHP, high hydrostatic pressure; ID, identification; IEDB, Immune Epitope Database; ORFs, open reading frames; p.i., post-infection; PPV, porcine parvovirus; RMSD, root-mean-square deviation of atomic positions; R(g), radius of gyration.

    "abstract": "There has been recent progress in predicting whether common verbal descriptors such as \\\"fishy\\\", \\\"floral\\\" or \\\"fruity\\\" apply to the smell of odorous molecules. However, the number of descriptors for which such a prediction is possible to date is very small compared to the large number of descriptors that have been suggested for the profiling of smells. We show here that the use of natural language semantic representations on a small set of general olfactory perceptual descriptors allows for the accurate inference of perceptual ratings for mono-molecular odorants over a large and potentially arbitrary set of descriptors. This is a noteworthy approach given that the prevailing view is that humans capacity to identify or characterize odors by name is poor [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Our methods, when combined with a molecule-to-ratings model using chemoinformatic features, also allow for the zero-shot learning inference [6, 7] of perceptual ratings for arbitrary molecules. We successfully applied our semantics-based approach to predict perceptual ratings with an accuracy higher than 0.5 for up to 70 olfactory perceptual descriptors in a well-known dataset, a ten-fold increase in the number of descriptors from previous attempts. Moreover we accurately predict paradigm odors of four common families of molecules with an AUC of up to 0.75. Our approach solves the need for the consuming task of handcrafting domain specific sets of descriptors in olfaction and collecting ratings for large numbers of descriptors and odorants [8, 9, 10, 11] while establishing that the semantic distance between descriptors defines the equivalent of an odorwheel.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPollen development is a strictly controlled post-meiotic process during which microspores differentiate into microgametophytes and profound structural and functional changes occur in organelles. Annexin 5 is a calcium- and lipid-binding protein that is highly expressed in pollen grains and regulates pollen development and physiology. To gain further insights into the role of ANN5 in Arabidopsis development, we performed detailed phenotypic characterization of Arabidopsis plants with modified ANN5 levels. In addition, interaction partners and subcellular localization of ANN5 were analyzed to investigate potential functions of ANN5 at cellular level.\\n\\nResultsHere, we report that RNAi-mediated suppression of ANN5 results in formation of smaller pollen grains, enhanced pollen lethality, and delayed pollen tube growth. ANN5 RNAi knockdown plants also displayed aberrant development during the transition from the vegetative to generative phase and during embryogenesis, reflected by delayed bolting time and reduced embryo size, respectively. At the subcellular level, ANN5 was delivered to the nucleus, nucleolus, and cytoplasm, and was frequently localized in plastid nucleoids, suggesting a likely role in interorganellar communication. Furthermore, ANN5-YFP co-immunoprecipitated with RABE1b, a putative GTPase, and interaction in planta was confirmed in plastidial nucleoids using FLIM-FRET analysis.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings let us to propose that ANN5 influences basal cell homeostasis via modulation of plastid activity during pollen maturation. We hypothesize that the role of ANN5 is to orchestrate the plastidial and nuclear genome activities via protein-protein interactions however not only in maturing pollen but also during the transition from the vegetative to the generative growth and embryo development.",
