    "abstract": "The breadth of the host range of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses is roughly comparable to the host range of double-stranded DNA viruses (dsDNA). Yet, general ssDNA sensing receptors that activate the immune system have not been unequivocally identified while numerous dsDNA sensing receptors are known. Here, we hypothesize that some of the Single-Stranded DNA Binding (SSB) proteins may act as receptors that detect single-stranded DNA from pathogens and activate the innate immune system. As the first test of our hypothesis, we checked whether human genes that are known to bind to ssDNA are potentially interferon-regulated. Out of the 102 human genes that are known to have ssDNA binding ability 23 genes show a more than two-fold increase in gene expression upon interferon treatment. Single-stranded DNA viruses are pathogens of not only animals but also of plants and protozoans. We used this information to further prioritize our candidate list to ssDNA binding genes that are common between the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and humans. Based on these strategies, we shortlist several promising candidate genes including the HMGB1 gene which could act as a ssDNA sensor that activates the immune system. Agreeably though we cannot establish a definitive role for these genes as ssDNA sensors of the immune system as yet, our preliminary analysis suggests the potential existence of ssDNA binding protein-like receptors (SLRs) that are worth investigating further.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrion of apicomplexan parasites is critical for parasite survival, although the full complement of proteins that localize to this organelle has not been defined. Here we undertake two independent approaches to elucidate the mitochondrial proteome of the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii. We identify 421 mitochondrial proteins, many of which lack homologs in the animals that these parasites infect, and most of which are important for parasite growth. We demonstrate that one such protein, termed TgApiCox25, is an important component of the parasite cytochrome c oxidase (COX) complex. We identify numerous other apicomplexan-specific components of COX, and conclude that apicomplexan COX, and apicomplexan mitochondria more generally, differ substantially in their protein composition from the hosts they infect. Our study highlights the diversity that exists in mitochondrial proteomes across the eukaryotic domain of life, and provides a foundation for defining unique aspects of mitochondrial biology in an important phylum of parasites.",

    "abstract": "Biosynthesis of the nucleotide sugar precursor dTDP-L-rhamnose is critical for the viability and virulence of many human pathogenic bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus; GAS) and Streptococcus mutans. Those pathogens require dTDP-L-rhamnose for the production of structurally similar rhamnose polysaccharides in their cell wall. Via heterologous expression in S. mutans, we confirm that GAS RmlB and RmlC are critical for dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis through their action as dTDP-glucose-4,6-dehydratase and dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose-3,5-epimerase enzymes, respectively. Complementation with GAS RmlB and RmlC containing specific point mutations corroborated the conservation of previous identified catalytic residues in these enzymes. Bio-layer interferometry was used to identify and confirm inhibitory lead compounds that bind to GAS dTDP-rhamnose biosynthesis enzymes RmlB, RmlC and GacA. One of the identified compounds, Ri03, inhibited growth of GAS as well as several other rhamnose-dependent streptococcal pathogens with an MIC50 of 120-410 M. We therefore conclude that inhibition of dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis such as Ri03 affect streptococcal viability and can serve as a lead compound for the development of a new class of antibiotics that targets dTDP-rhamnose biosynthesis in pathogenic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Learning of competing information after reactivation has the potential to disrupt memory reconsolidation and thus impair a consolidated memory. Yet this effect has rarely been detected in episodic memory. By introducing an additional retrieving cue to the target memory, the current study detected significant impairment on the reactivated episodic memory, in addition to an integration of new information to the old memory. However, while the integration effect followed the time window of reconsolidation disruption, the impairment effect did not. MEG measurements further revealed alpha power change during reactivation and post-reactivation learning which showed different correlation patterns with the integration and impairment effects, confirming that the two effects relied on different processes. Therefore, post-reactivation new learning disrupts episodic memory but not through reconsolidation disruption. Further findings that the impairment effect was correlated with participants voluntary inhibition ability suggest an inhibition-based memory updating process underlying post-reactivation new learning.",

    "abstract": "We study how the spatial structure of connectivity shapes synchronization in a system of coupled phase oscillators on a mammalian whole-brain network at the mesoscopic level. Complex structural connectivity of the mammalian brain is believed to underlie the versatility of neural computations. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas constructed from viral tracing experiments together with a new mapping algorithm reveals that the connectivity has a significant spatial dependence: the connection strength decreases with distance between the regions, following a power law. However, there are a number of residuals above the power-law fit, predominantly for long-range connections. We show how these strong connections between distal brain regions promote rapid transitions between highly localized synchronization and more global synchronization as the amount of dispersion in the frequency distribution changes. This may explain the brains ability to switch rapidly between global and modularized computations.",

    "abstract": "The ability to speak coherently is essential for effective communication but declines with age: older people more frequently produce tangential, off-topic speech. The cognitive factors underpinning this decline are poorly understood. We predicted that maintaining coherence relies on effective regulation of activated semantic knowledge about the world, and particularly on the selection of currently relevant semantic representations to drive speech production. To test this, we collected 840 speech samples along with measures of executive and semantic ability from 60 young and older adults, using a novel computational method to quantify coherence. Semantic selection ability predicted coherence, as did level of semantic knowledge and a measure of domain-general executive ability. These factors fully accounted for the age-related coherence deficit. Our results indicate that maintaining coherence in speech becomes more challenging as people age because they accumulate more knowledge but are less able to effectively regulate how it is activated and used.",

    "abstract": "Apparent motion is the perception of a motion created by rapidly presenting still frames in which objects are displaced in space. Observers can reliably discriminate the direction of apparent motion when inter-frame object displacement is below a certain limit, Dmax. Earlier studies of motion perception in humans found that Dmax scales with spatial element size, interpreting the relationship between the two as linear, and that Dmax appears to be lower-bounded at around 15 arcmin. Here, we run corresponding experiments in the praying mantis Sphodromantis lineola to investigate how Dmax scales with element size. We used moving random chequerboard patterns of varying element and displacement step sizes to elicit the optomotor response, a postural stabilization mechanism that causes mantids to lean in the direction of large-field motion. Subsequently, we calculated Dmax as the displacement step size corresponding to a 50% probability of detecting an optomotor response in the same direction as the stimulus. Our main findings are that mantis Dmax appears to scale as a power-law of element size and that, in contrast to humans, it does not appear to be lower-bounded. We present two models to explain these observations: a simple high-level model based on motion energy in the Fourier domain and a more detailed one based on the Reichardt Detector. The models present complementary intuitive and physiologically-realistic accounts of how Dmax scales with element size in insects.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryComputer monitors, smart phone screens and other forms of digital displays present a series of still images (frames) in which objects are displaced in small steps, tricking us into perceiving smooth motion. This illusion is referred to as \\\"apparent motion\\\", and for it to work effectively the magnitude of each displacement step must be smaller than a certain limit, referred to as Dmax. Previous studies have investigated the relationship between this limit and object size in humans and found that larger objects can be displaced in larger steps without affecting motion perception. In this work, we investigated the same relationship in the praying mantis Sphodromantis lineola by presenting them with moving chequerboard patterns on a computer monitor. Even though motion perception in humans and insects are believed to be explained equally well by the same underlying model, we found that Dmax scales with object size differently in mantids. These results suggest that there may be qualitative differences in how mantids perceive apparent motion compared to humans.",

    "abstract": "RNA editing is a post-transcription maturation process that diversifies genomically encoded information and can lead to diversity and complexity of transcriptome, especially in the brain. Thanks to next-generation sequencing technologies, a large number of editing sites have been identified in different species, especially in human, mouse and rat. While this mechanism is well described in mammals, only a few studies have been performed in the chicken. Here, we developed a rigorous computational strategy to identify RNA editing sites in eight different tissues of the chicken (brain, spleen, colon, lung, kidney, heart, testes and liver), based on RNA sequencing data alone. We identified 68 A-to-G editing sites in 46 genes. Only two of these were previously reported in chicken. We found no C-to-U sites, attesting the lack of this type of editing mechanism in the chicken. Similar to mammals, the editing sites were enriched in non-coding regions, rarely resulted in change of amino acids, showed a critical role in nervous system and had a low guanosine level upstream of the editing site and some enrichment downstream from the site. Moreover, in contrast to mammals, editing sites were weakly enriched in interspersed repeats and the frequency and editing ratio of non-synonymous sites were higher than those of synonymous sites.\\n\\nInterestingly, we found several tissue-specific edited genes including GABRA3, SORL1 and HTR1D in brain and RYR2 and FHOD3 in heart that were associated with functional processes relevant to the corresponding tissue. This finding highlighted the importance of the RNA editing in several chicken tissues, especially the brain. This study extends our understanding of RNA editing in chicken tissues and establish a foundation for further exploration of this process.",

The diversities and structures in pit mud were analyzed by using high-throughput sequencing based on Illumina Miseq platform. The results showed that the lactic acid in calcified pit mud was about 10 times higher than quality pit mud, and the calcium ions was about 20 times higher than quality pit mud. It could found a strange phenomenon, the calcified pit mud had more pyruvic acid and quality pit mud basically does not had this kind of material. The data analysis shown that the pit mud were detected prokaryotes 908 strains and the eukaryotes 226 strains. It was found that the Lactobacillus and Prevotella in calcified pit mud (the total of both increase 11 times) had a higher percentage. It can be guess that the lactic acid and metal ions would form lactic acid salt compounds and those compounds could affect the growth and reproduction of microbes in pit mud. This study provided a good comparison of physical and chemical properties between the calcified pit mud and the quality pit mud, which was significant for the maintenance of pit mud and the quality of liquor.

Several Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels are proposed to be expressed in arterial myocytes, but it is unclear if these proteins control physiological blood pressure and contribute to hypertension in vivo. We generated the first inducible, smooth muscle-specific knockout for a TRP channel, namely for PKD2 (TRPP1), to investigate arterial myocyte and blood pressure regulation by this protein. Using this model, we show that intravascular pressure and 1-receptors activate PKD2 channels in arterial myocytes of different systemic organs. PKD2 channel activation in arterial myocytes leads to an inward Na+ current, membrane depolarization and vasoconstriction. Inducible, smooth muscle cell-specific PKD2 knockout lowers both physiological blood pressure and hypertension and prevents pathological arterial remodeling during hypertension. In summary, we show for the first time that arterial myocyte PKD2 channels control systemic blood pressure and targeting reduces high blood pressure.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies in humans have demonstrated that action observation activates brain regions involved in sensory-motor control. A growing body of work has shown that action observation can also facilitate motor learning; observing a tutor undergoing motor learning results in functional plasticity within the motor system and gains in subsequent motor performance. However, the effects of observing motor learning extend beyond the motor domain. Converging evidence suggests that learning also results in somatosensory functional plasticity and somatosensory perceptual changes. This work has raised the possibility that the somatosensory system is also involved in motor learning that results from observation. Here we tested this hypothesis using a somatosensory perceptual training paradigm. If the somatosensory system is indeed involved in motor learning by observing, then improving subjects' somatosensory function before observation should enhance subsequent observation-related gains in motor performance. Subjects performed a proprioceptive discrimination task in which a robotic manipulandum moved the subjects passive upper limb and he or she made judgments about the position of the hand. Subjects in a Trained Learning group received trial-by-trial feedback to improve their proprioceptive acuity. Subjects in an Untrained Learning group performed the same task without feedback. All subjects then observed a learning video showing a tutor adapting her reaches to a left force field (FF). We found that subjects in the Trained Learning group, who had superior proprioceptive acuity prior to observation, benefited more from observing learning compared to subjects in the Untrained Learning group. Improving somatosensory function can therefore enhance subsequent observation-related gains in motor learning. This study provides further evidence in favor of the involvement of the somatosensory system in motor learning by observing.\\n\\nAbbreviationsThe authors report no financial interests or conflicts of interests.",

    "abstract": "Substantial progress in acquisition, processing, and analysis boosted the reliability of diffusion-weighted MRI and increased the accuracy of mapping white matter pathways with fiber tractography. Since the introduction of  region of interest (ROI) based virtual dissection by Conturo et al. in 1999, researchers have used tractography to identify white matter pathways, which faithfully represented previously known structures revealed by dyeing studies or post-mortem descriptions. The reconstructed streamlines are subjects of bundle-specific in vivo investigations to show differences between groups (e.g., comparing fractional anisotropy (FA) between patients and healthy controls) or to describe the relation between diffusion scalars and metrics of interest (e.g.: normal aging or changes due to learning). By applying a reverse strategy in using diffusion-weighted MRI tractography first, then supporting the findings with other techniques, we have identified a bilateral tract in the frontal cortex - the superoanterior fasciculus (SAF). The tract resembles the anterior shape of the cingulum bundle, but is located more frontally. To erase the chance that our findings are confounded by acquisition, processing or modeling artifacts, we analyzed a total of 421 subjects from four cohorts with different acquisition schemes and diverse processing pipelines. The findings were also completed with other non-MRI techniques, such as polarized light microscopy and dissection. Tractography results demonstrate a long pathway and are consistent among cohorts, while dissection indicates a series of U-shaped fibers connecting adjacent gyri. In conclusion, we hypothesize that these consecutive U-shaped fibers emerge to form a pathway, thereby resulting in a multicomponent bundle.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput experimental techniques have made possible the systematic sampling of the single mutation landscape for many proteins, defined as the change in protein fitness as the result of point mutation sequence changes. In a more limited number of cases, and for small proteins only, we also have nearly full coverage of all possible double mutants. By comparing the phenotypic effect of two simultaneous mutations with that of the individual amino acid changes, we can evaluate epistatic effects that reflect non-additive cooperative processes. The observation that epistatic residue pairs often are in contact in the 3D structure led to the hypothesis that a systematic epistatic screen contains sufficient information to identify the 3D fold of a protein. To test this hypothesis, we examined experimental double mutants for evidence of epistasis and identified residue contacts at 86% accuracy, including secondary structure elements and evidence for an alternative all--helical conformation. Positively epistatic contacts - corresponding to compensatory mutations, restoring fitness - were the most informative. Folded models generated from top-ranked epistatic pairs, when compared with the known structure, were accurate within 2.4 [A] over 53 residues, indicating the possibility that 3D protein folds can be determined experimentally with good accuracy from functional assays of mutant libraries, at least for small proteins.

    "abstract": "Background and Purpose: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR), the only ABC transporter functioning as a channel. Unique to CFTR are two highly conformationally dynamic regions: the regulatory extension (RE) and regulatory insertion (RI). Removal of the latter rescues the trafficking defect of CFTR with F508del, the most common CF-causing mutation.\\n\\nWe aimed here to assess the impact of RE removal (alone or with RI or genetic revertants) on F508del-CFTR traffic and how CFTR modulator drugs corrector VX-809/lumacaftor and potentiator VX-770/ivacaftor rescue these combined variants so as to gain insight into the mechanism of action (MoA) of these drugs.\\n\\nExperimental Approach. We generated {triangleup}RE and {triangleup}RI CFTR variants (with and without genetic revertants) by site-directed mutagenesis and used them to stably transfect BHK cell lines. We studied CFTR expression and stability by Western blotting and pulse-chase respectively, plasma membrane levels by cell surface biotinylation and channel activity by the iodide efflux technique.\\n\\nKey Results. Our data demonstrate that {triangleup}RI significantly enhanced rescue of F508del-CFTR by VX-809. Thus, while the presence of the regulatory insertion seems to be precluding full rescue of F508del-CFTR processing by VX-809, this region appears essential to rescue its function by VX-770, thus suggesting some contradictory role in rescue of F508del-CFTR by these two modulators. Nevertheless, this negative impact of RI removal on VX-770-stimulated currents on F508del-CFTR can be compensated by deletion of the regulatory extension which also leads to the stabilization of this mutant. We thus propose that, despite both these regions being conformationally active, RI precludes F508del-CFTR processing while RE affects mostly its stability and channel opening.\\n\\nSupporting Information: Additional figures with supplementary data",

    "abstract": "Telomeres have been proposed as a biomarker that integrates the impacts of different kinds of stress and adversity into a common currency. There has as yet been no overall comparison of how different classes of exposure associate with telomeres. We present a meta-analysis of the literature relating telomere measures to stresses and adversities in humans. The analysed dataset contained 543 associations from 138 studies involving 402,116 people. Overall, there was a weak association between telomere variables and exposures (greater adversity, shorter telomeres: r = -0.15, 95% CI - 0.18 to -0.11). This was not driven by any one type of exposure, since significant associations were found separately for physical diseases, environmental hazards, nutrition, psychiatric illness, smoking, physical activity, psychosocial and socioeconomic exposures. Methodological features of the studies did not explain any substantial proportion of the heterogeneity in association strength. There was, however, evidence consistent with publication bias, with unexpectedly strong negative associations reported by studies with small samples. Restricting analysis to sample sizes greater than 100 attenuated the overall association substantially (r = -0.09, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.05). Most studies were underpowered to detect the typical association magnitude. The literature is dominated by cross-sectional and correlational studies which makes causal interpretation problematic.",

    "abstract": "Most compartmental epidemic models can be represented using the Euler-Lotka renewal equation (RE). The value of the RE is not widely appreciated in the epidemiological modelling community, perhaps because its equivalence to standard models has not been presented rigorously in non-trivial cases. Here, we provide analytical expressions for the intrinsic generation interval distribution that must be used in the RE in order to yield epidemic dynamics that are identical to those of the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) compartmental model with Erlang-distributed latent and infectious periods. This class of models includes the standard (exponentially-distributed) SIR and SEIR models as special cases.",

    "abstract": "Identification of mechanisms underlying the incidence of psychiatric disorders has been hampered by the difficulty in discovering highly-predictive environmental risk factors. For example, prior efforts have failed to establish environmental effects predicting geospatial clustering of schizophrenia incidence beyond urban-rural differences. Here, we employ a novel statistical framework for decomposing the geospatial risk for schizophrenia based on locale of upbringing (place of residence, ages 0-7 years) and its synergistic effects with genetic liabilities (polygenic risk for schizophrenia). We use this statistical framework to analyze unprecedented geolocation and genotyping data in a case-cohort study of n=24,028 subjects, drawn from the 1.47 million Danish persons born between 1981 and 2005. Using this framework we estimate the effects of upbringing locale (E) and gene-by-locale interactions (GxE). After controlling for potential confounding variables, upbringing at high-risk locales increases the risk for schizophrenia on average by 122%, while GxE modulates genetic risk for schizophrenia on average by 78%. Within the boundaries of Copenhagen (the largest and most densely populated city of Denmark) specific locales vary substantially in their E and GxE effects, with hazard ratios ranging from 0.26 to 9.26 for E and from 0.20 to 5.95 for GxE. This study provides insight into the degree of geospatial clustering of schizophrenia risk, and our novel analytic procedure provides a framework for decomposing variation in geospatial risk into G, E, and GxE components.",

    "abstract": "Infection efficiency is a key epidemiological parameter that determines the proportion of pathogen spores able to infect and cause lesions once they have landed on a susceptible plant tissue. In this study, we present an improved method to measure infection efficiency of Zymoseptoria tritici using a replicated greenhouse experiment. Z. tritici is a fungal pathogen that infects wheat leaves and causes Septoria tritici blotch (STB), a major disease of wheat worldwide.\\n\\nWe devised an original experimental setup, where we (i) attached living wheat leaves to metal plates allowing for time-resolved imaging of disease progress in planta. Since lesions were continuously appearing, expanding and merging during the period of up to three weeks, daily measurements were necessary for accurate counting of lesions. We also (ii) used reference membranes to characterize the density and the spatial distribution of inoculated spores on leaf surfaces. In this way, we captured the relationship between the number of lesions and the number of viable spores deposited on the leaves and estimated the infection efficiency of about 4 % from the slope of this relationship.\\n\\nOur study provides a proof of principle for an accurate and reliable measurement of infection efficiency of Z. tritici. The method opens opportunities for determining the genetic basis of the component of quantitative resistance that suppresses infection efficiency. This knowledge would improve breeding for quantitative resistance against STB, a control measure considered more durable than deployment of major resistance genes.",
