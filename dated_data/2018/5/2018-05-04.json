    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite inclusion in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). Serotype 3 increased in carriage since the implementation of PCV13 in the United States, while invasive disease rates remain unchanged. We investigated the persistence of serotype 3 in carriage and disease, through genomic analyses of a global sample of 301 serotype 3 isolates of the Netherlands3-31 (PMEN31) clone CC180, combined with associated patient data and PCV utilization among countries of isolate collection. We assessed phenotypic variation between dominant clades in capsule charge (zeta potential), capsular polysaccharide shedding, and susceptibility to opsonophagocytic killing, which have previously been associated with carriage duration, invasiveness, and vaccine escape. We identify a recent shift in the CC180 population attributed to a lineage termed Clade II, which was estimated by Bayesian coalescent analysis to have first appeared in 1968 [95% HPD: 1939-1989] and increased in prevalence and effective population size thereafter. Clade II isolates are divergent from the pre-PCV13 serotype 3 population in non-capsular antigenic composition, competence, and antibiotic susceptibility, the last resulting from the acquisition of a Tn916-like conjugative transposon. Differences in recombination rates among clades correlated with variations in the ATP-binding subunit of Clp protease as well as amino acid substitutions in the comCDE operon. Opsonophagocytic killing assays elucidated the low observed efficacy of PCV13 against serotype 3. Variation in PCV13 use among sampled countries was not independently correlated with the CC180 population shift; therefore, genotypic and phenotypic differences in protein antigens and, in particular, antibiotic resistance may have contributed to the increase of Clade II. Our analysis emphasizes the need for routine, representative sampling of isolates from disperse geographic regions, including historically under-sampled areas. We also highlight the value of genomics in resolving antigenic and epidemiological variations within a serotype, which may have implications for future vaccine development.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryStreptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of bacterial pneumoniae, meningitis, and otitis media. Despite inclusion in the most recent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV13, serotype 3 remains epidemiologically important globally. We investigated the persistence of serotype 3 using whole-genome sequencing data form 301 isolates collected among 24 countries from 1993-2014. Through phylogenetic analysis, we identified three distinct lineages within a single clonal complex, CC180, and found one has recently emerged and grown in prevalence. We then compared genomic difference among lineages as well as variations in pneumococcal vaccine use among sampled countries. We found that the recently emerged lineage, termed Clade II, has a higher prevalence of antibiotic resistance compared to other lineages, diverse surface protein antigens, and a higher rate of recombination, a process by which bacteria can uptake and incorporate genetic material from its surroundings. Differences in vaccine use among sampled countries did not appear to be associated with the emergence of Clade II. We highlight the need to routine, representative sampling of bacterial isolates from diverse geographic areas and show the utility of genomic data in resolving epidemiological differences within a pathogen population.",

    "abstract": "Introgressions of Thinopyrum ponticum 7AgL chromosome segments, spanning 23%, 28% and 40% of the distal end of durum wheat 7AL arm, were previously shown to contain multiple beneficial gene(s)/QTL for yield-related traits, in addition to effective disease resistance (Lr19, Sr25) and quality (Yp) genes. In the present study, durum wheat near isogenic recombinant lines (NIRLs), harbouring each of the three introgressions, were included for the first time in multi-location field trials, to evaluate general and environment-specific effects of the alien chromatin on 26 yield-related traits. The results from nine different trials across contrasting environments of Italy, Morocco and South Australia over four years revealed that the overall impact of 7AgL introgressions into the tetraploid wheat background did not imply, except in one environment, major yield penalty. The comprehensive effect of the three 7AgL segments on individual yield-contributing traits, resulted in significant increases of biomass m-2 (+9%), spike number m-2 (+13%), grain number m-2 (+11%) and spikelet-1 (+8%), but also in a general, significant decrease of grain weight (-8%). When the separate NIRLs were analysed, each of the three 7AgL segments turned out to be associated with variation of specific yield components. The effects of the 40%-long segment proved to be the most stably expressed across environments and involved significant increases of spike and grain number m-2 (13% and 15%, respectively), grain number spike-1 (10%) and spike fertility index (46%), though accompanied by a significant decrease in thousand grain weight (-23%). In spite of this trade-off between grain number and grain weight, their interplay was such that in four trials, including dryer environments, a grain yield advantage was observed. This evidence, and comparison with the two other NIRLs, substantiates the hypothesized existence of major gene(s)/QTL for grain number in the most proximal 28-40% 7AgL region, exclusive to the 40%-long 7AgL introgression. The present study represents an important validation of the use of chromosomally engineered genetic stocks for durum wheat improvement, targeting not only disease resistance and quality traits but also relevant yield components.",

    "abstract": "Selenoproteins are a diverse class of proteins containing selenocysteine (Sec), the 21st amino acid, incorporated into proteins during translation through a unique recoding mechanism. Selenoproteins fulfil essential roles in several lineages, including vertebrates; yet, they are not ubiquitous across the tree of life. In particular, the fungal kingdom was thought to lack selenoproteins, a paradigm that we defy here. We show that the genetic machinery for Sec utilization is present in the genomes of five species belonging to diverse early-branching fungal phyla (Chytridiomycota, Zoopagomycota, and Mucoromycota). We identified several selenoprotein genes in each of these genomes, and we detected canonical Sec insertion RNA structures (SECIS elements) for some of them. The identified selenoproteins are known or predicted oxidoreductases, some of which are conserved in mammals. Phylogenetic analyses support a scenario of vertical inheritance of the Sec trait within eukaryotes and fungi. Sec was then lost in numerous independent events in various fungal lineages, even within Sec-containing phyla. Notably, Sec was lost at the base of Dikarya, resulting in the absence of this trait in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other well studied fungi. Our results indicate that, despite scattered occurrence, selenoproteins are found in all kingdoms of life.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriocins are ribosomally produced antimicrobial peptides that represent an untapped source of promising antibiotic alternatives. However, inherent challenges in isolation and identification of natural bacteriocins in substantial yield have limited their potential use as viable antimicrobial compounds. In this study, we have developed an overall pipeline for bacteriocin-derived compound design and testing that combines sequence-free prediction of bacteriocins using a machine-learning algorithm and a simple biophysical trait filter to generate minimal 20 amino acid peptide candidates that can be readily synthesized and evaluated for activity. We generated 28,895 total 20-mer peptides and scored them for charge, -helicity, and hydrophobic moment, allowing us to identify putative peptide sequences with the highest potential for interaction and activity against bacterial membranes. Of those, we selected sixteen sequences for synthesis and further study, and evaluated their antimicrobial, cytotoxicity, and hemolytic activities. We show that bacteriocin-based peptides with the overall highest scores for our biophysical parameters exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Our combined method incorporates machine learning and biophysical-based minimal region determination, to create an original approach to rapidly discover novel bacteriocin candidates amenable to rapid synthesis and evaluation for therapeutic use.",

    "abstract": "Inhaled anesthetics are a chemically diverse collection of hydrophobic molecules that robustly activate TWIK related K+ channels (TREK-1) and reversibly induce loss of consciousness. For a hundred years anesthetics were speculated to target cellular membranes, yet no plausible mechanism emerged to explain a membrane effect on ion channels. Here we show that inhaled anesthetics (chloroform and isoflurane) activate TREK-1 through disruption of palmitate-mediated localization of phospholipase D2 (PLD2) to lipid rafts and subsequent production of signaling lipid phosphatidic acid (PA). Catalytically dead PLD2 robustly blocks anesthetic TREK-1 currents in cell patch-clamp. Localization of PLD2 renders the anesthetic-insensitive TRAAK channel sensitive. General anesthetics chloroform, isoflurane, diethyl ether, xenon, and propofol disrupt lipid rafts and activate PLD2. In the whole brain of flies, anesthesia disrupts rafts and PLDnull flies resist anesthesia. Our results establish a membrane mediated target of inhaled anesthesia and suggest PA helps set anesthetic sensitivity in vivo.",

    "abstract": "A joint and integrated analysis of multi-site diffusion MRI (dMRI) datasets can dramatically increase the statistical power of neuroimaging studies and enable comparative studies pertaining to several brain disorders. However, dMRI data sets acquired on multiple scanners cannot be naively pooled for joint analysis due to scanner specific nonlinear effects as well as differences in acquisition parameters. Consequently, for joint analysis, the dMRI data has to be harmonized, which involves removing scanner-specific differences from the raw dMRI signal. In this work, we present a dMRI harmonization method that, when applied to multi-site data, is capable of removing scanner-specific effects, while accounting for minor differences in acquisition parameters such as b-value, spatial resolution and number of gradient directions in the dMRI data (typical for multi-site clinical research scans). We validate our algorithm on dMRI data acquired from two sites: Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) with 800 healthy adolescents (ages 8 to 22 years) and Brigham and Womens Hospital (BWH) with 70 healthy subjects (ages 14 to 54 years). In particular, we show that gender differences and maturation in different age groups are preserved after harmonization, as measured using effect sizes (small, medium and large), irrespective of the test sample size. Further, because we use matched control subjects from different scanners to estimate scanner-specific effects, we tested how many subjects are needed from each site to achieve best harmonization results. Our results indicate that at-least 16 to 18 well-matched healthy controls from each site are needed to reliably capture scanner related differences. The proposed method can thus be used for retrospective harmonization of raw dMRI data across sites despite differences in acquisition parameters, while preserving inter-subject anatomical variability.",

We devised an automated odor discrimination task for adult zebrafish based on olfactory conditioning of feeding behavior. Presentation of a conditioned odor (CS+), but not a neutral odor (CS-), was followed by food delivery at a specific location. Fish developed differential behavioral responses to CS+ and CS- within a few trials even when odors were similar. The behavioral response to the CS+ was complex and included components reminiscent of food search such as increased swimming speed and water surface sampling. Appetitive behavior was therefore quantified by a composite score that combined measurements of multiple behavioral parameters. Discrimination behavior was robust in different strains and learned preferences could overcome innate odor preferences. These results confirm that zebrafish can rapidly learn to make fine odor discriminations. The procedure is efficient and provides novel opportunities to dissect the neural mechanisms underlying olfactory discrimination and memory.",

Previous studies have shown that the HIV-1 envelope is a very low mobility environment with the diffusion of incorporated proteins two orders of magnitude slower than in plasma membrane. One of the reasons for this difference is thought to be due to HIV-1 membrane composition that is characterised by a high degree of rigidity and lipid packing. To further refine the model of the molecular mobility on HIV-1 surface, we here investigated the relative importance of membrane composition and curvature in Large Unilamellar Vesicles of different composition and size (0.2-1 m) by super-resolution STED microscopy-based fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (STED-FCS) analysis. We find that lipid composition and its rigidity but not membrane curvature play an important role in the decreased molecular mobility on vesicle surface thus confirming that this factor is an essential determinant of HIV-1 low surface mobility. Our results provide further insight into the dynamic properties of the surface of individual HIV-1 particles.",

Previous work demonstrated that Kelch and Cullin 3 function together in a Cullin 3-RING ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL3Kelch) to organize the ring canal cytoskeleton, presumably by targeting a substrate for proteolysis. Here, we use tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry to identify HtsRC as the CRL3Kelch ring canal substrate. CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of HtsRC revealed its requirement in the recruitment of the ring canal F-actin cytoskeleton. We present genetic evidence consistent with HtsRC being the CRL3Kelch substrate, as well as biochemical evidence indicating that HtsRC is ubiquitylated and degraded by the proteasome. Finally, we identify a short sequence motif in HtsRC that is necessary for Kelch binding. These findings uncover an unusual mechanism during development wherein a specialized cytoskeletal structure is regulated and remodeled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.",

    "abstract": "In natural environments, microbes are typically non-dividing. Such quiescent cells manage fleeting nutrients and gauge when intra- and extracellular resources permit division. Quantitative prediction of the division event as a function of nutritional status is currently achieved through phenomenological models for nutrient-rich, exponentially growing cultures. Such models, however, cannot predict the first division of cells under limiting nutrient availability. To address this, we analyzed the metabolic capability of starved Escherichia coli that were fed pulsed glucose at defined frequencies. Real-time metabolomics and microfluidic single-cell microscopy revealed unexpected, rapid protein and nucleic acid synthesis already in non-dividing cells. Additionally, the lag time to first division shortened as pulsing frequency increased. Here, we demonstrate that the first division from a non-dividing state occurs when the facilitating protein FtsZ reaches division-supporting concentration. A dynamic model quantitatively relates lag time to FtsZ synthesis from nutrient pulses and its protease-dependent degradation. Consistent with model predictions, lag time shortened when FtsZ synthesis was supplemented or protease inhibitors were added. Lag time prolonged when ftsZ was repressed or FtsZ degradation rate was increased. Thus, we provide a basis to quantitatively predict bacterial division using information about molecular determinants and the nutrient input.",

(1) Important aspects of variance are contained in neither model. (2) The analysis is complicated, making it hard to verify. We thus followed up with a simple approach for model comparison: crossvalidation. We find evidence that baseline fluctuations describe much of the variance, which are properly modeled by neither the original papers drift-diffusion model, nor simple ramp or step models. Moreover, we find that our straightforward analysis strategy prefers ramping models, both with and without trial-by-trial baseline fluctuations. Our analysis, implementable in a few lines of code, suggests the importance of simple analyses.",

    "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that normal human observers can exhibit  blindsight-like behavior: the ability to discriminate or identify a stimulus without being aware of it. However, we recently used a bias-free task to show that what looks like blindsight may in fact be an artifact of typical experimental paradigms susceptibility to response bias. While those findings challenge many previous reports of blindsight in normal observers, they do not rule out the possibility that different stimuli or techniques could reveal such perception without awareness. One particularly intriguing candidate for this unconscious perception is emotion processing, as processing of emotional stimuli (e.g. fearful/happy faces) has been reported to potentially bypass conscious visual circuits. Here we used the bias-free blindsight paradigm to investigate whether emotion processing might reveal  featural blindsight, i.e. the ability to identify a faces emotion without having introspective access to the task-relevant features of the face that led to the discrimination decision. However, despite the purported ability of emotional stimuli to bypass conscious visual processing, we saw no evidence for such emotion processing  featural blindsight: like in our previous study, as soon as participants could identify a faces emotion they reported introspective access to the task-relevant features, matching predictions of a Bayesian ideal observer. The present results challenge dominant theory, adding to the growing body of evidence that perceptual discrimination ability in the complete absence of introspective access may not be possible for neurologically intact observers.",

Fast-spiking interneurons strongly varied their activity with the estrus-cycle and estradiol in ovariectomized females, while regular-spiking excitatory neurons did not change. In vivo whole-cell recordings revealed a varying excitation-to-inhibition-ratio with estrus. In situ hybridization for estrogen receptor {beta} (Esr2) showed co-localization with parvalbumin-positive interneurons in deep cortical layers, mirroring the laminar distribution of our physiological findings. In vivo and in vitro experiments confirmed that estrogen acts locally to increase fast-spiking interneuron excitability through an estrogen receptor {beta} mechanism. We conclude that sex hormones powerfully modulate cortical inhibition in the female brain.",
