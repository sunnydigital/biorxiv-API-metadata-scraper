    "abstract": "BackgroundLeft atrial (LA) electro-anatomical remodeling and diameter increase in atrial fibrillation (AF) indicates disease progression and is associated with poor therapeutic success. Furthermore, AF leads to a hypercoagulable state, which in turn promotes the development of a substrate for AF and disease progression in the experimental setting. The aim of this study was to identify pathways associated with LA remodeling in AF patients using untargeted proteomics approach.\\n\\nMethodsPeripheral blood samples of 48 patients (62{+/-}10 years, 63% males, 59% persistent AF) undergoing AF catheter ablation were collected before ablation. 24 patients with left atrial low voltage areas (LVA), defined as <0.5 mV, and 24 patients without LVA were matched for age, gender and CHA2DS2-VASc score. Untargeted proteome analysis was performed using LC-ESI-Tandem mass spectrometry in a label free intensity based workflow. Significantly different abundant proteins were identified and used for pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction analysis.\\n\\nResultsAnalysis covered 280 non-redundant circulating plasma proteins. The presence of LVA correlated with 30 differentially abundant proteins of coagulation and complement cascade (q<0.05).\\n\\nConclusionsThis pilot proteomic study identified plasma protein candidates associated with electro-anatomical remodeling in AF and pointed towards an imbalance in coagulation and complement pathway, tissue remodeling and inflammation",

    "abstract": "Joost Vanoverbeke, Department of Biology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. Abstract: Biodiversity in natural systems can be maintained either because niche differentiation among competitors facilitates stable coexistence or because equal fitness among neutral species allows for their long-term co-occurrence despite a slow drift toward extinction. Whereas the relative importance of these two ecological mechanisms has been well-studied in the absence of evolution, the role of local adaptive evolution in maintaining biological diversity through these processes is less clear. Here we study the contribution of local adaptive evolution to coexistence in a landscape of interconnected patches subject to disturbance. Under these conditions, early colonists to empty patches following disturbance can often adapt to novel local conditions sufficiently fast to prevent successful colonization by other pre-adapted species. Over the long term, the iteration of these local-scale priority effects results in niche convergence of species at the regional scale even though species tend to monopolize local patches. Thus, the dynamics evolve from stable coexistence through niche differentiation to neutral co-occurrence at the landscape level while still maintaining strong local niche differentiation. Our model results show that neutrality can emerge at the regional scale from local, niche-based adaptive evolution, potentially resolving why ecologists often observe neutral distribution patterns at the landscape level despite strong niche divergence among local communities. Our results also demonstrate how local adaptive evolution can shape cryptic eco-evolutionary dynamics and thus alter the regional mechanisms that determine biological diversity and resistance to disturbance.",

Here, we present Spikeling, an open source {pound}25 in silico implementation of a spiking neuron that mimics a wide range of neuronal behaviours for classroom education and public neuroscience outreach. Spikeling is based on an Arduino microcontroller running the computationally efficient Izhikevich model of a spiking neuron. The microcontroller is connected to input ports that simulate synaptic excitation or inhibition, dials controlling current injection and noise levels, a photodiode that makes Spikeling light-sensitive and an LED and speaker that allows spikes to be seen and heard. Output ports provide access to variables such as membrane potential for recording in experiments or digital signals that can be used to excite other connected Spikelings. These features allow for the intuitive exploration of the function of neurons and networks. We also report our experience of using Spikeling as a teaching tool for undergraduate and graduate neuroscience education in Nigeria and the UK.",

    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 (MMP-2/-9) are key tissue remodeling enzymes that have multiple overlapping activities critical for wound healing and tumor progression in vivo. To overcome issues of redundancy, we created MMP-2/-9 double knockout (DKO) mice in the C57BL/6 background to examine wound healing. We then bred the DKO mice into the polyomavirus middle T (PyVmT) model of breast cancer to analyze the role of these enzymes in tumorigenesis. Breeding analyses indicated that significantly fewer DKO mice were born than predicted by Mendelian genetics and weaned DKO mice were growth compromised compared with wild type (WT) cohorts. Epithelial wound healing was dramatically delayed in adult DKO mice and when the DKO was combined with the PyVmT oncogene, we found that the biologically related process of mammary tumorigenesis was inhibited in a site-specific manner. To further examine the role of MMP-2/-9 in tumor progression, tumor cells derived from WT or DKO PyVmT transgenic tumors were grown in WT or DKO mice. Ratiometric activatable cell penetrating peptides (RACPPs) previously used to image cancer based on MMP-2/-9 activity were used to understand differences in MMP activity in WT or knockout syngeneic tumors in WT and KO animals. Analysis of an MMP-2 selective RACPP in WT or DKO mice bearing WT and DKO PyVmT tumor cells indicated that the genotype of the tumor cells was more important than the host stromal genotype in promoting MMP-2/-9 activity in the tumors in this model system. Additional complexities were revealed as the recruitment of host macrophages by the tumor cells was found to be the source of the tumor MMP-2/-9 activity and it is evident that MMP-2/-9 from both host and tumor is required for maximum signal using RACPP imaging for detection. We conclude that in the PyVmT model, the majority of MMP-2/-9 activity in mammary tumors is associated with host macrophages recruited into the tumor rather than that produced by the tumor cells themselves. Thus therapies that target tumor-associated macrophage functions have the potential to slow tumor progression.",

    "abstract": "The dopamine system is thought to provide a reward prediction error signal that facilitates reinforcement learning and reward-based choice in corticostriatal circuits. While it is believed that similar prediction error signals are also provided to temporal lobe memory systems, the impact of such signals on episodic memory encoding has not been fully characterized. Here we develop an incidental memory paradigm that allows us to 1) estimate the influence of reward prediction errors on the formation of episodic memories, 2) dissociate this influence from other factors such as surprise and uncertainty, 3) test the degree to which this influence depends on temporal correspondence between prediction error and memoranda presentation, and 4) determine the extent to which this influence is consolidation-dependent. We find that when choosing to gamble for potential rewards during a primary decision making task, people encode incidental memoranda more strongly even though they are not aware that their memory will be subsequently probed. Moreover, this strengthened encoding scales with the reward prediction error, and not overall reward, experienced selectively at the time of memoranda presentation (and not before or after). Finally, this strengthened encoding is identifiable within a few minutes and is not substantially enhanced after twenty-four hours, indicating that it is not consolidation-dependent. These results suggest a computationally and temporally specific role for putative dopaminergic reward prediction error signaling in memory formation.",

Notably, this species is capable of reducing a variety of transition-metal ions into functional nanoparticles, but exact mechanisms of nanoparticle biosynthesis remain ill-defined. We report two key factors of extracellular electron transfer by S. oneidensis, the outer membrane cytochrome, MtrC, and soluble redox shuttles (flavins), that affect Pd nanoparticle formation. Changes in the expression and availability of these electron transfer components drastically modulated particle phenotype, including particle synthesis rate, structure, and cellular localization. These relationships may serve as the basis for biologically tailoring Pd nanoparticle catalysts and could potentially be used to direct the biogenesis of other metal nanomaterials.",

Despite the importance of bacteria on larval development, very little is known about the interaction between bacteria and larvae in their true ecological context. Understanding their relationship and inter-dependence in the host fruit is important for the development of new pest control interfaces to deal with this pest.\\n\\nResults:\\n\\nWe find no negative effects on egg hatch or larval development brought about by the bacterial isolates tested. The various symbionts inhabiting the flys digestive system differ in their degree of contribution to the development of fly larvae depending on the given host and their sensitivity to induced inhibition caused by female produced antimicrobial peptides. These differences were observed not only at the genus or species level but also between isolates of the same species. We demonstrate how the microbiota from the mothers gut supports the development of larvae in the fruit host and show that larvae play a major role in spreading the bacterial contagion in the infected fruit itself. In addition, we present (for the first time) evidence for horizontal transfer of bacteria between larvae of different maternal origin that develop together in the same fruit.\\n\\nConclusions:\\n\\nLarvae play a major role in the spread and shaping of the microbial population in the fruit.

We developed the DISSEQT pipeline (DIStribution-based SEQuence space Time dynamics) for analyzing, visualizing and predicting the evolution of heterogeneous biological populations in multidimensional genetic space, suited for population-based modeling of deep sequencing and high-throughput data. DISSEQT is openly available on GitHub (https://github.com/rasmushenningsson/DISSEQT.jl) and Synapse (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11425758), covering the entire workflow from read alignment to visualization of results. DISSEQT is centered around robust dimension and model reduction algorithms for analysis of genotypic data with additional capabilities for including phenotypic features to explore dynamic genotype-phenotype maps. We illustrate its utility and capacity with examples from evolving RNA virus populations, which present on of the highest degrees of population heterogeneity found in nature. Using DISSEQT, we empirically reconstruct the evolutionary trajectories of evolving populations in sequence space and genotype-phenotype fitness landscapes. We show that while sequence space is vastly multidimensional, the relevant genetic space of evolving microbial populations is of intrinsically low dimension. In addition, evolutionary trajectories of these populations can be faithfully monitored to identify the key minority genotypes contributing most to evolution. Finally, we show that empirical fitness landscapes, when reconstructed to include minority variants, can predict phenotype from genotype with high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Mutation rates vary between species across several orders of magnitude, with larger organisms having the highest per-generation mutation rates. Hypotheses for this pattern typically invoke physiological or population-genetic constraints imposed on the molecular machinery preventing mutations1. However, continuing germline cell division in multicellular eukaryotes means that organisms with longer generation times and of larger size will leave more mutations to their offspring simply as a by-product of their increased lifespan2,3. Here, we deeply sequence the genomes of 30 owl monkeys (Aotus nancymaae) from 6 multi-generation pedigrees to demonstrate that paternal age is the major factor determining the number of de novo mutations in this species. We find that owl monkeys have an average mutation rate of 0.81 x 10-8 per site per generation, roughly 32% lower than the estimate in humans. Based on a simple model of reproductive longevity that does not require any changes to the mutational machinery, we show that this is the expected mutation rate in owl monkeys. We further demonstrate that our model predicts species-specific mutation rates in other primates, including study-specific mutation rates in humans based on the average paternal age. Our results suggest that variation in life history traits alone can explain variation in the per-generation mutation rate among primates, and perhaps among a wide range of multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional nucleoside modifications have long been recognized as key modulators of non-coding RNA structure and function. There is an emerging appreciation that the chemical modification of protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) also plays critical roles in the cell. Although there are over 100 known RNA modifications found in biology only a handful have been identified in mRNAs. We sought to identify and quantify modifications present in the mRNAs of yeast cells using a high throughput ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method that measures the levels of 36 types of RNA nucleosides in parallel. We detected the presence of six modified nucleosides in mRNAs at relatively high abundances: N7-methylguanosine, N6-methyladenosine, 2-O-methylguanosine, 2-O-methylcytosine, N4-acetylcytidine and 5-formylcytidine. Additionally, we investigated how the levels of mRNA modifications vary in response to cellular stress. We find that the concentrations of mRNA modifications including N6-methyladenosine and N4-acetylcytidine change in response to heat stress, glucose starvation and/or oxidative stress. This work expands the repertoire of potential chemical modifications in mRNAs, and utilizes a high-throughput approach to search for modifications that highlights the value of integrating mass-spectrometry tools in the mRNA modification discovery and characterization pipeline.",

Current word embedding-based approaches treat each stimulus word independently and thus ignore the influence of context on language understanding. In this work, we instead build encoding models using rich contextual representations derived from an LSTM language model. Our models show a significant improvement in encoding performance relative to state-of-the-art embeddings in nearly every brain area. By varying the amount of context used in the models and providing the models with distorted context, we show that this improvement is due to a combination of better word embeddings learned by the LSTM language model and contextual information. We are also able to use our models to map context sensitivity across the cortex. These results suggest that LSTM language models learn high-level representations that are related to representations in the human brain.",
