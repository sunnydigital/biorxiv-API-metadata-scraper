    "abstract": "A subset of the GABAA receptors expressed in recombinant systems and neurons is known to exhibit both constitutive- and agonist-induced gating. Two such receptors are the {delta}-subunit containing GABAA receptors 4{beta}1{delta} and 4{beta}3{delta}, which are expressed in adult rodent hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGCs). Here we show that the GABAA receptor mediated tonic current recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin in adult rodent DGGCs is almost exclusively mediated by constitutively active {delta}-subunit containing GABAA receptors and that the constitutive current is absent in recordings at 24 {degrees}C or in recordings at 34 {degrees}C including an intracellular inhibitor of protein kinase C. These factors simultaneously govern the efficacy of an orthosteric agonist at 4{beta}1/3{delta} receptors, Thio-THIP, in a reciprocal manner. In the absence of constitutive receptor activity, the efficacy of Thio-THIP was increased approximately four-fold relative to recording conditions that favors constitutive activity. Further, only under conditions of an absent constitutive current, the classified neutral antagonist gabazine (GBZ) alone, induced a tonic current in DGGCs (EC50 2.1 M). This effect of GBZ was not seen in recording conditions of high constitutive activity, was inhibited by picrotoxin (PTX), potentiated by DS2, completely absent in {delta}-/- mice and reduced in {beta}1-/- mice, but could not be replicated in human 4{beta}1/3{delta} receptors expressed recombinantly in HEK cells. We hypothesize that specific intracellular components in neurons interact with receptors to determine constitutive gating and receptor responsiveness to orthosteric ligands.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe presented data highlight how recording conditions for whole cell patch clamp analysis of 4{beta}1/3{delta} GABAA receptors can mask important pharmacological effects. Specifically, orthosteric agonists appear with reduced efficacy, and other ligands, here exemplified with the well-known antagonist GBZ, are misinterpreted as being inactive/neutral, although they could have effect in constitutively silent receptors. Unmasking of potential hidden effects are easily done using recording conditions of reduced kinase activity in a relevant neuronal context. It follows that in pathologies with changes in phosphorylation level of {delta}-subunit containing GABAA receptors, the efficacy of an agonist of these receptors, measured by whole-cell recordings in vitro, will not match the efficacy of the same agonist in an unperturbed neuron in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The multi-subunit GABA-gated chloride channels of the Cys-loop receptor family, known as GABAA receptors, function as the primary gatekeepers of fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. In addition to their role in controlling synaptic tone, these receptors are the targets of a vast array of therapeutic compounds that potentiate channel gating. Importantly, functional activity and pharmacological efficacy of GABAA receptors is coupled directly to the subunit composition. However, the absence of high resolution structural information precludes an explicit determination of the molecular mechanism of ligand binding to ion channel gating and modulation. Efforts to obtain this data are hindered largely by the lack of heterologous expression and purification protocols for high expressing receptor constructs. To address this issue, we describe a unique approach to identify bona fide functional GABAA receptor subunit combinations by using the Xenopus oocyte as an expression host in combination with fluorescence detection size exclusion chromatography. The results demonstrate that formation of a defined pentameric species is dependent on subunit composition. Furthermore, receptor subunits can tolerate large truncations in non-conserved M3/M4 cytoplasmic loop, although removal of N-linked glycosylation sites is negatively correlated with expression level. Additionally, we report methods to improve GABAA receptor expression in mammalian cell culture that employ recombinant baculovirus transduction. From these methods we have identified a well-behaving minimal functional construct for the 1/{beta}1 GABAA receptor subtype that can be purified in milligram quantities while retaining high affinity agonist binding activity.",

    "abstract": "The glyoxylate shunt bypasses the oxidative decarboxylation steps of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, thereby conserving carbon skeletons for biosynthesis. The branchpoint between the TCA cycle and the glyoxylate shunt is therefore widely considered to be one of the most important junctions in the whole of microbial metabolism. In Escherichia coli, AceK-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of the TCA cycle enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD), is necessary to redirect flux through the first enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt, isocitrate lyase (ICL). In contrast, Mycobacterial species lack AceK and employ a phosphorylation-insensitive isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) at the branchpoint. Flux partitioning here is controlled \\\"rheostatically\\\" through cross-activation of IDH by the product of ICL activity, glyoxylate. However, the opportunistic human pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, expresses IDH, ICD, ICL and AceK. Here, we present the structure, kinetics and regulation of each branchpoint enzyme. We show that flux partitioning is coordinated through reciprocal regulation of the enzymes involved, beautifully linking carbon flux with the availability of key gluconeogenic precursors in a way that cannot be extrapolated from an understanding of the branchpoint enzymes in other organisms.",

    "abstract": "The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line is a major expression system for the production of therapeutic proteins, the majority of which are glycoproteins, such as antibodies and erythropoietin (EPO). The characterization of the glycosylation profiles is critical to understand the important role of glycosylation on therapeutic glycoproteins from CHO cells. In this study, a large scale glycoproteomic workflow was established and applied to CHO-K1 cells expressing EPO. The workflow includes enrichment of intact glycopeptides from CHO-K1 cell lysate and medium using hydrophilic enrichment, fractionation of the obtained intact glycopeptides (IGPs) by basic reversed phase liquid chromatography (bRPLC), analyzing the glycopeptides using LC-MS/MS, and annotating the results by GPQuest 2.0. A total of 10,338 N-linked glycosite-containing IGPs were identified, representing 1,162 unique glycosites in 530 glycoproteins, including 71 unique atypical N-linked IGPs on 18 atypical N-glycosylation sequons with an overrepresentation of the N-X-C motifs. Moreover, we compared the glycoproteins from CHO cell lysate with those from medium using the in-depth N-linked glycoproteome data. The obtained large scale glycoproteomic data from intact N-linked glycopeptides in this study is complementary to the genomic, proteomic, and N-linked glycomic data previously reported for CHO cells. Our method has the potential to accelerate the production of recombinant therapeutic glycoproteins.",

    "abstract": "Both PDGF signaling and adhesion to fibronectin (FN) matrix have been implicated in the directional collective migration of Xenopus mesendoderm cells at gastrulation. However, mesendoderm explants cultured on FN-coated substrates migrate directionally even in the absence of a source of PDGF. Integrin adhesion has been reported to up-regulate PDGF ligand-independent signaling through the PDGF receptor (PDGFr) in cultured mammalian cells. In order to address whether a similar mechanism stimulates PDGFr signaling in the absence of PDGF-A ligand in amphibian mesendoderm, isolated cells were cultured on bacterial fusion proteins containing the Type-III repeats 9-11 of FN (GST-9.11). Type III9-11 contains the RGD and \\\"synergy\\\" (PPSRN) sites required for integrin 5{beta}1 adhesion and activation but lacks the PDGF-A ligand-binding site present in the full-length FN protein. In order to ensure mesendoderm was not exposed to PDGF in vivo prior to removal and culture in vitro, antisense morpholinos were used to inhibit normal expression of PDGF-A ligand in embryos. P-Akt levels were reduced two-fold when either the PDGFr- was knocked down or when cells were plated on GST-9.11a, which contains a point mutation (PPSRN>PPSAN) that prevents both full activation of integrin 5{beta}1 and cell spreading. Reduced expression of PDGFr- was accompanied by perturbations in tissue migration, cytoskeletal organization, polarity of cell protrusions, and focal adhesion area. Mesendoderm cells became rounded, and the actin and cytokeratin filaments appeared collapsed and often colocalized near the cell center. Taken together, these findings suggest that integrin adhesion to FN, acting in synergy with PDGFr-, is sufficient to elevate PI3K-Akt signaling in the mesendoderm even in the absence of the PDGF-A ligand, and to promote forward-directed protrusions and directional tissue migration.",
