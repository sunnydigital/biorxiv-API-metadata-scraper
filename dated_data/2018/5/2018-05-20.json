    "abstract": "Plasma proteins and activated immune cells are known contributors of vascular brain disorders. However, the mechanisms and routes involved are still unclear. In order to understand the cross-talk between plasma proteins and the brain, we knocked down circulating C1 inhibitor (C1INH) in wild-type (WT) mice using antisense-oligonucleotide (ASO) technique and examined the brain. C1INH is a plasma protein inhibitor of vascular inflammation induced by activation of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) and the complement system. This knockdown induced the activation of the KKS but spared the activation of the classical complement system. Activation of the KKS induced an upregulation of the bradykinin pathway in the periphery and the brain, resulting in hypotension. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, plasma protein extravasations, activated glial cells and elevated levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and iNOS were detected in brains of C1INH ASO treated mice. Infiltrating innate immune cells were evident, entering the brain through the lateral ventricle walls and the neurovascular units. The mice showed normal motor functions, however, cognition was impaired. Altogether, our results highlight the important role of regulated plasma-C1INH as a gatekeeper of the neurovascular system. Thus, manipulation of C1INH in neurovascular disorders might be therapeutically beneficial.",

    "abstract": "To make decisions, animals must evaluate outcomes of candidate choices by accessing memories of relevant experiences. Yet little is known about which experiences are considered or ignored during deliberation, which ultimately governs choice. Here, we propose a normative theory to predict which memories should be accessed at each moment to optimize future decisions. Using nonlocal \\\"replay\\\" of spatial locations in hippocampus as a window into memory access, we simulate a spatial navigation task where an agent accesses memories of locations sequentially, ordered by utility: how much extra reward would be earned due to the computation enabling better choices. This prioritization balances two desiderata: the need to evaluate imminent choices, vs. the gain from propagating newly encountered information to predecessor states. We show that this theory offers a unifying account of a range of hitherto disconnected findings in the place cell literature such as the balance of forward and reverse replay, biases in the replayed content, and effects of experience. Accordingly, various types of nonlocal events during behavior and rest are re-interpreted as instances of a single choice evaluation operation, unifying seemingly disparate proposed functions of replay including planning, learning and consolidation, and whose dysfunction may underlie pathologies like rumination and craving.",

    "abstract": "Empathy has received considerable attention from the field of cognitive and social neuroscience. A significant portion of these studies used the event-related potential (ERP) technique to study the mechanisms of empathy for pain in others in different conditions and clinical populations. These show that specific ERP components measured during the observation of pain in others are modulated by several factors and altered in clinical populations. However, issues present in this literature such as analytical flexibility and lack of type 1 error control raise doubts regarding the validity and reliability of these conclusions. The current study compiled the results and methodological characteristics of 40 studies using ERP to study empathy of pain in others. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that the centro-parietal P3 and late positive potential component are sensitive to the observation of pain in others, while the early N1 and N2 components are not reliably associated with vicarious pain observation. The review of the methodological characteristics shows that the presence of selective reporting, analytical flexibility and lack of type 1 error control compromise the interpretation of these results. The implication of these results for the study of empathy and potential solutions to improve future investigations are discussed.",

For this purpose it is necessary to choose a phylodynamic model. However, the resulting inferences are contingent on whether the model adequately describes key features of the data. Model adequacy methods allow formal rejection of a model if it cannot generate the main features of the data. We present TreeModelAdequacy (TMA), a package for the popular BEAST2 software, that allows assessing the adequacy of phylodynamic models. We illustrate its utility by analysing phylogenetic trees from two viral outbreaks of Ebola and H1N1 influenza. The main features of the Ebola data were adequately described by the coalescent exponential-growth model, whereas the H1N1 influenza data was best described by the birth-death SIR model.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral isolation is thought to arise early in speciation due to differential sexual and/or natural selection favoring different preferences and traits in different lineages. Alternatively, behavioral isolation can arise due to reinforcement favoring traits and preferences that prevent maladaptive hybridization. In darters, female preference for male coloration has been hypothesized to drive speciation, because behavioral isolation evolves before F1 inviability. However, as with many long-lived organisms, the fitness of second generation hybrids has not been assessed because raising animals to adulthood in the lab is challenging. Recently, reinforcement of male preferences has been implicated in darters because male preference for conspecific females is high in sympatry but absent in allopatry in multiple species pairs. The hypothesis that reinforcement accounts for behavioral isolation in sympatry assumes that hybridization and postzygotic isolation are present. Here, we used genomic and morphological data to demonstrate that hybridization is ongoing between orangethroat and rainbow darters and used hybrids collected from nature to measure postzygotic barriers across two hybrid generations. We observed sex ratio distortion in adult F1s and a dramatic reduction in backcross survival. Our findings indicate that selection to avoid hybridization promotes the evolution of male-driven behavioral isolation via reinforcement in this system.",

In our analysis of this region our findings challenge the notion that NMPs should coexpress Sox2 and T. We built a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on the embryo CLE and use it as a classification model to analyse the in vitro NMP-like populations. We showed that ESCs derived NMPs are heterogeneous and contain few NMP-like cells, whereas EpiSCs derived NMPs, produce a high proportion of cells with the embryo NMP signature. Importantly, we found that the population from which the Epi-NMPs are derived in culture, contains a nodelike population, which is responsible for maintaining the expression of T in vitro. These results mimic the events in vivo and suggest a sequence of events for the NMPs emergence.",

SANS studies of protein-detergent complexes usually require deuterium-labelled proteins or detergents, which in turn often lead to problems in their expression or purification. Here, we report an approach whose novelty is the combined analysis of SAXS and SANS data from an unlabeled membrane protein complex in solution in two complementary ways. Firstly, an explicit atomic analysis, including both protein and detergent molecules, using the program WAXSiS which has been adapted to predict SANS data. Secondly, the use of MONSA which allows to discriminate between detergent head- and tail-groups in an ab initio approach. Our approach is readily applicable to any detergent-solubilized protein and provides more detailed structural information on protein-detergent complexes from unlabeled samples than SAXS or SANS alone.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=196 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/324103_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (67K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f7e17corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f4987dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1475c79org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@839b9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, the mechanisms that temporally and spatially control the activation or repression of important genes during regeneration are not fully understood. To determine the role that chromatin modifiers play in regulating gene expression after tissue damage, we induced ablation in Drosophila imaginal wing discs, and screened for chromatin regulators that are required for epithelial tissue regeneration. Here we show that many of these genes are indeed important for promoting or constraining regeneration. Specifically, the two SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes play distinct roles in regulating different aspects of regeneration. The PBAP complex regulates regenerative growth and developmental timing, and is required for the expression of JNK signaling targets and the growth promoter Myc. By contrast, the BAP complex ensures correct patterning and cell fate by stabilizing expression of the posterior gene engrailed. Thus, both SWI/SNF complexes are essential for proper gene expression during tissue regeneration, but they play distinct roles in regulating growth and cell fate.\n\nSummary statementDuring regeneration of the Drosophila wing disc, the SWI/SNF PBAP complex is required for regenerative growth and expression of JNK signaling targets, while the BAP complex maintains posterior cell fate.",

    "abstract": "Type IV secretion systems are membrane-bound multiprotein complexes that mediate the translocation of macromolecules across the bacterial cell envelope. In Helicobacter pylori a type IV secretion system is encoded by the cag pathogenicity island that encodes 27 Cag proteins and most of these are essential for bacterial virulence. We here present our work on the identification and characterization of inhibitors of Cag, a hexameric ATPase and member of the family of VirB11-like proteins that is essential for translocation of the CagA cytotoxin into mammalian cells. We conducted fragment-based screening using a differential scanning fluorimetry assay and identified 16 molecules that stabilize the protein during thermal denaturation suggesting that they bind Cag. Several of these molecules affect binding of ADP and four of them inhibit the ATPase enzyme activity of Cag. Analysis of enzyme kinetics suggests that their mode of action is non-competitive, suggesting that they do not bind to the ATPase active site. Cross-linking analysis suggests that the active molecules change the conformation of the protein and gel filtration and transmission electron microscopy show that molecule 1G2 dissociates the Cag hexamer. Analysis by X-ray crystallography reveals that molecule 1G2 binds at the interface between Cag subunits. Addition of the molecule 1G2 inhibits the induction of interleukin-8 production in gastric cancer cells after co-incubation with H. pylori suggesting that it inhibits Cag in vivo. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for the inhibition of the ATPase activity of VirB11-like proteins and the identified molecules have potential for the development into antivirulence drugs.",

    "abstract": "Diversity of prion strains is one of the most mysterious traits of prions because they are mere aggregates of abnormally-folded forms of single protein species, prion protein (PrPSc), without genome. Although the strain-specific properties are hypothesized to be enciphered in the strain-specific structures of PrPSc instead of nucleotide genome, specifically what structure can code the information remains an enigma due to the incompatibility of PrPSc with structural analyses. Although the strain diversity was regarded as unique to prions, recently other disease-associated amyloids of -synuclein (Syn) or tau are also reported to have \\\"strains\\\". As detailed structures of Syn amyloid are already identified and the properties of mutant Syn associated with familial Parkinsons diseases, e.g. A53T, H50Q, and G51D, have been characterized, structure-phenotype relations of this type of amyloid could be investigated by using the Syn amyloid as a model. Here we intensively investigated the mutant Syn amyloids by molecular dynamics simulation to characterize influences of mutations on the structures of homo- or hetero-oligomer stacks of the amyloid. The simulations revealed directionality of the amyloid stack, remote effects of the mutations on distant {beta}-sheets, existence of at least two switchable interfaces/amyloid cores, and distinct effects of hetero-oligomerization depending on mutation types. Collectively, those findings implied a possible mechanism of the strain diversity of the amyloids which have multiple in-register parallel {beta}-sheets side-by-side, and support the view that their prion-like properties are inherent in the characteristic structures.

    "abstract": "The impact of infectious disease is often very different in juveniles and adults, but theory has focused on the drivers of stage-dependent defense in hosts rather than the potential for stage-dependent virulence evolution. Stage-structure has the potential to be important to the evolution of pathogens because it exposes parasites to heterogeneous environments in terms of both host characteristics and transmission routes. We develop a stage-structured (juvenile-adult) epidemiological model and examine the evolutionary outcomes of stage-specific virulence under the classic assumption of a transmission-virulence trade-off. We show that selection on virulence against adults remains consistent with the classic theory. However, the evolution of juvenile virulence is sensitive to both demography and transmission pathway with higher virulence against juveniles being favored either when the transmission pathway is assortative (juveniles preferentially interact together) and the juvenile stage is short, or in contrast when the transmission pathway is disassortative and the juvenile stage is long. These results highlight the potentially profound effects of host stage-structure on determining parasite virulence in nature. This new perspective may have broad implications for both understanding and managing disease severity.\n\nImpact summaryUnderstanding the evolution of parasite virulence remains one of the most important questions in evolutionary ecology. Virulence is often very different in young and old hosts, but previous theory has presumed that these differences are attributed to adaptation in host defense rather than parasite adaptation. However, stage-structure within host populations can expose parasites to heterogeneous environments, which may lead to differential selection on parasite virulence (stage-specific virulence). Surprisingly, no study has investigated the effects of hosts stage-structure on the evolution of stage-specific virulence. We present a theoretical analysis to examine when selection can favor higher virulence against juveniles (juvenile-virulence) versus adults (adult-virulence). Our key result is that higher juvenile-virulence is selected for either when the transmission is assortative within age classes and maturation is slow, or when the transmission is disassortative (occurring predominantly between-classes) and maturation is relatively fast. These at first sight contrasting outcomes can be understood as adaptation to the exploitation of the more available host stage. Although the data on assortativity in infectious disease systems is limited, empirical studies for the virulence of Great Island Virus in guillemots (Uria aalge) and for salmon louse in pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) are consistent with our predictions. Our work provides testable predictions for stage-specific virulence and presents a novel mechanism that may explain variation in virulence in nature. There are also management implications for conservation, public health, vaccination programs, and farming to understanding the drivers of stage dependent virulence.",

We developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species, including Tylonycteris pachypus, Pipistrellus abramus and Rhinolophus sinicus (hosts of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4, Pipistrellus-BatCoV HKU5 and SARS-related-CoV respectively), and tested their susceptibilities to MERS-CoVs, SARS-CoV and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E).

Critical residues for binding to MERS-CoV spike protein were mostly conserved in bat DPP4. DPP4 was expressed in the five bat cells susceptible to MERS-CoV, with significantly higher mRNA expression levels than those in non-susceptible cells (P=0.0174), supporting that DPP4 expression is critical for MERS-CoV infection in bats. However, overexpression of T. pachypus DPP4 failed to confer MERS-CoV susceptibility in T. pachypus cells, suggesting other cellular factors in determining viral replication. The broad cellular tropism of MERS-CoV should prompt further exploration of host diversity of related viruses to identify its ancestral origin.",

    "abstract": "Recalcitrant dermatophytoses are on the rise and recent publications have documented high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to TRB and squalene epoxidase (SQLE) mutations. However, literature correlating the laboratory the data with clinical response is lacking.\\n\\nThis study was conducted to study the clinico-mycological profile of tinea corporis and cruris, including antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) and SQLE mutation analysis and correlate these with clinical response to TRB. Skin scrapings of patients with tinea corporis with/without tinea cruris were subjected to species identification, AFST and SQLE gene analysis (on 15 isolates). KOH confirmed cases were started on TRB 250mg once a day (OD). If >50% clinical clearance was achieved by 3 weeks; the same dose was continued.(Group 1). If clinical clearance at 3 weeks was <50%, the dose was increased to 250mg twice a day (BD) (Group 2). If the response still remained below 50% after 3 weeks of BD, the patients were treated with itraconazole (ITR)(Group 3). Trichophyton interdigitale was confirmed on all 64 isolates obtained on culture. Forty four (68.7%) isolates had high ([&ge;]1 g/ml) MICs to TRB. Six isolates were found to have aminoacid substitution Leu393Phe in SQLE protein, while one had the substitution Phe397Leu. The difference in modal MICs to TRB between the 3 clinical response groups (1.5157g/ml, 5.0396 g/ml and 20.1587g/ml respectively for group 1,2 and 3) was highly significant. Clinical response was achieved in 68% of those resistant by MIC data, and 42.8% of SQLE mutation harboring isolates, by increasing drug (TRB) exposure.\\n\\nWe infer that TRB resistance in dermatophytes has reached alarming proportions in our patients. Though improved outcomes were achieved with higher drug exposure, with the high failure rate seen in the study, the case for shifting to another class of antifungals as first line agent against dermatophytoses is strong.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we developed a method for simultaneous bio-methanation of CO2 and CO with H2 in a single bioreactor using a combination of carboxydotrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea for industrial applications. Methanogenic archaea generally use H2 and CO2 to produce methane, whereas very few methanogenic archaea methanize CO, and these grow slowly and consequently produce low reactant gas turnover rates. Thus, to achieve fast and simultaneous transformation of CO and CO2, we identified a combination of carboxydotrophic and hydrogenogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea that can produce H2 and CO2 from CO, and then methanize CO2 and H2. The present screening experiments identified carboxydotrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea that can cohabitate at the same thermophilic temperature and pH ranges and in the same growth medium. In these experiments, combinations of Carboxydocella thermautotrophica (DSM 12326), Carboxydocella sporoproducens (DSM 16521), and three thermophilic rod-shaped methanogenic archaeal cultures from MicroPyros GmbH formed unique microbial co-cultures that transformed CO2, H2, and CO to methane. The successful combination of these microbes could be used to gasify biowastes, such as sewage sludge, as alternative sources of hydrogen for microbial power-to-gas processes. Accordingly, gasification under these conditions produced H2-rich gas containing CO2 and CO, theoretically allowing various types of biowastes to be converted to biomethane, which is CO2-neutral, storable, and widely applicable as an energy source.",

    "abstract": "Polyphenism, the extreme form of developmental plasticity, is the ability of a genotype to produce discrete morphologies matched to alternative environments. Because polyphenism is likely to be under switch-like molecular control, a comparative genetic approach could reveal the molecular targets of plasticity evolution. In the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, which form two alternative feeding-morphs, the polyphenism threshold is set by relative dosage of two lineage-specific enzymes that respond to morph-inducing cues. One enzyme, the sulfotransferase SEUD-1, integrates an intercellular signalling mechanism at its ultimate target, the cells producing dimorphic mouthparts. Additionally, multiple alterations of seud-1 support it as a potential target for plasticity evolution. First, a recent duplication of seud-1 in a sister species reveals a direct correlation between genomic dosage and the polyphenism threshold. Second, laboratory selection on the polyphenism threshold resulted in changes in relative transcriptional dosage. Our study thus offers a genetic explanation for how plastic responses evolve.",

    "abstract": "Negative regulator of reactive oxygen species (NRROS, previously called LRRC33) is a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain containing, ER-resident transmembrane protein expressed primarily in lymphoid organs, especially in myeloid cells. We have previously demonstrated that NRROS regulates reactive oxygen species production by phagocytic cells by mediating degradation of NOX2 (gp91phox), a component of NOX2 complex responsible for the oxidative burst in these cells. Since LRR is the only functional domain in NRROS, it is likely to interact with other proteins for its biological functions. Here, by performing immunoprecipitation of NRROS and mass spectrometric analysis, we describe the NRROS interactome in macrophages and demonstrate that NRROS interacts with molecular chaperones/co-chaperones and mediators of the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) pathway such as calnexin, suggesting a broader role for NRROS in protein biosynthesis and the ER quality control machinery.",

    "abstract": "Mutation of the daf-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor activates the DAF-16/Foxo transcription factor to suppress the transgenerational sterility phenotype of prg-1/piRNA mutants that are deficient for piRNA-mediated genome silencing. As with PRG-1/piRNAs, mutations in the nuclear RNA interference gene nrde-1 compromised germ cell immortality, but deficiency for daf-2 did not suppress the transgenerational sterility of nrde-1 or nrde-4 single mutants or of prg-1; nrde-4 or prg-1; hrde-1 double mutants. NRDE-1 and NRDE-4 promote transcriptional silencing in somatic cells via the nuclear Argonaute protein NRDE-3, which was dispensable for germ cell immortality. However, daf-2 deficiency failed to promote germ cell immortality in prg-1; nrde-3 mutants. Consistently, we found that DAF-16 activity in somatic cells suppressed the transgenerational sterility of prg-1 mutants via the SID-1 dsRNA transmembrane channel that promotes systemic RNAi as well as Dicer, the dsRNA binding protein RDE-4 and the RDRP RRF-3. We conclude that DAF-16 activates a cell-non-autonomous systemic RNAi pathway that promotes small RNA-mediated genome silencing in germ cells to suppress loss of the genomic immune surveillance factor Piwi/PRG-1.",
