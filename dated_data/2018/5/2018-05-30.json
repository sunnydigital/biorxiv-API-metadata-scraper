    "abstract": "Many DNA methylome profiling methods cannot distinguish between 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Since 5mC typically acts as a repressive mark whereas 5hmC is an intermediate form during active demethylation, the inability to separate their signals could lead to incorrect interpretation of the data. Meanwhile, many analysis pipelines quantify methylation level by the count or ratio of methylated reads, but the proportion of discordant reads (PDR) has recently been proposed to be a better indicator of gene expression level. Is the amount of extra information contained in 5hmC signals and PDR worth the additional experimental and computational costs? Here we combine whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and oxidative WGBS (oxWGBS) data in normal human lung and liver tissues and their paired tumors to investigate the quantitative relationships between gene expression and signals of the two forms of DNA methylation at promoters, transcript bodies, and immediate downstream regions. We find that 5mC and 5hmC signals correlate with gene expression in the same direction in most samples, but considering both types of signals increases the accuracy of expression levels inferred from methylation data by a median of 18.2% as compared to having only standard WGBS data, showing that the two forms of methylation provide complementary information about gene expression. In addition, differential analysis between matched tumor and normal pairs is particularly affected by the superposition of 5mC and 5hmC signals in WGBS data, with at least 25-40% of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) identified from 5mC signals not detected from WGBS data. We do not find PDR to be more informative about expression levels than ratio of methylated reads, and integrating the two types of methylation features only improves the accuracy of inferred expression levels by at most 9.8%. Our results also confirm previous finding that methylation signals at transcript bodies are more indicative of gene expression levels than promoter methylation signals, and further show that in addition to the first exon, methylation signals at the last exon and internal introns also contain non-redundant information about gene expression. Overall, our study provides concrete data for evaluating the cost effectiveness of some experimental and analysis options in the study of DNA methylation in normal and cancer samples.",

    "abstract": "Chronic skin inflammation including psoriasis is a multisystem disease, affecting more than 5% of the general population. Here we show that Pellino 1 (Peli1), a signal-responsive ubiquitin E3 ligase, is highly up-regulated in human psoriatic skin lesions and that increased Peli1 expression correlates with the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis-like chronic skin inflammatory disease. Interestingly, Peli1 directly interacts with interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4, a transcription factor that plays pivotal roles in proliferation and cytokine production) and induces lysine 63-mediated ubiquitination. Peli1-mediated IRF4 ubiquitination appears to be a common systemic signaling mechanism shared by lesional keratinocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells, generating a feedback relationship between keratinocyte and Th17 cell responses. Conversely, inhibition of Peli1 interferes with IRF4 induction and attenuates immunopathogenic signaling in the psoriasis. In summary, Peli1-mediated ubiquitination is a common immunopathogenic intercellular signaling in psoriasis-like chronic skin inflammatory microenvironment. Thus, targeting Peli1 could be used as a potential strategy for psoriasis treatment.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils, an important component of the innate immune system, release extracellular traps (NETs) to eliminate invaded pathogens by trapping and killing microbes. A dysfunctional innate immune response is a major cause of persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HBV has been shown to reduce neutrophil responses. The objectives of the present study were to determine whether HBV influenced NETs release and to identify the underlying mechanisms. Primary neutrophils and circulating blood samples were collected from 40 patients with a chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB) and 40 healthy controls to detect NETs release using a Quant-iT Pico Green dsDNA assay and to determine the levels of HBV-DNA and HBV markers. NETs release was decreased in patients with a CHB infection, and hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B core antibody levels negatively correlated with NETs release. The Quant-iT Pico Green dsDNA assay and western blotting were used to examine the effect of HBV proteins (HBV X protein, HBV C protein, HBV E protein and HBV S protein) on NETs release in vitro. Based on the flow cytometry and western blot data, HBV C protein and HBV E protein inhibited NETs release by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and autophagy. Overall, HBV may inhibit NETs release by modulating ROS production and autophagy to escape the immune system and promote the establishment of a chronic infection.",

    "abstract": "The methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina barkeri encodes three distinct types of hydrogenase, whose functions vary depending on the growth substrate. These include the F420-dependent (Frh), methanophenazine-dependent (Vht), and ferredoxin-dependent (Ech) hydrogenases. To investigate their physiological roles, we characterized a series of mutants lacking each hydrogenase in various combinations. Mutants lacking Frh, Vht, or Ech in any combination failed to grow on H2/CO2, whereas only Vht and Ech were essential for growth on acetate. In contrast, a mutant lacking all three grew on methanol with a final growth yield similar to wild-type, produced methane and CO2 in the expected 3:1 ratio, but had a ca. 33% slower growth rate. Thus, hydrogenases play a significant, but non-essential, role during growth on this substrate. As previously observed, mutants lacking Ech fail to grow on methanol/H2 unless supplemented with biosynthetic precursors. Interestingly, this phenotype was abolished in the {Delta}ech/{Delta}frh and {Delta}ech/{Delta}frh/{Delta}vht mutants, consistent with the idea that hydrogenases inhibit methanol oxidation in the presence of H2, which prevents production of reducing equivalents needed for biosynthesis. Quantification of methane and CO2 produced from methanol by resting cell suspensions of various mutants supports this conclusion. Based on global transcriptional profiles, none of the hydrogenases are upregulated to compensate for loss of the others. However, transcript levels of the F420 dehydrogenase operon were significantly higher in all strains lacking frh, suggesting a mechanism to sense the redox state of F420. The roles of the hydrogenases in energy conservation during growth with each methanogenic pathway are discussed.",

Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the Vitek 2 system and micro-broth dilution method. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were used to analyse the genetic relatedness of isolates.

The ST37 strain exhibited multi-drug resistance genes and resistance to carbapenem. MLST and PFGE showed that 15 strains were divided into three groups, with a high level of homology. Gene sequencing and analysis indicated that KPN1343 harboured 12 resistance genes, 15 genomic islands and 205 reduced virulence genes.

    "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is a key component of human memory and cognition. Computational models have been used to study the underlying neural mechanisms, but neglected the important role of short- and long-term memory interactions (STM, LTM) for WM. Here, we investigate these using a novel multi-area spiking neural network model of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and two parieto-temporal cortical areas based on macaque data. We propose a WM indexing theory that explains how PFC could associate, maintain and update multi-modal LTM representations. Our simulations demonstrate how simultaneous, brief multi-modal memory cues could build a temporary joint memory representation as an \\\"index\\\" in PFC by means of fast Hebbian synaptic plasticity. This index can then reactivate spontaneously and thereby reactivate the associated LTM representations. Cueing one LTM item rapidly pattern-completes the associated un-cued item via PFC. The PFC-STM network updates flexibly as new stimuli arrive thereby gradually over-writing older representations.",

    "abstract": "Webers law states that the discriminability between two stimulus intensities depends only on their ratio. Despite its status as the cornerstone of psychophysics, the mecha-nisms underlying Webers law are still debated, as no principled way exists to choose between its many proposed alternative explanations. We studied this problem training rats to discriminate the lateralization of sounds of different overall level. We found that the rats discrimination accuracy in this task is level-invariant, consistent with Webers law. Surprisingly, the shape of the reaction time distributions is also level-invariant, implying that the only behavioral effect of changes in the overall level of the sounds is a uniform scaling of time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Webers law breaks down if the stimulus duration is capped at values shorter than the typical reaction time. Together, these facts suggest that Webers law is associated to a process of bounded evidence accumulation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that, among a broad class of sequential sampling models, the only robust mechanism consistent with reaction time scale-invariance is based on perfect accumulation of evidence up to a constant bound, Poisson-like statistics, and a power-law encoding of stimulus intensity. Fits of a minimal diffusion model with these characteristics describe the rats performance and reaction time distributions with virtually no error. Various manipulations of motivation were unable to alter the rats psychometric function, demonstrating the stability of the just-noticeable-difference and suggesting that, at least under some conditions, the bound for evidence accumulation can set a hard limit on discrimination accuracy. Our results establish the mechanistic foundation of the process of intensity discrimination and clarify the factors that limit the precision of sensory systems.",

Depending on the strength of this disinhibition (simulating VIP activity), network dynamics support multiple-item working memory (WM, strong disinhibition) or decision making (DM, weak disinhibition). Within these regimes, disinhibition controls WM capacity and speedaccuracy-trade-off in choice behavior.

    "abstract": "The mesolimbic dopamine projection from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key pathway for reward-driven learning, and for the motivation to work for more rewards. VTA dopamine cell firing can encode reward prediction errors (RPEs1,2), vital learning signals in computational theories of adaptive behavior. However, NAc dopamine release more closely resembles reward expectation (value), a motivational signal that invigorates approach behaviors3-7. This discrepancy might be due to distinct behavioral contexts: VTA dopamine cells have been recorded under head-fixed conditions, while NAc dopamine release has been measured in actively-moving subjects. Alternatively the mismatch may reflect changes in the tonic firing of dopamine cells8, or a fundamental dissociation between firing and release. Here we directly compare dopamine cell firing and release in the same adaptive decision-making task. We show that dopamine release covaries with reward expectation in two specific forebrain hotspots, NAc core and ventral prelimbic cortex. Yet the firing rates of optogenetically-identified VTA dopamine cells did not correlate with reward expectation, but instead showed transient, error-like responses to unexpected cues. We conclude that critical motivation-related dopamine dynamics do not arise from VTA dopamine cell firing, and may instead reflect local influences over forebrain dopamine varicosities.",

The present study sought neural evidence for age-related change in these factors by measuring neural differentiation during encoding of paired associates, and changes in regional BOLD activity and functional connectivity during retrieval conditions that placed low (intact pairs) and high (recombined pairs) demands on controlled retrieval processes. Pattern similarity analysis revealed age-related declines in the differentiation of stimulus representations at encoding, manifesting as both reduced pattern similarity between closely related events, and increased pattern similarity between distinct events. During retrieval, both groups exhibited increased recruitment of areas within the core recollection network, including the hippocampus and angular gyrus, when endorsing studied pairs, whereas younger adults exhibited increased recruitment of, and hippocampal connectivity with, lateral prefrontal regions during correct rejections of recombined pairs. These results provide evidence for age-related changes in representational quality and in the neural mechanisms supporting memory retrieval under conditions of high, but not low, control demand.",

    "abstract": "Humans copy other people without their conscious awareness, a behaviour known as automatic imitation. Although automatic imitation forms a key part of daily social interactions, we do not copy other people indiscriminately. Instead, we control imitative tendencies by prioritising some actions and inhibiting others. To date, neuroimaging studies investigating the control of automatic imitation have produced inconsistent findings. Some studies suggest that imitation control relies on a domain-specific neural circuit related to social cognition (the theory-of-mind network). In contrast, other studies show engagement of a domain-general neural circuit that is engaged during a diverse range of cognitive control tasks (the multiple demand network). Given the inconsistency of prior findings, in the current paper we avoided problems associated with interpreting individual studies by performing a meta-analysis. To do so, we used a multi-level kernel density analysis to quantitatively identify consistent patterns of activation across functional magnetic resonance imaging studies investigating the control of imitation. Our results show clear and consistent evidence across studies that the control of automatic imitation is guided by brain regions in the multiple demand network including dorsolateral frontoparietal cortex. In contrast, there was only limited evidence that regions in the theory of mind network were engaged. Indeed, medial prefrontal cortex showed no consistent engagement and right temporoparietal junction engagement may reflect spatial rather than imitative control. As such, the current meta-analysis reinforces the role of domain-general control mechanisms and provides limited evidence in support of the role of domain-specific processes in regulating imitative tendencies. Consequently, neurocognitive models of imitation need updating to place more emphasis on domain-general control mechanisms, as well as to consider more complex organisational structures of control, which may involve contributions from multiple cognitive systems.",

    "abstract": "Texture perception is one of the most important factors in food acceptance, yet population-wide differences in texture sensations are not well understood. The variation in texture perception across populations is thought to depend on oral tactile sensitivity and oral processing behaviors. To address this hypothesis, we aimed to measure tactile acuity with a battery of tests and quantitate the relationship to oral processing. The study was performed on 98 participants, in 3 age groups (20-25, 35-45, or over 62). Two main measures of oral sensitivity were performed: to assess bite force, subjects were asked to discriminate between foam samples of varying hardness. Secondly, to assess lingual sensitivity the subjects were asked to identify 3D printed shapes, ranging from 3mm to 8mm, using their tongue, as well as identify confectionary letters. Additionally, chewing efficiency was measured through assessing each participants ability to mix two-colored chewing gum. In general, we found that sensitivity and chewing efficiency in the younger age groups was superior to that of older adults (p<0.0001). We also found a positive linear trend between bite force sensitivity and chewing efficiency with younger participants, a trend not found in older participants. We found no significant relationship between age groups for bite force and chewing efficiency, suggesting that age-related declines in bite force sensitivity are not a significant cause of altered oral processing ability. These results help bolster evidence that sensitivity and oral processing are related, as well previously reported declines in both as people age.",

    "abstract": "Aims/hypothesisAging is associated with impaired insulin sensitivity and increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes. However, it remains unclear whether aging-related insulin resistance is due to age per se, or increased adiposity associated with advanced age. In the present study, we investigate the impact of aging on insulin sensitivity independent of changes in body composition.\\n\\nMethodsCohorts of C57BL/6J male mice at 4-8 months of age ( young) and 18-27 mo ( aged) exhibiting similar body composition were characterized with static (plasma glucose and insulin levels) and dynamic (glucose and insulin tolerance tests) measures of glucose metabolism on chow and high-fat diets. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp analysis. The relationship between aging and insulin resistance in humans was investigated in 1,250 non-diabetic Mexican-American individuals who underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps.\\n\\nResultsIn mice with similar body composition, age had no detrimental effect on plasma glucose and insulin levels. However, aged mice demonstrated mildly, but reproducibly, improved glucose tolerance on both chow and high-fat diets due to increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Moreover, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps revealed impaired insulin sensitivity and reduced insulin clearance in aged mice on both diets. Consistent with results in the mouse, age remained an independent determinant of insulin resistance after adjustment for body composition in Mexican-Americn males. Advanced age was also associated with diminished insulin clearance, but this effect was dependent on increased BMI.\\n\\nConclusions/interpretationThis study demonstrates for the first time that aging per se impairs insulin sensitivity independent of adiposity in mice and humans. These results raise the possibility that the pathogenetic mechanisms of age-related and obesity-associated insulin resistance are distinct.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

We have used association analyses of Brassica napus (oilseed rape/canola) accessions to identify variation in the expression of a HECT E3 ligase gene, BnaUPL3.C03, that influences seed size and final yield. We establish a mechanism in which UPL3 mediates the proteasomal degradation of LEC2, a master regulator of seed maturation. Reduced UPL3 expression increases LEC2 protein levels and prolongs expression of lipid biosynthetic genes and seed maturation.

Ancestral sequence reconstruction allows access to proteins across evolutionary time, and new methods such as pulsed-labeling hydrogen exchange coupled with mass spectrometry allow determination of folding intermediate structures at near amino-acid resolution. Here, we combine these techniques to monitor the folding of the ribonuclease H family along the evolutionary lineages of T. thermophilus and E. coli RNase H. All homologs and ancestral proteins studied populate a similar folding intermediate despite being separated by billions of years of evolution. Even though this conformation is conserved, the pathway leading to it has diverged over evolutionary time, and rational mutations can alter this trajectory. Our results demonstrate that evolutionary processes can affect the energy landscape to preserve or alter specific features of a proteins folding pathway.",

However, in many cancers, epigenomic analyses have been limited, and computational methods to infer regulatory networks in tumors typically use expression data alone, or rely on transcription factor (TF) motifs in annotated promoter regions. Here, we develop a novel machine learning strategy called PSIONIC (patient-specific inference of networks informed by chromatin) to combine cell line chromatin accessibility data with large tumor expression data sets and model the effect of enhancers on transcriptional programs in multiple cancers. We generated a new ATAC-seq data set profiling chromatin accessibility in gynecologic and basal breast cancer cell lines and applied PSIONIC to 723 RNA-seq experiments from ovarian, uterine, and basal breast tumors as well as 96 cell line RNA-seq profiles. Our computational framework enables us to share information across tumors to learn patient-specific inferred TF activities, revealing regulatory differences between and within tumor types. Many of the identified TF regulators were significantly associated with survival outcome in basal breast, uterine serous and endometrioid carcinomas. Moreover, PSIONIC-predicted activity for MTF1 in cell line models correlated with sensitivity to MTF1 inhibition. Therefore computationally dissecting the role of TFs in gynecologic cancers may ultimately advance personalized therapy.",

    "abstract": "Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) cause chronic, persistent infections in populations of domestic sheep and goats throughout the world. In this study, we use genomic data to investigate the origins and history of the SRLV pandemic. To explore the hypothesis that SRLV infection disseminated during Neolithic times, we performed a serology and DNA sequencing-based investigation of SRLVs diversity in the Fertile Crescent region, where domestication of sheep and goats is thought to have originally occurred. While we found an elevated level of viral genetic diversity compared to other regions of the world, we did not find unambiguous evidence that the Fertile Crescent region was the centre of the contemporary SRLV pandemic. We therefore examined historical reports to investigate the relationship between contemporary SRLV distribution and diversity and the emergence of SRLV-associated disease. Historical data suggested that the emergence of SRLV-associated disease might be associated with the long-distance export of exotic small ruminant breeds - in particular, karakul sheep from Central Asia - during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Phylogeographic analysis could neither confirm nor refute this hypothesis. However, we anticipate that future accumulation of genomic data from SRLV strains found throughout the world may allow for a more definitive assessment. The openly available data and resources assembled in this study will facilitate future investigations in this area.\\n\\nImportanceViruses that cause chronic, persistent infections have circulated in animals for millions of years. However, many have only emerged as pathogens within the far shorter timeframe of recorded human history. It is important to understand the history of chronic viral infections in domestic animals, so that more effective control and eradication programs can be developed.",

    "abstract": "Higher systematics within the Digenea, Carus 1863 have been relatively stable since a phylogenetic analysis of partial nuclear ribosomal markers (rDNA) led to the erection of the Diplostomida Olson, Cribb, Tkach, Bray, and Littlewood, 2003. However, recent mitochondrial (mt) genome phylogenies suggest this order might be paraphyletic. These analyses show members of two diplostomidan superfamilies are more closely related to the Plagiorchiida La Rue, 1957 than to other members of the Diplostomida. In one of the groups implicated, the Diplostomoidea Poirier, 1886, a recent phylogeny based on mt DNA also indicates the superfamily as a whole is non-monophyletic. To determine if these results were robust to additional taxon sampling, we analyzed mt genomes from seven diplostomoids in three families. To choose between phylogenetic alternatives based on mt genomes and the prior rDNA-based topology, we also analyzed hundreds of ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) assembled from shotgun sequencing. The Diplostomida was paraphyletic in the mt genome phylogeny, but supported in the UCE phylogeny. We speculate this mitonuclear discordance is related to ancient, rapid radiation in the Digenea. Both UCEs and mt genomes support the monophyly of the Diplostomoidea and show congruent relationships within it. The Cyathocotylidae Muhling, 1898 are early diverging descendants of a paraphyletic clade of Diplostomidae Poirier, 1886, in which were nested members of the Strigeidae Railliet, 1919; the results support prior suggestions that the Crassiphialinae Sudarikov, 1960 will rise to the family level. Morphological traits of diplostomoid metacercariae appear to be more useful for differentiating higher taxa than those of adults. We describe a new species of Cotylurus Szidat, 1928, resurrect a species of Hysteromorpha Lutz, 1931, and find support for a species of Alaria Schrank, 1788 of contested validity.

    "abstract": "In BriefWe describe a novel positioning system that utilizes the cyanobacterial nucleoid to segregate, transport and equidistantly position the carbon-fixation machinery (carboxysomes).\\n\\nSummaryCarboxysomes are protein-based bacterial organelles that encapsulate a key enzyme of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Previous work has implicated a ParA-like protein (hereafter McdA) as important for spatially organizing carboxysomes along the longitudinal axis of the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. Yet, how self-organization of McdA emerges and contributes to carboxysome positioning is unknown. Here, we show that a small protein, termed McdB, localizes to carboxysomes through interactions with carboxysome shell proteins to drive emergent oscillatory patterning of McdA on the nucleoid. Our results demonstrate that McdB directly interacts to stimulate McdA ATPase activity, and indicate that carboxysome-dependent McdA depletion zone formation on the nucleoid is required for directed motion of carboxysomes towards increased concentrations of McdA. We propose that McdA and McdB are a new class of self-organizing proteins that follow a Brownian-ratchet mechanism, challenging the cytoskeletal model of organelle transport, for equidistant positioning of carboxysomes in cyanobacteria. These results have broader implications for understanding spatial organization of protein mega-complexes and organelles in bacteria more broadly.",

    "abstract": "Algal blooms in lakes are often associated with anthropogenic eutrophication; however, they can occur naturally. In Spring of 2016 Mono Lake, a hyperalkaline lake in California, was near the height of a rare bloom of the algae Picocystis strain ML and at the apex of a multi-year long drought. These conditions presented a unique sampling opportunity to investigate microbiological dynamics during an intense natural bloom. We conducted a comprehensive molecular analysis along a depth transect near the center of the lake from surface to 25 m depth during June 2016. Across sampled depths, rRNA gene sequencing revealed that Picocystis associated chloroplast were found at 40-50 % relative abundance, greater than values recorded previously. Despite the presence of the photosynthetic oxygenic algal genus Picocystis, oxygen declined below detectible limits below 15 m depth, corresponding with an increase in microorganisms known to be anaerobic. In contrast to previously sampled years, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data suggested a loss of sulfate reducing microorganisms throughout the lakes water column. Gene transcripts associated with Photosystem I and II were expressed at both 2 m and 25 m, suggesting that limited oxygen production may occur at extremely low light levels at depth within the lake. Oxygenic photosynthesis under low light conditions, in the absence of potential grazing by the brine shrimp Artemia, may allow for a cryptic redox cycle to occur in an otherwise anoxic setting at depth in the lake with the following effects: enhanced productivity, reduced grazing pressure on Picocystis, and an exacerbation of bloom.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEMono Lake, California provides habitat to a unique ecological community that is heavily stressed due to recent human water diversions and a period of extended drought. To date, no baseline information exists about Mono Lake to understand how the microbial community responds to drought, bloom, and what genetic functions are lost in the water column. While previously identified anaerobic members of the microbial community disappear from the water column during drought and bloom, sediment samples suggest these microorganisms seek refuge at lake bottom or in the subsurface. Thus, the sediments may represent a type of seed bank which could restore the microbial community as a bloom subsides. Our work also sheds light on the activity of the halotolerant algae Picocystis strain ML during a bloom at Mono Lake, its ability to potentially produce oxygen via photosynthesis even under extreme low-light conditions, and how the remainder of the microbial community responds.",

In Dictyostelium discoideum, recruitment of the ESCRT-III protein Snf7/Chmp4/Vps32 and the ATPase Vps4 to sites of membrane repair relies on the ESCRT-I component Tsg101 and occurs in absence of Ca2+. The ESX-1 dependent membrane perforations produced by the pathogen Mycobacterium marinum separately engage both ESCRT and autophagy. In absence of Tsg101, M. marinum escapes earlier to the cytosol, where it is restricted by xenophagy.

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to determine the timing of Leptospira dissemination after infection using natural physiologic routes and its correlation with signs and symptoms of leptospirosis. Groups of C3H-HeJ mice were sub-lethally infected through exposure of a dermis wound and the oral mucosa to L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni, and compared to mice infected via standard laboratory practice of intraperitoneal inoculation. We found that transdermal infection leads to delayed bacterial dissemination in blood and urine when compared to intraperitoneal infection using the same infectious dose, and that the overlapping presence of L. interrogans in both fluids was twice as long as the standard intraperitoneal infection. Furthermore, dissemination of L. interrogans and disease did not occur in mice infected with the same dose of L. interrogans via the oral mucosa. Over the course of these studies we also observed that the timing of exit of Leptospira from blood and establishment of colonization of the kidney in the second week of infection correlated well with weight loss, but not with hypothermia. Thus, a non-invasive sign of leptospirosis such as weigh loss can be used to monitor bacterial dissemination and disease stage in mice. Our findings underline the importance of precise determination of windows of pathogen dissemination in biological fluids and how the route of infection affects the progression of disease. These studies could help focus the development of better treatment strategies and new technologies for diagnostic use.",

    "abstract": "Retroviral protease inhibitors (RPIs) such as lopinavir (LP) and saquinavir (SQ) are active against Plasmodium parasites. However, the exact molecular target(s) for these RPIs in the Plasmodium parasites remains poorly understood. We hypothesised that LP and SQ suppress parasite growth through inhibition of aspartyl proteases. Using reverse genetics approach, we embarked on separately generating knockout (KO) parasite lines lacking Plasmepsin 4 (PM4), PM7, PM8, or DNA damage-inducible protein 1 (Ddi1) in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei ANKA. We then tested the suppressive profiles of the LP/Ritonavir (LP/RT) and SQ/RT as well as antimalarials; Amodiaquine (AQ) and Piperaquine (PQ) against the KO parasites in the standard 4-day suppressive test. The Ddi1 gene proved refractory to deletion suggesting that the gene is essential for the growth of the asexual blood stage parasites. Our results revealed that deletion of PM4 significantly reduces normal parasite growth rate phenotype (P = 0.003). Unlike PM4_KO parasites which were less susceptible to LP and SQ (P = 0.036, P = 0.030), the suppressive profiles for PM7_KO and PM8_KO parasites were comparable to those for the WT parasites. This finding suggests a potential role of PM4 in the LP and SQ action. On further analysis, modelling and molecular docking studies revealed that both LP and SQ displayed high binding affinities (-6.3 kcal/mol to -10.3 kcal/mol) towards the Plasmodium aspartyl proteases. We concluded that PM4 plays a vital role in assuring asexual stage parasite fitness and might be mediating LP and SQ action. The essential nature of the Ddi1 gene warrants further studies to evaluate its role in the parasite asexual blood stage growth as well as a possible target for the RPIs.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) such as LP or SQ that inhibit viral proteases reduce the rate of multiplication of the malaria parasites. The mode of action of these drugs against the parasites is however poorly understood. The proteases are among the enzymes that play essential roles in Plasmodium parasites. We sought to investigate the possible mode of action of these drugs by generating mutant parasites lacking specific aspartyl proteases namely PM4, PM7, PM8 or Ddi1 and then evaluate the susceptibility of the mutants to LP and SQ. We successfully generated parasites lacking either PM4, PM7 or PM8 but Ddi1 gene was refractory to deletion. From our data, we demonstrate that, unlike PM7 and PM8, the PM4 and Ddi1 are essential enzymes for asexual blood stage parasite fitness and survival and that the PM4 might be a target for the viral protease inhibitors in reducing parasite growth and multiplication. Further experiments using molecular docking tools show that LP or SQ have a high binding affinity for the Plasmodium aspartyl proteases.",

    "abstract": "RASSF6 is a member of the tumor suppressor Ras-association domain family (RASSF) proteins. RASSF6 is frequently suppressed in human cancers and its low expression is associated with poor prognosis. RASSF6 regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and plays a tumor suppressor role. Mechanistically, RASSF6 blocks MDM2-mediated p53 degradation and enhances p53 expression. However, RASSF6 also induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the p53-negative background, which implies that the tumor suppressor function of RASSF6 does not depend solely on p53. In this study, we have revealed that RASSF6 mediates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via pRb. RASSF6 enhances the interaction between pRb and protein phosphatase. RASSF6 also enhances P16INK4A and P14ARF expression through suppressing BMI1. In this way, RASSF6 increases unphosphorylated pRb and augments the interaction between pRb and E2F1. Moreover, RASSF6 induces TP73-target genes via pRb and E2F1 in the p53-negative background. Finally, we confirmed that RASSF6 depletion induces polypoid cells in p53-negative HCT116 cells. In conclusion, RASSF6 behaves as a tumor suppressor in cancers with the loss-of-function of p53, and pRb is implicated in this function of RASSF6.",

Both subcellular structures have adapted to facilitate the remarkable sensitivity and speed of hair cell mechanotransduction. While the mechanosensory hair bundle is extensively studied, the molecules and mechanisms mediating the development and function of the cuticular plate are poorly understood. The cuticular plate is believed to provide a rigid foundation for stereociliar pivot movements, but specifics about its function, especially the significance of its integrity for long-term maintenance of hair cell mechanotransduction, are not known. In this study, we describe the discovery of a hair cell protein called LIM only protein 7 (LMO7). In the hair cell, LMO7 is specifically localized in the cuticular plate. Lmo7 KO mice suffer multiple deficiencies in the cuticular plate, including reduced filamentous actin density and abnormal length and distribution of stereociliar rootlets. In addition to the cuticular plate defects, older Lmo7 KO mice develop abnormalities in inner hair cell stereocilia. Together, these defects affect cochlear tuning and sensitivity and give rise to late-onset progressive hearing loss.",

    "abstract": "Across-trial variability of EEG decreases more markedly prior to self-initiated than prior to externally-triggered actions, providing a novel neural precursor for volitional action. However, it remains unclear whether this neural convergence is an early, deliberative stage, or a late, execution-related stage in the chain of cognitive processes that transform intentions to actions. We report two experiments addressing these questions. Self-initiated actions were operationalized as endogenous  skip responses while waiting for target stimuli in a perceptual decision task. These self-initiated  skips were compared to blocks where participants were instructed to skip. EEG variability decreased more markedly prior to self-initiated compared to externally-triggered  skip actions, replicating previous findings.\\n\\nImportantly, this EEG convergence was stronger at fronto-midline electrodes than at either the electrode contralateral or ipsilateral to the hand assigned to the  skip action in each block (Experiment 1). Further, convergence was stronger when availability of skip responses was  rationed, encouraging deliberate planning before skipping (Experiment 2). This suggests that the initiation of voluntary actions involves a bilaterally-distributed, effector-independent process related to deliberation. A consistent process of volition is detectable during early, deliberative planning, and not only during late, execution-related time windows.",

    "abstract": "Barriers to regeneration in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) include the presence of inhibitory factors like myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) that block re-growth of injured axons. Inhibition by MAG antagonizes the induction of integrin-based substrate adhesions in axonal growth cones by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Here, using a novel approach to overcome inhibitory actions of MAG by activating integrins, we provide cellular and molecular evidence that integrin activity modulates the actions of chemotropic cues on substrate adhesions and supports axon regeneration in vertebrates. Potentiating integrin activity in cultured spinal neurons blocked negative integrin remodeling and inhibition of axon outgrowth induced by MAG, but also restored BDNF-dependent integrin clustering and stimulated outgrowth. In a zebrafish complete spinal cord transection model, combined integrin activation and BDNF treatment synergistically triggered functional regeneration of long projection axons that lack regenerative capacity from the hindbrain. The combined treatment also promoted functional repair even in the presence of exogenous mammalian inhibitory factors, including MAG, which alone impaired recovery of swimming movements. Thus, integrin activation state plays complementary roles in modulating the output activity of opposing cues on integrin-based adhesions and supports functional nerve regeneration in vivo. Our findings reveal effective reversal of downstream actions of inhibitory cues, thereby overcoming a major barrier to regeneration in the mammalian CNS, while simultaneously supporting neurotrophin-stimulated outgrowth. Discovery of therapeutic strategies targeting integrin activation state therefore holds promise for promoting axon regeneration after traumatic injury, which is a critical step in restoring connectivity and functional recovery.",

    "abstract": "Motor symptoms are defining traits in the diagnosis of Parkinsons disease (PD). A crucial component in motor function and control of movements is the integration of efferent signals from the motor network to the peripheral motor system, and afferent proprioceptive sensory feedback. Previous studies have indicated abnormal movement-related cortical oscillatory activity in PD, but the role of the proprioceptive afference on abnormal oscillatory activity in PD has not been elucidated. In the present study, we examine the role of proprioception by studying the cortical processing of proprioceptive stimulation in PD patients, ON/OFF levodopa medication, as compared to that of healthy controls (HC). We used a proprioceptive stimulator that generated precisely controlled passive movements of the index finger and measured the induced cortical oscillatory responses following the proprioceptive stimulation using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Both PD patients and HC showed a typical initial mu/beta-band (8-30 Hz) desynchronization during the passive movement. However, the subsequent beta rebound after the passive movement that was apparent in HC was much attenuated and almost absent in PD patients. Furthermore, we found no difference in the degree of beta rebound attenuation between patients ON and OFF levodopa medication. Our results hence demonstrate a disease-related deterioration in cortical processing of proprioceptive afference in PD, and further suggest that such disease-related loss of proprioceptive function is due to processes outside the dopaminergic system affected by levodopa medication.",

    "abstract": "Primate cortical evolution has been characterized by massive and disproportionate expansion of a set of specific regions in the neocortex. The associated increase in neocortical neurons comes with a high metabolic cost, thus the functions served by these regions must have conferred significant evolutionary advantage. Here, across a series of experiments, we show that the evolutionary high-expanding  hotspots - as estimated from patterns of evolutionary expansion from several primate species - share functional connections with different brain networks in a context-dependent manner. This capacity of the hotspots to connect flexibly with various specialized brain networks depending on particular cognitive requirements suggests that their selective growth and sustainment in evolution has been linked to their involvement in supramodal cognition. In accordance with an evolutionary-developmental view, we find that this ability to flexibly modulate functional connections as a function of cognitive state emerges gradually through childhood, with a prolonged developmental trajectory plateauing in young adulthood.",

We subcloned a channelrhodopsin variant and the yellow fluorescent protein Venus into a Semliki Forest virus vector and injected the virus into the optic lobe of locusts (Schistocerca americana). Fluorescence was observed in all injected optic lobes. Most neurons that expressed the recombinant proteins were located in the first two neuropils of the optic lobe, the lamina and medulla.

The optogenetic activation of the medullary neurons also triggered firing of a postsynaptic, looming-sensitive neuron, the Lobula Giant Movement Detector (LGMD).

    "abstract": "Dispersal is fundamental to population dynamics and it is increasingly apparent that, despite most models treating dispersal as a constant, many organisms make dispersal decisions based upon information gathered from the environment. Ideally, organisms would make fully informed decisions, with knowledge of both intra-patch conditions (conditions in their current location) and extra-patch conditions (conditions in alternative locations). Acquiring information is energetically costly however, and extra-patch information will typically be costlier to obtain than intra-patch information. As a consequence, theory suggests that organisms will often make partially informed dispersal decisions, utilising intra-patch information only. We test this proposition in an experimental two-patch system using populations of the aquatic crustacean, Daphnia carinata. We manipulated conditions (food availability) in the populations home patch, and in its alternative patch. We found that D. carinata made use of intra-patch information (resource limitation in the home patch induced a ten-fold increase in dispersal probability) but made no use of extra-patch information (resource limitation in the alternative patch did not affect dispersal probability). Our work highlights the very large influence that information can have on dispersal probability, but also that dispersal decisions will often be made in only a partially informed manner. The magnitude of the response we observed also adds to the growing chorus that condition-dependence may be a significant driver of variation in dispersal.",

    "abstract": "Treatment options for influenza B virus infections are limited to neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) which block the neuraminidase (NA) glycoprotein on the virion surface. The development of NAI resistance would therefore result in a loss of antiviral treatment options for influenza B infections. This study characterized two contemporary influenza B viruses with known resistance-conferring NA amino acid substitutions, D197N and H273Y, detected during routine surveillance. The D197N and H273Y variants were characterized in vitro by assessing NA enzyme activity and affinity, as well as replication in cell culture compared to NAI-sensitive wild-type viruses. In vivo studies were also performed in ferrets to assess the replication and transmissibility of each variant. Mathematical models were used to analyse within-host and between-host fitness of variants relative to wild-type viruses. The data revealed that the H273Y variant had similar NA enzyme function relative to its wild-type but had slightly reduced replication and transmission efficiency in vivo. The D197N variant had impaired NA enzyme function but there was no evidence of reduction in replication or transmission efficiency in ferrets. Our data suggest that the influenza B variant with H273Y NA substitution had a more notable reduction in fitness compared to wild-type viruses than the influenza B variant with the D197N NA substitution. Although a D197N variant is yet to become widespread, it is the most commonly detected NAI-resistant influenza B virus in surveillance studies. Our results highlight the need to carefully monitor circulating viruses for the spread of influenza B viruses with the D197N NA substitution.",

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryBacterial vaginosis is a common condition among women of reproductive age and is associated with potentially serious side-effects, including an increased risk of preterm birth. Recent advancements in microbiome sequencing technologies have produced novel insights into the complicated mechanisms underlying bacterial vaginosis and have given rise to new methods of diagnosis. Here we report on the validation of a quantitative, molecular diagnostic algorithm based on the relative abundances of ten potentially pathogenic bacteria and four commensal Lactobacillus species in research subjects (n = 172) classified as symptomatic (n = 149) or asymptomatic (n = 23). We observe a clear and reinforcing pattern among patients diagnosed by the algorithm that is consistent with the current understanding of biological dynamics and dysregulation of the vaginal microbiome during infection. Using this enhanced assessment of the underlying biology of infection, we demonstrate improved diagnostic sensitivity (93%) and specificity (90%) relative to current diagnostic tools. Our algorithm also appears to provide enhanced diagnostic capabilities in ambiguous classes of patients for whom diagnosis and medical decision-making is complicated, including asymptomatic patients and those deemed \\\"intermediate\\\" by Nugent scoring. Ultimately, we establish CLS2.0q as a quantitative, sensitive, specific, accurate, robust, and flexible algorithm for the clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis - importantly, one that is also ideal for the differential diagnosis of non-BV infections with clinically similar presentations.",

    "abstract": "Accurate, RNA-seq based, microRNA (miRNA) expression estimates from primary cells have recently been described. However, this in vitro data is mainly obtained from cell culture, which is known to alter cell maturity/differentiation status, significantly changing miRNA levels. What is needed is a robust method to obtain in vivo miRNA expression values directly from cells. We introduce expression microdissection miRNA small RNA sequencing (xMD-miRNA-seq), a method to isolate cells directly from formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. xMD-miRNA-seq is a low-cost, high-throughput, immunohistochemistry-based method to capture any cell type of interest. As a proof-of-concept, we isolated colon epithelial cells from two specimens and performed low-input small RNA-seq. We generated up to 600,000 miRNA reads from the samples. Isolated epithelial cells, had abundant epithelial-enriched miRNA expression (miR-192; miR-194; miR-200b; miR-200c; miR-215; miR-375) and overall similar miRNA expression patterns to other epithelial cell populations (colonic enteroids and flow-isolated colon epithelium). xMD-derived epithelial cells were generally not contaminated by other adjacent cells of the colon as noted by t-SNE analysis. xMD-miRNA-seq allows for simple, economical, and efficient identification of cell-specific miRNA expression estimates. Further development will enhance rapid identification of cell-specific miRNA expression estimates in health and disease for nearly any cell type using archival FFPE material.",

    "abstract": "Allostery is a fundamental principle of protein regulation that remains poorly understood and hard to engineer, in particular in ion channels. Here we use human Inward Rectifier K+ Channel Kir2.1 to establish domain insertion  permissibility as a new experimental paradigm to identify engineerable allosteric sites. We find that permissibility is best explained by dynamic protein properties, such as conformational flexibility. Many allosterically regulated sites in Kir2.1 or sites equivalent to those regulated in homologs, such as G-protein-gated inward rectifier K+ channels (GIRK), have differential permissibility; that is, for these sites permissibility depends on the structural properties of the inserted domain. Our data and the well-established link between protein dynamics and allostery led us to propose that differential permissibility is a metric of both existing and latent allostery in Kir2.1. In support of this notion, inserting light-switchable domains into either existing or latent allosteric sites, but not elsewhere, renders Kir2.1 activity sensitive to light.",

Given the advent of multi-region sampling, and the opportunities offered by them to understand tumour evolutionary history, we focus on a suite of statistical measures of the phylogenetic trees resulting from the tumours evolution in different regions of parameter space and through time. We find strikingly different patterns in these measures for changing symmetric division probability which hinge on the inclusion of spatial constraints.

    "abstract": "Rhinoviruses (RVs) occur more frequently than other viruses and more often in people displaying symptoms than in those without. RVs exacerbate chronic airway disease and confound the clinical diagnosis of influenza-like illness. We sought to estimate the spectrum of RV diversity, RV species seasonality and to breakdown RV involvement in respiratory virus co-detections by comprehensive molecular testing of a convenience collection of airway sample extracts from patients with suspected respiratory infections, collected during 2001.\\n\\nRVs were the most common virus detected. We were able to genotype [~]90% of RV detections, identifying 70 distinct RVs, spanning all three species. RV-Bs were under-represented. We found RV species co-circulated at times, although one species usually dominated. Each species displayed a bimodal distribution.\\n\\nNotably, RVs and influenza A viruses (IFAV) seldom co-occurred, supporting their roles as primary pathogens of the airway among acutely ill infants. Whether RV circulation has a moderating or controlling effect on the IFAV season or is controlled by it cannot be determined from these data.\\n\\nDespite the frequent perception that RVs commonly co-occur with another virus, our findings indicated this was not the case. Nearly 80% of RV detections occurred alone. Understanding more about population-level interference between viruses may allow us to harness aspects of it to generate a non-specific antiviral intervention that mimics a putative protective effect.\\n\\nFor routine respiratory virus screening to best serve the patient, RV testing should be a principal component of any acute respiratory illness testing algorithm throughout the year.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in cladistic technology have produced novel methods for introducing morphological data into cladistic analyses, such as the landmark and continuous character functions in the software TNT and RevBayes. While these new methods begin to address the problem of representing morphology, there has been little consideration of how to transform and code the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) dimensions into the datamatrix. Indeed, angles, serial counts, percentages and quotient values can be used as continuous characters, but little has been said about how coding these data affect the trees discovered. Logically, counts of elements and angles measured off specimens may be coded directly into continuous character matrices but percentages and quotient values are more problematic, being transformed data. Quotient values and percentages are the simplest way of representing proportional differences between two dimensions and reducing the effect of inter-taxonomic magnitude differences. However, both are demonstrated to be problematic transformations that produce continuous characters with weighted states that are non-representative of morphological variation. Thus, two OTUs may be represented as less/more similar morphologically than other OTUs that display the same degree of morphological variation. Furthermore, the researchers choice of which dimension is the divisor and dividend will have a similar affect. To address this problem, a trigonometric solution and a logarithmic solution have been proposed. Another solution called linear transposition scaling (LTS) was recently presented, with the intention of best representing and coding observable morphological variation. All three methods are reviewed to establish the best way to represent and code morphology in a cladistic analysis using continuous characters.",

We studied three stages of fermentation and obtained 448,916 reads. Using this approach, we revealed the presence of 30 phyla, 55 classes, 86 orders, 206 families and 695 genera of bacteria in the shrimp paste. Shrimp paste in fermentation metaphase had a more diverse microbiota than that in fermentation prophase and fermentation anaphase. Diversity appeared greatest in fermentation anaphase. The four dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. The most common genera were Psychrobacter, Halomonas, Bacillus, Alteribacillus, and Lactococcus. Their content varied at different stages of fermentation. All the microbiome presented a variety of changes in the microbial diversity of shrimp paste.\\n\\nImportanceMost research on the microbial diversity of shrimp paste has focused on the shrimp culture environment, or the chemical composition and sensory attributes of the paste. Little research has been conducted on the microbial diversity and composition of shrimp paste. The relationship between microbes and the flavor and quality of shrimp paste has thus been unknown. We therefore analyzed the microbial composition and variation of shrimp paste at different stages of fermentation. The dominant bacteria in fermentation prophase, metaphase, and anaphase were identified. Our preliminary findings give some insight into which microbes contribute to the flavor of shrimp paste and suggest how to improve its flavor. In addition, our findings are relevant to optimizing the production of shrimp paste and guaranteeing its quality and safety.",

Our method estimates interneuronal connections in units of postsynaptic potentials and the amount of spike recording needed for verifying connections. The performance of inference is optimized by counting the estimation errors using synthetic data from a network of Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons. By applying our method to rat hippocampal data, we show that the numbers and types of connections estimated from our calculations match the results inferred from other physiological cues.

This work aimed to evaluate the extent and decay of linkage disequilibrium in a coho salmon breeding population using ddRAD genomic markers.\\n\\nLinkage disequilibrium was estimated between a total of 7,505 SNPs found in 62 individuals (33 dams and 29 sires) from the breeding population. The makers encompass all 30 coho salmon chromosomes and comprise 1,655.19 Mb of the genome. The average density of markers per chromosome ranged from 3.45 to 6.11 per 1 Mbp. The minor allele frequency averaged 0.20 (with a range from 0.08 to 0.50). The overall average linkage disequilibrium among SNPs pairs measured as r2 was 0.054. The Average r2 value decreased with increasing physical distance, with values ranging from 0.37 to 0.054 at distances lower than 1 kb and up to 10 Mb, respectively. An r2 threshold of 0.1 was reached at distance of approximately 1.3 Mb. Chromosomes Okis05, Okis15 and Okis28 showed high levels of linkage disequilibrium (> 0.20 at distances lower than 1 Mb). Average r2 values were lower than 0.1 for all chromosomes at distances greater than 4 Mb. Linkage disequilibrium values suggest that whole genome association and selection studies could be performed using about 75,000 SNPs in aquaculture populations (depending on the trait under investigation). From the identified SNPs, an effective population size of 100 was estimated for the population 10 generation ago, and 1,000, for 139 generations ago.\\n\\nBased on the extent of r2 decay, we suggest that at least 75,000 SNPs would be necessary for an association mapping study. Over 100,000 SNPs would be necessary for a high power study, in the current coho salmon population.",

These experiments revealed that POT1a inactivation leads to a partially penetrant lethality, and surviving mice displayed ataxia due to loss of neuronal progenitor cells, and died by 3 weeks of age. Inactivation of p53 was sufficient to completely suppress the lethality associated with POT1a depletion and rescued the neuronal defects characterizing POT1a depleted animals. In contrast, activation of ATM by the depletion of the shelterin protein TRF2 resulted in a fully penetrant lethality that could not be rescued by p53 inactivation (Lobanova et al.). This data reveals that activation of distinct types of DNA damage response pathway give rise to different types of neuropathology.

There is a need for new, effective, and scalable treatments for depression, and cognitive bias modification (CBM) of negative emotional processing biases has been suggested as one possibility. Such treatments may form the basis of  digital therapeutics, that could be administered remotely and at low cost, should they prove to be effective.\\n\\nOBJECTIVESStudy one was designed to determine neural correlates of a recently developed CBM technique for emotion recognition training; specifically, our aim was to compare the effects of training vs placebo on pre-specified regions of interest involved in emotion processing that are known to be sensitive to antidepressant treatment. Study two aimed to investigate efficacy of training on mood measures at 2 and 6-week follow-up and was powered to replicate and extend earlier findings.\\n\\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSBoth studies were double blind RCTs, in which participants completed five sessions of emotion recognition training or sham training, in the laboratory, over a one-week period. In study one (N=37), following this training, participants completed a novel emotion recognition task whilst undergoing fMRI. In study two (N=190), measures of mood were assessed post training, and at 2-week and 6-week follow-up. Both studies recruited analogue samples of healthy volunteers with high levels of depressive symptoms (BDI-ii > 14).\\n\\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESIn study one, our primary outcome was neural activation in the following pre-specified regions of interest: the bilateral amygdala, the mPFC, bilateral dlPFC, and the occipital cortex. In study two, our primary outcome was depressive symptoms over the last 2 weeks assessed using the BDI-ii at 6-week follow-up. Secondary outcomes included depressive symptoms measured using the HAM-D, and positive and negative affect assessed using the PANAS.\\n\\nRESULTSIn both studies, CBM resulted in a change in emotion recognition bias, which (in study two) persisted for 6 weeks after the end of the CBM phase. In study one, CBM resulted in increases neural activation to happy faces compared to sad faces, with this effect driven by an increase in neural activity for happy faces. We saw this increase in activation for this contrast at both the whole brain level and among our a priori ROIs, specifically the mPFC and bilateral amygdala. In study two, CBM did not lead to a reduction in depressive symptoms on the BDI-ii, or on related measures of mood, motivation and persistence, or depressive interpretation bias.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCECBM of emotion recognition appears to have effects on neural activity that are similar in some respects to those induced by SSRI administration (study one), but we find no evidence that this has any effect on self-reported mood in an analogue sample of healthy volunteers with low mood (study two).",

    "abstract": "Unlike inorganic or other synthetic alternatives, ice nucleating proteins (INPs) remain the most efficient ice nuclei today. Their potential applications in cryo-preservation, biomedicine, food industry and in the modulation of climate are widespread. Nevertheless, over several decades, cell-based recombinant methods have experienced multiple difficulties expressing these large proteins in full-length and in necessary yields while retaining functionality. As a result, our understanding of the structure and ice nucleation mechanism for this class of proteins is incomplete, and, most importantly, the full extent of possible applications unrealized. Using a wheat-germ cell-free expression pipeline, we successfully expressed and purified full-length ice nucleating protein InaZ from Pseudomonas syringae, known as a model INP. High protein yield and solubility has been achieved using this system. Ice nucleation experiments inside a dynamic environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) confirmed that the produced InaZ products remain functional. Preliminary structural assessments of these proteins using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) showed experimental evidence for their structural organization as fibrils. We believe that the current platform will be suitable for expressing other INPs of interest and can be further employed as new engineering system either for industrial or scientific needs.",

    "abstract": "Within the economically important plant family Solanaceae, Jaltomata is a rapidly evolving genus that has extensive diversity in flower size and shape, as well as fruit and nectar color, among its [~]80 species. Here we report the whole-genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation, of one representative species (Jaltomata sinuosa) from this genus. Combining PacBio long-reads (25X) and Illumina short-reads (148X) achieved an assembly of approximately 1.45 Gb, spanning [~]96% of the estimated genome. 96% of curated single-copy orthologs in plants were detected in the assembly, supporting a high level of completeness of the genome. Similar to other Solanaceous species, repetitive elements made up a large fraction ([~]80%) of the genome, with the most recently active element, Gypsy, expanding across the genome in the last 1-2 million years.\\n\\nComputational gene prediction, in conjunction with a merged transcriptome dataset from 11 tissues, identified 34725 protein-coding genes. Comparative phylogenetic analyses with six other sequenced Solanaceae species determined that Jaltomata is most likely sister to Solanum, although a large fraction of gene trees supported a conflicting bipartition consistent with substantial introgression between Jaltomata and Capsicum after these species split. We also identified gene family dynamics specific to Jaltomata, including expansion of gene families potentially involved in novel reproductive trait development, and loss of gene families that accompanied the loss of self-incompatibility. This high-quality genome will facilitate studies of phenotypic diversification in this rapidly radiating group, and provide a new point of comparison for broader analyses of genomic evolution across the Solanaceae.",

    "abstract": "Insect specific viruses (ISVs) of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti have been demonstrated to modulate transmission of arboviruses such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus by the mosquito. The diversity and composition of the virome of Ae. aegypti, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, we characterised Aedes anphevirus (AeAV), a negative-sense RNA virus from the order Mononegavirales. AeAV identified from Aedes cell lines were infectious to both Ae. aegypti and Aedes albopictus cells, but not to three mammalian cell lines. To understand the incidence and genetic diversity of AeAV, we assembled 17 coding-complete and two partial genomes of AeAV from available RNA-Seq data. AeAV appears to transmit vertically and be present in laboratory colonies, wild-caught mosquitoes and cell lines worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis of AeAV strains indicates that as the Ae. aegypti mosquito has expanded into the Americas and Asia-Pacific, AeAV has evolved into monophyletic African, American and Asia-Pacific lineages. The endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis restricts positive-sense RNA viruses in Ae. aegypti. Re-analysis of a small RNA library of Ae. aegypti cells co-infected with AeAV and Wolbachia produces an abundant RNAi response consistent with persistent virus replication. We found Wolbachia enhances replication of AeAV when compared to a tetracycline cleared cell line, and AeAV modestly reduces DENV replication in vitro. The results from our study improve understanding of the diversity and evolution of the virome of Ae. aegypti and adds to previous evidence that shows Wolbachia does not restrict a range of negative strand RNA viruses.",

    "abstract": "ResumePhylogenetic analyses separate candidate phyla radiation (CPR) bacteria from other bacteria, but the degree to which their proteomes are distinct remains unclear. Here, we leveraged a proteome database that includes sequences from thousands of uncultivated organisms to identify protein families and examine their organismal distributions. We focused on widely distributed protein families that co-occur in genomes, as they likely foundational for metabolism. Clustering of genomes using the protein family presence/absence patterns broadly recapitulates the phylogenetic structure of the tree, suggesting persistence of core sets of protein families after lineage divergence. CPR bacteria group together and away from all other bacteria and archaea, in part due to novel proteins, some of which may be involved in cell-cell interactions. The diversity of combinations of protein families in CPR may exceed that of all other bacteria. Overall, the results extend the phylogeny-based suggestion that the CPR represent a major subdivision within Bacteria.",

    "abstract": "A Klebsiella strain, WCHKl090001, was recovered from a human urine sample in China in 2017. Phylogenetic analysis based on gyrA and rpoB housekeeping genes revealed that the strain was distinct from any previously described species of the genus Klebsiella though it was clustered with the Klebsiella oxytoca phylogroup including Klebsiella grimontii, Klebsiella michiganensis, and Klebsiella oxytoca. The whole genome sequence of strain WCHKl090001 has an up to 87.18% average nucleotide identity with those of type strains of all known Klebsiella species. In silico DNA-DNA hybridization (isDDH) values between strain WCHKl090001 and type strains of all known Klebsiella species range from 22.3 to 35.2%. Strain WCHKl090001 could be distinguished from species of the Klebsiella oxytoca phylogroup by its negative Voges-Proskauer reaction. Genotypic and phenotypic characteristics from this study indicate that strain WCHKl090001 should be considered to represent a novel species of the genus Klebsiella, for which the name Klebsiella huaxiensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WCHKl090001T (=GDMCC1.1379T = CCTCC AB 2018106 T).",

    "abstract": "A lot of hype has recently been generated around deep learning, a group of artificial intelligence approaches able to break accuracy records in pattern recognition. Over the course of just a few years, deep learning revolutionized several research fields such as bioinformatics or medicine. Yet such a surge of tools and knowledge is still in its infancy in ecology despite the ever-growing size and the complexity of ecological datasets. Here we performed a literature review of deep learning implementations in ecology to identify its benefits in most ecological disciplines, even in applied ecology, up to decision makers and conservationists alike. We also provide guidelines on useful resources and recommendations for ecologists to start adding deep learning to their toolkit. At a time when automatic monitoring of populations and ecosystems generates a vast amount of data that cannot be processed by humans anymore, deep learning could become a necessity in ecology.",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic interspecific interactions, including Mullerian mimicry and division of labor, are common in nature. In contrast to antagonistic interactions, where faster evolution is favored, mutualism can favor slower evolution under some conditions. This is called the Red King effect. After Bergstrom and Lachmann (2003) proposed Red King effect, it has been investigated in two species models. However, biological examples suggest that the mutualisms can include three or more species. Here, I modeled the evolutionary dynamics of mutualism in communities where there exist two or more species, and all species mutually interact with one another. Regardless of the number of species in the community, it is possible to derive conditions for the stable equilibria. Although there exist nonlinear relationship between the evolutionary rates and the evolutionary fate of each species in the multi-species communities, the model suggests that it is possible to predict whether the faster evolution is favored or disfavored for the relatively fast species; on the other hand, it is difficult to predict the evolutionary fate of relatively slow species because the evolutionary dynamics of the slow species is affected by the evolutionary fate of the fast species.",

    "abstract": "Calcium imaging has revolutionized systems neuroscience, providing the ability to image large neural populations with single-cell resolution. The resulting datasets are quite large (with scales of TB/hour in some cases), which has presented a barrier to routine open sharing of this data, slowing progress in reproducible research. State of the art methods for analyzing this data are based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF); these approaches solve a non-convex optimization problem, and are highly effective when good initializations are available, but can break down e.g. in low-SNR settings where common initialization approaches fail.\\n\\nHere we introduce an improved approach to compressing and denoising functional imaging data. The method is based on a spatially-localized penalized matrix decomposition (PMD) of the data to separate (low-dimensional) signal from (temporally-uncorrelated) noise. This approach can be applied in parallel on local spatial patches and is therefore highly scalable, does not impose non-negativity constraints or require stringent identifiability assumptions (leading to significantly more robust results compared to NMF), and estimates all parameters directly from the data, so no hand-tuning is required. We have applied the method to a wide range of functional imaging data (including one-photon, two-photon, three-photon, widefield, somatic, axonal, dendritic, calcium, and voltage imaging datasets): in all cases, we observe ~2-4x increases in SNR and compression rates of 20-300x with minimal visible loss of signal, with no adjustment of hyperparameters; this in turn facilitates the process of demixing the observed activity into contributions from individual neurons. We focus on two challenging applications: dendritic calcium imaging data and voltage imaging data in the context of optogenetic stimulation. In both cases, we show that our new approach leads to faster and much more robust extraction of activity from the video data.",
