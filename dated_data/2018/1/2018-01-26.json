    "abstract": "Determining the host-parasitoid interactions and parasitism rates for invasive species entering novel environments is an important first step in assessing potential routes for biocontrol and integrated pest management. Conventional insect rearing techniques followed by taxonomic identification are widely used to obtain such data, but this can be time consuming and prone to biases. Here we present a Next Generation Sequencing approach for use in ecological studies which allows for individual level metadata tracking of large numbers of invertebrate samples through the use of hierarchically organised molecular identification tags. We demonstrate its utility using a sample data set examining both species identity and levels of parasitism in late larval stages of the Oak Processionary Moth (Thaumetopoea processionea - Linn. 1758), an invasive species recently established in the UK. Overall we find that there are two main species exploiting the late larval stages of Oak Processionary Moth in the UK with the main parasitoid (Carcelia iliaca-Ratzeburg, 1840) parasitising 45.7% of caterpillars, while a rare secondary parasitoid (Compsilura conccinata-Meigen, 1824) was also detected in 0.4% of caterpillars. Using this approach on all life stages of the Oak Processionary Moth may demonstrate additional parasitoid diversity. We discuss the wider potential of nested tagging DNA-metabarcoding for constructing large, highly-resolved species interaction networks.",

    "abstract": "Disease tolerance is a defense strategy against infections that aims at maintaining host health even at high pathogen replication or load. Tolerance mechanisms are currently intensively studied with the long-term goal of exploiting them therapeutically. Because tolerance-based treatment imposes less selective pressure on the pathogen it has been hypothesised to be \\\"evolution-proof\\\". However, the primary public health goal is to reduce the incidence and mortality associated with a disease. From this perspective, tolerance-based treatment bears the risk of increasing the prevalence of the disease, which may lead to increased mortality. We assessed the promise of tolerance-based treatment strategies using mathematical models. Conventional treatment was implemented as an increased recovery rate, while tolerance-based treatment was assumed to reduce the disease-related mortality of infected hosts without affecting recovery. We investigated the endemic phase of two types of infections: acute and chronic. Additionally, we considered the effect of pathogen resistance against conventional treatment. We show that, for low coverage of tolerance-based treatment, chronic infections can cause even more deaths than without treatment. Overall, we found that conventional treatment always outperforms tolerance-based treatment, even when we allow the emergence of pathogen resistance. Our results cast doubt on the potential benefit of tolerance-based over conventional treatment. Any clinical application of tolerance-based treatment of infectious diseases has to consider the associated detrimental epidemiological feedback.\\n\\nAuthor summaryConventional therapies improve patient health by eliminating the pathogen, or, at least, reducing its burden. Recently, alternative therapies that exploit host tolerance mechanisms have received attention from the medical community as a promising strategy. These treatments aim at reducing the level of illness due to the infection, rather than eliminating the pathogen directly. Using a mathematical model, we show that although these treatments are beneficial at the individual level, they can have undesired public health consequences. In particular we show that tolerance-based treatment gives more time for the disease to spread in the population, which in turn increase its prevalence. Moreover, in the case of a low coverage of the treatment of a chronic infection, the overall mortality can increase.",

    "abstract": "Here we report the findings from the first two years of an arbovirus surveillance study conducted in Machala, Ecuador, a dengue endemic region (2014-2015). Patients with suspected dengue virus (DENV) infections (index cases, n=324) were referred from five Ministry of Health clinical sites. A subset of DENV positive index cases (n = 44) were selected, and individuals from the index household and four neighboring homes within 200-meters were recruited (n = 400). Individuals who entered the study, other than index cases, are referred to as associates. In 2014, 70.9% of index cases and 35.6% of associates had acute or recent DENV infections. In 2015, 28.3% of index cases and 12.8% of associates had acute or recent DENV infections. For every DENV infection captured by passive surveillance, we detected an additional three acute or recent DENV infections in associates. Of associates with acute DENV infections, 68% reported dengue-like symptoms, with the highest prevalence of symptomatic acute infections in children under 10 years of age. The first chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infections were detected on epidemiological week 12 in 2015. 43.1% of index cases and 3.5% of associates had acute CHIKV infections. No Zika virus infections were detected. Phylogenetic analyses of isolates of DENV from 2014 revealed genetic relatedness and shared ancestry of DENV1, DENV2 and DENV4 genomes from Ecuador with those from Venezuela and Colombia, indicating presence of viral flow between Ecuador and surrounding countries. Enhanced surveillance studies, such as this, provide high-resolution data on symptomatic and inapparent infections across the population.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPatients with brain lesions provide a unique opportunity to understand the functioning of the human mind. However, even when focal, brain lesions have local and remote effects that impact functionally and structurally connected circuits. Similarly, function emerges from the interaction between brain areas rather than their sole activity. For instance, category fluency requires the association between executive, semantic and language production functions.\\n\\nFindingsHere we provide, for the first time, a set of complementary solutions to measure the impact of a given lesion upon the neuronal circuits. Our methods, which were applied to 37 patients with a focal frontal brain lesion, revealed a large set of directly and indirectly disconnected brain regions that had significantly impacted category fluency performance. The directly disconnected regions corresponded to areas that are classically considered as functionally engaged in verbal fluency and categorization tasks. These regions were also organized into larger directly and indirectly disconnected functional networks, including the left ventral fronto-parietal network, whose cortical thickness correlated with performance on category fluency.\\n\\nConclusionsThe combination of structural and functional connectivity together with cortical thickness estimates reveals the remote effects of brain lesions, provide for the identification of the affected networks and strengthen our understanding of their relationship with cognitive and behavioural measures.

Here, we introduce a live-cell reporter for the pluripotency factor OCT4 into human embryonic stem cells to understand how they choose between self-renewal and differentiation. By tracing the histories of individual cells over multiple generations, we found that cells whose offspring were destined to differentiate showed decreased expression of OCT4 long before exposure to the differentiation stimulus. OCT4 levels were lineage-dependent; however, during cell division, mother cells distributed OCT4 asymmetrically to daughters. The resulting ratio of OCT4 between sister cells--established within minutes of mitosis--was predictive of downstream fates: cells receiving a greater ratio of maternal OCT4 showed sustained OCT4 levels and a reduced capacity to differentiate. Our observations imply that the choice between two developmental fates is almost entirely predetermined at the time of cell birth through inheritance of a pluripotency factor.",

    "abstract": "Diatoms contribute roughly 20% of global primary production, but the factors determining their ability to adapt to global warming are unknown. Here we quantify the capacity for adaptation to warming in the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. We found that evolutionary rescue under severe warming was slow but adaptation to more realistic scenarios, where temperature increases were moderate or where they fluctuated between benign and severe conditions, was rapid. Adaption to warming was linked to major phenotypic changes in metabolism and elemental composition. Whole genome re-sequencing identified significant genetic divergence both among populations adapted to the different warming regimes and between the evolved and ancestral lineages. Consistent with the phenotypic changes, the most rapidly evolving genes were associated with transcriptional regulation, cellular response to oxidative stress and redox homeostasis. These results demonstrate that evolution of thermal tolerance in marine diatoms can be rapid, particularly in fluctuating environments, and is underpinned by major genomic and phenotypic divergence.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disorder with a poor prognosis. Deleterious variation within components of the transforming growth factor-{beta} pathway, particularly the bone morphogenetic protein type 2 receptor (BMPR2), underlie most heritable forms of PAH. Since the missing heritability likely involves genetic variation confined to small numbers of cases, we performed whole genome sequencing in 1038 PAH index cases and 6385 PAH-negative control subjects. Case-control analyses revealed significant overrepresentation of rare variants in novel genes, namely ATP13A3, AQP1 and SOX17, and provided independent validation of a critical role for GDF2 in PAH. We provide evidence for familial segregation of mutations in SOX17 and AQP1 with PAH. Mutations in GDF2, encoding a BMPR2 ligand, led to reduced secretion from transfected cells. In addition, we identified pathogenic mutations in the majority of previously reported PAH genes, and provide evidence for further putative genes. Taken together these findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of PAH and indicate unexplored pathways for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that nonapoptotic caspase activity influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple in vivo caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathological models.\n\nSignificance StatementCaspase-3 is an enzyme that can cause cell death when highly active but can also perform important cellular functions, such as maturation and structural changes, when only weakly or transiently active. Despite the importance of this nonlethal type of caspase activity, there is no straightforward method to measure it in live rodents. We therefore developed mice that have a fluorescent reporter that is sensitive enough to detect nonlethal caspase activity. Surprisingly, we found that weak caspase activity influences the synchrony of neuronal firing across different brain regions. We also observed increased caspase activity in female mice after severe stress. This simple caspase activity reporter can subserve multiple applications in behavior and pathology research.",

Here we show that Eph receptor signaling from cell-cell contacts changes the cellular response to EGFR activation by altering its vesicular trafficking. Eph receptor activation traps EGFR in Rab5-positive early endosomes through an inhibition of Akt-dependent vesicular recycling. By altering the spatial distribution of EGFR activity during EGF stimulation, Eph receptor activation selectively suppresses migratory Akt signaling from the plasma membrane, while preserving proliferative ERK signaling from endosomes. We also show that soluble extracellular signals engaging the G-protein coupled receptor Kiss1 similarly suppress vesicular recycling to alter EGFR signaling. The cellular environment can thus modulate EGFR vesicular trafficking dynamics to generate context-dependent responses to EGF stimulation.\\n\\nSummaryEph receptor activation generates context-dependent cellular responses to EGFR activation by altering its vesicular trafficking dynamics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPhysical linkage among genes shaped by different sources of selection is a fundamental aspect of genetic architecture. Theory predicts that evolution in complex environments selects for modular genetic architectures and high recombination rates among loci shaped by different sources of selection. However, limited data exist to test these predictions because the field lacks consensus for how to control for intercorrelated environmental variables. Here, we introduce a co-association network analysis, which clusters loci based on differing environmental associations, and use it to study the genetic architecture of local adaptation to climate in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta).\\n\\nResultsWe identified many modules of genes associated with distinct environments (aridity, freezing, geography), and discovered low recombination rates among some candidate genes in different modules. We observed limited evidence for environmental pleiotropic effects on distinct aspects of climate. We also found limited correspondence between the modularity of co-association networks and gene regulatory networks. We compared co-association networks to associations with principal components, and found the latter can lead to misinterpretation. Finally, we used simulations to illustrate the benefits and caveats of co-association networks.\\n\\nConclusionsCo-association networks provided a useful framework for studying modularity. Our results supported the prediction that evolution to complex environments selects for modular genetic architectures, but some of our results went against the prediction that selection would increase recombination among loci experiencing different sources of selection. These results give new insight into evolutionary debates about the extent of modularity and pleiotropy in the evolution of genetic architectures.",

    "abstract": "Human brain mapping relies heavily on fMRI, ECoG and EEG, which capture different physiological signals. Relationships between these signals have been established in the context of specific tasks or during resting state, often using spatially confined concurrent recordings in animals. But it is not certain whether these correlations generalize to other contexts relevant for human cognitive neuroscience. Here, we address the case of complex naturalistic stimuli and ask two basic questions. First, how reliable are the responses evoked by a naturalistic audio-visual stimulus in each of these imaging methods, and second, how similar are stimulus-related responses across methods? To this end, we investigated a wide range of brain regions and frequency bands. We presented the same movie clip twice to three different cohorts of subjects (NEEG = 45, NfMRI = 11, NECoG = 5) and assessed stimulus-driven correlations across viewings and between imaging methods, thereby ruling out task-irrelevant confounds. All three imaging methods had similar repeat-reliability across viewings when fMRI and EEG data were averaged across subjects, highlighting the potential to achieve large signal-to-noise ratio by leveraging large sample sizes. The fMRI signal correlated positively with high-frequency ECoG power across multiple task-related cortical structures but positively with low-frequency EEG and ECoG power. In contrast to previous studies, these correlations were as strong for low-frequency as for high frequency ECoG. We also observed links between fMRI and infra-slow EEG voltage fluctuations. These results extend previous findings to the case of natural stimulus processing.",

    "abstract": "Variation in gut microbiome is associated with wellness and disease in humans, yet the molecular mechanisms by which this variation affects the host are not well understood. A likely mechanism is through changing gene regulation in interfacing host epithelial cells. Here, we treated colonic epithelial cells with live microbiota from five healthy individuals and quantified induced changes in transcriptional regulation and chromatin accessibility in host cells. We identified over 5,000 host genes that change expression, including 588 distinct associations between specific taxa and host genes. The taxa with the strongest influence on gene expression alter the response of genes associated with complex traits. Using ATAC-seq, we show that a subset of these changes in gene expression are likely the result of changes in host chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding induced by exposure to gut microbiota. We then created a manipulated microbial community with titrated doses of Collinsella, demonstrating that both natural and controlled microbiome composition leads to distinct, and predictable, gene expression profiles in host cells. Together, our results suggest that specific microbes play an important role in regulating expression of individual host genes involved in human complex traits. The ability to fine tune the expression of host genes by manipulating the microbiome suggests future therapeutic routes.",

This behavioural change could result from the parasite actively manipulating its host, but could also be explained by a mechanical effect, where the parasites physical presence affects host behaviour. We created an artificial internal parasite using silicone injections in the body cavity to test this mechanical effect hypothesis. We used the Schistocephalus solidus - threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) system, as this cestode can reach up to 92% of its fish host mass. Our results suggest that the mass burden brought by this macroparasite alone is not sufficient to cause behavioural changes in its host. Furthermore, our results show that wall-hugging (thigmotaxis), a measure of anxiety in vertebrates, is significantly reduced in Schistocephalus-infected sticklebacks, unveiling a new altered component of behaviour that may result from manipulation by this macroparasite.",

    "abstract": "ContextHigh-resolution animal movement data are becoming increasingly available, yet having a multitude of empirical trajectories alone does not allow us to easily predict animal movement. To answer ecological and evolutionary questions at a population level, quantitative estimates of a species potential to link patches or populations are of importance.\\n\\nObjectivesWe introduce an approach that combines movement-informed simulated trajectories with an environment-informed estimate of the trajectories plausibility to derive connectivity. Using the example of bar-headed geese we estimated migratory connectivity at a landscape level throughout the annual cycle in their native range.\\n\\nMethodsWe used tracking data of bar-headed geese to develop a multi-state movement model and to estimate temporally explicit habitat suitability within the species range. We simulated migratory movements between range fragments, and calculated a measure we called route viability. The results are compared to expectations derived from published literature.\\n\\nResultsSimulated migrations matched empirical trajectories in key characteristics such as stopover duration. The viability of the simulated trajectories was similar to that of the empirical trajectories. We found that, overall, the migratory connectivity was higher within the breeding than in wintering areas, corresponding to previous findings for this species.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show how empirical tracking data and environmental information can be fused for meaningful predictions of animal movements throughout the year and even outside the spatial range of the available data. Beyond predicting connectivity, our framework will prove useful for modelling ecological processes facilitated by animal movement, such as seed dispersal or disease ecology.",

Our isolation of three new strains from distant locations and environments allowed us to perform the first comparative genomics analysis of the emerging worldwide-distributed Pandoraviridae family. Thorough annotation of the genomes combining transcriptomic, proteomic, and bioinformatic analyses, led to the discovery of many non-coding transcripts while significantly reducing the former set of predicted protein-coding genes. We found that the Pandoraviridae exhibit an open pan genome, the enormous size of which is not adequately explained by gene duplications or horizontal transfers. As most of the strain specific genes have no extant homolog and exhibit statistical features comparable to intergenic regions, we suggests that de novo gene creation is a strong component in the evolution of the giant Pandoravirus genomes.",

    "abstract": "Even if a species phenotype does not change over evolutionary time, the underlying mechanism may change, as distinct molecular pathways can realize identical phenotypes. Here we use linear system theory to explore the consequences of this idea, describing how a gene network underlying a conserved phenotype evolves, as the genetic drift of small changes to these molecular pathways cause a population to explore the set of mechanisms with identical phenotypes. To do this, we model an organisms internal state as a linear system of differential equations for which the environment provides input and the phenotype is the output, in which context there exists an exact characterization of the set of all mechanisms that give the same input-output relationship. This characterization implies that selectively neutral directions in genotype space should be common and that the evolutionary exploration of these distinct but equivalent mechanisms can lead to the reproductive incompatibility of independently evolving populations. This evolutionary exploration, or system drift, is expected to proceed at a rate proportional to the amount of intrapopulation genetic variation divided by the effective population size (Ne). At biologically reasonable parameter values this could lead to substantial interpopulation incompatibility, and thus speciation, on a time scale of Ne generations. This model also naturally predicts Haldanes rule, thus providing a concrete explanation of why heterogametic hybrids tend to be disrupted more often than homogametes during the early stages of speciation.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we describe how to efficiently record the entire genetic history of a population in forwards-time, individual-based population genetics simulations with arbitrary breeding models, population structure and demography. This approach dramatically reduces the computational burden of tracking individual genomes by allowing us to simulate only those loci that may affect reproduction (those having non-neutral variants). The genetic history of the population is recorded as a succinct tree sequence as introduced in the software package msprime, on which neutral mutations can be quickly placed afterwards. Recording the results of each breeding event requires storage that grows linearly with time, but there is a great deal of redundancy in this information. We solve this storage problem by providing an algorithm to quickly  simplify a tree sequence by removing this irrelevant history for a given set of genomes. By periodically simplifying the history with respect to the extant population, we show that the total storage space required is modest and overall large efficiency gains can be made over classical forward-time simulations. We implement a general-purpose framework for recording and simplifying genealogical data, which can be used to make simulations of any population model more efficient. We modify two popular forwards-time simulation frameworks to use this new approach and observe efficiency gains in large, whole-genome simulations of one to two orders of magnitude. In addition to speed, our method for recording pedigrees has several advantages: (1) All marginal genealogies of the simulated individuals are recorded, rather than just genotypes. (2) A population of N individuals with M polymorphic sites can be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making it feasible to store a simulations entire final generation as well as its history. (3) A simulation can easily be initialized with a more efficient coalescent simulation of deep history. The software for recording and processing tree sequences is named tskit.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySexually reproducing organisms are related to the others in their species by the complex web of parent-offspring relationships that constitute the pedigree. In this paper, we describe a way to record all of these relationships, as well as how genetic material is passed down through the pedigree, during a forwards-time population genetic simulation. To make effective use of this information, we describe both efficient storage methods for this embellished pedigree as well as a way to remove all information that is irrelevant to the genetic history of a given set of individuals, which dramatically reduces the required amount of storage space. Storing this information allows us to produce whole-genome sequence from simulations of large populations in which we have not explicitly recorded new genomic mutations; we find that this results in computational run times of up to 50 times faster than simulations forced to explicitly carry along that information.",

Signal detection permits the discrimination of methylation signal from dynamic background noise that is induced by thermal fluctuation. Current genome-wide methylation analysis methods do not incorporate biophysical properties of DNA, and focus largely on DNA methylation density changes, which limits resolution of natural, more subtle methylome behavior in relation to gene activity.\\n\\nResultsWe present here a novel methylome analysis procedure, Methyl-IT, based on information thermodynamics and signal detection. Methylation analysis involves a signal detection step, and the method was designed to discriminate methylation regulatory signal from background variation. Comparisons with commonly used programs and two publicly available methylome datasets, involving stages of seed development and drought stress effects, were implemented. Information divergence between methylation levels from different groups, measured in terms of Hellinger divergence, provides discrimination power between control and treatment samples. Differentially informative methylation positions (DIMPs) achieved higher sensitivity and accuracy than standard differentially methylated positions (DMPs) identified by other methods. Differentially methylated genes (DMG) that are based on DIMPs were significantly enriched in biologically meaningful networks.\\n\\nConclusionsMethyl-IT analysis enhanced resolution of natural methylome reprogramming behavior to reveal network-associated responses, offering resolution of gene pathway influences not attainable with previous methods.",

    "abstract": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic responses is essential for hippocampal memory function. Perforant-path (PP) synapses on hippocampal granule cells (GCs) contribute to the formation of associative memories, which are considered the cellular correlates of memory engrams. However, the mechanisms of LTP at these synapses are not well understood. Due to sparse firing activity and the voltage attenuation in their dendrites, it remains unclear how associative LTP at distal synapses occurs. Here we show that NMDA receptor-dependent LTP can be induced at PP-GC synapses without backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) in acute rat brain slices. Dendritic recordings reveal substantial attenuation of bAPs as well as local dendritic Na+ -spike generation during PP-GC input. Inhibition of Na+ -spikes impairs LTP suggesting that LTP at PP-GC synapse requires local Na+ -spikes. Thus, dendritic spikes are essential for LTP induction at PP-GC synapse and may constitute a key cellular mechanism for memory formation in the dentate gyrus.",

    "abstract": "Understanding micro-evolutionary responses of mating systems to contemporary selection requires estimating sex-specific additive genetic variances and cross-sex genetic covariances in key reproductive strategy traits. One key trait comprises the occurrence of divorce versus mate-fidelity across sequential reproductive attempts. If divorce represents an evolving behavioural strategy it must have non-zero individual repeatability and heritability, but quantitative estimates from wild populations are scarce. We used 39 years of individual breeding records and pedigree data from free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to quantify sex-specific permanent individual and additive genetic variances, and hence estimate repeatability and heritability, in liability for divorce. We estimated moderate repeatability in females, but little repeatability in males. Estimates of additive genetic variance were small in both sexes, and the cross-sex genetic covariance was close to zero. However, the total heritability was likely non-zero but small, indicating low potential for micro-evolutionary response to selection. Rapid micro-evolution of divorce rate therefore appears unlikely, even if there were substantial fitness benefits of divorce and resulting selection.",

    "abstract": "The perception of gender and age of unfamiliar faces is reported to vary idiosyncratically across retinal locations such that, for example, the same androgynous face may appear to be male at one location but female at another. Here we test spatial heterogeneity for the recognition of the identity of personally familiar faces in human participants. We found idiosyncratic biases that were stable within participants and that varied more across locations for low as compared to high familiar faces. These data suggest that like face gender and age, face identity is processed, in part, by independent populations of neurons monitoring restricted spatial regions and that the recognition responses vary for the same face across these different locations. Moreover, repeated and varied social interactions appear to lead to adjustments of these independent face recognition neurons so that the same familiar face is eventually more likely to elicit the same recognition response across widely separated visual field locations. We provide a mechanistic account of this reduced retinotopic bias based on computational simulations.\\n\\nSignificance statementIn this work we tested spatial heterogeneity for the recognition of personally familiar faces. We found retinotopic biases that varied more across locations for low as compared to highly familiar faces. The retinotopic biases were idiosyncratic and stable within participants. Our data suggest that, like face gender and age, face identity is processed by independent populations of neurons monitoring restricted spatial regions and that recognition may vary for the same face at these different locations. Unlike previous findings, our data and computational simulation address the effects of learning and show how increased familiarity modifies the representation of face identity in face-responsive cortical areas. This new perspective has broader implications for understanding how learning optimizes visual processes for socially salient stimuli.",

Binding of K+ induces a conformational change in Kbp, resulting in an increase in FRET efficiency. KIRIN1 was able to detect K+ at physiologically relevant concentrations in vitro and is highly selective toward K+ over Na+. We further demonstrated that KIRIN1 allowed real-time imaging of pharmacologically induced depletion of cytosolic K+ in live cells, and KIRIN1 also enabled optical tracing of K+ efflux and reuptake in neurons upon glutamate stimulation in cultured primary neurons. These results demonstrate that KIRIN1 is a valuable tool to detect K+ in vitro and in live cells.",

    "abstract": "The morphology of individual neurons is useful to study structures and functions of nervous system. Researchers have invented many semi or fully automatic tracing methods to efficiently generate a reconstruction from a single neuron. Different tracing methods have different design principles, and could produce different reconstructions. However, the \\\"common substructures\\\" of various reconstructions, called morphological motifs, should be highly reliable. In this work, we propose a Vaa3D based framework to explore morphological motifs of 3D reconstructions from a single neuron. The framework contains four steps: (1) resampling and sorting each reconstruction according to a standard reconstruction, such as a gold standard reconstruction, consensus reconstruction or a certain reliable reconstruction; (2) applying local alignment algorithm for each pair of the standard reconstruction and a reconstruction, or each pair of two reconstructions; (3) constructing overlaps based on selected points in local alignment pairs; (4) obtaining morphological motifs by post-processing these overlaps. Under the proposed framework, three methods were implemented and tested on a dataset of 73 fruitfly neurons released by the BigNeuron project (http://bigneuron.org), which contains a gold standard reconstruction, a consensus reconstruction and about 40 automatic reconstructions for each neuron. We quantitatively evaluated these three methods to choose reliable morphological motifs.",

However, the characterization of the spatial organization of individual cells within a tissue has been more elusive. The recently introduced  spatial transcriptomics method (ST) reveals the spatial pattern of gene expression within a tissue section at a resolution of a thousand 100 m spots across the tissue, each capturing the transcriptomes of [~]10-20 cells. Here, we present an approach for the integration of scRNA-Seq and ST data generated from the same sample of pancreatic cancer tissue. Using markers for cell types identified by scRNA-Seq, we robustly deconvolved the cell type composition of each ST spot to generate a spatial atlas of cell proportions across the tissue. Studying this atlas, we found that distinct spatial localizations accompany each of the cell populations that we identified.

    "abstract": "Polyploidy or whole genome duplication (WGD) is a major contributor to genome evolution and diversity. Although polyploidy is recognized as an important component of plant evolution, it is generally considered to play a relatively minor role in animal evolution. Ancient polyploidy is found in the ancestry of some animals, especially fishes, but there is little evidence for ancient WGDs in other metazoan lineages. Here we use recently published transcriptomes and genomes from more than 150 species across the insect phylogeny to investigate whether ancient WGDs occurred during the evolution of Hexapoda, the most diverse clade of animals. Using gene age distributions and phylogenomics, we found evidence for 18 ancient WGDs and six other large-scale bursts of gene duplication during insect evolution. These bursts of gene duplication occurred in the history of lineages such as the Lepidoptera, Trichoptera, and Odonata. To further corroborate the nature of these duplications, we evaluated the pattern of gene retention from putative WGDs observed in the gene age distributions. We found a relatively strong signal of convergent gene retention across many of the putative insect WGDs. Considering the phylogenetic breadth and depth of the insect phylogeny, this observation is consistent with polyploidy as we expect dosage-balance to drive the parallel retention of genes. Together with recent research on plant evolution, our hexapod results suggest that genome duplications contributed to the evolution of two of the most diverse lineages of eukaryotes on Earth.",

    "abstract": "MotivationTranscription factor (TF) binds to the promoter region of a gene to control gene expression. Identifying precise transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) is essential for understanding the detailed mechanisms of TF mediated gene regulation. However, there is a shortage of computational approach that can deliver single base pair (bp) resolution prediction of TFBS.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper, we propose DeepSNR, a Deep Learning algorithm for predicting transcription factor binding location at Single Nucleotide Resolution de novo from DNA sequence. DeepSNR adopts a novel deconvolutional network (deconvNet) model and is inspired by the similarity to image segmentation by deconvNet. The proposed deconvNet architecture is constructed on top of  Deep-Bind and we trained the entire model using TF specific data from ChIP-exonuclease (ChIP-exo) experiments. DeepSNR has been shown to outperform motif search based methods for several evaluation metrics. We have also demonstrated the usefulness of DeepSNR in the regulatory analysis of TFBS as well as in improving the TFBS prediction specificity using ChIP-seq data.\\n\\nAvailabilityDeepSNR is available open source in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/sirajulsalekin/DeepSNR)\\n\\nContactyufei.huang@utsa.edu",

    "abstract": "Opioid receptors (ORs) precisely modulate behavior when activated by native peptide ligands but distort behaviors to produce pathology when activated by non-peptide drugs. A fundamental question is how drugs differ from peptides in their actions on target neurons. One way that drugs can differ is by imposing selective effects on the conformational equilibrium of individual ORs. We wondered if drugs can also impose selective effects on the location of OR activation in individual OR-expressing neurons. Here we develop a genetically encoded biosensor that directly localizes ligand-induced activation and deactivation of ORs in living cells, and use it to generate the first real-time map of the spatiotemporal organization of - and {delta}-OR activation in neurons. Peptide agonists produce a characteristic activation pattern initiated in the plasma membrane and propagating to endosomes after receptor internalization. Drugs produce a different activation pattern by uniquely driving OR activation in the somatic Golgi apparatus and extending throughout the dendritic arbor in Golgi outposts. These results demonstrate a new approach to probe the cellular basis of neuromodulation and reveal that drugs profoundly distort the spatiotemporal landscape of neuronal OR activation.",

    "abstract": "Selenoproteins containing selenium in the form of selenocysteine are critical for bone remodelling. However, their mechanism of action is not well understood. Here, we report the identification of selenoprotein W (SELENOW) through large-scale mRNA profiling of receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-{kappa}B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation, as a protein that is downregulated via RANKL/RANK/tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6/p38 signalling. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that SELENOW regulates osteoclastogenic genes. SELENOW overexpression enhanced osteoclastogenesis in vitro via nuclear translocation of NF-{kappa}B and nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1, whereas its loss suppressed osteoclast formation. SELENOW-deficient and SELENOW-overexpressing mice exhibited osteopetrosis and osteoporosis, respectively. Ectopic SELENOW expression stimulated cell-cell fusion critical for osteoclast maturation as well as bone resorption. Thus, RANKL-dependent repression of SELENOW maintains proper osteoclast differentiation and blocks osteoporosis caused by overactive osteoclasts. These findings demonstrate a biological link between selenium and bone metabolism.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDGenetic disorders are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in infants. Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS) can diagnose genetic disorders in time to change acute medical or surgical management (clinical utility) and improve outcomes in acutely ill infants.\\n\\nMETHODSRetrospective cohort study of acutely ill inpatient infants in a regional childrens hospital from July 2016-March 2017. Forty-two families received rWGS for etiologic diagnosis of genetic disorders. Probands received standard genetic testing as clinically indicated. Primary end-points were rate of diagnosis, clinical utility, and healthcare utilization. The latter was modelled in six infants by comparing actual utilization with matched historical controls and/or counterfactual utilization had rWGS been performed at different time points.\\n\\nFINDINGSThe diagnostic sensitivity was 43% (eighteen of 42 infants) for rWGS and 10% (four of 42 infants) for standard of care (P=.0005). The rate of clinical utility for rWGS (31%, thirteen of 42 infants) was significantly greater than for standard of care (2%, one of 42; P=.0015). Eleven (26%) infants with diagnostic rWGS avoided morbidity, one had 43% reduction in likelihood of mortality, and one started palliative care. In six of the eleven infants, the changes in management reduced inpatient cost by $800, 000 to $2,000,000.\\n\\nDISCUSSIONThese findings replicate a prior study of the clinical utility of rWGS in acutely ill inpatient infants, and demonstrate improved outcomes and net healthcare savings. rWGS merits consideration as a first tier test in this setting.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic risk variant adjacent to the homeobox transcription factor PITX2 in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Experimental studies demonstrated that Pitx2 insufficiency leads to cellular and molecular substrates that increased atrial arrhythmias susceptibility. Pitx2 expression is present not only in the atrial but also in the ventricular myocytes. This study aims to investigate if insufficiency of Pitx2 in the developing and adult ventricular chambers increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias. Conditional Pitx2 loss-offunction ventricular chamber-specific (Mlc2v-Cre) mouse mutants were generated using Cre/loxP technology. Pitx2 insufficiency in the ventricular myocardium leads interventricular septal thickening during cardiogenesis but else mice are viable until adulthood. Adult Mlc2vCre+Pitx2-/- hearts display hypertrophic and dilated ventricular chambers. ECG recordings demonstrated that Mlc2vCre+Pitx2-/- mice display increased QT and QRS intervals. Molecular analyses demonstrate that repolarization but not depolarization is severely impaired in these mutants. Microarrays analysis identified mRNAs and microRNAs altered in Pitx2 ventricular-specific mutants and provide evidences for miR-1 and miR-148 deregulation which in turn modulate Klf4 and distinct ion channel expression linked to cardiac hypertrophy and long QT-like defects. Our data demonstrate that Pitx2 insufficiency play leads to cellular and molecular ventricular remodeling which results in hypertrophic and dilated ventricular chambers and electrophysiological defects resembling long QT syndrome.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe aims of this study were to determine the prevalence, incidence, and P/I ratio of Parkinsons disease (PD) in South Korea and to present basic epidemiological information on PD patients for making effective health policies.\\n\\nMethodsWe used National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (KNHIS-NSC) data to analyze the prevalence, incidence, and P/I ratio of PD from 2003 to 2013 and then followed up using the NHID in 2008 to obtain the hazard ratio (HR) of death in PD itself and other comorbidities from 2008 to 2013.\\n\\nResultsThe prevalence and incidence of PD increased rapidly from 72.9 and 32.8 in 2003 to 213.4 and 58.0 in 2013, and the P/I ratio increased from 2.22 in 2003 to 3.62 in 2013. The prevalence, incidence, and P/I ratio of PD were all higher in women than in men. The hazard ratio for death was significantly higher in PD patients (15.36) compared to subjects without the disease. Stroke was the most frequent cause of death in the PD patient population followed by cancer and pneumonia.\\n\\nConclusionThe prevalence, incidence, and P/I ratio of PD rapidly increased as the years progressed. This indirectly proves that the health insurance system in Korea is efficient and has allowed patients with PD to access medical facilities more easily. However, a newer public healthy strategy should be established for patients with PD because PD itself has a high HR for death, and patients with PD have a high mortality rate when stroke and pneumonia are also involved.\\n\\nDisclosureAll authors have reported no biomedical interests and potential conflicts of interests.",

    "abstract": "Inspite of the global reduction of 21% in malaria incidence between 2010 and 2015, the disease still threatens many lives of children and pregnant mothers in African countries. A correct assessment and evaluation of the impact of malaria control strategies still remains quintessential in order to eliminate the disease and its burden. Malaria follow-up studies typically involve routine visits at pre-scheduled time points and/or clinical visits whenever individuals experience malaria-like symptoms. In the latter case, infection triggers outcome assessment, thereby leading to outcome-dependent sampling (ODS). Ordinary methods used to analyse such longitudinal data ignore ODS and potentially lead to biased estimates of malaria-specific transmission parameters, hence, inducing an incorrect assessment and evaluation of malaria control strategies. In this paper, we propose novel methodology to handle ODS using a joint model for the longitudinal binary outcome measured at routine visits and the clinical event times. The methodology is applied to malaria parasitaemia data from a cohort of n = 988 Ugandan children aged 0.5-10 years from 3 regions (Walukuba - 300 children, Kihihi - 355 children and Nagongera - 333 children) with varying transmission intensities (entomological inoculation rate equal to 2.8, 32 and 310 infectious bites per unit year, respectively) collected between 2011-2014. The results indicate that malaria parasite prevalence and force of infection (FOI) increase with age in the region of high malaria intensities with FOI highest in age group 5-10 years. For the region of medium intensity, the prevalence slightly increases with age and the FOI for the routine process is highest in age group 5-10 years yet for the clinically observed infections, the FOI gradually decreases with increasing age. For the region with low intensity, both the prevalence and FOI peak at the age of one year after which the former remains constant with age yet the latter suddenly decreases with age for the clinically observed infections. In all study sites, both the prevalence and FOI are highest among previously asymptomatic children and lowest among their symptomatic counterparts. Using a simulation study inspired by the malaria data at hand, the proposed methodology shows to have the smallest bias, especially when consecutive positive malaria parasitaemia presence results within a time period of 35 days were considered to be due to the same infection.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the temporal evolution of the distribution of immunities in a population, which is determined by various epidemiological, immunological and demographical phenomena: after a disease outbreak, recovered individuals constitute a large immune population, however their immunity is waning in the long term and they may become susceptible again. Meanwhile, their immunity can be boosted by repeated exposure to the pathogen, which is linked to the density of infected individuals present in the population. This prolongs the length of their immunity.\\n\\nWe consider a mathematical model formulated as a coupled system of ordinary and partial differential equations, that connects all these processes, and systematically compare a number of boosting assumptions proposed in the literature, showing that different boosting mechanisms lead to very different stationary distributions of the immunity at the endemic steady state. In the situation of periodic disease outbreaks, the waveforms of immunity distributions are studied and visualized. Our results show that there is a possibility to infer the boosting mechanism from the population level immune-dynamics.\\n\\nAMS Classification92D30, 34K60, 34K34, 37M05",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9 has become a powerful genome editing tool in recent years. CRISPR/Cas9 can be utilized to not only efficiently generate knock out models in various organisms, but also to precisely model human disease or variants to study gene function and develop therapies. However, the latter remains challenging because of low knock-in (KI) efficiency. In this study, precise gene editing modeling plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) -tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) binding deficiency and PAI-1-vitronectin binding deficiency were generated respectively in mice. Optimization of single guide RNAs (sgRNA) and repair templates, and utilization of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to detect KI events are described. Injection of sgRNA/Cas9/single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) into mouse zygotes resulted in homozygous changes of two silent mutations and changed Arg369>Ala, which abolishes PAI-1 inhibitory activity against tPA. Targeting Arg124 and Gln146 simultaneously involved in vitronectin binding proved to be challenging. However, we successfully generated these relatively distant mutations (23 amino acids apart) seamlessly. Generation of the Arg124 mutation alone was achieved with over 60% efficiency along with the integration of a restriction site, compared to the relatively low double mutation frequency. In summary, our data indicates that the distance between desired mutations and CRISPR-induced double-stranded break (DSB) site is the most critical factor for achieving high efficiency in precise gene modification.",

    "abstract": "Heat shock factors (Hsfs) are transcription factors that regulate response to heat shock and to variety of other environmental and physiological stimuli. Four HSFs (HSF1-4) known in vertebrates till date, perform a wide variety of functions from mediating heat shock response to development and gametogenesis. Here, we describe a new yet conserved member of HSF family, Hsf5, which likely exclusively functions for spermatogenesis. The hsf5 is predominantly expressed in developing testicular tissues, in comparison to wider expression reported for other HSFs. HSF5 loss causes male sterility due to drastically reduced sperm count, and severe abnormalities in remaining few spermatozoa. While hsf5 mutant female did not show any abnormality. We show that Hsf5 is required for progression through meiotic prophase 1 during spermatogenesis. The hsf5 mutants indeed show misregulation of a substantial number of genes regulating cell cycle, DNA-damage repair, apoptosis and cytoskeleton proteins. We also show that Hsf5 physically binds to majority of these differentially expressed genes, suggesting its direct role in regulating the expression of many genes important for spermatogenesis.",
