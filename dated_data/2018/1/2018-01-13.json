    "abstract": "Correlated fluctuations of single neuron discharges, on a mesoscopic scale, decrease as a function of lateral distance in early sensory cortices, reflecting a rapid spatial decay of lateral connection probability and excitation. However, spatial periodicities in horizontal connectivity and associational input as well as an enhanced probability of lateral excitatory connections in the association cortex could theoretically result in non-monotonic correlation structures. Here we show such a spatially non-monotonic correlation structure, characterized by significantly positive long-range correlations, in the inferior convexity of the macaque prefrontal cortex. This functional connectivity kernel was more pronounced during wakefulness than anesthesia and could be largely attributed to the spatial pattern of correlated variability between functionally similar neurons during structured visual stimulation. These results suggest that the spatial decay of lateral functional connectivity is not a common organizational principle of neocortical microcircuits. A non-monotonic correlation structure could reflect a critical topological feature of prefrontal microcircuits, facilitating their role in integrative processes.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe spatial structure of correlated activity of neurons in lower-order visual areas has been shown to linearly decrease as a measure of distance. The shape of correlated variability is a defining feature of cortical microcircuits as it constrains the computational power and diversity of a region. We show here for the first time a non-monotonic spatial structure of functional connectivity in the pre-frontal cortex where distal interactions are just as strong as proximal interactions during visual engagement of functionally similar PFC neurons. Such a nonmonotonic structure of functional connectivity could have far-reaching consequences in rethinking the nature and the role of prefrontal microcircuits in various cognitive states.",

    "abstract": "Changes in pathogen genetic variation within hosts alter the severity and spread of infectious diseases, with important implications for clinical disease and public health. Genetic drift may play a strong role in shaping pathogen variation, but analyses of drift in pathogens have oversimplified pathogen population dynamics, either by considering dynamics only at a single scale (within hosts, between hosts), or by making drastic simplifying assumptions (host immune systems can be ignored, transmission bottlenecks are complete). Moreover, previous studies used genetic data to infer the strength of genetic drift, whereas we test whether the genetic drift imposed by pathogen population processes can be used to explain genetic data. We first constructed and parameterized a mathematical model of gypsy moth baculovirus dynamics that allows genetic drift to act within and between hosts. We then quantified the genome-wide diversity of baculovirus populations within each of 143 field-collected gypsy moth larvae using Illumina sequencing. Finally, we determined whether the genetic drift imposed by host-pathogen population dynamics in our model explains the levels of pathogen diversity in our data. We found that when the model allows drift to act at multiple scales, including within hosts, between hosts, and between years, it can accurately reproduce the data, but when the effects of drift are simplified by neglecting transmission bottlenecks and stochastic variation in virus replication within hosts, the model fails. A de novo mutation model and a purifying selection model similarly fail to explain the data. Our results show that genetic drift can play a strong role in determining pathogen variation, and that mathematical models that account for pathogen population growth at multiple scales of biological organization can be used to explain this variation.",

    "abstract": "Elucidation of population-level diversity of microbiomes is a significant step towards a complete understanding of the evolutionary, ecological and functional importance of microbial communities. Characterizing this diversity requires the recovery of the exact DNA sequence (haplotype) of each gene isoform from every individual present in the community. To address this, we present Hansel and Gretel: a freely-available data structure and algorithm, providing a software package that reconstructs the most likely haplotypes from metagenomes. We demonstrate recovery of haplotypes from short-read Illumina data for a bovine rumen microbiome, and verify our predictions are 100% accurate with long-read PacBio CCS sequencing. We show that Gretels haplotypes can be analyzed to determine a significant difference in mutation rates between core and accessory gene families in an ovine rumen microbiome.

    "abstract": "Task learning relies on brain executive function (EF), the construct of controlling and coordinating behavior under the everlasting flow of environmental changes. We have previously shown, that a complete knockout of a vertebrate brain-specific pair of gene paralogs (Ntng1/2) distorts the mouse EF, making behavior less predictable (more variable) via the affected working memory and attention (1). In the current study, conditionally targeting either serotonin transporter (5-HTT) or Emx1-expressing neurons, we show that the cell type-specific ablation of Ntng1 within the excitatory circuits of either cortex or thalamus does not have a profound impact on the EF but rather affects its certain modalities, i.e. impulsivity and/or selective attention, modulated by cognitive demand. Several mice of both conditional genotypes simultaneously occupy either top or bottom parameter-specific behavioral ranks, indicative of a subject-unique antagonistic either proficit or deficit of function within the same behavior. Employing genotype-attributable behavior variability as a phenotypic trait, we deduce, that Ntng1-parsed excitatory pathways contribute but do not fully reconstitute the attention-impulsivity phenotypes, associated with the mouse EF deficit. However, complete knockdown of Ntng1/2, and associated with it behavior variability, explains the deficit of executive function and task learning.",

    "abstract": "More than a hundred years after Griggs influential analysis of species borders, the causes of limits to species ranges still represent a puzzle that has never been understood with clarity. The topic has become especially important recently as many scientists have become interested in the potential for species ranges to shift in response to climate change - and yet, nearly all of those studies fail to recognise or incorporate evolutionary genetics in a way that relates to theoretical developments. I show that range margins can be understood based on just two measurable parameters: i) the fitness cost of dispersal - a measure of environmental heterogeneity - and ii) the strength of genetic drift, which reduces genetic diversity. Together, these two parameters define an expansion threshold: adaptation fails when genetic drift reduces genetic diversity below that required for adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. When the key parameters drop below this expansion threshold locally, a sharp range margin forms. When they drop below this threshold throughout the species range, adaptation collapses everywhere, resulting in either extinction, or formation of a fragmented meta-population. Because the effects of dispersal differ fundamentally with dimension, the second parameter - the strength of genetic drift - is qualitatively different compared to a linear habitat. In two-dimensional habitats, genetic drift becomes effectively independent of selection. It decreases with neighbourhood size - the number of individuals accessible by dispersal within one generation. Moreover, in contrast to earlier predictions, which neglected evolution of genetic variance and/or stochasticity in two dimensions, dispersal into small marginal populations aids adaptation. This is because the reduction of both genetic and demographic stochasticity has a stronger effect than the cost of dispersal through increased maladaptation. The expansion threshold thus provides a novel, theoretically justified and testable prediction for formation of the range margin and collapse of the species range.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGene flow across environments has conflicting effects: while it increases the genetic variation necessary for adaptation and counters the loss of genetic diversity due to genetic drift, it may also swamp adaptation to local conditions. This interplay is crucial for the dynamics of a species range expansion, which can thus be understood based on two dimensionless parameters: i) the fitness cost of dispersal - a measure of environmental heterogeneity - and ii) the strength of genetic drift - a measure of reduction of genetic diversity. Together, these two parameters define an expansion threshold: adaptation fails when the number of individuals accessible by dispersal within one generation is so small that genetic drift reduces genetic diversity below the level required for adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. This threshold provides a novel, theoretically justified and testable prediction for formation of a range margin and a collapse of a species range in two-dimensional habitats.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic sampling methods are becoming increasingly important in biological monitoring. Sound attenuation is one of the most important dynamics affecting the utility of bioacoustic data as it directly affects the probability of detection of individuals from bioacoustic arrays and especially the localization of acoustic signals necessary in telemetry studies. Therefore, models of sound attenuation are necessary to make efficient use of bioacoustic data in ecological monitoring and assessment applications. Models of attenuation in widespread use are based on Euclidean distance between source and sensor, which is justified under spherical attenuation of sound waves in homogeneous environments. In some applications there are efforts to evaluate the detection range of sensors in response to local environmental characteristics at the sensor or at sentinel source locations with known environmental characteristics. However, attenuation is a function of the total environment between source and sensor, not just their locations. In this paper I develop a model of signal attenuation based on a non-Euclidean cost-weighted distance metric which contains resistance parameters that relate to environmental heterogeneity in the vicinity of an array. Importantly, these parameters can be estimated by maximum likelihood using experimental data from an array of fixed sources, thus allowing investigators who use bioacoustic methods to devise explicit models of sound attenuation in situ. In addition, drawing on analogy with classes of models known as spatial capture-recapture, I show that parameters of the non-Euclidean model of attenuation can be estimated when source locations are unknown. Thus, the models can be applied to real field studies which require localization of signals in heterogeneous environments.",

We developed a straightforward approach to ablate genes in up to 90% of cells and to introduce precisely targeted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in up to 25% of the transfected primary T cells. We used gene editing-mediated allele switching to quantify homology directed repair (HDR), systematically optimize experimental parameters and map a native B cell epitope in primary T cells. Allele switching of a surrogate cell surface marker can be used to enrich cells with successful simultaneous editing of a second gene of interest. Finally, we applied the approach to correct two disease-causing mutations in the Foxp3 gene. Both repairing the cause of the scurfy syndrome, a 2bp insertion in Foxp3, and repairing the clinically relevant Foxp3K276X mutation restored Foxp3 expression in primary T cells.",

Here, we investigated the hypothesis that the STM evidence base is weak. We performed systematic review and meta-analysis of the field. Using metrics to quantify variation between discovery articles and follow-up studies, we found that seven genes were both highly replicated, and highly reproducible. However, ~80% of STM genes have never been replicated. While only a few studies investigated interactions, the reviewed genes could account for >1000% memory. This large summed effect size could indicate irreproducibility, many shared pathways, or that current assay protocols lack the specificity needed to identify core plasticity genes. Mechanistic theories of memory will require the convergence of evidence from system, circuit, cellular, molecular, and genetic experiments; systematic data synthesis is an essential tool for integrated neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is mediated by a conserved family of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts). The human genome encodes five Dnmts: Dnmt1, Dnmt2, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b and Dnmt3L. Despite their high degree of conservation among different species, genes encoding Dnmts have been duplicated and/or lost in multiple lineages throughout evolution, indicating that the DNA methylation machinery has some potential to undergo evolutionary change. However, little is known about the extent to which this machinery, or the methylome, varies among vertebrates. Here, we study the molecular evolution of Dnmt1, the enzyme responsible for maintenance of DNA methylation patterns after replication, in 79 vertebrate species. Our analyses show that all studied species exhibit a single copy of DNMT1, with the exception of tilapia and marsupials (tammar wallaby, koala, Tasmanian devil and opossum), each of which exhibits two apparently functional DNMT1 copies. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that DNMT1 duplicated before the divergence of marsupials (i.e., at least ~75 million years ago), thus giving rise to two DNMT1 copies in marsupials (copy 1 and copy 2). In the opossum lineage, copy 2 was lost, and copy 1 recently duplicated again, generating three DNMT1 copies: two putatively functional genes (copy 1a and 1b) and one pseudogene (copy 1{psi}). Both marsupial copies (DNMT1 copies 1 and 2) are under purifying selection, and copy 2 exhibits elevated rates of evolution and signatures of positive selection, suggesting a scenario of neofunctionalization. This gene duplication might have resulted in modifications in marsupial methylomes and their dynamics.",

Moth pheromone orientation is a good model to investigate the neuronal mechanisms of olfactory behavior. Based on mass staining and single-cell staining, we evaluated the anatomical organization of neurite distribution by DNs in the brain. Dense innervation was observed in the posterior ventral part of the brain, called the posterior slope (PS). We examined the morphology of DNs innervating the lateral accessory lobe (LAL), which is assumed to be important for moth olfactory behavior. We observed that the LAL DNs also innervate the PS, suggesting the integration of signals from the LAL and PS. We also identified a set of DNs innervating the PS, but not the LAL. These DNs were sensitive to sex pheromones, suggesting a role of the PS in motor control for pheromone orientation. The organization of descending pathways for pheromone orientation is discussed.",
