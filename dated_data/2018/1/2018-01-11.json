    "abstract": "Adult Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies were placed into one end of a tube near to repellents (benzaldehyde and heat) and away from the other end containing attractants (light and a favored temperature). They escaped from the repellents and went to the attractants. Five motile mutants that failed to do that were isolated. They did not respond to any external attractants tested or external repellents tested. In addition, they did not respond well to internal sensory stimuli like hunger, thirst, and sleep. The mutants, although motile, failed to respond to stimuli at both 34{degrees}C and at room temperature. Some of the mutants have been mapped. It is proposed that the information from the different sensory receptors comes together at an intermediate, called \\\"inbetween\\\" (Inbet), that brings about a behavioral response. The Boss is defined here.",

    "abstract": "MotivationCurrent bioinformatics methods to detect changes in gene isoform usage in distinct phenotypes compare the relative expected isoform usage in phenotypes. These statistics model differences in isoform usage in normal tissues, which have stable regulation of gene splicing. Pathological conditions, such as cancer, can have broken regulation of splicing that increases the heterogeneity of the expression of splice variants. Inferring events with such differential heterogeneity in gene isoform usage requires new statistical approaches.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce Splice Expression Variability Analysis (SEVA) to model increased heterogeneity of splice variant usage between conditions (e.g., tumor and normal samples). SEVA uses a rank-based multivariate statistic that compares the variability of junction expression profiles within one condition to the variability within another. Simulated data show that SEVA is unique in modeling heterogeneity of gene isoform usage, and benchmark SEVAs performance against EBSeq, DiffSplice, and rMATS that model differential isoform usage instead of heterogeneity. We confirm the accuracy of SEVAin identifying known splice variants in head and neck cancer and perform cross-study validation of novel splice variants. A novel comparison of splice variant heterogeneity between subtypes of head and neck cancer demonstrated unanticipated similarity between the heterogeneity of gene isoform usage in HPV-positive and HPV-negative subtypes and anticipated increased heterogeneity among HPV-negative samples with mutations in genes that regulate the splice variant machinery.\\n\\nConclusionThese results show that SEVA accurately models differential heterogeneity of gene isoform usage from RNA-seq data.\\n\\nAvailabilitySEVA is implemented in the R/Bioconductor package GSReg.\\n\\nContactbahman@jhu.edu, favorov@sensi.org, ejfertig@jhmi.edu",

    "abstract": "p53 as an effector of nucleolar stress is well defined, but p53 independent mechanisms are largely unknown. Like p53, the NF-{kappa}B transcription factor plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress. Many stresses that stimulate NF-{kappa}B also disrupt nucleoli. However, the link between nucleolar function and activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway is as yet unknown. Here we demonstrate that siRNA silencing of PolI complex components stimulates NF-{kappa}B signalling. Unlike p53 nucleolar stress response, this effect does not appear to be linked to inhibition of rDNA transcription. We show that specific stress stimuli of NF-{kappa}B induce degradation of a critical component of the PolI complex, TIF-IA. This degradation precedes activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway and is associated with an atypical nucleolar architecture. It is mimicked by CDK4 inhibition and is dependent upon upstream binding factor (UBF) and p14ARF. We show that blocking stress effects on TIF-IA blocks their ability to activate the NF-{kappa}B pathway. Finally, using ex vivo culture, we show a strong correlation between degradation of TIF-IA and activation of NF-{kappa}B in freshly resected, human colorectal tumours exposed to the chemopreventative agent, aspirin. Together, our study provides compelling evidence for a new, NF-{kappa}B nucleolar stress response pathway that has in vivo relevance and therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "Correlated fluctuations of single neuron discharges, on a mesoscopic scale, decrease as a function of lateral distance in early sensory cortices, reflecting a rapid spatial decay of lateral connection probability and excitation. However, spatial periodicities in horizontal connectivity and associational input as well as an enhanced probability of lateral excitatory connections in the association cortex could theoretically result in non-monotonic correlation structures. Here we show such a spatially non-monotonic correlation structure, characterized by significantly positive long-range correlations, in the inferior convexity of the macaque prefrontal cortex. This functional connectivity kernel was more pronounced during wakefulness than anesthesia and could be largely attributed to the spatial pattern of correlated variability between functionally similar neurons during structured visual stimulation. These results suggest that the spatial decay of lateral functional connectivity is not a common organizational principle of neocortical microcircuits. A non-monotonic correlation structure could reflect a critical topological feature of prefrontal microcircuits, facilitating their role in integrative processes.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe spatial structure of correlated activity of neurons in lower-order visual areas has been shown to linearly decrease as a measure of distance. The shape of correlated variability is a defining feature of cortical microcircuits as it constrains the computational power and diversity of a region. We show here for the first time a non-monotonic spatial structure of functional connectivity in the pre-frontal cortex where distal interactions are just as strong as proximal interactions during visual engagement of functionally similar PFC neurons. Such a nonmonotonic structure of functional connectivity could have far-reaching consequences in rethinking the nature and the role of prefrontal microcircuits in various cognitive states.",

Previous phenomenological studies of the yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria have demonstrated strong positive sexual and fecundity selection on male and female size. Nevertheless, the body size of flies from a Swiss study population has declined by almost 10% from 1993 to 2009. Given substantial heritability of body size, this negative evolutionary response of an evidently positively selected trait suggests important selective factors being missed (e.g. size-selective predation or parasitism). A periodic epidemic outbreak of the fungus Entomophthora scatophagae allowedassessment of selection exerted by this parasite fatal to adult flies. Fungal infection varied over the season from ca. 50% in the cooler and more humid spring and autumn to almost 0% in summer. The probability of dying from fungal infection increased with adult body size. All infected females died before laying eggs, so there was no fungus impact on female fecundity beyond its impact on mortality. Large males showed the typical mating advantage in the field, but this pattern of positive sexual selection was nullified by fungal infection. Mean fluctuating asymmetry of paired appendages (legs, wings) did not affect the viability, fecundity or mating success of yellow dung flies in the field. This study demonstrates rare parasite-mediated disadvantages of large adult body size in the field. Reduced ability to combat parasites such as Entomophthora may be an immunity cost of large size in dung flies, although the hypothesized trade-off between fluctuating asymmetry, a presumed indicator of developmental instability and environmental stress, and immunocompetence was not found here.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSialic acids are nine carbon sugars ubiquitously found on the surfaces of vertebrate cells and are involved in various immune response-related processes. In humans, at least 58 genes spanning diverse functions, from biosynthesis and activation to recycling and degradation, are involved in sialic acid biology. Because of their role in immunity, sialic acid biology genes have been hypothesized to exhibit elevated rates of evolutionary change. Consistent with this hypothesis, several genes involved in sialic acid biology have experienced higher rates of non-synonymous substitutions in the human lineage than their counterparts in other great apes, perhaps in response to ancient pathogens that infected hominins millions of years ago (paleopathogens). To test whether sialic acid biology genes have also experienced more recent positive selection during the evolution of the modern human lineage, reflecting adaptation to contemporary cosmopolitan or geographically-restricted pathogens, we examined whether their protein-coding regions showed evidence of recent hard and soft selective sweeps. This examination involved the calculation of four measures that quantify changes in allele frequency spectra, extent of population differentiation, and haplotype homozygosity caused by recent hard and soft selective sweeps for 55 sialic acid biology genes using publicly available whole genome sequencing data from 1,668 humans from three ethnic groups. To disentangle evidence for selection from confounding demographic effects, we compared the observed patterns in sialic acid biology genes to simulated sequences of the same length under a model of neutral evolution that takes into account human demographic history. We found that the patterns of genetic variation of most sialic acid biology genes did not significantly deviate from neutral expectations and were not significantly different among genes belonging to different functional categories. Those few sialic acid biology genes that significantly deviated from neutrality either experienced soft sweeps or population-specific hard sweeps. Interestingly, while most hard sweeps occurred on genes involved in sialic acid recognition, most soft sweeps involved genes associated with recycling, degradation and activation, transport, and transfer functions. We propose that the lack of signatures of recent positive selection for the majority of the sialic acid biology genes is consistent with the view that these genes regulate immune responses against ancient rather than contemporary cosmopolitan or geographically restricted pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Speech is an inherently noisy and ambiguous signal. In order to fluently derive meaning, a listener must integrate contextual information to guide interpretations of the sensory input. While many studies have demonstrated the influence of prior context, the neural mechanisms supporting the integration of subsequent information remain unknown. Using magnetoencephalography, we analysed responses to spoken words with a varyingly ambiguous onset phoneme, the identity of which is later disambiguated at the lexical uniqueness point1. Our results uncover a three-level processing network. Subphonemic detail is preserved in primary auditory cortex over long timescales, and re-evoked at subsequent phoneme positions. Commitments to phonological categories occur in parallel, resolving on the shorter time-scale of ~450 ms. Finally, predictions are formed over likely lexical items. These findings provide evidence that future input determines the perception of earlier speech sounds by maintaining sensory features until they can be optimally integrated with top-down information.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, neuroscience research has illuminated the neural mechanisms supporting learning from reward feedback, demonstrating a critical role for the striatum and midbrain dopamine system. Learning paradigms are increasingly being extended to understand learning dysfunctions in mood and psychiatric disorders as well as addiction in the area of computational psychiatry. However, one potentially critical characteristic that this research ignores is the effect of time on learning: human feedback learning paradigms are conducted in a single rapidly paced session, while learning experiences in ecologically relevant circumstances and in animal research are almost always separated by longer periods of time. Event spacing is known to have strong positive effects on item memory across species and in reward learning in animals. Remarkably, the effect of spaced training on human reinforcement learning has not been investigated. In our experiments, we examined reward learning distributed across weeks vs. learning completed in a traditionally-paced or \\\"massed\\\" single session. Participants learned to make the best response for landscape stimuli that were either associated with a positive or negative value. In our first study, as expected, we found that after equal amounts of extensive training, accuracy was high and equivalent between the spaced and massed conditions. However, in a final online test 3 weeks later, we found that participants exhibited significantly greater memory for the value of spaced-trained stimuli. In our second study, our methods allowed for a direct comparison of maintenance of conditioning. We found that spaced training again had a beneficial effect: more than 87% of conditioning was maintained for spaced-trained stimuli, while only 30% was maintained for massed-trained stimuli. In addition, supporting a role for working memory in massed learning, across both studies we found a significant positive correlation between initial learning and working memory capacity. Our results indicate that single-session learning tasks may not lead to the kind of robust and lasting value associations that are characteristic of \\\"habitual\\\" value associations. Overall, these studies begin to address a large gap in our knowledge of fundamental processes of human reinforcement learning, with potentially broad implications for our understanding of learning in mood disorders and addiction.",

To help resolve these discrepancies, we examined developmental trajectories using three independent longitudinal samples of participants in the age-span of 8-22 years (total 216 participants and 467 scans). These datasets, including Pittsburgh (PIT; University of Pittsburgh, USA), NeuroCognitive Development (NCD; University of Oslo, Norway), and Orygen Adolescent Development Study (OADS; The University of Melbourne, Australia), span three countries and were analyzed together and in parallel using mixed-effects modeling with both generalized additive models and general linear models. For all regions and across all samples, males were found to have significantly larger volumes as compared to females, and significant sex differences were seen in age trajectories over time. However, direct comparison of sample trajectories and sex differences identified within samples were not consistent. The trajectories for the amygdala, putamen, and nucleus accumbens were most consistent between the three samples. Our results suggest that even after using similar preprocessing and analytic techniques, additional factors, such as image acquisition or sample composition may contribute to some of the discrepancies in sex specific patterns in subcortical brain changes across adolescence, and highlight region-specific variations in congruency of developmental trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Athletes regularly endure large increases in ventilation, and accompanying perceptions of breathlessness. While breathing perceptions often correlate poorly with objective measures of lung function in both health and clinical populations, we have previously demonstrated closer matching between subjective breathlessness and changes in ventilation in endurance athletes, suggesting that athletes may be more accurate during respiratory interoception. To better understand the link between exercise and breathlessness, we sought to identify the mechanisms by which the brain processing of respiratory perception might be optimised in athletes. Twenty endurance athletes and 20 sedentary controls underwent 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging. Inspiratory resistive loading induced conscious breathing perceptions (breathlessness), and a delay-conditioning paradigm was employed to evoke preceding periods of anticipation. Athletes demonstrated anticipatory brain activity that positively correlated with resulting breathing perceptions within key interoceptive areas, such as the thalamus, insula and primary sensorimotor cortices, which was negatively correlated in sedentary controls. Athletes also exhibited greater connectivity between interoceptive attention networks and primary sensorimotor cortex. These functional differences in athletic brains suggest that exercise may optimise processing of respiratory sensations. Future work may probe whether these brain mechanisms are harnessed when exercise is employed to treat breathlessness within chronic respiratory disease.",

    "abstract": "Parallel evolution of gene expression commonly underlies convergent niche specialization, but parallel changes in expression could also underlie divergent specialization. We investigated divergence in gene expression and whole-genome genetic variation across three sympatric Cyprinodon pupfishes endemic to San Salvador Island, Bahamas. This recent radiation consists of a generalist and two derived specialists adapted to novel niches - a  scale-eater and a  snail-eater. We sampled total mRNA from all three species at two early developmental stages and compared gene expression with whole-genome genetic differentiation among all three species in 42 resequenced genomes. 80% of genes that were differentially expressed between snail-eaters and generalists were up or downregulated in the same direction between scale-eaters and generalists; however, there were no fixed variants shared between species underlying these parallel changes in expression. Genes showing parallel evolution of expression were enriched for effects on metabolic processes, whereas genes showing divergent expression were enriched for effects on cranial skeleton development and pigment biosynthesis, reflecting the most divergent phenotypes observed between specialist species. Our findings reveal that even divergent niche specialists may exhibit convergent adaptation to higher trophic levels through shared genetic pathways. This counterintuitive result suggests that parallel evolution in gene expression can accompany divergent ecological speciation during adaptive radiation.\\n\\nImpact SummaryAdaptations that result in unique forms of ecological specialization are central to research in evolutionary biology, yet little is known about their molecular foundations. We combined transcriptome sequencing with whole-genome divergence scans to study the molecular evolution of two specialist Cyprinodon pupfish species - a  scale-eater and a  snail-eater - that rapidly diverged from a sympatric generalist ancestor within the last 10,000 years. While parallel evolution of gene expression driving convergent niche specialization seems common, we present, to our knowledge, the first example of significant parallel changes in expression coinciding with divergent niche specialization. 80% of genes that were differentially expressed between snail-eaters and generalists showed the same direction of expression in scale-eaters relative to generalists. Furthermore, parallel evolution in expression seem to be controlled by unique genetic variants in each specialist species. Genes showing parallel changes in expression were enriched for metabolic processes that may facilitate adaptation to a higher trophic level, while genes showing divergent expression likely shape the striking morphological differences between specialists. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of convergent adaptations that arise during speciation, and highlight how species can evolve similar expression profiles adapted to divergent niches.",

    "abstract": "Soil bacteria are key to ecosystem function and maintenance of soil fertility. Leveraging associations of current geographic distributions of bacteria with historic climate, we predict that soil bacterial diversity will increase across the majority (~75%) of the Tibetan Plateau and northern North America if bacterial communities equilibrate with existing climatic conditions. This prediction is possible because the current distributions of soil bacteria have stronger correlations with climate from ~50 years ago than with current climate. This lag is likely associated with the time it takes for soil properties to adjust to changes in climate. The predicted changes are location specific and differ across bacterial taxa, including some bacteria that are predicted to have reductions in their distributions. These findings demonstrate the widespread influence that climate change will have on belowground diversity and highlight the importance of considering bacterial communities when assessing climate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThere have been many studies highlighting how plant and animal communities lag behind climate change, causing extinction and diversity debts that will slowly be paid as communities equilibrate. By virtue of their short generation times and dispersal abilities, soil bacteria might be expected to respond to climate change quickly and to be effectively in equilibrium with current climatic conditions. We found strong evidence to the contrary in Tibet and North America. These findings could significantly improve understanding of climate impacts on soil microbial communities.",

To better understand how gametocytes differ from asexual blood-stage parasites, we performed a systematic analysis of available  omics data for P. falciparum and other Plasmodium species. 18 transcriptomic and proteomic data sets were evaluated for the presence of curated \\\"gold standards\\\" of 41 gametocyte-specific versus 46 non-gametocyte genes and integrated using Bayesian probabilities, resulting in gametocyte-specificity scores for all P. falciparum genes.\\n\\nTo illustrate the utility of the gametocyte score, we explored newly predicted gametocyte-specific genes as potential biomarkers of gametocyte carriage and exposure. We analyzed the humoral immune response in field samples against 30 novel gametocyte-specific antigens and found five antigens to be differentially recognized by gametocyte carriers as compared to malaria-infected individuals without detectable gametocytes. We also validated the gametocyte-specificity of 15 identified gametocyte transcripts on culture material and samples from naturally infected individuals, resulting in eight transcripts that were >1000-fold higher expressed in gametocytes compared to asexual parasites and whose transcript abundance allowed gametocyte detection in naturally infected individuals.

    "abstract": "Memory retrieval can strengthen, but also distort memories. Parietal cortex is a candidate region involved in retrieval-induced memory changes as it reflects retrieval success and represents retrieved content. Here, we conducted an fMRI experiment to test whether different forms of parietal reactivation predict distinct consequences of retrieval. Subjects studied associations between words and pictures of faces, scenes, or objects, and then repeatedly retrieved half of the pictures, reporting the vividness of the retrieved pictures ( retrieval practice). On the following day, subjects completed a recognition memory test for individual pictures. Critically, the test included lures highly similar to studied pictures. Behaviorally, retrieval practice increased both hit and false alarm rates to similar lures, confirming a causal influence of retrieval on subsequent memory. Using pattern similarity analyses, we measured two different levels of reactivation during retrieval practice: generic  category-level reactivation and idiosyncratic  item-level reactivation. Vivid remembering during retrieval practice was associated with stronger category- and item-level reactivation in parietal cortex. However, these measures differentially predicted subsequent recognition memory performance: whereas higher category-level reactivation tended to predict false alarms to lures, item-level reactivation predicted correct rejections. These findings indicate that parietal reactivation can be decomposed to tease apart distinct consequences of memory retrieval.",

Small samples or those whose RNA is degraded, such as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, remain challenging to study with nonspecialized RNA-seq protocols. Here we present a new method, Smart-3SEQ, that accurately quantifies transcript abundance even with small amounts of total RNA and effectively characterizes small samples extracted by laser-capture microdissection (LCM) from FFPE tissue. We also obtain distinct biological profiles from FFPE single cells, which have been impossible to study with previous RNA-seq protocols, and we use these data to identify possible new macrophage phenotypes associated with the tumor microenvironment. We propose Smart-3SEQ as a highly cost-effective method to enable large gene-expression profiling experiments unconstrained by sample size and tissue availability. In particular, Smart-3SEQs compatibility with FFPE tissue unlocks an enormous number of archived clinical samples, and combined with LCM it allows unprecedented studies of small cell populations and single cells isolated by their in situ context.",

Here we study the prickle gene and its protein products Prickle and Spiny leg. Much research on PCP has focused on the asymmetric localisation of core proteins in the cell and as a result prickle was placed in the heart of the Stan system. Here we ask if this view is correct and how the prickle gene relates to the two systems. We find that prickle can affect, separately, both systems -- however, neither Pk nor Sple are essential components of the Ds/Ft or the Stan system, nor do they act as a functional link between the two systems.",

    "abstract": "Whether mutations in bacteria exhibit a noticeable delay before expressing their corresponding mutant phenotype was discussed intensively in the 1940s-50s, but the discussion eventually waned for lack of supportive evidence and perceived incompatibility with observed mutant distributions in fluctuation tests. Phenotypic delay in bacteria is widely assumed to be negligible, despite lack of direct evidence. Here we revisited the question using recombineering to introduce antibiotic resistance mutations into E. coli at defined time points and then tracking expression of the corresponding mutant phenotype over time. Contrary to previous assumptions, we found a substantial median phenotypic delay of 3-4 generations. We provided evidence that the primary source of this delay is multifork replication causing cells to be effectively polyploid, whereby wild-type gene copies transiently mask the phenotype of recessive mutant gene copies in the same cell. Using modeling and simulation methods, we explored the consequences of effective polyploidy for mutation rate estimation by fluctuation tests and sequencing-based methods. For recessive mutations, despite the substantial phenotypic delay, the per-copyor per-genome mutation rate is accurately estimated. However, the per-cell rate cannot be estimated by existing methods. Finally, with a mathematical model, we showed that effective polyploidy increases the frequency of costly recessive mutations in the standing genetic variation, and thus their potential contribution to evolutionary adaptation, while drastically reducing the chance that de novo recessive mutations can rescue populations facing a harsh environmental change such as antibiotic treatment. Overall, we have identified phenotypic delay and effective polyploidy as previously overlooked but essential components in bacterial evolvability, including antibiotic resistance evolution.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWhat is the time delay between the occurrence of a genetic mutation in a bacterial cell and manifestation of its phenotypic effect? We show that antibiotic resistance mutations in E.coli show a remarkably long phenotypic delay of 3-4 bacterial generations. The primary underlying mechanism of this delay is effective polyploidy. In a polyploid cell with multiple chromosomes, once a mutation arises on one of the chromosomes, the presence of non-mutated, wild-type gene copies on other chromosomes may mask the phenotype of the mutation. One implication of this finding is that conventional methods to determine the mutation rates of bacteria do not detect polyploidy and thus underestimate their potential for adaptation. More generally, the effect that a new mutation may become useful only in the \\\"grand-children of the grand-children\\\" suggests that pre-existing mutations are more important for surviving sudden environmental catastrophe.",

    "abstract": "Alu elements are a highly successful family of primate-specific retrotransposons that have fundamentally shaped primate evolution, including the evolution of our own species. Alus play critical roles in the formation of neurological networks and the epigenetic regulation of biochemical processes throughout the central nervous system (CNS), and thus are hypothesized to have contributed to the origin of human cognition. Despite the positive aspects of Alus, deleterious Alu activity is associated with a number of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, neurological networks are potentially vulnerable to the epigenetic dysregulation of Alu elements operating across the suite of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes that are critical for both mitochondrial and CNS function. Here, we highlight the beneficial neurological aspects of Alu elements as well as their potential to cause disease by disrupting key cellular processes across the CNS. We identify at least 37 neurological and neurodegenerative disorders wherein deleterious Alu activity has been implicated as a contributing factor for the manifestation of disease and, for many of these disorders, this activity is operating on genes that are essential for proper mitochondrial function. We conclude that the epigenetic dysregulation of Alu elements can ultimately disrupt mitochondrial homeostasis within the CNS. This mechanism is a plausible source for the incipient neuronal stress that is consistently observed across a spectrum of sporadic neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.",

In this study we aimed to identify miRNAs and their downstream targets involved in regeneration of islet beta cells following partial pancreatectomy in mice.\\n\\nMethodsRNA from laser capture microdissected (LCM) islets of partially pancreatectomized and sham-operated mice were profiled with microarrays to identify putative miRNAs implicated in control of beta cell regeneration. Altered expression of selected miRNAs, including miR-132, was verified by RT-PCR. Potential targets of miR-132 were seleced through bioinformatic data mining. Predicted miR-132 targets were validated for their changed RNA and protein expression levels and signaling upon miR-132 knockdown or overexpression in MIN6 cells. The ability of miR-132 to foster beta cell proliferation in vivo was further assessed in pancreatectomized miR-132-/- and control mice.\\n\\nResultsPartial pancreatectomy significantly increased the number of BrdU+/insulin+ positive islet cells. Microarray profiling revealed 14 miRNAs, including miR-132 and -141, to be significantly upregulated in LCM islets of partially pancreatectomized compared to LCM islets of control mice. In the same comparison miR-760 was the only miRNA found to be downregulated. Changed expression of these miRNAs in islets of partially pancreatectomized mice was confirmed by RT-PCR only in the case of miR-132 and -141. Based on previous knowledge of its function, we chose to focus our attention on miR-132. Downregulation of miR-132 in MIN6 cells reduced proliferation while enhancing the expression of proapoptic genes, which was instead reduced in miR-132 overexpression MIN6 cells. Microarray profiling, RT-PCR and immunoblotting of miR-132 overexpressing MIN6 cells revealed their downregulated expression of Pten, with concomitant increased levels of pro-proliferative factors phospho-Akt and phospho-Creb as well as inactivation of pro-apoptotic Foxo3 via its phosphorylation. Finally, we show that regeneration of beta cells following partial pancreatectomy was reduced in miR-132-/- mice compared to control mice.\\n\\nConclusions/InterpretationsOur study provides compelling evidence for upregulation of miR-132 being critical for regeneration of mouse islet beta cells in vivo through downregulation of its target Pten. Hence, the miR-132/Pten/Akt/Foxo3 signaling pathway may represent a suitable target to enhance beta cell mass.\\n\\nResearch in ContextWhat is already known?\\n\\nO_LISeveral miRNAs, including miR-132, are known to regulate beta cell function and mass in several mouse models of diabetes db/db, ob/ob and high fat-diet.\\nC_LI\\n\\nWhat is the key question?\\n\\nO_LIWhich are miRNAs implicated in control of beta cell regeneration upon partial pancreatectomy and how?\\nC_LI\\n\\nWhat are the new findings?\\n\\nO_LImiR-132 is critical to promote regeneration of mouse beta cells in vivo following partial pancreatectomy\\nC_LIO_LIIn vitro studies in mouse MIN6 cells indicate that miR-132 fosters beta cell proliferation by down-regulating the expression of phosphatase Pten, thereby tilting the balance between anti-apoptotic factor Akt and pro-apoptotic factor Foxo3 activities towards proliferation through regulation of their phosphorylation.\\nC_LI\\n\\nHow might this impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?\\n\\nO_LIThese findings strengthen the rationale for targeting the expression of miR-132 to increase beta cell mass in vivo (type 2 diabetes) or ex-vivo (islet transplantation in type 1 diabetes) for the treatment of diabetes.\\nC_LI",

Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster exposed to looming stimuli in a confined arena either froze or fled. The probability of freezing versus fleeing was modulated by the flys walking speed at the time of threat, demonstrating that freeze/flee decisions were context dependent. We describe a pair of descending neurons crucially implicated in freezing. Genetic silencing of P9 descending neurons disrupted freezing yet did not prevent fleeing. Optogenetic activation of both P9 neurons induced running and freezing in a state-dependent manner. Our findings establish walking speed as a key factor in defensive response choices and reveal a pair of descending neurons as a critical component in the circuitry mediating selection and execution of freezing or fleeing behaviors.",

The strategy simplified and streamlined the process of next-generation sequencing (NGS) library construction by fixing the bridge sequences and barcoding primers. We also developed Hi-TOM (available at http://www.hi-tom.net/hi-tom/), an online tool to track the mutations with precise percentage. Analysis of the samples from rice, hexaploid wheat and human cells reveals that the Hi-TOM tool has high reliability and sensitivity in tracking various mutations, especially complex chimeric mutations that frequently induced by genome editing. Hi-TOM does not require specially design of barcode primers, cumbersome parameter configuration or additional data analysis. Thus, the streamlined NGS library construction and comprehensive result output make Hi-TOM particularly suitable for high-throughput identification of all types of mutations induced by CRISPR/Cas systems.",

Analysis typically proceeds considering the evidence for contacts between each possible pair of fragments independent from other pairs. This can produce long runs of fragments which appear to all make contact with the same baited fragment of interest. We hypothesised that these long runs could result from a smaller subset of direct contacts and propose a new method, based on a Bayesian sparse variable selection approach, which attempts to fine map these direct contacts.\\n\\nOur model is conceptually novel, exploiting the spatial pattern of counts in CHi-C data, and prioritises fragments with biological properties that would be expected of true contacts. For bait fragments corresponding to gene promoters, we identify contact fragments with active chromatin and contacts that correspond to edges found in previously defined enhancer-target networks; conversely, for intergenic bait fragments, we identify contact fragments corresponding to promoters for genes expressed in that cell type. We show that long runs of apparently co-contacting fragments can typically be explained using a subset of direct contacts consisting of < 10% of the number in the full run, suggesting that greater resolution can be extracted from existing datasets. Our results appear largely complementary to the those from a per-fragment analytical approach, suggesting that they provide an additional level of interpretation that may be used to increase resolution for mapping direct contacts in CHi-C experiments.",

Loss of this circadian oscillation pattern during stress and disease correlates with increased fat mass and obesity in humans, raising the intriguing question of how hormone secretion dynamics affect the process of adipocyte differentiation. By using live, single-cell imaging of the key adipogenic transcription factors CEBPB and PPARG, endogenously tagged with fluorescent proteins, we show that pulsatile circadian hormone stimuli are rejected by the adipocyte differentiation control system, leading to very low adipocyte differentiation rates. In striking contrast, equally strong persistent signals trigger maximal differentiation. We identify the mechanism of how hormone oscillations are filtered as a combination of slow and fast positive feedback centered on PPARG. Furthermore, we confirm in mice that flattening of daily glucocorticoid oscillations significantly increases the mass of subcutaneous and visceral fat pads. Together, our study provides a molecular mechanism for why stress, Cushings disease, and other conditions for which glucocorticoid secretion loses its pulsatility can lead to obesity.

    "abstract": "Corrected version -This version can be cited. RNA granules are dynamic sub-cellular compartments that lack enveloping membranes. RNA granules have been proposed to form by liquid-liquid phase separation, a thermodynamic process that partitions molecules between dilute and condensed liquid phases 1. P granules are archetypal RNA granules in C. elegans that display liquid-like behaviors 2. Here we describe in vivo and ex vivo approaches to analyze the material properties of P granules. We find that the liquid phase of P granules is stabilized by a molecularly-distinct, enveloping shell that is intrinsically non-dynamic. Consistent with a gel phase, the shell is resistant to dilution, high salt, and aliphatic alcohols, and dissolves in SDS. Solidification of RNA granules has been linked to neuronal degeneration 3. Our findings suggest that gel-like polymers are essential components of RNA granules that help stabilize liquid phases in the cellular environment.",

However, it remains difficult to detect rare and common cell types at the same time. Here we present a new computational method, called GiniClust2, to overcome this challenge. GiniClust2 combines the strengths of two complementary approaches, using the Gini index and Fano factor, respectively, through a cluster-aware, weighted ensemble clustering technique. GiniClust2 successfully identifies both common and rare cell types in diverse datasets, outperforming existing methods. GiniClust2 is scalable to very large datasets.",

    "abstract": "Invariant object recognition, which refers to the ability of precisely and rapidly recognizing objects in the presence of variations, has been a central question in human vision research. The general consensus is that the ventral and dorsal visual streams are the major processing pathways which undertake category and variation encoding in entangled layers. This overlooks the mounting evidence which support the role of peri-frontal areas in category encoding. These recent studies, however, have left open several aspects of visual processing in peri-frontal areas including whether these areas contributed only in active tasks, whether they interacted with peri-occipital areas or processed information independently and differently. To address these concerns, a passive EEG paradigm was designed in which subjects viewed a set of variation-controlled object images. Using multivariate pattern analysis, noticeable category and variation information were observed in occipital, parietal, temporal and prefrontal areas, supporting their contribution to visual processing. Using task specificity indices, phase and Granger causality analyses, three distinct stages of processing were identified which revealed transfer of information between peri-frontal and peri-occipital areas suggesting their parallel and interactive processing of visual information. A brain-plausible computational model supported the possibility of parallel processing mechanisms in peri-occipital and peri-frontal areas. These findings, while advocating previous results on the role of prefrontal areas in object recognition, extend their contribution from active recognition, in which peri-frontal to peri-occipital feedback mechanisms are activated, to the general case of object and variation processing, which is an integral part of visual processing and play role even during passive viewing.",

However, semi-naturalistic monkey interactions within lab settings have not been well characterized. We here analyze \\\"minimal interactions\\\" between monkeys in the laboratory. Monkeys, like humans, produce a variety of facial expressions when they encounter one another. It has been unclear what specific information they use to guide their behavior. I recorded the facial signals of captive long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) while they visually interacted while seated in primate chairs. I found that the most consistently-evoked expressions were affiliative in character, most notably in the form of reciprocal lipsmacking. Consistent with prior experiments, lipsmacks were most evident when situational and social ambiguity was maximal: that is, in the first sessions, in the first moments of each session, and when interacting with unfamiliar individuals. Unexpectedly, head and eye orientation played dissociable roles in interactive behaviors. Most intriguingly, monkeys facial behaviors reflected both received and previously sent signals, suggesting they interpret others current signals in light of their own past communications.",

However, whether and how these two epithelial attributes are connected in vivo is largely unknown. We herein report that conditional genetic deletion of E-cadherin, a key component of adherens junctions, in a mouse model results in loss of prostate luminal cell polarity and randomization of spindle orientations. Critically, E-cadherin ablation causes prostatic hyperplasia which progresses to invasive adenocarcinoma. Mechanistically, E-cadherin and the spindle positioning determinant LGN interacts with the PDZ domain of cell polarity protein SCRIB and form a ternary protein complex to bridge cell polarity and cell division orientation. These findings provide a novel mechanism by which E-cadherin acts an anchor to maintain prostate epithelial integrity and to prevent carcinogenesis in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Parasitic chytrid fungi have emerged as a significant threat to amphibian species worldwide, necessitating the development of techniques to isolate these pathogens into sterile culture for research purposes. However, early methods of isolating chytrids from their hosts relied on killing amphibians. We modified a pre-existing protocol for isolating chytrids from infected animals to use toe clips and biopsies from toe webbing rather than euthanizing hosts, and distributed the protocol to interested researchers worldwide as part of the BiodivERsA project RACE - here called the RML protocol. In tandem, we developed a lethal procedure for isolating chytrids from tadpole mouthparts. Reviewing a database of use a decade after their inception, we find that these methods have been widely applied across at least 5 continents, 23 countries and in 62 amphibian species, and have been successfully used to isolate chytrids in remote field locations. Isolation of chytrids by the non-lethal RML protocol occured in 18% of attempts with 207 fungal isolates and three species of chytrid being recovered. Isolation of chytrids from tadpoles occured in 43% of attempts with 334 fungal isolates of one species (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) being recovered. Together, these methods have resulted in a significant reduction and refinement of our use of threatened amphibian species and have improved our ability to work with this important group of emerging fungal pathogens.",

A core set of diverse B. distachyon diploid lines were selected for whole genome sequencing and high resolution phenotyping.

    "abstract": "Malarial dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (DPAPs) are cysteine proteases important for parasite development thus making them attractive drug targets. In order to develop inhibitors specific to the parasite enzymes it is necessary to map the determinants of substrate specificity of the parasite enzymes and its mammalian homologue cathepsin C (CatC). Here, we screened peptide-based libraries of substrates and covalent inhibitors to characterize the differences in specificity between parasite DPAPs and CatC, and used this information to develop highly selective DPAP1 and DPAP3 inhibitors. Interestingly, while the primary amino acid specificity of a protease is often used to develop potent inhibitors, we show that equally potent and highly specific inhibitors can be developed based on the sequences of non-optimal peptide substrates. Importantly, analysis of previously published data about the specificity of other proteases also unveiled significant discrepancies in the amino acid preference between substrates and inhibitors. In this article, we also discuss important structural and theoretical reasons that might account for these discrepancies. Overall, this study illustrates that focusing the development of protease inhibitors solely on substrate specificity might overlook important structural features that can be exploited to develop highly potent and selective compounds.",

Recently, lysosomes and chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA) has been reported to participate in the degradation of DJ-1/PARK7 protein. Lamp-2A isoform is considered as the lysosomal receptor for the uptake of proteins being degraded by the CMA pathway. We have used several cell lines with disrupted LAMP2 gene expression and their respective control cells to test the possible role of lysosomal degradation and in particular CMA in DJ-1 /PARK7 degradation. Interruption of LAMP-2 expression did not result in an increase of the steady-state protein levels of DJ-1 /PARK7, as it would have been expected. Furthermore, no change in DJ-1 /PARK7 protein levels were observed upon inhibition of lysosomal function with NH4Cl or NH4Cl plus leupeptin, or after activation of CMA by serum starvation for 24h. Accordingly, we have not found any evidence that DJ-1 /PARK7 protein levels are regulated via lysosomal degradation or the CMA pathway.",

Here we developed a Apache Spark-based scalable sequence clustering application, SparkReadClust (SpaRC), that partitions the reads based on their molecule of origin to enable downstream assembly optimization. SpaRC produces high clustering performance on transcriptomics and metagenomics test datasets from both short read and long read sequencing technologies. It achieved a near linear scalability with respect to input data size and number of compute nodes. SpaRC can run on different cloud computing environments without modifications while delivering similar performance.

    "abstract": "Immune heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment undoubtedly adds several layers of complexity to our understanding of drug sensitivity and patient prognosis across various cancer types. Within the tumor microenvironment, immunogenicity is a favorable clinical feature in part driven by the antitumor activity of CD8+ T cells. However, tumors often inhibit this antitumor activity by exploiting the suppressive function of Regulatory T cells (Tregs), thus suppressing the adaptive immune response. Despite the seemingly intuitive immunosuppressive biology of Tregs, prognostic studies have produced contradictory results regarding the relationship between Treg enrichment and survival. We therefore analyzed RNA-seq data of Treg-enriched tumor samples to derive a pan-cancer gene signature able to help reconcile the inconsistent results of Treg studies, by better understanding the variable clinical association of Tregs across alternative tumor contexts. We show that increased expression of a 32-gene signature in Treg-enriched tumor samples (n=135) is able to distinguish a cohort of patients associated with chemosensitivity and overall survival This cohort is also enriched for CD8+ T cell abundance, as well as the antitumor M1 macrophage subtype. With a subsequent validation in a larger TCGA pool of Treg-enriched patients (n = 626), our results reveal a gene signature able to produce unsupervised clusters of Treg-enriched patients, with one cluster of patients uniquely representative of an immunogenic tumor microenvironment. Ultimately, these results support the proposed gene signature as a putative biomarker to identify certain Treg-enriched patients with immunogenic tumors that are more likely to be associated with features of favorable clinical outcome.",

Yet, even for the well-studied model bacterium Escherichia coli, many basic questions remain unresolved regarding chromosomal (sub-)structure2,11, its mechanics1,2,12 and dynamics13,14, and the link between structure and function1,15,16. Here we resolve the spatial organization of the circular chromosome of bacteria by directly imaging the chromosome in live E. coli cells with a broadened cell shape. The chromosome was observed to exhibit a torus topology with a 4.2 m toroidal length and 0.4 m bundle thickness. On average, the DNA density along the chromosome shows dense right and left arms that branch from a lower-density origin of replication, and are connected at the terminus of replication by an ultrathin flexible string of DNA. At the single-cell level, the DNA density along the torus is found to be strikingly heterogeneous, with blob-like Mbp-size domains that undergo major dynamic rearrangements, splitting and merging at a minute timescale. We show that prominent domain boundaries at the terminus and origin of replication are induced by MatP proteins, while weaker transient domain boundaries are facilitated by the global transcription regulators HU and Fis. These findings provide an architectural basis for the understanding of the spatial organization of bacterial genomes.",

The present study employs an unsupervised data-driven method to identify spatial patterns of tau-PET distribution, and to compare these patterns to previously published \\\"pathology-driven\\\" ROIs. Tau-PET patterns were identified from a discovery sample comprised of 123 normal controls and patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimers disease (AD) dementia from the Swedish BioFINDER cohort, who underwent [18F]AV1451 PET scanning. Associations with cognition were tested in a separate sample of 90 individuals from ADNI. BioFINDER [18F]AV1451 images were entered into a robust voxelwise stable clustering algorithm, which resulted in five clusters. Mean [18F]AV1451 uptake in the data-driven clusters, and in 35 previously published pathology-driven ROIs, was extracted from ADNI [18F]AV1451 scans. We performed linear models comparing [18F]AV1451 signal across all 40 ROIs to several tests of global cognition, adjusting for age, sex and education. Two data-driven ROIs consistently demonstrated the strongest or near-strongest effect sizes across all cognitive tests. Inputting all regions plus demographics into a feature selection routine resulted in selection of two ROIs (one data-driven, one pathology-driven) and education, which together explained 28% of the variance of a global cognitive composite score. Our findings suggest that [18F]AV1451-PET data naturally clusters into spatial patterns that are biologically meaningful and that may offer advantages as clinical tools.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOxidative stress has been linked to heart failure (HF) in humans. Antioxidant-based treatments are often ineffective. Therefore, we hypothesize that some of the HF patients might have a reductive stress (RS) condition. Investigating RS-related mechanisms will aid in personalized optimization of redox homeostasis for better outcomes among HF patients.\\n\\nMethodsBlood samples were collected from HF patients (n=54) and healthy controls (n=42) and serum was immediately preserved in -80{degrees}C for redox analysis. Malondialdehyde (MDA; lipid peroxidation) levels by HPLC, reduced glutathione (GSH) and its redox ratio (GSH/GSSG) using enzymatic-recycling assay in the serum of HF patients were measured. Further, the kinetics of key enzymatic-antioxidant enzymes was analyzed by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Non-invasive echocardiography was used to relate circulating redox status with cardiac function and remodeling.\\n\\nResultsThe circulatory redox state (GSH/MDA ratio) was used to stratify the HF patients into normal redox (NR), hyper-oxidative (HO), and hyper-reductive (HR) groups. While the majority of the HF patients exhibited the HO (42%), 41% of them had a normal redox (NR) state. Surprisingly, a subset of HF patients (17%) belonged to the hyper-reductive group, suggesting a strong implication for RS in the progression of HF. In HF patients, SOD, GPx and catalase were significantly increased while GR activity was significantly reduced relative to healthy controls. Furthermore, echocardiography analyses revealed that 55% of HO patients had higher systolic dysfunction while 75% of the hyper-reductive patients had higher diastolic dysfunction.\\n\\nConclusionThese results suggest that RS may be associated with HF pathogenesis for a subset of cardiac patients. Thus, stratification of HF patients based on their circulating redox status may serve as a useful prognostic tool to guide clinicians designing personalized antioxidant therapies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSuper-resolution single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is a method for achieving resolution beyond the classical limit in optical microscopes (approx. 200 nm laterally). Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) has been used for super-resolution single molecule localization microscopy, but less frequently than other fluorescent probes. Working with YFP in SMLM is a challenge because a lower number of photons are emitted per molecule compared to organic dyes which are more commonly used. Publically available experimental data can facilitate development of new data analysis algorithms.\\n\\nFindingsFour complete, freely available single molecule super-resolution microscopy datasets on YFP-tagged growth factor receptors expressed in a human cell line are presented including both raw and analyzed data. We report methods for sample preparation, for data acquisition, and for data analysis, as well as examples of the acquired images. We also analyzed the SMLM data sets using a different method: super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI). The two modes of analysis offer complementary information about the sample. A fifth single molecule super-resolution microscopy dataset acquired with the dye Alexa 532 is included for comparison purposes.\\n\\nConclusionThis dataset has potential for extensive reuse. Complete raw data from SMLM experiments has typically not been published. The YFP data exhibits low signal to noise ratios, making data analysis a challenge. These data sets will be useful to investigators developing their own algorithms for SMLM, SOFI, and related methods.

    "abstract": "RNA-protein 3D complex structure prediction is still challenging. Recently, a template-based approach PRIME is proposed in our team to build RNA-protein complex 3D structure models with a higher success rate than computational docking software. However, scoring function of RNA alignment algorithm SARA in PRIME is size-dependent, which limits its ability to detect templates in some cases. Herein, we developed a novel RNA 3D structural alignment approach RMalign, which is based on a size-independent scoring function RMscore. The parameter in RMscore is then optimized in randomly selected RNA pairs and phase transition points (from dissimilar to similar) are determined in another randomly selected RNA pairs. In tRNA benchmarking, the precision of RMscore is higher than that of SARAscore (0.8771 and 0.7766, respectively) with phase transition points. In balance-FSCOR benchmarking, RMalign performed as good as ESA-RNA with a non-normalized score measuring RNA structure similarity. In balance-x-FSCOR benchmarking, RMalign achieves much better than a state-of-the-art RNA 3D structural alignment approach SARA due to a size-independent scoring function. Taking the advantage of RMalign, we update our RNA-protein modeling approach PRIME to version 2.0. The PRIME2.0 significantly improves about 10% success rate than PRIME.\\n\\nAuthor summaryRNA structures are important for RNA functions. With the increasing of RNA structures in PDB, RNA 3D structure alignment approaches have been developed. However, the scoring function which is used for measuring RNA structural similarity is still length dependent. This shortcoming limits its ability to detect RNA structure templates in modeling RNA structure or RNA-protein 3D complex structure. Thus, we developed a length independent scoring function RMscore to enhance the ability to detect RNA structure homologs. The benchmarking data shows that RMscore can distinct the similar and dissimilar RNA structure effectively. RMscore should be a useful scoring function in modeling RNA structures for the biological community. Based on RMscore, we develop an RNA 3D structure alignment RMalign. In both RNA structure and function classification benchmarking, RMalign obtains as good as or even better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches. With a length independent scoring function RMscore, RMalign should be useful for the modeling RNA structures. Based on above results, we update PRIME to PRIME2.0. We provide a more accurate RNA-protein 3D complex structure modeling tool PRIME2.0 which should be useful for the biological community.",

However, the screening outcome is biased in amplified genomic regions, due to the ability of the Cas9 nuclease to induce multiple double-stranded breaks and strong DNA damage responses at these regions. We developed algorithms to correct biases associated with copy number variations (CNV), even when the CNV profiles are unknown. We demonstrated that our methods effectively reduced false positives in amplified regions while preserving signals of true positives. In addition, we developed a sliding window approach to estimate regions of high copy numbers for cases in which CNV information is not available. These copy number estimations can subsequently be used to effectively correct CNV-related biases in CRISPR screening experiments. Our approach is integrated into the existing MAGeCK/MAGeCK-VISPR analysis pipelines and provides a convenient framework to improve the precision of CRISPR screening results.",

    "abstract": "T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive malignancy of thymocytes. The role of thymic microenvironmental cells and stromal factors in thymocyte malignant transformation and T-ALL development remains little explored. Here, using the TEL-JAK2 transgenic (TJ2-Tg) mouse model of T-ALL, which is driven by constitutive JAK/STAT signaling and characterized by the acquisition of Notch1 mutations, we sought to identify stromal cell alterations associated with thymic leukemogenesis. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that thymic lymphomas presented epithelial areas characterized by keratin 5 and keratin 8 expression, adjacently to keratin-negative, epithelial-free areas. Both keratin-positive and -negative areas stained conspicuously with ER-TR7 (a fibroblast marker), laminin, and CD31 (an endothelial cell marker). Besides keratin 5, keratin-positive areas were also labeled by the Ulex Europaeus agglutinin-1 medullary thymic epithelial cell (TEC) marker. To assess whether TECs are important for T-ALL development, we generated TJ2-Tg mice heterozygous for the FoxN1 transcription factor nude null mutation. In contrast to nude homozygous mice, which lack thymus and thymocytes, heterozygous mutant mice present only mild thymocyte maturation defects. In TJ2-Tg;Foxn1+/nu compound mice both emergence of malignant cells in pre-leukemic thymi and overt T-ALL onset were significantly delayed. Moreover, in transplantation assays leukemic cell expansion in the thymus of recipient Foxn1+/nu mice was reduced as compared to control littermates. These results indicate that FoxN1 insufficiency impairs specifically thymic leukemogenesis but not thymocyte development.\\n\\nSummaryIn a mouse model of T-ALL, several cellular alterations were detected in thymic lymphomas, including altered epithelial distribution and increased proportion of fibroblasts or endothelial cells. Reduced dosage of FoxN1, a thymic epithelial transcription factor, delayed leukemogenesis in these mice.",

We quantify jaw mechanical advantage between the sexes of both species to track changes in velocity and force transmission associated with the development of sexual weaponry. We find evidence for trade-offs between skull shape and mechanical advantage in C. samueli, where males with longer faces exhibit lower mechanical advantages, suggesting weaker bite forces.

In this study, we systematically analyzed skeletal phenotypes in a large set of zebrafish, with diverse mutations in the genes encoding type I collagen, representing different genetic forms of human OI, and the first zebrafish model of human EDS, which harbors characteristic defects in the soft connective tissues.

Inherent to these disorders is a large clinical variability, of which the underlying molecular basis remains undefined. By systematically analyzing skeletal phenotypes in a large set of type I collagen zebrafish mutants we show that zebrafish models are able to both genocopy and phenocopy different forms of human type I collagenopathies, arguing for a similar pathogenetic basis.

    "abstract": "To comprehensively study extracellular small RNAs (sRNA) by sequencing (sRNA-seq), we developed a novel pipeline to overcome current limitations in analysis entitled, \\\"Tools for Integrative Genome analysis of Extracellular sRNAs (TIGER)\\\". To demonstrate the power of this tool, sRNA-seq was performed on mouse lipoproteins, bile, urine, and liver samples. A key advance for the TIGER pipeline is the ability to analyze both host and non-host sRNAs at genomic, parent RNA, and individual fragment levels. TIGER was able to identify approximately 60% of sRNAs on lipoproteins, and >85% of sRNAs in liver, bile, and urine, a significant advance compared to existing software. Results suggest that the majority of sRNAs on lipoproteins are non-host sRNAs derived from bacterial sources in the microbiome and environment, specifically rRNA-derived sRNAs from Proteobacteria. Collectively, TIGER facilitated novel discoveries of lipoprotein and biofluid sRNAs and has tremendous applicability for the field of extracellular RNA.",

To better map transcription genome-wide at base pair resolution and with transcription/elongation factor dependency we developed an adapted NET-seq protocol called NET-prism (Native Elongating Transcription by Polymerase-Regulated Immunoprecipitants in the Mammalian genome). NET-prism introduces an immunoprecipitation to capture RNA Pol II - associated proteins, which reveals the interaction of these proteins with active RNA Pol II. Application of NET-prism on different Pol II subunits (Pol II S2ph, Pol II S5ph), elongation factors (Spt6, Ssrp1), and components of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) (TFIID, TBP, and Mediator) reveals diverse Pol II signals, at a single nucleotide resolution, with regards to directionality and intensity over promoters, splice sites, and enhancers/super-enhancers. NET-prism will be broadly applicable as it exposes transcription factor/Pol II dependent topographic specificity and thus, a new degree of regulatory complexity.",

    "abstract": "To infer brain source activation patterns under different cognitive tasks is an integral step to understand how our brain works. Traditional electroencephalogram (EEG) Source Imaging (ESI) methods usually do not distinguish task-related and spurious non-task-related sources that jointly generate EEG signals, which inevitably yield misleading reconstructed activation patterns. In this research, we argue that the task-related source signal intrinsically has a low-rank property, which is exploited to to infer the true task-related EEG sources location. Although the true task-related source signal is sparse and low-rank, the contribution of spurious sources scattering over the source space with intermittent activation patterns makes the actual source space lose the low-rank property. To reconstruct a low-rank true source, we propose a novel ESI model that involves a spatial low-rank representation and a temporal Laplacian graph regularization, the latter of which guarantees the temporal smoothness of the source signal and eliminate the spurious ones. To solve the proposed model, an augmented Lagrangian objective function is formulated and an algorithm in the framework of alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of reconstruction accuracy with high effciency.",

    "abstract": "Pertussis has resurged in many countries where it was once regarded as under control, with the recent outbreaks showing a shift in incidence towards teens and older individuals. Here, using an age-stratified transmission model, we tested two potential causes for underlying changes in pertussis transmission dynamics. We did so assuming hypothesized mechanisms supporting present-day pertussis epidemiology: (I) improved diagnostics, (II) acellular vaccines leading to asymptomatic transmission (III) both. We used the relative risks and odds ratio methods to examine the impact of these differing assumptions on signatures of relative roles of key age groups through time, allowing us to explore those age cohorts that disproportionately account for transmission. Our findings show that for epidemics after the vaccine switch, a scenario with increased adult reporting and no asymptomatic transmission reflect a loss of signal, where no age group appears to be key. While scenarios with asymptomatic transmission, reflect a population where children (1-10 years old) are still disproportionally at risk. These results demonstrate that understanding the underlying transmission mechanisms in a population are paramount for vaccination policies in attaining herd immunity and eventually eradication.",

Logistic regression was used to estimate associations between UUI and earlier life vascular risk factors including: lipid status, diabetes, hypertension, body mass index (BMI), previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) diagnosis; adjusting for smoking status, physical activity, co-presentation of SUI symptoms, educational attainment and in women only, type of menopause, age at period cessation and use of hormone replacement therapy.\\n\\nResultsUUI was reported by 12% of men and 19% of women at 68. Female sex, previous stroke or TIA diagnosis, increased BMI and hypertension (in men only) at age 60-64 were independent risk factors for UUI. Female sex, increased BMI and a previous diagnosis of stroke/ TIA increased the relative risk of more severe UUI symptoms. Type and timing of menopause and HRT use did not alter the estimated associations between UUI and vascular risk factors in women.\\n\\nConclusionMultifactorial mechanisms lead to UUI and vascular risk factors may contribute to pathogenesis of bladder overactivity in addition to higher BMI.

    "abstract": "SynopsisA procedure for optimizing the sharpening of a map based on maximizing the level of detail and connectivity of the map is developed and applied to 361 pairs of deposited cryo-EM maps and associated models.\\n\\nAbstractWe present an algorithm for automatic map sharpening that is based on optimization of detail and connectivity of the sharpened map. The detail in the map is reflected in the surface area of an iso-contour surface that contains a fixed fraction of the volume of the map, where a map with high level of detail has a high surface area. The connectivity of the sharpened map is reflected in the number of connected regions defined by the same iso-contour surfaces, where a map with high connectivity has a small number of connected regions. By combining these two measures in a metric we term \\\"adjusted surface area\\\", we can evaluate map quality in an automated fashion. We use this metric to choose optimal map sharpening parameters without reference to a model or other interpretations of the map. Map sharpening by optimization of adjusted surface area can be carried out for a map as a whole or it can be carried out locally, yielding a locally-sharpened map. To evaluate the performance of various approaches, we use a simple metric based on map-model correlation that can reproduce visual choices of optimally-sharpened maps. The map-model correlation is calculated using a model with B-factors (atomic displacement factors, ADP) set to zero. We use this model-based metric to evaluate map sharpening, use it to evaluate map sharpening approaches and find that optimization of adjusted surface area can be an effective tool for map sharpening.",

Although numerous computational tools have been developed to analyze single cell transcriptomes, there are no published studies and analytical packages available to guide experimental design and to devise suitable analysis procedure for cell type identification.\\n\\nResultsWe have developed an empirical methodology to address this important gap in single cell experimental design and analysis into an easy-to-use tool called SCEED (Single Cell Empirical Experimental Design and analysis). With SCEED, user can choose a variety of combinations of tools for analysis, conduct performance analysis of analytical procedures and choose the best procedure, and estimate sample size (number of cells to be profiled) required for a given analytical procedure at varying levels of cell type rarity and other experimental parameters. Using SCEED, we examined 3 single cell algorithms using 48 simulated single cell datasets that were generated for varying number of cell types and their proportions, number of genes expressed per cell, number of marker genes and their fold change, and number of single cells successfully profiled in the experiment.\\n\\nConclusionsBased on our study, we found that when marker genes are expressed at fold change of 4 or more than the rest of the genes, either Seurat or Simlr algorithm can be used to analyze single cell dataset for any number of single cells isolated (minimum 1000 single cells were tested). However, when marker genes are expected to be only up to fC 2 upregulated, choice of the single cell algorithm is dependent on the number of single cells isolated and proportion of rare cell type to be identified. In conclusion, our work allows the assessment of various single cell methods and also aids in examining the single cell experimental design.",

    "abstract": "Variance in reproductive success is a major determinant of the degree of genetic drift in a population. While many plants and animals exhibit high variance in their number of progeny, far less is known about these distributions for microorganisms. Here, we used a strain barcoding approach to quantify variability in offspring number among replicate bacterial populations and developed a Bayesian method to infer the distribution of descendants from this variability. We applied our approach to measure the offspring distributions for 5 strains of bacteria from the genus Streptomyces after germination and growth in a homogenous laboratory environment. The distributions of descendants were heavy-tailed, with a few cells effectively \\\"winning the jackpot\\\" to become a disproportionately large fraction of the population. This extreme variability in reproductive success largely traced back to initial populations of spores stochastically exiting dormancy, which provided early-germinating spores with an exponential advantage. In simulations with multiple dormancy cycles, heavy-tailed distributions of descendants decreased the effective population size by many orders of magnitude and led to allele dynamics differing substantially from classical population genetics models with matching effective population size. Collectively, these results demonstrate that extreme variability in reproductive success can occur even in growth conditions that are far more homogeneous than the natural environment. Thus, extreme variability in reproductive success might be an important factor shaping microbial population dynamics with implications for predicting the fate of beneficial mutations, interpreting sequence variability within populations, and explaining variability in infection outcomes across patients.",

Here we introduce an efficient way to produce three major blood cell types using a standardized differentiation protocol that starts with a single hematopoietic initiation step. This system is feeder-free, avoids EB-formation, starts with a hematopoietic initiation step based on a novel single cell-derived iPSC colony differentiation and produces multi-potential progenitors within 8-10 days. Followed by lineage-specific growth factor supplementation these cells can be matured into well characterized erythroid, megakaryoid and myeloid cells with high-purity, without transcription factor overexpression or any kind of pre-purification step.

While previous work has shown that adaptive alleles can be detected by comparing frequency trajectories from many replicate populations, this power comes at the expense of high-coverage (>100x) sequencing of many pooled samples, which can be cost-prohibitive. Here, we show that accurate estimates of allele frequencies can be achieved with very shallow sequencing depths (<5x) via inference of known founder haplotypes in small genomic windows. This technique can be used to efficiently estimate frequencies for any number of bi-allelic SNPs in populations of any model organism founded with sequenced homozygous strains. Using both experimentally-pooled and simulated samples of Drosophila melanogaster, we show that haplotype inference can improve allele frequency accuracy by orders of magnitude for up to 50 generations of recombination, and is robust to moderate levels of missing data, as well as different selection regimes. Finally, we show that a simple linear model generated from these simulations can predict the accuracy of haplotype-derived allele frequencies in other model organisms and experimental designs. To make these results broadly accessible for use in E+R experiments, we introduce HAF-pipe, an open-source software tool for calculating haplotype-derived allele frequencies from raw sequencing data. Ultimately, by reducing sequencing costs without sacrificing accuracy, our method facilitates E+R designs with higher replication and resolution, and thereby, increased power to detect adaptive alleles.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSynteny analysis is a valuable approach for understanding eukaryotic gene and genome evolution, but still relies largely on pairwise or reference-based comparisons. Network approaches can be utilized to expand large-scale phylogenomic microsynteny studies. There is now a wealth of completed mammalian (animal) and angiosperm (plant) genomes, two very important lineages that have evolved and radiated over the last ~170 million years. Genomic organization and conservation differs greatly between these two groups; however, a systematic and comparative characterization of synteny between the two lineages using the same approaches and metrics has not been undertaken.\\n\\nResultsWe have built complete microsynteny networks for 87 mammalian and 107 angiosperm genomes, which contain 1,464,753 nodes (genes) and 49,426,268 edges (syntenic connections between genes) for mammals, and 2,234,461 nodes and 46,938,272 edges for angiosperms, respectively. Exploiting network statistics, we present the functional characteristics of extremely conserved and diversified gene families. We summarize the features of all syntenic gene clusters and present lineage-wide phylogenetic profiling, revealing intriguing sub-clade lineage-specific clusters. We depict several representative clusters of important developmental genes in humans, such as CENPJ, p53 and NFE2. Finally, we present the complete homeobox gene family networks for both mammals (including Hox and ParaHox gene clusters) and angiosperms.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results illustrate and quantify overall synteny conservation and diversification properties of all annotated genes for mammals and angiosperms and show that plant genomes are in general more dynamic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAphids are a diverse group of taxa that contain hundreds of agronomically important species, which vary in their host range and pathogenicity. However, the genome evolution underlying agriculturally important aphid traits is not well understood.\\n\\nResultsWe generated highly-contiguous draft genome assemblies for two aphid species: the narrow host range Myzus cerasi, and the cereal specialist Rhopalosiphum padi. Using a de novo gene prediction pipeline on both these genome assemblies, and those of three related species (Acyrthosiphon pisum, D. noxia and M. persicae), we show that aphid genomes consistently encode similar gene numbers, and in the case of A. pisum, fewer and larger genes than previously reported. We compare gene content, gene duplication, synteny, horizontal gene transfer events, and putative effector repertoires between these five species to understand the genome evolution of globally important plant parasites.\\n\\nAphid genomes show signs of relatively distant gene duplication, and substantial, relatively recent, gene birth, and are characterized by disparate gain and loss of genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Such HGT events account for approximately 1% of loci, and contribute to the protein-coding content of aphid species analysed. Putative effector repertoires, originating from duplicated loci, putative HGT events and other loci, have an unusual genomic organisation and evolutionary history. We identify a highly conserved effector-pair that is tightly genetically-linked in all aphid species. In R. padi, this effector pair is tightly transcriptionally-linked, and shares a transcriptional control mechanism with a subset of approximately 50 other putative effectors distributed across the genome.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study extends our current knowledge on the evolution of aphid genomes and reveals evidence for a shared control mechanism, which underlies effector expression, and ultimately plant parasitism.",

    "abstract": "Powdery mildews are biotrophic pathogenic fungi infecting a number of economically important plants. The grass powdery mildew, Blumeria graminis, has become a model organism to study host specialization of obligate biotrophic fungal pathogens. We resolved the large-scale genomic architecture of B. graminis forma specialis hordei (Bgh) to explore the potential influence of its genome organization on the co-evolutionary process with its host plant, barley (Hordeum vulgare). The near-chromosome level assemblies of the Bgh reference isolate DH14 and one of the most diversified isolates, RACE1, enabled a comparative analysis of these haploid genomes, which are highly enriched with transposable elements (TEs). We found largely retained genome synteny and gene repertoires, yet detected copy number variation (CNV) of secretion signal peptide-containing protein-coding genes (SPs) and locally disrupted synteny blocks. Genes coding for sequence-related SPs are often locally clustered, but neither the SP clusters nor TEs are enriched in specific genomic regions. Extended comparative analysis with different host-specific B. graminis formae speciales revealed the existence of a core suite of SPs, but also isolate-specific SP sets as well as congruence of SP CNV and phylogenetic relationship. We further detected evidence for a recent, lineage-specific expansion of TEs in the Bgh genome. The characteristics of the Bgh genome (largely retained synteny, CNV of SP genes, recently proliferated TEs and a lack of compartmentalization) are consistent with a \\\"one-speed\\\" genome that differs in its architecture and (co-)evolutionary pattern from the \\\"two-speed\\\" genomes reported for several other filamentous phytopathogens.",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common congenital infection worldwide, frequently causing hearing loss and brain damage in afflicted infants. A vaccine to prevent maternal acquisition of HCMV during pregnancy is necessary to reduce the incidence of infant disease. The glycoprotein B (gB) + MF59 adjuvant subunit vaccine platform is the most successful HCMV vaccine tested to-date, demonstrating approximately 50% efficacy in preventing HCMV acquisition in phase II trials. However, the mechanism of vaccine protection remains unknown. Plasma from 33 gB/MF59 vaccinees at peak immunogenicity was tested for gB epitope specificity as well as neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-HCMV effector functions, and compared to an HCMV-seropositive cohort. gB/MF59 vaccination elicited IgG responses with gB-binding magnitude and avidity comparable to natural infection. Additionally, IgG subclass distribution was similar with predominant IgG1 and IgG3 responses induced by gB vaccination and HCMV infection. However, vaccine-elicited antibodies exhibited limited neutralization of the autologous virus, negligible neutralization of multiple heterologous strains, and limited binding responses against gB structural motifs targeted by neutralizing antibodies including AD-1, AD-2, and Domain I. Interestingly, vaccinees had high-magnitude IgG responses against AD-3 linear epitopes, demonstrating immunodominance against this non-neutralizing, cytosolic region. Finally, vaccine-elicited IgG robustly bound trimeric, membrane-associated gB on the surface of transfected or HCMV-infected cells and mediated virion phagocytosis, though were poor mediators of NK cell activation. Altogether, these data suggest that non-neutralizing antibody functions, including virion phagocytosis, likely played a role in the observed 50% vaccine-mediated protection against HCMV acquisition.\\n\\nSignificanceThe CDC estimates that every hour, a child is born in the United States with permanent neurologic disability resulting from human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection - more than is caused by Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, and neural tube defects combined. A maternal vaccine to block transmission of HCMV to the developing fetus is a necessary intervention to prevent these adverse outcomes. The gB/MF59 vaccine is the most successful tested clinically to-date, achieving 50% reduction in HCMV acquisition. This manuscript establishes the function and epitope specificity of the humoral response stimulated by this vaccine that may explain the partial vaccine efficacy. Understanding the mechanism of gB/MF59-elicited protective immune responses will guide rational design and evaluation of the next generation of HCMV vaccines.",

However, the source of these top-down predictions, especially when complex and multisensory, remains largely unknown. We hypothesised that the hippocampus -- which rapidly learns arbitrary associations and has bidirectional connections with sensory systems -- may be involved. We exposed humans to auditory cues predicting visual shapes, while measuring high-resolution fMRI signals in visual cortex and the hippocampus. Using multivariate reconstruction methods, we discovered a dissociation between these regions: representations in visual cortex were dominated by whichever shape was presented, whereas representations in the hippocampus (CA3 and subiculum, but not CA1) reflected only which shape was predicted by the cue. The strength of hippocampal predictions correlated across participants with the amount of expectation-related facilitation in visual cortex. These findings are consistent with the possibility that the hippocampus supplies predictions to sensory systems.",

We show that this system allows expression of the spatial navigational behaviour and neuronal firing patterns characteristic of real open arenas (R).

Theta frequency increased less with running speed in VR than in R, while firing rates increased similarly in both. Place, but not grid, cell firing was more directional in VR than R. These results suggest that the scale of grid and place cell firing patterns, and the frequency of theta, reflect translational motion inferred from both virtual (visual and proprioceptive) cues and uncontrolled static (vestibular translation and extra-maze) cues, while firing rates predominantly reflect visual and proprioceptive motion. They also suggest that omni-directional place cell firing in R reflects local-cues unavailable in VR.",

    "abstract": "Speech intelligibility is currently measured by scoring how well a person can identify a speech signal. The results of such behavioral measures reflect neural processing of the speech signal, but are also influenced by language processing, motivation and memory. Very often electrophysiological measures of hearing give insight in the neural processing of sound. However, in most methods non-speech stimuli are used, making it hard to relate the results to behavioral measures of speech intelligibility. The use of natural running speech as a stimulus in electrophysiological measures of hearing is a paradigm shift which allows to bridge the gap between behavioral and electrophysiological measures. Here, by decoding the speech envelope from the electroencephalogram, and correlating it with the stimulus envelope, we demonstrate an electrophysiological measure of neural processing of running speech. We show that behaviorally measured speech intelligibility is strongly correlated with our electrophysiological measure. Our results pave the way towards an objective and automatic way of assessing neural processing of speech presented through auditory prostheses, reducing confounds such as attention and cognitive capabilities. We anticipate that our electrophysiological measure will allow better differential diagnosis of the auditory system, and will allow the development of closed-loop auditory prostheses that automatically adapt to individual users.",

    "abstract": "Oscillations in local field potentials (LFPs) commonly occur and analyses of them fuel brain function hypotheses. An understanding of the cellular correlates and pathways affecting LFPs is needed but many overlapping pathways in vivo makes this difficult to achieve. A prevalent LFP rhythm in the hippocampus is  theta (3-12 Hz). Theta rhythms emerge intrinsically in an in vitro whole hippocampus preparation and thus can be produced by local interactions between interneurons and pyramidal (PYR) cells. Overlapping pathways are much reduced in this preparation making it possible to decipher the contribution of different cell types to LFP generation. We focus on oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (OLM) cells as a major class of interneurons in the hippocampus. They can influence PYR cells through two distinct pathways, (i) by direct inhibition of PYR cell distal dendrites, and (ii) by indirect disinhibition of PYR cell proximal dendrites by inhibiting bistratified cells (BiCs) that target them. We use previous inhibitory network models and build biophysical LFP models using volume conductor theory. We assess the effect of OLM cells to ongoing intrinsic LFP theta rhythms by directly comparing our model LFP features with experiment. We find that robust LFP theta responses adhering to reproducible experimental criteria occur only for particular connectivities between OLM cells and BiCs. Decomposition of the LFP reveals that OLM cell inputs onto the PYR cell regulate robustness of LFP responses without affecting average power and that the robust response depends on co-activation of distal inhibition and basal excitation. We use our models to estimate the spatial extent of the region generating LFP theta rhythms, leading us to predict that about 22,000 PYR cells participate in generating the LFP theta rhythm. Besides allowing us to understand OLM cells contributions to intrinsic theta rhythms, our work can drive hypothesis developments of cellular contributions in vivo.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryOscillatory local field potentials (LFPs) are extracellularly recorded potentials that are widely used to interpret information processing in the brain. For example, theta LFP rhythms (3-12 Hz) are correlated with memory processing and it is known that particular inhibitory cell types control their existence. As such, it is critical for us to appreciate how various cell types contribute to the characteristics of LFP rhythms. A precise biophysical modeling scheme linking activity at the cellular level and the recorded signal has been established. However, it is difficult to assess cellular contributions in vivo because of many spatiotemporally overlapping pathways that prevent the unambiguous separation of signals. Using an in vitro preparation that exhibits intrinsic theta (3-12 Hz) rhythms and where there is much less overlap, we build biophysical LFP models to explore cell contributions to ongoing intrinsic theta rhythms. We uncover distinct contributions from different cell types and show that robust theta rhythms depend specifically on one of the cell types. We are able to determine this because our LFP models have direct links with experiment and we are able to perform thousands of simulations.",

Quantifying the selective pressures that act on natural variation in grass species is therefore essential regarding biodiversity maintenance. In this study, we investigate the selection pressures that act on two distinct populations of the grass model Brachypodium distachyon without prior knowledge about the traits under selection. We took advantage of whole-genome sequencing data produced for 44 natural accessions of B. distachyon and used complementary genome-wide scans of selection (GWSS) methods to detect genomic regions under balancing and positive selection. We show that selection is shaping genetic diversity at multiple temporal and spatial scales in this species and affects different genomic regions across the two populations. Gene Ontology annotation of candidate genes reveals that pathogens may constitute important factors of positive and balancing selection in Brachypodium distachyon. We eventually cross-validated our results with QTL data available for leaf-rust resistance in this species and demonstrate that, when paired with classical trait mapping, GWSS can help pinpointing candidate genes for further molecular validation. Thanks to a near-base perfect reference genome and the large collection of freely available natural accessions collected across its natural range, B. distachyon appears as a prime system for studies in ecology, population genomics and evolutionary biology.",
