    "abstract": "Perceptual experience results from a complex interplay of bottom-up input and prior knowledge about the world, yet the extent to which knowledge affects perception, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects, and the stages of processing at which these two sources of information converge, are still unclear. In several experiments we show that language, in the form of verbal cues, both aids recognition of ambiguous \\\"Mooney\\\" images and improves objective visual discrimination performance in a match/non-match task. We then used electroencephalography (EEG) to better understand the mechanisms of this effect. The improved discrimination of images previously labeled was accompanied by a larger occipital-parietal P1 evoked response to the meaningful versus meaningless target stimuli. Time-frequency analysis of the interval between the cue and the target stimulus revealed increases in the power of posterior alpha-band (8-14 Hz) oscillations when the meaning of the stimuli to be compared was trained. The magnitude of the pre-target alpha difference and the P1 amplitude difference were positively correlated across individuals. These results suggest that prior knowledge prepares the brain for upcoming perception via the modulation of alpha-band oscillations, and that this preparatory state influences early (~120 ms) stages of visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in a microbial population can increase the frequency of a genotype not only by increasing its exponential growth rate, but also by decreasing its lag time or adjusting the yield (resource efficiency). The contribution of multiple life-history traits to selection is a critical question for evolutionary biology as we seek to predict the evolutionary fates of mutations. Here we use a model of microbial growth to show there are two distinct components of selection corresponding to the growth and lag phases, while the yield modulates their relative importance. The model predicts rich population dynamics when there are tradeo[ff]s between phases: multiple strains can coexist or exhibit bistability due to frequency-dependent selection, and strains can engage in rock-paper-scissors interactions due to non-transitive selection. We characterize the environmental conditions and patterns of traits necessary to realize these phenomena, which we show to be readily accessible to experiments. Our results provide a theoretical framework for analyzing high-throughput measurements of microbial growth traits, especially interpreting the pleiotropy and correlations between traits across mutants. This work also highlights the need for more comprehensive measurements of selection in simple microbial systems, where the concept of an ordinary fitness landscape breaks down.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPhenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) are a high-throughput approach to evaluate comprehensive associations between genetic variants and a wide range of phenotypic measures. PheWAS has varying sample sizes for quantitative traits, and variable numbers of cases and controls for binary traits across the many phenotypes of interest, which can affect the statistical power to detect associations. The motivation of this study is to investigate the various parameters which affect the estimation of statistical power in PheWAS, including sample size, case-control ratio, minor allele frequency, and disease penetrance.\\n\\nResultsWe performed a PheWAS simulation study, where we investigated variations in statistical power based on different parameters, such as overall sample size, number of cases, case-control ratio, minor allele frequency, and disease penetrance. The simulation was performed on both binary and quantitative phenotypic measures. Our simulation on binary traits suggests that the number of cases has more impact than the case to control ratio; also, we found that a sample size of 200 cases or more maintains the statistical power to identify associations for common variants. For quantitative traits, a sample size of 1000 or more individuals performed best in the power calculations. We focused on common genetic variants (MAF>0.01) in this study; however, in future studies, we will be extending this effort to perform similar simulations on rare variants.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study provides a series of PheWAS simulation analyses that can be used to estimate statistical power for some potential scenarios. These results can be used to provide guidelines for appropriate study design for future PheWAS analyses.",

    "abstract": "If the brain abstractly represents probability distributions as knowledge, then the modality of a decision, e.g. movement vs perception, should not matter. If on the other hand, learned representations are policies, they may be specific to the task where learning takes place. Here, we test this by asking if a learned spatial prior generalizes from a sensorimotor estimation task to a two-alternative-forced choice (2-Afc) perceptual comparison task. A model and simulation-based analysis revealed that while participants learn the experimentally-imposed prior distribution in the sensorimotor estimation task, measured priors are consistently broader than expected in the 2-Afc task. That the prior does not fully generalize suggests that sensorimotor priors strongly resemble policies. In disagreement with standard Bayesian thought, the modality of the decision has a strong influence on the implied prior distribution.\\n\\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYWe do not know if the brain represents abstract and generalizable knowledge or task-specific policies that map internal states to actions. We find that learning in a sensorimotor task does not generalize strongly to a perceptual task, suggesting that humans learned policies and did not truly acquire knowledge. Priors differ across tasks, thus casting doubt on the central tenet of may Bayesian models, that the brains representation of the world is built on generalizable knowledge.",

    "abstract": "The island of Madagascar has a unique biodiversity, mainly located in the tropical forests of the island. This biodiversity is highly threatened by anthropogenic deforestation. Existing historical forest maps at national level are scattered and have substantial gaps which prevent an exhaustive assessment of long-term deforestation trends in Madagascar. In this study, we combined historical national forest cover maps (covering the period 1953-2000) with a recent global annual tree cover loss dataset (2001-2014) to look at six decades of deforestation and forest fragmentation in Madagascar (from 1953 to 2014). We produced new forest cover maps at 30 m resolution for the year 1990 and annually from 2000 to 2014 over the full territory of Madagascar. We estimated that Madagascar has lost 44% of its natural forest cover over the period 1953-2014 (including 37% over the period 1973-2014). Natural forests cover 8.9 Mha in 2014 (15% of the national territory) and include 4.4 Mha (50%) of moist forests, 2.6 Mha (29%) of dry forests, 1.7 Mha of spiny forests (19%) and 177,000 ha (2%) of mangroves. Since 2005, the annual deforestation rate has progressively increased in Madagascar to reach 99,000 ha/yr during 2010-2014 (corresponding to a rate of 1.1%/yr). Around half of the forest (46%) is now located at less than 100 m from the forest edge. Our approach could be replicated to other developing countries with tropical forest. Accurate forest cover change maps can be used to assess the effectiveness of past and current conservation programs and implement new strategies for the future. In particular, forest maps and estimates can be used in the REDD+ framework which aims at \\\"Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation\\\" and for optimizing the current protected area network.",

Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate techniques, we studied the spatial and temporal dynamics of task and object processing. Our results reveal a sequence of separate but overlapping task-related processes spread across frontoparietal and occipitotemporal cortex. Task exhibited late effects on object processing by selectively enhancing task-relevant object features, with limited impact on the overall pattern of object representations. Combining MEG and fMRI data, we reveal a parallel rise in task-related signals throughout the cerebral cortex, with an increasing dominance of task over object representations from early to higher visual areas. Collectively, our results reveal the complex dynamics underlying task and object representations throughout human cortex.",

    "abstract": "Given the same sensory stimuli in the same task, human observers do not always make the same response. Well-known sources of behavioral variability are sensory noise and guessing. Visual short-term memory studies have suggested that the precision of the sensory noise is itself variable. However, it is unknown whether precision is also variable in perceptual tasks without a memory component. We searched for evidence for variable precision in 11 visual perception tasks with a single relevant feature, orientation. We specifically examined the effect of distractor stimuli: distractors were absent, homogeneous and fixed across trials, homogeneous and variable, or heterogeneous and variable. We first considered four models: with and without guessing, and with and without variability in precision. We quantified the importance of both factors using six metrics: factor knock-in difference, factor knock-out difference, and log factor posterior ratio, each based on AIC or BIC. According to all six metrics, we found strong evidence for variable precision in five experiments. Next, we extended our model space to include potential confounding factors: the oblique effect and decision noise. This left strong evidence for variable precision in only one experiment, in which distractors were homogeneous but variable. Finally, when we considered suboptimal decision rules, the evidence also disappeared in this experiment. Our results provide little evidence for variable precision overall and only a hint when distractors are variable. Methodologically, the results underline the importance of including multiple factors in factorial model comparison: testing for only two factors would have yielded an incorrect conclusion.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive processes do not occur by pure insertion and instead depend on the full complement of co-occurring mental processes, including perceptual and motor functions. As such, there is limited ecological validity to human neuroimaging experiments that use highly controlled tasks to isolate mental processes of interest. However, a growing literature shows how dynamic, interactive tasks have allowed researchers to study cognition as it more naturally occurs. Collective analysis across such neuroimaging experiments may answer broader questions regarding how naturalistic cognition is biologically distributed throughout the brain. We applied an unbiased, data-driven, meta-analytic approach that uses k-means clustering to identify core brain networks engaged across the naturalistic functional neuroimaging literature. Functional decoding allowed us to, then, delineate how information is distributed between these networks throughout the execution of dynamical cognition in realistic settings. This analysis revealed seven recurrent patterns of brain activation, representing sensory, domain-specific, and attentional neural networks that support the cognitive demands of naturalistic paradigms. Though gaps in the literature remain, these results suggest that naturalistic fMRI paradigms recruit a common set of networks that that allow both separate processing of different streams of information and integration of relevant information to enable flexible cognition and complex behavior.",

    "abstract": "Cospeciation studies aim at investigating whether hosts and symbionts speciate simultaneously or whether the associations diversify through host shifts. This problem is often tackled through reconciliation analyses that map the symbiont phylogeny onto the host phylogeny by mixing different types of diversification events. These reconciliations can be difficult to interpret and not always biologically realistic. Researchers have underlined that the biogeographic histories of both hosts and symbionts influence the probability of cospeciation and host switches, but up to now no reconciliation software integrates geographic data. We present a new functionality in the Mowgli software that bridges this gap. The user can provide geographic information on both the host and symbiont extant and ancestral taxa. Constraints in the reconciliation algorithm have been implemented to generate biologically realistic codiversification scenarios. We apply our method to the fig/fig wasp association and infer diversification scenarios that differ from reconciliations ignoring geographic information. In addition, we updated the reconciliation viewer SylvX in order to visualize ancestral character states on the phylogenetic trees and highlight zones that are geographically inconsistent in reconciliations computed without geographic constraints. We suggest that the comparison of reconciliations obtained with and without constraints can help solving ambiguities in the biogeographic histories of the partners. With the development of robust methods in historical biogeography and the advent of next-generation sequencing that leads to better-resolved trees, a geography aware reconciliation method represents a substantial advance that is likely to be useful to researchers studying the evolution of biotic interactions and biogeography.",

Genetic interactions are defined by linear forms with integer coefficients in the fitness variables assigned to genotypes. These forms generalize several popular approaches to study interactions, including Fourier-Walsh coefficients, interaction coordinates, and circuits. We assume that fitness measurements come with high uncertainty or are even unavailable, as is the case for many empirical studies, and derive interactions only from comparisons of genotypes with respect to their fitness, i.e. from partial fitness orders. We present a characterization of the class of partial fitness orders that imply interactions, using a graph-theoretic approach. Our characterization then yields an efficient algorithm for testing the condition when certain genetic interactions, such as sign epistasis, are implied. This provides an exponential improvement of the best previously known method. We also present a geometric interpretation of our characterization, which provides the basis for statistical analysis of partial fitness orders and genetic interactions.",

The dynamics of the place cell activity for familiar environment changes gradually over time, suggesting that this temporal dynamics enables to allocate different neural codes for spatially identical but temporally different episodes. To understand the mechanisms determining the dynamics of place cell populations, activity of hippocampal CA1 neurons was imaged during repeated performance in a spatial memory task. Comparing ensemble representations among multiple task sessions revealed that overlap rate of active place cell population was time-dependent, but independent of the number of tasks within a fixed time. This time-dependent change of hippocampal ensemble activity was suppressed by the administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist. These results suggested that the gradual change of activity pattern works as a time code, and NMDA receptor-dependent processes forms the code.",

    "abstract": "The growth and dynamics of epithelial tissues govern many morphogenetic processes in embryonic development. A recent quantitative transition in data acquisition, facilitated by advances in genetic and live-imaging techniques, is paving the way for new insights to these processes. Computational models can help us understand and interpret observations, and then make predictions for future experiments that can distinguish between hypothesised mechanisms. Increasingly, cell-based modelling approaches such as vertex models are being used to help understand the mechanics underlying epithelial morphogenesis. These models typically seek to reproduce qualitative phenomena, such as cell sorting or tissue buckling. However, it remains unclear to what extent quantitative data can be used to constrain these models so that they can then be used to make quantitative, experimentally testable predictions. To address this issue, we perform an in silico study to investigate whether vertex model parameters can be inferred from imaging data, and explore methods to quantify the uncertainty of such estimates. Our approach requires the use of summary statistics to estimate parameters. Here, we focus on summary statistics of cellular packing and of laser ablation experiments, as are commonly reported from imaging studies. We find that including data from repeated experiments is necessary to generate reliable parameter estimates that can facilitate quantitative model predictions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPartial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) is a popular machine learning tool that is gaining increasing attention as a useful feature selector and classifier. In an effort to understand its strengths and weaknesses, we performed a series of experiments with synthetic data and compared its performance to its close relative from which it was initially invented, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that even though PCA ignores the information regarding the class labels of the samples, this unsupervised tool can be remarkably effective as a feature selector. In some cases, it outperforms PLS-DA, which is made aware of the class labels in its input. Our experiments range from looking at the signal-to-noise ratio in the feature selection task, to considering many practical distributions and models encountered when analyzing bioinformatics and clinical data. Other methods were also evaluated. Finally, we analyzed an interesting data set from 396 vaginal microbiome samples where the ground truth for the feature selection was available.

    "abstract": "Goal-driven convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been shown to be able to predict and decode cortical responses to natural images or videos. Here, we explored an alternative deep neural network, variational auto-encoder (VAE), as a computational model of the visual cortex. We trained a VAE with a five-layer encoder and a five-layer decoder to learn visual representations from a diverse set of unlabeled images. Inspired by the \\\"free-energy principle\\\" in neuroscience, we modeled the brains bottom-up and top-down pathways using the VAEs encoder and decoder, respectively. Following such conceptual relationships, we found that the VAE was able to predict cortical activities observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from three human subjects watching natural videos. Compared to CNN, VAE resulted in relatively lower prediction accuracies, especially for higher-order ventral visual areas. On the other hand, fMRI responses could be decoded to estimate the VAEs latent variables, which in turn could reconstruct the visual input through the VAEs decoder. This decoding strategy was more advantageous than alternative decoding methods based on partial least square regression. This study supports the notion that the brain, at least in part, bears a generative model of the visual world.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionSepsis is a major health crisis in US hospitals, and several clinical identification systems have been designed to help care providers with early diagnosis of sepsis. However, many of these systems demonstrate low specificity or sensitivity, which limits their clinical utility. We evaluate the effects of a machine learning algodiagnostic (MLA) sepsis prediction and detection system using a before-and-after clinical study performed at Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH) in Huntington, West Virginia. Prior to this study, CHH utilized the St. Johns Sepsis Agent (SJSA) as a rules-based sepsis detection system.\\n\\nMethodsThe Predictive algoRithm for EValuation and Intervention in SEpsis (PREVISE) study was carried out between July 1, 2017 and August 30, 2017. All patients over the age of 18 who were admitted to the emergency department or intensive care units at CHH were monitored during the study. We assessed pre-implementation baseline metrics during the month of July, 2017, when the SJSA was active. During implementation in the month of August, 2017, SJSA and the MLA concurrently monitored patients for sepsis risk. At the conclusion of the study period, the primary outcome of sepsis-related in-hospital mortality and secondary outcome of sepsis-related hospital length of stay were compared between the two groups.\\n\\nResultsSepsis-related in-hospital mortality decreased from 3.97% to 2.64%, a 33.5% relative decrease (P = 0.038), and sepsis-related length of stay decreased from 2.99 days in the pre-implementation phase to 2.48 days in the post-implementation phase, a 17.1% relative reduction (P < 0.001).\\n\\nConclusionReductions in patient mortality and length-of-stay were observed with use of a machine learning algorithm for early sepsis detection in the emergency department and intensive care units at Cabell Huntington Hospital, and may present a method for improving patient outcomes.\\n\\nTrial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03235193, retrospectively registered on July 27th 2017.",

Apart from changes in cell shape, the requirements for this tissue spreading are not well understood. Here we analyze spreading of the extraembryonic serosa in the scuttle fly Megaselia abdita. The serosa forms from a columnar blastoderm anlage, becomes a squamous epithelium, and eventually spreads over the embryo proper. We describe the dynamics of this process in long-term, whole-embryo time-lapse recordings, demonstrating that free serosa spreading is preceded by a prolonged pause in tissue expansion. Closer examination of this pause reveals mechanical coupling to the underlying yolk sac, which is later released. We find mechanical coupling prolonged and serosa spreading impaired after knockdown of M. abdita Matrix metalloprotease 1. We conclude that tissue-tissue interactions provide a critical functional element to constrain spreading epithelia.\\n\\nImpact StatementExtraembryonic tissue spreading in the scuttle fly Megaselia abdita requires mechanical decoupling from the underlying yolk sac.",

Prior to investigating the domestication history of maize (Zea mays subspecies mays), one should first understand the population history of teosintes and how they relate to maize. To achieve this, we used 32,739 SNPs obtained from a broad sampling of teosinte populations and 46 maize landraces and a) inferred current and past gene flow among teosinte populations and maize, b) analyzed the degree of introgression among Zea mays subspecies, and c) explored the putative domestication location of maize. We found geographic structure and introgression between Zea mays taxa. Teosinte subspecies have diverged significantly from maize, which indicates that current teosinte populations have evolved mainly independently from maize since the domestication.

In the insect olfactory system encoding of odor information undergoes a transition from a dense spatio-temporal population code in the antennal lobe to a sparse code in the mushroom body. However, the exact mechanisms shaping odor representations and their role in sensory processing are incompletely identified. Here, we investigate the transformation from dense to sparse odor representations in a spiking model of the insect olfactory system, focusing on two ubiquitous neural mechanisms: spike-frequency adaptation at the cellular level and lateral inhibition at the circuit level. We find that cellular adaptation is essential for sparse representations in time (temporal sparseness), while lateral inhibition regulates sparseness in the neuronal space (population sparseness). The interplay of both mechanisms shapes dynamical odor representations, which are optimized for discrimination of odors during stimulus onset and offset. In addition, we find that odor identity is stored on a prolonged time scale in the adaptation levels but not in the spiking activity of the principal cells of the mushroom body, providing a testable hypothesis for the location of the so-called odor trace.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundL1 retrotransposons have co-evolved with their mammalian hosts for the entire history of mammals and currently make up to 20% of a typical mammalian genome. B1 retrotransposons are dependent on L1 for retrotransposition and span the evolutionary history of rodents since their radiation. L1s were found to have lost their activity in a group of South American rodents, the Sigmodontinae, and B1 inactivation preceded the extinction of L1 in the same group. Consequently, a basal group of sigmodontines have active L1s but inactive B1s and a derived clade have both inactive L1s and B1s. It has been suggested that B1s became extinct during a long period of L1 quiescence and that L1s subsequently reemerged in the basal group.\\n\\nResultsHere we investigate the evolutionary histories of L1 and B1 in the sigmodontine rodents and show that L1 activity continued until after the split of the L1-extinct clade and the basal group. After the split, L1s had a small burst of activity in the former group, followed by extinction. In the basal group, activity was initially low but was followed by a dramatic increase in L1 activity. We found the last wave of B1s retrotransposition was large and probably preceded the split between the two rodent clades.\\n\\nConclusionsGiven that L1s had been steadily retrotransposing during the time corresponding to B1 extinction and that the burst of B1 activity preceding B1 extinction was large, we conclude that B1 extinction was not a result of L1 quiescence. Rather, the burst of B1 activity may have contributed to L1 extinction both by competition with L1 and by putting strong selective pressure on the host to control retrotransposition.",

    "abstract": "Conrad H. Waddington discovered the phenomenon of genetic assimilation through a series of experiments on fruit flies. In those experiments, artificially exerted environmental stress induced plastic phe-notypic changes in the fruit flies, but after some generations the same phenotypic variant started to appear without the environmental stress. Both the initial state (where the phenotypic changes were environmentally induced and plastic) and the final state (where the phenotypic changes were genetically fixed and constitutive) are experimental facts. However, it remains unclear how the environmentally induced phenotypic change in the first generation becomes genetically fixed in the central process of genetic assimilation itself. We have argued that the key to understanding the mechanism of genetic assimilation lies in epigenetics, and proposed the \\\"cooperative model\\\" in which the evolutionary process depends on both genetic and epigenetic factors. Evolutionary simulations based on the cooperative model reproduced the process of genetic assimilation. Detailed analysis of the trajectories has revealed genetic assimilation is a process in which epigenetically induced phe-notypic changes are incrementally and statistically replaced with multiple minor genetic mutations through natural selection. In this scenario, epigenetic and genetic changes may be considered as mutually independent but equivalent in terms of their effects on phenotypic changes. This finding rejects the common (and confused) hypothesis that epigenetically induced phe-notypic changes depend on genetic mutations. Furthermore, we argue that transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is not required for evolution by genetic assimilation.",

Here we show that a normal diffusion of replication fork components towards localized potential replication origins (p-oris) can more simply account for the I(t) universal bell shape, as a consequence of a competition between the origin firing time and the time needed to replicate DNA separating two neighboring p-oris. We predict the I(t) maximal value to be the product of the replication fork speed with the squared p-ori density. We show that this relation is robustly observed in simulations and in experimental data for several eukaryotes. Our work underlines that fork-component recycling and potential origins localization are sufficient spatial ingredients to explain the universality of DNA replication kinetics.",

Loss of this circadian oscillation pattern during stress and disease correlates with increased fat mass and obesity in humans, raising the intriguing question of how hormone secretion dynamics affect the process of adipocyte differentiation. By using live, single-cell imaging of the key adipogenic transcription factors CEBPB and PPARG, endogenously tagged with fluorescent proteins, we show that pulsatile circadian hormone stimuli are rejected by the adipocyte differentiation control system, leading to very low adipocyte differentiation rates. In striking contrast, equally strong persistent signals trigger maximal differentiation. We identify the mechanism of how hormone oscillations are filtered as a combination of slow and fast positive feedback centered on PPARG. Furthermore, we confirm in mice that flattening of daily glucocorticoid oscillations significantly increases the mass of subcutaneous and visceral fat pads. Together, our study provides a molecular mechanism for why stress, Cushings disease, and other conditions for which glucocorticoid secretion loses its pulsatility can lead to obesity.

    "abstract": "Malarial dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (DPAPs) are cysteine proteases important for parasite development thus making them attractive drug targets. In order to develop inhibitors specific to the parasite enzymes it is necessary to map the determinants of substrate specificity of the parasite enzymes and its mammalian homologue cathepsin C (CatC). Here, we screened peptide-based libraries of substrates and covalent inhibitors to characterize the differences in specificity between parasite DPAPs and CatC, and used this information to develop highly selective DPAP1 and DPAP3 inhibitors. Interestingly, while the primary amino acid specificity of a protease is often used to develop potent inhibitors, we show that equally potent and highly specific inhibitors can be developed based on the sequences of non-optimal peptide substrates. Importantly, analysis of previously published data about the specificity of other proteases also unveiled significant discrepancies in the amino acid preference between substrates and inhibitors. In this article, we also discuss important structural and theoretical reasons that might account for these discrepancies. Overall, this study illustrates that focusing the development of protease inhibitors solely on substrate specificity might overlook important structural features that can be exploited to develop highly potent and selective compounds.",

Using a de novo gene prediction pipeline on both these genome assemblies, and those of three related species (Acyrthosiphon pisum, D. noxia and M. persicae), we show that aphid genomes consistently encode similar gene numbers, and in the case of A. pisum, fewer and larger genes than previously reported. We compare gene content, gene duplication, synteny, horizontal gene transfer events, and putative effector repertoires between these five species to understand the genome evolution of globally important plant parasites.\\n\\nAphid genomes show signs of relatively distant gene duplication, and substantial, relatively recent, gene birth, and are characterized by disparate gain and loss of genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Such HGT events account for approximately 1% of loci, and contribute to the protein-coding content of aphid species analysed. Putative effector repertoires, originating from duplicated loci, putative HGT events and other loci, have an unusual genomic organisation and evolutionary history. We identify a highly conserved effector-pair that is tightly genetically-linked in all aphid species. In R. padi, this effector pair is tightly transcriptionally-linked, and shares a transcriptional control mechanism with a subset of approximately 50 other putative effectors distributed across the genome.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study extends our current knowledge on the evolution of aphid genomes and reveals evidence for a shared control mechanism, which underlies effector expression, and ultimately plant parasitism.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative genetic analyses require extensive measurements of phenotypic traits, a task that is often not trivial, especially in wild populations. On top of instrumental measurement error, some traits may undergo transient (i.e. non-persistent) fluctuations that are biologically irrelevant for selection processes. These two sources of variability, which we denote here as measurement error in a broad sense, are possible causes for bias in the estimation of quantitative genetic parameters. We illustrate how in a continuous trait transient effects with a classical measurement error structure may bias estimates of heritability, selection gradients, and the predicted response to selection. We propose strategies to obtain unbiased estimates with the help of repeated measurements taken at an appropriate temporal scale. However, the fact that in quantitative genetic analyses repeated measurements are also used to isolate permanent environmental instead of transient effects, requires a re-assessment of the information content of repeated measurements. To do so, we propose to distinguish \\\"short-term\\\" from \\\"long-term\\\" repeats, where the former capture transient variability and the latter the permanent effects. We show how the inclusion of the corresponding variance components in quantitative genetic models yields unbiased estimates of all quantities of interest, and we illustrate the application of the method to data from a Swiss snow vole population.",

We here developed a method, SECRiFY, to simultaneously assess the secretability of >105 protein fragments by two yeast species, S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris, using custom fragment libraries, surface display and a sequencing-based readout. Screening human proteome fragments with a median size of 50 - 100 amino acids, we generated datasets that enable datamining into protein features underlying secretability, revealing a striking role for intrinsic disorder and chain flexibility. SECRiFY is the first methodology that generates sufficient amounts of annotated data for advanced machine learning methods to deduce secretability predictors. The finding that secretability is indeed a learnable feature of protein sequences is of significant impact in the broad area of recombinant protein expression and de novo protein design.",

Three contain genes relevant for AD and neurodegeneration: ADAM10, ADAMTS4, and ACE. Suggestive loci include drug targets such as VKORC1 (warfarin dose) and BZRAP1 (benzodiazepine receptor). We report evidence that association of SNPs and AD at the PVR gene is potentially mediated by both gene expression and DNA methylation in the prefrontal cortex.

Understanding the mechanisms involved in controlling such interactions remains a major challenge. In an unbiased approach we identified key players that control the symbiosis between Hydra viridissima and its photobiont Chlorella sp. A99. We discovered significant upregulation of Hydra genes encoding a phosphate transporter and glutamine synthetase suggesting regulated nutrition supply between host and symbionts. Interestingly, supplementing the medium with glutamine temporarily supports in vitro growth of the otherwise obligate symbiotic Chlorella, indicating loss of autonomy and dependence on the host. Genome sequencing of Chlorella A99 revealed a large number of amino acid transporters and a degenerated nitrate assimilation pathway, presumably as consequence of the adaptation to the host environment. Our observations portray ancient symbiotic interactions as a codependent partnership in which exchange of nutrients appears to be the primary driving force.",

    "abstract": "The reproducibility of embryonic development is remarkable, although molecular processes are intrinsically stochastic at the single-cell level. How the multi-cellular system resists the inevitable noise to acquire developmental reproducibility constitutes a fundamental question in developmental biology. Toward this end, we focused on vertebrate somitogenesis as a representative system, because somites are repeatedly reproduced within a single embryo whereas such reproducibility is lost in segmentation clock gene-deficient embryos. However, the effect of noise on developmental reproducibility has not been fully investigated, because of the technical difficulty in manipulating the noise intensity in experiments. In this study, we developed a computational model of ERK-mediated somitogenesis, in which bistable ERK activity is regulated by an FGF gradient, cell-cell communication, and the segmentation clock, subject to the intrinsic noise. The model simulation generated our previous in vivo observation that the ERK activity was distributed in a step-like gradient in the presomitic mesoderm, and its boundary was posteriorly shifted by the clock in a stepwise manner, leading to regular somite formation. Here we showed that this somite regularity was robustly maintained against the noise. Removing the clock from the model predicted that the stepwise shift of the ERK activity occurs at irregular timing with irregular distance owing to the noise, resulting in somite size variation. Through theoretical analysis, we presented a mechanism by which the clock reduces the inherent somite irregularity observed in clock-deficient embryos. Therefore, this study indicates a novel role of the segmentation clock in noise-resistant developmental reproducibility.",

We find a surprisingly simple and intuitive analytical approximation for the establishment probabilities in a symmetric two-deme model under the assumption of weak (positive) selection. This is the first analytical closed-form approximation for arbitrary migration rate to appear in the literature. We find that the establishment probability lies between the weak and the strong migration limits if we condition the origin of the mutation to the deme where it is advantageous. This is not the case when we condition the mutation to first occur in a deme where it is disadvantageous. In this case we find that an intermediate migration rate maximizes the probability of establishment. We extend our results to the cases of multiple demes, two demes with asymmetric rates of gene flow, and asymmetric carrying capacities. The latter case allows us to illustrate how density regulation can affect establishment probabilities. Finally we use our results to investigate the role of gene flow on the rate of local adaptation and identify cases in which intermediate amounts of gene flow facilitate the rate of local adaptation as compared to two populations without gene flow.",

    "abstract": "Human malaria, which remains a major public health problem, is transmitted by a subset of Anopheles mosquitoes belonging to only three out of eight subgenera: Anopheles, Cellia and Nyssorhynchus. Unlike almost every other insect species, it was shown that males of some Anopheles species produce and transfer steroid hormones to females during copulation and that this transfer mediates reproductive changes. Steroids are consequently seen as a potential target for malaria vector control. Here, we analysed the evolution of sexually-transferred steroids and their effects on female reproductive traits across Anopheles by using a set of 16 mosquito species (5 Anopheles, 8 Cellia, and 3 Nyssorhynchus), including malaria vector and non-vector species. We show that male steroid production and transfer are specific to the Cellia subgenus and that there is no correlation between mating-induced effects in females and sexually-transferred steroids. In the light of our results, male steroid production, transfer and post-mating effects in females do not correlate with their ability to transmit human malaria, which overturns the suggestion from previous studies and suggests that manipulation of steroid-response pathways in the field should be considered with caution in order to benefit malaria vector control strategies.",

For the first time, we report transgenerational epigenetic silencing of BRCA1 due to promoter hypermethylation in two families with breast/ovarian cancer.\\n\\nMethodsBRCA1 promoter methylation of ten CpG dinucleotides in breast/ovarian cancer families without germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants was assessed by pyrosequencing and clonal bisulfite sequencing.

Soma-wide BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation was confirmed in blood, buccal mucosa and hair follicles.

    "abstract": "Epigenetic alteration has been implicated in aging. However, the mechanism by which epigenetic change impacts aging is unclear. H3K27me3, a highly conserved histone modification signifying transcriptional repression, is marked and maintained by Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs). Here, we explore the mechanism by which age-modulated increase of H3K27me3 impacts adult lifespan. Using Drosophila, we reveal that aging leads to loss of fidelity in epigenetic marking and drift of H3K27me3 and consequential reduction in the expression of glycolytic genes with negative effects on energy production and redox state. Moreover, we show that a reduction of H3K27me3 by PRCs-deficiency promotes glycolysis and healthy lifespan. While perturbing glycolysis by gene mutation diminishes the pro-lifespan benefits mediated by PRCs-deficiency, transgenic increase of glycolytic genes in wild-type animals extends longevity. Together, we propose that epigenetic drift of H3K27me3 defines a new aging mechanism and that stimulation of glycolysis promotes metabolic health and longevity.",

This paper complements the two-stage theory of causal induction proposed by Hattori and Oaksford (2007) with a computational analysis. We show that their dual-factor heuristic (DFH) model has a rational account as the square root of the index of (non-)independence under extreme rarity assumption, contrary to the criticism that the DFH model is non-normative (e.g., Lu et al., 2008). We introduce a model that considers the proportion of assumed-to-be rare instances (pARIs), which is the probability of biconditionals (according to several theories of compound conditionals) and can be seen as a simplified version of the DFH model. While being a single conditional probability, pARIs approximates the non-independence measure, the square of DFH. In reproducing the meta-analysis in Hattori and Oaksford (2007), we confirm that pARIs and DFH have the same level of descriptive adequacy, and that the two models have the highest fit among more than 40 models. Then, we critically examine the computer simulations which were central to the rational analysis in Hattori and Oaksford (2007). We point out two problems in their simluations: samples in some of the simulations being restricted to generative ones, and in-definite values of models because of the small samples. In the light of especially the latter problem of definability, pARIs shows higher applicability.",

Idiopathic epiretinal membrane (iEMR) and macular hole (MH) are the major vision-threatening vitreoretinal diseases affecting millions of aging people globally, making these conditions an important public health issue. The iERM is characterized by fibrous tissue developing on the surface of the macula, leading to biomechanical and biochemical macular damage. MH is a small breakage in the macula associated with many ocular conditions. Although several individual factors and pathways are suggested, a systems pathology level understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders is lacking. Therefore, we performed mass spectrometry based label-free quantitative proteomics analysis of the vitreous proteomes from patients with iERM (n=26) and MH (n=21) to identify the key proteins as well as the multiple interconnected biochemical pathways contributing to the development of these diseases. We identified a total of 1014 unique proteins, of which many were linked to inflammation and complement cascade, revealing the inflammational processes in retinal diseases. Additionally, we detected a profound difference in proteomes of the iEMR and MH compared to the non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. A large number of neuronal proteins were present at higher levels in iERM and MH vitreous, including neuronal adhesion molecules, nervous system development proteins and signalling molecules. This points toward the important role of neurodegeneration component in the pathogenesis of age-related vitreoretinal diseases. Despite of marked similarities, several unique vitreous proteins were identified in both iERM and MH conditions, providing a candidate targets for diagnostic and new therapeutic approaches. Identification of previously reported and novel proteins in human vitreous humor from patient with iERM and MH provide renewed understanding of the pathogenesis of age-related vitreoretinal diseases.",

Owing to difficulties in high-resolution structural studies, the driving forces of assembling these low-complexity polymers have yet to be elucidated. Polymer physics approaches captured the experimentally demonstrated critical role of binding element multivalency and highlighted the importance of linker solvation. Here we present a simulation method based on a fuzzy mathematical framework. This approach is suitable to handle the heterogeneity of interactions pattern generated by redundant binding motifs and the resulted multiplicity of conformational states. Using a hypothetical polymer, fuzzy simulations recapitulate the experimental observations on valency-dependence and are more efficient than the one-to-one binding model. Systematic studies on binding element affinity and linker dynamics demonstrate that these two factors present alternative scenarios to promote polymerization: stronger binding result in more ordered states, whereas increasing dynamics contributes to heterogeneity and a more favorable entropy of the assembly. We propose that the fuzzy framework could be employed to characterize/predict mutations leading to pathological aggregates.",

The recently identified fluorescence recovery protein (FRP) binds to the photoactivated OCP and accelerates its relaxation into the basal form, completing the regulatory circle. The molecular mechanism of FRP functioning is largely controversial. Moreover, since the available knowledge has mainly been gained from studying Synechocystis proteins, the cross-species conservation of the FRP mechanism remains unexplored. Besides phylogenetic analysis, we performed a detailed structural-functional analysis of two selected low-homology FRPs by comparing them with Synechocystis FRP (SynFRP). While adopting similar dimeric conformations in solution and preserving binding preferences of SynFRP toward various OCP variants, the low-homology FRPs demonstrated distinct binding stoichiometries and differentially accentuated features of this functional interaction. By providing clues to understand the FRP mechanism universally, our results also establish foundations for upcoming structural investigations necessary to elucidate the FRP-dependent regulatory mechanism.",

To achieve this goal, integrative resources and tools are needed that allow comparison of results across datasets and data types. We propose an intuitive approach for data-driven stratifications of molecular profiles and benchmark our methodology using the dimensional reduction algorithm t-SNE with multi-center and multi-platform data representing hematological malignancies. Our approach enables assessing the contribution of biological versus technical variation to sample clustering, direct incorporation of additional datasets to the same low dimensional representation of molecular disease subtypes, comparison of sample groups between separate t-SNE representations, or maps, and characterization of the obtained clusters based on pathway databases and additional multi-omics data. In the example application, our approach revealed differential activity of SAM-dependent DNA methylation pathway in the acute myeloid leukemia patient cluster characterized with CEBPA mutations that accordingly was validated to have globally elevated DNA methylation levels.",

We quantify dynamic interactions between epithelial cell sheets using cell lines of the squamous and columnar epithelia in human normal esophagus, Barretts esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma and find unique boundary formation between squamous and columnar cells. MOSES also measured subtle changes in the boundary formation caused by external stimuli.

    "abstract": "Alchemical free energy calculations (AFE) based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are key tools in both improving our understanding of a wide variety of biological processes and accelerating the design and optimization of therapeutics for numerous diseases. Computing power and theory have, however, long been insufficient to enable AFE calculations to be routinely applied in early stage drug discovery. One of the major difficulties in performing AFE calculations is the length of time required for calculations to converge to an ensemble average. CPU implementations of MD based free energy algorithms can effectively only reach tens of nanoseconds per day for systems on the order of 50,000 atoms, even running on massively parallel supercomputers. Therefore, converged free energy calculations on large numbers of potential lead compounds are often untenable, preventing researchers from gaining crucial insight into molecular recognition, potential druggability, and other crucial areas of interest. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) can help address this. We present here a seamless GPU implementation, within the PMEMD module of the AMBER molecular dynamics package, of thermodynamic integration (TI) capable of reaching speeds of >140 ns/day for a 44,907-atom system, with accuracy equivalent to the existing CPU implementation in AMBER. The implementation described here is currently part of the AMBER 18 beta code and will be an integral part of the upcoming version 18 release of AMBER.",

To reveal compensatory metabolic pathways, we investigated the metabolome-wide cellular response to inhibited glutaminolysis. We conducted metabolic profiling in the triple-negative breast cancer cell line MB-MDA-231, treated with different dosages of glutaminase inhibitor C.968 at multiple time points. We found that multiple molecules involved in lipid catabolism responded directly to glutamate deficiency as a presumed compensation for energy deficit. Accelerated lipid catabolism, together with oxidative stress induced by glutaminolysis inhibition, triggered autophagy. We therefore simultaneously inhibited glutaminolysis and autophagy, which induced cancer cell death. Our study emphasizes the potential of non-targeted metabolomics to characterize and identify metabolic escape mechanisms contributing to cancer cell survival under treatment. Our findings add to the increasing evidence that combined inhibition of glutaminolysis and autophagy may be effective in glutamine-addicted cancers.",

The broad range of number of cell types among species suggests that cell type origination is a significant source of evolutionary novelty. The molecular mechanisms giving rise to novel cell types, however, are poorly understood. Here we show that a novel cell type of eutherian mammals, the decidual stromal cell (DSC), evolved by rewiring an ancestral cellular stress response. We isolated the precursor cell type of DSCs, endometrial stromal fibroblasts (ESFs), from the opossum Monodelphis domestica. We show that, in opossum ESF, the majority of decidual core regulatory genes respond to decidualizing signals, but do not regulate decidual effector genes. Rather, in opossum ESF, decidual transcription factors function in apoptotic and oxidative stress response. We propose that the rewiring of cellular stress responses could be a general mechanism for the evolution of novel cell types.",

    "abstract": "Medawars mutation accumulation (MA) hypothesis explains ageing by the declining force of natural selection with age: slightly deleterious germline mutations that are functional in old age are not effectively eliminated by selection and therefore lead to ageing-related phenotypes. Although widely cited, empirical support for the MA hypothesis, particularly molecular evidence, has remained limited. Here we test one of its predictions, that genes relatively highly expressed in old adults vs. young adults should be under weaker purifying selection than those relatively highly expressed in young adults. To do so, we combine 23 RNA-sequencing and 35 microarray gene expression datasets (including 9 tissues from 5 mammalian species) with protein and regulatory sequence conservation estimates across mammals. We identify age-related decrease in transcriptome conservation (ADICT) in four tissues, brain, liver, lung, and artery, but not in other tissues, most notably muscle and heart. ADICT is driven both by decreased expression of highly conserved genes and up-regulation of poorly conserved genes during ageing, in line with the MA hypothesis. Lowly conserved and up-regulated genes in ADICT-associated tissues have overlapping functional properties, particularly involving apoptosis and inflammation, with no evidence for a history of positive selection. Our results suggest that tissues vary in how evolution has shaped their ageing patterns. We find that in some tissues, genes up-regulated during ageing, possibly in response to accumulating cellular and histological damage, are under weaker purifying selection than other genes. We propose that accumulation of slightly deleterious substitutions in these genes may underlie their suboptimal regulation and activity during ageing, shaping senescent phenotypes such as inflammaging.",

Most insect-pathogenic fungi in the order Hypocreales (Ascomycota) are generalist species with a broad host-range, and most species possess a high number of SLSPs. The other major clade of insect-pathogenic fungi is part of the subphylum Entomophthoromycotina (Zoopagomycota, formerly Zygomycota) which consists of high host-specificity insect-pathogenic fungi that naturally only infect a single or very few host species. The extent to which insect-pathogenic fungi in the order Entomophthorales rely on SLSPs is unknown. Here we take advantage of recently available transcriptomic and genomic datasets from four genera within Entomophthoromycotina: the saprobic or opportunistic pathogens Basidiobolus meristosporus, Conidiobolus coronatus, C. thromboides, C. incongruus, and the host-specific insect pathogens Entomphthora muscae and Pandora formicae, specific pathogens of house flies (Muscae domestica) and wood ants (Formica polyctena), respectively. We use phylogenetics and protein domain analysis to show that the obligate biotrophic fungi E. muscae, P. formicae and the saprobic human pathogen C. incongruus all contain \\\"classical\\\" fungal SLSPs and a unique group of SLSPs that loosely resembles bacillopeptidase F-like SLSPs. This novel group of SLSPs is found in the genomes of obligate insect pathogens and a generalist saprobic opportunistic pathogen why they are unlikely to be responsible for the host specificity of Entomophthorales. However, this class represent a unique group of SLSPs so far only observed among Bacteria, Oomycetes and early diverging fungi such as Cryptomycota, Microsporidia, and Entomophthoromycotina and missing in the sister fungal lineages of Kickxellomycotina or the fungal phyla Mucoromyocta, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota fungi suggesting interesting gene loss patterns.",

The level of nucleotide polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium decay were comparable to A. thaliana, indicating the feasibility of association studies. A reduction in purifying selection compared with parental species was observed. Interestingly, the proportion of adaptive substitutions () was significantly positive in contrast to the majority of plant species.

We report that in Drosophila, a generalised infection increased PSSC numbers. This was mimicked by expressing a constitutive form of the immune receptor Toll in PSSCs and blocked when Toll was silenced via RNAi. Without infection, absence of bacterial recognition and downstream Toll signalling resulted in a short lifespan and an age-dependent decrease of PSSCs and gut microbiota. The latter implied a metabolic environment incompatible with the presence of bacteria. Indeed, infection or constitutive Toll signalling in PSSCs triggered 4E-BP transcription in enterocytes, while loss of signalling reduced it. 4E-BP controlled fat levels and sustained the microbiota suggesting that Toll-dependent regulation of 4E-BP was important for long-term gut function. Therefore, the Toll pathway is crucial for responses to both infection and microbiota.",

Antibiotics, when used appropriately, are effective; however, their overuse and misuse has led to the rise of antibiotic resistance worldwide. Thus, there are renewed efforts into the development of phage therapy. Due to the drawbacks of EPEC in vivo models, a surrogate is the mouse-restricted gut pathgoen Citrobacter rodentium. In this study, two new phages CrRp3 and CrRp10, which infect C. rodentium, were isolated and characterized. CrRp3 was found to be a new species within the genus Vectrevirus and CrRp10 is a new strain within the genus Tequatrovirus. Neither phage carries known genes associated with bacterial virulence, antibiotic resistance, or lysogeny. CrRp3 and CrRp10 appear to have independently evolved from E. coli phages. CrRp3 appears to be the more  potent being 24x more likely to find a host cell and has a shorter lytic cycle, while CrRp10 at MOI 0.001 was able to maintain bacterial density below the limit of detection after 18 h. We found that hypoxia (5% O2 and 5% CO2) inhibited CrRp3 ability to reverse exponential bacterial growth.

    "abstract": "Detection of viruses in the environment is heavily dependent on PCR-based approaches that require reference sequences for primer design. While this strategy can accurately detect known viruses, it will not find novel genotypes, nor emerging and invasive viral species. In this study, we investigated the use of viromics, i.e. high-throughput sequencing of the biosphere viral fraction, to detect human/animal pathogenic RNA viruses in the Conwy river catchment area in Wales, UK. Using a combination of filtering and nuclease treatment, we extracted the viral fraction from wastewater, estuarine river water and sediment, followed by RNASeq analysis on the Illumina HiSeq platform for the discovery of RNA virus genomes. We found a higher richness of RNA viruses in wastewater samples than in river water and sediment, and assembled a complete norovirus GI.2 genome from wastewater effluent, which was not contemporaneously detected by conventional qRT-PCR. To our knowledge, this is the first environmentally-derived norovirus genome sequence to be available from a public database. The simultaneous presence of diverse rotavirus signatures in wastewater indicated the potential for zoonotic infections in the area and suggested run-off from pig farms as a possible origin of these viruses. Our results show that viromics can be an important tool in the discovery of pathogenic viruses in the environment and can be used to inform and optimize reference-based detection methods provided appropriate and rigorous controls are included.\\n\\nImportanceEnteric viruses cause gastro-intestinal illness and are commonly transmitted through the faecal-oral route. When wastewater is released into river systems, these viruses can contaminate the environment. Our results show that we can use viromics to find the range of potentially pathogenic viruses that are present in the environment and identify prevalent genotypes. The ultimate goal is to trace the fate of these pathogenic viruses from origin to the point where they are a threat to human health, informing reference-based detection methods and water quality management.",

    "abstract": "Crop disease outbreaks are often associated with clonal expansions of single pathogenic lineages. To determine whether similar boom-and-bust scenarios hold for wild plant pathogens, we carried out a multi-year multi-site survey of Pseudomonas in the natural host Arabidopsis thaliana. The most common Pseudomonas lineage corresponded to a pathogenic clade present in all sites. Sequencing of 1,524 Pseudomonas genomes revealed this lineage to have diversified approximately 300,000 years ago, containing dozens of genetically distinct pathogenic sublineages. These sublineages have expanded in parallel within the same populations and are differentiated both at the level of gene content and disease phenotype. Such coexistence of diverse sublineages indicates that in contrast to crop systems, no single strain has been able to overtake these A. thaliana populations in the recent past. Our results suggest that the selective pressures acting on a plant pathogen in wild hosts may be more complex than those in agricultural systems.",

    "abstract": "Cold storage is commonly employed to delay senescence in  Nanguo pears after harvest. However, this technique also causes fruit aroma weakening. MicroRNAs play important roles in plant development and in eliciting responses to abiotic environmental stressors. In this study, the miRNA transcript profile of the fruit at the first day (C0, LT0) move in and out of cold storage and the optimum tasting period (COTP, LTOTP) during shelf life at room temperature were analyzed, respectively. More than 300 known miRNAs were identified in  Nanguo pears; 176 and 135 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed on the C0 vs. LT0 and on the COTP vs. LTOTP, respectively. After prediction the target genes of these miRNAs, LOX2S, LOX1_5, HPL, and ADH1 were found differentially expressed, which were the key genes during aroma formation. The expression pattern of these target genes and the related miRNAs were identified by RT-PCR. Mdm-miR172a-h, mdm-miR159a/b/c, mdm-miR160a-e, mdm-miR395a-i, mdm/ppe-miR399a, mdm/ppe-miR535a/b, and mdm-miR7120a/b negatively regulated target gene expression. These results indicate that miRNAs play key roles in aroma weakening in refrigerated  Nanguo pear and provide valuable information for studying the molecular mechanisms of miRNAs in the aroma weakening of fruits due to cold storage.",

Here, we compare the effects of experimental stroke on EEG complexity using Lempel-Ziv complexity analysis (LZC) and multiscale entropy analysis (SampEn).\\n\\nEEG was recorded in bilateral motor cortex at baseline and during a 30-day recovery period after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. Motor function was assessed using a single pellet reaching task. Stroke caused an acute drop in both LZC and SampEn in the ipsilesional hemisphere in wakefulness, NREM and REM sleep, as well as reduced pellet reaching success. SampEn reductions persisted for at least 10 days post-stroke, whereas LZC had returned to baseline levels by day 4. EEG complexity in the contralesional hemisphere and in sham-operated animals were unaffected.\\n\\nIf EEG complexity reflects post-stroke brain function, post-stroke asymmetry could be used to predict behavioral recovery. In rats, acute LZC asymmetry was significantly correlated with the amount of motor function recovery by post-stroke day 31, but SampEn asymmetry was not. EEG LZC may thus be a useful tool for predicting functional recovery after stroke. MSE could be effective in identifying cortical dysfunction, but does not reflect behavioral outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Feeding is a complex motivated behavior controlled by a distributed neural network that processes sensory information to generate adaptive behavioral responses. Accordingly, studies using appetitive Pavlovian conditioning confirm that environmental cues that are associated with food availability can induce feeding even in satiated subjects. However, in mice, appetitive conditioning generally requires intensive training and thus can impede molecular studies that often require large numbers of animals. To address this, we developed and validated a simple and rapid context-induced feeding (ctx-IF) task in which cues associated with food availability can later lead to increased food consumption in sated mice. We show that the associated increase in food consumption is driven by both positive and negative reinforcement and that spaced training is more effective than massed training. Ctx-IF can be completed in [~]1 week and provides an opportunity to study the molecular mechanisms and circuitry underlying non-homeostatic eating. We have used this paradigm to map brain regions that are activated during Ctx-IF with cFos immunohistochemistry and found that the insular cortex, and other regions, are activated following exposure to cues denoting the availability of food. Finally, we show that inhibition of the insular cortex using GABA agonists impairs performance of the task. Our findings provide a novel assay in mice for defining the functional neuroanatomy of appetitive conditioning and identify specific brain regions that are activated during the development of learned behaviors that impact food consumption.",

    "abstract": "Under what conditions do humans systematically deviate from rational decision making? Here we show that pupillary indices of low neural gain are associated with strong and consistent biases across six different extensively-studied decision making tasks, whereas indices of high gain are associated with weak or absent biases. Lower susceptibility to biases, however, comes at the cost of indecisiveness, or alternatively, prolonged deliberation time. We explain the association between low gain and strong biases as reflecting a broader information integration process that gives greater weight to weak biasing influences. The findings underscore the role of pupil-linked brain states in the generation of decision making biases.\\n\\nSignificance\\\"Framing effects\\\" are demonstrations that peoples decisions can be biased by the way a decision problem is presented, and consequently, people can make decisions that violate the principles of rationality. Using a set of classic decision-making tasks, we show that pupil dilation, previously linked to levels of the neuromodulator norepinephrine and to a tradeoff between narrowly focused and broadly integrative modes of information processing, distinguishes between people who are consistently biased and people who are relatively immune to these effects. Our findings suggest that norepinephrine may drive these individual differences, and that a narrowly focused mode of information processing confers relative immunity to these decision making biases, whereas the integration of a wider range of information results in greater susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "For decades, fungi have been a source of FDA-approved natural products such as penicillin, cyclosporine, and the statins. Recent breakthroughs in DNA sequencing suggest that millions of fungal species exist on Earth with each genome encoding pathways capable of generating as many as dozens of natural products. However, the majority of encoded molecules are difficult or impossible to access because the organisms are uncultivable or the genes are transcriptionally silent. To overcome this bottleneck in natural product discovery, we developed the HEx (Heterologous EXpression) synthetic biology platform for rapid, scalable expression of fungal biosynthetic genes and their encoded metabolites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We applied this platform to 41 fungal biosynthetic gene clusters from diverse fungal species from around the world, 22 of which produced detectable compounds. These included novel compounds with unexpected biosynthetic origins, particularly from poorly studied species. This result establishes the HEx platform for rapid discovery of natural products from any fungal species, even those that are uncultivable, and opens the door to discovery of the next generation of natural products.\\n\\nSummaryHere we present the largest scale effort reported to date toward the complete refactoring and heterologous expression of fungal biosynthetic gene clusters utilizing HEx, a novel synthetic biology platform.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models are nowadays important tools for analyzing dynamics of cellular processes. The unknown model parameters are usually estimated from experimental data. These data often only provide information about the relative changes between conditions, hence, the observables contain scaling parameters. The unknown scaling parameters and corresponding noise parameters have to be inferred along with the dynamic parameters. The nuisance parameters often increase the dimensionality of the estimation problem substantially and cause convergence problems. In this manuscript, we propose a hierarchical optimization approach for estimating the parameters for ordinary differential equation (ODE) models from relative data. Our approach restructures the optimization problem into an inner and outer subproblem. These subproblems possess lower dimensions than the original optimization problem, and the inner problem can be solved analytically. We evaluated accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency of the hierarchical approach by studying three signaling pathways. The proposed approach achieved better convergence than the standard approach and required a lower computation time. As the hierarchical optimization approach is widely applicable, it provides a powerful alternative to established approaches.",

    "abstract": "Geothermal springs are model ecosystems to systematically investigate microbial biogeography as they i) represent discrete, homogenous habitats; ii) are abundantly distributed across multiple geographical scales; iii) span broad geochemical gradients; and iv) have simple community structures with reduced metazoan interactions. Taking advantage of these traits, we undertook the largest known consolidated study of geothermal ecosystems (http://1000springs.org.nz) to determine factors that influence biogeographical patterns. Rigorously standardised methodologies were used to measure microbial communities, 46 physicochemical parameters, and metadata from 1,019 hotspring samples across New Zealand. pH was found to be the primary influence on diversity in springs < 70 {degrees}C with community similarity decreasing with geographic distance. Surprisingly, community composition was dominated by two genera (Venenivibrio and Acidithiobacillus) in both average relative abundance (11.2 and 11.1 %) and prevalence (74.2 and 62.9 % respectively) across physicochemical spectrums of 13.9 - 100.6 {degrees}C and pH < 1 - 9.7. This study provides an unprecedented insight into the ecological conditions that drive community assembly in geothermal springs, and can be used as a foundation to improve the characterisation of global microbial biogeographical processes.",

A motivating application is to characterize the perturbation of DNA copy number alterations (CNA) on downstream protein levels in tumors. Through a penalized multivariate regression framework, spaceMap jointly models high dimensional protein levels as responses and high dimensional CNA as predictors. In this setup, spaceMap infers an undirected network among proteins together with a directed network encoding how CNA perturb the protein network. spaceMap can be applied to learn other types of regulatory relationships from high dimensional molecular pro-files, especially those exhibiting hub structures.\\n\\nResultsSimulation studies show spaceMap has greater power in detecting regulatory relationships over competing methods. Additionally, spaceMap includes a network analysis toolkit for biological interpretation of inferred networks. We applied spaceMap to the CNA, gene expression and proteomics data sets from CPTAC-TCGA breast (n=77) and ovarian (n=174) cancer studies. Each cancer exhibited disruption of  ion transmembrane transport and  regulation from RNA polymerase II promoter by CNA events unique to each cancer. Moreover, using protein levels as a response yields a more functionally-enriched network than using RNA expressions in both cancer types. The network results also help to pinpoint crucial cancer genes and provide insights on the functional consequences of important CNA in breast and ovarian cancers.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe R package spaceMap -- including vignettes and documentation -- is hosted at https://topherconley.github.io/spacemap",

    "abstract": "Meiotically driving sex chromosomes manipulate gametogenesis to increase their transmission at a cost to the rest of the genome. The intragenomic conflicts they produce have major impacts on the ecology and evolution of their host species. However their ecological dynamics remain poorly understood. Simple population genetic models predict meiotic drivers will rapidly reach fixation in a population and spread across a landscape. In contrast, natural populations commonly show spatial variation in the frequency of drivers, with drive present in clines or mosaics across species ranges. For example, Drosophila subobscura harbours a Sex Ratio distorting drive chromosome (\\\"SRs\\\") at 15-25% frequency in North Africa, present at less than 2% frequency in adjacent Southern Spain and absent in other European populations. Here, we investigate the forces preventing the spread of the driver northward. We show that SRs has remained at a constant frequency in North Africa, and failed to spread in Spain. We find strong evidence in favour of our first hypothesis, genetic incompatibility between SRs and Spanish autosomal background. When we cross SRs from North Africa onto Spanish genetic backgrounds we observe strong SRs specific incompatibilities in hybrids. The incompatibilities increase in severity in F2 male hybrids, leading to almost complete infertility. We find no evidence supporting a second hypothesis, that there is resistance to drive in Spanish populations. We conclude that the source of the stepped frequency variation is genetic incompatibility between the SRs chromosome and the genetic backgrounds of the adjacent population, preventing SRs spreading northward. The low frequency of SRs in South Spain is consistent with recurrent gene flow across the Strait of Gibraltar combined with selection against the SRs element through genetic incompatibility. This demonstrates that incompatibilities between drive chromosomes and naive populations can prevent the spread of drive between populations, at a continental scale.",

    "abstract": "Exome sequencing is a powerful tool for detecting both single and multiple nucleotide variation genome wide. However long indels, in the size range 20 - 200bp, remain difficult to accurately detect. By assessing a set of common exonic long indels, we estimate the sensitivity of long indel detection in exome sequencing data to be 92%. To clarify the role of pathogenic long indels in patients with intellectual disability (ID), we analysed exome sequencing data from 820 patients using two variant callers, Pindel and Platypus. We identified three indels explaining the patients clinical phenotype by disrupting the UBE3A, PGAP3 and MECP2 genes. Comparison of different tools demonstrated the importance of both correct genotyping and annotation variants. In conclusion, specialized long indel detection can improve diagnostic yield in ID patients.",

    "abstract": "Resting state networks measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) form transiently stable spatio-temporal patterns in the subsecond range, and therefore fluctuate more rapidly than previously appreciated. These states populate and interact across the whole brain, are simple to record, and possess the same dynamic structure of task related changes. They therefore provide a generic, heterogeneous, and plentiful functional substrate against which to test different MEG recording and reconstruction approaches. Here we validate a non-invasive method for quantifying the resolution of different inversion assumptions under different recording regimes (with and without head-casts) based on resting state MEG. Spatio-temporally partitioning of data into self-similar periods confirmed a rich and rapidly dynamic temporal structure with a small number of regularly reoccurring states. To test the anatomical precision that could be resolved through these transient states we then inverted these data onto libraries of systematically distorted, subject specific, cortical meshes and compared the quality of the fit using Cross Validation and a Free Energy metric. This revealed which inversion scheme was able to best support the least distorted (most accurate) anatomical models. Both datasets showed an increase in model fit as anatomical models moved towards the true cortical surface. In the head-cast MEG data, the Empirical Bayesian Beamformer (EBB) algorithm showed the best mean anatomical discrimination (3.7 mm) compared with Minimum Norm / LORETA (6.0 mm) and Multiple Sparse priors (9.4 mm). This pattern was replicated in the second (conventional dataset) although with a marginally poorer prediction of the missing (cross-validated) data. Our findings suggest that the abundant resting state data now commonly available could be used to refine and validate MEG source reconstruction methods or recording paradigms.",

We determined whether seasonal phenotypic plasticity in evaporative cooling capacity at high temperatures explained how the range-restricted Cape Rockjumper (Chaetops frenatus; hereafter \\\"Rockjumper\\\"), copes with hot and dry summer temperatures of the temperate mountain peaks of southwest South Africa. We measured evaporative water loss (EWL), resting metabolic rate (RMR), and body temperature (Tb) at high air temperatures (30 to 42{degrees}C) of individuals from a wild population of Rockjumpers during winter and summer (n = 11 winter, 4 females, 7 males; n = 10 summer, 6 females, 4 males). We found Rockjumper evaporative cooling in summer imposes higher EWL (i.e. greater water costs) compared to winter, although an accompanying lack of change in RMR resulted in increased summer cooling efficiency. These patterns are similar to those observed in species that inhabit regions where summer temperatures are routinely hot but not water stressed. Our findings show that avian seasonal physiological adjustments to heat can be diverse. Further seasonal studies on thermoregulation in the heat will greatly improve our knowledge of the functional value traits such as evaporative cooling efficiency and heat tolerance hold and how they contribute to the physiological stress organisms experience in heterogenous environments.",

    "abstract": "Consumer genomics enables genetic discovery on an unprecedented scale by linking very large databases of personal genomic data with phenotype information voluntarily submitted via web-based surveys1. These databases are having a transformative effect on human genomic research, yielding insights on increasingly complex traits, behaviors, and disease by including many thousands of individuals in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)2, 3. The promise of consumer genomic data is not limited to human research, however. Genomic tools for dogs are readily available, with hundreds of causal Mendelian variants already characterized4-6, because selection and breeding have led to dramatic phenotypic diversity underlain by a simple genetic structure7, 8. Here, we report the results of the first consumer genomics study ever conducted in a non-human model: a GWAS of blue eyes based on more than 3,000 customer dogs with a validation panel of nearly 3,000 more, the largest canine GWAS to date. We discovered a novel association with blue eyes on chromosome 18 (P = 1x10-65) and used both sequence coverage and microarray probe intensity data to identify the putative causal variant: a 98.6-kb duplication directly upstream of the hox gene ALX4, which plays an important role in mammalian eye development9, 10. This duplication was largely restricted to Siberian Huskies and is highly, but not completely, penetrant. These results underscore the power of consumer-data-driven discovery in nonhuman species, especially dogs, where there is intense owner interest in the personal genomic information of their pets, a high level of engagement with web-based surveys, and an underlying genetic architecture ideal for mapping studies.",

These projections rarely account for how temporal variation in temperature can systematically modify growth rates relative to projections based on constant temperatures. Here, we tested the hypothesis that population growth rates in fluctuating thermal environments differ from growth rates in constant conditions, and that the differing thermal performance curves (TPCs) can be predicted quantitatively. With experimental populations of the green alga Tetraselmis tetrahele, we show that nonlinear averaging techniques accurately predicted increased as well as decreased population growth rates in fluctuating thermal regimes relative to constant thermal regimes. We extrapolate from these results to project critical temperatures for population growth and persistence of 89 phytoplankton species in naturally variable thermal environments.

    "abstract": "The risk of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) comprises both genetic and environmental components. We investigated whether genetic susceptibility to T1D could be mediated by changes in DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism that potentially plays a role in autoimmune diabetes. Using data from a non-diabetic population comprising blood samples taken at birth (n=844), childhood (n=911) and adolescence (n=907), we evaluated the associations between 65 top GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genome-wide DNA methylation levels. We identified 159 proximal SNP-cytosine phosphate guanine (CpG) pairs (cis), and 7 distal SNP-CpG associations (trans) at birth, childhood, and adolescence. There was also a systematic enrichment for methylation related SNPs to be associated with T1D across the genome, after controlling for genomic characteristics of the SNPs, implying that methylation could either be on the causal pathway to T1D or a non-causal biomarker. Combining the principles of Mendelian Randomization and genetic colocalization analysis, we provided evidence that at 5 loci, ITGB3BP, AFF3, PTPN2, CTSH and CTLA4, DNA methylation is potentially on the causal pathway to T1D.",

    "abstract": "Genetic resistance is the most economic and environmentally sustainable approach for crop disease protection. Disease resistance (R) genes from wild relatives are a valuable resource for breeding resistant crops. However, introgression of R genes into crops is a lengthy process often associated with co-integration of deleterious linked genes1, 2 and pathogens can rapidly evolve to overcome R genes when deployed singly3. Introducing multiple cloned R genes into crops as a stack would avoid linkage drag and delay emergence of resistance-breaking pathogen races4. However, current R gene cloning methods require segregating or mutant progenies5-10, which are difficult to generate for many wild relatives due to poor agronomic traits. We exploited natural pan-genome variation in a wild diploid wheat by combining association genetics with R gene enrichment sequencing (AgRenSeq) to clone four stem rust resistance genes in <6 months. RenSeq combined with diversity panels is therefore a major advance in isolating R genes for engineering broad-spectrum resistance in crops.",

    "abstract": "Emotional experiences are typically remembered with a greater sense of recollection than neutral experiences, but memory benefits for emotional items do not typically extend to their source contexts. Item and source memory have been attributed to different subregions of the medial temporal lobes (MTL), but it is unclear how emotional item recollection fits into existing models of MTL function and, in particular, what is the role of the hippocampus. To address these issues, we used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine MTL contributions to successful emotional item and context encoding. The results showed that emotional items were recollected more often than neutral items. Whereas amygdala and perirhinal cortex (PRC) activity supported the recollection advantage for emotional items, hippocampal and parahippocampal cortex activity predicted subsequent source memory for both types of items, reflecting a double dissociation between anterior and posterior MTL regions. In addition, amygdala activity during encoding modulated the relationships of PRC activity and hippocampal activity to subsequent item recollection and source memory, respectively. Specifically, whereas PRC activity best predicted subsequent item recollection when amygdala activity was relatively low, hippocampal activity best predicted source memory when amygdala activity was relatively high. We interpret these findings in terms of complementary compared to synergistic amygdala-MTL interactions. The results suggest that emotion-related enhancements in item recollection are supported by an amygdala-PRC pathway, which is separable from the hippocampal pathway that binds items to their source context.",

Here, C. elegans with internalized paramagnetic nanoparticles were placed inside magnetic field to explore effects on locomotion.

To test our hypothesis, we used young adult C. elegans fed on bacteria mixed with paramagnetic nanoparticles of 1 m, 100 nm and 40 nm diameter. The presence of nanoparticles inside the worms body (alimentary canal, body muscle) was verified by fluorescent and electron microscopy.

Current algorithms typically define a growth process with parameters that allow matching aspects of the morphologies. However, such algorithmic growth processes are far simpler than the biological ones. What is needed is an algorithm that, given a database of morphologies, produces more of those. Here, we introduce a generator for neuron morphologies that is based on a statistical sampling process. Our Reversible Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) method starts with a trivial neuron and iteratively perturbs the morphology bringing the features close to those of the database. By quantifying the statistics of the generated neurons, we find that it outperforms growth-based models for many features. Good generative models for neuron morphologies promise to be important both for neural simulations and for morphology reconstructions from imaging data.",

    "abstract": "Measurements of response time (RT) have long been used to infer neural processes underlying various cognitive functions such as working memory, attention, and decision making. However, it is currently unknown if RT is also informative about various stages of value-based choice, particularly how reward values are constructed. To investigate these questions, we analyzed the pattern of RT during a set of multi-dimensional learning and decision-making tasks that can prompt subjects to adopt different learning strategies. In our experiments, subjects could use reward feedback to directly learn reward values associated with possible choice options (object-based learning). Alternatively, they could learn reward values of options features (e.g. color, shape) and combine these values to estimate reward values for individual options (feature-based learning). We found that RT was slower when the difference between subjects estimates of reward probabilities for the two alternative objects on a given trial was smaller. Moreover, RT was overall faster when the preceding trial was rewarded or when the previously selected object was present. These effects, however, were mediated by an interaction between these factors such that subjects were faster when the previously selected object was present rather than absent but only after unrewarded trials. Finally, RT reflected the learning strategy (i.e. object-based or feature-based approach) adopted by the subject on a trial-by-trial basis, indicating an overall faster construction of reward value and/or value comparison during object-based learning. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the pattern of RT can be informative about how reward values are learned and constructed during complex value-based learning and decision making.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal epithelium is a single layer of cells which provides the first line of defence of the intestinal mucosa to bacterial infection. Cohesion of this physical barrier is supported by renewal of epithelial stem cells, residing in invaginations called crypts, and by crypt cell migration onto protrusions called villi; dysregulation of such mechanism may render the gut susceptible to chronic inflammation. The impact that excessive or misplaced epithelial cell death may have on villus cell migration is currently unknown. We integrated cell-tracking methods with computational models to determine how epithelial homeostasis is affected by acute and chronic inflammatory cell death. Parameter inference reveals that acute inflammatory cell death has a transient effect on epithelial cell dynamics, whereas cell death caused by chronic inflammation causes a delay in the accumulation of labelled cells onto the villus compared to control. Such a delay may be reproduced by using a cell-based model to simulate the dynamics of each cell in a crypt-villus geometry, showing that a prolonged increase in cell death slows the migration of cells from the crypt to the villus. This investigation highlights which injuries (acute or chronic) may be regenerated and which cause disruption of healthy epithelial homeostasis.",

In higher eukaryotes, dynein/dynactin requires additional components such as Bicaudal D to form an active motor complex and for regulating its cellular localization. Spindly is a protein that targets dynein/dynactin to kinetochores in mitosis and can activate its motility in vitro. However, no role for Spindly in interphase dynein/dynactin function has been found. We show that Spindly binds to the cell cortex and microtubule tips and colocalizes with dynein/dynactin at the leading edge of migrating U2OS cells and primary fibroblasts. U2OS cells that lack Spindly migrated slower in 2D than control cells, although centrosome polarization appeared to happen properly in the absence of Spindly. Re-expression of Spindly rescues migration, but the expression of a mutant, which is defective for dynactin binding, failed to rescue this defect. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Spindly plays an important role in mediating a subset of dynein/dynactins function in cell migration.",
