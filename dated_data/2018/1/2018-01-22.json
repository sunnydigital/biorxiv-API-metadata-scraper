    "abstract": "Modern scientific studies from many diverse areas of research abound with multiple hypothesis testing concerns. The false discovery rate is one of the most commonly used error rates for measuring and controlling rates of false discoveries when performing multiple tests. Adaptive false discovery rates rely on an estimate of the proportion of null hypotheses among all the hypotheses being tested. This proportion is typically estimated once for each collection of hypotheses. Here we propose a regression framework to estimate the proportion of null hypotheses conditional on observed covariates. This may then be used as a multiplication factor with the Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values, leading to a plug-in false discovery rate estimator. Our case study concerns a genome-wise association meta-analysis which considers associations with body mass index. In our framework, we are able to use the sample sizes for the individual genomic loci and the minor allele frequencies as covariates. We further evaluate our approach via a number of simulation scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences in the human brain are of interest, for example because of sex differences in the observed prevalence of psychiatric disorders and in some psychological traits. We report the largest single-sample study of structural and functional sex differences in the human brain (2,750 female, 2,466 male participants; 44-77 years). Males had higher volumes, surface areas, and white matter fractional anisotropy; females had thicker cortices and higher white matter tract complexity. There was considerable distributional overlap between the sexes. Subregional differences were not fully attributable to differences in total volume or height. There was generally greater male variance across structural measures. Functional connectome organization showed stronger connectivity for males in unimodal sensorimotor cortices, and stronger connectivity for females in the default mode network. This large-scale study provides a foundation for attempts to understand the causes and consequences of sex differences in adult brain structure and function.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive theories suggest that working memory maintains not only the identity of recently-presented stimuli but also a sense of the elapsed time since the stimuli presentation. Previous studies of the neural underpinnings of working memory have focused on sustained firing, which can account for maintenance of the stimulus identity, but not for representation of the elapsed time. We analyzed single-unit recordings from the macaque lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) during performance of a delayed-match-to-category task. The sample stimulus triggered a consistent sequence of neurons, each neuron in the sequence firing during a circumscribed period of time. The sequences initiated by different sample stimuli were distinct but overlapping, with the degree of overlap reflecting the visual similarity of the stimuli that caused the sequences. These sequences of neurons encoded both stimulus identity and the elapsed time. The temporal code became less precise as the sample stimulus receded into the past. These findings suggest that working memory is maintained as a compressed timeline, consistent with longstanding cognitive theories of human memory.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of hybridization and gene flow among closely related taxa is a common goal for researchers studying speciation and phylogeography. Many methods for hybridization detection use simple site pattern frequencies from observed genomic data and compare them to null models that predict an absence of gene flow. The theory underlying the detection of hybridization using these site pattern probabilities exploits the relationship between the coalescent process for gene trees within population trees and the process of mutation along the branches of the gene trees. For certain models, site patterns are predicted to occur in equal frequency (i.e., their difference is 0), producing a set of functions called phylogenetic invariants. In this paper we introduce HyDe, a software package for detecting hybridization using phylogenetic invariants arising under the coalescent model with hybridization. HyDe is written in Python, and can be used interactively or through the command line using pre-packaged scripts. We demonstrate the use of HyDe on simulated data, as well as on two empirical data sets from the literature. We focus in particular on identifying individual hybrids within population samples and on distinguishing between hybrid speciation and gene flow. HyDe is freely available as an open source Python package under the GNU GPL v3 on both GitHub (https://github.com/pblischak/HyDe) and the Python Package Index (PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/phyde).",

This study aimed to provide better experimental evidence of such manifestations in animal models.\\n\\nDesignNOD/SCID/JAK3null (NOJ) mice were transplanted with human cord-derived CD34+ cells with or without transduction with a lentiviral vector expressing a promoter-targeting shRNA called PromA.\\n\\nMethodsAt 16 weeks after transplantation, mice engrafted with CD34+ cells were infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1JRFL.\\n\\nResultsAt week 2 post infection, HIV replication was observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and splenocytes. In mice transplanted with unmanipulated CD34+ cells, viral replication was accompanied by a loss of peripheral/spleen CD4+CCR5+ T cells. Interestingly, bone marrow CD34+ cells in HIV-infected mice were also depleted, but in a CXCR4-associated manner. Conversely, the lentiviral transfer of PromA in CD34+ cells prior to transplantation rendered the humanized NOJ mice resistant to HIV replication in CD4+ T cells, resulting in better preservation of peripheral/spleen CD4+CCR5+ T cells and bone marrow CD34+ cells at two weeks after infection.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results implicate the importance of evaluating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell pools in addition to peripheral CD4+ T-cell counts to assess the early stage of HIV infection. Moreover, stable gene transfer of PromA to hematopoietic stem cells not only limited HIV replication but also led to preservation of different subsets of hematopoietic cells, including bone marrow stem/progenitor cells.",

    "abstract": "Streptomycetes are filamentous bacteria that differentiate by producing spore-bearing reproductive structures called aerial hyphae. The transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is controlled by the bld (bald) loci, and mutations in bld genes prevent the formation of aerial hyphae, either by blocking entry into development (typically mutations in activators) or by inducing precocious sporulation in the vegetative mycelium (typically mutations in repressors). One of the bld genes, bldC, encodes a 68-residue DNA-binding protein related to the DNA-binding domain of MerR-family transcription factors. Recent work has shown that BldC binds DNA by a novel mechanism, but there is less insight into its impact on Streptomyces development. Here we used ChIP-seq coupled with RNA-seq to define the BldC regulon in the model species Streptomyces venezuelae, showing that BldC can function both as a repressor and as an activator of transcription. Using electron microscopy and time-lapse imaging, we show that bldC mutants are bald because they initiate development prematurely, bypassing the formation of aerial hyphae. This is consistent with the premature expression of BldC target genes encoding proteins with key roles in development (e.g. whiD, whiI, sigF), chromosome condensation and segregation (e.g. smeA-sffA, hupS), and sporulation-specific cell division (e.g. dynAB), suggesting that BldC-mediated repression is critical to maintain a sustained period of vegetative growth prior to sporulation. We discuss the possible significance of BldC as an evolutionary link between MerR family transcription factors and DNA architectural proteins.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEUnderstanding the mechanisms that drive bacterial morphogenesis depends on the dissection of the regulatory networks that underpin the cell biological processes involved. Recently, Streptomyces venezuelae has emerged as an attractive new model system for the study of morphological differentiation in Streptomyces. This has led to significant progress in identifying the genes controlled by the transcription factors that regulate aerial mycelium formation (Bld regulators) and sporulation (Whi regulators). Taking advantage of S. venezuelae, we used ChIP-seq coupled with RNA-seq to identify the genes directly under the control of BldC. Because S. venezuelae sporulates in liquid culture, the complete spore-to-spore life cycle can be examined using time-lapse microscopy, and we applied this technique to the bldC mutant. These combined approaches reveal BldC to be a member of an emerging class of Bld regulators that function principally to repress key sporulation genes, thereby extending vegetative growth and blocking the onset of morphological differentiation.",

    "abstract": "We investigated how artificial tactile feedback in the form of a skin-stretch affects perception of stiffness and grip force adjustment. During interactions with objects, information from kinesthetic and tactile sensors is used to estimate the forces acting on the limbs. These enable the perception of the mechanical properties of objects to form, and the creation of internal models to predict the consequences of interactions with these objects, such as feedforward grip-force adjustments to prevent slippage. Previous studies showed that an artificial stretch of the skin of the fingertips can produce a linear additive effect on stiffness perception, but it remains unclear how such stretch affects the control of grip force. Here, we used a robotic device and a custom-built skin-stretch device to manipulate kinesthetic and tactile information. Using a stiffness discrimination task, we found that adding artificial tactile feedback to a kinesthetic force can create the illusion of touching a harder spring which affects both perception and action. The magnitude of the illusion is linearly related to the amplitude of the applied stretch. We also isolated the contribution of tactile stimulation to the predictive and reactive components of grip force adjustment, and found that unlike in other cases of perceptual illusions, the predictive grip force is modulated consistently with the perceptual tactile-induced illusion. These results have major implications for the design of tactile interfaces across a variety of touch applications such as wearable haptic devices, teleoperations, robot-assisted surgery, and prosthetics.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSensing forces, using kinesthetic and tactile modalities, is important for assessing the mechanical properties of objects, and for acting the objects while stabilizing grasp against slippage. A major challenge in understanding the internal representations that allow for a predictive grip force control during contact with objects is to dissociate the contribution of tactile and kinesthetic stimuli. To date, this contribution was investigated only in impaired cases either through local anesthesia or in patients with sensory impairment. Our study demonstrates using a programmable mechatronic device that artificially applied skin-stretch creates an illusion of a greater load force that affects grip force control and stiffness perception. These results are applicable in tactile technologies for wearable haptic devices, teleoperation, robot-assisted surgery, and prosthetics.",

    "abstract": "Auditory signals arrive at the ear as a mixture that the brain must decompose into distinct sources, based to a large extent on acoustic properties of the sounds. An important question concerns whether listeners have voluntary control over how many sources they perceive. This has been studied using pure tones H and L presented in the repeating pattern HLH-HLH-, which can form a bistable percept, heard either as an integrated whole (HLH-) or as segregated into high (H-H-) and low (-L--) sequences. Although instructing listeners to try to integrate or segregate sounds affects reports of what they hear, this could reflect a response bias rather than a perceptual effect. We had human listeners (15 males, 12 females) continuously report their perception of such sequences and recorded neural activity using magneto-encephalography. During neutral listening, a classifier trained on patterns of neural activity distinguished between periods of integrated and segregated perception. In other conditions, participants tried to influence their perception by allocating attention either to the whole sequence, or to a subset of the sounds. They reported hearing the desired percept for a greater proportion of time than when listening neutrally. Critically, neural activity supported these reports; stimulus-locked brain responses in auditory cortex were more likely to resemble the signature of segregation when participants tried to hear segregation than when attempting to perceive integration. These results indicate that listeners can influence how many sound sources they perceive, as reflected in neural responses that track both the input and its perceptual organization.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCan we consciously influence our perception of the external world? We address this question using sound sequences that can be heard either as coming from a single source, or as two distinct auditory streams. Listeners reported spontaneous changes in their perception between these two interpretations while we recorded neural activity to identify signatures of such integration and segregation. They also indicated that they could, to some extent, choose between these alternatives. This claim was supported by corresponding changes in responses in auditory cortex. By linking neural and behavioral correlates of perception we demonstrate that the number of objects we perceive can depend not only on the physical attributes of our environment, but also on how we intend to experience it.",

    "abstract": "Influenza virus can completely escape most antibodies with single mutations. However, rare antibodies broadly neutralize many viral strains. It is unclear how easily influenza virus might escape such antibodies if it was under strong pressure to do so. Here we map all single amino-acid mutations that increase resistance to broad antibodies targeting an H1 hemagglutinin. Crucially, our approach not only identifies antigenic mutations but also quantifies their effect sizes. All antibodies select mutations, but the effect sizes vary widely. The virus can escape a broad antibody that targets residues in hemagglutinins receptor-binding site the same way it escapes narrow strain-specific antibodies: via single mutations with huge effects. In contrast, broad antibodies targeting hemagglutinins stalk only select mutations with small effects. Therefore, among the antibodies we have examined, breadth is an imperfect indicator of the potential for viral escape via single mutations. Broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the H1 hemagglutinin stalk are quantifiably harder to escape than the other antibodies tested here.",

    "abstract": "Sensory neurons innervating the dental pulp have unique morphological and functional characteristics compared to neurons innervating other tissues. Stimulation of dental pulp afferents whatever the modality or intensity of the stimulus, even light mechanical stimulation that would not activate nociceptors in other tissues, produces an intense pain. These specific sensory characteristics could involve receptors of the Transient Receptor Potential channels (TRP) family. In this study, we evaluated 1) the expression of TRPA1 and TRPM8 receptors in trigeminal ganglion neurons innervating the dental pulp compared to sensory neurons innervating the oral mucosa or the skin of the face, and 2) the involvement of these receptors in dental pulp sensitivity to cold stimulation. We showed a similar expression of TRPM8 and CGRP in sensory neurons innervating the dental pulp, the skin or the oral mucosa. However, the proportion of neurons expressing TRPA1 was higher in the neuronal population innervating the mucosa (43%) than in the neuronal population innervating the dental pulp (19%) or the skin (24%). Moreover, neurons innervating the dental pulp had a higher proportion of large neurons (24%) compared to neurons innervating the skin (8%) or the mucosa (10%). The evaluation of the relation between TRPM8, TRPA1 and cold stimulation in trigeminal ganglion neuron culture, showed that a significant proportion of neurons innervating the skin (10%) or the mucosa (37%) were sensitive to cold stimulation but insensitive to TRPM8 and TRPA1 activation, indicating that perception of stimuli would be in part independent to TRPA1 and TRPM8 receptors. Similarly, the application of a cold stimulation on the tooth induced an overexpression of cFos in the trigeminal nucleus that was not prevented by administration of a TRPA1 antagonist or the genetic deletion of TRPM8. However, the pretreatment with the local anesthetic carbocaine abolish the cold-induced cFos overexpression. In conclusion, the unique sensory characteristics of the dental pulp would be independent to TRPA1 and TRPM8 expression and functionality.",

    "abstract": "K562 is widely used in biomedical research. It is one of three tier-one cell lines of ENCODE and also most commonly used for large-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screens. Although its functional genomic and epigenomic characteristics have been extensively studied, its genome sequence and genomic structural features have never been comprehensively analyzed. Such information is essential for the correct interpretation and understanding of the vast troves of existing functional genomics and epigenomics data for K562. We performed and integrated deep-coverage whole-genome (short-insert), mate-pair, and linked-read sequencing as well as karyotyping and array CGH analysis to identify a wide spectrum of genome characteristics in K562: copy numbers (CN) of aneuploid chromosome segments at high-resolution, SNVs and Indels (both corrected for CN in aneuploid regions), loss of heterozygosity, mega-base-scale phased haplotypes often spanning entire chromosome arms, structural variants (SVs) including small and large-scale complex SVs and non-reference retrotransposon insertions. Many SVs were phased, assembled, and experimentally validated. We identified multiple allele-specific deletions and duplications within the tumor suppressor gene FHIT. Taking aneuploidy into account, we re-analyzed K562 RNA-seq and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data for allele-specific expression and allele-specific DNA methylation. We also show examples of how deeper insights into regulatory complexity are gained by integrating genomic variant information and structural context with functional genomics and epigenomics data. Furthermore, using K562 haplotype information, we produced an allele-specific CRISPR targeting map. This comprehensive whole-genome analysis serves as a resource for future studies that utilize K562 as well as a framework for the analysis of other cancer genomes.",

    "abstract": "The ventral striatum (VS) is a central node within a distributed network that controls appetitive behavior, and neuromodulation of the VS has demonstrated therapeutic potential for appetitive disorders. Local field potential (LFP) oscillations recorded from deep brain stimulation electrodes within the VS are a pragmatic source of neural systems-level information about appetitive behavior that could be used in responsive neuromodulation systems. Here, we recorded LFPs from the bilateral nucleus accumbens core and shell (subregions of the VS) during limited access to palatable food across varying conditions of hunger and food palatability in male rats. We used standard statistical methods (logistic regression) as well as the machine learning algorithm lasso to predict aspects of feeding behavior using VS LFPs. These models were able to predict the amount of food eaten, the increase in consumption following food deprivation, and the type of food eaten. Further, we were able to predict whether the initiation of feeding was imminent up to 42.5 seconds before feeding began and classify current behavior as either feeding or not-feeding. In classifying this behavior, we found an optimal balance between model complexity and performance with models using 3 LFP features primarily from the alpha and high gamma frequencies. As shown here, unbiased methods can identify systems-level neural activity linked to symptoms of mental illness with potential application to the development and personalization of novel treatments.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAs neuropsychiatry begins to leverage the power of computational methods to understand disease states and to develop better therapies, it is vital that we acknowledge the trade-offs between model complexity and performance. We show that computational methods can elucidate a neural signature of feeding behavior and show how these methods could be used to discover neural patterns related to other behaviors and used as therapeutic targets. Further, our results helps to contextualize both the limitations and potential of applying computational methods to neuropsychiatry by showing how changing the data being used to train predictive models (e.g., population vs. individual data) can have a large impact on how model performance generalizes across time, internal states and individuals.",

    "abstract": "Streptomycetes constitute the largest genus of actinobacteria, living predominantly in soil and decaying vegetation. The bacteria are widely known for their filamentous morphologies and their capacity to synthesize antibiotics and other biologically active molecules. More than a decade ago, we and others identified 22 genomic islands that Streptomyces coelicolor M145 possesses and other Streptomyces strains lack. One of these genomic islands, Genomic Island (GI) 6, encodes an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor that we were characterizing in separate work. Here we report that artificial induction of the ECF sigma factor, which is encoded by SCO3450, causes the transcription of approximately one-fourth of GI 6, or ~26 mostly contiguous genes, to increase. More than half of the regulon encodes putative enzymes involved in small molecule metabolism. A putative haloacid dehalogenase is present. Genes encoding two putative anti-sigma factors flank SCO3450, the three genes residing within the regulon. Our data suggest that the ECF sigma factor and its regulon are a self-contained transcriptional unit that can be transferred by horizontal gene transfer. To our knowledge, only one other example has been identified of an ECF sigma factor and its contiguous regulon appearing to be transferrable by horizontal gene transfer [18,19]. Because the regulon appears not to be induced by the 44 growth conditions recently examined by Byung-Kwan Cho and colleagues [20], if it confers fitness to S. coelicolor, the regulon likely does so in as-yet unknown situations. Those situations might range from scavenging to detoxification to even communication within microbial communities.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEStreptomyces bacteria grow as hyphae that colonize soil and differentiate into spores when nutrients become scarce. In their terrestrial habitats, the bacteria encounter diverse conditions. Presumably so that the bacteria can cope with those conditions, the chromosomes of streptomycetes are highly dynamic, varying greatly in structure not only between species but also between closely related strains of a single species. The bacteria also have large numbers of extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors, which undoubtedly help the microorganisms respond to the plethora of challenges coming from the environment. This work illustrates these two threads of Streptomyces biology dovetailing: Genetic adaptability through horizontal gene transfer seems to have enabled Streptomyces coelicolor to acquire a self-contained transcriptional unit that consists of an ECF sigma factor and its regulon. The suggested facile movement of the regulon between microbial hosts indicates the value of the metabolism of small molecules possibly mediated by the regulon.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSimulating genome sequence data with features can facilitate the development and benchmarking of structural variant analysis programs. However, there are a limited number of data simulators that provide structural variants in silico. Moreover, there are a paucity of programs that generate structural variants with different allelic fraction and haplotypes.\\n\\nFindingsWe developed SVEngine, an open source tool to address this need. SVEngine simulates next generation sequencing data with embedded structural variations. As input, SVEngine takes template haploid sequences (FASTA) and an external variant file, a variant distribution file and/or a clonal phylogeny tree file (NEWICK) as input. Subsequently, it simulates and outputs sequence contigs (FASTAs), sequence reads (FASTQs) and/or post-alignment files (BAMs). All of the files contain the desired variants, along with BED files containing the ground truth. SVEngines flexible design process enables one to specify size, position, and allelic fraction for deletion, insertion, duplication, inversion and translocation variants. Finally, SVEngine simulates sequence data that replicates the characteristics of a sequencing library with mixed sizes of DNA insert molecules. To improve the compute speed, SVEngine is highly parallelized to reduce the simulation time.\\n\\nConclusionsWe demonstrated the versatile features of SVEngine and its improved runtime comparisons with other available simulators. SVEngines features include the simulation of locus-specific variant frequency designed to mimic the phylogeny of cancer clonal evolution. We validated the accuracy of the simulations. Our evaluation included checking various sequencing mapping features such as coverage change, read clipping, insert size shift and neighbouring hanging read pairs for representative variant types. SVEngine is implemented as a standard Python package and is freely available for academic use at: https://bitbucket.org/charade/svengine.",

    "abstract": "From August to November 2017, Madagascar endured an outbreak of plague. A total of 2417 cases of plague were confirmed, causing a death toll of 209. Public health intervention efforts were introduced and successfully stopped the epidemic at the end of November. The plague, however, is endemic in the region and occurs annually, posing the risk of future outbreaks. To understand on the plague transmission, we collected real-time data from official reports, described the outbreaks characteristics, and estimated transmission parameters using statistical and mathematical models. The pneumonic plague epidemic curve exhibited multiple peaks, coinciding with sporadic introductions of new bubonic cases. Optimal climate conditions for rat flea to flourish were observed during the epidemic. Estimate of the plague basic reproduction number during the large wave of the epidemic was high, ranging from 5-7 depending on model assumptions. The incubation and infection period for bubonic and pneumonic plague were 4.3 and 3.4 days and 3.8 and 2.9, respectively. Parameter estimation suggested that even with a small fraction of the population exposed to infected rat fleas (1/10000) and a small probability of transition from a bubonic case to a secondary pneumonic case (3%), the high human-to-human transmission rate can still generate a large outbreak. Controlling rodent and fleas can prevent new index cases, but managing human-to-human transmission is key to prevent large-scale outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "For cells to grow faster they must increase their protein production rate. Microorganisms have traditionally been thought to accomplish this increase by producing more ribosomes to enhance protein synthesis capacity, leading to the linear relationship between ribosome level and growth rate observed under most growth conditions previously examined. Past studies have suggested that this linear relationship represents an optimal resource allocation strategy for each growth rate, independent of any specific nutrient state. Here we investigate protein production strategies in continuous cultures limited for carbon, nitrogen, and phosphate, which differentially impact substrate supply for protein versus nucleic acid metabolism. Unexpectedly, we find that at slow growth rates, E. coli achieves the same protein production rate using three different strategies under the three different nutrient limitations. Upon phosphate (P) limitation, translation is slow due to a particularly low abundance of ribosomes, which are RNA-rich and thus particularly costly for phosphorous-limited cells. In nitrogen (N) limitation, translation is slowed by limited glutamine and stalling at glutamine codons, resulting is slow elongation. In carbon (C) limitation, translation is slowed by accumulation of inactive ribosomes not bound to mRNA. These extra ribosomes enable rapid growth acceleration upon nutrient upshift. Thus, bacteria tune ribosome usage across different limiting nutrients to enable balanced nutrient-limited growth while also preparing for future nutrient upshifts.",

    "abstract": "The spatiotemporal control of gene expression exerted by promoters and enhancers is central for organismal development, physiology and behaviour. These two types of regulatory elements have long been distinguished from each other based on their function, but recent work highlighted common architectural and functional features. It also suggested that inheritable alterations in the epigenetic and sequence context of regulatory elements might underlie evolutionary changes of their principal activity, which could result in changes in the transcriptional profile of genes under their control or even facilitate the birth of new genes. Here, based on integrated cross-mammalian analyses of DNase hypersensitivity, chromatin modification and transcriptional data, we provide support for this hypothesis by detecting 449 regulatory elements with signatures of activity turnover in sister species from the primate and rodent lineages (termed \\\"P/E\\\" elements). Through the comparison with outgroup species, we defined the directionality of turnover events, which revealed that most instances represent transformations of ancestral enhancers into promoters, leading to the emergence of species-specific transcribed loci or 5 exons. Notably, P/E elements have distinct GC sequence compositions and stabilizing 5 splicing (U1) regulatory motif patterns, which may predispose them to functional repurposing during evolution. Moreover, we trace changes in the U1 and polyadenylation signal densities and distributions that accompanied and likely drove the evolutionary activity switches. Overall, our work suggests rather widespread evolutionary remodelling of regulatory element functions. Functional repurposing thus represents a notable mechanism that likely facilitated regulatory innovation and the origination of new genes and exons during mammalian evolution.",

Here, we describe a novel type of current by using the serotonin transporter (SERT) as a model. We examined transient currents elicited on rapid application of specific SERT inhibitors. Our analysis shows that these currents originate from ligand binding and not from a conformational change. The Gouy-Chapman model predicts that a ligand-induced elimination/neutralization of surface charge must produce a displacement current and related apparent changes in membrane capacitance. Here we verified these predictions with SERT. Our observations demonstrate that ligand binding to a protein can be monitored in real time and in a label-free manner by recording the membrane capacitance.",

The proposed function(s) of HOTAIR lacks consensus as to whether it regulates HoxD cluster genes in trans or HoxC cluster genes in cis. We have identified a 32-nucleotide long conserved noncoding element (CNE) as HOTAIR ancient sequence which has a paralogous copy embedded in HOXD11 noncoding transcript. All vertebrates except teleosts have two copies of CNE and the paralogous CNEs exhibit sequence complementarity in the transcribed orientation. Moreover, paralogous CNEs underwent compensatory mutations suggesting they co-evolved and might hybridize. In both human and mouse, HOTAIR CNE exhibits characteristic features of a poised enhancer in HOTAIR-unexpressed stem cells and of an active enhancer in HOTAIR-expressed cells. Tight correlation between the transcriptional activity of the CNE and HOTAIR promoter suggests HOTAIR transcription is crucial for enhancer activity. In HOTAIR-expressed cells, HOTAIR expression is positively correlated with HOXC11 in cis and negatively correlated with HOXD11 in trans, suggesting a dual modality of HOTAIR ancient sequence.",

Here, we perform Repli-Seq and integrated epigenome analysis and show that early-replicating loci are predisposed to hypermethylation and late-replicating loci to hypomethylation, enrichment of H3K27me3 and concomitant loss of H3K9me3. We find that altered replication timing domains correspond to long-range epigenetically deregulated regions in prostate cancer, and a subset of these domains are remarkably conserved across cancers from different tissue origins. Analyses of 214 prostate and 35 breast cancer genomes reveal that late-replicating DNA is prone to cis and early-replicating DNA to trans chromosomal rearrangements.

It is therefore essential to distinguish the epithelial cells committed to development during this key stage from the related epithelial hierarchy.

The CD49fhighCD24neg cells expressing KRT14, vimentin and PROCR corresponded to basal progenitors whereas the CD49flowCD24neg cells expressing luminal KRT, progesterone and prolactin receptors, were of luminal lineage. The CD49flowCD24pos cells had features of a dual lineage, with luminal and basal characteristics (CD10, ALDH1 and KRT7 expression) and were considered to be early common (bipotent) progenitors. The mammary stem cell (MaSC) fraction was recovered in a fourth sub-population of CD49fhighCD24pos cells that expressed CD10/KRT14 and KRT7. The differential ALDH1 activities observed within the MaSC fraction allowed to discriminate between two states: quiescent MaSCs and lineage-restricted \\\"activated\\\" MaSCs.

    "abstract": "Ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells represent two main lines of photoreceptor evolution in animals. The two photoreceptor-cell types coexist in some animals, however how they functionally integrate is unknown. We used connectomics to map synaptic paths between ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptors in the planktonic larva of the annelid Platynereis and found that ciliary photoreceptors are presynaptic to the rhabdomeric circuit. The behaviors mediated by the ciliary and rhabdomeric cells also interact hierarchically. The ciliary photoreceptors are UV-sensitive and mediate downward swimming to non-directional UV light, a behavior absent in ciliary-opsin knockouts. UV avoidance antagonizes positive phototaxis mediated by the rhabdomeric eyes so that vertical swimming direction is determined by the ratio of blue/UV light. Since this ratio increases with depth, Platynereis larvae may use it as a depth gauge during planktonic migration. Our results revealed a functional integration of ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptors with implications for eye and photoreceptor evolution.",

    "abstract": "To understand neural circuits that control limbs, one must measure their activity during behavior. Until now this goal has been challenging, because the portion of the nervous system that contains limb premotor and motor circuits is largely inaccessible to large-scale recording techniques in intact, moving animals - a constraint that is true for both vertebrate and invertebrate models. Here, we introduce a method for 2-photon functional imaging from the ventral nerve cord of behaving adult Drosophila melanogaster. We use this method to reveal patterns of activity across nerve cord populations during grooming and walking and to uncover the functional encoding of moonwalker ascending neurons (MANs), moonwalker descending neurons (MDNs), and a novel class of locomotion-associated descending neurons. This new approach enables the direct investigation of circuits associated with complex limb movements.",

    "abstract": "In the wild, when to go to sleep is a critical decision. Sleep onset is controlled by two processes: the circadian clock, and a homeostat measuring sleep drive [1, 2]. Environmental stimuli must also clearly intersect with the circadian clock and/or homeostat so that sleep is initiated only when appropriate. Yet how circadian, homeostatic and environmental cues are integrated at the circuit level is unclear. Recently, we found that DN1p clock neurons in Drosophila act to prolong morning wakefulness at elevated ambient temperatures [3]. Here we show that a subset of DN1p neurons exhibit temperature-sensitive increases in excitability, and define an output pathway linking DN1p neurons to downstream sleep-regulatory circuits. We show that DN1p neurons project axons to a subdomain of the Anterior Optic Tubercle (AOTU), and here make inhibitory synaptic connections with sleep-promoting tubercular-bulbar (TuBu) neurons. Using unbiased trans-synaptic labeling, we show that these TuBu neurons form synaptic connections with R-neurons innervating the ellipsoid body, subsets of which control homeostatic sleep drive [4]. DN1p excitability is clock-dependent, peaking in the late night and early morning [5]. Thus, integration of circadian and thermo-sensory information by DN1p neurons and subsequent inhibition of sleep-promoting TuBu neurons provides a mechanism by which an environmental stimulus can regulate sleep onset during a specific compartment of the day-night cycle. Furthermore, our results suggest that the AOTU functionally links circadian and sleep homeostat circuits in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesAcademic and not-for-profit research funders are increasingly requiring that the research they fund must be published open access, with some insisting on publishing with a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence to allow the broadest possible use. We set out to clarify the open access variants provided by leading medical journals for research in general and industry-funded research in particular, and record the availability of the CC BY licence for commercially funded research.\\n\\nMethodsWe identified medical journals with a 2015 impact factor of at least 15.0 on 24 May 2017, then excluded from the analysis journals that only publish review articles. Between 29 June 2017 and 26 July 2017, we collected information about each journals open access policies from their websites and/or by email contact. We contacted the journals by email again between 6 December 2017 and 2 January 2018 to confirm our findings.\\n\\nResultsThirty-five medical journals publishing original research from 13 publishers were included in the analysis. All 35 journals offered some form of open access with varying embargo periods of up to 12 months. Of these journals, 21 (60%) provided immediate open access with a CC BY licence under certain circumstances (e.g. to specific research funders). Of these 21, 20 only offered a CC BY licence to authors funded by non-commercial organizations and one offered this option to funders who required it.\\n\\nConclusionsMost leading medical journals do not offer to authors reporting commercially funded research an open access licence that allows unrestricted sharing and adaptation of the published material. The journals policies are therefore not aligned with open access declarations and guidelines. Commercial research funders lag behind academic funders in the development of mandatory open access policies, and it is time for them to work with publishers to advance the dissemination of the research they fund.\\n\\nStrengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis manuscript includes a systematic analysis of open access policies of journals with a high impact factor, including society-owned journals, from multiple publishers.\\nC_LIO_LIThe open access policies of all journals analysed were clarified, and confirmation of our findings was received by email from 97% of the contacted journals.\\nC_LIO_LIOpen access policies of the journals and publishers analysed are subject to change, so the information presented here may not be current.\\nC_LIO_LIBy selecting journals with a high impact factor, our analysis does not include prestigious journals from specialized therapy areas and regional or non-English language journals, which may have lower impact factors.\\nC_LIO_LIAlthough our study covers only a small number of journals, extending such a manual analysis to a greater number of journals without loss of detail and verification of all results would be cumbersome and inefficient by relying on traditional analysis tools.\\nC_LI",

Currently, there is a lack of effective treatment modality for functional repair of uterine injury. To address this clinical challenge, this study aimed to develop a chemotactic composite scaffold by incorporating recombinant human stromal cell-derived factor-1 (rhSDF-1) into a silk fibroin-bacterial cellulose (SF-BC) membrane carrier. A rat model of uterine injury was utilized for this study, which was composed of three groups: blank control, implantation with SF-BC only or SF-BC loaded with rhSDF-1. The tissue regeneration efficacy of the three groups were analyzed and compared. The results showed that SF-BC loaded with rhSDF-1 significantly enhanced endometrial regeneration and arteriogenesis of the injured rat uterus, which led to improved pregnancy outcomes, thus indicating much promise for functional uterine repair and regeneration.",

    "abstract": "MotivationShotgun metagenomics is a powerful, high-resolution technique enabling the study of microbial communities in situ. However, species-level resolution is only achieved after a process of \\\"binning\\\" where contigs predicted to originate from the same genome are clustered. Such culture-independent sequencing frequently unearths novel microbes, and so various methods have been devised for reference-free binning. Existing methods, however, suffer from: (1) reliance on human pattern recognition, which is inherently unscalable; (2) requirement for multiple co-assembled metagenomes, which degrades assembly quality due to strain variance; and (3) assumption of prior host genome removal not feasible for non-model hosts. We therefore devised a fully-automated pipeline, termed \\\"Autometa,\\\" to address these issues. Results: Autometa implements a method for taxonomic partitioning of contigs based on predicted protein homology, and this was shown to vastly improve binning in host-associated and complex metagenomes. Autometas method of automated clustering, based on Barnes-Hut Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (BH-tSNE) and DBSCAN, was shown to be highly scalable, outperforming other binning pipelines in complex simulated datasets.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationAutometa is freely available at https://bitbucket.org/jasonckwan/autometa and as a docker image at https://hub.docker.com/r/jasonkwan/autometa under the GNU Affero General Public License 3 (AGPL 3).\\n\\nContactjason.kwan@wisc.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available attached to this article at https://biorxiv.org",

    "abstract": "Data normalization is a crucial step in the gene expression analysis as it ensures the validity of its downstream analyses. Although many metrics have been designed to evaluate the current normalization methods, the different metrics yield inconsistent results.

This consistency has validated the underlying theory that a sucessiful normalization method simultaneously maximizes the number of uniform genes and minimizes the correlation between the expression profiles of gene pairs. This consistency can also be used to analyze the quality of gene expression data. The gene expression data, normalization methods and evaluation metrics used in this study have been included in an R package named NormExpression. NormExpression provides a framework and a fast and simple way for researchers to evaluate methods (particularly some data-driven methods or their own methods) and then select a best one for data normalization in the gene expression analysis.",

In this study, we used two cell lines that express vimentin and keratins 8/18 to study the dynamic behavior of these IFs. We demonstrated that both IF types undergo extensive transport along microtubules. This was an unexpected result as keratin filament remodeling has been described to depend on actin dynamics. We established the role of kinesin-1 in vimentin and keratin IF transport by knocking out KIF5B, the ubiquitous isoform of kinesin-1. Futhermore, we demonstrated that unlike typical membrane cargoes, transport of both types of IFs does not involve kinesin light chains, but requires the presence of the same region of the kinesin-1 tail, suggesting a unified mechanism of IF transport.",

    "abstract": "The species-sorting hypothesis (SSH) states that environmental factors influence local community assembly of metacommunities by selecting for species that are well adapted to the specific conditions of each site. Along environmental gradients, the strength of selection against individuals that are marginally adapted to the local conditions increases towards the extremes of the environment where the climate becomes harsh. In rainfall gradients, the strength of selection by the environment has been proposed to decrease with rainfall. Under this scenario SSH would predict that immigration of individuals from the metacommunity should be restricted into the dry end of the gradient creating a positive relationship between immigration and rainfall. However, if the selection is strong in both ends of the gradient, the restriction should be expected to be in both directions such that the ends behave as independent metacommunities even in the absence of geographical barriers. In this study we used models based on neutral theory to evaluate if SSH can explain the distribution of bird species along a steep rainfall gradient in Colombia. We found a strong positive relationship between immigration rates and precipitation suggesting that the dry forests impose stronger challenges for marginally adapted bird populations. However, a two-metacommunity model separating dry and wet forests was a better fit to the observed data, suggesting that both extremes impose strong selection against immigrants. The switch from the dry forest to the wet forest metacommunities occurred abruptly over a short geographic distance in the absence of any apparent geographic barrier; this apparent threshold occurs where the forest becomes mostly evergreen. The relative number of rare species in dry forest was lower than in wet forests suggesting that the selection against marginally adapted populations is stronger in the dry forests. Overall, our analyses are consistent with SSH at the regional scales, but the rarity analysis suggests that the mechanisms at the local scales are substantially different. Based on these results, we hypothesize that abiotic (climatic) factors limit immigration into dry forest communities and whereas biotic factors such as competition and predation may limit immigration into bird communities in the wet forest.",

    "abstract": "Ecuador has the worlds highest biodiversity, despite being a tiny fraction of the worlds land area. The threat of extinction for much of this biodiversity has dramatically increased since April 2016, during which time the Ecuadorian government has opened approximately 2.9 million hectares of land for mining exploration, with many of the concessions in previously protected forests. Herein, we describe the system of protected lands in Ecuador, their mining laws, and outline the scale of threat by comparing the mammals, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and orchids from several now threatened protected areas, classed as \\\"Bosques Protectores\\\" (BPs), in the NW montane cloud forests. We examine two large (>5,000 ha) BPs, Los Cedros and El Chontal, and two medium BPs, Mashpi (1,178 ha) and Maquipucuna (2,474 ha). Since BP El Chontal is so poorly explored, we used several other small reserves (<500 hectares) in the Intag Valley to gain an idea of its biodiversity. Together, these BPs and reserves form a buffer and a southern corridor for the still-protected Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve, which is otherwise now surrounded by mining concessions. We gathered published literature, \\\"gray literature\\\", information from reserve records and websites, and our previously unpublished observations to make comparative species tables for each reserve. Our results from these still incompletely known reserves reveal the astonishing losses that mining will incur: eight critically endangered species, including two primates (brown-headed spider monkey and white-fronted capuchin), 37 endangered species, 149 vulnerable and 85 near threatened and a large number of less threatened species Our data show that each of the reserves protects a unique subset of taxa in this land of highly localized endemics. Each of the reserves also generates sustainable income for the local people. The short-term national profits from mining will not compensate for the permanent biodiversity losses, and the long-term ecosystem service and economic losses at the local and regional level.",

Comparing evolutionary trees to each other has widespread applications in comparing the evolutionary stories told by different sources of data, assessing the quality of inference methods, and highlighting areas where patterns of ancestry are uncertain. While these tasks are complicated by the fact that trees are high-dimensional structures encoding a large amount of information, there are a number of metrics suitable for comparing evolutionary trees whose tips have the same set of unique labels. There are also metrics for comparing trees where there is no relationship between their labels: in  unlabelled tree metrics the tree shapes are compared without reference to the tip labels.\\n\\nIn many interesting applications, however, the taxa present in two or more trees are related but not identical, and it is informative to compare the trees whilst retaining information about their tips relationships. We present methods for comparing trees whose labels belong to a pre-defined set of categories. The methods include a measure of distance between two such trees, and a measure of concordance between one such tree and a hierarchical classification tree of the unique categories. We demonstrate the intuition of our methods with some toy examples before presenting an analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis trees, in which we use our methods to quantify the differences between trees built from typing versus sequence data.",

    "abstract": "Recent molecular dating estimates for placental mammals echo fossil inferences for an explosive interordinal diversification, but typically place this event some 10-20 million years earlier than the Paleocene fossils, among apparently more \\\"primitive\\\" mammal faunas. However, current models of molecular evolution do not adequately account for parallel rate changes, and result in dramatic divergence underestimates for large, long-lived mammals such as whales and hominids. Calibrating among these taxa shifts the rate model errors deeper in the tree, inflating interordinal divergence estimates. We employ simulations based on empirical rate variation, which show that this \\\"error-shift inflation\\\" can explain previous molecular dating overestimates relative to fossil inferences. Molecular dating accuracy is substantially improved in the simulations by focusing on calibrations for taxa that retain plesiomorphic life-history characteristics. Applying this strategy to the empirical data favours the soft explosive model of placental evolution, in line with traditional palaeontological interpretations - a few Cretaceous placental lineages give rise to a rapid interordinal diversification following the 66 Ma Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary mass extinction. Our soft explosive model for the diversification of placental mammals brings into agreement previously incongruous molecular, fossil, and ancestral life history estimates, and closely aligns with a growing consensus for a similar model for bird evolution. We show that recent criticism of the soft explosive model relies on ignoring both experimental controls and statistical confidence, as well as misrepresentation, and inconsistent interpretations of morphological phylogeny. More generally, we suggest that the evolutionary properties of adaptive radiations may leave current molecular dating methods susceptible to overestimating the timing of major diversification events.",

However, the detailed evolutionary history and impact of tRNA modifying enzymes has not been analyzed. Using ancestral reconstruction of five tRNA modifications across 1093 bacteria, we show that most modifications were ancestral to eubacteria, but were repeatedly lost in many lineages. Most modification losses coincided with evolutionary shifts in non-target tRNAs, often driven by increased bias in genomic GC and associated codon use, or by genome reduction. In turn, the loss of tRNA modifications stabilized otherwise highly dynamic tRNA gene repertoires. Our work thus traces the complex history of bacterial tRNA modifications, providing the first clear evidence for their role in the evolution of bacterial translation.",

    "abstract": "Temporal variations in the activity of arthropod vectors can dramatically affect the epidemiology and evolution of vector-borne pathogens. Here we explore the \\\"Hawking hypothesis\\\" stating that these pathogens may evolve the ability to time investment in transmission to match the activity of their vectors. First, we use a theoretical model to identify the conditions promoting the evolution of time-varying transmission strategies in pathogens. Second, we experimentally test the \\\"Hawking hypothesis\\\" by monitoring the within-host dynamics of Plasmodium relictum throughout the acute and the chronic phases of the bird infection. To explore the periodicity in the host parasite density, we develop a new methodology to correct for non-stationarities in the host parasitaemia. We detect a periodic increase of parasitaemia and mosquito infection in the late afternoon that coincides with an increase in the biting activity of its natural vector. We also detect a positive effect of mosquito bites on Plasmodium replication in the birds both in the acute and in the chronic phases of the infection. This study highlights that Plasmodium parasites use two different strategies to increase the match between transmission potential and vector availability. We discuss the adaptive nature of these unconditional and plastic transmission strategies with respect to the time-scale and the predictability of the fluctuations in the activity of the vector.\\n\\nImpact SummarySeasonal and daily fluctuations in the environment affect the abundance and the activity of vectors and may therefore have profound consequences on the transmission of infectious diseases. Here we show that, in accord with evolutionary theory, malaria parasites have evolved two different and complementary strategies to cope with fluctuations in mosquito availability. First, Plasmodium relictum adopts an unconditional strategy whereby within-host parasitaemia and mosquito infection increases in the afternoon and in the evening, when its vector, the Culex pipiens mosquito, is most active. Second, we find evidence for a plastic strategy allowing the parasitaemia to rapidly increase after exposure to mosquito bites.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPhenotypic networks describing putative causal relationships among multiple phenotypes can be used to infer single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In GWAS with multiple phenotypes, reconstructing underlying causal structures among traits and SNPs using a single statistical framework is essential for understanding the entirety of genotype-phenotype maps. A structural equation model (SEM) can be used for such purposes.\\n\\nMethodsWe applied SEM to GWAS (SEM-GWAS) in chickens, taking into account putative causal relationships among body weight (BW), breast meat (BM), hen-house production (HHP), and SNPs. We assessed the performance of SEM-GWAS by comparing the model results with those obtained from traditional multi-trait association analyses (MTM-GWAS).\\n\\nResultsThree different putative causal path diagrams were inferred from highest posterior density (HPD) intervals of 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95 using the inductive causation algorithm. A positive path coefficient was estimated for BM[-&gt;]BW, and negative values were obtained for BM[-&gt;]HHP and BW[-&gt;]HHP in all implemented scenarios. Further, the application of SEM-GWAS enabled the decomposition of SNP effects into direct, indirect, and total effects, identifying whether a SNP effect is acting directly or indirectly on a given trait. In contrast, MTM-GWAS only captured overall genetic effects on traits, which is equivalent to combining the direct and indirect SNP effects from SEMGWAS.\\n\\nConclusionsAlthough MTM-GWAS and SEM-GWAS use the same probabilistic models, we provide evidence that SEM-GWAS captures complex relationships and delivers a more comprehensive understanding of SNP effects compared to MTM-GWAS. Our results showed that SEM-GWAS provides important insight regarding the mechanism by which identified SNPs control traits by partitioning them into direct, indirect, and total SNP effects.",

    "abstract": "In both NOD mice and humans, the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is dependent in part on autoreactive CD8+ T-cells recognizing pancreatic {beta}-cell peptides presented by often quite common MHC class I variants. Studies in NOD mice previously revealed the common H2-Kd and/or H2-Db class I molecules expressed by this strain acquire an aberrant ability to mediate pathogenic CD8+ T-cell responses through interactions with T1D susceptibility (Idd) genes outside the MHC. A gene(s) mapping to the Idd7 locus on proximal Chromosome 7 was previously shown to be an important contributor to the failure of the common class I molecules expressed by NOD mice to mediate the normal thymic negative selection of diabetogenic CD8+ T-cells. Using an inducible model of thymic negative selection and mRNA transcript analyses we initially identified an elevated Nfkbid expression variant is likely an NOD Idd7 region gene contributing to impaired thymic deletion of diabetogenic CD8+ T-cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic attenuation of Nfkbid expression in NOD mice resulted in improved negative selection of autoreactive diabetogenic AI4 and NY8.3 CD8+ T-cells. These results indicated allelic variants of Nfkbid represent an Idd7 gene contributing to the efficiency of intrathymic deletion of diabetogenic CD8+ T-cells. However, while enhancing thymic deletion of pathogenic CD8+ T-cells, ablation of Nfkbid expression surprisingly accelerated T1D onset in NOD mice likely at least in part by numerically decreasing regulatory T- and B-lymphocytes (Tregs/Bregs), thereby reducing their peripheral immunosuppressive effects.",

    "abstract": "Executive functions (EFs) are regulatory cognitive processes that support goal-directed thoughts and behaviors and that involve two primary networks of functional brain activity in adulthood. The current study assessed whether the same networks identified in adulthood underlie child EFs. Using task-based fMRI data from a diverse sample of N = 117 children and early adolescents (M age = 10.17 years), we assessed the extent to which neural activity was shared across three EF domains and whether these patterns reflected quantitative or qualitative differences relative to previously reported adult findings. Brain regions that were consistently engaged across switching, updating, and inhibition tasks closely corresponded to the cingulo-opercular and fronto-parietal networks identified in studies of adults. Isolating brain activity during more demanding task periods highlighted contributions of the dACC and anterior insular regions of the cingulo-opercular network. Results were independent of age and time-on-task effects. These results indicate that the two core brain networks that support EFs are in place by middle childhood. Improvement in EFs from middle childhood to adulthood, therefore, are likely due to quantitative changes in activity within these networks, rather than qualitative changes in the organization of the networks themselves. Improved knowledge of how the brains functional organization supports EF in childhood has critical implications for understanding the maturation of cognitive abilities.",

We first review structural connectivity studies using tract-tracing methods in non-human primates, and diffusion-weighted imaging and electrostimulation in humans. These studies suggest a monosynaptic connection exists between the lateral inferior frontal gyrus and the pre-supplementary and supplementary motor areas of the medial superior frontal gyrus. This connection is termed the FAT. We then review research on the left FATs putative role in supporting speech and language function, with particular focus on speech initiation, stuttering and verbal fluency. Next, we review research on the right FATs putative role supporting executive function, namely inhibitory control and conflict monitoring for action. We summarize the extant body of empirical work by suggesting that the FAT plays a domain general role in the planning, timing, and coordination of sequential motor movements through the resolution of competition among potential motor plans. However, we also propose some domain specialization across the hemispheres. On the left hemisphere, the circuit is proposed to be specialized for speech actions. On the right hemisphere, the circuit is proposed to be specialized for general action control of the organism, especially in the visuo-spatial domain. We close the review with a discussion of the clinical significance of the FAT, and suggestions for further research on the pathway.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThe frontal aslant tract (FAT) is a recently identified fiber pathway\\nC_LIO_LIIt connects inferior frontal gyrus with medial frontal motor areas\\nC_LIO_LIThe left FAT has been associated with speech and language function\\nC_LIO_LIThe right FAT has been associated with inhibitory control\\nC_LIO_LIBoth FAT pathways may function in sequential motor planning\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Prominent models of spike trains assume only one source of variability - stochastic (Poisson) spiking - when stimuli and behavior are fixed. However, spike trains may also reflect variability due to internal processes such as planning. For example, we can plan a movement at one point in time and execute it at some arbitrary later time. Neurons involved in planning may thus share an underlying time-course that is not precisely locked to the actual movement. Here we combine the standard Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) model with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to account for shared temporal variability. When applied to recordings from macaque premotor cortex, we find that time warping considerably improves predictions of neural activity.

    "abstract": "Non-invasive approaches to modulate oscillatory activity in the brain receive growing popularity in the scientific community. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been shown to modulate neural oscillations in a frequency specific manner. Due to a massive stimulation artifact at the targeted frequency, only little is known about effects of tACS during stimulation. I.e. it remains unclear how the continuous application of tACS affects event-related oscillations during cognitive tasks. Depending on whether tACS merely affects pre- or post-stimulus oscillations or both, stimulation can alter patterns of event-related oscillatory dynamics in various directions or may not affect them at all. Thus, knowledge about these directions is crucial to plan, predict and understand outcomes of solely behavioral tACS experiments. Here, a recently proposed procedure to suppress tACS artifacts by projecting MEG data into source space using spatial filtering was utilized to recover event-related power modulations in the alpha band during a mental rotation task. MEG of twenty-five volunteers was continuously recorded. After 10 minutes of baseline measurement, they received either 20 minutes of tACS at individual alpha frequency or sham stimulation. Another 40 minutes of MEG were acquired thereafter. Data were projected into source space and carefully examined for residual artifacts. Results revealed strong facilitation of event-related power modulations in the alpha band during tACS application. Data provide first direct evidence, that tACS does not counteract top-down suppression of intrinsic oscillations, but rather enhances pre-existent power modulations within the range of the individual alpha (=stimulation) frequency.\\n\\nSignificanceTranscranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is increasingly used in cognitive neuroscience to study the causal role of brain oscillations and cognition. However, online effects of tACS so far largely remain a  black box due to an intense electromagnetic artifact encountered during stimulation. The current study is the first to employ a spatial filtering approach to recover and systematically study event-related oscillatory dynamics during tACS, which can potentially be altered in various directions. TACS facilitated pre-existing patterns of oscillatory dynamics during the employed mental rotation task, but does not counteract or overwrite them. In addition, control analysis and a measure to quantify tACS artifact suppression are provided that can enrich future studies investigating tACS online effects.",

    "abstract": "Premature birth increases the risk of developing neurocognitive and neurobe-havioural disorders. The mechanisms of altered brain development causing these disorders are yet unknown. Studying the morphology and function of the brain during maturation provides us not only with a better understanding of normal development, but may help us to identify causes of abnormal development and their consequences. A particular difficulty is to distinguish abnormal patterns of neurodevelopment from normal variation. The Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) seeks to create a detailed four-dimensional (4D) connectome of early life. This connectome may provide insights into normal as well as abnormal patterns of brain development. As part of this project, more than a thousand healthy fetal and neonatal brains will be scanned in vivo. This requires computational methods which scale well to larger data sets. We propose a novel groupwise method for the construction of a spatio-temporal model of mean morphology from cross-sectional brain scans at different gestational ages. This model scales linearly with the number of images and thus improves upon methods used to build existing public neonatal atlases, which derive correspondence between all pairs of images. By jointly estimating mean shape and longitudinal change, the atlas created with our method overcomes temporal inconsistencies, which are encountered when mean shape and intensity images are constructed separately for each time point. Using this approach, we have constructed a spatio-temporal atlas from 275 healthy neonates between 35 and 44 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). The resulting atlas qualitatively preserves cortical details significantly better than publicly available atlases. This is moreover confirmed by a number of quantitative measures of the quality of the spatial normalisation and sharpness of the resulting template brain images.",

    "abstract": "With the advances in diffusion MRI and tractography, numerous atlases of the human pyramidal tract (PyT) have been proposed but the inherent limitation of tractography to resolve crossing bundles within the centrum semiovale have so far prevented the complete description of the most lateral PyT projections. Here, we combined a precise manual positioning of individual subcortical regions of interest along the descending pathway of the PyT with a new bundle-specific tractography algorithm. This later is based on anatomical priors to improve streamlines tracking in crossing areas. We then extracted both left and right PyT in a large cohort of 410 healthy participants and built a population-based atlas of the whole-fanning PyT with a complete description of its most cortico-lateral projections. Clinical applications are envisaged, the whole-fanning PyT atlas being likely a better marker of corticospinal integrity metrics than those currently used within the frame of prediction of post-stroke motor recovery. The present population-based PyT, freely available, provides an interesting tool for clinical applications in order to locate specific PyT damage and its impact to the short and long-term motor recovery after stroke.",

    "abstract": "Interneurons are critical for the proper functioning of neural circuits and are typically considered to act as linear point neurons. However, exciting new findings reveal complex, sub- and/or supralinear computations in the dendrites of various interneuron types. These findings challenge the point neuron dogma and call for a new theory of interneuron arithmetic. Using detailed, biophysically constrained models, we predict that dendrites of FS basket cells in both the hippocampus and mPFC come in two flavors: supralinear, supporting local sodium spikes within large-volume branches and sublinear, in small-volume branches. Synaptic activation of varying sets of these dendrites leads to somatic firing variability that cannot be explained by the point neuron reduction. Instead, a 2-stage Artificial Neural Network (ANN), with both sub- and supralinear hidden nodes, captures the variance. We propose that FS basket cells have substantially expanded computational capabilities sub-served by their non-linear dendrites and act as a 2-layer ANN.",

    "abstract": "AbstractExcessive skeletal deformations and brittle fractures in the vast majority of patients suffering from osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) are a result of substantially reduced bone quality. Since the mechanical competence of bone is dependent on the tissue characteristics at small length scales, it is of crucial importance to assess how osteogenesis imperfecta manifests at the micro- and nanoscale of bone. In this context, the Chihuahua (Chi/+) zebrafish, carrying a heterozygous glycine substitution in the 1 chain of collagen type I, has recently been proposed as suitable animal model of dominant OI. Similar to human severe OI type III, Chi/+ show skeletal deformities, altered mineralization patterns and a smaller body size. Using a multimodal approach targeting bone quality parameters, this study aims at quantifying the changes in bone morphology, structure and tissue composition of Chi/+ at multiple length scales. Morphological changes were assessed with high-resolution micro-CT imaging and showed that the vertebrae in Chi/+ had a significantly smaller size, thinner cortical shell and distorted shape. Tissue composition in vertebrae was investigated with quantitative backscattered electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, showing higher mean calcium content, greater matrix porosity, as well as lower mineral crystallinity and collagen maturity in comparison to controls. This study provides comprehensive quantitative data on bone quality indices in Chi/+ and thus further validates this mutant as an important model reflecting osseous characteristics associated with human classical dominant osteogenesis imperfecta, both at the whole bone level and the tissue level.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONIt is established that normal fetal HRV represents the integration of the autonomic nervous system, components due to fetal body and breathing movements, baroreflex and circadian processes. There is also some evidence of possible intrinsic pacemaker rhythms of the SA node affecting HRV in adult disease.\\n\\nHowever, whether intrinsic HRV (iHRV) exists in the fetal period and whether this is affected by chronic fetal hypoxia has never been tested. Here, we show iHRV in isolated hearts from fetal sheep in late gestation and significant effects on iHRV of pregnancy complicated by chronic fetal hypoxia.\\n\\nMETHODSChronically catheterized ewes carrying male singleton fetuses were exposed to normoxia (n=6) or hypoxia (10% inspired O2, n=9) for the last third of gestation (105-138 dG; term~145 dG) in bespoke isobaric chambers, as before. At 138dG, isolated hearts were studied under a Langendorff preparation. CIMVA software was used to calculate basal iHRV matrix indices across five signal-analytical domains from the systolic peaks within 15 min segments in each heart, as before. Data presented as Mean+SEM were compared by the Students t test for unpaired data.\\n\\nRESULTSThis level of maternal H yields fetal PaO2 values of 11.5{+/-}0.6 relative to controls of 20.9{+/-}0.5 mmHg. Hearts isolated from H pregnancy showed approximately 4-fold increases in the Grid transformation feature as well as the AND similarity index (sgridAND, informational domain) and a 4-fold reduction in the Scale dependent Lyapunov exponent slope (SDLEalpha, invariant domain). We also detected a 2-fold reduction in the Recurrence quantification analysis, the percentage of laminarity and recurrences and maximum diagonal line (pL, pR, dlmax, all from geometric domain) and (AsymI, energetic domain). For dlmax and sgridAND measures, this is also correlated to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) across both groups.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThe isolated fetal hearts from the hypoxic pregnancy group exhibit a lower complexity in iHRV. This is the first evidence that iHRV originates in fetal life and that chronic fetal hypoxia significantly alters it.\\n\\nSignificance StatementFetal heart rate variability (fHRV) is an important indicator of health and disease, yet its physiological origins are poorly understood. Both, the heart, intrinsically, and extrinsic systems, such as the brain, are hypothesized to contribute to HRV. In a near-term fetal sheep model of human development, we identified fHRV components reflecting intrinsic contributions to fHRV. In addition, we show that these intrinsic fHRV components carry memory of chronic oxygen deprivation the fetus experienced during the last third of gestation.",

    "abstract": "SHORTROOT (SHR) is essential for stem cell maintenance and radial patterning in Arabidopsis thaliana roots, but how its expression is regulated is still unknown. Here, we report that Elongator regulates the transcription of SHR. The depletion of Elongator drastically reduced SHR expression and led to defective root stem cell maintenance and radial patterning. The importance of the nuclear localization of Elongator for its functioning, together with the insensitivity of the elp1 mutant to the transcription elongation inhibitor 6-azauracil and the direct interaction of the ELP4 subunit with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII CTD), support the notion that Elongator plays important roles in transcription elongation. Indeed, we found that ELP3 associates with the pre-mRNA of SHR and that mutation of Elongator reduces the enrichment of RNAPII on the SHR gene body. Moreover, Elongator interacted in vivo with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4 (SPT4), a well-established transcription elongation factor that was recruited to the SHR locus. Together, these results demonstrate that Elongator acts in concert with SPT4 to regulate the transcription of SHR.",

These technologies may be esoteric to the practicing neurosurgeon. We explored a range of 3D scanning and stereolithographic techniques to create patient-specific synthetic implants.\\n\\nMethodsWe simulated bilateral craniectomies from a single cadaveric specimen to create 3 methods of creating stereolithographically-viable virtual models. Firstly, we used  pre-and-post operative CT derived bony windows to create a virtual skull model, from which the flap was extracted. Secondly, we used an entry-level 3D light-scanner to scan and render models of the individual bone pieces. Thirdly, we used an arm-mounted, 3D laser-scanner to create virtual models using a real-time approach.\\n\\nResultsFlaps were printed from the CT scanner and laser scanner models only, in a UV-cured polymer. The light scanner did not produce suitable virtual models for printing. The CT scanner derived models required extensive post-fabrication modification to fit the existing defects. The laser-scanner models assumed good fit within the defects without any modification.\\n\\nConclusionsThe methods presented varying levels of complexity in acquisition and model rendering. Each technique required hardware at varying in price points from $0 to [~]$100,000. The laser-scanner models produced the best quality parts which bore near-perfect fit with the original defects.

    "abstract": "The dynein-2 microtubule motor is the retrograde motor for intraflagellar transport. Mutations in dynein-2 components cause skeletal ciliopathies, notably Jeune syndrome. Dynein-2 comprises a heterodimer of two non-identical intermediate chains, WDR34 and WDR60. Here, we use knockout cell lines to demonstrate that each intermediate chain has a distinct role in cilia function. Both proteins are required to maintain a functional transition zone and for efficient bidirectional intraflagellar transport, only WDR34 is essential for axoneme extension. In contrast, only WDR60 is essential for co-assembly of the other subunits. Furthermore, WDR60 cannot compensate for loss of WDR34 or vice versa. This work defines a functional asymmetry to match the subunit asymmetry within the dynein-2 motor. Analysis of causative point mutations in WDR34 and WDR60 can partially restore function to knockout cells. Our data show that Jeune syndrome is caused by defects in transition zone architecture as well as intraflagellar transport.\\n\\nSUMMARYHere, Vuolo and colleagues use engineered knockout human cell lines to define roles for dynein-2 intermediate chains.

    "abstract": "BackgroundDelirium increases the risk of mortality during an acute hospital admission. Full syndromal delirium (FSD) is associated with greatest risk and subsyndromal delirium (SSD) is associated with intermediate risk, compared to patients with no delirium - suggesting a dose-response relationship. It is not clear how individual diagnostic symptoms of delirium influence the association with mortality. Our objectives were to measure the prevalence of FSD and SSD, and assess the effect that FSD, SSD and individual symptoms of delirium (from the Confusion Assessment Method-short version (s-CAM)) have on mortality rates.\\n\\nMethodsExploratory analysis of a prospective cohort (aged [&ge;] 70 years) with acute (unplanned) medical admission (4/6/2007-4/11/2007). The outcome was mortality (data censored 6/10/2011). The principal exposures were FSD and SSD compared to no delirium (as measured by the CAM), along with individual delirium symptoms on the CAM. Cox regression was used to estimate the impact FSD and SSD and individual CAM items had on mortality.\\n\\nResultsThe cohort (n=610) mean age was 83 (SD 7); 59% were female. On admission, 11% had FSD and 33% had SSD. Of the key diagnostic symptoms for delirium, 17% acute onset, 19% inattention, 17% disorganised thinking and 17% altered level of consciousness. Unadjusted analysis found FSD had an increased hazard ratio (HR) of 2.31 (95%CI 1.71, 3.12), for SSD the HR was 1.26 (1.00, 1.59). Adjusted analysis remained significant for FSD (1.55 95%CI 1.10, 2.18) but nonsignificant for SSD (HR=0.92 95% CI 0.70, 1.19). Two CAM items were significantly associated with mortality following adjustment: acute onset and disorganised thinking.\\n\\nConclusionWe observed a dose-response relationship between mortality and delirium, FSD had the greatest risk and SSD having intermediate risk. The CAM items \\\"acute onset\\\" and \\\"disorganised thinking\\\" drove the associations observed. Clinically, this highlights the necessity of identifying individual symptoms of delirium.",

Common high-throughput sequencing methods rely on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to expand the starting material, but not every molecule amplifies equally, causing some to be overrepresented. Unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) can be used to distinguish undesirable PCR duplicates derived from a single molecule and identical but biologically meaningful reads from different molecules. We have incorporated UMIs into RNA-seq and small RNA-seq protocols and developed tools to analyze the resulting data. Our UMIs contain stretches of random nucleotides whose lengths sufficiently capture diverse molecule species in both RNA-seq and small RNA-seq libraries generated from mouse testis. Our approach yields high-quality data while allowing unique tagging of all molecules in high-depth libraries. Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that our methods increase the reproducibility of RNA-seq and small RNA-seq data. Notably, we find that the amount of starting material and sequencing depth, but not the number of PCR cycles, determine PCR duplicate frequency. Finally, we show that computational removal of PCR duplicates based only on their mapping coordinates introduces substantial bias into data analysis.",

    "abstract": "Empathy has received considerable attention from the field of cognitive and social neuroscience. A significant portion of these studies used the event-related potential (ERP) technique to study the mechanisms of empathy for pain in others in different conditions and clinical populations. These show that specific ERP components measured during the observation of pain in others are modulated by several factors and altered in clinical populations. However, issues present in this literature such as analytical flexibility and lack of type 1 error control raise doubts regarding the validity and reliability of these conclusions. The current study compiled the results and methodological characteristics of 40 studies using ERP to study empathy of pain in others. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that the centro-parietal P3 and late positive potential component are sensitive to the observation of pain in others, while the early N1 and N2 components are not reliably associated with vicarious pain observation. The review of the methodological characteristics shows that the presence of selective reporting, analytical flexibility and lack of type 1 error control compromise the interpretation of these results. The implication of these results for the study of empathy and potential solutions to improve future investigations are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Acquisition and maintenance of complex vocal behaviors like human speech and oscine birdsong require continuous auditory feedback. The exact way in which this feedback is integrated into the vocal motor programs is not completely understood. Here we show that in sleeping zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), the activity of the song system selectively evoked by playbacks of their own song can be detected in the syrinx. Measuring the electrical activity of syringeal muscles, we found playback-evoked patterns identical to those recorded during song execution. Using this global and continuous readout we studied the activation dynamics of the song system elicited by different auditory stimuli. We found that a synthetic version of the birds song, rendered by a physical model of the avian phonation apparatus, evoked exactly the same response, albeit with lower efficiency. Analysis of these responses reveal a predictive and switch-like activation of the motor program, with preferred activation instants within the song.\\n\\nSignificanceThe study of the integration between sensory inputs and motor commands has greatly benefited from the finding that in sleeping oscine birds, playback of their own song evokes highly specific firing patterns in neurons also involved in the production of that song. Nevertheless, the sparse spiking patterns that can be recorded from few single neurons gives limited information of the overall activity of the song system. Here we show that this response is not limited to the central nervous system, but reaches vocal muscles. Combining this integrated measure of the activity of the system with surrogate synthetic songs, we found an all-or-nothing and predictive activation of the system, suggesting the existence of a pre-programmed internal dynamics.",

Here we describe a platform for specifically activating {beta}-arrestin-dependent signaling in situ. The platform, which we have dubbed \\\"GA-PAIR\\\" (GPCR/{beta}-Arrestin -Plant protein and Abscisic acid Induced Recruitment), can be controlled by the inert phytochemical S-(+)-abscisic acid (ABA). ABA induces interaction between ABI1 (ABA Insensitive 1) and PYL1 (Pyrabactin Resistance (PYR) 1-Like), two plant proteins with no mammalian counterparts. We fused ABI to the engineered human muscarinic M3 G protein-coupled receptor (hM3Dq) and PYL1 to {beta}-arrestin2. Addition of ABA induced rapid and nearly complete translocation of the PYL-{beta}-arrestin fusion protein and, importantly, induced both ERK and Akt signaling. Photo-uncaging a new photo-caged ABA analogue allowed us to gain relatively precise spatio-temporal control over {beta}-arrestin translocation. Because GA-PAIR facilitates the exclusive activation of endogenous {beta}-arrestin signaling pathways in the absence of a GPCR ligand or G protein, the GA-PAIR system will facilitate deconvoluting GPCR signaling in situ.",

By adapting an MS-based metabolomics workflow for high-throughput profiling of diverse adherent mammalian cells, we establish a technique for the rapid measurement and analysis of drug-induced dynamic changes in intracellular metabolites. This methodology is scalable to large compound libraries and is here applied to study the mechanism underlying the toxic effect of dichloroacetate in ovarian cancer cell lines. System-level analysis of the metabolic responses revealed a key and unexpected role of CoA imbalance in dichloroacetate toxicity. The herein proposed strategy for large-scale drug metabolic profiling is complementary to other molecular profiling techniques, opening new scientific and drug-discovery opportunities.",

The present paper deals on a meta-analysis which identified as a problem the lack of consolidate information and data analysis about the use of planarian as animal model, and specifically the use of magnetic field in regeneration experiments. To conduct the meta-analysis 1255 papers published since 1955 to 2017 were analysed, identifying the Stem cell biology and regeneration as the most published topic, with 276 papers, followed by molecular and cellular analyses (238), genetics (175), inter and transdisciplinary research (107), ecotoxicological evaluations (102), animal model (67), ecological and biological studies (56), magnetic field (57), developmental biology (32) and RNA regulation (31).Other statistics and metrics indicators were taken in to account like total of papers and distribution per year, distribution of paper by journals and selection of main journals according to the number of published papers, most cited papers, authors and countries and distribution of papers by countries. Finally, were analysed those papers with Planarians research using magnetic field, all of them published during the last three years. It was an evidence that this topic is becoming a trending with rising interest, being the most reported species to study the magnetic field effects Dugesia spp. and Girardia sp.\\n\\nSummary statementThis work presents a meta-analysis which allows consolidating information and a better understanding of trends in Planarian researches, emphasizing in the use of magnetic field.",

    "abstract": "Information on species distributions and abundances, and how these change over time are central to the study of the ecology and conservation of animal populations. This information is challenging to obtain at relevant scales across range-wide extents for two main reasons. First, local and regional processes that affect populations vary throughout the year and across species ranges, requiring fine-scale, year-round information across broad -- sometimes hemispheric -- spatial extents. Second, while citizen science projects can collect data at these scales, using these data requires appropriate analysis to address known sources of bias. Here we present an analytical framework to address these challenges and generate year-round, range-wide distributional information using citizen science data. To illustrate this approach, we apply the framework to Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), a long-distance Neotropical migrant and species of conservation concern, using data from the citizen science project eBird. We estimate occurrence and relative abundance with enough spatiotemporal resolution to support inference across a range of spatial scales throughout the annual cycle. Additionally, we generate intra-annual estimates of the range, intra-annual estimates of the associations between species and the local environment, and inter-annual trends in relative abundance. This is the first example of an analysis to capture intra- and inter-annual distributional dynamics across the entire range of a broadly distributed, highly mobile species.",

The scale of the contribution of alternative splicing (AS) to stress responses has been underestimated due to limitations in RNA-seq analysis programs and poor representation of AS transcripts in plant databases. Significantly, the dynamics of the AS response have not been investigated but this is now possible with accurate transcript quantification programs and AtRTD2, a new, comprehensive transcriptome for Arabidopsis.\\n\\nResultsUsing ultra-deep RNA-sequencing of a time-course of Arabidopsis thaliana plants exposed to cold treatment, we identified 8,949 genes with altered expression of which 2,442 showed significant differential alternative splicing (DAS) and 1,647 genes were regulated only at the level of AS (DAS-only). The high temporal resolution demonstrated the rapid induction of both transcription and AS resulting in coincident waves of differential expression (transcription) and differential alternative splicing in the first 6-9 hours of cold. The differentially expressed and DAS gene sets were largely non-overlapping, each comprising thousands of genes. The dynamic analysis of AS identified genes with rapid and sensitive AS within 3 h of transfer to the cold (early AS genes), which were enriched for splicing and transcription factors. A detailed investigation of the novel cold-response DAS-only gene, U2B\\\"-LIKE, suggested that it regulates AS and is required for tolerance to freezing.\\n\\nConclusionsOur data indicate that transcription and AS are the major regulators of transcriptome reprogramming that together govern the physiological and survival responses of plants to low temperature.",

Septin 7 function in lymphocytes, however, is poorly characterized. Since the intracellular signaling role of septin 7 is dependent on its interaction network, interaction proteomics was applied to attain novel knowledge about septin 7 function in hematopoietic cells. Our previous finding of decreased septin 7 expression in blood-derived lymphocytes in ERU, a spontaneous animal model for autoimmune uveitis in man, extended the role of septin 7 to a potential key player in autoimmunity. Here, we revealed novel insights into septin 7 function by identification of DOCK8 as an interaction partner in primary blood-derived lymphocytes. Since DOCK8 is associated with important immune functions, our finding of significantly decreased DOCK8 expression and altered DOCK8 interaction network in ERU might explain changes in immune response and shows the contribution of DOCK8 in pathomechanisms of spontaneous autoimmune diseases. Moreover, our analyses revealed insights in DOCK8 function, by identifying the signal transducer ILK as a DOCK8 interactor in lymphocytes. Our finding of the enhanced enrichment of ILK in ERU cases indicates a deviant influence of DOCK8 on inter- and intracellular signaling in autoimmune disease.",

    "abstract": "GABA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compact (SNc) play key roles in reward and aversion through their local inhibitory control of dopamine neuron activity and through long-range projections to several target regions including the nucleus accumbens. It is not clear if some of these GABA neurons are dedicated local interneurons or if they all collateralize and send projections externally as well as making local synaptic connections. Testing between these possibilities has been challenging in the absence of interneuron-specific molecular markers. We hypothesised that one potential candidate might be neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a common interneuronal marker in other brain regions. To test this, we used a combination of immunolabelling (including antibodies for nNOS that we validated in tissue from nNOS-deficient mice) and cell-type-specific virus-based anterograde tracing in mice. We show that nNOS-expressing neurons in the parabrachial pigmented (PBP) part of the VTA and the SNc are GABAergic local interneurons, whereas nNOS-expressing neurons in the Rostral Linear Nucleus (RLi) are mostly glutamatergic and project to a number of regions, including the lateral hypothalamus, the ventral pallidum, and the median raphe nucleus. Taken together, these findings indicate that nNOS is expressed by neurochemically- and anatomically-distinct neuronal sub-groups in a sub-region-specific manner in the VTA and SNc.",

Here we show that these findings can be at least partly explained by the asymmetric network embedding of the primary auditory cortices. Using diffusion-weighted imaging in three independent datasets, we investigate the propensity for left and right auditory cortex to communicate with other brain areas by quantifying the centrality of the auditory network across a spectrum of communication mechanisms, from shortest path communication to diffusive spreading. Across all datasets, we find that the right auditory cortex is better integrated in the connectome, facilitating more efficient communication with other areas, with much of the asymmetry driven by differences in communication pathways to the opposite hemisphere. Critically, the primacy of the right auditory cortex emerges only when communication is conceptualized as a diffusive process, taking advantage of more than just the topologically shortest paths in the network. Altogether, these results highlight how the network configuration and embedding of a particular region may contribute to its functional lateralization.",

    "abstract": "The roles of neuromodulation in a neural network, such as in a cortical microcolumn, are still incompletely understood. Neuromodulation influences neural processing by presynaptic and postsynaptic regulation of synaptic efficacy. Synaptic efficacy modulation can be an effective way to rapidly alter network density and topology. We show that altering network topology, together with density, will affect its synchronization. Fast synaptic efficacy modulation may therefore influence the amount of correlated spiking in a network. Neuromodulation also affects ion channel regulation for intrinsic excitability, which alters the neurons activation function. We show that synchronization in a network influences the read-out of these intrinsic properties. Highly synchronous input drives neurons, such that differences in intrinsic properties disappear, while asynchronous input lets intrinsic properties determine output behavior. Thus, altering network topology can alter the balance between intrinsically vs. synaptically driven network activity. We conclude that neuromodulation may allow a network to shift between a more synchronized transmission mode and a more asynchronous intrinsic read-out mode.",

Little information is yet available, however, about transcriptome changes during aging when comparing mammals with different lifespans. For this reason, we studied the transcriptomes of five tissues and two age cohorts in two similar sized rodent species with very different lifespans: rat (Rattus norvegicus) and giant mole-rat (Fukomys mechowii) with maximum lifespans of 3.8 and >20 years, respectively. Our results show that giant mole-rats exhibit higher transcriptome stability during aging than the rat. While well-known aging signatures (e.g. up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes) were detected in all rat tissues, they showed up only in one giant mole-rat tissue. Furthermore, many differentially expressed genes that were found in both species, were regulated in opposite directions during aging. This suggests that expression changes that cause aging in short-lived species are counteracted in long-lived species. Taken together, transcriptome stability may be one key causal factor of the long life- and healthspan of giant mole-rats and maybe of African mole-rats in general.",

Motility is one of the features of sperm that allows them to succeed in fertilization, and their flagellum is essential for this function. Longitudinally, the flagellum divides into the midpiece, the principal piece, and the end piece. A precise cytoskeletal architecture of the sperm tail is key for the acquisition of fertilization competence. It has been proposed that the actin cytoskeleton plays essential roles in the regulation of sperm motility, however, actin organization in sperm remains elusive. In the present work, we found different types of actin structures in the sperm tail, using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). In the principal piece, actin is radially distributed between the axoneme and the plasma membrane. The actin-associated proteins spectrin and adducin are also found in these structures. Strikingly, polymerized actin in the midpiece forms a double-helix that accompanies mitochondria. Our findings illustrate a novel specialized structure of actin filaments in a mammalian cell.",

    "abstract": "Dynamin GTPases are best studied for their role in the terminal membrane fission process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME); but, they have also been proposed to regulate earlier stages of CME. Although highly enriched in neurons, dynamin-1 (Dyn1) is, in fact, widely expressed along with dynamin-2 (Dyn2), but inactivated in non-neuronal cells via phosphorylation by GSK3{beta} kinase. Here, we study the differential, isoform-specific functions of Dyn1 and Dyn2 as regulators of CME. Endogenously expressed Dyn1 and Dyn2 were fluorescently-tagged either separately or together in two cell lines with contrasting Dyn1 expression levels. By quantitative live cell dual and triple-channel total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy we find that Dyn2 is more efficiently recruited to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) than Dyn1, and that Dyn2, but not Dyn1 exhibits a burst of assembly prior to CCV formation. Activation of Dyn1 by acute inhibition of GSK3{beta} results in more rapid endocytosis of transferrin receptors, increased rates of CCP initiation and decreased CCP lifetimes, but did not significantly affect the extent of Dyn1 recruitment to CCPs. Thus, activated Dyn1 can regulate early stages of CME even when present at low, substoichiometric levels relative to Dyn2, and apparently without assembly into supramolecular collar-like structures. Under physiological conditions Dyn1 is activated downstream of EGF-receptor signaling to alter CCP dynamics. We identify sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) as a preferred binding partner to activated Dyn1 that is partially required for Dyn1-dependent effects on early stages of CCP maturation. Together, we decouple regulatory and scission functions of dynamins and report a scission-independent, isoformspecific regulatory role for Dyn1 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.",

PDGFR signaling promotes OPC homeostasis and its attenuation signals OPC differentiation and maturation triggering the onset of myelination of the central nervous system (CNS). The initial steps of how PDGFR signaling is attenuated are still poorly understood. Herein we show that decreased Protein Arginine MethylTransferase5 (PRMT5) expression, as occurs during OPC differentiation, is involved in the down-regulation of PDGFR by modulating its cell surface bioavailability leading to its degradation in a Cbldependent manner. Mechanistically, loss of arginine methylation at R554 of the PDGFR intracellular domain reveals a masked Cbl binding site at Y555. Physiologically, depletion of PRMT5 in OPCs results in severe CNS myelination defects. We propose that decreased PRMT5 activity initiates PDGFR degradation to promote OL differentiation.

Thus, hiw functions to both positively and negatively regulate nociceptors. We find that a sensory transduction-independent sensitization pathway was associated with BMP signaling. BMP signaling in nociceptors was up-regulated in hiw mutants, and nociceptor-specific expression of hiw rescued all nociception phenotypes including the increased BMP signaling. Blocking the transcriptional output of the BMP pathway with dominant negative Mad suppressed nociceptive hypersensitivity that was induced by interfering with hiw. The up-regulated BMP signaling phenotype in hiw genetic mutants could not be suppressed by mutation in wallenda suggesting that hiw regulates BMP in nociceptors via a wallenda independent pathway. In a newly established Ca2+ imaging preparation, we observed that up-regulated BMP signaling caused a significantly enhanced Ca2+ signal in the axon terminals of nociceptors that were stimulated by noxious heat. This response likely accounts for the nociceptive hypersensitivity induced by elevated BMP signaling in nociceptors. Finally, we showed that acute activation of BMP signaling in nociceptors was sufficient to sensitize nociceptive responses to optogenetically-triggered nociceptor activation without altering nociceptor morphology. Overall, this study demonstrates the previously unrevealed roles of the Hiw-BMP pathway in the regulation of nociception and provides the first direct evidence that up-regulated BMP signaling physiologically sensitizes responses of nociceptors and nociception behaviors.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAlthough pain is a universally experienced sensation that has a significant impact on human lives and society, the molecular mechanisms of pain remain poorly understood. Elucidating these mechanisms is particularly important to gaining insight into the clinical development of currently incurable chronic pain diseases. Taking an advantage of the powerful genetic model organism Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies), we unveil the Highwire-BMP signaling pathway as a novel molecular pathway that regulates the sensitivity of nociceptive sensory neurons. Highwire and the molecular components of the BMP signaling pathway are known to be widely conserved among animal phyla, from nematode worms to humans. Since abnormal sensitivity of nociceptive sensory neurons can play a critical role in the development of chronic pain conditions, a deeper understanding of the regulation of nociceptor sensitivity has the potential to advance effective therapeutic strategies to treat difficult pain conditions.",

    "abstract": "CapsuleComparative analysis of gene expression signatures from endometriosis and mouse models shows that CACNA2{delta}s calcium-channel components involved in nociception are targets for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain.\\n\\nContextDifferential gene expression analyses comparing endometriotic lesions to eutopic endometrium have shown that the transcription factors DLX5 and DLX6 are drastically down-regulated in the ectopic implants. These finding suggests that regulatory cascades involving DLX5/6 might be involved in the origin of endometriosis symptoms such as chronic pelvic pain.

CACNA2D3, a component of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex is strongly overexpressed both in endometriosis implants and in mutant mouse uteri; other members of the alfa2delta family, CACNA2D1 and CACNA2D2, are also overexpressed in endometriosis.\\n\\nConclusionCACNA2D1, CACNA2D2 and CACNA2D3 are directly involved in pain perception. In particular, CACNA2D3 has been associated to pain sensitization and heat nociception in animal models while, in patients, variants of this gene are associated to reduced sensitivity to acute noxious stimuli. As CACNA2Ds are targets of gabapentinoids analgesics, our results suggest to consider the use of these drugs for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain. Indeed, recent small-scale clinical studies have shown that gabapentin can be effective in the treatment of women chronic pelvic pain. Our findings reinforce the need for a large definitive trial.",

    "abstract": "The Brucella abortus general stress response sigma factor, {sigma}E1, directly and indirectly regulates the transcription of dozens of genes that influence stress survival and host infection. Characterizing the functions of {sigma}E1 regulated genes therefore contributes to understanding of B. abortus physiology and infection biology. Transcription of the IclR family regulator, Bab2_0215, is indirectly activated by {sigma}E1 but its function remains undefined. We present a structural and functional characterization of Bab2_0215, which we have named Brucella adipic acid activated regulator (BaaR). BaaR adopts a classic IclR-family fold and directly regulates the transcription of two operons with predicted roles in carboxylic acid oxidation. BaaR binds two sites on chromosome II between baaR and a divergently transcribed hydratase/dehydrogenase (acaD2), and represses transcription. We identified three carboxylic acids (adipic acid tetradecanedioic acid, {varepsilon}-aminocaproic acid) and a lactone ({varepsilon}-caprolactone) that enhance transcription from the baaR and acaD2 promoters. However, neither the activating acids nor caprolactone enhance transcription by binding directly to BaaR. Induction of baaR transcription by adipic acid requires the gene bab2_0213, which encodes a major facilitator superfamily transporter, suggesting that Bab2_0213 transports adipic acid across the inner membrane. We conclude that a set of structurally related organic molecules activate transcription of genes repressed by BaaR. Our study provides molecular-level understanding of a gene expression program regulated downstream of {sigma}E1.",

Both processes are mediated by interactions between organismal traits and environmental constraints. Colonization probability is predicted by a species ability to cross the intervening matrix between a population source and the island; population persistence (or extinction) is predicted by the minimum spatial requirements to sustain an isolated population. The non-random distributions of mammals on islands of the Sunda Shelf and Great Basin \\\"sky islands\\\" provide example study systems for evaluating the C-DIB model.\\n\\nMain conclusionsBecause different suites of traits impose constraints on the processes of colonization and extinction, similar environmental conditions can host different candidate species despite the same predicted richness.

Here, we show that in contrast to yeast, FACT accumulates at the transcription start site of genes reminiscent of RNA Polymerase II profile. Depletion of FACT in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to up-regulation of pro-proliferative genes and key pluripotency factors concomitant with hyper-proliferation of mES cells. Using MNase-, ATAC-, and Nascent Elongating Transcript Sequencing (NET-seq) we show that up-regulation of genes coincides with loss of nucleosomes upstream of the TSS and concomitant increase in antisense transcription, indicating that FACT impacts the promoter architecture to regulate expression of these genes. Finally, we demonstrate a role for FACT in cell fate determination and show that FACT depletion primes ES cells for the neuronal lineage.",

    "abstract": "The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates various growth- and developmental processes in response to limiting water conditions. ABA functions through an established signaling pathway consisting of PYR1/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors that inhibit group A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) in an ABA-dependent manner. Inhibition of PP2Cs enables the activation of SnRK2-type protein kinases that phosphorylate downstream targets including transcription factors and ion channels. However, ABA-dependent signals have to be integrated into other growth- and developmental programs to ensure a successful life cycle. Here, we have characterized the role of the protein kinase WNK8 in the ABA signalling pathway. Two T-DNA insertion alleles wnk8-1 and wnk8-4 exhibited contrasting ABA responses during seed germination and young seedling growth. However, reciprocal crossings with wild type plants suggested that wnk8-1 that still expressed the WNK8 kinase domain functioned in a hypermorphic and dominant manner. WNK8 directly interacted with the PP2C PP2CA in planta and was negatively regulated by this phosphatase in vitro. WNK8 also phosphorylated the ABA receptor PYR1 in vitro. Double mutant analyses revealed that the dominant allele wnk8-1 suppressed the ABA- and glucose hypersensitivity of the pp2ca-1 T-DNA allele. In transient protoplast assays WNK8 suppressed ABA-induced reporter gene expression that was dependent on a functional kinase. In summary, we have identified the protein kinase WNK8 as a negative regulator of ABA responses during young seedling establishment through its direct interaction with core ABA signaling components.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe phytohormone abscisic acid regulates the water household of plants through a defined core signaling pathway.

Yet, some tissues may lack molecular profiles necessary for interactome inference (orphan tissues), or, as for single cells isolated from heterogeneous samples, their tissue context may be undetermined. To address this problem, we introduce metaVIPER, a novel algorithm designed to assess protein activity in tissue-independent by integrative analysis of multiple, non-tissue-matched interactomes. This assumes that transcriptional targets of each protein will be recapitulated by one or more available interactome. We confirmed the algorithms value in assessing protein dysregulation induced by somatic mutations, as well as in assessing protein activity in orphan tissues and, most critically, in single cells, thus allowing transformation of noisy and potentially biased RNA-Seq signatures into reproducible protein-activity signatures.",

To our knowledge, the data reported herein represents the highest resolution imaging of murine white matter structure achieved in vivo across a wide field of view of several millimeters. When applied to an orthotopic murine glioblastoma xenograft model, SM-OCT readily identifies brain tumor margins with near single-cell resolution. SM-OCT of ex vivo human temporal lobe tissue reveals fine structures including cortical layers and myelinated axons. Finally, when applied to an ex vivo sample of a low-grade glioma resection margin, SM-OCT is able to resolve the brain tumor margin.

However, most studies deal only with one cooperative behaviour, even though some organisms perform two or more cooperative behaviours. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum performs two cooperative behaviours in starvation: fruiting body formation and macrocyst formation. Here, we constructed a model that couples these two behaviours, and we found that the two behaviours are maintained due to the emergence of cyclic dominance, although cooperation cannot evolve if only either of the two behaviours is performed. The common chemoattractant cyclic AMP is used in both fruiting body formation and macrocyst formation, providing a biological context for this coupling. Cyclic dominance emerges regardless of the existence of mating types or spatial structure in the model. In addition, cooperation can re-emerge in the population even after it goes extinct. These results indicate that the two cooperative behaviours of the social amoeba are maintained due to the common chemical signal that underlies both fruiting body formation and macrocyst formation. We demonstrate the importance of coupling multiple games when the underlying behaviours are associated with one another.",

    "abstract": "The pH of the endo-lysosomal system is tightly regulated by a balance of proton pump and leak mechanisms that are critical for storage, recycling, turnover and signaling functions in the cell. Dysregulation of endo-lysosomal pH has been linked to aging, amyloidogenesis, synaptic dysfunction, and various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers disease. Therefore, understanding mechanisms that regulate luminal pH may be key to identifying new targets for treatment of these disorders. Meta-analysis of yeast microarray databases revealed that nutrient limiting conditions upregulated transcription of the endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger Nhx1 by inhibition of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) Rpd3, resulting in vacuolar alkalinization. Consistent with these findings, Rpd3 inhibition by the HDAC inhibitor and antifungal drug trichostatin A induced Nhx1 expression and vacuolar alkalinization. Bioinformatics analysis of Drosophila and mouse databases revealed that caloric control of Nhx1 orthologs DmNHE3 and NHE6 respectively, was also mediated by histone deacetylases. We show that NHE6 is a target of cAMP-response element-binding (CREB) protein, providing a molecular mechanism for nutrient and HDAC dependent regulation of endosomal pH. Control of NHE6 expression by pharmacological targeting of the CREB pathway can be used to regulate endosomal pH and restore defective amyloid A{beta} clearance in an ApoE4 astrocyte model of Alzheimers disease. These observations from yeast, fly, mouse and cell culture models reveal an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for regulation of endosomal NHE expression by histone deacetylases and offer new therapeutic strategies for modulation of endo-lysosomal pH in fungal infection and human disease.",

A key assumption in many models for retinal ganglion cell encoding is that receptive field surrounds are added only to the fully formed center signal. But anatomical and functional observations indicate that surrounds are added before the summation of signals across receptive field subunits that creates the center. Here, we show that this receptive field architecture has an important consequence for spatial contrast encoding: the surround can control sensitivity to fine spatial structure by changing the way the center integrates visual information over space. The impact of the surround is particularly prominent when center and surround signals are correlated, as they are in natural stimuli. This role of the surround differs substantially from classic center-surround models and raises the possibility that the surround plays unappreciated roles in shaping ganglion cell sensitivity to natural inputs.",
