    "abstract": "The study of ecological communities often involves detailed simulations of complex networks. But our empirical knowledge of these networks is typically incomplete, and the space of simulation models and parameters is vast, leaving room for uncertainty in theoretical predictions. Here, we show that a large fraction of this space of possibilities exhibits generic behaviors that are robust to modelling choices. We consider a wide array of model features, including interaction types and community structures, known to generate different dynamics for a few species. We combine these features in large simulated communities, and show that equilibrium diversity, functioning and stability can be predicted analytically using a random model parameterized by a few statistical properties of the community. We give an ecological interpretation of this \\\"disordered\\\" limit where structure fails to emerge from complexity. We also demonstrate that some well-studied interaction patterns remain relevant in large ecosystems, but their impact can be encapsulated in a minimal number of additional parameters. Our approach provides a powerful framework for predicting the outcomes of ecosystem assembly and quantifying the added value of more detailed models and measurements.",

    "abstract": "Countries vary in their geographical and cultural properties. Only a few studies have explored how such variations influence how humans navigate or reason about space [1-7]. We predicted that these variations impact human cognition, resulting in an organized spatial distribution of cognition at a planetary-wide scale. To test this hypothesis we developed a mobile-app-based cognitive task, measuring non-verbal spatial navigation ability in more than 2.5 million people, sampling populations in every nation state. We focused on spatial navigation due to its universal requirement across cultures. Using a clustering approach, we find that navigation ability is clustered into five distinct, yet geographically related, groups of countries. Specifically, the economic wealth of a nation was predictive of the average navigation ability of its inhabitants, and gender inequality was predictive of the size of performance difference between males and females. Thus, cognitive abilities, at least for spatial navigation, are clustered according to economic wealth and gender inequalities globally, which has significant implications for cross-cultural studies and multi-centre clinical trials using cognitive testing.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic information can be inherited for multiple generations (termed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance or TEI) 1,2. Non-coding RNAs have emerged as important mediators of TEI, although the mechanism(s) by which non-coding RNAs mediate TEI remains poorly understood. dsRNA-mediated gene silencing (RNAi) in C. elegans is a robust example of RNA-directed TEI3-5. To further our understanding of RNA-directed TEI, we conducted a genetic screen in C. elegans to identify genes required for RNAi inheritance. Our screen identified the conserved RNA helicase/Zn finger protein ZNFX-1 and the Argonaute protein WAGO-4. We find that WAGO-4 and ZNFX-1 act cooperatively in inheriting generations to maintain small interfering (si)RNA expression over generational time. ZNFX-1/ WAGO-4 localize to a liquid droplet organelle termed the P granule in early germline blastomeres. Later in development, ZNFX-1/WAGO-4 appear to separate from P granules to form independent foci that are adjacent to, yet remain distinct, from P granules. ZNFX-1/WAGO-4 labeled foci exhibit properties reminiscent of liquid droplets and we name these foci Z granules. In the adult germline, Z granules assemble into ordered tri-droplet assemblages with P granules and another germline droplet-like foci termed the Mutator foci. This work identifies a conserved RNA-binding protein that drives RNA-directed TEI in C. elegans, defines a new germline foci that we term the Z granule, demonstrates that liquid droplet formation is under developmental control, and shows that liquid droplets can assemble into spatially ordered multi-droplet structures. We speculate that temporal and spatial ordering of liquid droplets helps cells organize and coordinate the complex RNA processing pathways underlying gene regulatory systems, such as RNA-directed TEI.",

    "abstract": "This resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) study in tinnitus patients was conducted to observe the spontaneous neural activity of the central auditory system using a derived index, mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF). Tinnitus subjects with right-ear hearing impairment (THL) and without hearing loss (TNH) and two age-, sex-, and education-matched control groups (NC1 and NC2) were recruited for rs-fMRI. mALFF maps of the tinnitus and matched NC groups were plotted in the central auditory system, including the primary auditory cortex (PAC), higher auditory cortex (HAC), and hubs of the central auditory pathway. mALFF values of the activity clusters in the central auditory system of THL and TNH patients were extracted and correlated with each clinical characteristic. Significantly increased mALFF clusters were found in bilateral PAC and HAC of THL-NC1 maps and in the left inferior colliculus and right HAC of TNH-NC2 maps. Thus, subgroups of tinnitus with and without hearing impairment might exhibit different homeostatic plasticity in the central auditory system. mALFF values of aberrant active clusters in the central auditory system are partly associated with specific clinical tinnitus characteristics.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade coffee certification programs have grown rapidly in Latin America, encouraging producers to harvest coffee based on production standards intended to enhance biodiversity conservation. However, few studies have tested whether such programs have a positive conservation impact. To date, research has focused on comparing community similarity between forests and plantations, but the question of whether certified plantations provide refuges for biodiversity in regions where all the forest has been lost remains untested. Here, we compare bird, butterfly and plant communities in highly deforested regions in Santander, Colombia, to determine the potential conservation role of two certification programs: Rainforest Alliance and Rainforest Alliance+Organic. We used 13 farms to census birds, butterflies, and trees, and quantified structural characteristics of the shade. We found little difference in most measures of diversity and composition of birds, butterfly and plant communities between types of plantations. However, despite high variation across farms, butterfly richness and abundance increased with the decrease in the use of pesticides in plantations. These results suggest that reduced use of chemical compounds in certified coffee plantations might enhance conservation of butterfly communities. The biodiversity associated with these coffee plantations and the high deforestation rates in Santander, suggest that irrespective of their certification type they provide the last refuges for biodiversity conservation in this region.",

    "abstract": "One of the main goals of community ecology is to understand the influence of the abiotic environment on the abundance and distribution of species. It has been hypothesized that dry forests are harsher environments than wet forests, which leads to the prediction that environmental filtering should be a more important determinant of patterns of species abundance and composition than in wet forest, where biotic interactions or random assembly should be more important. We attempt to understand the influence of rainfall on the abundance and distribution of bird species along a steep precipitation gradient in an inter-Andean valley in Colombia. We gathered data on species distributions, abundance, morphological traits and phylogenetic relationships to determine the influence of rainfall on the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic turnover of species along the Magdalena Valley. We demonstrate that there is a strong turnover of community composition at the limit of the dry forest. The taxonomic turnover is steeper than the phylogenetic turnover, suggesting that replacement of closely related species accounts for a disproportionate number of changes along the gradient. We found evidence for environmental filtering in dry forest as species tend to be more tolerant of higher temperature ranges, stronger rainfall seasonality and lower minimum rainfall. On the other hand, wet forest species tend to compete actively for nest space but not for the resources associated with the axes we measured. Our results suggest that rainfall is a strong determinant of community composition when comparing localities above and below the 2400 mm rainfall isocline.",

    "abstract": "For cells to grow faster they must increase their protein production rate. Microorganisms have traditionally been thought to accomplish this increase by producing more ribosomes to enhance protein synthesis capacity, leading to the linear relationship between ribosome level and growth rate observed under most growth conditions previously examined. Past studies have suggested that this linear relationship represents an optimal resource allocation strategy for each growth rate, independent of any specific nutrient state. Here we investigate protein production strategies in continuous cultures limited for carbon, nitrogen, and phosphate, which differentially impact substrate supply for protein versus nucleic acid metabolism. Unexpectedly, we find that at slow growth rates, E. coli achieves the same protein production rate using three different strategies under the three different nutrient limitations. Upon phosphate (P) limitation, translation is slow due to a particularly low abundance of ribosomes, which are RNA-rich and thus particularly costly for phosphorous-limited cells. In nitrogen (N) limitation, translation is slowed by limited glutamine and stalling at glutamine codons, resulting is slow elongation. In carbon (C) limitation, translation is slowed by accumulation of inactive ribosomes not bound to mRNA. These extra ribosomes enable rapid growth acceleration upon nutrient upshift. Thus, bacteria tune ribosome usage across different limiting nutrients to enable balanced nutrient-limited growth while also preparing for future nutrient upshifts.",

    "abstract": "Selective control of action potential generation in individual cells from a neuronal ensemble is desirable for dissecting circuit mechanisms underlying perception and behavior. Here, by using two-photon (2P) temporally focused computer-generated holography (TF-CGH), we demonstrate optical manipulation of neuronal excitability at the supragranular layers of anesthetized mouse visual cortex. Utilizing amplified laser-pulses delivered via a localized holographic spot, our optical system achieves suprathreshold activation by exciting either of the three optogenetic actuators, ReaChR, CoChR or ChrimsonR, with brief illumination ([&le;] 10 ms) at moderate excitation power ((in average [&le;] 0.2 mW/m2 corresponding to [&le;] 25 mW/cell). Using 2P-guided whole-cell or cell-attached recordings in positive neurons expressing respective opsin in vivo, we find that parallel illumination induces spikes of millisecond temporal resolution and sub-millisecond precision, which are preserved upon repetitive illuminations up to tens of Hz. Holographic stimulation thus enables temporally precise optogenetic activation independently of opsins channel kinetics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that parallel optogenetic activation can be combined with functional imaging for all-optical control of a neuronal sub-population that co-expresses the photosensitive opsin ReaChR and the calcium indicator GCaMP6s. Parallel optical control of neuronal activity with cellular resolution and millisecond temporal precision should be advantageous for investigating neuronal connections and further yielding causal links between connectivity, microcircuit dynamics, and brain functions.",

    "abstract": "Cell fate decisions play a pivotal role in development but technologies for dissecting them are limited. We developed a multifunction new method, Topographer to construct a  quantitative Waddingtons landscape of single-cell transcriptomic data. This method is able to identify complex cell-state transition trajectories and to estimate complex cell-type dynamics characterized by fate and transition probabilities. It also infers both marker gene networks and their dynamic changes as well as dynamic characteristics of transcriptional bursting along the cell-state transition trajectories. Applying this method to single-cell RNA-seq data on the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, we not only identified three known cell types but also estimated both their fate probabilities and transition probabilities among them. We found that the percent of genes expressed in a bursty manner is significantly higher at (or near) the branch point ([~]97%) than before or after branch (below 80%), and that both gene-gene and cell-cell correlation degrees are apparently lower near the branch point than away from the branching. Topographer allows revealing of cell fate mechanisms in a coherent way at three scales: cell lineage (macroscopic), gene network (mesoscopic) and gene expression (microscopic).",
