    "abstract": "With the advances in diffusion MRI and tractography, numerous atlases of the human pyramidal tract (PyT) have been proposed but the inherent limitation of tractography to resolve crossing bundles within the centrum semiovale have so far prevented the complete description of the most lateral PyT projections. Here, we combined a precise manual positioning of individual subcortical regions of interest along the descending pathway of the PyT with a new bundle-specific tractography algorithm. This later is based on anatomical priors to improve streamlines tracking in crossing areas. We then extracted both left and right PyT in a large cohort of 410 healthy participants and built a population-based atlas of the whole-fanning PyT with a complete description of its most cortico-lateral projections. Clinical applications are envisaged, the whole-fanning PyT atlas being likely a better marker of corticospinal integrity metrics than those currently used within the frame of prediction of post-stroke motor recovery. The present population-based PyT, freely available, provides an interesting tool for clinical applications in order to locate specific PyT damage and its impact to the short and long-term motor recovery after stroke.",

    "abstract": "Detailed mapping of genetic and environmental influences on the functional connectome is a crucial step toward developing intermediate phenotypes between genes and clinical diagnoses or cognitive abilities. We analyze resting-state data from two, adult twin samples - 390 twins from the Colorado Longitudinal Twin Sample and 422 twins from the Human Connectome Project - to examine genetic and environmental influence on all pairwise functional connections between 264 brain regions (~35,000 functional connections). Non-shared environmental influence was high, genetic influence was moderate, and shared environmental influence was weak-to-moderate across the connectome. The brains genetic organization is diverse and not as one would expect based solely on structure evident in non-genetically informative data or lower-resolution data. As follow-up, we make novel classifications of functional connections and examine highly-localized connections with particularly strong genetic influence. This high-resolution genetic taxonomy of brain connectivity will be useful in understanding genetic influences on brain disorders.",

    "abstract": "The computations underlying cognitive strategies in sensorimotor learning are poorly understood. Here we investigate such strategies in a sensorimotor transformation task. We show that strategies assume two forms, reflecting distinct working memory representations: discrete response caching of stimulus-response contingencies (e.g., look-up table; RC), and time-consuming parametric computations (e.g. mental rotation; MR). Subjects reaction times and errors suggest that both strategies are employed during learning, and trade off based on the progress of learning and the complexity of the task. Experiments using pressured preparation time support these working memory mechanisms: In discrete RC, time pressure elicits bimodal distributions of movements, in agreement with cached responses; in parametric MR, time pressure elicits a shifting distribution producing intermediate movements between visual targets and distal goals, consistent with analog re-computing of a movement plan. These results provide a specific model of working memory contributions to motor learning.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPhysiological regulators of life history trade-offs need to be responsive to sudden changes of resource availability. When homeostasis is challenged by unpredictable stressors, vertebrates respond through a set of physiological reactions, which can promote organismal survival. Glucocorticoids have been traditionally recognized as one of the main regulators of the physiological stress response, but the role of an evolutionarily more conserved pathway, the hypothalamic-pituitary-somatotropic (HPS) axis producing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) has received much less attention. Although IGF-1 is known to affect several life history traits, little is known about its role in the physiological stress response and it has never been studied directly in adult wild animals.\\n\\nMethodsIn this study, we combined field observations with a controlled experiment to investigate how circulating levels of IGF-1 change in response to stress and whether this change is due to concomitant change in glucocorticoids in a free-living songbird, the bearded reedling Panurus biarmicus. We used a standard capture-restraint protocol in field observation, in which we took first and second (stress induced: 15 minutes later) samples. In a follow-up experiment, we used a minimally invasive oral corticosterone manipulation.\\n\\nResultsWe showed that corticosterone levels significantly increased while IGF-1 levels significantly decreased during capture and handling stress. However, change in corticosterone levels were not related to change in IGF-1 levels. We found that experimentally elevated corticosterone levels did not affect IGF-1 levels.\\n\\nDiscussionOur results are the first to highlight that circulating IGF-1 levels are responsive to stress independently from glucocorticoids and suggest that the HPS axis is an autonomous physiological pathway that may play an important role as regulator of life-history decisions.",

    "abstract": "Identifying gene expression programs underlying both cell-type identity and cellular activities (e.g. life-cycle processes, responses to environmental cues) is crucial for understanding the organization of cells and tissues. Although single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) can quantify transcripts in individual cells, each cells expression profile may be a mixture of both types of programs, making them difficult to disentangle. Here we illustrate and enhance the use of matrix factorization as a solution to this problem. We show with simulations that a method that we call consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF) accurately infers identity and activity programs, including the relative contribution of programs in each cell. Applied to published brain organoid and visual cortex scRNA-Seq datasets, cNMF refines the hierarchy of cell types and identifies both expected (e.g. cell cycle and hypoxia) and intriguing novel activity programs. We propose that one of the novel programs may reflect a neurosecretory phenotype and a second may underlie the formation of neuronal synapses. We make cNMF available to the community and illustrate how this approach can provide key insights into gene expression variation within and between cell types.",

    "abstract": "Nepotism and reciprocity are not mutually exclusive explanations for cooperation, because helping decisions can depend on both kinship cues and past reciprocal help. The importance of these two factors can therefore be difficult to disentangle using observational data. We developed a resampling procedure for inferring the statistical power to detect observational evidence of nepotism and reciprocity. We first applied this procedure to simulated datasets resulting from perfect reciprocity, where the probability and duration of helping events from individual A to B equaled that from B to A. We then assessed how the probability of detecting correlational evidence of reciprocity was influenced by (1) the number of helping observations and (2) varying degrees of simultaneous nepotism. Last, we applied the same analysis to empirical data on food sharing in vampire bats and allogrooming in mandrills and Japanese macaques. We show that at smaller sample sizes, the effect of kinship was easier to detect and the relative role of kinship was overestimated compared to the effect of reciprocal help in both simulated and empirical data, even with data simulating perfect reciprocity and imperfect nepotism. We explain the causes and consequences of this difference in power for detecting the roles of kinship versus reciprocal help. To compare the relative importance of genetic and social relationships, we therefore suggest that researchers measure the relative reliability of both coefficients in the model by plotting these coefficients and their detection probability as a function of sampling effort. We provide R scripts to allow others to do this power analysis with their own datasets.",

To facilitate further population genetics and genomic studies, here we present a reference genome assembly for the European subspecies (H. r. rustica).\\n\\nFindingsAs part of the Genome10K (G10K) effort on generating high quality vertebrate genomes, we have assembled a highly contiguous genome assembly using Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) DNA sequencing and several Bionano optical map technologies. We compared and integrated optical maps derived both from the Nick, Label, Repair and Stain and from the Direct Label and Stain (DLS) technologies. As proposed by Bionano, the DLS more than doubled the scaffold N50 with respect to the nickase. The dual enzyme hybrid scaffold led to a further marginal increase in scaffold N50 and an overall increase of confidence in the scaffolds. After removal of haplotigs, the final assembly is approximately 1.21 Gbp in size, with a scaffold N50 value of over 25.95 Mbp.\\n\\nConclusionsThis high-quality genome assembly represents a valuable resource for further studies of population genetics and genomics in the barn swallow, and for studies concerning the evolution of avian genomes. It also represents one of the very first genomes assembled by combining SMRT long-read sequencing with the new Bionano DLS technology for scaffolding. The quality of this assembly demonstrates the potential of this methodology to substantially increase the contiguity of genome assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Pathologists are responsible for rapidly providing a diagnosis on critical health issues. Challenging cases benefit from additional opinions of pathologist colleagues. In addition to on-site colleagues, there is an active worldwide community of pathologists on social media for complementary opinions. Such access to pathologists worldwide has the capacity to improve diagnostic accuracy and generate broader consensus on next steps in patient care. From Twitter we curate 13,626 images from 6,351 tweets from 25 pathologists from 13 countries. We supplement the Twitter data with 113,161 images from 1,074,484 PubMed articles. We develop machine learning and deep learning models to (i) accurately identify histopathology stains, (ii) discriminate between tissues, and (iii) differentiate disease states. Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic is 0.805-0.996 for these tasks. We repurpose the disease classifier to search for similar disease states given an image and clinical covariates. We report precision@k=1 = 0.7618{+/-}0.0018 (chance 0.397{+/-}0.004, mean{+/-}stdev). The classifiers find texture and tissue are important clinico-visual features of disease. Deep features trained only on natural images (e.g. cats and dogs) substantially improved search performance, while pathology-specific deep features and cell nuclei features further improved search to a lesser extent. We implement a social media bot (@pathobot on Twitter) to use the trained classifiers to aid pathologists in obtaining real-time feedback on challenging cases. If a social media post containing pathology text and images mentions the bot, the bot generates quantitative predictions of disease state (normal/artifact/infection/injury/nontumor, pre-neoplastic/benign/ low-grade-malignant-potential, or malignant) and lists similar cases across social media and PubMed. Our project has become a globally distributed expert system that facilitates pathological diagnosis and brings expertise to underserved regions or hospitals with less expertise in a particular disease. This is the first pan-tissue pan-disease (i.e. from infection to malignancy) method for prediction and search on social media, and the first pathology study prospectively tested in public on social media. We will share data through pathobotology.org. We expect our project to cultivate a more connected world of physicians and improve patient care worldwide.",

We built a new lipid ontology (LION) that associates over 50,000 lipid species to biophysical, chemical and cell biological features. By making use of enrichment algorithms, we used LION to develop a web-based interface (LION/web, www.lipidontology.com) that allows identification of lipid-associated terms in lipidomes. LION/web was validated by analyzing a lipidomic dataset derived from well-characterized sub-cellular fractions of RAW 264.7 macrophages. Comparison of isolated plasma membranes with the microsomal fraction showed a significant enrichment of relevant LION-terms including  plasma membrane,  headgroup with negative charge,  glycerophosphoserines,  above average bilayer thickness, and  below average lateral diffusion. A second validation was performed by analyzing the membrane fluidity of CHO cells incubated with arachidonic acid. An increase in membrane fluidity was observed both experimentally by using pyrene decanoic acid and by using LION/web, showing significant enrichment of terms associated with high membrane fluidity ('above average, 'very high and 'high lateral diffusion, and 'below average transition temperature). The results demonstrate the functionality of LION/web, which is freely accessible in a platform-independent way.",

    "abstract": "Cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) networks are critical for adaptive decision-making, yet how changes to circuit-level properties impact cognitive algorithms remains unclear. Here we explore how dopaminergic plasticity at corticostriatal synapses alters competition between striatal pathways, impacting the evidence accumulation process during decision-making. Spike-timing dependent plasticity simulations showed that dopaminergic feedback based on rewards modified the ratio of direct and indirect corticostriatal weights within opposing action channels. Using the learned weight ratios in a full spiking CBGT network model, we simulated neural dynamics and decision outcomes in a reward-driven decision task and fit them with a drift diffusion model. Fits revealed that the rate of evidence accumulation varied with inter-channel differences in direct pathway activity while boundary height varied with overall indirect pathway activity. This multi-level modeling approach demonstrates how complementary learning and decision computations can emerge from corticostriatal plasticity.\n\nAuthor summaryCognitive process models such as reinforcement learning (RL) and the drift diffusion model (DDM) have helped to elucidate the basic algorithms underlying error-corrective learning and the evaluation of accumulating decision evidence leading up to a choice. While these relatively abstract models help to guide experimental and theoretical probes into associated phenomena, they remain uninformative about the actual physical mechanics by which learning and decision algorithms are carried out in a neurobiological substrate during adaptive choice behavior. Here we present an \"upwards mapping\" approach to bridging neural and cognitive models of value-based decision-making, showing how dopaminergic feedback alters the network-level dynamics of cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) pathways during learning to bias behavioral choice towards more rewarding actions. By mapping \"up\" the levels of analysis, this approach yields specific predictions about aspects of neuronal activity that map to the quantities appearing in the cognitive decision-making framework.",

    "abstract": "Colour polymorphisms play a key role in sexual selection and speciation, yet the mechanisms that generate and maintain them are not fully understood. We therefore used genomic and transcriptomic tools to identify the precise genetic architecture and evolutionary history of a sex-linked colour polymorphism in the Gouldian finch Erythrura gouldiae that is also accompanied by remarkable differences in behaviour and physiology. We found that differences in colour are associated with an ~72-kbp region of the Z chromosome in a putative regulatory region for follistatin, an antagonist of the TGF-{beta} superfamily genes. The region is highly differentiated between morphs, unlike the rest of the genome, yet we found no evidence that an inversion is involved in maintaining the distinct haplotypes. Coalescent simulations confirm that that there is elevated nucleotide diversity and an excess of intermediate frequency alleles at this locus. We conclude that this pleiotropic colour polymorphism is most probably maintained by balancing selection.",

    "abstract": "Major advances in crop yield are eternally needed to cope with population growth. To balance vegetative and reproductive growth plays an important role in agricultural yield. To extend vegetative phase can increase crop yield, however, this strategy risks loss of yield in the field as crops may not mature in time before winter come. Here, we identified a repression feedback loop between GmFTL/GmFDL and GmGRF5-1 (Glycine-max-Flowering-Locus-T/Glycine-max-FDL and Glycine-max-GROWTH-REGULATING-FACTOR5-1), which functions as a pivotal regulator in balancing vegetative and reproductive phases in soybean. GmFTL/GmFDL and GmGRF5-1 directly repress gene expression each other. Additionally, GmGRF5-1 enhances vegetative growth by directly enhancing expression of photosynthesis- and auxin synthesis-related genes. To modulate the loop, such as fine-tuning GmFTL expression to trade-off vegetative and reproductive growth, increases substantially soybean yield in the field. Our findings not only uncover the mechanism balancing vegetative and reproductive growth, but open a new window to improve crop yield.",

The chloroplast and mitochondria are centres of metabolic control and ROS production, which coordinate stress responses in other cell compartments. The herbicide and experimental tool, methyl viologen (MV) induces ROS generation in the chloroplast under illumination, but is also toxic in non-photosynthetic organisms. We used MV to probe plant ROS signalling in compartments other than the chloroplast. Taking a genetic approach in Arabidopsis thaliana, we used natural variation, QTL mapping, and mutant studies with MV in the light, but also under dark conditions, when the chloroplast electron transport is inactive. These studies revealed a light-independent MV-induced ROS-signalling pathway, suggesting mitochondrial involvement. Mitochondrial Mn SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE was required for ROS-tolerance and the effect of MV was enhanced by exogenous sugar, providing further evidence for the role of mitochondria. Mutant and hormone feeding assays revealed roles for stress hormones in organellar ROS-responses. The radical-induced cell death1 mutant, which is tolerant to MV-induced ROS and exhibits altered mitochondrial signalling, was used to probe interactions between organelles. Our studies implicate mitochondria in the response to ROS induced by MV.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation of cytosine residues across the genome influences how genes and phenotypes are regulated in a wide range of organisms. As such, understanding the role of DNA methylation and other epigenetic mechanisms has become very much a part of mapping genotype to phenotype, a major question in evolutionary biology. Ideally, we would like to manipulate DNA methylation patterns on a genome-wide scale, to help us to elucidate the role that epigenetic modifications play in phenotypic expression. Recently, the demethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC; commonly used in the epigenetic treatment of certain cancers), has been deployed to explore the epigenetic regulation of a number of traits of interest to evolutionary ecologists, including facultative sex allocation in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. In a recent study, we showed that treatment with 5-aza-dC did not ablate the facultative sex allocation response in Nasonia, but shifted the patterns of sex allocation in a way predicted by genomic conflict theory. This was the first (albeit indirect) experimental evidence for genomic conflict over sex allocation facilitated by DNA methylation. However, that work lacked direct evidence of the effects of 5-aza-dC on DNA methylation, and indeed the effect of the chemical has since been questioned in Nasonia. Here, using whole-genome bisulphite sequencing of more than 4 million CpGs, across more than 11,000 genes, we demonstrate unequivocally that 5-aza-dC disrupts methylation on a large scale across the Nasonia vitripennis genome. We show that the disruption can lead to both hypo- and hyper-methylation, may vary across tissues and time of sampling, and that the effects of 5-aza-dC are context- and sequence specific. We conclude that 5-aza-dC does indeed have the potential to be repurposed as a tool for studying the role of DNA methylation in evolutionary ecology, whilst many details of its action remain to be discovered.\n\nAuthor SummaryShedding light on the mechanistic basis of phenotypes is a major aim in the field of evolutionary biology. If we understand how phenotypes are controlled at the molecular level, we can begin to understand how evolution has shaped that phenotype and conversely, how genetic architecture may constrain trait evolution. Epigenetic markers (such as DNA methylation) also influence phenotypic expression by regulating how and when genes are expressed. Recently, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), a hypomethylating agent used in the treatment of certain cancers, has been used to explore the epigenetic regulation of traits of interest to evolutionary ecologists. Previously, we used 5-aza-dC to validate a role for DNA methylation in facultative sex allocation behaviour in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. However, the direct effects of the chemical were not examined at that point and its efficacy in insects was questioned. Here, we demonstrate that 5-aza-dC disrupts DNA methylation on a genome-wide scale in a context- and sequence-specific manner and results in both hypo- and hyper-methylation. Our work demonstrates that 5-aza-dC has the potential to be repurposed as a tool for studying the role of DNA methylation in phenotypic expression.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian molecular dating is widely used to study evolutionary timescales. This procedure usually involves phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequence data, with fossil-based calibrations applied as age constraints on internal nodes of the tree. An alternative approach is Bayesian total-evidence dating, which involves the joint analysis of molecular data from present-day taxa and morphological data from both extant and fossil taxa. Part of its appeal stems from the fossilized birth-death process, which provides a model of lineage diversification for the prior on the tree topology and node times. However, total-evidence dating faces a number of considerable challenges, especially those associated with fossil sampling and evolutionary models for morphological characters. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the performance of total-evidence dating with the fossilized birth-death model. We simulated fossil occurrences and the evolution of nucleotide sequences and morphological characters under a wide range of conditions. Our analyses show that fossil occurrences have a greater influence than the degree of among-lineage rate variation or the number of morphological characters on estimates of node times and the tree topology. Total-evidence dating generally performs well in recovering the relationships among extant taxa, but has difficulties in correctly placing fossil taxa in the tree and identifying the number of sampled ancestors. The method yields accurate estimates of the origin time of the fossilized birth-death process and the ages of the root and crown group, although the precision of these estimates varies with the probability of fossil occurrence. The exclusion of morphological characters results in a slight overestimation of node times, whereas the exclusion of nucleotide sequences has a negative impact on inference of the tree topology. Overall, our results provide a detailed view of the performance of total-evidence dating, which will inform further development of the method and its application to key questions in evolutionary biology.",

Synergistic activation of canonical inflammatory NF-{kappa}B target genes by IFN-{gamma} and LPS is well appreciated, but less is known about whether IFN-{gamma} negatively regulates components of the LPS response, and how this affects polarization. A combined transcriptomic and epigenomic approach revealed that IFN-{gamma} selectively abrogates LPS-induced feedback and select metabolic pathways by suppressing TLR4-mediated activation of gene enhancers. In contrast to superinduction of inflammatory genes via enhancers that harbor IRF sequences and bind STAT1, IFN-{gamma}-mediated repression targeted enhancers with STAT sequences that bound STAT3. TLR4-activated IFN-{gamma}-suppressed enhancers comprised two subsets distinguished by differential regulation of histone acetylation and recruitment of STAT3, CDK8 and cohesin, and were functionally inactivated by IFN-{gamma}. These findings reveal that IFN-{gamma} suppresses feedback inhibitory and metabolic components of the TLR response to achieve full M1 polarization, and provide insights into mechanisms by which IFN-{gamma} selectively inhibits TLR4-induced transcription.",

Here we develop a new approach to assess how the genetic variation inherent in viral populations contributes to this heterogeneity. We do this by determining both the transcriptome and full-length sequences of all viral genes in single influenza-infected cells. Most cells are infected by virions with defects such as amino-acid mutations, internal deletions, or failure to express a gene. We identify instances of each type of defect that increase the likelihood that a cell activates an innate-immune response. However, immune activation remains stochastic in cells infected by virions with these defects, and sometimes occurs even when a cell is infected by a virion that expresses unmutated copies of all genes. Our work shows that viral genetic variation substantially contributes to but does not fully explain the heterogeneity in single influenza-infected cells.",

We investigated the metabolomics of age and sex using longitudinal plasma samples from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimers Prevention (WRAP), a cohort of participants who were dementia free at enrollment. Metabolomic profiles were quantified for 2,316 fasting plasma samples among 1,187 participants, each with up to three study visits. Of 1,097 metabolites tested, 608 (55.4%) were associated with age and 680 (62.0%) with sex after correcting for multiple testing. Approximately twice as many metabolites were associated with age in stratified analyses of women versus men, and 63 metabolite trajectories significantly differed by sex, most notably including sphingolipids, which tended to increase in women and decrease in men with age. Using genome-wide genotyping, we also report the heritabilities of metabolites investigated, which ranged dramatically (0.2-99.2%); however, the median heritability of 36.2% suggests that many metabolites are highly influenced by a complex combination of genomic and environmental influences. These findings offer a more profound description of the aging process and may inform many new hypotheses regarding the role metabolites play in healthy and accelerated aging.",

While the utility of circumnutation for climbing plants is clear, its function in roots is less obvious. Additionally, the genetic requirements for root circumnutation are not known. Here we show that mutations in a gene encoding a histidine kinase abolish large radius root tip circumnutation in rice. Using a gel-based imaging system and a whole genome sequenced mutant population, we identified three different mutant alleles of the gene OsHK1 that exhibit increased seedling root depth. Time-lapse imaging indicated that this phenotype is likely due to a lack of large radius root tip circumnutation in OsHK1 mutants. Treatment of mutant roots with the plant hormone zeatin rescues circumnutation, indicating that OsHK1 functions in a cytokinin-related signaling pathway. We found that OsHK1 mutants are impaired in their ability to explore flat surfaces, suggesting that circumnutation facilitates root exploration at the interface of compacted soil horizons.",

    "abstract": "Sinorhizobium meliloti is a soil dwelling bacteria capable of forming a symbiotic relationship with several legume hosts. Once symbiosis is established, S. meliloti fixes atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogenated compounds, thus carrying out an important step in the nitrogen cycle. S. meliloti is also capable of the reverse process, denitrification, the reduction of nitrate and nitrite to nitrogen gas. In this study we have identified a novel regulator of denitrification in S. meliloti, Adr, which affects the expression of the denitrification genes in aerobically grown cultures. Analysis of the Adr sequence reveals a LuxR-like quorum sensing regulator, however, it does not respond to the known quorum sensing signals produced by S. meliloti. Additionally, we show that FixJ, the major regulator of denitrification and microaerobic respiration in S. meliloti, is active under our growth conditions. Comparison of the FixJ microarray to our Adr microarray shows a significant overlap between the two regulons. We also show that while Adr is not necessary for symbiotic nitrogen fixation, a functional copy of this regulator confers a competitive advantage to S. meliloti during host invasion. Our findings suggest that Adr is a new type of denitrification regulator and that it acts at the same regulatory level as FixJ.\\n\\nImportanceRhizobia contribute to the nitrogen cycle by fixing atmospheric nitrogen to nitrogenated compounds and by denitrification, the reduction nitrate and nitrite to nitrogen gas. Denitrification enhances the survival of Sinorhizobium meliloti in the various environments it may encounter, such as free-living conditions in the rhizosphere, during invasion of the plant host, and after a symbiotic relationship has been established. Oxygen concentration is the typical signal for denitrification gene expression. Recent studies of low oxygen cultures of S. meliloti have outlined the regulation structure for denitrification. In this study, we examine the regulation of denitrification in aerobically grown S. meliloti cultures. Understanding how S. meliloti responds to various oxygen concentrations will result in a more complete picture of denitrification regulation in this agriculturally important organism and the impact of denitrification on the soil microbiome as a whole.",

    "abstract": "The free-living soil bacteria that are beneficial for the growth of plants are known as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). In this work, a multi-species of PGPR bacteria inoculant was designed, which included nitrogen-fixing strains such as Rhizobium phaseoli, Sinorhizobium americanum and Azospirillum brasilense, as well as other plant growth promoting bacteria such as Bacillus subtillis and Methylobacterium extorquens. The multi-species community exerted a beneficial effect on plant seedlings when it was inoculated, greater than the effect observed when inoculating each bacteria individually. Acetylene reduction of maize roots was recorded with the multi-species inoculant, which suggests that nitrogen fixation occurred under these conditions. To analyze the contributions of the different nitrogen-fixing bacteria that were inoculated, a metatranscriptomic analysis was performed. The differential expression analysis revealed that the predominantly nif transcripts of Azospirillum are overexpressed, suggesting that it was responsible for nitrogen fixation in maize. Overall, we analyzed the interaction of a synthetic community, suggesting it as an option, for future formulations of biofertilizers.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEWhile nodulation processes and nitrogen fixation by rhizobia have been well studied, little is known about the interaction between rhizobia and non-leguminous plants such as maize, which is used as a model for this study. Nitrogen fixation in cereals is a long searched goal. Instead of single species inoculants, multi-species inoculation may be more efficient to promote plant growth and fix nitrogen. Metatrascriptomes allowed us to recognize the bacteria responsible for nitrogen fixation in plant rootlets. The study of the function of certain genes may help to understand how microorganisms interact with the root plant, as well as allow a better use of microorganisms for the generation of novel biofertilizers using microbial consortia.",

    "abstract": "Why warning patterns are so diverse is an enduring evolutionary problem. Because predators learn to associate particular patterns with unpleasant experiences, an individuals risk of predation should decrease as the local density of its warning pattern increases. Heliconius butterflies, however, are known for their diversity of warning patterns, and the establishment of entirely new phenotypes is difficult to explain under strict frequency-dependent selection. One possibility is that during periods of relaxed selection, drift may allow new variants to rise above a threshold density until mimicry selection takes over. We propose an alternative hypothesis where novel pattern phenotypes arise due to a conflict of interests between the sexes. It is well established that male Heliconius use warning patterns as a mating cue. This will likely be beneficial to males as it will increase the efficiency of finding mates. However, already mated females may suffer fitness costs if these cues lead to harassment by males during oviposition or foraging. When constraints imposed by predation are locally relaxed, this could lead to rapid divergence in pattern phenotypes through chase-away sexual selection. To begin to test this hypothesis, we experimentally manipulated the warning patterns of mated Heliconius erato demaphoon females and recorded their interactions with conspecific males, and the effect of male presence on laying rate. As predicted, males interacted less with mated females whose red forewing band was blacked-out, as compared to control females whose warning pattern remained intact. We also show that females lay less eggs in the presence of males, but we were unable to detect a significant interaction between warning pattern treatment and the presence of males on female fecundity. Our results suggest that male attraction to conspecific warning patterns, may impose a previously unrecognized cost on Heliconius females.",

    "abstract": "1With the advent of deep sequencing techniques, it is now possible to track the evolution of viruses with ever-increasing detail. Here we present FITS (Flexible Inference from Time-Series) - a computational framework that allows inference of either the fitness of a mutation, the mutation rate or the population size from genomic time-series sequencing data. FITS was designed first and foremost for analysis of either short-term Evolve & Resequence (E&R) experiments, or for rapidly recombining populations of viruses. We thoroughly explore the performance of FITS on noisy simulated data, and highlight its ability to infer meaningful information even in those circumstances. In particular FITS is able to categorize a mutation as Advantageous, Neutral or Deleterious. We next apply FITS to empirical data from an E&R experiment on poliovirus where parameters were determined experimentally and demonstrate extremely high accuracy in inference. We highlight the ease of use of FITS for step-wise or iterative inference of mutation rates, population size, and fitness values for each mutation sequenced, when deep sequencing data is available at multiple time-points.\\n\\nAvailabilityFITS is written in C++ and is available both with a highly user friendly graphical user interface but also as a command line program that allows parallel high throughput analyses.

    "abstract": "Chlamydia is a common pathogen that can causes serious complications in the reproductive system and eyes. Lack of vaccine and other effective prophylactic measures coupled with the largely asymptomatic nature and unrare clinical treatment failure calls for development of new antichlamydials, particularly selective antichlamydials without adverse effects on humans and the beneficial microbiota. We previously reported that benzal-N-acylhydrazones (BAH) can inhibit chlamydiae without detectable adverse effects on host cells and beneficial lactobacilli that dominate the human vaginal microbiota among reproductive-age women. However, the antichlamydial mechanism of BAH is not known. Whereas 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (i.e., SNP1-4) were identified in a rare Chlamydia variant with a low level of BAH resistance, termed MCR, previous studies failed to establish a causal effect of any particular SNP(s). In the present work, we performed recombination to segregate the four SNPs. Susceptibility tests indicate that the R51G GrgA allele is both necessary and sufficient for the low level of BAH resistance. Thus, the Chlamydia-specific transcription factor GrgA either is a direct target of BAH or regulates BAH susceptibility. We further confirm an extremely low rate of BAH resistance in Chlamydia. Our findings warrant exploration of GrgA as a therapeutic and prophylactic target for chlamydial infections.",

    "abstract": "Bicelles have been demonstrated to be a valuable tool for studying membrane protein interactions and structure in vitro. They are distinguished by a distinct lipid bilayer that mimics the plasma membrane of cells making it more native-like than its detergent micelle counter-part. Bicelles are typically comprised of a long-chain phospholipid such as dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and a short-chain phospholipid such as dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC). When mixed together in solution DMPC-DHPC bicelles assume a discoidal structure comprised of a heterogeneous arrangement where the short-chain lipids gather around the rim of the disk and the long-chain lipids form the flat, planar, bilayer region. In this study, the nonionic surfactant, C8E5, was used to prepare mixtures with DMPC to determine if it adopts properties similar to bicelles with a q [&ge;] 0.5. At q [&ge;] 0.5, DMPC-DHPC bicelles are bilayered and DMPC is sequestered from the detergent micelle-like DHPC. Mixtures of DMPC and C8E5 were prepared at various q values, a parameter used to describe the mole ratio of DMPC to DHPC in the preparation of bicelles. Employing biophysical methods like dynamic light scattering, 31P-NMR and analytical ultracentrifugation, properties of these lipid-detergent complexes are described. Interestingly they adopted a spherical-shaped micellar structure morphology and did not assume a discoidal shape typical of bicelles at q [&ge;] 0.5. However, they appear to retain bilayer-like properties that may prove beneficial for in vitro biophysical studies of membrane proteins.",

Such a marker, specifically one that would allow an early identification of animals with high feed efficiency for future breeding efforts, would facilitate increasing the profitability of cattle operations and simultaneously render them more sustainable by reducing their methane footprint. The work presented here suggests that Prevotella copri might be an ideal microbial marker for identifying beef cattle with high feed efficiency early in their life span and in the production cycle. Developing more refined quantification techniques that allow correlation of P. copri to feed efficiency of beef cattle that can be applied by lay people in the field holds great promise to improve the economy of cattle operations while simultaneously reducing their environmental impact by mitigating methane production from enteric fermentation.",

    "abstract": "Genes implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are enriched with chromatin regulators, but the mechanisms leading to the abnormal behavior and cognition are still unclear. Animal models are crucial for studying the effects of mutations on brain function and behavior. We generated conditional knockout mice with brain-specific mutation in Pogz, a heterochromatin regulator recurrently mutated in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders, and demonstrated that these mice display phenotypes that resemble the human condition. Pogz deficiency led to smaller brain, growth impairment, motor learning deficits, and increased social interactions that mimic the human overly friendly phenotype. At the molecular level, reporter assay indicated that POGZ functions as a negative regulator of transcription through its interaction with HP1 proteins. In accordance, we found a significant upregulation of gene expression, most notably in the cerebellum. Furthermore, Pogz deficiency was associated with a significant reduction in the firing frequency of simple and complex spikes in cerebellar Purkinje cells with no changes in their intrinsic properties. Overall, our findings support a mechanism linking heterochromatin dysregulation to cerebellar circuit dysfunction and to motor and social abnormalities in ASD.",

    "abstract": "Transcription of eukaryotic protein-coding genes requires passage of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) through chromatin. Pol II passage is impaired by nucleosomes and requires elongation factors that help Pol II to efficiently overcome the nucleosomal barrier1-4. How the Pol II machinery transcribes through a nucleosome remains unclear because structural studies have been limited to Pol II elongation complexes formed on DNA templates lacking nucleosomes5. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of transcribing Pol II from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae engaged with a downstream nucleosome core particle (NCP) at an overall resolution of 4.4 [A] with resolutions ranging from 4-6 [A] in Pol II and 6-8 [A] in the NCP. Pol II and the NCP adopt a defined orientation that could not be predicted from modelling. Pol II contacts DNA of the incoming NCP on both sides of the nucleosomal dyad with its domains  clamp head and  lobe. Comparison of the Pol II-NCP structure to known structures of Pol II complexes reveals that the elongation factors TFIIS, DSIF, NELF, PAF1 complex, and SPT6 can be accommodated on the Pol II surface in the presence of the oriented nucleosome. Further structural comparisons show that the chromatin remodelling enzyme Chd1, which is also required for efficient Pol II passage6,7, could bind the oriented nucleosome with its motor domain. The DNA-binding region of Chd1 must however be released from DNA when Pol II approaches the nucleosome, and based on published data8,9 this is predicted to stimulate Chd1 activity and to facilitate Pol II passage. Our results provide a starting point for a mechanistic analysis of chromatin transcription.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in transcription factor p63 are associated with developmental disorders that manifest defects in stratified epithelia including the epidermis. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanism is however not yet understood. We established an epidermal commitment model using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and characterized differentiation defects of iPSCs derived from ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and cleft lip/palate (EEC) syndrome patients carrying p63 mutations. Transcriptome analyses revealed distinct step-wise cell fate transitions during epidermal commitment; from multipotent simple epithelium to basal stratified epithelia, and ultimately to the mature epidermal fate. Differentiation defects of EEC iPSCs caused by mutant p63 occurred during the specification switch from the simple epithelium to the basal stratified epithelial fate. Single-cell transcriptome and pseudotime analyses identified signatures of embryonic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated with the deviated commitment route of EEC iPSCs. Repressing mesodermal activation reversed the EMT and enhanced epidermal commitment. Our findings demonstrate that p63 is required for specification of stratified epithelia, probably by repressing embryonic EMT during epidermal commitment. This study provides insights into disease mechanisms underlying stratified epithelial defects caused by p63 mutations and suggests potential therapeutic strategies for the disease.\\n\\nSignificance statementMutations in p63 cause several developmental disorders with defects of epithelial related organs and tissues including the epidermis.

Zebrafish has remarkable ability to regenerate its brain by inducing NSC plasticity upon Alzheimers pathology. We recently identified that NSCs enhance their proliferation and neurogenic outcome in an Amyloid-beta42-based (A{beta}42) experimental Alzheimers disease model in zebrafish brain and Interleukin-4 (IL4) is a critical molecule for inducing NSC proliferation in AD conditions. However, the mechanisms by which A{beta}42 and IL4 affect NSCs remained unknown. Using single cell transcriptomics, we determined distinct subtypes of NSCs and neurons in adult zebrafish brain, identified differentially expressed genes after A{beta}42 and IL4 treatments, analyzed the gene ontology and pathways that are affected by A{beta}42 and IL4, and investigated how cell-cell communication is altered through secreted molecules and their receptors. Our results constitute the most extensive resource in the Alzheimers disease model of adult zebrafish brain, are likely to provide unique insights into how A{beta}42/IL4 affects NSC plasticity and yield in novel drug targets for mobilizing neural stem cells for endogenous neuro-regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Ongoing, spontaneous fluctuations in neural excitability and in network-wide activity patterns before stimulus onset have been proposed to underlie variability in near-threshold stimulus detection paradigms, i.e. whether an object is perceived or not. Here, we investigated the impact of pre-stimulus neural fluctuations on the content of perception, i.e. whether one or another object is perceived. We recorded neural activity with magnetoencephalography before and while participants briefly viewed a bi-stable image, the Rubin face/vase illusion, and required them to report their perceived interpretation on each trial. Using multi-variate pattern analysis, we showed robust decoding of the perceptual report during the post-stimulus period. Applying source localization to the classifier weights suggested early recruitment of V1 and ~160 ms recruitment of category-sensitive FFA. These post-stimulus effects were driven by stronger oscillatory power in the gamma frequency band for face vs vase reports. In pre-stimulus intervals, we found no differences in oscillatory power between face vs. vase reports in V1 nor in FFA, indicating similar levels of neural excitability. Despite this, we found stronger connectivity between V1 and FFA prior to face reports for low-frequency oscillations. Specifically, the strength of pre-stimulus feedback connectivity (i.e. Granger causality) from FFA to V1 predicted not only the category of the upcoming percept, but also the strength of post-stimulus neural activity associated with the percept. Our work identifies pre-stimulus network states that shape future processing in category-sensitive brain regions and in this way determine the content of visual experiences.",

These characteristics posit the functional connectome not only as an individual marker but also as a powerful discriminatory measure characterized by high intersubject variability. Among distinct sources of intersubject variability, the long-term sources include functional patterns that emerge from genetic factors. Here, we sought to investigate the contribution of additive genetic factors to the variability of functional networks by determining the heritability of the connectivity strength in a multivariate fashion. First, we reproduced and extended the connectome fingerprinting analysis to the identification of twin pairs. Then, we estimated the heritability of functional networks by a multivariate ACE modeling approach with bootstrapping. Twin pairs were identified above chance level using connectome fingerprinting, with monozygotic twin identification accuracy equal to 57.2% on average for whole-brain connectome. Additionally, we found that a visual (0.37), the medial frontal (0.31) and the motor (0.30) functional networks were the most influenced by additive genetic factors. Our findings suggest that genetic factors not only partially determine intersubject variability of the functional connectome, such that twins can be identified using connectome fingerprinting, but also differentially influence connectivity strength in large-scale functional networks.",

    "abstract": "Reality monitoring is defined as the ability to distinguish internally self-generated information from externally-derived information. Functional imaging studies have consistently found that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a key brain region subserving reality monitoring. The aim of this study was to determine a causal role for mPFC in reality monitoring using navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (nrTMS). In a subject-blinded sham-controlled crossover design, healthy individuals received either active or sham nrTMS targeting mPFC. Active modulation of mPFC using nrTMS at a frequency of 10 Hz, significantly improved identification of both self-generated and externally-derived information during reality monitoring, when compared to sham or baseline. Targeted excitatory modulation of mPFC also improved positive mood ratings, reduced negative mood ratings and increased overall alertness/arousal. These results establish optimal nrTMS dosing parameters that maximized tolerability/comfort and induced significant neuromodulatory effects in the mPFC target. Importantly, this is a proof-of-concept study that establishes the mPFC as a novel brain target that can be stimulated with nrTMS to causally impact both mood and higher-order reality monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Isobaric labeling-based relative quantification techniques such as iTRAQ and TMT were introduced 15 years ago and are now nearly ubiquitous in shotgun proteomics labs around the world. The methods for data processing in these experiments has changed little since inception, with peptide database searching of all MS/MS spectra occurring concurrent or asynchronous to the quantification of the reporter fragment regions. In this study we present an alternative method for data processing whereby the reporter ion region of all MS/MS spectra are first examined and spectra that are not quantitatively interesting to the end user are discarded. The remaining MS/MS spectra that are retained can then be more rapidly searched for computationally expensive database alterations such as post-translational modifications and single amino acid variations in more practical time. We have termed this method Reporter Ion Data Analysis Reduction (RIDAR). To demonstrate the application of RIDAR, we reprocess a recent CPTAC 2 study containing approximately 7.8 million MS/MS spectra. Post RIDAR processing we can search this public dataset versus a human canonical FASTA database and a compiled proteogenomic database of over 875,000 known cancer mutations in a single day on a standard desktop computer, a time reduction of 85% compared to the conventional workflow. With the rapidly increasing size and density of shotgun proteomics data files, RIDAR facilitates rapid analysis of large proteomics datasets for researchers without access to high performance computational resources.\\n\\nAbstract Graphic\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=115 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/437210_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (14K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bcf00eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@134510eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b594b4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@35e268_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Introduced psittacine birds can become highly invasive. In this study, we assessed invasions of Psittaciformes in Puerto Rico. We reviewed the literature, public databases, citizen science records, and performed in situ population surveys across the island to determine the historical and current status and distribution of psittacine species. We used count data from Ebird to determine population trends. For species whose populations were increasing, we modelled their potential distribution using niche modeling techniques. We found 46 Psittaciformes in Puerto Rico, of which 26% are only present as pets, at least 29 species have been reported in the wild, and of those, there is evidence that at least 12 species are breeding. Our results indicate that most introduced species which have been detected as established still persist, although mostly in localized areas and small populations. Clear evidence of invasiveness was found for Brotogeris versicolurus and Myiopsitta monachus, which have greatly expanded their range in recent years. Psittacara erythrogenys and Eupsittacula canicularis also showed population increases, although to a lesser degree. The niche models predicted suitable areas for the four species, and also indicate the potential for range expansion. We discuss the factors leading to invasion success, assess the potential impacts, and we discuss possible management strategies and research prospects.",

    "abstract": "Reality monitoring is defined as the ability to distinguish internally self-generated information from externally-derived information. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a key brain region subserving reality monitoring and has been shown to be activated specifically during the retrieval of self-generated information. However, it is unclear if mPFC is activated during the encoding of self-generated information into memory. If so, it is important to understand whether successful retrieval of self-generated information critically depends on enhanced neural activity within mPFC during initial encoding of this self-generated information.\\n\\nWe used magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEGI) to determine the timing and location of cortical activity during a reality-monitoring task involving self generated contextual source memory encoding and retrieval. We found both during encoding and retrieval of self-generated information, when compared to externally-derived information, mPFC showed significant task induced oscillatory power modulation in the beta-band. During initial encoding of self-generated information, greater mPFC beta-band power reductions occurred within a time window of -700ms to -500ms prior to vocalization, activity in mPFC that was not observed during encoding of externally-derived information. This mPFC activity during encoding of self-generated information predicted subsequent retrieval accuracy of self-generated information. Beta-band activity in mPFC was also observed during the initial retrieval of self-generated information within a time window of 300 to 500ms following stimulus onset and correlated with accurate retrieval performance of self-generated information. Together, these results further highlight the importance of mPFC in mediating the initial generation and awareness of participants internal thoughts.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide accurate identification and quantification of full-length mRNA isoforms is crucial for investigating transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of biological phenomena. Despite continuing efforts in developing effective computational tools to identify or assemble full-length mRNA isoforms from second-generation RNA-seq data, it remains a challenge to accurately identify mRNA isoforms from short sequence reads due to the substantial information loss in RNA-seq experiments. Here we introduce a novel statistical method, AIDE (Annotation-assisted Isoform DiscovEry), the first approach that directly controls false isoform discoveries by implementing the testing-based model selection principle. Solving the isoform discovery problem in a stepwise and conservative manner, AIDE prioritizes the annotated isoforms and precisely identifies novel isoforms whose addition significantly improves the explanation of observed RNA-seq reads. We evaluate the performance of AIDE based on multiple simulated and real RNA-seq datasets followed by a PCR-Sanger sequencing validation. Our results show that AIDE effectively leverages the annotation information to compensate the information loss due to short read lengths. AIDE achieves the highest precision in isoform discovery and the lowest error rates in isoform abundance estimation, compared with three state-of-the-art methods Cufflinks, SLIDE, and StringTie. As a robust bioinformatics tool for transcriptome analysis, AIDE will enable researchers to discover novel transcripts with high confidence.",

    "abstract": "Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\n\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.",

    "abstract": "A signature feature of the neocortex is the dense network of horizontal connections (HCs) through which pyramidal neurons (PNs) exchange \\\"contextual\\\" information. In primary visual cortex (V1), HCs are thought to facilitate boundary detection, a crucial operation for object recognition, but how HCs modulate PN responses to boundary cues within their classical receptive fields (CRF) remains unknown. We began by \\\"asking\\\" natural images, through a structured data collection and ground truth labeling process, what function a V1 cell should use to compute boundary probability from aligned edge cues within and outside its CRF. The \\\"answer\\\" was an asymmetric 2-D sigmoidal function, whose nonlinear form provides the first normative account for the \\\"multiplicative\\\" center-flanker interactions previously reported in V1 neurons (Kapadia et al. 1995, 2000; Polat et al. 1998). Using a detailed compartmental model, we then show that this boundary-detecting classical-contextual interaction function can be computed with near perfect accuracy by NMDAR-dependent spatial synaptic interactions within PN dendrites - the site where classical and contextual inputs first converge in the cortex. In additional simulations, we show that local interneuron circuitry activated by HCs can powerfully leverage the nonlinear spatial computing capabilities of PN dendrites, providing the cortex with a highly flexible substrate for integration of classical and contextual information.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIn addition to the driver inputs that establish their classical receptive fields, cortical pyramidal neurons (PN) receive a much larger number of \\\"contextual\\\" inputs from other PNs through a dense plexus of horizontal connections (HCs). However by what mechanisms, and for what behavioral purposes, HCs modulate PN responses remains unclear. We pursued these questions in the context of object boundary detection in visual cortex, by combining an analysis of natural boundary statistics with detailed modeling PNs and local circuits. We found that nonlinear synaptic interactions in PN dendrites are ideally suited to solve the boundary detection problem. We propose that PN dendrites provide the core computing substrate through which cortical neurons modulate each others responses depending on context.",

    "abstract": "AimChinas Grain-for-Green Program (GFGP) is the largest reforestation program in the world and has been operating since 1999. The GFGP has promoted the establishment of tree plantations over the preservation of diverse native forest. In a previous study (Hua et al. 2016, Nat Comms 7:12717), we showed that native forest supports higher species richnesses of birds and bees than do GFGP plantations. We also showed that  mixed-plantation GFGP plantations, which are mostly made up of two to five neighboring monoculture stands of different tree species, planted in checkboard fashion, support a level of bird (but not bee) species richness that is higher than any of the individual GFGP monocultures, although still below that of native forest. To better protect terrestrial biodiversity, which is an important objective of Chinas land-sustainability spending, we recommended that the GFGP should firstly prioritize native forest conservation and regeneration and secondly promote checkerboard planting arrangements over monocultures. Here, we use metabarcoding of arthropod biodiversity to test the generality of these results and policy recommendations.\\n\\nLocationSichuan, China\\n\\nMethodsWe used COI-amplicon sequencing ( metabarcoding) of bulk samples of arthropods that were collected with pan traps in native forest, cropland, mixed plantations, and monocultures.\\n\\nResultsNative forest supports the highest overall levels of arthropod species richness and diversity, followed by cropland and mixed plantations, followed by bamboo monoculture, followed by the other monocultures. Also, the arthropod community in mixed plantations shares more species with native forest than do any of the monocultures. Together, these results show a biodiversity value of mixed plantations for arthropods that is higher than that previously indicated by bees alone.\\n\\nMain conclusionThese results strengthen our original policy recommendations of (1) promoting the conservation and expansion of native forest and (2) promoting mixed-plantation arrangements. The value of this added metabarcoding-based analysis is that these policy prescriptions are now also based on a dataset that includes over 500 species-resolution taxa, ranging across the Arthropoda.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPsychotic symptoms are proposed lie on a continuum, ranging from isolated psychosis-like experiences (PLEs) in non-clinical populations to frank disorder. Here, we investigate neurobiological correlates of this symptomatologic continuum by examining whether functional connectivity of dorsal corticostriatal circuitry, which is disrupted in patients and high-risk individuals, is associated with the severity of subclinical PLEs.\\n\\nMethodsA community sample of 672 adults with no history of psychiatric or neurological illnesses completed a battery of seven questionnaires spanning various PLE domains. Principal component analysis (PCA) estimated major dimensions of PLEs from the questionnaires. PCA dimension scores were then correlated with whole-brain voxelwise functional connectivity (FC) maps of the striatum in a subset of 353 participants who completed a resting-state neuroimaging protocol.\\n\\nResultsPCA identified two dimensions of PLEs accounting for 62.57% of variance in the measures, corresponding to positive and negative PLEs. Reduced FC between the dorsal striatum and prefrontal cortex correlated with higher positive PLEs. Negative PLEs correlated with increased FC between the dorsal striatum and visual and sensorimotor areas. In the ventral corticostriatal system, positive and negative PLEs were both associated with FC between the ventro-rostral putamen and sensorimotor cortices.\\n\\nConclusionsConsistent with past findings in patients and high-risk individuals, subthreshold positive symptomatology is associated with reduced FC of the dorsal circuit. These findings suggest that the connectivity of this circuit tracks the expression of psychotic phenomena across a broad spectrum of severity, extending from the subclinical domain to clinical diagnosis.",
