    "abstract": "Posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been implicated in navigation, in the control of body movement, and in visually-guided decisions. Seeking to relate these views, we measured activity in populations of PPC neurons while mice performed a virtual navigation task driven by visual decisions. We found that PPC neurons are selective for specific combinations of the animals spatial position and heading angle. This selectivity closely predicted both the activity of individual PPC neurons, and the arrangement of their collective firing patterns in choice-selective sequences. These sequences reflected the influence on PPC of the animals navigation trajectory. An alternative model in which PPC activity encoded position and decision performed more poorly, and a model with all three variables barely outperformed the simple position-heading model. Alternative models based on visual or motor variables were inferior. We conclude that when mice use vision to choose their trajectories, a large fraction of parietal cortex activity can be predicted from simple attributes such as spatial position and heading.",

    "abstract": "During development, cells must coordinate their differentiation with their growth and organization to form complex multicellular structures such as tissues and organs. Healthy tissues must maintain these structures during homeostasis. Epithelia are packed ensembles of cells from which the different tissues of the organism will originate during embryogenesis. A large barrier to the analysis of the morphogenetic changes in epithelia is the lack of simple tools that enable the quantification of cell arrangements. Here we present EpiGraph, an image analysis tool that quantifies epithelial organization. Our method combines computational geometry and graph theory to measure the degree of order of any packed tissue. EpiGraph goes beyond the traditional polygon distribution analysis, capturing other organizational traits that improve the characterization of epithelia. EpiGraph can objectively compare the rearrangements of epithelial cells during development and homeostasis to quantify how the global ensemble is affected. Importantly, it has been implemented in the open-access platform FIJI. This makes EpiGraph very user friendly, with no programming skills required.",

    "abstract": "Flagella of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are nearly identical to cilia of mammalian cells and provide an excellent model to study ciliogenesis. These biflagellated cells have two actin genes: one encoding a conventional actin (IDA5) and the other encoding a divergent novel actin-like protein (NAP1). Previously, we described a role for actin in the regulation of flagella-building intraflagellar transport machinery. Here, we probe how actin redundancy contributes to this process using a nap1 mutant Chlamydomonas strain. Disruption of a single actin allows normal or slower incorporation but complete flagellar assembly. However, when we disrupt both actins using Latrunculin B (LatB) treatment on the nap1 mutant background, we find flagellar growth from newly synthesized limiting flagellar proteins is actin-dependent. Upon total actin disruption during flagellar assembly, transmission electron microscopy identified an accumulation of Golgi-adjacent vesicles, suggesting impaired vesicular trafficking may be the mechanism by which actin supports flagellar growth from new flagellar proteins. We also find there is a mislocalization of a key transition zone gating and ciliopathy protein, NPHP-4. Extended (2 hour) treatment with LatB, a condition under which NAP1 is upregulated, restores NPHP-4 localization. This suggests NAP1 can perform the functions of conventional actin at the transition zone. Our experiments demonstrate that each stage of flagellar biogenesis requires redundant actin function to varying degrees, with an absolute requirement for these actins in transport of Golgi-adjacent vesicles and flagellar incorporation of newly synthesized proteins.",

We tested whether ancient Earth conditions (low O2, high Fe2+, high Mn2+) can revert the ribosome to a functional ancestral state. First, SHAPE (Selective 2 Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension) was used to compare the effect of Mg2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ on the tertiary structure of rRNA. Then, we used in vitro translation reactions to test whether Fe2+ or Mn2+ could mediate protein production, and quantified ribosomal metal content. We found that: (i) Mg2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ had strikingly similar effects on rRNA folding; (ii) Fe2+ and Mn2+ can replace Mg2+ as the dominant divalent cation during translation of mRNA to functional protein; (iii) Fe and Mn associate extensively with the ribosome.

    "abstract": "MotivationChlP-seq is used extensively to identify sites of transcription factor binding or regions of epigenetic modifications to the genome. A key step in ChIP-seq analysis is peak calling, where genomic regions enriched for ChIP versus control reads are identified. Many programs have been designed to solve this task, but nearly all fall into the statistical trap of using the data twice--once to determine candidate enriched regions, and again to assess enrichment by classical statistical hypothesis testing. This double use of the data invalidates the statistical significance assigned to enriched regions, and as a consequence, invalidates false discovery rate estimates. Thus, the true significance or reliability of peak calls remains unknown.\\n\\nResultsUsing simulated and real ChIP-seq data sets, we show that three well-known peak callers, MACS, SICER and diffReps, output optimistically biased p-values, and therefore optimistic false discovery rate estimates--in some cases, many orders of magnitude too optimistic. We propose a wrapper algorithm, RECAP, that uses resampling of ChIP-seq and control data to estimate and correct for biases built into peak calling algorithms. P-values recalibrated by RECAP are approximately uniformly distributed when applied to null hypothesis data, in which ChIP-seq and control come from the same genomic distributions. When applied to non-null data, RECAP p-values give a better estimate of the true statistical significance of candidate peaks and better false discovery rate estimates, which correlate better with empirical reproducibility. RECAP is a powerful new tool for assessing the true statistical significance of ChIP-seq peak calls.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe RECAP software is available on github at https://github.com/theodorejperkins/RECAP.\\n\\nContacttperkins@ohri.ca",

    "abstract": "Long-term field studies coupled with quantitative genomics offer a powerful means to understand the genetic bases underlying quantitative traits and their evolutionary changes. However, analyzing and interpreting the time scales at which adaptive evolution occurs is challenging. First, while evolution is predictable in the short term, with strikingly rapid phenotypic changes in data series, it remains unpredictable in the long term. Second, while the temporal dynamics of some loci with large effect on phenotypic variation and fitness have been characterized, this task can be complicated in cases of highly polygenic trait architecture implicating numerous small effect size loci, or when statistical tests are sensitive to the heterogeneity of some key characteristics of the genome, like recombination rate variations. After introducing these aforementioned challenges, we discuss a recent investigation of the genomic architecture and spatio-temporal variation in great tit bill length, which was related to the recent use of bird feeders. We discuss how this case study illustrates the importance of considering different temporal scales and evolutionary mechanisms both while analyzing trait temporal trends and when searching for and interpreting the signals of putative genomic footprints of selection. More generally this commentary discusses interesting challenges for unraveling the time scale at which adaptive traits evolve and their genomic bases.\\n\\nImpact summaryAn important goal in evolutionary biology is to understand how individual traits evolve, leading to fascinating variations in time and space. Long-term field studies have been crucial in trying to understand the timing, extent, and ecological determinants of such trait variation in wild populations. In this context, recent genomic tools can be used to look for the genetic bases underlying such trait variation and can provide clues on the nature and timing of their evolution. However, the analysis and the interpretation of the time scales at which evolution occurs remain challenging. First, analyzing long-term data series can be tricky; short-term changes are highly predictable whereas long-term evolution is much less predictable. A second difficult task is to study the architecture of complex quantitative traits and to decipher the timing and roles of the several genomic mechanisms involved in their evolution. This commentary introduces these challenges and discusses a recent investigation of the nature and timing of ecological and genomic factors responsible for variation in great tit bill length. Overall, we raise cautionary warnings regarding several conceptual and technical features and limitations when coupling analyses of long-term and genomic data to study trait evolution in wild populations.",

    "abstract": "The neurobiological heterogeneity of schizophrenia is widely accepted, but it is unclear how mechanistic differences converge to produce the observed phenotype. Establishing a pathophysiological model that accounts for both heterogeneity and phenotypic similarity is essential to inform stratified treatment approaches. In this cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study, we recruited 77 healthy controls (HC), and 71 patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (SCZ), and reconstructed the structural connectivity of 90 brain regions covering entire cerebral cortex. We first confirmed the heterogeneity in structural connectivity by showing a reduced inter-individual similarity in SCZ compared with HC. Moreover, we found it was not possible to cluster patients into subgroups with shared patterns of dysconnectivity, indicating a high degree of mechanistic divergence in schizophrenia. Instead of the strength of connectivity between any particular brain regions, we investigated the diversity (or statistically, the variance) of the topographic distribution of the strength was reduced. HC had higher topographic diversity in whole brain structural connectivity compared to the patient group\\n\\n(P = 2 x 10-6, T = 4.96, Cohen'S d = 0.87). In 62 of the 90 brain regions, the topographic diversity was significantly reduced in patients compared to controls after FDR correction (<0.05). When topographic diversity was used as a discriminant feature for classification between patients and controls, we significantly (P = 4.29 x 10-24) improved the classification accuracy to 79.6% (sensitivity 78.3%, specificity 81.3%). This finding suggests highly individualized pattern of structural dysconnectivity underlying the heterogeneity of schizophrenia converges to a convergent common pathway as reduced topographic diversity for the clinical construct of the disease.",

Here we show that in vitro ZIKV infection of human cells, including NPCs, causes disruption of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. NMD is a cellular mRNA surveillance mechanism that is required for normal brain size in mice2-4. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry, we identified multiple cellular NMD factors that bind to the viral capsid protein, including the central NMD regulator up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1)5. Endogenous UPF1 interacted with the viral capsid protein in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and capsid expression post-transcriptionally downregulated UPF1, a process that we confirmed occurs during de novo ZIKV infection. A further decrease in UPF1 levels by RNAi significantly enhanced ZIKV infection in NPC cultures. We therefore propose that ZIKV, via the capsid protein, has evolved a strategy to dampen antiviral activities of NMD6,7, which subsequently contributes to neuropathology in vivo.",

Collagen synthesis is co-ordinated with the circadian clock, which curiously in cancer cells, is deregulated by ER stress. We hypothesised that interplay exists between circadian rhythm, collagen synthesis and ER stress in normal cells. Here we show that fibroblasts with ER stress do not demonstrate circadian rhythms in gene expression upon clock-synchronizing time cues. Conversely, overexpression of BiP or treatment with chemical chaperones strengthens the oscillation amplitude of circadian rhythms. The significance of these findings was explored in tendon, where we showed that BiP expression is ramped preemptively prior to a surge in collagen synthesis at night, thereby preventing protein misfolding and ER stress. In turn, we propose, this forestalls activation of the unfolded protein response in order for circadian rhythms to be maintained. Thus, targeting ER stress could be used to modulate circadian rhythm and restore collagen homeostasis in disease.",

    "abstract": "We applied simulation-based approaches to characterize how microbial community structure influences the amount of sequencing effort to reconstruct metagenomes that are assembled from short read sequences. An initial analysis evaluated the quantity, completion, and contamination of complete-metagenome-assembled genome (complete-MAG) equivalents, a bioinformatic-pipeline normalized metric for MAG quantity, as a function of sequencing effort, on four preexisting sequence read datasets taken from a maize soil, an estuarine sediment, the surface ocean, and the human gut. These datasets were subsampled to varying degrees of completeness in order to simulate the effect of sequencing effort on MAG retrieval. Modeling suggested that sequencing efforts beyond what is typical in published experiments (1 to 10 Gbp) would generate diminishing returns in terms of MAG binning. A second analysis explored the theoretical relationship between sequencing effort and the proportion of available metagenomic DNA sequenced during a sequencing experiment as a function of community richness, evenness, and genome size. Simulations from this analysis demonstrated that while community richness and evenness influenced the amount of sequencing required to sequence a community metagenome to exhaustion, the effort necessary to sequence an individual genome to a target fraction of exhaustion was only dependent on the relative abundance of the corresponding organism and its genome size. A software tool, GRASE, was created to assist investigators further explore this relationship. Re-evaluation of the relationship between sequencing effort and binning success in the context of the relative abundance of genomes, as opposed to base pairs, provides a framework to design sequencing experiments based on the relative abundance of microbes in an environment rather than arbitrary levels of sequencing effort.",

    "abstract": "Ecological flexibility, extended lifespans, and large brains, have long intrigued evolutionary biologists, and comparative genomics offers an efficient and effective tool for generating new insights into the evolution of such traits. Studies of capuchin monkeys are particularly well situated to shed light on the selective pressures and genetic underpinnings of local adaptation to diverse habitats, longevity, and brain development. Distributed widely across Central and South America, they are inventive and extractive foragers, known for their sensorimotor intelligence. Capuchins have the largest relative brain size of any monkey and a lifespan that exceeds 50 years, despite their small (3-5 kg) body size. We assemble a de novo reference genome for Cebus imitator and provide the first genome annotation of a capuchin monkey. Through high-depth sequencing of DNA derived from blood, various tissues and feces via fluorescence activated cell sorting (fecalFACS) to isolate monkey epithelial cells, we compared genomes of capuchin populations from tropical dry forests and lowland rainforests and identified population divergence in genes involved in water balance, kidney function, and metabolism. Through a comparative genomics approach spanning a wide diversity of mammals, we identified genes under positive selection associated with longevity and brain development. Additionally, we provide a technological advancement in the use of non-invasive genomics for studies of free-ranging mammals. Our intra- and interspecific comparative study of capuchin genomics provides new insights into processes underlying local adaptation to diverse and physiologically challenging environments, as well as the molecular basis of brain evolution and longevity.\n\nSIGNIFICANCESurviving challenging environments, living long lives, and engaging in complex cognitive processes are hallmark characteristics of human evolution. Similar traits have evolved in parallel in capuchin monkeys, but their genetic underpinnings remain unexplored. We developed and annotated a reference assembly for white-faced capuchin monkeys to explore the evolution of these phenotypes. By comparing populations of capuchins inhabiting rainforest versus dry forests with seasonal droughts, we detected selection in genes associated with kidney function, muscular wasting, and metabolism, suggesting adaptation to periodic resource scarcity. When comparing capuchins to other mammals, we identified evidence of selection in multiple genes implicated in longevity and brain development.

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in annotating the genome with experimental methods, much of the regulatory noncoding genome remains poorly defined. Here we assert that regulatory elements may be characterized by leveraging local epigenomic signatures at sites where specific transcription factors (TFs) are bound. To link these two identifying features, we introduce IMPACT, a genome annotation strategy which identifies regulatory elements defined by cell-state-specific TF binding profiles, learned from 515 chromatin and sequence annotations. We validate IMPACT using multiple compelling applications. First, IMPACT predicts TF motif binding with high accuracy (average AUC 0.92, s.e. 0.03; across 8 TFs), a significant improvement (all p<6.9e-15) over intersecting motifs with open chromatin (average AUC 0.66, s.e. 0.11). Second, an IMPACT annotation trained on RNA polymerase II is more enriched for peripheral blood cis-eQTL variation (N=3,754) than sequence based annotations, such as promoters and regions around the TSS, (permutation p<1e-3, 25% average increase in enrichment). Third, integration with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) summary statistics from European (N=38,242) and East Asian (N=22,515) populations revealed that the top 5% of CD4+ Treg IMPACT regulatory elements capture 85.7% (s.e. 19.4%) of RA h2 (p<1.6e-5) and that the top 9.8% of Treg IMPACT regulatory elements, consisting of all SNPs with a non-zero annotation value, capture 97.3% (s.e. 18.2%) of RA h2 (p<7.6e-7), the most comprehensive explanation for RA h2 to date. In comparison, the average RA h2 captured by compared CD4+ T histone marks is 42.3% and by CD4+ T specifically expressed gene sets is 36.4%. Finally, integration with RA fine-mapping data (N=27,345) revealed a significant enrichment (2.87, p<8.6e-3) of putatively causal variants across 20 RA associated loci in the top 1% of CD4+ Treg IMPACT regulatory regions. Overall, we find that IMPACT generalizes well to other cell types in identifying complex trait associated regulatory elements.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVisual pattern detection and discrimination are essential first steps for scene analysis. Numerous human psychophysical studies have modeled visual pattern detection and discrimination by estimating linear templates for classifying noisy stimuli defined by spatial variations in pixel intensities. However, such methods are poorly suited to understanding sensory processing mechanisms for complex visual stimuli such as second-order boundaries defined by spatial differences in contrast or texture.\\n\\nMethodology / Principal FindingsWe introduce a novel machine learning framework for modeling human perception of second-order visual stimuli, using image-computable hierarchical neural network models fit directly to psychophysical trial data. This framework is applied to modeling visual processing of boundaries defined by differences in the contrast of a carrier texture pattern, in two different psychophysical tasks: (1) boundary orientation identification, and (2) fine orientation discrimination. Cross-validation analysis is employed to optimize model hyper-parameters, and demonstrate that these models are able to accurately predict human performance on novel stimulus sets not used for fitting model parameters. We find that, like the ideal observer, human observers take a region-based approach to the orientation identification task, while taking an edge-based approach to the fine orientation discrimination task. How observers integrate contrast modulation across orientation channels is investigated by fitting psychophysical data with two models representing competing hypotheses, revealing a preference for a model which combines multiple orientations at the earliest possible stage. Our results suggest that this machine learning approach has much potential to advance the study of second-order visual processing, and we outline future steps towards generalizing the method to modeling visual segmentation of natural texture boundaries.\\n\\nConclusions / SignificanceThis study demonstrates how machine learning methodology can be fruitfully applied to psychophysical studies of second-order visual processing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe diversity and evolutionary success of beetles (Coleoptera) are proposed to be related to the diversity of plants on which they feed. Indeed the largest beetle suborder, Polyphaga, mostly includes plant-eaters among its ~315,000 species. In particular, plants defend themselves with a diversity of specialized toxic chemicals. These may impose selective pressures that drive genomic diversification and speciation in phytophagous beetles. However, evidence of changes in beetle gene repertoires driven by such interactions remains largely anecdotal and without explicit hypothesis testing.\\n\\nResultsTo address this, we explored the genomic consequences of beetle-plant trophic interactions by performing comparative gene family analyses across 18 species representing the two most species-rich beetle suborders. We contrasted the gene contents of species from the mostly plant-eating suborder Polyphaga with those of the mainly predatory Adephaga. We found gene repertoire evolution to be more dynamic, with significantly more adaptive lineage-specific expansions, in the more speciose Polyphaga. Testing the specific hypothesis of adaptation to plant-feeding, we identified families of enzymes putatively involved in beetle-plant interactions that underwent adaptive expansions in Polyphaga. There was especially strong support for the selection hypothesis on large gene families for glutathione S-transferase and carboxylesterase detoxification enzymes.\\n\\nConclusionsOur explicit modeling of the evolution of gene repertoires across 18 species identifies adaptive lineage-specific gene family expansions that accompany the dietary shift towards plants in beetles. These genomic signatures support the popular hypothesis of a key role for interactions with plant chemical defenses, and for plant-feeding in general, in driving beetle diversification.",

However, previously developed methods were limited by being difficulty to implement, time-consuming, or model-specific. Here, we propose an easy, efficient and general approach to estimating trial-wise changes in parameters: Leave-One-Trial-Out (LOTO). The rationale behind LOTO is that the difference between the parameter estimates for the complete dataset and for the dataset with one omitted trial reflects the parameter value in the omitted trial. We show that LOTO is superior to estimating parameter values from single trials and compare it to previously proposed approaches. Furthermore, the method allows distinguishing true variability in a parameter from noise and from variability in other parameters. In our view, the practicability and generality of LOTO will advance research on tracking fluctuations in latent cognitive variables and linking them to neural data.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an apicomplexan parasite with the ability to use foodborne, zoonotic, and congenital routes of transmission that causes severe disease in immunocompromised patients. The parasites harbor a lysosome-like digestive vacuole, termed the \\\"Vacuolar Compartment/Plant-Like Vacuole\\\" (VAC/PLV), which plays an important role in maintaining the lytic cycle and virulence of T. gondii. The VAC supplies proteolytic enzymes that are required to mature the parasites invasion effectors and that digest autophagosomes and endocytosed host proteins. Previous work identified a T. gondii ortholog of the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) that localized to the VAC. Here, we show that TgCRT is a membrane transporter that is functionally similar to PfCRT. We also genetically ablate TgCRT and reveal that TgCRT protein plays a key role in maintaining the integrity of the parasites endolysosomal system by controlling morphology of the VAC. When TgCRT is absent, the VAC dramatically increases in size by ~15-fold and co-localizes with its adjacent endosome-like compartment. Presumably to reduce aberrant swelling, transcription and translation of endolysosomal proteases are decreased in {Delta}TgCRT parasites. Expression of one endolysosomal subtilisin protease is quite significantly reduced, which impedes trimming of micronemal proteins, and significantly decreases parasite invasion. Chemical and genetic inhibition of proteolysis within the VAC reverses these effects, reducing VAC size and partially restoring the endolysosomal system, micronemal protein trimming, and invasion. Taken together, these findings reveal for the first time a physiological role of TgCRT in controlling VAC volume and the integrity of the endolysosomal system in T. gondii.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryToxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa and that infects virtually all warm-blooded organisms. Approximately one-third of the human population is infected with Toxoplasma. The parasites invade host cells via processed invasion effectors in order to disseminate infection. A lysosome-like digestive vacuole (VAC) is involved in refining these invasion effectors to reach their final forms. A T. gondii ortholog of the malarial chloroquine resistance transporter protein (TgCRT) was found to be localized to the VAC membrane. Although the mutated version of the malarial chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) has been shown to confer resistance to chloroquine treatment, its physiologic function remains poorly understood. Comparison between the related PfCRT and TgCRT proteins facilitates definition of the physiologic role of CRT proteins. In this study, we report that TgCRT plays a key role in regulating the integrity and proteolytic activity of the VAC and adjacent organelles, the secretion of invasion effectors, and parasite invasion and virulence. To relieve osmotic stress caused by VAC swelling when TgCRT is deleted, parasites repress proteolytic activities within this organelle to decrease solute accumulation, which then has secondary effects on parasite invasion. Our findings highlight a common function for PfCRT and TgCRT proteins in regulating apicomplexan parasite vacuolar size and function.",

Accurate estimation of mosquito migration is crucial for efforts to combat malaria. Modeling and cage experiments suggest that mosquito gene drive systems will enable malaria eradication, but establishing safety and efficacy requires identification of isolated populations in which to conduct field-testing. We assess Lake Victoria islands as candidate sites, finding one island 30 kilometers offshore is as differentiated from mainland samples as populations from across the continent.

Here we develop an optogenetic approach to specifically tune the binding half-life of a light-responsive ligand to a chimeric antigen receptor without changing other binding parameters. By simultaneously manipulating binding half-life while controlling for receptor occupancy, we find that signaling is strongly gated by ligand binding half-life.

    "abstract": "A longstanding prediction in evolutionary biology is that organisms experience a so-called \\\"cost of complexity\\\" manifested as a decreasing rate of adaptation in populations as organisms or selective environments become increasingly complex. This theory assumes the ubiquity of antagonistic pleiotropy, or tradeoffs in fitness, for mutations affecting multiple traits or phenotypes. A particular manifestation of antagonism thought to be at play in adaptive dynamics involves the relationship between viral growth rate and capsid stability, an interaction that may impede the adaptation of viral pathogens to novel hosts and environments. Here, we present a comparison of the genetics of adaptation for populations of bacteriophages undergoing complete adaptive walks under both simple and complex selective conditions, with complexity being determined by the number of traits under directional selection. We found no evidence for a long-term cost of complexity in viruses experiencing complex selection, with on average at least as great a rate of adaptation under more complex conditions, and rampant evidence for synergistic, rather than antagonistic, pleiotropy. The lack of evident tradeoffs between multiple phenotypes implies that emerging pathogens may be able to improve their growth in many different hosts or environments simultaneously and to do so at a faster rate than previously anticipated.",

    "abstract": "Diverse communities can adjust their trait composition to altered environmental conditions, which may strongly influence their dynamics. Previous studies of trait-based models mainly considered only one or two trophic levels, whereas most natural system are at least tritrophic. Therefore, we investigated how the addition of trait variation to each trophic level influences population and community dynamics in a tritrophic model. Examining the phase relationships between species of adjacent trophic levels informs about the degree of top-down or bottom-up control in non-steady-state situations. Phase relationships within a trophic level highlight compensatory dynamical patterns between functionally different species, which are responsible for dampening the community temporal variability. Furthermore, even without trait variation, our tritrophic model always exhibits regions with two alternative states with either weak or strong nutrient exploitation, and correspondingly low or high biomass production at the top level. However, adding trait variation increased the basin of attraction of the high-production state, and decreased the likelihood of a critical transition from the high-to the low-production state with no apparent early warning signals. Hence, our study shows that trait variation enhances resource use efficiency, production, variability, and resilience of entire food webs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAs costs of high throughput sequencing have fallen, we are seeing vast quantities of short read genomic data being generated. Often, the data is exchanged and stored as aligned reads, which provides high compression and convenient access for many analyses. However, aligned data becomes outdated as new reference genomes and alignment methods become available. Moreover, some applications cannot utilise pre-aligned reads at all, necessitating conversion back to raw format (FASTQ) before they can be used. In both cases, the process of extraction and realignment is expensive and time consuming.\\n\\nFindingsWe describe Bazam, a tool that efficiently extracts the original paired FASTQ from reads stored in aligned form (BAM or CRAM format). Bazam extracts reads in a format that directly allows realignment with popular aligners with high concurrency. Through eliminating steps and increasing the accessible concurrency, Bazam facilitates up to a 90% reduction in the time required for realignment compared to standard methods. Bazam can support selective extraction of read pairs from focused genomic regions, further increasing efficiency for targeted analyses. Bazam is additionally suitable as a base for other applications that require efficient paired read information, such as quality control, structural variant calling and alignment comparison.\\n\\nConclusionsBazam offers significant improvements for users needing to realign genomic data.",

    "abstract": "Visual performance depends on polar angle, even when eccentricity is held constant; on many psychophysical tasks observers perform best when stimuli are presented on the horizontal meridian, worst on the upper vertical, and intermediate on the lower vertical meridian. This variation in performance  around the visual field can be as pronounced as that of doubling the stimulus eccentricity. The causes of these asymmetries in performance are largely unknown. Some factors in the eye, e.g. cone density, are positively correlated with the reported variations in visual performance with polar angle. However, the question remains whether such correlations can quantitatively explain the perceptual differences observed  around the visual field. To investigate the extent to which the earliest stages of vision -optical quality and cone density- contribute to performance differences with polar angle, we created a computational observer model. The model uses the open-source software package ISETBIO to simulate an orientation discrimination task for which visual performance differs with polar angle. The model starts from the photons emitted by a display, which pass through simulated human optics with fixational eye movements, followed by cone isomerizations in the retina. Finally, we classify stimulus orientation using a support vector machine to learn a linear classifier on the photon absorptions. To account for the 30% increase in contrast thresholds for upper vertical compared to horizontal meridian, as observed psychophysically on the same task, our computational observer model would require either an increase of ~7 diopters of defocus or a reduction of 500% in cone density. These values far exceed the actual variations as a function of polar angle observed in human eyes. Therefore, we conclude that these factors in the eye only account for a small fraction of differences in visual performance with polar angle. Substantial additional asymmetries must arise in later retinal and/or cortical processing.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA fundamental goal in computational neuroscience is to link known facts from biology with behavior. Here, we considered visual behavior, specifically the fact that people are better at visual tasks performed to the left or right of the center of gaze, compared to above or below at the same distance from gaze. We sought to understand what aspects of biology govern this fundamental pattern in visual behavior. To do so, we implemented a computational observer model that incorporates known facts about the front end of the human visual system, including optics, eye movements, and the photoreceptor array in the retina. We found that even though some of these properties are correlated with performance, they fall far short of quantitatively explaining it. We conclude that later stages of processing in the nervous system greatly amplify small differences in the way the eye samples the visual world, resulting in strikingly different performance around the visual field.",

    "abstract": "TRPV5 (transient receptor potential vanilloid) is a unique calcium-selective TRP channel that is essential for calcium homeostasis. TRPV5 and its close homologue TRPV6 do not exhibit thermosensitivity or ligand-dependent activation, unlike other TRPV channels, but are constitutively opened at physiological membrane potentials. Here, we report high resolution electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of truncated and full length TRPV5 in lipid nanodisc, as well as a TRPV5 W583A mutant structure and a complex structure of TRPV5 with calmodulin (CaM). These structures highlight and explain functional differences between the thermosensitive and calcium-selective TRPV channels. An extended S1-S2 linker folds on top of the channel that might shield it from modulation by extracellular factors. Resident lipid densities in the homologous vanilloid pocket are different from those previously found in TRPV1, supporting a comparatively more rigid architecture of TRPV5. A ring of tryptophan residues (W583) at the bottom of the pore coordinates a density and mutation of W583 resultes in opening of the lower gate. Moreover, we provide structural insight into the calcium-dependent channel inactivation and propose a flexible stoichiometry for TRPV5 and CaM binding.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe program of embryonic development is launched by selective activation of a silent maternal transcriptome. In Caenorhabditis elegans, nuclei of the adult germline are responsible for the synthesis of at least two distinct mRNA populations; those required for housekeeping functions, and those that program the oocyte-to-embryo transition. We mapped this separation by changes to the length-distribution of poly(A)-tails that depend on GLD-2 mediated cytoplasmic polyadenylation and its regulators genome-wide.\\n\\nRESULTSMore than 1000 targets of cytoplasmic polyadenylation were identified by differential polyadenylation. Amongst mRNA with the greatest dependence on GLD-2 were those encoding RNA binding proteins with known roles in spatiotemporal patterning such as mex-5 and pos-1. In General, the 3 UTR of GLD-2 targets were longer, contained cytosine-patches, and were enriched for non-standard polyadenylation-motifs. To identify the deadenylase that initiated transcript silencing, we depleted the known deadenylases in the gld-2(0) mutant background. Only the loss of CCF-1 suppressed the short-tailed phenotype of GLD-2 targets suggesting that in addition to its general role in RNA turnover, this is the major deadenylase for regulatory silencing of maternal mRNA. Analysis of poly(A)-tail length-change in the embryo lacking specific RNA-binding proteins revealed new candidates for asymmetric expression in the first embryonic divisions.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONThe concerted action of RNA binding proteins exquisitely regulates GLD-2 activity in space and time. We present our data as interactive web resources for a model where GLD-2 mediated cytoplasmic polyadenylation regulates target mRNA at each stage of worm germline and early embryonic development.",

    "abstract": "Although three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence microscopy is an essential tool for life science research, the fundamentally-limited optical throughput, as reflected in the compromise between speed and resolution, so far prevents further movement towards faster, clearer, and higher-throughput applications. We herein report a dual-stage mutual-feedback deep-learning approach that allows gradual reversion of microscopy degradation from high-resolution targets to low-resolution images. Using a single blurred-and-pixelated 3D image as input, our trained network infers a 3D output with notably higher resolution and improved contrast. The performance is better than conventional 1-stage network approaches. It pushes the throughput limit of current 3D fluorescence microscopy in three ways: notably reducing the acquisition time for accurate mapping of large organs, breaking the diffraction limit for imaging subcellular events with faster lower-toxicity measurement, and improving temporal resolution for capturing instantaneous biological processes. Combining our network approach with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate the imaging of vessels and neurons in the mouse brain at single-cell resolution and with a throughput of 6 minutes for a whole brain. We also image cell organelles beyond the diffraction limit at a 2-Hz volume rate, and map neuronal activities of freely-moving C. elegans at single-cell resolution and 30-Hz volume rate.",

    "abstract": "Transcription regulator on-off binding to DNA constitutes a mechanistic paradigm in gene regulation, in which the repressors/activators bind to operator sites tightly while the corresponding non-repressors/non-activators do not. Another paradigm regards regulator unbinding from DNA to be a unimolecular process whose kinetics is independent of regulator concentration. Using single-molecule single-cell measurements, we find that the behaviors of the zinc-responsive uptake regulator Zur challenges these paradigms. Apo-Zur, a non-repressor and presumed non-DNA binder, can bind to chromosome tightly in live E. coli cells, likely at non-consensus sequence sites. Moreover, the unbinding from DNA of its apo-non-repressor and holo-repressor forms both show a biphasic, repressed-followed-by-facilitated kinetics with increasing cellular protein concentrations. The facilitated unbinding likely occurs via a ternary complex formation mechanism; the repressed unbinding is first-of-its-kind and likely results from protein oligomerization on chromosome, in which an inter-protein salt-bridge plays a key role. This biphasic unbinding could provide functional advantages in Zur's facile switching between repression and derepression.",

How CBC exerts these effects is poorly defined and there is little information about its efficacy at cannabinoid receptors. We sought to determine the functional activity of CBC at CB1 and CB2 receptors.\\n\\nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACHAtT20 cells stably expressing HA-tagged human CB1 and CB2 receptors were used. Assays of cellular membrane potential and loss of cell surface receptors were performed.\\n\\nKEY RESULTSCBC activated CB2 but not CB1 receptors to produce a hyperpolarization of AtT20 cells. Activation of CB2 receptors was antagonised by the CB2 antagonist AM630 and sensitive to pertussis toxin. Co-application of CBC reduced activation of CB2 receptors CP55,940, a potent CB1 and CB2 agonist. Continuous CBC application induced loss of cell surface CB2 receptors and desensitisation of the CB2-induced hyperpolarization.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONSCannabichromene is a selective CB2 receptor agonist displaying higher efficacy than THC in hyperpolarising AtT20 cells.

    "abstract": "Floret fertility is a key trait to determine the number of grains per inflorescence in cereals. During wheat (Triticum sp.) evolution, floret fertility has been increased and current bread wheat (T. aestivum L.) produces three to five grains per spikelet; however, little is known about the genetic basis controlling floret fertility. Here we identify the quantitative trait locus Grain Number Increase 1 (GNI1), encoding a homeodomain leucine zipper class I (HD-Zip I) transcription factor. GNI1 evolved in the Triticeae through gene duplication and functionalization. GNI1 was predominantly expressed in the most apical floret primordia and parts of the rachilla, suggesting that GNI1 inhibits rachilla growth and development. GNI1 expression decreased during wheat evolution, and as a consequence, more fertile florets and grains per spikelet are being produced. Genetic analysis revealed that the reduced-function allele of GNI1-A contributes to increase the number of fertile florets per spikelet. The knockdown of GNI1 in transgenic hexaploid wheat improved fertile floret and grain number. Furthermore, wheat plants carrying the impaired allele increased grain yield under field conditions. Our findings illuminate that gene duplication and functionalization generated evolutionary novelty for floret fertility (i.e. reducing floral numbers) while the mutations towards increased grain production were under selection during wheat evolution under domestication.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGrain number is a fundamental trait for cereal grain yield; but its underlying genetic basis is mainly unknown in wheat. Here we show for the first time a direct link between increased floret fertility, higher grain number per spike and higher plot-yields of wheat in the field. We have identified GNI1 gene encoding an HD-Zip I transcription factor responsible for increased floret fertility. The wild type allele imposes an inhibitory role specifically during rachilla development, indicating that expression of this protein actively shuts-down grain yield potential; whereas, the reduced-function allele enables more florets and grains to be produced. GNI1 evolved through gene duplication in Triticeae and its mutations were under parallel human selection during wheat and barley evolution under domestication.",

In this context plant root-associated fungi appear as a new strategy to improve ecophysiological performance and yield of crops under abiotic stress. Here, we evaluated how the inoculation of fungal endophytes isolated from Antarctic plants can improve the ecophysiological performance in cultivars of tomato and lettuce, grown under different salt conditions. In addition, we assessed if the expression of the NHX1 gene that is related with salt tolerance is enhanced in presence of fungal endophytes. Finally, we evaluated the regulation the nutritional status and specifically the Na+ content in leaves. Overall, those individuals with presence of endophytes showed higher ecophysiological performance. In addition, the presence of fungal endophytes was correlated with a higher regulation of ion homeostasis by enhanced expression of NHX1 gene.

    "abstract": "Letrozole, a third-generation aromatase inhibitor, prevents the production of estrogens in the final step in conversion from androgens. Due to its efficacy at suppressing estrogens, letrozole has recently taken favor as a first-line adjuvant treatment for hormone-responsive breast cancer in middle-aged women. Though patient response to letrozole has generally been positive, there is conflicting evidence surrounding its impact on the development of depression. It is possible that letrozoles potential adverse effects on mood are a result of the impact of hormonal fluctuations on neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Thus, to clarify the effects of letrozole on the hippocampus and behavior, we examined how chronic administration affects hippocampal neurogenesis and depressive-like behaviour in middle-aged, intact female mice. Mice were given either letrozole (1mg/kg) or vehicle by injection (ip) daily for 3 weeks. Depressive-like behaviour was assessed during the last 3 days of treatment using the forced swim test, tail suspension test, and sucrose preference test, and the production of new neurons was quantified using the immature neuronal marker, doublecortin (DCX). We found that letrozole increased DCX expression and maturation in the dentate gyrus, but had no significant effect on depressive-like behaviour. Our findings suggest that a reduction in circulating estrogens in middle-aged females increases hippocampal neurogenesis without any adverse impact on behavior; as such, this furthers our understanding of how estrogens modulate neurogenesis, and to the rationale for the utilization of letrozole in the clinical management of breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "At high doses, the current recommended radiation weighting factors advise a significantly higher effectiveness of alpha particles relative to gamma radiation. However, at lower doses, the ratio of effectiveness between radiations of varying linear energy transfer values is complicated due to the relative importance of low dose phenomena such as genomic instability, bystander effects, low dose hyper-radiosensitivity and increased radioresistance (HRS/IRR). Radium is the most common source of alpha radiation exposure to humans, but the dosimetry is complicated by the decay chain which involves gamma exposure due to radon daughters. This study aimed to isolate the relative biological effect of alpha particles after low doses of radium to cells and their progeny. This was done by subtracting the survival values of a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) and an embryonic Chinook salmon cell line (CHSE-214) exposed to gamma irradiation, from survival of the same cell lines exposed to mixed alpha and gamma radiation through chronic exposure to Ra-226 and its decay products. The human cell line showed increased radioresistance when exposed to low doses of alpha particles. In contrast the fish cell line, which demonstrated radioresistance to low dose gamma energy, demonstrated increased lethality when exposed to low doses of alpha particles. The results confirm the need to consider the dose-response relationship when developing radiation weighting factors for low dose exposures, as well as the need to be aware of possible cell line and species differences.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy has become an indispensable tool for structural studies of biological macromolecules. There are two predominant methods for studying the architectures of multi-protein complexes: (1) single particle analysis of purified samples and (2) tomography of whole cells or cell sections. The former can produce high-resolution structures but is limited to highly purified samples, while the latter can capture proteins in their native state but is hindered by a low signal-to-noise ratio and results in lower-resolution structures. Here, we present a method combining microfluidic single cell extraction with single particle analysis by electron microscopy to characterize protein complexes from individual C. elegans embryos. Using this approach, we uncover three-dimensional structures of ribosomes directly from single embryo extracts. In addition, we investigate structural dynamics during development by counting the number of ribosomes per polysome in early and late embyros. This approach has significant potential applications for counting protein complexes and studying protein architectures from single cells in developmental, evolutionary and disease contexts.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAmebiasis is a major health problem caused by the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica with a worldwide distribution, especially in developing countries. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the proportion prevalence of E. histolytica/dispar in human in Iraq.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsPublished studies on human infection with E. histolytica/dispar in Iraq were searched in electronic databases using Google scholar, Iraqi Academic Scientific Journals (IASJ), PubMed, ScienceDirect and WHO Global Health Library (GHL). Eligible studies were cross-sectional and used fecal and/or serological methods to diagnose E. histolytica/dispar infection in human in Iraq, and published between 1970 and July 2017. The pooled prevalence was calculated using random effect model meta-analyses with 95% confidence interval (CI). Ninety nine studies were eligible for the meta-analysis that included 117694 individuals. The pooled proportion for E. histolytica/dispar infection in Iraq was estimated at 20.61% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 17.83, 23.53. A high level of heterogeneity was found among the studies. The prevalence among Iraqi population ranged between 1.66 and 90.5% per study (mean: 22.36%). The pooled prevalence of infection was 58.43% (95% CI: 54.71%?62.1%) and 43.10% (95% CI: 39.66%-46.6%) for males and females respectively. Parasite screening using microscopy did not differentiate between the pathogenic and nonpathogenic species of Entamoeba resulted in higher proportion prevalence than PCR proportion prevalence, (20.32%, 95% CI: 17.80%-22.96%) (17.57%, 95% CI: 8.07%-29.75%) respectively. Hospital based studies recorded the highest prevalence of E. histolytica/dispar infection at 22.69% (95% CI: 19.55%-25.99%). The prevalence decreased into 18.46 (95% CI: 14.28%-23.04%) between 2010 and 2017.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceAlthough there was a reduction in prevalence of amebiasis since 2010, the prevalence of amebiasis is still considerable in population of Iraq. Therefore, prevention strategies of fecal contamination are required to reduce the infection.\n\nAuthor summaryAmebiasis is the infection with Entamoeba histolytica an invasive parasite dwelling the intestine or other organs such as liver, lungs, or skin of human. Infection with this parasite could be acquired by consumption of contaminated water, vegetables, and fruits with feces of infected human. The infection may be asymptomatic or symptomatic causing dysentery. We performed this meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of amebiasis in the population of Iraq between 1970 and 2017. Ninety nine published studies were identified and the data were extracted from them to use in our meta-analysis and the total included individuals were 117694. The prevalence of population infection in Iraq was evaluated at 20.61%. The infection prevalence was higher in males than in females. The infection prevalence decreased during the period 2010 to 2017 in Iraqi population. This level of infection needs further efforts to eradicate amebiasis, these efforts begin with the prevention of the disease transmission through water and food and treatment of infected people. So awareness of simple hygienic principles can control the disease by boiling water and washing vegetables and fruits thoroughly.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal microbiota influence diverse aspects of host physiology, including the development and function of myeloid lineages. Numerous host and microbial factors are known to poise neutrophils and other granulocytes for response to pathogens and danger signals, yet the mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota regulate this process are largely unknown. Using gnotobiotic zebrafish, we identified the immune effector Serum amyloid A (Saa) as one of the most highly induced transcripts in digestive tissues following microbiota colonization. Saa is a conserved secreted protein produced in the intestine and liver with described effects on neutrophils in vitro, however its in vivo functions are poorly defined. We engineered saa mutant zebrafish to test requirements for Saa on innate immunity in vivo. Zebrafish mutant for saa displayed impaired neutrophil responses to wounding but augmented clearance of pathogenic bacteria. At baseline, saa mutants exhibited moderate neutrophilia and altered neutrophil tissue distribution. Molecular and functional analyses of isolated neutrophils revealed that Saa suppresses expression of pro-inflammatory mRNAs and bactericidal activity. Saas effects on neutrophils depends on microbiota colonization, suggesting this protein mediates the microbiotas influence on host innate immunity. To test tissue-specific roles of Saa on neutrophil function, we generated transgenic zebrafish over-expressing saa in the intestine. Transgenic intestinal saa expression was sufficient to partially complement the neutrophil phenotypes in saa mutants. These results indicate Saa produced by the intestine in response to microbiota serves as a systemic signal to neutrophils to restrict aberrant activation, decreasing inflammatory tone and bacterial killing potential while simultaneously enhancing their ability to migrate to wounds.",

    "abstract": "Regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins primarily function as GTPase-accelerating proteins (GAPs) to promote GTP hydrolysis of G subunits, thereby regulating G-protein mediated signaling. RGS proteins could also contain additional domains such as GoLoco to inhibit GDP dissociation. The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae encodes eight RGS and RGS-like proteins (MoRgs1 to MoRgs8) that have shared and distinct functions in growth, appressorium formation and pathogenicity. Interestingly, MoRgs7 and MoRgs8 contain a C-terminal seven-transmembrane domain (7-TM) motif typical of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) proteins, in addition to the conserved RGS domain. We found that MoRgs7, together with G MoMagA but not MoRgs8, undergoes endocytic transport from the plasma membrane to the endosome upon sensing of surface hydrophobicity. We also found that MoRgs7 can interact with hydrophobic surfaces via a hydrophobic interaction, leading to the perception of environmental hydrophobic cues. Moreover, we found that MoRgs7-MoMagA endocytosis is regulated by actin patch-associated protein MoCrn1, linking it to cAMP signaling. Our studies provided evidence suggesting that MoRgs7 could also function in a GPCR-like manner to sense environmental signals and it, together with additional proteins of diverse functions, promotes cAMP signaling required for developmental processes underlying appressorium function and pathogenicity.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe 7-TM domain is considered the hallmark of GPCR proteins, which activate G proteins upon ligand binding and undergo endocytosis for regeneration or recycling. Among eight RGS and RGS-like proteins of M. oryzae, MoRgs7 and MoRgs8 contain the 7-TM domain in addition to the RGS domain. We found that MoRgs7 can form hydrophobic interactions with the hydrophobic surface. This interaction is important in sensing hydrophobic cues by the fungus. We also found that, in response to surface hydrophobicity, MoRgs7 couples with G subunit MoMagA to undergo endocytosis leading to the activation of cAMP signaling. Moreover, we found that such an endocytic event requires functions of the actin-binding protein MoCrn1. Our results revealed MoRgs7 functions as a GPCR-like receptor protein to sense surface cues and activate signaling required for pathogenesis, providing new insights into G-protein regulatory mechanisms in this and other pathogenic fungi.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent in nature, meaning that they have the capacity to differentiate into any cell in the body. However, to do so they must transition through a series of intermediate cell states before becoming terminally differentiated. A lot is known about how ESCs maintain their pluripotent state but comparatively less about how they exit this state and begin the transition towards differentiated cells. Here we investigated the earliest events in this transition by determining the changes in the open chromatin landscape as naive mouse ESCs transition to epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs). Motif enrichment analysis of the newly opening regions coupled with expression analysis identified ZIC3 as a potential regulator of this cell fate transition. Chromatin binding and genome-wide transcriptional profiling confirmed ZIC3 as an important regulatory transcription factor and among its targets are genes encoding a number of transcription factors. Among these is GRHL2 which acts through enhancer switching to maintain the expression of a subset of genes from the ESC state. Our data therefore place ZIC3 at the top of a cascade of transcriptional regulators and provide an important advance in our understanding of the regulatory factors governing the earliest steps in ESC differentiation.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThe transcription factor ZIC3 drives gene expression changes in the ESC to EpiLC transition.\\nC_LIO_LIExtensive changes occur in the open chromatin landscape as ESCs progress to EpiLCs.\\nC_LIO_LIZIC3 activates the expression of a network of transcription factors.\\nC_LIO_LIZIC3 activated genes in EpiLCs are upregulated in the post-implantation epiblast.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic mosquito-borne flavivirus of global importance. Neuroinvasive WNV infection results in encephalitis and can lead to prolonged neurological impairment or death. Type I interferon (IFN-I) is crucial for promoting antiviral defenses through the induction of antiviral effectors, which function to restrict viral replication and spread. However, our understanding of the antiviral response to WNV infection is mostly derived from analysis of bulk cell populations. It is becoming increasingly apparent that substantial heterogeneity in cellular processes exists among individual cells, even within a seemingly homogenous cell population. Here, we present WNV-inclusive single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), an approach to examine the transcriptional variation and viral RNA burden across single cells. We observed that only a few cells within the bulk population displayed robust transcription of IFN-{beta} mRNA, and this did not appear to depend on viral RNA abundance within the same cell. Furthermore, we observed considerable transcriptional heterogeneity in the IFN-I response, with genes displaying high unimodal and bimodal expression patterns. Broadly, IFN-stimulated genes negatively correlated with viral RNA abundance, corresponding with a precipitous decline in expression in cells with high viral RNA levels. Altogether, we demonstrated the feasibility and utility of WNV-inclusive scRNA-seq as a high-throughput technique for single-cell transcriptomics and WNV RNA detection. This approach can be implemented in other models to provide insights into the cellular features of protective immunity and identify novel therapeutic targets.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEWest Nile virus (WNV) is a clinically relevant pathogen responsible for recurrent epidemics of neuroinvasive disease. Type I interferon is essential for promoting an antiviral response against WNV infection; however, it is unclear how heterogeneity in the antiviral response at the single-cell level impacts viral control. Specifically, conventional approaches lack the ability to distinguish differences across cells with varying viral abundance. The significance of our research is to demonstrate a new technique for studying WNV infection at the single-cell level. We discovered extensive variation in antiviral gene expression and viral abundance across cells. This protocol can be applied to primary cells or in vivo models to better understand the underlying cellular heterogeneity following WNV infection for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.",

Although it has been shown that balancing acts of the two HEAT-repeat subunits enable this complex to support dynamic assembly of chromosomal axes in vertebrate cells, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report the crystal structure of a human condensin I subcomplex comprising hCAP-G and hCAP-H. hCAP-H binds to the concave surfaces of a harp-shaped HEAT repeat domain of hCAP-G. A physical interaction between hCAP-G and hCAP-H is indeed essential for mitotic chromosome assembly recapitulated in Xenopus egg cell-free extracts. Furthermore, this study reveals that the human CAP-G-H subcomplex has the ability to interact with not only a double-stranded DNA, but also a single-stranded DNA, implicating potential, functional divergence of the vertebrate condensin I complex in mitotic chromosome assembly.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionMinor frequency viruses play many important roles during viral infection that cannot be explained by the consensus sequence alone. In influenza, immunosuppressed individuals appear to generate numerous viral variants, leading to subpopulations with important role in infection. The objective of the present study was to describe viral diversification over time in immunocompetent patients during influenza virus infection.\\n\\nMethodsAll clinical records of patients admitted to the Lyon university hospital (Lyon, France) during the influenza infection epidemics of the 2010-2015 period and sampled at least twice during their clinical management were retrospectively analyzed. To estimate performance of the sequencing procedures, well-characterized plasmids containing each of the 8 segments of influenza viruses were used as quality controls. Diversity, i.e. the number of validated single nucleotide variants, was analyzed to compare characteristics over time and according to clinical severity (mild, severe with neurological complications, severe with respiratory complications).\\n\\nResultsAfter validation on quality controls (n=51), and verification of possible confusion bias, a 5%-threshold of detection was applied to clinical viral sequences (n=29). At this threshold, amino-acid coordinates (n=183/4,246, 4.31%) were identified as having at least one mutation during clinical course, independently of the clinical severity. Considering a threshold of 4 days of symptoms, as a limit for early and late sampling, diversity was significantly higher in late samples for the mild group, compared to both early mild and severe groups (p<0.05). At a single-segment scale, for PB2-coding segment, diversity was significantly higher in early samples of the neurological group than in both early and late samples in the respiratory group and for late samples in the mild group (p<0.05). For the NS1-coding segment, significant differences were observed between initial diversity of mild and severe patients, as for early and late samples in mild patients (p<0.01). Discussion. This study is the first describing diversity through time, associating biological and clinical information during viral diversification, during the infection of an immunocompetent human host. This latter opens a large field of investigation in infectious disease management using next-generation sequencing and suggest development of new therapies, focusing on non-antigenic viral properties, in non-vaccine fields of research",

    "abstract": "To evade mammalian immunity, Trypanosoma brucei switches the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) expressed on its surface. Key to this reaction are controls exerted to ensure only one of many subtelomeric multigene VSG expression sites are transcribed at a time. DNA repair activities have to date been implicated only in catalysis of VSG switching by recombination, not transcriptional control. However, how VSG switching is signalled to guide the appropriate reaction, or to integrate switching into parasite growth, is unknown. Here we show that loss of ATR, a DNA damage signalling protein kinase, is lethal and causes increased nuclear genome lesions. ATR depletion also causes expression of mixed VSGs on the cell surface, increased transcription of genes from silent expression sites, and altered localisation of RNA Polymerase I and VEX1, factors involved in VSG transcription. The work therefore reveals that VSG expression control is mediated by a nuclear DNA damage signalling factor.",

    "abstract": "Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are a heterogeneous group of cells, comprised of numerous subpopulations, that work together to send visual information to the brain. In numerous blinding disorders termed optic neuropathies, RGCs are the main cell type affected leading to degeneration of these cells and eventual loss of vision. Previous studies have identified and characterized RGC subtypes in numerous animal systems, with only a handful of studies demonstrating their differential loss in response to disease and injury. Thus, efforts of the current study utilized an optic nerve crush (ONC) model to characterize the loss of RGCs and disease phenotypes associated with this injury. Additionally, the loss of RGC subtypes including direction selective-, alpha-, and ip-RGCs following ONC was explored. Results of this study demonstrated the differential loss of RGC subtypes with a high susceptibility for loss of alpha- and direction selective-RGCs and the preferential survival of ip-RGCs following ONC and allows for the establishment of additional studies focused on mechanisms and loss of these cells in optic neuropathies. Additionally, these results put important emphasis on the development of therapeutics targeted at the loss of specific subtypes as well as cellular replacement following injury and disease.",

    "abstract": "The threat of insecticide resistance across sub-Saharan Africa is anticipated to severely impact the continued effectiveness of malaria vector control. We investigated the effect of carbamate and pyrethroid resistance on Anopheles gambiae s.l age, Plasmodium falciparum infection and characterized molecular resistance mechanisms in Guinea. Pyrethroid resistance was intense, with survivors of ten times the insecticidal concentration required to kill susceptible individuals. The L1014F kdr allele was significantly associated with mosquito survival following deltamethrin or permethrin treatment (p=0.003 and p=0.04, respectively). N1575Y and I1527T mutations were identified in 13% and 10% of individuals, respectively, but neither conferred increased pyrethroid tolerance. Partial restoration of pyrethroid susceptibility following synergist pre-exposure suggest a role for mixed-function oxidases. Carbamate resistance was lower and significantly associated with the G119S Ace-1 mutation (p=0.001). Oocyst rates were 6.8% and 4.2% among resistant and susceptible mosquitoes, respectively; survivors of bendiocarb exposure were significantly more likely to be infected (p=0.03). Resistant mosquitoes had significantly lower parity rates; however, a subset of intensely pyrethroid-resistant vectors were more likely to be parous (p=0.042 and p=0.045, for survivors of five and ten times the diagnostic dose of insecticides, respectively). Our findings emphasize the need for additional studies directly assessing the influence of insecticide resistance on mosquito fitness.",

    "abstract": "It is nowadays clear that the single base substitutions that occur in the human genome, of which some lead to pathogenic conditions, are non-random and influenced by their flanking nucleobase sequences. However, despite recent progress, the understanding of these \\\"non-local\\\" effects is still far from being achieved. In order to advance this problem, we analyzed the relationship between the base mutability in gene regions and the electron hole transport along the DNA base stacks, as it is one of the mechanisms that have been suggested to contribute to these effects. More precisely, we studied the connection between the observed frequency of single base substitutions and the vertical ionization potential of the base and its flanking sequence, estimated using MP2/6-31G* ab initio quantum chemistry calculations. We found a good correlation between the two quantities, whose sign depend on whether SBS is in an exon, an intron or an untranslated region. Interestingly, the correlation appears to be higher for synonymous than for missense mutations, and when considering the flanking sequence of the substituted base in the 3 rather than in the 5 direction. A weaker but still statistically significant correlation it found between the ionization potentials and the pathogenicity of the base substitutions. Moreover, pathogenicity is also preferentially associated with larger changes in ionization potentials upon base substitution. With this analysis we gained new insights into the complex biophysical mechanisms that are at the basis of mutagenesis and pathogenicity, and supported the role of electron-hole transport in these matters.",

Conserved anatomical structures and functions of these nuclei have now been documented among fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, and these brain regions have come to be known as the vertebrate social behavior network (SBN). While it is known that nuclei (nodes) of the SBN are rich in steroid and neuropeptide activity linked to behavior, simultaneous variation in the expression of neuroendocrine genes among several SBN nuclei has not yet been described in detail. In this study, we use RNA-seq to profile gene expression across seven brain regions representing five nodes of the vertebrate SBN in a passerine bird, the wire-tailed manakin Pipra filicauda. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we reconstructed sets of coregulated genes, revealing striking patterns of variation in neuroendocrine gene expression across the SBN. We describe regional expression variation networks comprising a broad set of hormone receptors, neuropeptides, steroidogenic enzymes, catecholamines, and other neuroendocrine signaling molecules. Our findings highlight how heterogeneity of brain gene expression across the SBN can provide functional insights into the neuroendocrine and genetic mechanisms that underlie vertebrate social behavior.",

    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious disorder for which there is no approved pharmaceutical treatment. Following injury, native nephrons display limited regenerative capabilities, relying on the dedifferentiation and proliferation of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) that survive the insult. Previously, we identified 4-(phenylthio)butanoic acid (PTBA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) that enhances renal recovery and showed that PTBA treatment increased RTEC proliferation and reduced renal fibrosis. Here, we investigated the regenerative mechanisms of PTBA in zebrafish models of larval renal injury and adult cardiac injury. With respect to renal injury, we showed that delivery of PTBA using an esterified prodrug (UPHD25) increases the reactivation of the renal progenitor gene Pax2a, enhances dedifferentiation of RTECs, reduces Kidney injury molecule-1 expression, and lowers the number of infiltrating macrophages. Further, we find that the effects of PTBA on RTEC proliferation depend upon retinoic acid signaling and demonstrate the therapeutic properties of PTBA are not restricted to the kidney but also increase cardiomyocyte proliferation and decrease fibrosis following cardiac injury in adult zebrafish. These studies provide key mechanistic insights into how PTBA enhances tissue repair in models of acute injury and lay the groundwork for translating this novel HDI into the clinic.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTMortality associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) is in part due to limited treatments available to ameliorate kidney injury.

Huxley and his collaborators in 1981, which provides that the half-sarcomere compliance is due to the contribution of the compliances of the thin and thick filaments and actin-attached myosin motors, predicts that at any sarcomere length the absence of attached motors results in an infinite half-sarcomere compliance, in contrast with the observations. Growing evidence for the presence of a titin-like I-band spring urges the 1981 model to be implemented to include the contribution of this element in the mechanical model of the half-sarcomere.

    "abstract": "Many conserved protein-coding core genes are single copy and evolve faster, and thus are more resolving phylogenetic markers than the standard SSU rRNA gene but their use has been precluded by the lack of universal primers. Recent advances in gene targeted assembly methods for large shotgun metagenomes make their use feasible. To evaluate this approach, we compared the variation of two single copy ribosomal protein genes, rplB and rpsC, with the SSU rRNA gene for all completed bacterial genomes in NCBI RefSeq. As expected, among pairwise comparisons of all species that belong to the same genus, 94.9% and 91.0% of the pairs of rplB and rpsC, respectively, showed more variation than did their SSU rRNA gene sequences. We used a gene-targeted assembler, Xander, to assemble rplB and rpsC from shotgun metagenomic data from rhizosphere samples of three crops: corn (annual), and Miscanthus and switchgrass (both perennials). Both protein-coding genes separated all three communities whereas the SSU rRNA gene could only separate the annual from the two perennial communities in ordination analyses. Furthermore, assembled rplB and rpsC yielded significantly higher numbers of OTUs (alpha diversity) than the SSU rRNA gene. These results confirm these faster evolving marker genes offer increased resolution of for comparative microbiome studies.",

Using a rail system, mice are brought together to a distance where macrovibrissae of each mouse make contact. Cortical signals were recorded from both mice simultaneously before, during, and after the social contact period. When the mice were together, we observed bouts of mutual whisking and cross-mouse correlated cortical activity in the vibrissae cortex. This correlated activity was specific to individual interactions as the correlations fell in trial-shuffled mouse pairs. Whisk-related global GCAMP6s signals were greater in cagemate pairs during the together period. The effects of social interaction extend outside of regions associated with mutual touch and had global synchronizing effects on cortical activity.

    "abstract": "Telomerase maintains telomere length by reverse transcribing short G-rich DNA repeat sequences from its internal RNA template. G-rich telomere DNA repeats readily fold into G-quadruplex (GQ) structures in vitro, and the presence of GQ-prone sequences throughout the genome introduces challenges to replication in vivo. Using a combination of ensemble and single-molecule telomerase assays we discovered that GQ folding of the nascent DNA product during processive addition of multiple telomere repeats modulates the kinetics of telomerase catalysis and dissociation. Telomerase reactions performed with telomere DNA primers of varying sequence or using K+ versus Li+ salts yield changes in DNA product profiles consistent with formation of GQ structure within the telomerase-DNA complex. Single-molecule FRET experiments reveal complex DNA structural dynamics during real-time catalysis, supporting the notion of nascent product folding within the active telomerase complex. To explain the observed distributions of telomere products, we fit telomerase time series data to a global kinetic model that converges to a unique set of rate constants describing each successive telomere repeat addition cycle. Our results highlight the potential influence of the intrinsic folding properties of telomere DNA during telomerase catalysis and provide a detailed characterization of GQ modulation of polymerase function.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCETelomeres protect the ends of linear chromosomes from illicit DNA processing events that can threaten genome stability. Telomere structure is built upon repetitive G-rich DNA repeat sequences that have the ability to fold into stable secondary structures called G-quadruplexes (GQs). In rapidly dividing cells, including the majority of human cancers, telomeres are maintained by the specialized telomerase enzyme. Thus, telomerase and its telomere DNA substrates represent important targets for developing novel cancer drugs. In this work, we provide evidence for GQ folding within the newly synthesized DNA product of an actively extending telomerase enzyme. Our results highlight the delicate interplay between the structural properties of telomere DNA and telomerase function.",

    "abstract": "Nassellaria are marine radiolarian protists belonging to the Rhizaria lineage. Their skeleton, made of opaline silica, exhibit an excellent fossil record, extremely valuable in micro-paleontological studies for paleo-environmental reconstruction. Yet, to date very little is known about the extant diversity and ecology of Nassellaria in contemporary oceans, and most of it is inferred from their fossil record. Here we present an integrative classification of Nassellaria based on taxonomical marker genes (18S and 28S ribosomal DNA) and morphological characteristics obtained by optical and scanning electron microscopy imaging. Our phylogenetic analyses distinguished 11 main morpho-molecular clades relying essentially on the overall morphology of the skeleton and not on internal structures as previously considered. Using fossil calibrated molecular clock we estimated the origin of Nassellaria among radiolarians primitive forms in the Devonian (ca. 420 Ma), that gave rise to living nassellarian groups in the Triassic (ca. 250 Ma), during the biggest diversification event over their evolutionary history. This morpho-molecular framework provides both a new morphological classification easier to identify under light microscopy and the basis for future molecular ecology surveys. Altogether, it brings a new standpoint to improve our scarce understanding of the ecology and worldwide distribution of extant nassellarians.",

    "abstract": "During photosynthesis plants fix CO2 from the atmosphere onto ribulose-bisphosphate producing 3-phosphoglycerate, which is reduced to triose phosphates (TPs). The TPs are then converted into the end products of photosynthesis. When a plant is photosynthesizing very quickly it may not be possible to commit photosynthate to end product as fast as it is produced, causing a decrease in available phosphate and limiting the rate of photosynthesis to the rate of triose phosphate utilization (TPU). The occurrence of an observable TPU limitation is highly variable based on species and especially growth conditions, with TPU capacity seemingly regulated to be in just slight excess of the likely photosynthetic rate. The physiological effects of TPU limitation are discussed with an emphasis on interactions between the Calvin-Benson cycle and the light reactions. Methods for detecting TPU-limited data from gas exchange data are detailed, and the impact on modeling of some physiological effects are shown. Special consideration is given to common misconceptions about TPU.\\n\\nHighlightPhotosynthetic triose phosphate utilization limitation is discussed, highlighting misleading points in physiology and focusing on regulation.",

They are the major targets for anti-resorptive therapies to manage osteoporosis, a major public health problem. Osteoclasts are giant multinucleated cells that can organize their a unique adhesion structure based on a belt of podosomes, which is the keystone of the bone resorption apparatus. We combined differential transcriptomics and siRNA screening approaches to get a broader view of cytoskeletal regulators that participate in the control of osteoclast cytoskeleton and identify novel regulators of bone resorption by osteoclasts. We identified 20 new candidate regulators of osteoclasts cytoskeleton including Fkbp15, Spire1, Tacc2 and RalA, for which we confirmed they are necessary for proper organization of the podosome belt. We also showed that Anillin, well known for its role during cytokinesis, is essential in osteoclasts for correct podosome patterning and efficient bone resorption. In particular, Anillin controls the levels of the GTPase RhoA, a known regulator of osteoclast cytoskeleton and resorption activity. Finally, we set up and validated an automated imaging strategy based on open-source software for automatic and objective measurement of actin cytoskeleton organization in osteoclasts. We provide these pipelines that are useful to automatically assess the effect of collections of siRNAs or chemical compounds on osteoclast cytoskeleton or differentiation.",

However, when different attributes impact on the decision process is a question that has received far less attention. Here, we investigated whether attribute consideration timing has a unique influence on decision making using a time-varying drift diffusion model and data from four separate experiments. Experimental manipulations of attention and neural activity demonstrated that we can dissociate the processes that determine the relative weighting strength and timing of attribute consideration. Thus, the processes determining either the weighting strengths or the timing of attributes in decision making can adapt independently to changes in the environment or goals. Quantifying these separate influences of timing and weighting on choice improves our understanding and predictions of individual differences in decision behaviour.",

    "abstract": "While new sequencing technologies have lowered financial barriers to whole genome sequencing, resulting assemblies are often fragmented and far from  finished. Subsequent improvements towards chromosomal-level status can be achieved by both experimental and computational approaches. Requiring only annotated assemblies and gene orthology data, comparative genomics approaches that aim to capture evolutionary signals to predict scaffold neighbours (adjacencies) offer potentially substantive improvements without the costs associated with experimental scaffolding or re-sequencing. We leverage the combined detection power of three such gene synteny-based methods applied to 21 Anopheles mosquito assemblies with variable contiguity levels to produce consensus sets of scaffold adjacency predictions. Three complementary validations were performed on subsets of assemblies with additional supporting data: six with physical mapping data; 13 with paired-end RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data; and three with new assemblies based on re-scaffolding or incorporating Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing data. Improved assemblies were built by integrating the consensus adjacency predictions with supporting experimental data, resulting in 20 new reference assemblies with improved contiguities. Combined with physical mapping data for six anophelines, chromosomal positioning of scaffolds improved assembly anchoring by 47% for A. funestus and 38% A. stephensi. Reconciling an A. funestus PacBio assembly with synteny-based and RNAseq-based adjacencies and physical mapping data resulted in a new 81.5% chromosomally mapped reference assembly and cytogenetic photomap. While complementary experimental data are clearly key to achieving high-quality chromosomal-level assemblies, our assessments and validations of gene synteny-based computational methods highlight the utility of applying comparative genomics approaches to improve community genomic resources.",

    "abstract": "The industrialization of farming has had an enormous impact. To most, this impact is viewed solely in the context of productivity, but the denser living conditions and shorter rearing periods of industrial livestock farms provide pathogens with an ideal opportunity to spread and evolve. For example, the industrialization of poultry farms drove the Mareks disease virus (MDV) to evolve from causing a mild paralytic syndrome to causing a highly contagious, globally prevalent, disease that can have up to a 100% mortality rate. Fortunately, the economic catastrophe that would occur from MDV evolution has been prevented through widespread use of live imperfect vaccines that limit disease symptoms, but fail to prevent transmission. Unfortunately, the continued rollout of such imperfect vaccines is steering the evolution of MDV towards an even greater virulence and an ability to evade vaccine protection. Thus, there is a need to investigate alternative economically viable control measures for their ability to inhibit MDV spread and evolution. In what follows we examine the economic viability of standard husbandry practices for their ability to inhibit the spread of both virulent MDV and very virulent MDV throughout an industrialized egg farm. To do this, we parameterized a dynamic MDV transmission model and calculate the loss in egg production due to disease. We find that the MDV strain as well as the cohort duration had the greatest influence on disease burden and hence egg production. Additionally, we find that the standard husbandry practice involving conventional cages, often referred to as \\\"battery cages\\\", results in the least per capita loss in egg production due to MDV infection when compared to alternative enriched or aviary (free-run) systems for virulent MDV, but not very virulent MDV, in which case the Aviary system performs the best. These results highlight an important cost that managers will face when implementing new hen husbandry practices.",

    "abstract": "The ability to behave differently according to the situation is essential for survival in a dynamic environment. This requires past experiences to be encoded and retrieved alongside the contextual schemas in which they occurred. The complementary learning systems theory suggests that these schemas are acquired through gradual learning via the neocortex and rapid learning via the hippocampus. However, it has also been shown that new information matching a preexisting schema can bypass the gradual learning process and be acquired rapidly, suggesting that the separation of memories into schemas is useful for flexible learning. While there are theories of the role of schemas in memory consolidation, we lack a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying this function. For this reason, we created a biologically plausible neural network model of schema consolidation that studies several brain areas and their interactions. The model uses a rate-coded multilayer neural network with contrastive Hebbian learning to learn context-specific tasks. Our model suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex supports context-dependent behaviors by learning representations of schemas. Additionally, sparse random connections in the model from the ventral hippocampus to the hidden layers of the network gate neuronal activity depending on their involvement within the current schema, thus separating the representations of new and prior schemas. Contrastive Hebbian learning may function similarly to oscillations in the hippocampus, alternating between clamping and unclamping the output layer of the network to drive learning. Lastly, the model shows the vital role of neuromodulation, as a neuromodulatory area detects the certainty of whether new information is consistent with prior schemas and modulates the speed of memory encoding accordingly. Along with the insights that this model brings to the neurobiology of memory, it further provides a basis for creating context-dependent memories while preventing catastrophic forgetting in artificial neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Plasmids harbor transferable genes that contribute to the functional repertoire of microbial communities, yet their contributions to metagenomes are often overlooked. Environmental plasmids have the potential to spread antibiotic resistance to clinical microbial strains. In soils, high microbiome diversity and high variability in plasmid characteristics present a challenge for studying plasmids. To improve understanding of soil plasmids, we present RefSoil+, a database containing plasmid sequences from 922 soil microorganisms. Soil plasmids were relatively larger than other described plasmids, which is a trait associated with plasmid mobility. There was no relationship between chromosome size and plasmid size or number, suggesting that these genomic traits are independent in soil. Soil-associated plasmids, but not chromosomes, had fewer antibiotic resistance genes than other microorganisms. These data suggest that soils may offer limited opportunity for plasmid-mediated transfer of described antibiotic resistance genes. RefSoil+ can serve as a baseline for the diversity, composition, and host-associations of plasmid-borne functional genes in soil, a utility that will be enhanced as the database expands. Our study improves understanding of soil plasmids and provides a resource for assessing the dynamics of the genes that they carry, especially genes conferring antibiotic resistances.\\n\\nImportanceSoil-associated plasmids have the potential to transfer antibiotic resistance genes from environmental to clinical microbial strains, which is a public health concern.

In this study, DNA sequencing of the genes for GT and Acd LF221A on Lb. gasseri LA327 revealed that the amino acid sequences for GT completely corresponded with those of gat except for GatK (histidine kinase). However, those for the Acd LF221A had analogues which differed in at least one amino acid residue to be a putative class IIb bacteriocin designated as gassericin S (GS). By deletion test of GT structural genes (gatAX), the LA327 strain retained the bacteriocin activity, and the LA327 mutant strain lacking the ABC-type transporter gene (gatT) completely lost the bacteriocin activity. This indicates that LA327 strain is a GS producer, and GS production is performed via gat with the inclusion of gatT. Homologous expression using deletion mutants for GS and GT containing each single peptide elucidated that GS (GasAX) and GT (GatAX) showed synergistic activity as class IIb bacteriocins, respectively, and no synergistic activity was observed between each peptide of GS and GT. The molecular mass of GS was estimated to be theoretical ca. 5,400 Da by in situ activity assay after SDS-PAGE, clarifying that GS was actually expressed as an active class IIb bacteriocin. Furthermore, stability of GS expressed against pH, heat and protease was determined.\\n\\nImportanceWe determined the complete DNA sequence for GS, a novel class IIb bacteriocin of Lb. gasseri, and succeeded to express GS as active bacteriocins.

Veterinary medical records, a largely untapped data source that could benefit both human and non-human patients, could fill the gap.\n\nMaterials and MethodsIn this retrospective study, we trained long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on 52,722 human and 89,591 veterinary records. We established relevant baselines by training Decision Trees (DT) and Random Forests (RF) on the same data. We finally investigated the effect of merging data across clinical settings and probed model portability.\n\nResultsWe show that the LSTM-RNNs accurately classify veterinary/human text narratives into top-level categories with an average weighted macro F1, score of 0.735/0.675 respectively. The evaluation metric for the LSTM was 7 and 8% higher than that of the DT and RF models respectively. We generally did not find evidence of model portability albeit moderate performance increases in select categories.\n\nDiscussionWe see a strong positive correlation between number of training samples and classification performance, which is promising for future efforts. The use of LSTM-RNN models represents a scalable structure that could prove useful in cohort selection, which could in turn better address emerging public health concerns.\n\nConclusionDigitization of human and veterinary health information will continue to be a reality.

For some spine synapses, long and narrow spine necks provide strong diffusional and electrical isolation from the main dendrite, and it has been speculated that synapses on well isolated spines could be more plastic than synapses on spines with low resistance necks. Here we test this hypothesis by first measuring the diffusional resistance of spine necks, then pairing two-photon glutamate uncaging with bursts of back-propagating action potentials. Paired stimulation induced significant (155%) long-term potentiation (LTP) of synapses on weakly isolated spines, but no net functional change of synapses on highly isolated spines. No correlation was found between spine head volume and functional plasticity of the synapses. We conclude that contrary to our expectations, diffusional isolation makes potentiation of synapses more difficult. Our results support the concept that delivery of plasticity-related proteins from the dendrite into the spine is a limiting factor for LTP.",

    "abstract": "Replication protein A (RPA) coordinates important DNA metabolic events by stabilizing single-strand DNA (ssDNA) intermediates, activating the DNA damage response, and handing off ssDNA to appropriate downstream players. Six DNA binding domains (DBDs) in RPA promote high affinity binding to ssDNA, but also allow RPA displacement by lower affinity proteins. We have made fluorescent versions of RPA and visualized the conformational dynamics of individual DBDs in the context of the full-length protein. We show that both DBD-A and DBD-D rapidly bind to and dissociate from ssDNA, while RPA as a whole remains bound to ssDNA. The recombination mediator protein Rad52 selectively modulates the dynamics of DBD-D. This demonstrates how RPA interacting proteins, with lower ssDNA binding affinity, can access the occluded ssDNA and remodel individual DBDs to replace RPA.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe choreography of binding and rearrangement of the individual domains of RPA during homologous recombination is revealed.",

    "abstract": "We present the first comprehensive portrait of single-cell level transcriptional and cytokine signatures of anti-CD19 4-1BB/CD28/CD3{zeta} CAR-T cells upon antigen-specific stimulation. Both CD4+  helper and CD8+ cytotoxic CAR-T cells are equally effective in directly killing target tumor cells and their cytotoxic activity is associated with the elevation of a range of TH1 and TH2 signature cytokines (e.g., IFN{gamma}, TNF, IL5, and IL13), as confirmed by the expression of master transcription factors TBX21 (T-bet) and GATA3. However, rather than conforming to stringent TH1 or TH2 subtypes, single-cell analysis reveals that the predominant response is a highly mixed TH1/TH2 function in the same cell and the regulatory T cell (Treg) activity, although observed in a small fraction of activated cells, emerges from this hybrid TH1/TH2 population. GM-CSF is produced from the majority of cells regardless of the polarization states, further contrasting CAR-T to classic T cells. Surprisingly, the cytokine response is minimally associated with differentiation status although all major differentiation subsets such as naive, central memory, effector memory and effector are detected. All these suggest that the activation of CAR-engineered T cells is a canonical process that leads to a highly mixed response combining both type 1 and type 2 cytokines together with GMCSF, supporting the notion that  polyfunctional CAR-T cells correlate with objective response of patients in clinical trials. This work provides new insights to the mechanism of CAR activation and implies the necessity for cellular function assays to characterize the quality of CAR-T infusion products and monitor therapeutic responses in patients.",

Here we report a novel lipid mediator GPCR cross-talk mechanism that modulates lymphatic endothelial junctional architecture in lymph nodes. LPAR1 was identified as an inducer of S1PR1/ {beta}-arrestin coupling from a genome-wide CRISPR/ Cas9 transcriptional activation screen. LPAR1 activation induced S1PR1 {beta}-arrestin recruitment while suppressing Gi protein signaling. Lymphatic endothelial cells from cortical and medullary sinuses of lymph nodes which express LPAR1 and S1PR1, exhibit porous junctional architecture and constitutive S1PR1 coupling to {beta}-arrestin which was suppressed by the LPAR1 antagonist AM095. In endothelial cells, LPAR1-activation increased trans-endothelial permeability and junctional remodeling from zipper-like structures to puncta of adhesion plaques that terminate at actin-rich stress fibers with abundant intercellular gaps. Cross-talk between LPA and S1P receptors regulates complex junctional architecture of lymphatic sinus endothelial cells, a site of high lymphocyte traffic and lymph flow.",

    "abstract": "Integrin-mediated cell matrix adhesions are key to sensing the geometry and rigidity of the extracellular environment to regulate vital cellular processes. In vivo, the extracellular matrix (ECM) is composed of a fibrous mesh. To understand the geometry that supports adhesion formation on fibrous substrates, we patterned 10 nm gold-palladium single lines or pairs of lines (total width within 100 nm), mimicking thin single ECM fibers or a minimal mesh geometry, respectively and functionalized it with integrin binding ligand Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). Single lines showed reduced focal adhesion kinase (FAK) recruitment and did not support cell spreading or formation of focal adhesions, despite the presence of a high density of integrin-binding ligands. Using super resolution microscopy, we observed transient integrin clusters on single lines, whereas stable 110 nm integrin clusters formed on pairs of lines similar to those on continuous substrates. This indicated that two-dimensional ligand geometry is required for adhesion formation on rigid substrates. A mechanism to form modular 100nm integrin clusters bridging the minimal fiber mesh would require unliganded integrins. We observed that integrin mutants unable to bind ligand co-clustered with ligand-bound integrins when present in an active extended conformation. Thus, these results indicate that functional integrin clusters are required to form focal adhesions and unliganded integrins can co-cluster to bridge between thin matrix fibers and can form stable integrin adhesions on dense fibrous networks.",

    "abstract": "During a critical period in postnatal development, spontaneous and evoked retinal activity shape nascent visual pathways in an adaptive fashion. Visual experience increases transcription of the neurotrophin BDNF, activating the BDNF receptor TrkB, which promotes maturation of parvalbumin (PV) positive inhibitory interneurons, a process thought to open a critical period for ocular dominance plasticity in visual cortex. Development of perineuronal nets around PV neurons limits plasticity, ending the critical period and restricting adult plasticity. Another form of critical period plasticity is receptive field (RF) refinement. Spontaneous activity alone is sufficient for spatial refinement of visual receptive fields in superior colliculus (SC) and visual cortex (V1), but visual experience during an early critical period is necessary to maintain inhibitory synapses and stabilize RFs in adulthood (Carrasco et al. 2005, 2011; Carrasco & Pallas 2006; Balmer & Pallas 2015a). We report here that deprivation-induced RF enlargement in adulthood has a behavioral consequence; it impairs fear responses to looming objects in mice and hamsters. The mechanism through which early experience protects RFs from deprivation-induced loss of inhibition in adulthood is unknown. Given that the loss of RF refinement in SC does not occur until adulthood, and that inhibitory PV neurons and perineuronal nets are rare in SC, we asked whether or not BDNF-TrkB signaling was involved. We find that early TrkB activation is necessary and sufficient to maintain visual RF refinement in adulthood, suggesting a common signaling pathway for maturation of inhibition across neuronal subtypes and locations within the visual pathway.\\n\\nSignificance StatementReceptive field refinement in superior colliculus (SC) differs from more commonly studied examples of critical period plasticity in visual pathways in that it does not require visual experience to occur; rather spontaneous activity is sufficient. Maintenance of refinement requires brief, early exposure to light to stabilize inhibition beyond puberty. This type of inhibitory plasticity must not depend on parvalbumin (PV)-containing GABAergic interneurons or on the formation of perineuronal nets, because these are very uncommon in SC. Nonetheless, we find that TrkB activation during a critical period can substitute for visual experience in maintaining receptive field refinement into adulthood, and that this maintenance is beneficial to visual survival behaviors. Thus, multiple types of plasticity converge on the same neurotrophin-dependent signaling cascade.",

    "abstract": "The topographically ordered retinocollicular projection is an excellent system for studying the mechanism of axon guidance. Gradients of EphA receptors in the retina and ephrin-As in the superior colliculus (SC) pattern the anteroposterior axis of the retinocollicular map, but whether they are involved in map plasticity after injury is unknown. Partial damage to the caudal SC at birth creates a compressed, complete retinotopic map in the remaining SC without affecting visual response properties. Previously, we found that the gradient of ephrinA expression in compressed maps is steeper than normal, suggesting an instructive role in compression (Tadesse et al., 2013). Here we measured EphA5 mRNA and protein levels after caudal SC damage in order to test the hypothesis that changes in retinal EphA5 expression occur that are complementary to the changes in collicular ephrin-A expression. We find that the nasotemporal gradient of EphA5 receptor expression steepens in the retina and overall expression levels change dynamically, especially in temporal retina, supporting the hypothesis. This change in receptor expression occurs after the change in ephrin-A ligand expression. We propose that changes in the retinal EphA5 gradient guide recovery of the retinocollicular projection from early injury. This could occur directly through the change in EphA5 expression instructing retino-SC map compression, or through ephrinA ligand signaling instructing a change in EphA5 receptor expression that in turn signals the retinocollicular map to compress. Understanding what molecular signals direct compensation for injury is essential to developing rehabilitative strategies and maximizing the potential for recovery.",

    "abstract": "The endogenous metabolite methylglyoxal (MGO) has recently emerged as a potential mediator of psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression, but its precise mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Here, we find that MGO concentrations are decreased in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in rats subjected to chronic stress, and low-dose MGO treatment remarkedly enhances resilience to stress and alleviates depression-like symptoms. This effect is achieved by MGOs promotion on the synaptic plasticity in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments show that MGO provokes the dimerization and autophosphorylation of TrkB and the subsequent activation of downstream Akt/CREB signaling, which leads to a rapid and sustained expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We further demonstrate that MGO directly binds to the extracellular domain of TrkB, but not its intracellular domain. In addition, we also identify a natural product luteolin and its derivative lutD as potent inhibitors of Glyoxalase 1 and validate their antidepressant effects in chronic stress rat models. The antidepressant role of endogenous MGO provides a new basis for the understanding and therapeutic intervention design for stress-associated mental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by obsessive thinking, compulsive behavior, and anxiety, and is often accompanied by cognitive deficits. The neuropathology of OCD involves dysregulation of cortical-striatal circuits. Similar to OCD patients, SAPAP3 knockout mice 3 (SAPAP3-/-) exhibit compulsive behavior (grooming), anxiety, and dysregulated cortical-striatal function. However, it is unknown whether SAPAP3-/- display cognitive deficits and how these different behavioral traits relate to one another. SAPAP3-/- and wild-type littermates (WT) were trained in a Pavlovian conditioning task pairing the delivery of visual cues with that of sucrose solution. After mice learned to discriminate between a reward-predicting conditioned stimulus (CS+) and a non-reward stimulus (CS-), contingencies were reversed (CS+ became CS- and vice versa). Additionally, we assessed grooming, anxiety, and general activity. SAPAP3-/- acquired Pavlovian approach behavior similarly to WT, albeit less vigorously and with a different strategy. However, unlike WT, SAPAP3-/- were unable to adapt their behavior after contingency reversal, exemplified by a lack of re-establishing CS+ approach behavior (sign tracking). Surprisingly, such behavioral inflexibility, decreased vigor, compulsive grooming, and anxiety were unrelated. This study demonstrates that SAPAP3-/- are capable of Pavlovian learning, but lack flexibility to adapt associated conditioned approach behavior. Thus, SAPAP3-/- do not only display compulsive-like behavior and anxiety, but also cognitive deficits, confirming and extending the validity of SAPAP3-/- as a suitable model for OCD. The observation that compulsive-like behavior, anxiety, and behavioral inflexibility were unrelated suggests a non-causal relationship between these traits and may be of clinical relevance for OCD patients.",

    "abstract": "Genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs) are widely used to illuminate dynamic Ca2+ signaling activity in living cells and tissues. Various fluorescence colors of GECIs are available, including red. Red GECIs are promising because longer wavelengths of light scatter less in tissue, making it possible to image deeper. They are engineered from a circularly permuted red fluorescent protein fused to a Ca2+ sensing domain, calmodulin and a calmodulin-binding peptide. A conformational change in the sensing domain upon binding Ca2+ causes a change in the fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent protein. Three factors could contribute to this change in fluorescence: 1) a shift in the protonation state of the chromophore, 2) a change in fluorescence quantum yield, and 3) a change in the extinction coefficient for one-photon excitation or the two-photon cross section for two-photon excitation. We conducted a systematic study of the photophysical properties of a select cohort of red GECIs in their Ca2+-free and Ca2+-saturated states to determine which factors are most important for the Ca2+-dependent change in fluorescence. In total, we analyzed nine red GECIs, including jRGECO1a, K-GECO1, jRCaMP1a, R-GECO1, R-GECO1.2, CAR-GECO1, O-GECO1, REX-GECO1, and a new variant termed jREX-GECO1. We found that these red GECIs could be separated into three classes that each rely on a particular set of factors. Furthermore, in some cases the magnitude of the change in fluorescence was different depending on one-photon excitation or two-photon excitation by up to a factor of two.",
