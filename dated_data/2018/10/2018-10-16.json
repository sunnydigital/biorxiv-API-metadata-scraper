    "abstract": "Protein kinases catalyse the phosphorylation of target proteins, controlling most cellular processes. The specificity of serine/threonine kinases is partly determined by interactions with a few residues near the phospho-acceptor residue, forming the so-called kinase substrate motif. Kinases have been extensively duplicated throughout evolution but little is known about when in time new target motifs have arisen. Here we show that sequence variation occurring early in the evolution of kinases is dominated by changes in specificity determining residues. We then analysed kinase specificity models, based on known target sites, observing that specificity has remained mostly unchanged for recent kinase duplications. Finally, analysis of phosphorylation data from a taxonomically broad set of 48 eukaryotic species indicates that most phosphorylation motifs are broadly distributed in eukaryotes but not present in prokaryotes. Overall, our results suggest that the set of eukaryotes kinase motifs present today was acquired soon after the eukaryotic last common ancestor and that early expansions of the protein kinase fold rapidly explored the space of possible target motifs.",

    "abstract": "Interferon epsilon (IFN{varepsilon}) plays an important role in regulating protective immunity in the female reproductive tract in mouse models; but the expression and regulation of this IFN{varepsilon} in the human FRT had not yet been characterised. Here we show that IFN{varepsilon} is selectively and highly expressed in the human FRT, a unique characteristic among the many types of IFN. IFN{varepsilon} has distinct expression patterns in upper compared with lower FRT where it is predominantly expressed in the basal layers of the stratified squamous epithelia. We demonstrate direct regulation of IFN{varepsilon} expression is suppressed by progesterone consistent with its inverse correlation with progesterone receptor expression, but only in the endometrium where its expression therefore fluctuates throughout the menstrual cycle. We show that IFN{varepsilon} regulates immunoregulatory IFN regulated genes (IRGs) in FRT epithelial cells. The characterisation of huIFN{varepsilon} expression in both the upper and the lower FRT epithelia and its protective properties make this IFN well placed to be an important player in mediating hormonal control of FRT immune response and susceptibility to FRT infection.\\n\\nSummaryBourke et al. characterise the novel type I interferon epsilon (IFN{varepsilon}), as the only IFN constitutively expressed throughout the human female reproductive tract (FRT), where it is hormonally regulated and modules IFN dependent FRT immunity.",

    "abstract": "Transitions between wakefulness and anesthesia are accompanied by profound changes in brain functioning. A key challenge is thus to disentangle neuronal mechanisms specific to loss and recovery of consciousness, from more general effects that are not directly related to the capacity for conscious experience. Measures of neuronal diversity have been recently proposed to constitute a robust correlate of the global states of consciousness. In the present study we investigated whether EEG signal diversity is indeed related to behavioral responsiveness during propofol sedation, or rather to the general drug-related effects. To this end, we reanalyzed data collected from 20 subjects sedated with propofol. Based on the responsiveness to auditory stimuli all subjects were subdivided into two subgroups - responsive (n = 13), who remains awake throughout the experiment, and drowsy (n = 7), who becomes unresponsive during moderate sedation. Resting state EEG recorded during wakefulness and sedation was characterized by the Mean Information Gain (MIG) and Fluctuation complexity (FC) - information-theory measures estimating signal diversity or complexity, respectively. The main finding is that the drowsy group exhibited a decrease in diversity during sedation but, unexpectedly, the responsive group exhibited a robust increase in diversity (ANOVA group x state interaction: F(3) = 7.81, p < 0.001; BF10 > 197). However, signal complexity neither differentiated the subgroups, nor decreased reliably during sedation (t-test wake vs. moderate sedation: t(19) = 2.57, p = 0.092; BF10 = 3.08). Further, we show that a change in signal diversity is negatively correlated with a delta power change (r = -0.62, p = 0.002), and positively correlated with a beta power change (r = 0.84, p < 0.001). Finally, we show that MIG behaves in a qualitatively similar manner to Lempel-Ziv - another diversity measures used in several recent studies. Overall, we revealed that propofol sedation is initially related to an increase in EEG signal diversity, and that only upon loss of responsiveness EEG diversity decreases. The qualitatively different pattern of changes in the responsive and drowsy groups makes EEG diversity a robust indirect index of responsiveness and, presumably, consciousness.",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in perception are widespread. Considering inter-individual variability, synesthetes experience stable additional sensations; schizophrenia patients suffer perceptual deficits in e.g. perceptual organization (alongside hallucinations and delusions). Is there a unifying principle explaining inter-individual variability in perception? There is good reason to believe perceptual experience results from inferential processes whereby sensory evidence is weighted by prior knowledge about the world. Different perceptual phenotypes may result from different precision weighting of sensory evidence and prior knowledge. We tested this hypothesis by comparing visibility thresholds in a perceptual hysteresis task across medicated schizophrenia patients, synesthetes, and controls. Participants rated the subjective visibility of stimuli embedded in noise while we parametrically manipulated the availability of sensory evidence. Additionally, precise long-term priors in synesthetes were leveraged by presenting either synesthesia-inducing or neutral stimuli. Schizophrenia patients showed increased visibility thresholds, consistent with overreliance on sensory evidence. In contrast, synesthetes exhibited lowered thresholds exclusively for synesthesia-inducing stimuli suggesting high-precision long-term priors. Additionally, in both synesthetes and schizophrenia patients explicit, short-term priors - introduced during the hysteresis experiment - lowered thresholds but did not normalize perception. Our results imply that distinct perceptual phenotypes might result from differences in the precision afforded to prior beliefs and sensory evidence, respectively.",

Although retrotransposons are usually repressed, they become active in several human cancers, in particular those of the gastrointestinal tract. Here we characterize retrotransposon insertions in 202 colorectal tumor whole genomes and investigate their associations with molecular and clinical characteristics. We found highly variable retrotransposon activity among tumors and identified recurrent insertions in 15 known cancer genes. In approximately 1% of the cases we identified insertions in APC, likely to be tumor-initiating events. Insertions were positively associated with the CpG island methylator phenotype and the genomic fraction of allelic imbalance. Clinically, high number of insertions was independently associated with poor disease-specific survival.",

    "abstract": "Loss of smell is an early indicator of Alzheimers disease (AD), making the olfactory system an accessible model to study the effect of AD related proteins such as Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). The regenerative capacity of the system further enables studies of circuit recovery after APP-induced degeneration. While the cellular effects of APP are well documented, little is known about its effects on brain circuits at the ultrastructural level. To study circuitry changes, we overexpressed humanized APP with familial AD mutations (hAPP) in olfactory sensory neurons and performed serial electron microscopy on olfactory bulb glomeruli from both control and hAPP expressing mice. We found that hAPP-expressing mice showed a striking decrease in glomerular connectivity along with widespread changes of subcellular structures. By then turning off hAPP expression for 6 weeks we tested the capacity of glomerular circuits to recover and found clear restoration of both connectivity and subcellular features, including an increase in post-synaptic density to above the control level. These data provide an important ultrastructural view of olfactory regions associated with AD and suggest that circuit recovery is possible in brain tissue that has experienced APP-induced neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiota changes are associated with increased risk of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Through serum metabolome profiling in patients with cardiometabolic disease (CMD) we identified significant inverse correlation between the microbial metabolite 4-cresol and T2D. Chronic administration of non toxic dose of 4-cresol in two complementary preclinical models of CMD reduced adiposity, glucose intolerance and liver triglycerides, and enhanced insulin secretion in vivo, which may be explained by markedly increased pancreas weight, augmented islet density and size, and enhanced vascularisation suggesting activated islet neogenesis. Incubation of isolated islets with 4-cresol enhanced insulin secretion, insulin content and cell proliferation. In both CMD models 4-cresol treatment in vivo was associated with altered expression of SIRT1 and the kinase DYRK1A, which may contribute to mediate its biological effects. Our findings identify 4-cresol as an effective regulator of {beta}-cell function and T2D endophenotypes, which opens therapeutic perspectives in syndromes of insulin deficiency.",

We isolated Rysto using Resistance gene enrichment sequencing (RenSeq) and PacBio SMRT (Pacific Biosciences Single-Molecule Real Time Sequencing). Rysto encodes a nucleotide binding-leucine rich repeat (NLR) protein with an N-terminal TIR domain, and is sufficient for PVY perception and extreme resistance in transgenic potato plants. We investigated the requirements for Rysto-dependent extreme resistance, and showed that Rysto function is temperature-independent and requires EDS1 and NRG1 proteins. Rysto may prove valuable for creating PVY-resistant cultivars of potato and other Solanaceae crops.",

Altered Insulin Receptor (IR) signaling is a common feature of both diseases, and insulin has potent bone anabolic functions. Several previous studies have demonstrated that loss of IR in bone cells results in disrupted bone homeostasis during early post-natal growth. Here we have deleted IR in S100a4-lineage cells (IRcKOS100a4) and assessed the effects on bone homeostasis at both young (15 weeks) and older adult (48 weeks) mice. S100a4-cre has previously been shown to target the perichondrium during bone development, and here we show that S100a4 is expressed by adult trabecular and cortical bone cells, and that S100a4-Cre effectively targets adult bone, resulting in efficient deletion of IR. Deletion of IR in S100a4-lineage cells does effect initial bone acquisition or homeostasis with no changes in cortical, trabecular or mechanical properties at 15-weeks of age, relative to wild type (WT) littermates. However, by 48-weeks of age, IRcKOS100a4 mice display substantial declines in trabecular bone volume, bone volume fraction and torsional rigidity, relative to age-matched WT controls. This work establishes the utility of using S100a4-cre to target bone and demonstrates that IR in S100a4-lineage cells is required for maintenance of bone homeostasis in adult mice.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLeishmaniasis encompasses a group of diverse clinical diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus. This disease is a major public health problem in the New World affecting people exposed in endemic regions. The city of Governador Valadares (Minas Gerais/Brazil) is a re-emerging area for visceral leishmaniasis, with 191 human cases reported from 2008 to 2017 and a lethality rate of 14.7%. The transmission of the parasite occurs intensely in this region with up to 22% of domestic dogs with positive serology for the visceral form. Lu. longipalpis is one of the most abundant sand fly species in this area. Despite this scenario, so far there is no information regarding the circulating Leishmania species in the insect vector Lutzomyia longipalpis in this focus.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal FindingsWe collected 616 female Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies between January and September 2015 in the Vila Parque Ibituruna neighborhood (Governador Valadares/MG), which is located on a transitional area between the sylvatic and urban environments with residences built near a preserved area. After DNA extraction of individual sand flies, the natural Leishmania infections in Lu. longipalpis were detected by end-point PCR, using primers derived from kDNA sequences, specific for L. (Leishmania) or L. (Viannia) subgenus. The sensitivity of these PCR reactions was 0.1 pg of DNA for each Leishmania subgenus and the total infection rate of 16.2% (100 positive specimens). Species-specific PCR detected the presence of multiple Leishmania species in infected Lu. longipalpis specimens in Governador Valadares, including L. amazonensis (n=3), L. infantum (n=28), L. (Viannia) spp. (n=20), coinfections with L. infantum and L. (Viannia) spp. (n=5), and L. (Leishmania) spp (n=44).\\n\\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate that multiple Leishmania species circulate in Lu. longipalpis in Governador Valadares and reveal a potential increasing risk of transmission of the different circulating parasite species. This information is a key factor for planning surveillance and effective control strategies against leishmaniasis in this endemic focus.\\n\\nAuthor summaryLeishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease transmitted to mammals by the bite of sand flies infected with parasites of the Leishmania genus. This disease affects millions of people in various regions of the world, including Brazil. The municipality of Governador Valadares (Minas Gerais/Brazil) is a re-emergent focus of intense transmission of leishmaniasis, with a high number of human cases and a high prevalence of infected domestic dogs. To develop better leishmaniasis control strategies for the region, we performed a surveillance study of Lu. longipalpis, the main vector of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil, and identified circulating species of Leishmania in this insect vector. We estimate that the natural infection rate of Lu. longipalpis for these parasites was of 16.2% in the study area. We also detected the presence of multiple circulating Leishmania species (L. amazonensis, L. infantum and Viannia subgenus) in Lu. longipalpis in Governador Valadares city, including 5 sand flies coinfected with L. infantum and L. (Viannia). Thus, our results reinforce the need for a rigid and systematic control of the sand flies monitoring in this area, due to the potential risk of transmission of different species of the Leishmania parasites.",

    "abstract": "When different genotypes choose different habitats to better match their phenotypes, adaptive differentiation within a population may be promoted. Mating within those habitats may subsequently contribute to reproductive isolation. In cichlid fish, visual adaptation to alternative visual environments is hypothesised to contribute to speciation. Here, we investigated whether variation in visual sensitivity causes different visual habitat preferences, using two closely related cichlid species that occur at different but overlapping water depths in Lake Victoria and that differ in visual perception (Pundamilia sp.). In addition to species differences, we explored potential effects of visual plasticity, by rearing fish in two different light conditions: broad-spectrum (mimicking shallow water) or red-shifted (mimicking deeper waters). Contrary to expectations, fish did not prefer the light environment that mimicked their typical natural habitat. Instead, we found an overall preference for the broad-spectrum environment. We also found a transient influence of the rearing condition, indicating that assessment of microhabitat preference requires repeated testing to control for familiarity effects. Together, our results show that cichlid fish exert visual habitat preference, but do not support straightforward visual habitat matching.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive knowledge of the types and ratios of microbes that inhabit the healthy human gut is necessary before any kind of pre-clinical or clinical study can be performed that attempts to alter the microbiome to treat a condition or improve therapy outcome. To address this need we present an innovative scalable comprehensive analysis workflow, a healthy human reference microbiome list and abundance profile (GutFeelingKB), and a novel Fecal Biome Population Report (FecalBiome) with clinical applicability. GutFeelingKB provides a list of 157 organisms (8 phyla, 18 classes, 23 orders, 38 families, 59 genera and 109 species) that forms the baseline biome and therefore can be used as healthy controls for studies related to dysbiosis. The incorporation of microbiome science into routine clinical practice necessitates a standard report for comparison of an individuals microbiome to the growing knowledgebase of \\\"normal\\\" microbiome data. The FecalBiome and the underlying technology of GutFeelingKB address this need. The knowledgebase can be useful to regulatory agencies for the assessment of fecal transplant and other microbiome products, as it contains a list of organisms from healthy individuals. In addition to the list of organisms and abundances the study also generated a list of contigs of metagenomics dark matter. In this study, metagenomic dark matter represents sequences that cannot be mapped to any known sequence but can be assembled into contigs of 10,000 nucleotides or higher. These sequences can be used to create primers to study potential novel organisms. All data is freely available from https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/gfkb and NCBIs Short Read Archive.",

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of the larval zebrafish as a systems neuroscience model has been driven largely by its small size and optical transparency, which enable the use of imaging and optogenetics techniques to record and manipulate activity throughout the brain. Unfortunately, larval fish lack the mature behavioral repertoire of adults and so a number of learning phenomena and social behaviors cannot be investigated in these animals. Here we establish the pedomorphic fish species Danionella translucida as a laboratory model that overcomes this limitation. Adult Danionella possess the size and optical transparency of late-larval zebrafish, which we exploit to image deep within the brains of a behaviorally mature animals using two-photon microscopy. The close phylogenetic relationship between Danionella and zebrafish enabled us to use existing reagents and techniques for transgenesis, and zebrafish-derived enhancer elements drove transgene expression in Danionella with their intended specificities. In a behavioral assay for socially-reinforced place preference, interactions between fish were found to be positively reinforcing and dependent on gender, demonstrating the power of this species for studies of learning and memory as well as social behavior. The establishment of Danionellas behavioral, molecular, and optical tractability provides a unique opportunity for researchers seeking to understand the relationship between circuits and adult-onset behaviors at a whole-brain level.",

    "abstract": "Human genetic disorders provide a powerful lens to understanding the human brain. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) represent an important, new resource for mechanistic studies and therapeutic development. Christianson syndrome (CS), an X-linked neurological disorder with attenuation of brain growth postnatally (postnatal microcephaly), is caused by mutations in SLC9A6, the gene encoding endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger 6 (NHE6). We developed CS iPSC lines from patients with a mutational spectrum, as well as robust biologically-related and isogenic controls. We demonstrate that mutations in CS lead to loss of protein function by a variety of mechanisms. Regardless of mutation, all patient-derived neurons demonstrate reduced neurite growth and arborization, likely underlying diminished postnatal brain growth in patients. Additionally, phenotype rescue strategies show allele-specific responses: a gene replacement strategy shows efficacy in nonsense mutations but not in a missense mutation, whereas application of exogenous trophic factors (BDNF or IGF-1) rescues arborization phenotypes across all mutations. Our data emphasize the important principle of personalized medicine whereby success of some therapeutic strategies may be more linked to patient genotype than others.",

    "abstract": "Brain trauma triggers a cascade of deleterious events leading to enhanced incidence of drug resistant epilepsies, depression and cognitive dysfunctions. The underlying mechanisms leading to these alterations are poorly understood and treatment that attenuates those sequels not available. Using controlled-cortical impact (CCI) as experimental model of brain trauma in adult mouse we found a strong suppressive effect of the sodium-potassium-chloride importer (NKCC1) specific antagonist bumetanide on appearance of depression-like behavior. We demonstrate that this alteration in behavior is associated with a block of CCI-induced decrease in parvalbumin-positive interneurons and impairment of post-traumatic secondary neurogenesis within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The mechanism mediating the effect of bumetanide involves early transient changes in expression of chloride regulatory proteins and qualitative changes in GABA(A) mediated transmission after brain trauma. This work opens new perspectives in the early treatment of human post-traumatic induced depression. Our results strongly suggest that bumetanide might constitute an efficient prophylactic treatment to reduce neurological and psychiatric consequences of brain trauma.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell protein expression time trajectories provide rich temporal data quantifying cellular variability and its role in dictating fitness. However, theoretical models to analyze and fully extract information from these measurements remain limited for three reasons: i) gene expression profiles are noisy, rendering models of averages inapplicable, ii) experiments typically measure only a few protein species while leaving other molecular actors - necessary to build traditional bottom-up models - unnoticed, and iii) measured data is in fluorescence, not particle number. We have recently addressed these challenges in an alternate top-down approach using the principle of Maximum Caliber (MaxCal) to model genetic switches with one and two protein species. In the present work we address scalability and broader applicability of MaxCal by extending to a three-gene (A, B, C) feedback network that exhibits oscillation, commonly known as the repressilator. We test MaxCals inferential power by using synthetic data of noisy protein number time traces - serving as a proxy for experimental data - generated from a known underlying model. We notice that the minimal MaxCal model - accounting for production, degradation, and only one type of symmetric coupling between all three species - reasonably infers several underlying features of the circuit such as the effective production rate, degradation rate, frequency of oscillation, and protein number distribution. Next, we build models of higher complexity including different levels of coupling between A, B, and C and rigorously assess their relative performance. While the minimal model (with four parameters) performs remarkably well, we note that the most complex model (with six parameters) allowing all possible forms of crosstalk between A, B, and C slightly improves prediction of rates, but avoids ad-hoc assumption of all the other models. It is also the model of choice based on Bayesian Information Criteria. We further analyzed time trajectories in arbitrary fluorescence (using synthetic trajectories) to mimic realistic data. We conclude that even with a three-protein system including both fluorescence noise and intrinsic gene expression fluctuations, MaxCal can faithfully infer underlying details of the network, opening up future directions to model other network motifs with many species.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSex chromosomes are typically comprised of a non-recombining region and a recombining pseudoautosomal region. Accurately quantifying the relative size of these regions is critical for sex chromosome biology both from a functional (i.e. number of sex-linked genes) and evolutionary perspective (i.e. extent of Y degeneration and X-Y heteromorphy). The evolution of the pseudoautosomal boundary (PAB) - the limit between the recombining and the non-recombining regions of the sex chromosomes - is well documented in haplorrhines (apes and monkeys) but not in strepsirrhines (lemurs and lorises), which represent almost 30% of all primates. Here we studied the PAB of seven species representing the main strepsirrhine lineages by sequencing a male and a female genome in each species and using sex differences in coverage to identify the PAB. We found that during primate evolution, the PAB has remained unchanged in strepsirrhines whereas several recombination suppression events moved the PAB and shortened the pseudoautosomal region in haplorrhines. Strepsirrhines are well known to have much lower sexual dimorphism than haplorrhines. We suggest that mutations with antagonistic effects between males and females have driven recombination suppression and PAB evolution in haplorrhines. Our work supports the view that sexually antagonistic mutations have influenced the evolution of sex chromosomes in primates.",

    "abstract": "In development, wound healing, and pathology, cell biomechanical properties are increasingly recognized as being of central importance. To measure these properties, experimental probes of various types have been developed, but how each probe reflects the properties of heterogeneous cell regions has remained obscure. To better understand differences attributable to the probe technology, as well as to define the relative sensitivity of each probe to different cellular structures, here we took a comprehensive approach. We studied two cell types --Schlemms canal (SC) endothelial cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) - using four different probe technologies: 1) atomic force microscopy (AFM) with sharp-tip; 2) AFM with round-tip; 3) optical magnetic twisting cytometry (OMTC); and 4) traction microscopy (TM). Perturbation of SC cells with dexamethasone treatment, a-actinin overexpression, or Rho-A overexpression caused increases in traction reported by TM and stiffness reported by sharp-tip AFM, as compared to corresponding controls. By contrast, under these same experimental conditions, stiffness reported by round-tip AFM and by OMTC indicated little change. Knock out (KO) of vimentin in MEFs caused a diminution of traction reported by TM, as well as stiffness reported by sharp-tip and round-tip AFM. However, stiffness reported by OMTC in vimentin KO MEFs was greater than in wild-type. Finite element analysis demonstrated that this paradoxical OMTC result in vimentin KO MEFs could be attributed to reduced cell thickness. Our results also suggest that vimentin contributes not only to intracellular network stiffness but also cortex stiffness. Taken together, this evidence suggests that AFM sharp-tip and TM emphasize properties of the actin-rich shell of the cell whereas round-tip AFM and OMTC emphasize those of the non-cortical intracellular network.",

    "abstract": "We propose an integro-differential description of the dynamics of the fitness distribution in an asexual population under mutation and selection, in the presence of a phenotype optimum. Due to the presence of this optimum, the distribution of mutation effects on fitness depends on the parents fitness, leading to a non-standard equation with \\\"context-dependent\\\" mutation kernels.\\n\\nUnder general assumptions on the mutation kernels, which encompass the standard n dimensional Gaussian Fishers geometrical model (FGM), we prove that the equation admits a unique time-global solution. Furthermore, we derive a nonlocal nonlinear transport equation satisfied by the cumulant generating function of the fitness distribution. As this equation is the same as the equation derived by Martin and Roques (2016) while studying stochastic Wright-Fisher-type models, this shows that the solution of the main integro-differential equation can be interpreted as the expected distribution of fitness corresponding to this type of microscopic models, in a deterministic limit. Additionally, we give simple sufficient conditions for the existence/non-existence of a concentration phenomenon at the optimal fitness value, i.e, of a Dirac mass at the optimum in the stationary fitness distribution. We show how it determines a phase transition, as mutation rates increase, in the value of the equilibrium mean fitness at mutation-selection balance. In the particular case of the FGM, consistently with previous studies based on other formalisms (Waxman and Peck, 1998, 2006), the condition for the existence of the concentration phenomenon simply requires that the dimension n of the phenotype space be larger than or equal to 3 and the mutation rate U be smaller than some explicit threshold.\\n\\nThe accuracy of these deterministic approximations are further checked by stochastic individual-based simulations.",

    "abstract": "A conceptual paradigm for onset of a new disease is often considered to be the result of changes in entire biological networks whose states are affected by a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. However, when modelling a relevant phenotype as a function of high dimensional measurements, power to estimate interactions is low, the number of possible interactions could be enormous and their effects may be non-linear. In this work, we introduce a method called sail for detecting non-linear interactions with a key environmental or exposure variable in high-dimensional settings which respects the strong or weak heredity constraints. We prove that asymptotically, our method possesses the oracle property, i.e., it performs as well as if the true model were known in advance. We develop a computationally efficient fitting algorithm with automatic tuning parameter selection, which scales to high-dimensional datasets. Through an extensive simulation study, we show that sail outperforms existing penalized regression methods in terms of prediction accuracy and support recovery when there are non-linear interactions with an exposure variable. We apply sail to detect non-linear interactions between genes and a prenatal psychosocial intervention program on cognitive performance in children at 4 years of age. Results show that individuals who are genetically predisposed to lower educational attainment are those who stand to benefit the most from the intervention.

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn recent years, research on cancer predisposition germline variants has emerged as a prominent field. The identity of somatic mutations is based on a reliable mapping of the patient germline variants. In addition, the statistics of germline variants frequencies in healthy individuals and cancer patients is the basis for seeking candidates for cancer predisposition genes. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is one of the main sources of such data, providing a diverse collection of molecular data including deep sequencing for more than 30 types of cancer from >10,000 patients.\\n\\nMethodsOur hypothesis in this study is that whole exome sequences from healthy blood samples of cancer patients are not expected to show systematic differences among cancer types. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed common and rare germline variants across six cancer types, covering 2,241 samples from TCGA. In our analysis we accounted for inherent variables in the data including the different variant calling protocols, sequencing platforms, and ethnicity.\\n\\nResultsWe report on substantial batch effects in germline variants associated with cancer types. We attribute the effect to the specific sequencing centers that produced the data. Specifically, we measured 30% variability in the number of reported germline variants per sample across sequencing centers. The batch effect is further expressed in nucleotide composition and variant frequencies. Importantly, the batch effect causes substantial differences in germline variant distribution patterns across numerous genes, including prominent cancer predisposition genes such as BRCA1, RET, MAX, and KRAS. For most of known cancer predisposition genes, we found a distinct batch-dependent difference in germline variants.\\n\\nConclusionTCGA germline data is exposed to strong batch effects with substantial variabilities among TCGA sequencing centers. We claim that those batch effects are consequential for numerous TCGA pan-cancer studies. In particular, these effects may compromise the reliability and the potency to detect new cancer predisposition genes. Furthermore, interpretation of pan-cancer analyses should be revisited in view of the source of the genomic data after accounting for the reported batch effects.",

    "abstract": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that binds environmental toxins and regulates gene expression. AHR also regulates developmental processes, like craniofacial development and hematopoiesis, in the absence of environmental exposures. Zebrafish have three paralogues of AHR: ahr1a, ahr1b and ahr2. Adult zebrafish with mutations in ahr2 exhibited craniofacial and fin defects. However, the degree to which ahr1a and ahr1b influence ahr2 signaling and contribute to fin and craniofacial development are not known. We compared morphology of adult ahr2 mutants and ahr1a/ahr1b single and double mutant zebrafish. We found that ahr1a/ahr1b single and double mutants were morphologically normal while ahr2 mutant zebrafish demonstrated fin and craniofacial malformations. At 5 days post fertilization, both ahr1a/ahr1b and ahr2 mutant larvae were normal, suggesting that adult phenotypes are due to defects in maturation or maintenance. AHR was shown to interact with estrogen receptor alpha, yet it is not known whether these interactions are constitutive or dependent on ahr1 genes. To determine whether estrogen receptors are constitutive cofactors for AHR signaling, we used genetic and pharmacologic techniques to analyze TCDD-dependent toxicity in estrogen receptor and ahr mutant embryos. We found that embryos with mutations in ahr1a/ahr1b or estrogen receptor genes are susceptible to TCDD toxicity while ahr2 mutant embryos are TCDD-resistant. Moreover, pharmacologic blockade of nuclear estrogen receptors failed to prevent TCDD toxicity. These findings suggest that ahr1 genes do not have overlapping functions with ahr2 in fin and craniofacial development or TCDD-dependent toxicity, and that estrogen receptors are not constitutive partners of ahr2.",

With sour meads gaining popularity in modern mead making, we were interested in exploring the same primary souring approach to traditional semi-sweet meads. In this study, we utilized 13 LAY strains to produce semi-sweet meads using a standardized batch of honey must to ensure consistent starting conditions. Thirteen 11-L batches of mead were prepared, and each was inoculated with one of the LAY strains, along with two control batches inoculated with champagne yeast. The initial pH and specific gravity were measured for each batch before inoculation. Traditional organic staggered nutrient addition was utilized for the first 72 h of fermentation with specific gravities being taken throughout the mead making process. Meads were racked, tasted, stabilized, cold crashed, bottled, and transported to the American Mead Makers Association 2018 Conference in Broomfield, Colorado. There, organoleptic surveys were conducted on these meads utilizing an array of tasters with varying levels of mead sensory analysis experience.

    "abstract": "Evidence is rapidly mounting that transposable element expression and replication may impact biology more widely than previously thought. This includes potential effects on normal physiology of somatic tissues and dysfunctional impacts in diseases associated with aging such as cancer and neurodegeneration. Investigation of the biological impact of mobile elements in somatic cells will be greatly facilitated by use of donor elements that are engineered to report de novo events in vivo. In multicellular organisms, successful reporters of LINE element mobilization have been in use for some time, but similar strategies have not been developed to report Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and endogenous retroviruses. We describe Cellular Labeling of Endogenous Virus Replication (CLEVR), which reports replication of the gypsy element in Drosophila. The gypsy-CLEVR reporter reveals gypsy replication both in cell culture and in individual neurons and glial cells of the aging adult fly. We also demonstrate that the gypsy-CLEVR replication rate is increased when the short interfering RNA silencing system is genetically disrupted. This CLEVR strategy makes use of universally conserved features of retroviruses and should be widely applicable to other LTR-retrotransposons, endogenous retroviruses and exogenous retroviruses.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 Estrogen receptor-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvlEsr1) play a causal role in the control of social behaviors including aggression. Here we use six different viral-genetic tracing methods to map the connectional architecture of VMHvlEsr1 neurons. These data reveal a high level of input convergence and output divergence (\\\"fan-in/fan-out\\\") from and to over 30 distinct brain regions, with a high degree (~90%) of recurrence. Unlike GABAergic populations in other hypothalamic nuclei controlling feeding and parenting behavior, VMHvlEsr1 glutamatergic neurons collateralize to multiple targets. However, we identify two anatomically distinct subpopulations with anterior vs. posterior biases in their collateralization patterns. Surprisingly, these two subpopulations receive indistinguishable inputs. These studies suggest an overall system architecture in which an anatomically feed-forward sensory-to-motor processing stream is integrated with a dense, highly recurrent central processing circuit. This architecture differs from the \\\"brain-inspired\\\" feed-forward circuits used in certain types of artificial intelligence networks.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEHow the cellular heterogeneity of brain nuclei maps onto circuit connectivity, the relationship of this anatomical mapping to behavioral function, and whether there are general principles underlying this relationship, remains poorly understood. Here we systematically map the connectivity of estrogen receptor-1-expressing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvlEsr1), which control aggression and other social behaviors. We find that a relatively sparse, anatomically feed-forward sensory-to-motor processing stream is integrated with a dense, highly recurrent central processing circuit. Further, the VMHvl contains at least two subpopulations of Esr1+ neurons with different cell body characteristics and locations, with distinct patterns of collateralization to downstream targets. Nevertheless, these projection-defined subpopulations receive similar inputs. This input-output organization appears distinct from those described in other hypothalamic nuclei.",

We found systematic individual differences in fixation frequencies along six semantic stimulus dimensions. These differences were large (> twofold) and highly stable across images and time. Surprisingly, they also held for first fixations directed towards each image, commonly interpreted as  bottom-up visual salience. Their perceptual relevance was documented by a correlation between individual face salience and recognition skills. The dimensions of individual salience and their covariance pattern replicated across samples from three different countries, suggesting they reflect fundamental biological mechanisms of attention. Our findings show stable individual salience differences along semantic dimensions, with meaningful perceptual implications. Salience reflects features of the observer as well as the image.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic spines are small, bulbous protrusions along dendrites in neurons and play a critical role in synaptic transmission. Dendritic spines come in a variety of shapes that depend on their developmental state. Additionally, roughly 14-19% of mature spines have a specialized endoplasmic reticulum called the spine apparatus. How does the shape of a postsynaptic spine and its internal organization affect the spatio-temporal dynamics of short timescale signaling? Answers to this question are central to our understanding the initiation of synaptic transmission, learning, and memory formation. In this work, we investigated the effect of spine and spine apparatus size and shape on the spatio-temporal dynamics of second messengers using mathematical modeling using reaction-diffusion equations in idealized geometries (ellipsoids, spheres, and mushroom-shaped). Our analyses and simulations showed that in the short timescale, spine size and shape coupled with the spine apparatus geometries govern the spatiotemporal dynamics of second messengers. We show that the curvature of the geometries gives rise to pseudo-harmonic functions, which predict the locations of maximum and minimum concentrations along the spine head. Furthermore, we showed that the lifetime of the concentration gradient can be fine-tuned by localization of fluxes on the spine head and varying the relative curvatures and distances between the spine apparatus and the spine head. Thus, we have identified several key geometric determinants of how the spine head and spine apparatus may regulate the short timescale chemical dynamics of small molecules that control synaptic plasticity.",

In order to test this hypothesis, we sought to identify transcriptomic changes in post-natal cord blood samples following prolonged pre-labour rupture of membranes (PROM) as a surrogate for increased risk of infection. By comparison to controls we found increased levels of blood transcripts in a subset of prolonged PROM cases, significantly enriched for innate immune system signalling pathways. These changes were idiosyncratic, suggesting qualitative and quantitative variation in foetal immune responses which may reflect differences in exposure and/or in host genetics. Our data support the view that PROM represents an infection risk to the foetus. In addition, we propose that cord blood transcriptional profiling offers exciting opportunities to identify immune correlates of clinical outcome following potential in utero exposures to infection.

Although HSF2BP was previously described as testis-specific, we find it is expressed in mouse ES cells, in human cancer cell lines, and in tumor samples. Elevated levels of HSF2BP sensitize human cells to ICL-inducing agents (mitomycin C and cisplatin) and PARP inhibitors, resulting in a phenotype characteristic of cells from Fanconi anemia (FA) patients. We biochemically recapitulate the suppression of ICL repair and establish that excess HSF2BP specifically compromises homologous recombination by preventing BRCA2 and RAD51 loading at the ICL. As increased ectopic expression of HSF2BP occurs naturally, we suggest that it can be considered as a causative agent in FA and a source of cancer-promoting genomic instability.",

    "abstract": "Homologous chromosomes colocalize to regulate gene expression in processes including genomic imprinting and X-inactivation, but the mechanisms driving these interactions are poorly understood. In Drosophila, homologous chromosomes pair throughout development, promoting an interchromosomal gene regulatory mechanism called transvection. Despite over a century of study, the molecular features that facilitate chromosome-wide pairing are unknown. The \\\"button\\\" model of pairing proposes that specific regions along chromosomes pair with a higher affinity than their surrounding regions, but only a handful of DNA elements that drive homologous pairing between chromosomes have been described. Here, we identify button loci interspersed across the fly genome that have the ability to pair with their homologous sequences. Buttons are characterized by topologically associated domains (TADs), which drive pairing with their endogenous loci from multiple locations in the genome. Fragments of TADs do not pair, suggesting a model in which combinations of elements interspersed along the full length of a TAD are required for pairing. Though DNA-binding insulator proteins are not associated with pairing, buttons are enriched for insulator cofactors, suggesting that these proteins may mediate higher order interactions between homologous TADs. Using a TAD spanning the spinelessd gene as a paradigm, we find that pairing is necessary but not sufficient for transvection. spineless pairing and transvection are cell-type-specific, suggesting that local buttoning and unbuttoning regulates transvection efficiency between cell types. Together, our data support a model in which specialized TADs button homologous chromosomes together to facilitate cell-type-specific interchromosomal gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Defining the transcriptomic identity of clonally related malignant cells is challenging in the absence of cell surface markers that distinguish cancer clones from one another or from admixed non-neoplastic cells. While single-cell methods have been devised to capture both the transcriptome and genotype, these methods are not compatible with droplet-based single-cell transcriptomics, limiting their throughput. To overcome this limitation, we present single-cell Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT), which integrates cDNA genotyping with high-throughput droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq. We further demonstrate that multiplexed GoT can interrogate multiple genotypes for distinguishing subclonal transcriptomic identity. We apply GoT to 26,039 CD34+ cells across six patients with myeloid neoplasms, in which the complex process of hematopoiesis is corrupted by CALR-mutated stem and progenitor cells. We define high-resolution maps of malignant versus normal hematopoietic progenitors, and show that while mutant cells are comingled with wildtype cells throughout the hematopoietic progenitor landscape, their frequency increases with differentiation. We identify the unfolded protein response as a predominant outcome of CALR mutations, with significant cell identity dependency. Furthermore, we identify that CALR mutations lead to NF-{kappa}B pathway upregulation specifically in uncommitted early stem cells. Collectively, GoT provides high-throughput linkage of single-cell genotypes with transcriptomes and reveals that the transcriptional output of somatic mutations is heavily dependent on the native cell identity.",

    "abstract": "Synergistic interactions between macromolecular crowding and confinement spatially organize transcription and translation in cells. Yet, reproducing such spatial ordering in cell-free expression platforms has proven to be elusive. Here we report crowding- and confinement-driven spatial self-organization of cell-free expression that mimics expression behavior within and around the nucleoid of prokaryotes. These experiments use Ficoll-70 to approximate cellular macromolecular crowding conditions within cell-size lipid vesicles. Intriguingly, there was an abrupt change in transcriptional dynamics when crowding reached physiologically relevant levels. Imaging experiments revealed that this change in transcriptional dynamics was coincident with localization of plasmid DNA and mRNA at the vesicle wall. Computer simulations demonstrated that crowding leads to an entropically induced attraction between plasmid DNA and the wall, causing localization of DNA near the wall at sufficiently high crowding levels. The experiments demonstrate cell-like spatial organization of translation, where translational activity is controlled by chromosomally-templated positioning of mRNA. This cell-free system provides a flexible experimental platform to probe the underlying mechanisms of self-organization of membrane-less structures in cells and the spatial control of gene expression.",
