    "abstract": "Although large amounts of genomic data are available, it remains a challenge to reliably infer causal (i.e., regulatory) relationships among molecular phenotypes (such as gene expression), especially when many phenotypes are involved. We extend the interpretation of the Principle of Mendelian randomization (PMR) and present MRPC, a novel machine learning algorithm that incorporates the PMR in classical algorithms for learning causal graphs in computer science. MRPC learns a causal biological network efficiently and robustly from integrating genotype and molecular phenotype data, in which directed edges indicate causal directions. We demonstrate through simulation that MRPC outperforms existing general-purpose network inference methods and other PMR-based methods. We apply MRPC to distinguish direct and indirect targets among multiple genes associated with expression quantitative trait loci.",

We proposed a statistical description of the locomotor activity tracks and transformed the provided time series into vectors representing physiological states for each participant. The Principal Components Analysis of the transformed data revealed a winding trajectory with distinct segments corresponding to subsequent human development stages. The extended linear phase starts from 35 40 years old and is associated with the exponential increase of mortality risks according to the Gompertz mortality law. We characterized the distance traveled along the aging trajectory as a natural measure of biological age and demonstrated its significant association with frailty and hazardous lifestyles, along with the remaining lifespan and healthspan of an individual. The biological age explained most of the variance of the log-hazard ratio that was obtained by fitting directly to mortality and the incidence of chronic diseases. Our findings highlight the intimate relationship between the supervised and unsupervised signatures of the biological age and frailty, a consequence of the low intrinsic dimensionality of the aging dynamics.",

We exploit a suite of genomic resources to show that introgressive hybridization occurred between close relatives of Arabidopsis, impacting our understanding of species relationships in the group. The composition of introgressed and retained genes indicates that selection against incompatible cytonuclear and nuclear-nuclear interactions likely acted during introgression, while neutral processes also contributed to genome composition through the retention of ancient haplotype blocks. We also developed a divergence-based test to distinguish donor from recipient lineages without the requirement of additional taxon-sampling. Finally, to our great surprise, we find that cytonuclear discordance appears to have arisen via extensive nuclear, rather than cytoplasmic, introgression, meaning that most of the genome was displaced during introgression, while only a small proportion of native alleles were retained.",

We assessed the influence of P. falciparum on the blood-feeding behaviour of three of its major vectors (Anopheles coluzzii, An. gambiae and An. arabiensis) in Burkina Faso. Host preference assays using odour-baited traps revealed no effect of infection on mosquito long-range anthropophily. However, the identification of the blood meal origin of mosquitoes showed that females carrying sporozoites, the mature transmissible stage of the parasite, displayed a 24% increase in anthropophagy compared to both females harbouring oocysts, the parasite immature stage, and uninfected individuals. Using a mathematical model, we further showed that this increased anthropophagy in infectious females resulted in a > 250% increase in parasite transmission potential, everything else being equal. This important epidemiological consequence highlights the importance of vector control tools targeting infectious females.",

This study investigated patterns of recurrence after pancreatic surgery.\\n\\nMethodsRecurrence patterns were described in a series of resected pancreas cancers over a 2-year period and recurrence risk expressed as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (C.I.). Survival was displayed by Kaplan-Meier curves.\\n\\nResultsOf 107 pancreas resections, 69 (65%) had pancreatic cancer. R0 resection was achieved in 21 of 69 (30.4%). Analysis was based on 66 patients who survived 30 days after surgery with median follow up 21 months. Recurrence developed in 41 (62.1%) patients with median time to first recurrence of 13.3 months (interquartile range 6.9, 20.8 months). Recurrence site was most frequently locoregional (n=28, 42%), followed by liver (n=23, 35%), lymph nodes (n=21, 32%), and lungs (n=13, 19%). In patients with recurrence, 9 of 41 had single site recurrence; the remaining 32 patients had more than one site of recurrence. Locoregional recurrence was associated with R+ resection (53% vs 25% for R+ vs R0, respectively; OR 3.5, 95% C.I. 1.1-11.2; P=0.034). Venous invasion was associated with overall recurrence risk (OR 3.3, 95% C.I. 1.1-9.4; P=0.025).

    "abstract": "Most QTL mapping approaches seek to identify \\\"mean QTL\\\", genetic loci that influence the phenotype mean, after assuming that all individuals in the mapping population have equal residual variance. Recent work has broadened the scope of QTL mapping to identify genetic loci that influence phenotype variance, termed \\\"variance QTL\\\", or some combination of mean and variance, which we term \\\"mean-variance QTL\\\". Even these approaches, however, fail to address situations where some other factor, be it an environmental factor or a distant genetic locus, influences phenotype variance. We term this situation \\\"background variance heterogeneity\\\" (BVH) and used simulation to explore its effects on the power and false positive rate of tests for mean QTL, variance QTL, and mean-variance QTL. Specifically, we compared traditional tests, linear regression for mean QTL and Levenes test for variance QTL, with tests more recently developed, namely Caos tests for all three types of QTL, and tests based on the double generalized linear model (DGLM), which, unlike the other approaches, explicitly models BVH. Simulations showed that, when used in conjunction with a permutation procedure, the DGLM-based tests accurately control false positive rate and are more powerful than the other tests. We also discovered that the rank-based inverse normal transform, often used to corral unruly phenotypes, can be used to mitigate the adverse effects of BVH in some circumstances. We applied the DGLM approach, which we term \\\"mean-variance QTL mapping\\\", to publicly available data on a mouse backcross of CAST/Ei into M16i and, after accommodating BVH driven by father, identified a new mean QTL for bodyweight at three weeks of age.",

    "abstract": "Microsatellites are common in most species. While an adaptive role for these highly mutable regions has been considered, little is known concerning their contribution towards phenotypic variation. We used populations of the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus) at two latitudes to quantify the effect of microsatellite allele length on phenotype at the level of gene expression. We conducted a common garden experiment with seed collected from sunflower populations in Kansas and Oklahoma followed by an RNA-Seq experiment on 95 individuals. The effect of microsatellite allele length on gene expression was assessed across 3325 microsatellites that could be consistently scored. Our study revealed 479 microsatellites at which allele length significantly correlates with gene expression (eSTRs). When irregular allele sizes not conforming to the motif length were removed, the number of eSTRs rose to 2379. The percentage of variation in gene expression explained by eSTRs ranged from 1-86% when controlling for population and allele-by-population interaction effects at the 479 eSTRs. Of these, 70.4% are in untranslated regions (UTRs). A Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that eSTRs are significantly enriched for GO terms associated with cis- and trans-regulatory processes. These findings suggest that a substantial number of transcribed microsatellites can influence gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Because lipid bilayers can bend and stretch in ways similar to thin elastic sheets, physical models of bilayer deformation have utilized mechanical constants such as the moduli for bending rigidity ({kappa}C) and area compressibility (KA). However, the use of these models to quantify the energetics of membrane deformation associated with protein-membrane interactions and the membrane response to stress is often hampered by the shortage of experimental data suitable for the estimation of the mechanical constants of various lipid mixtures. While computational tools such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations can provide alternative means to estimate KA values, current approaches suffer significant technical limitations. Here, we present a novel computational framework that allows for a direct estimation of KA values for individual bilayer leaflets. The theory is based on the concept of elasticity and derives KA from real-space analysis of local thickness fluctuations sampled in MD simulations. We explore and validate the model on a large set of single and multicomponent bilayers of different lipid composition and sizes, simulated at different temperatures. The calculated bilayer compressibility moduli agree with values estimated previously from experiments and those obtained from a standard computational method based on a series of constrained tension simulations. We further validate our framework in a comparison with an existing polymer brush model (PBM) and confirm the PBMs predicted linear relationship with proportionality coefficient of 24 using elastic parameters calculated from the simulation trajectories. The robustness of the results that emerge from the new method allows us to revisit the origins of the bilayer mechanical (compressible) thickness and in particular, its dependence on acyl chain unsaturation and the presence of cholesterol.",

Early in mitosis, adherent cells partially detach from the substratum, round up and their surface area decreases. This likely results from an endocytic uptake of plasma membrane material. As cells enter cytokinesis they re-adhere, flatten and exhibit an associated increase in surface area. The identity of the membrane donor for this phase of mitosis remains unclear. Here we show by biochemical and imaging approaches that lysosomes undergo exocytosis at telophase and that this requires the activity of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase-III{beta}.

Only two species have estimates substantially over 100, consistent with approximate panmixia, namely Helicobacter pylori and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Both species are far from demographic equilibrium, with diversity predicted to increase more than 30 fold in V. parahaemolyticus if the current value of Ner were maintained, to values much higher than found in any species.

    "abstract": "Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) is a basic, versatile and ubiquitous cellular signal controlling a wide variety of biological processes. A remarkable example is the steering of sea urchin spermatozoa towards the conspecific egg by a spatially and temporally orchestrated series of cytosolic [Ca2+]i spikes. Although this process has been an experimental paradigm for reproduction and sperm chemotaxis studies, the composition and regulation of the signalling network underlying the cytosolic calcium fluctuations are hitherto not fully understood. Here, we used a differential equations model of the signalling network to assess which set of channels can explain the characteristic envelop and temporal organisation of the [Ca2+]i-spike trains. The signalling network comprises an initial membrane hyperpolarisation/repolarisation produced by an upstream module triggered by the egg-released chemoattractant peptide, via receptor activation, cGMP synthesis and decay. Followed by downstream modules leading to pHi, voltage and [Ca2+]i fluctuations. The upstream module outputs were fitted to kinetic data on cGMP activity and early membrane potential changes measured in bulk cell populations. Two candidate modules featuring voltage-dependent Ca2+-channels link these outputs to the downstream dynamics and can independently explain the typical decaying envelop and the progressive spacing of the spikes. In the first module, [Ca2+]i-spike trains require the concerted action of a classical CaV-like channel and a potassium channel, BK (Slo1), whereas the second module relies on pHi-dependent, [Ca2+]i-inactivated CatSper dynamics alone. The model predicts that these two modules interfere with each other and produce unreasonable dynamics when present at similar proportions, which suggests that one may predominate over the other in vivo. To assess these alternatives, several quantitative predictions were derived from each module and confronted to experimental observations. We show that the [Ca2+]I dynamics observed experimentally after sustained alkalinisation can be reproduced by a model featuring the CatSper module but not by one including the pH-independent CaV and BK module. We conclude in favour of the module containing CatSper.",

However the underlying mechanisms and functional consequences are poorly defined. Here, we identify extensive transcriptome-3end-alterations in neuroblastoma, a tumour entity with a paucity of recurrent somatic mutations and an unusually high frequency of spontaneous regression. Utilising extensive RNAi-screening we reveal the landscape and drivers of transcriptome-3end-diversification, discovering PCF11 as critical regulator, directing alternative polyadenylation (APA) of hundreds of transcripts including a differentiation RNA-operon. PCF11 shapes inputs converging on WNT-signalling, and governs cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis and neurodifferentiation. Postnatal PCF11 down-regulation induces a neurodifferentiation program, and low-level PCF11 in neuroblastoma associates with favourable outcome and spontaneous tumour regression. Our findings document a critical role for APA in tumourigenesis and describe a novel mechanism for cell fate reprogramming in neuroblastoma with important clinical implications.

    "abstract": "Anxiety results in sub-optimal motor performance and learning; yet, the precise mechanisms through which these modifications occur remain unknown. Using a reward-based motor sequence learning paradigm, we show that concurrent and prior anxiety states impair learning by biasing estimates about the hidden performance goal and the stability of such estimates over time (volatility). In an electroencephalography study, three groups of participants completed our motor task, which had separate phases for motor exploration (baseline) and reward-based learning. Anxiety was manipulated either during the initial baseline exploration phase or while learning. We show that anxiety induced at baseline reduced motor variability, undermining subsequent reward-based learning. Mechanistically, however, the most direct consequence of state anxiety was an underestimation of the hidden performance goal and a higher tendency to believe that the goal was unstable over time. Further, anxiety decreased uncertainty about volatility, which attenuated the update of beliefs about this quantity. Changes in the amplitude and burst distribution of sensorimotor and prefrontal beta oscillations were observed at baseline, which were primarily explained by the anxiety induction. These changes extended to the subsequent learning phase, where phasic increases in beta power and in the rate of long (> 500 ms) oscillation bursts following reward feedback were linked to smaller updates in predictions about volatility, with a higher anxiety-related increase explaining the biased volatility estimates. These data suggest that state anxiety alters the dynamics of beta oscillations during general performance, yet more prominently during reward processing, thereby impairing proper updating of motor predictions when learning in unstable environments.",

In this work we employed super-resolution microscopy to reveal the nanometric-scale organization of VPs formed during rotavirus infection, and quantitatively describe the structural organization of seven viral proteins and viral dsRNA within and around the VPs. The observed viral components are spatially organized as 6 concentric layers, in which NSP5 localizes at the center of the VPs, surrounded by a layer of NSP2 and NSP4 proteins, followed by an intermediate zone comprised of the VP1, VP2, VP6 proteins and the dsRNA. In the outermost zone, we observed a ring of VP4 and finally a layer of VP7. These findings show that rotavirus VPs are highly organized organelles.",

The structural integrity of eukaryotic cells under small deformations has been known to depend on the cytoskeleton including actin filaments (F-actin), microtubules and intermediate filaments (IFs). However, it remains unclear how cells resist severe deformations since both F-actin and microtubules fluidize or disassemble under moderate strains. Here, we demonstrate that vimentin intermediate filaments (VIFs), a marker of mesenchymal cells, dominate cytoplasmic mechanics at large deformations. Our results show that cytoskeletal VIFs form a stretchable, hyperelastic network. This network works synergistically with other dissipative cytoplasmic components, substantially enhancing the strength, stretchability, resilience and toughness of the living cytoplasm.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient deposition can modify plant growth rates and potentially alter the susceptibility of plants to disturbance events, while also influencing properties of disturbance regimes. In mixed tree-grass ecosystems, such as savannas and tropical dry forests, tree seedling growth rates strongly influence the ability of seedlings to survive fire (i.e. post-fire seedling survival), and hence, vegetation structure and tree community composition. However the effects of nutrient deposition on the susceptibility of recruiting trees to fire are poorly quantified. In a field experiment, seedlings of multiple N-fixing and non-N-fixing tropical dry forest tree species were exposed to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilisation, and fire. We quantified nutrient-mediated changes in a) mean seedling growth rates; b) growth rates of the fastest growing individuals and c) post-fire seedling survival. N-fixers had substantially higher baseline post-fire seedling survival, that was unaffected by nutrient addition. Fertilisation, especially with N, increased post-fire survival probabilities in non-N-fixers by increasing the growth rates of the fastest growing individuals. These results suggest that fertilisation can lead to an increase in the relative abundance of non-N-fixers in the resprout community, and thereby, alter the community composition of tropical savanna and dry forest tree communities in the long-term.",

Most large schizophrenia genetic studies have studied people of primarily European ancestry, potentially missing important biological insights. Here we present a study of East Asian participants (22,778 schizophrenia cases and 35,362 controls), identifying 21 genome-wide significant schizophrenia associations in 19 genetic loci. Over the genome, the common genetic variants that confer risk for schizophrenia have highly similar effects in those of East Asian and European ancestry (rg=0.98), indicating for the first time that the genetic basis of schizophrenia and its biology are broadly shared across these world populations. A fixed-effect meta-analysis including individuals from East Asian and European ancestries revealed 208 genome-wide significant schizophrenia associations in 176 genetic loci (53 novel). Trans-ancestry fine-mapping more precisely isolated schizophrenia causal alleles in 70% of these loci. Despite consistent genetic effects across populations, polygenic risk models trained in one population have reduced performance in the other, highlighting the importance of including all major ancestral groups with sufficient sample size to ensure the findings have maximum relevance for all populations.",

    "abstract": "In virtually all eukaryotes, telomerase counteracts chromosome erosion by adding repetitive sequence to terminal ends. Drosophila melanogaster instead relies on specialized retrotransposons that insert preferentially at telomeres. This exchange of goods between host and mobile element--wherein the mobile element provides an essential genome service and the host provides a hospitable niche for mobile element propagation--has been called a  genomic symbiosis. However, these telomere-specialized,  jockey family elements may actually evolve to selfishly over-replicate in the genomes that they ostensibly serve. Under this intra-genomic conflict model, we expect rapid diversification of telomere-specialized retrotransposon lineages and possibly, the breakdown of this tenuous relationship. Here we report data consistent with both predictions. Searching the raw reads of the 15-million-year-old  melanogaster species group, we generated de novo jockey retrotransposon consensus sequences and used phylogenetic tree-building to delineate four distinct telomere-associated lineages. Recurrent gains, losses, and replacements account for this striking retrotransposon lineage diversity. Moreover, an ancestrally telomere-specialized element has  escaped, residing now throughout the genome of D. rhopaloa. In D. biarmipes, telomere-specialized elements have disappeared completely. De novo assembly of long-reads and cytogenetics confirmed this species-specific collapse of retrotransposon-dependent telomere elongation. Instead, telomere-restricted satellite DNA and DNA transposon fragments occupy its terminal ends. We infer that D. biarmipes relies instead on a recombination-based mechanism conserved from yeast to flies to humans. Combined with previous reports of adaptive evolution at host proteins that regulate telomere length, telomere-associated retrotransposon diversification and disappearance offer compelling evidence that intra-genomic conflict shapes Drosophila telomere evolution.",

    "abstract": "Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is a viral arthropod-borne disease affecting wild and domestic ruminants. EHD virus (EHDV) is transmitted to vertebrate animal hosts by biting midges in the genus Culicoides. Culicoides sonorensis Latreille is the only confirmed vector of EHDV in the United States but is considered rare in Florida and not sufficiently abundant to support EHDV transmission. This study used ecological niche modeling to map the potential geographical distributions and associated ecological variable space of four Culicoides species suspected of transmitting EHDV in Florida, including Culicoides insignis, Culicoides stellifer, Culicoides debilipalpis and Culicoides venustus. Models were developed with the Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Production in DesktopGARP v1.1.3 using species occurrence data from field sampling along with environmental variables from WorldClim and Trypanosomiasis and Land use in Africa. For three Culicoides species (C. insignis, C. stellifer and C. debilipalpis) 96 - 98% of the presence points were predicted across the Florida landscape (63.77% - 72.53%). For C. venustus, models predicted 98.00% of presence points across 27.42% of Florida. Geographic variations were detected between species. Culicoides insignis was predicted to be restricted to peninsular Florida, and in contrast, C. venustus was predicted to be primarily in north Florida and the panhandle region. Culicoides stellifer and C. debilipalpis were predicted nearly statewide. Environmental conditions also differed by species, with some species ranges predicted by more narrow ranges of variables than others. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was a major predictor of C. venustus and C. insignis presence. For C. stellifer, Land Surface Temperature, Middle Infrared were the most limiting predictors of presence. The limiting variables for C. debilipalpis were NDVI Bi-Annual Amplitude and NDVI Annual Amplitude at 22.45% and 28.09%, respectively. The model outputs, including maps and environmental variable range predictions generated from these experiments provide an important first pass at predicting species of veterinary importance in Florida. Because EHDV cannot exist in the environment without the vector, model outputs can be used to estimate the potential risk of disease for animal hosts across Florida. Results also provide distribution and habitat information useful for integrated pest management practices.",

However, an animal model to illustrate this clinical phenomenon has not been established. We therefore set out to investigate whether sevoflurane, a commonly used anesthetic, could alter locomotion in the mice during the induction and recovery of anesthesia. The activity of mouse was recorded 5 minutes before, during (for 30 minutes) and 40 minutes after the administration of anesthetic sevoflurane [1-, 1.5- and 2-fold minimum alveolar concentration] at 37{degrees} C. The total walking distance and velocity of movement were measured and quantified as the indexes of locomotion. We found that the anesthetic sevoflurane increased the locomotion of the mice during the induction of the anesthesia. During the recovery phase after anesthesia, the mice exhibited increased locomotion for a short period of time (about 5 minutes) and then displayed a sharp decrease in mobility for up to 60 minutes following the end of anesthesia administration. The anesthetic sevoflurane did not significantly alter the food intake and body weight of the mice. Furthermore, we found that Alzheimer s disease transgenic mice exhibited a greater sevoflurane-induced hyperactivity than the wild-type mice did. Our results showed that inhalation of the anesthetic sevoflurane induced an acute hyperactivity in mice, particularly among Alzheimer s disease transgenic mice. These findings from the pilot studies established an animal model to promote further studies into postoperative emergence agitation, hyperactivity and the underlying mechanisms of these conditions.",

    "abstract": "Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of neonatal invasive disease worldwide. In the Netherlands, the incidence of the disease increased, despite the introduction of prevention guidelines in 1999. This was accompanied by changes in pathogen genotype distribution, with a significant increase in the prevalence of isolates belonging to clonal complex (CC) 17. To better understand the mechanisms of temporal changes in the epidemiology of GBS genotypes that correlated with the rise in disease incidence, we applied whole genome sequencing (WGS) to study a national collection of invasive GBS isolates. A total of 1345 isolates from patients aged 0 - 89 days and collected between 1987 and 2016 in the Netherlands were sequenced and characterised. The GBS population contained 5 major lineages representing CC17 (39%), CC19 (25%), CC23 (18%), CC10 (9%), and CC1 (7%). There was a significant rise in the prevalence of isolates representing CC17 and CC23 among cases of early-and late-onset disease, due to expansion of discrete sub-lineages. The most prominent was shown by a CC17 sub-lineage, identified here as CC17-1A, which experienced a major clonal expansion at the end of the 1990s. The CC17-1A expansion correlated with the emergence of a novel phage carrying a gene encoding a putative adhesion protein, named here StrP. The first occurrence of this phage (designated phiStag1) within the collection in 1997, was followed by multiple, independent acquisitions by CC17 and parallel clonal expansions of CC17-1A and another cluster, CC17-1B. The CC17-1A clone was identified in external datasets, and represents a globally distributed invasive sub-lineage of CC17. Our work describes how a sudden change in the epidemiology of specific GBS sub-lineages, in particular CC17-1A, correlates with the rise in the disease incidence, and indicates a putative key role of a novel phage in driving the expansion of this CC17 clone.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGroup B Streptococcus (GBS) is a commensal organism of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. However, it is also an opportunistic pathogen and a major cause of neonatal invasive disease, which can be classified into early-onset (0 - 6 days of life) or late-onset (7 - 89 days of life). Current disease prevention strategy involves intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), which aims to prevent the transmission of GBS from mother to baby during labour. Many developed countries adapted national IAP guidelines. In the Netherlands, these were introduced in 1999. However, the incidence of GBS disease increased after IAP introduction. In this study we applied whole genome sequencing to characterise a nationwide collection of invasive GBS from cases of neonatal disease that occurred between 1987 and 2016. Analysis of GBS population structure involving phylogenetic partitioning of individual lineages revealed that the rise in disease incidence involved the expansion of specific clusters from two major GBS lineages, CC17 and CC23. Our study provides new insights into the recent evolution of the  hypervirulent CC17 and describes a rapid expansion of a discrete, pre-existing sub-lineage that occurred after acquisition of a novel phage carrying a putative adhesion protein gene, underscoring the major role of CC17 in neonatal diseases.",

DWMI is due to maturation arrest in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Using integrated genome-wide approaches in a validated mouse perinatal model of DWMI, induced by systemic- and neuro-inflammation based on repeated interleukin-1B administrations, we show that neuroinflammation induces limited epigenomic disturbances in OPCs. In contrast, we unravel marked transcriptomic alterations of genes of the immune/inflammatory pathways, which are expressed in unstressed OPCs and physiologically downregulated along OPC maturation. Consistently, we observe that transcription factors of the inflammatory pathways occupy DNA both in unstressed and inflamed OPCs. Thus, rather than altering genome-wide chromatin accessibility, neuroinflammation takes advantage of open chromatin regions and deeply counteracts the stage-dependent downregulation of these active transcriptional programs. Therefore, our study opens new avenues for the future development of targeted approaches to protect preterm brains.\n\nHighlights{circ} Limited epigenomic impact of inflammation on OPC maturation blockade\n{circ}Major transcriptomic disturbances take advantage of a primed epigenetic landscape\n{circ}Proinflammatory genes are active in OPCs and downregulated upon maturation\n{circ}Neuroinflammation counteracts both this downregulation and maturation in OPCs",

Fungal disease can impact barley production, as it causes substantial yield loss and lowers seed quality. We used sequential window acquisition of all theoretical ions mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) to measure and quantify the relative abundance of proteins within seeds of different barley varieties under various fungal pathogen burdens. Fungal burden in the leaves and stems of barley resulted in changes to the seed proteome. However, these changes were minimal and showed substantial variation among barley samples infected with different pathogens. The limited effect of intrinsic disease resistance on the seed proteome is consistent with the main mediators of disease resistance being present in the leaves and stems of the plant. The seeds of barley varieties accredited for use as malt had higher levels of proteins associated with starch synthesis and beer quality. The proteomic workflows developed and implemented here have potential application in quality control, breeding and processing of barley, and other agricultural products.",

    "abstract": "Despite existing reports on differential DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, our understanding of the functional relevance of the phenomenon remains limited. Because obesity is the main risk factor for T2D and a driver of methylation from previous study, we aimed to explore the effect of DNA methylation in the early phases of T2D pathology while accounting for body mass index (BMI). We performed a blood-based epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of fasting glucose and insulin among 4,808 non-diabetic European individuals and replicated the findings in an independent sample consisting of 11,750 non-diabetic subjects. We integrated blood-based in silico cross-omics databases comprising genomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics collected by BIOS project of the Biobanking and BioMolecular resources Research Infrastructure of the Netherlands (BBMRI-NL), the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC), the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) consortium, and the tissue-specific Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We identified and replicated nine novel differentially methylated sites in whole blood (P-value < 1.27 x 10-7): sites in LETM1, RBM20, IRS2, MAN2A2 genes and 1q25.3 region were associated with fasting insulin; sites in FCRL6, SLAMF1, APOBEC3H genes and 15q26.1 region were associated with fasting glucose. The association between SLAMF1, APOBEC3H and 15q26.1 methylation sites and glucose emerged only when accounted for BMI. Follow-up in silico cross-omics analyses indicate that the cis-acting meQTLs near SLAMF1 and SLAMF1 expression are involved in glucose level regulation. Moreover, our data suggest that differential methylation in FCRL6 may affect glucose level and the risk of T2D by regulating FCLR6 expression in the liver. In conclusion, the present study provided nine new DNA methylation sites associated with glycemia homeostasis and also provided new insights of glycemia related loci into the genetics, epigenetics and transcriptomics pathways based on the integration of cross-omics data in silico.",

    "abstract": "Due to their intimate physical interactions with the environment, surface polysaccharides are critical determinants of fitness for bacteria. Caulobacter crescentus produces a specialized structure at one of its cell poles called the holdfast that enables attachment to surfaces. Previous studies have shown that the holdfast is a carbohydrate-based material and identified a number of genes required for holdfast development. However, incomplete information about its chemical structure, biosynthetic genes and regulatory principles has limited progress in understanding the mechanism of holdfast synthesis. We have leveraged the adhesive properties of the holdfast to perform a saturating screen for genes affecting attachment to cheesecloth over a multi-day time course. Using similarities in the temporal profiles of mutants in a transposon library, we defined discrete clusters of genes with related effects on cheesecloth colonization. Holdfast synthesis, flagellar motility, type IV pilus assembly and smooth lipopolysaccharide (SLPS) production represented key classes of adhesion determinants. Examining these clusters in detail allowed us to predict and experimentally define the functions of multiple uncharacterized genes in both the holdfast and SLPS pathways. In addition, we showed that the pilus and flagellum control holdfast synthesis separately by modulating the holdfast inhibitor hfiA. This study defines a set of genes contributing to adhesion that includes newly discovered genes required for holdfast biosynthesis and attachment. Our data provide evidence that the holdfast contains a complex polysaccharide with at least four monosaccharides in the repeating unit and underscore the central role of cell polarity in mediating attachment of C. crescentus to surfaces.\\n\\nImportanceBacteria routinely encounter biotic and abiotic materials in their surrounding environments, and they often enlist specific behavioral programs to colonize these materials. Adhesion is an early step in colonizing a surface. Caulobacter crescentus produces a structure called the holdfast, which allows this organism to attach to and colonize surfaces. To understand how the holdfast is produced, we performed a genome-wide search for genes that contribute to adhesion by selecting for mutants that could not attach to cheesecloth. We discovered complex interactions between genes that mediate surface contact and genes that contribute to holdfast development. Our genetic selection identified what likely represents a comprehensive set of genes required to generate a holdfast, laying the groundwork for a detailed characterization of the enzymes that build this specialized adhesin.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. Disease presentation varies greatly in terms of cause, development, severity, and response to medication, and thus the condition has been subdivided into a number of asthma phenotypes. There is still an unmet need for the identification of phenotype-specific markers and accompanying molecular tools that facilitate the classification of asthma phenotype. To this end, we utilised a range of molecular tools to characterise a well-defined group of adults with poorly controlled asthma associated with house dust mite (HDM) allergy, relative to non-asthmatic control subjects. Circulating messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) were sequenced and quantified, and a differential expression analysis of the two RNA populations performed to determine how gene expression and regulation varied in the disease state. Further, a number of circulating proteins (IL-4, 5, 10, 17A, Eotaxin, GM-CSF, IFNy, MCP-1, TARC, TNFa, Total IgE, and Endotoxin) were quantified to determine whether the protein profiles differed significantly dependent on disease state. Finally, assessment of the circulating \\\"blood microbiome\\\" was performed using 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing. Asthmatic subjects displayed a range of significant alterations to circulating gene expression and regulation, relative to healthy control subjects, that may influence systemic immune activity. Notably, several circulating mRNAs were detected in the plasma in a condition-specific manner, and many more were found to be expressed at altered levels. Proteomic analysis revealed increased levels of inflammatory proteins within the serum, and decreased levels of the bacterial endotoxin protein in the asthma state. Comparison of blood microbiome composition revealed a significant increase in the Firmicutes phylum with asthma that was associated with a concomitant reduction in the Proteobacteria phylum. This study provides a valuable insight into the systemic changes evident in the HDM-associated asthma, identifies a range of molecules that are present in the circulation in a condition-specific manner (with clear biomarker potential), and highlights a range of hypotheses for further study.",

    "abstract": "While scanning our environment, the retinal image changes with every saccade. Nevertheless, the visual system anticipates where an attended target will be next and attention is updated to the new location. Recently, two different types of perisaccadic attentional updates were discovered: Predictive remapping of attention before saccade onset (Rolfs, Jonikaitis, Deubel, & Cavanagh, 2011) as well as lingering of attention after saccade (Golomb, Chun, & Mazer, 2008; Golomb, Pulido, Albrecht, Chun, & Mazer, 2010). We here propose a neurocomputational model located in LIP based on a previous model of perisaccadic space perception (Ziesche & Hamker, 2011, 2014). Our model can account for both types of updating of attention at a neural systems level. The lingering effect originates from the late updating of the proprioceptive eye position signal and the remapping from the early corollary discharge signal. We put these results in relationship to predictive remapping of receptive fields and show that both phenomena arise from the same simple, recurrent neural circuit. Thus, together with the previously published results, the model provides a comprehensive framework to discuss multiple experimental observations that occur around saccades.",

The magnitude of aquatic to terrestrial subsidies is well documented, but the drivers behind these subsidies and their utilization by terrestrial consumers are characteristically local scale studies, limiting the inferences that can be drawn for broader geographic scales. We therefore built and analyzed a database of stable isotope data extracted from 21 studies worldwide, to identify both landscape and local scale variables that may affect the diet of terrestrial predators in riparian ecosystems. Our meta-analysis revealed a greater magnitude of aquatic-to-terrestrial subsidies (> 50%) than previously reported, albeit with large geographic and inter-annual variations. We demonstrated a large effect of landscape-scale factors on aquatic-to-terrestrial subsidies, particularly anthropogenic land use and tree cover. Local human population was the only relevant factor at the local scale. We also found that studies on landscape-scale and anthropogenic land use effects on aquatic-to-terrestrial subsidies are currently strongly under-represented in the ecological literature. Such studies are needed to improve our understanding of how land use and environmental change might influence future patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem function.",

    "abstract": "T cell receptor (TCR) phosphorylation by Lck is an essential step in T cell activation. It is known the conformational states of Lck control enzymatic activity; however, the underlying principles of how Lck finds its substrate in the plasma membrane remain elusive. Here, single-particle tracking is paired with photoactivatable localization microscopy (sptPALM) to observe the diffusive modes of Lck in the plasma membrane. Individual Lck molecules switched between free and confined diffusion in resting and stimulated T cells. Conformational state, but not partitioning into membrane domains, caused Lck confinement as open conformation Lck was more confined than closed. Further confinement of kinase-dead versions of Lck suggests that Lck interacts with open active Lck to cause confinement, irrespectively of kinase activity. Our data supports a model that confined diffusion of open Lck results in high local phosphorylation rates and closed Lck diffuses freely to enable wide-range scanning of the plasma membrane.",

    "abstract": "Oligonucleotides and nucleic acid analogues that alter gene expression are showing therapeutic promise for selected human diseases. The modification of synthetic nucleic acids to protect against nuclease degradation and to influence drug function is common practice, however, such modifications may also confer unexpected physicochemical and biological properties. Here we report backbone-specific effects of modified oligonucleotides on subnuclear organelles, altered distribution of nuclear proteins, the appearance of novel structured nuclear inclusions, and modification of RNA processing in cultured cells transfected with antisense oligonucleotides on a phosphorothioate backbone. Phosphodiester and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers elicited no such consequences. Disruption of subnuclear structures and proteins elicit severe phenotypic disturbances, revealed by transcriptomic analysis of fibroblasts exhibiting such disruption. These data suggest that the toxic effects and adverse events reported after clinical evaluation of phosphorothioate nucleic acid drugs may be mediated, at least in part, by non-specific interaction of nuclear components with the phosphorothioate backbone.",

    "abstract": "1.The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis has long been used as a host for production and secretion of industrially relevant enzymes like amylases and proteases. It is imperative for optimal efficiency, to balance protein yield and correct folding. Gene copy numbers are an important tuning valve for the optimization of heterologous gene expression. While some genes are best expressed from many gene copies, for other genes, medium or even single copy numbers are the only way to avoid formation of inclusion bodies, toxic gene dosage effects or achieve desired levels for metabolic engineering. In order to provide a simple and robust method to address above-mentioned issues in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, we have developed an automatable system for the tuning of heterologous gene expression based on the hosts intrinsic natural competence and homologous recombination capabilities. By supplying our reporter strains with a linearized, low copy number plasmid containing homology regions left and right of the reporter genes and an antibiotic resistance marker, we could show an up to 3.6-fold higher gfp (green fluorescent protein) expression and up to 1.3-fold higher mPLC (mature phospholipase C) expression after successful recombination and thus circularization of our plasmid. Furthermore, the plasmid-borne gfp expression seems to be more stable, since over the whole cultivation period the share of fluorescent cells compared to all measured cells is consistently higher.",

    "abstract": "The eye is an intricate organ with limited representation in large-scale functional genomics datasets. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) serves vital roles in ocular development and retinal homeostasis. We interrogated the genetics of gene expression of cultured human fetal RPE (fRPE) cells under two metabolic conditions. Genes with disproportionately high fRPE expression are enriched for genes related to inherited ocular diseases. Variants near these fRPE-selective genes explain a larger fraction of risk for both age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and myopia than variants near genes enriched in 53 other human tissues. Increased mitochondrial oxidation of glutamine by fRPE promoted expression of lipid synthesis genes implicated in AMD. Expression and splice quantitative trait loci (e/sQTL) analysis revealed shared and metabolic condition-specific loci of each type and several eQTL not previously described in any tissue. Fine mapping of fRPE e/sQTL across AMD and myopia genome-wide association data suggests new candidate genes, and mechanisms by which the same common variant of RDH5 contributes to both increased AMD risk and decreased myopia risk. Our study highlights the unique transcriptomic characteristics of fRPE and provides a resource to connect e/sQTL in a critical ocular cell type to monogenic and complex eye disorders.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Asiatic wild dog or dhole (Cuon alpinus) is a highly elusive, monophyletic, forest dwelling, social canid distributed across south and Southeast Asia. Severe pressures from habitat loss, prey depletion, disease, human persecution and interspecific competition resulted in global population decline in dholes. Despite a declining population trend, detailed information on population size, ecology, demography and genetics is lacking. Generating reliable information and landscape level for dholes is challenging due to their secretive behaviour and monomorphic physical features. Recent advances in non-invasive DNA-based tools can be used to monitor populations and individuals across large landscapes. In this paper, we describe standardization and validation of faecal DNA-based methods for individual identification of dholes. We tested this method on field-collected dhole faeces in four tiger reserves of the central Indian landscape in the state of Maharashtra, India. Further, we conducted preliminary analyses of dhole population structure and demography in the study area.\\n\\nResultsWe tested a total of 18 cross-species markers and developed a panel of 12 markers for unambiguous individual identification of dholes. This marker panel identified 101 unique individuals from faecal samples collected across our pilot field study area. These loci showed varied level of amplification success (57-88%), polymorphism (3-9 alleles), heterozygosity (0.23-0.63) and produced a cumulative probability of identity (unbiased) and probability of identity (sibs) value of 4.7x10-10 and 1.5x10-4, respectively. Our preliminary analyses of population structure indicated four genetic subpopulations in dholes. Qualitative analyses of population demography show signal of population decline.\\n\\nConclusionOur results demonstrated that the selected panel of 12 microsatellite loci can conclusively identify dholes from poor quality, non-invasive biological samples and help in exploring various population parameters. Our methods can be used to estimate dhole populations and assess population trends for this elusive, social carnivore.",

    "abstract": "Asynchrony is a critical cue informing the brain whether sensory signals are caused by a common source and should be integrated or segregated. It is unclear how the brain binds audiotactile signals into behavioural benefits depending on their asynchrony. Participants actively responded (psychophysics) or passively attended (electroencephalogrpahy) to noise bursts,  taps-to-the-face, and their audiotactile (AT) combinations at seven audiotactile asynchronies: 0, {+/-}20, {+/-}70, and {+/-}500ms. Observers were faster at detecting AT than unisensory stimuli, maximally for synchronous stimulation and declining within a [&le;]70ms temporal integration window. We observed AT interactions for (1) near-synchronous stimuli within a [&le;]20ms temporal integration window for evoked response potentials (ERPs) at 110ms and [~]400ms, (2) specifically {+/-}70ms asynchronies, across the P200 ERP and theta-band inter-trial coherence (ITC) and power at [~]200ms, with a frontocentral topography, and (3) beta-band power across several asynchronies. Our results suggest that early AT interactions for ERP and theta-band ITC and power mediate behavioural response facilitation within a [&le;]70ms temporal integration window, but beta-band power reflects AT interactions that are less relevant for behaviour. This diversity of temporal profiles and constraints demonstrates how audiotactile integration unfolds in a cascade of interactions to generate behavioural benefits.",

Honorary authorship is the inclusion of authors who do not meet the criteria established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) authorship guidelines. The inclusion of honorary authors in the medical literature has led to an increase of the number of authors on studies and a decrease in single author studies in various fields.\\n\\nMethodsOur primary objective was to assess authorship trends in two major pulmonology journals (selected on the basis of Google Scholar rankings): Thorax and American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. We reviewed all articles published in both journals in the years 1994, 2004, and 2014 using Web of Science and extracted data such as number of authors and gender of the first and last authors.\\n\\nResultsThe total number of authors steadily increased from 1994 to 2014. The median number of authors grew from about four in 1994 to nearly seven in 2014, which is approximately a 75% increase. When we compiled all the data, we found the percentage of female authors from both journals had increased from 17% to 29.9% during the study period.\\n\\nDiscussionWe found an increase in the average number of authors on pulmonology publications between 1994 and 2014 as well as an increase in the number of females with a lead or main author position. This may be due to a variety of factors, such as increased team science. However, our data in conjunction with data from other areas of medicine, indicate that honorary authorship may be contributing to the trends we identified.",

The C. elegans germline plays regulatory roles not only in reproduction, but also in metabolism, stress response and aging. Previous studies have used mutants of rrf-1, which encodes an RNA-directed RNA polymerase, as a germline-specific RNAi tool. However, the rrf-1 mutants showed RNAi efficiency in somatic tissues. Here we constructed a germline-specific RNAi strain by combining an indel mutation of rde-1, which encodes an Argonaute protein that functions cell autonomously to ensure RNAi efficiency, and a single-copy rde-1 transgene driven by the sun-1 germlinespecific promoter. The germline RNAi efficiency and specificity are confirmed by RNAi phenocopy of known mutations, knockdown of GFP reporter expression, as well as quantitative RT-PCR measurement of tissue-specific mRNAs upon RNAi knockdown. The germline-specific RNAi strain shows no obvious deficiencies in reproduction, lipid accumulation, thermo-tolerance and life span compared to wild-type animals. By screening an RNAi sub-library of phosphatase genes, we identified novel regulators of thermo-tolerance. Together, we have created a useful tool that can facilitate the genetic analysis of germline-specific functions in C. elegans.",

However, there is limited information about the mechanism of genome delivery of phages that infect Gram-positive bacteria. Here we present the structures of S. aureus phage P68 in its native form, genome ejection intermediate, and empty particle. The P68 head contains seventy-two subunits of inner core protein, fifteen of which bind to and alter the structure of adjacent major capsid proteins and thus specify attachment sites for head fibers. Unlike in the previously studied phages, the head fibers of P68 enable its virion to position itself at the cell surface for genome delivery. P68 genome ejection is triggered by disruption of the interaction of one of the portal protein subunits with phage DNA. The inner core proteins are released together with the DNA and enable the translocation of phage genome across the bacterial membrane into the cytoplasm.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a mathematical model describing the potential buildup of high oxytocin concentrations in the maternal circulation during labor in terms of continuous Pitocin infusion rate, half-life and maternal weight. Oxytocin override of the degradation of oxytocin by placental oxytocinase is introduced to model the potential transfer of oxytocin from the maternal circulation across the placenta into the fetal circulation, and from there into the brain of the fetus. The desensitization unit D equal to 1.8E6 (pg-min)/ml is employed to establish a desensitization threshold, and by extension; a down-regulation threshold as a function of oxytocin override concentration and continuous Pitocin infusion time, that could be a factor in the subsequent development of autism among offspring. Epidemiological studies by Duke University (S.G. Gregory, 2013), Yale University (O. Weisman, 2015) and Harvard University (A.S. Oberg, 2016) are discussed regarding Pitocin use and offspring autism development for an explanation of the weak correlations they identified. The findings of the Harvard epidemiological study are re-interpreted regarding Pitocin use, and its conclusion questioned. Further evaluations of the findings of these three epidemiological studies are called for to incorporate medical information on quantity of Pitocin used, continuous Pitocin infusion rate, length of labor and maternal weight to determine if a correlation can be established with offspring autism development above an empirically determined desensitization threshold for Pitocin use. Suggestions for research are discussed, including an alternative to continuous Pitocin infusion, pulsatile infusion of Pitocin during labor induction, that may mitigate possible offspring autism development.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIBuildup of oxytocin (OT) in the maternal circulation mathematically modeled.\\nC_LIO_LIRelationship of OT half-life and OT concentration in maternal circulation identified.\\nC_LIO_LIOTR Desensitization related to Pitocin infusion time and OT override concentration.\\nC_LIO_LIWeak correlations for autism development in epidemiological studies explained.\\nC_LIO_LIExamination called for of medical records of Pitocin use in epidemiological studies.\\nC_LI\\n\\nOUTLINE OF PAPERIntroduction\\n\\nO_LIDevelopment and application of mathematical model - Sections 1 through 6, notably: Figures 1 through 4\\nC_LIO_LIDiscussion of oxytocin receptor desensitization as it pertains to mathematical model - Sections 7 and 8\\nC_LIO_LIInfluence of mathematical model on interpretation of epidemiological studies - Sections 9 and 10\\nC_LIO_LIResearch considerations - Section 11, notably:Subsection 11.1 - Call for detailed epidemiological analysis of selected medical information indicated by mathematical model Subsection 11.2 - Review of pulsatile Pitocin infusion to mitigate possible offspring autism development indicated by mathematical model\\nC_LI\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=145 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/446997_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (62K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1704563org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1db729aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@41035eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@442b1f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO Percent Oxytocin Removal by Liver and Kidneys and Percent Oxytocin Remaining in Blood with One-Minute Circulation Time as a Function of Oxytocin Half-Life in the Blood.\\n\\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has been successfully applied to neuroimaging data due to its larger sensitivity compared to univariate traditional techniques. Searchlight is the most widely employed approach to assign functional value to different regions of the brain. However, its performance depends on the size of the sphere, which can overestimate the region of activation when a large sphere size is employed\\n\\nIn the current study, we examined the validity of two different alternatives to Searchlight: an atlas-based local averaging method (ABLA, Schrouff et al., 2013a) and a Multi-Kernel Learning (MKL, Rakotomamonjy et al., 2008) approach, in a scenario where the goal is to find the informative brain regions that support certain mental operations. These methods employ weights to measure the informativeness of a brain region and highly reduce the large computational cost that Searchlight entails. We evaluated their performance in two different scenarios where the differential BOLD activation between experimental conditions was large vs. small, and employed nine different atlases to assess the influence of diverse brain parcellations.\\n\\nResults show that both methods were able to localize informative regions when differences between conditions were large, demonstrating a large sensitivity and stability in the identification of regions across atlases. Moreover, the sign of the weights reported by these methods provided the directionality of univariate approaches. However, when differences were small, only ABLA localized informative regions. Thus, our results show that atlas-based methods are useful alternatives to Searchlight, but that the nature of the classification to perform should be taken into account when choosing the specific method to implement.",

    "abstract": "Proteomics data analysis strongly benefits from not studying single proteins in isolation but taking their multivariate interdependence into account. We introduce PerseusNet, the new Perseus network module for the biological analysis of proteomics data. Proteomics is commonly used to generate networks, e.g. with affinity purification experiments, but networks are also used to explore proteomics data. PerseusNet supports the biomedical researcher for both modes of data analysis with a multitude of activities. For affinity purification, a volcano plot-based statistical analysis method for network generation is featured which is scalable to large numbers of baits. For posttranslational modifications of proteins, such as phosphorylation, a collection of dedicated network analysis tools helps elucidating cellular signaling events. Co-expression network analysis of proteomics data adopts established tools from transcriptome co-expression analysis. PerseusNet is extensible through a plug-in architecture in a multi-lingual way, integrating analyses in C#, Python and R and is freely available at http://www.perseus-framework.org.",

    "abstract": "Social norms can promote cooperation in human societies by assigning reputations to individuals based on their past actions. A good reputation indicates that an individual is worthy of help and is likely to reciprocate. A large body of research has established the norms of moral assessment that promote cooperation and maximize social welfare, assuming reputations are objective. But if there is no centralized institution to provide objective moral evaluation, then opinions about an individuals reputation may differ across a population. Here we use evolutionary game theory to study the effects of empathy - the capacity to make moral evaluations from the perspective of another person. We find that empathetic moral evaluation tends to foster cooperation by reducing the rate of unjustified defection. The norms of moral evaluation previously considered most socially beneficial depend on high levels of empathy, whereas different norms are required to maximize social welfare in populations unwilling or incapable of empathy. We demonstrate that empathy itself can evolve through social contagion and attain evolutionary stability under most social norms. We conclude that a capacity for empathetic moral evaluation represents a key component to sustaining cooperation in human societies: cooperation requires getting into the mindset of others whose views differ from our own.",

Here, we made optogenetically guided recordings from L5 and L6 corticothalamic (CT) neurons in the mouse auditory cortex to discern underlying patterns of functional connectivity and sensory processing in the largest sub-cerebral projection system. Whereas L5 CT neurons showed broad stimulus selectivity with sluggish response latencies and extended temporal non-linearities, L6 CTs exhibited sparse sound feature selectivity and rapid temporal processing. L5 CT spikes lagged behind neighboring units and imposed weak feedforward excitation within the local column. By contrast, L6 CT spikes drove robust and sustained activity in neighboring units. Our findings underscore a duality among CT projection neurons, where L5 CT units are canonical broadcast neurons that integrate sensory inputs for transmission to distributed downstream targets, while L6 CT neurons are positioned to regulate thalamocortical response gain and selectivity.",

Using intermodulation (IM) components as a measure of non-linear signal integration, we show in three different experiments that both expectation and attention enhance integration between top-down and bottom-up signals. Based on multispectral phase coherence, we present two direct physiological measures to demonstrate the distinct yet related mechanisms of expectation and attention. Specifically, our results link expectation to the modulation of prediction signals and the integration of top-down and bottom-up information at lower levels of the visual hierarchy. Meanwhile, they link attention to the propagation of ascending signals and the integration of information at higher levels of the visual hierarchy.

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms discriminating between regenerative failure and success remain elusive. While a regeneration-competent peripheral nerve injury mounts a regenerative gene expression response in bipolar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons, a regeneration-incompetent central spinal cord injury does not. This dichotomic response offers a unique opportunity to investigate the fundamental biological mechanisms underpinning regenerative ability. Following a pharmacological screen with small molecule inhibitors targeting key epigenetic enzymes in DRG neurons we identified HDAC3 signalling as a novel candidate brake to axonal regenerative growth. In vivo, we determined that only a regenerative peripheral but not a central spinal injury induces an increase in calcium, which activates protein phosphatase 4 that in turn dephosphorylates HDAC3 thus impairing its activity and enhancing histone acetylation. Bioinformatics analysis of ex vivo H3K9ac ChIPseq and RNAseq from DRG followed by promoter acetylation and protein expression studies implicated HDAC3 in the regulation of multiple regenerative pathways. Finally, genetic or pharmacological HDAC3 inhibition overcame regenerative failure of sensory axons following spinal cord injury. Together, these data indicate that PP4-dependent HDAC3 dephosphorylation discriminates between axonal regeneration and regenerative failure.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=122 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/446963_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (40K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bd577corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ba990aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@195813corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57abc7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical AbstractFollowing central nervous system (CNS) spinal injury, protein phosphatase 4/2 activity is not induced since calcium levels remain unchanged compared to uninjured conditions.

    "abstract": "Social transmission of information is a key phenomenon in the evolution of behavior and in the establishment of traditions and culture. The diversity of social learning phenomena has engendered a diverse terminology and numerous ideas about underlying learning mechanisms, at the same time that some researchers have called for a unitary analysis of social learning in terms of associative processes. Leveraging previous attempts and a recent computational formulation of associative learning, we analyze the following learning scenarios in some generality: learning responses to social stimuli, including learning to imitate; learning responses to non-social stimuli; learning sequences of actions; learning to avoid danger. We conceptualize social learning as situations in which stimuli that arise from other individuals have an important role in learning. This role is supported by genetic predispositions that either cause responses to social stimuli or enable social stimuli to reinforce specific responses. Our explorations show that, when guided by such predispositions, associative processes can give rise to a wide variety of social learning phenomena, such as stimulus and local enhancement, contextual imitation and simple production imitation, observational conditioning, and social and response facilitation. In addition, we clarify how associative mechanisms can result in transfer of information and behavior from experienced to naive individuals.",

A handful of genetic variants have been reported to associate with hand preference or quantitative measures related to it. Most of these reports were on the basis of limited sample sizes, by current standards for genetic analysis of complex traits. Here we performed a genome-wide association analysis of hand preference in the large, population-based UK Biobank cohort (N=331,037). We used gene-set enrichment analysis to investigate whether genes involved in visceral asymmetry are particularly relevant to hand preference, following one previous report. We found no evidence implicating any specific candidate variants previously reported. We also found no evidence that genes involved in visceral laterality play a role in hand preference. It remains possible that some of the previously reported genes or pathways are relevant to hand preference as assessed in other ways, or else are relevant within specific disorder populations. However, some or all of the earlier findings are likely to be false positives, and none of them appear relevant to hand preference as defined categorically in the general population. Within the UK Biobank itself, a significant association implicates the gene MAP2 in handedness.",

NIR-II LSM enabled non-invasive in vivo imaging of live mice, revealing never-before-seen dynamic processes such as highly abnormal tumor microcirculation, and 3D molecular imaging of an important immune checkpoint protein, programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) receptors at the single cell scale in tumors. In vivo two-color near-infrared light sheet sectioning enabled simultaneous volumetric imaging of tumor vasculatures and PD-L1 proteins in live mammals.",

    "abstract": "Animals readily execute learned motor behaviors in a consistent manner over long periods of time, yet similarly stable neural correlates remained elusive up to now. How does the cortex achieve this stable control? Using the sensorimotor system as a model of cortical processing, we investigated the hypothesis that the dynamics of neural latent activity, which capture the dominant co-variation patterns within the neural population, are preserved across time. We recorded from populations of neurons in premotor, primary motor, and somatosensory cortices for up to two years as monkeys performed a reaching task. Intriguingly, despite steady turnover in the recorded neurons, the low-dimensional latent dynamics remained stable. Such stability allowed reliable decoding of behavioral features for the entire timespan, while fixed decoders based on the recorded neural activity degraded substantially. We posit that latent cortical dynamics within the manifold are the fundamental and stable building blocks underlying consistent behavioral execution.",

    "abstract": "Patterns of amino acid covariation in large protein sequence alignments can inform the prediction of de novo protein structures, binding interfaces, and mutational effects. While algorithms that detect these so-called evolutionary couplings between residues have proven useful for practical applications, less is known about how and why these methods perform so well, and what insights into biological processes can be gained from their application. Evolutionary coupling algorithms are commonly benchmarked by comparison to true structural contacts derived from solved protein structures. However, the methods used to determine true structural contacts are not standardized and different definitions of structural contacts may have important consequences for interpreting the results from evolutionary coupling analyses and understanding their overall utility. Here, we show that evolutionary coupling analyses are significantly more likely to identify structural contacts between side-chain atoms than between backbone atoms. We use both simulations and empirical analyses to highlight that purely backbone-based definitions of true residue-residue contacts (i.e., based on the distance between C atoms) may underestimate the accuracy of evolutionary coupling algorithms by as much as 40% and that a commonly used reference point (C{beta} atoms) underestimates the accuracy by 10-15%. These findings show that co-evolutionary outcomes differ according to which atoms participate in residue-residue interactions and suggest that accounting for different interaction types may lead to further improvements to contact-prediction methods.\\n\\nSignificance StatementEvolutionary couplings between residues within a protein can provide valuable information about protein structures, protein-protein interactions, and the mutability of individual residues. However, the mechanistic factors that determine whether two residues will co-evolve remains unknown. We show that structural proximity by itself is not sufficient for co-evolution to occur between residues. Rather, evolutionary couplings between residues are specifically governed by interactions between side-chain atoms. By contrast, intramolecular contacts between atoms in the protein backbone display only a weak signature of evolutionary coupling. These findings highlight that different types of stabilizing contacts exist within protein structures and that these types have a differential impact on the evolution of protein structures that should be considered in co-evolutionary applications.",

To reveal the robustness of meiocyte differentiation and progression through meiosis, we have here established a live cell imaging setup to follow the dynamics of individual male meiocytes in Arabidopsis. Our method is based on the concomitant visualization of microtubules and a meiotic cohesion subunit that allowed following five cellular parameters: cell shape, nucleus position, nucleolus position, chromatin condensation and microtubule array. We find that the states of these parameters are not randomly associated and identify 11 states, referred to as landmarks, that occur much more frequently than closely related states, indicating that they are convergent points of meiotic progression. With this, the here-presented landmark system represents a novel method to analyze meiosis not only allowing a high-temporal dissection but also providing new criteria to evaluate mutants or environmental effects on meiosis.",

Phenomenological models are derived from the knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie the behaviour of the system under study, while empirical models are derived from analysis of data to quantify relationships between variables of interest. For studying biological systems, the phenomenological modeling approach offers the great advantage of having a structure with variables and parameters with physical meaning that enhance the interpretability of the model and its further used for decision making. The interpretability property of models, however, remains a vague concept. In this study, we tackled the interpretability property for parameters of phenomenological-based models. To our knowledge, this property has not been deeply discussed, perhaps by the implicit assumption that interpretability is inherent to the phenomenological-based models. We propose a conceptual framework to address the parameter interpretability and its implications for parameter identifiability.

Sepsis-associated AKI is a heterogeneous clinical entity, and, like many complex syndromes, is composed of distinct subtypes.

Ten vital signs and 691 unique laboratory results were identified. After data processing and feature selection, 59 features, of which 28 were measures of intra-patient variability, remained for inclusion into an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm. We utilized k-means clustering with k ranging from 2 - 10; k=2 had the highest silhouette score (0.62). Cluster 1 had 1,358 patients while Cluster 2 had 507 patients. There were no significant differences between clusters on age, race or gender. We found significant differences in comorbidities and small but significant differences in several laboratory variables (hematocrit, bicarbonate, albumin) and vital signs (systolic blood pressure and heart rate). In-hospital mortality was higher in cluster 2 patients, 25% vs. 20%, p=0.008. Features with the largest differences between clusters included variability in basophil and eosinophil counts, alanine aminotransferase levels and creatine kinase values.\\n\\nConclusionsUtilizing routinely collected laboratory variables and vital signs in the EHR, we were able to identify two distinct subphenotypes of sepsis-associated AKI with different outcomes. Variability in laboratory variables, as opposed to their actual value, was more important for determination of subphenotypes.

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed non-skin cancer and a leading cause of mortality among males in developed countries. However, our understanding of the global changes of protein complexes within PCa tissue specimens remains very limited, although it has been well recognized that protein complexes carry out essentially all major processes in living organisms and that their deregulation drives the pathogenesis and progression of various diseases. By coupling tandem mass tagging-synchronous precursor selection-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (TMT-SPSMS3) with differential expression and co-regulation analyses, the present study compared the differences between protein complexes in normal prostate, low-grade PCa, and high-grade PCa tissue specimens. Globally, a large downregulated putative protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was detected in both low-grade and high-grade PCa, yet a large upregulated putative PPI network was only detected in high-grade but not low-grade PCa, compared with normal controls. To identify specific protein complexes that are deregulated in PCa, quantified proteins were mapped to protein complexes in CORUM, a collection of experimentally verified mammalian protein complexes. Differential expression analysis suggested that mitochondrial ribosomes and the fibrillin-associated protein complex were significantly overexpressed, whereas the ITGA6-ITGB4-Laminin10/12 and the P2X7 receptor signaling complexes were significantly downregulated, in PCa compared with normal prostate. Moreover, differential co-regulation analysis indicated that the assembly levels of some nuclear protein complexes involved in RNA synthesis and processing were significantly increased in low-grade PCa, and those of mitochondrial complex I and its subcomplexes were significantly increased in high-grade PCa, compared with normal prostate. In summary, the study represents the first global and quantitative comparison of protein complexes in prostate tissue specimens. It is expected to enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PCa development and progression in human patients, as well as lead to the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for precision management of PCa.",

Results showed that there was a trade-off in performance such that vigorous genotypes, higher biomass at zero mM NaCl, had both a larger absolute decrease and proportional decrease in biomass due to increased salinity. Contrary to expectation, genotypes with a low increase in leaf Na+ and Na+:K+ were no better at maintaining biomass with increasing salinity. Rather, genotypes with a greater reduction in leaf S and K+ content were better at maintaining biomass in the face of increasing salinity. While we found a trade-off between vigour and tolerance, some genotypes were more tolerant than expected. Further analysis of the traits underlying this trade-off will allow us to identify traits/mechanisms that could be bred into high vigour genotypes in order to increase their tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Study ObjectivesExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a consequence of inadequate sleep, or of a primary disorder of sleep-wake control. Population variability in prevalence of EDS and susceptibility to EDS are likely due to genetic and biological factors as well as social and environmental influences. Epigenetic modifications (such as DNA methylation-DNAm) are potential influences on a range of health outcomes. Here, we explored the association between DNAm and daytime sleepiness quantified by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).\\n\\nMethodsWe performed multi-ethnic and ethnic-specific epigenome-wide association studies for DNAm and ESS in 619 individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Replication was assessed in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). Genetic variants in genes proximal to ESS-associated DNAm were analyzed to identify methylation quantitative trait loci and followed with replication of genotype-sleepiness associations in the UK Biobank.\\n\\nResults61 methylation sites were associated with ESS (FDR [&le;] 0.1) in African Americans only, including an association in KCTD5, a gene strongly implicated in sleep. One association (cg26130090) replicated in CHS African Americans (p-value 0.0004). We identified a sleepiness-associated methylation site in the gene RAI1, a gene associated with sleep and circadian phenotypes. In a follow-up analysis, a genetic variant within RAI1 associated with both DNAm and sleepiness score. The variants association with sleepiness was replicated in the UK Biobank.\\n\\nConclusionsOur analysis identified methylation sites in multiple genes that may be implicated in EDS. These sleepiness-methylation associations were specific to African Americans. Future work is needed to identify mechanisms driving ancestry-specific methylation effects.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceExcessive daytime sleepiness is associated with negative health outcomes such as reduction in quality of life, increased workplace accidents, and cardiovascular mortality. There are race/ethnic disparities in excessive daytime sleepiness, however, the environmental and biological mechanisms for these differences are not yet understood. We performed an association analysis of DNA methylation, measured in monocytes, and daytime sleepiness within a racially diverse study population. We detected numerous DNA methylation markers associated with daytime sleepiness in African Americans, but not in European and Hispanic Americans. Future work is required to elucidate the pathways between DNA methylation, sleepiness, and related behavioral/environmental exposures.",

We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to assess microbiome structure on leaves and soils, following crop phenology every three weeks from pre-emergence through senescence for one miscanthus growing season and two consecutive switchgrass seasons.

To that end, biodiversity impact metrics should be able to report linked trends in specific anthropogenic activities and changes in biodiversity state. However, for biodiversity, it is challenging to deliver integrated information on its multiple dimensions (i.e. species richness, endemicity) and keep it practical. Here, we developed a biodiversity footprint indicator that can i) capture the status of different species groups, ii) link biodiversity impact to specific human activities, and iii) be adapted to the most applicable scale for the decision context.\\n\\nLocationCerrado Biome, Brazil\\n\\nMethodsWe illustrate this globally-applicable approach for the case of soybean expansion in the Brazilian Cerrado. Using species-specific habitat suitability models, we assessed the impact of soy expansion and other land uses over 2,000 species of amphibians, birds, mammals and plants for three time periods between 2000 and 2014.\\n\\nResultsOverall, plants suffered the greatest reduction of suitable habitat. However, among endemic and near-endemic species - which face greatest risk of global extinction from habitat conversion in the Cerrado - birds were the most affected group. While planted pastures and cropland expansion were together responsible for most of the absolute biodiversity footprint, soy expansion via direct conversion of natural vegetation had the greatest impact per unit area. The total biodiversity footprint over the period was concentrated in the southern states of Minas Gerais, Goias and Mato Grosso, but the soy footprint was proportionally higher in those northern states (such as Bahia and Piaui) which belong to the new agricultural frontier.\\n\\nMain conclusionsThe ability and flexibility of our approach to examine linkages between biodiversity loss and specific human activities has substantial potential to better characterise the pathways by which habitat loss drivers operate.",

Kat2a is a histone acetyltransferase central to promoter activity that we recently associated with stability of pluripotency networks, and identified as a genetic vulnerability in AML. Through combined chromatin profiling and single-cell transcriptomics, we demonstrate that Kat2a contributes to leukemia propagation through homogeneity of transcriptional programs and preservation of leukemia stem-like cells. Kat2a loss reduces transcriptional bursting frequency in a subset of gene promoters, generating enhanced variability of transcript levels but minimal effects on mean gene expression. Destabilization of target programs shifts cellular equilibrium out of self-renewal towards differentiation. We propose that control of transcriptional variability is central to leukemia stem-like cell propagation, and establish a paradigm exploitable in different tumors and at distinct stages of cancer evolution.",

In multiple studies, Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) using sounds associated with prior learning improved later memory, as in recalling locations where objects previously appeared. In the present experiment, we examined whether a variant of the same technique could strengthen memory for the locations of pairs of objects. Each sound was naturally connected to one object from each pair, but we hypothesized that both memories could be improved with TMR. We first asked participants to memorize each of 50 pairs of objects by associating the two objects with each other and with the sound of one of the objects (e.g., cat-meow). Next, objects were presented in unique locations on a grid. Participants learned these locations in an adaptive procedure. During an afternoon nap, 25 of the sounds were quietly presented. In memory tests given twice before and twice after the nap, participants heard the sound for each object pair and were asked to recall the name of the second object and the locations of both objects. Forgetting scores were calculated using the mean difference between pre-nap and post-nap spatial recall errors. We found less forgetting after the nap for cued compared to non-cued objects. Additionally, the extent of forgetting tended to be similar for the two members of each pair, but only for cued pairs. Results thus substantiate the potential for sounds to reactivate spatial memories during sleep and thereby improve subsequent recall performance, even for multiple objects associated with a single sound and when participants must learn a novel sound-object association.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIMemories can be improved during sleep using arbitrary sounds\\nC_LIO_LIParticipants learned a random screen location for each of 100 objects\\nC_LIO_LIObjects were learned in pairs with the characteristic sound of one of the objects\\nC_LIO_LIHalf of those sounds were presented during a nap that followed learning\\nC_LIO_LIAfter sleep, location recall was more accurate for cued than for non-cued objects\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A central issue in neuroscience is to understand how the brain builds structured representations of percepts that facilitate useful inferences about the world. Similarity between percepts is used to accomplish many everyday tasks, e.g. object identification, so is widely used to construct geometrical spaces that represent stimulus qualities, but the intrinsic validity of the geometry is not tested critically. We introduce an experimental approach to equating relative similarities by setting perceived midpoints between pairs of stimuli. Midpoint settings are used with Varignons Theorem to test the intrinsic geometry of a representation space, and its mapping to a physical space of stimuli. For perceptual color space, we demonstrate that geometrical structure depends on the mental representation used in judging similarity: an affine geometry is valid only when observers use an opponent-color mental representation. An affine geometry implies that similarity can be judged within straight lines and across parallel lines, and its neural coding could involve ratios of responses. We show that this perceptual space is invariant to changes in illumination color, providing a formal justification to generalize to all of color space, color constancy results measured for color categories. Our midpoint measurements deviate significantly from midpoints in the \\\"uniform\\\" color spaces CIELAB and CIELUV, used extensively in industry and research, so these spaces do not provide adequate metric representation of perceived colors. Our paradigm can thus test for intrinsic geometrical assumptions underlying the representation space for many perceptual modalities, and for the extrinsic perceptual geometry of the space of physical stimuli.\\n\\nSignificanceMathematical spaces based on similarity judgments are widely used to represent stimulus qualities in perception, cognition and neuroscience.

    "abstract": "Sensory maps in layer (L) 2/3 of rodent cortex lack precise functional column boundaries, and instead exhibit locally heterogeneous tuning superimposed on smooth global topography. Could this organization be a byproduct of impoverished experience in laboratory housing? We compared whisker map somatotopy in L2/3 and L4 excitatory cells of somatosensory (S1) cortex in normally housed vs. tactile-enriched mice, using GCaMP6s imaging. Normally housed mice had a dispersed, salt-and-pepper whisker map in L2/3, but L4 was more topographically precise. Enrichment (P21 to P46-71) sharpened whisker tuning and decreased, but did not abolish, local tuning heterogeneity. In L2/3, enrichment strengthened and sharpened whisker point representations, and created functional boundaries of tuning similarity and noise correlations at column edges. Thus, tactile experience drives emergence of functional columnar topography in S1, and reduces salt-and-pepper tuning heterogeneity. These changes predict improved single-trial population coding of whisker deflections within each column.",

    "abstract": "Hyaluronan (HA) is a key component of the extracellular matrix. Given the fundamental role of HA in the cancer resistance of the naked mole-rat (NMR), we undertook to explore the structural and soft matter properties of this species-specific variant, a necessary step for its development as a biomaterial. We examined HA extracted from NMR brain, lung, and skin, as well as that isolated from the medium of immortalised cells. In common with mouse HA, NMR HA forms a range of assemblies corresponding to a wide distribution of molecular weights. However, unique to the NMR, are highly folded structures, whose characteristic morphology is dependent on the tissue type. Skin HA forms tightly packed assemblies that have spring-like mechanical properties in addition to a strong affinity for water. Brain HA forms three dimensional folded structures similar to the macroscopic appearance of the gyri and sulci of the human brain. Lung HA forms an impenetrable mesh of interwoven folds in a morphology that can only be described as resembling a snowman. Unlike HA that is commercially available, NMR HA readily forms robust gels without the need for chemical cross-linking contrasting. NMR HA gels sharply transition from viscoelastic to elastic like properties upon dehydration or repeated loading. In addition, NMR HA can form ordered thin films with an underlying semi-crystalline structure. Given the role of HA in maintaining hydration in the skin it is plausible that the folded structures contribute to both the elasticity and youthfulness of NMR skin. It is also possible that such densely folded materials could present a considerable barrier to cell invasion throughout the tissues, a useful characteristic for a biomaterial.",
