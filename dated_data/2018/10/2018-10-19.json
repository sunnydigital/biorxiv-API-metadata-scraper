    "abstract": "In many studies sex related genes have been found to evolve rapidly. We therefore expect plant pollen genes to evolve faster than sporophytic genes. In addition, pollen genes are expressed as haploids which can itself facilitate rapid evolution because recessive advantageous and deleterious alleles are not masked by dominant alleles. However, this mechanism is less straightforward to apply in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. For 1 million years A.thaliana has been self-compatible, a life history switch that has caused: a reduction in pollen competition, increased homozygosity and a dilution of masking in diploid expressed, sporophytic genes. In this study we have investigated the relative strength of selection on pollen genes compared to sporophytic genes in A. thaliana. We present two major findings: 1) before becoming self-compatible positive selection was stronger on pollen genes than sporophytic genes for A. thaliana; 2) current polymorphism data indicate selection is weaker on pollen genes compared to sporophytic genes. These results indicate that since A. thaliana has become self-compatible, selection on pollen genes has become more relaxed. This has led to higher polymorphism levels and a higher build-up of deleterious mutations in pollen genes compared to sporophytic genes.",

    "abstract": "The rice XA21-mediated immune response is activated upon recognition of the RaxX peptide produced by the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The 60 residue RaxX precursor is posttranslationally modified to form a sulfated tyrosine peptide that shares sequence and functional similarity with the plant sulfated tyrosine (PSY) peptide hormones. The five kb raxX-raxSTAB gene cluster of Xoo encodes RaxX, the RaxST tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase, and the RaxA and RaxB components of a predicted type one secretion system. The identified the complete raxX-raxSTAB gene cluster is present only in Xanthomonas spp., in five distinct lineages in addition to X. oryzae. The phylogenetic distribution of the raxX-raxSTAB gene cluster is consistent with the occurrence of multiple lateral transfer events during Xanthomonas speciation. RaxX variants representing each of the five lineages, and three Xoo RaxX variants, fail to activate the XA21-mediated immune response yet retain peptide hormone activity. These RaxX variants contain a restricted set of missense mutations, consistent with the hypothesis that selection acts to maintain peptide hormone-like function. These observations are also consistent with the hypothesis that the XA21 receptor evolved specifically to recognize Xoo RaxX.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory bulb circuits are dominated by multiple inhibitory pathways that finely tune the activity of mitral and tufted cells, the principal neurons, and regulate odor discrimination. Granule cells mediate interglomerular lateral inhibition between mitral and tufted cells lateral dendrites whereas diverse subtypes of periglomerular (PG) cells mediate intraglomerular lateral inhibition between their apical dendrites. Deep short axon cells form broad intrabulbar inhibitory circuits that regulate both populations of interneurons. Little is known about the extrabulbar GABAergic circuits that control the activity of these various interneurons. We examined this question using patch-clamp recordings and optogenetics in olfactory bulb slices from transgenic mice. We show that axonal projections emanating from diverse basal forebrain GABAergic neurons densely project in all layers of the olfactory bulb. These long-range GABAergic projections provide a prominent synaptic input on granule and short axon cells in deep layers as well as on selective subtypes of PG cells. Specifically, three different subclasses of type 2 PG cells receive robust and target-specific basal forebrain inputs but have little local interactions with other PG cells. In contrast, type 1 PG cells are not innervated by basal forebrain fibers but do interact with other PG cells. Thus, attention-regulated basal forebrain inputs regulate inhibition in all layers of the olfactory bulb with a previously overlooked synaptic complexity that further defines interneuron subclasses.\n\nKey points summaryO_LIBasal forebrain long-range projections to the olfactory bulb are important for olfactory sensitivity and odor discrimination.\nC_LIO_LIUsing optogenetics, we confirm that basal forebrain afferents mediate IPSCs on granule and deep short axon cells.

To this end, we overexpressed miRNAs in different cell types and measured the mRNA decay rate under transcriptional arrest. Parameters extracted from these experiments were incorporated into a computational stochastic framework which was developed to simulate the cooperative action of miRNAs in living cells. We identified gene sets that exhibit coordinated behavior with respect to all major miRNAs, over a broad range of overexpression levels. While a small set of genes is highly sensitive to miRNA manipulations, about 180 genes are insensitive to miRNA manipulations as measured by their degree of mRNA retention. The insensitive genes are associated with the translation machinery. We conclude that the stochastic nature of miRNAs reveals an unexpected robustness of gene expression in living cells.

The property of a signal-receiving cell that determines how it responds to such signals, including the activation of cell type-specific genes, is known as its competence. Here, we show how maternal factors modify chromatin to specify initial competence in the frog Xenopus tropicalis. We identified the earliest engaged regulatory DNA sequences, and inferred from them critical activators of the zygotic genome. Of these, we showed that the pioneering activity of the maternal pluripotency factors Pou5f3 and Sox3 predefines competence for germ layer formation by extensively remodeling compacted chromatin before the onset of signaling. The remodeling includes the opening and marking of thousands of regulatory elements, extensive chromatin looping, and the co-recruitment of signal-mediating transcription factors. Our work identifies significant developmental principles that inform our understanding of how pluripotent stem cells interpret inductive signals.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive reasoning is thought to require functional interactions between whole-brain networks. Such networks rely on both cerebral hemispheres, with the corpus callosum providing cross-hemispheric communication. Here we used high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (7T fMRI), a well validated cognitive task, and brain network analyses to investigate the functional networks underlying cognitive reasoning in individuals with corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD), an anatomical abnormality that affects the corpus callosum. Participants with CCD were asked to solve cognitive reasoning problems while their brain activity was measured using fMRI. The complexity of these problems was parametrically varied by changing the complexity of relations that needed to be established between shapes within each problem matrix. Behaviorally, participants showed a typical reduction in task performance as problem complexity increased. Task-evoked neural activity was observed in brain regions known to constitute two key cognitive control systems: the fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks. Under low complexity demands, network topology and the patterns of local neural activity in the CCD group closely resembled those observed in neurotypical controls. By contrast, when asked to solve more complex problems, participants with CCD showed a reduction in neural activity and connectivity within the fronto-parietal network. These complexity-induced, as opposed to resting-state, differences in functional network activity help resolve the apparent paradox between preserved network architecture found at rest in CCD individuals, and the heterogeneous deficits they display in response to cognitive task demands [preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/312629].",

    "abstract": "The genus Mesotoga, the only described mesophilic Thermotogae lineage, is common in mesothermic anaerobic hydrocarbon-rich environments. Besides mesophily, Mesotoga displays lineage-specific phenotypes, such as no or little H2 production and dependence on sulfur-compound reduction, which may influence its ecological role. We used comparative genomics of 18 Mesotoga strains (pairwise 16S rRNA identity > 99%) and a transcriptome of M. prima to investigate how life at moderate temperatures affects phylogeography and to interrogate the genomic features of its lineage-specific metabolism. We propose that Mesotoga accomplish H2 oxidation and thiosulfate reduction using a sulfide dehydrogenase and a hydrogenase-complex and that a pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase acquired from Clostridia is responsible for oxidizing acetate. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three distinct Mesotoga lineages (89.6-99.9% average nucleotide identity [ANI] within lineages, 79.3-87.6% ANI between lineages) having different geographic distribution patterns and high levels of intra-lineage recombination but little geneflow between lineages. Including data from metagenomes, phylogeographic patterns suggest that geographical separation historically has been more important for Mesotoga than hyperthermophilic Thermotoga and we hypothesize that distribution of Mesotoga is constrained by their anaerobic lifestyle. Our data also suggest that recent anthropogenic activities and environments (e.g., wastewater treatment, oil exploration) have expanded Mesotoga habitats and dispersal capabilities.\\n\\nOriginality-Significance StatementThis study comprises one of the first whole-genome-based phylogeographic analyses of anaerobic mesophiles, and our data suggest that such microbes are more restricted by geography than are thermophiles (and mesophilic aerobes). This is likely to be a general trait for similar anaerobic organisms - and therefore broadly relevant to and testable in other environments. Moreover, Mesotoga bacteria are part of the largely understudied subsurface ecosystem that has relatively recently been recognized as a new and important biosphere. Understanding the forces responsible for the distribution of organisms in the subsurface, as well as the identification of genes responsible for Mesotogas distinct metabolism, will contribute to the understanding of these communities.",

    "abstract": "The term microbiome describes the genetic material encoding the various microbial populations that inhabit our body. Whilst colonisation of various body niches (e.g. the gut) by dynamic communities of microorganisms is now universally accepted, the existence of microbial populations in other \\\"classically sterile\\\" locations, including the blood, is a relatively new concept. The presence of bacteria-specific DNA in the blood has been reported in the literature for some time, yet the true origin of this is still the subject of much deliberation. The aim of this study was to investigate the phenomenon of a \\\"blood microbiome\\\" by providing a comprehensive description of bacterially-derived nucleic acids using a range of complementary molecular and classical microbiological techniques. For this purpose we utilised a set of plasma samples from healthy subjects (n = 5) and asthmatic subjects (n = 5). DNA-level analyses involved the amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. RNA-level analyses were based upon the de novo assembly of unmapped mRNA reads and subsequent taxonomic identification. Molecular studies were complemented by viability data from classical aerobic and anaerobic microbial culture experiments. At the phylum level, the blood microbiome was predominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The key phyla detected were consistent irrespective of molecular method (DNA vs RNA), and consistent with the results of other published studies. In silico comparison of our data with that of the Human Microbiome Project revealed that members of the blood microbiome were most likely to have originated from the oral or skin communities. To our surprise, aerobic and anaerobic cultures were positive in eight of out the ten donor samples investigated, and we reflect upon their source. Our data provide further evidence of a core blood microbiome, and provide insight into the potential source of the bacterial DNA / RNA detected in the blood. Further, data reveal the importance of robust experimental procedures, and identify areas for future consideration.",

New optical tools, and their validation in biological tissues, are needed that can image neuromodulation with high spatial and temporal resolution, which will add an important new dimension of information to neuroscience research. Here, we demonstrate the use of a catecholamine nanosensor with fluorescent emission in the 1000-1300 nm near-infrared window to measure dopamine transmission in ex vivo brain slices. These near-infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) represent a broader class of nanosensors that can be synthesized from non-covalent conjugation of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) with single strand oligonucleotides. We show that nIRCats can be used to detect catecholamine efflux in brain tissue driven by both electrical stimulation or optogenetic stimulation. Spatial analysis of electrically-evoked signals revealed dynamic regions of interest approximately 2 microns in size in which transients scaled with simulation intensity. Optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic terminals produced similar transients, whereas optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic terminals showed no effect on nIRCat signal. Bath application of nomifensine prolonged nIRCat fluorescence signal, consistent with reuptake blockade of dopamine. We further show that the chemically synthetic molecular recognition elements of nIRCats permit measurement of dopamine dynamics in the presence of dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists. These nIRCat nanosensors may be advantageous for future use because i) they do not require virus delivery, gene delivery, or protein expression, ii) their near-infrared fluorescence facilitates imaging in optically scattering brain tissue and is compatible for use in conjunction with other optical neuroscience tool sets, iii) the broad availability of unique near-infrared colors have the potential for simultaneous detection of multiple neurochemical signals, and iv) they are compatible with pharmacology. Together, these data suggest nIRCats and other nanosensors of this class can serve as versatile new optical tools to report dynamics of extracellular neuromodulation in the brain.",

We found that knowledgebases containing clinical interpretations of somatic cancer variants are highly disparate in interpretation content, structure, and supporting primary literature, impeding consensus when evaluating variants and their relevance in a clinical setting. With the cooperation of experts of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and six prominent cancer variant knowledgebases, we developed a framework for aggregating and harmonizing variant interpretations to produce a meta-knowledgebase of 12,856 aggregate interpretations covering 3,437 unique variants in 415 genes, 357 diseases, and 791 drugs. We demonstrated large gains in overlap between resources across variants, diseases, and drugs as a result of this harmonization. We subsequently demonstrated improved matching between a patient cohort and harmonized interpretations of potential clinical significance, observing an increase from an average of 33% per individual knowledgebase to 56% in aggregate. Our analyses illuminate the need for open, interoperable sharing of variant interpretation data. We also provide an open and freely available web interface (search.cancervariants.org) for exploring the harmonized interpretations from these six knowledgebases.",

    "abstract": "O_LISpecies-specific diversification rates, or \\\"tip rates\\\", can be computed quickly from phylogenies and are widely used to study diversification rate variation in relation to geography, ecology, and phenotypes. These tip rates provide a number of theoretical and practical advantages, such as the relaxation of assumptions of rate homogeneity in trait-dependent diversification studies. However, there is substantial confusion in the literature regarding whether these metrics estimate speciation or net diversification rates. Additionally, no study has yet compared the relative performance and accuracy of tip rate metrics across simulated diversification scenarios.\\nC_LIO_LIWe compared the statistical performance of three model-free rate metrics (inverse terminal branch lengths; node density metric; DR statistic) and a model-based approach (BAMM). We applied each method to a large set of simulated phylogenies that had been generated under different diversification processes; scenarios included multi-regime time-constant and diversity-dependent trees, as well as trees where the rate of speciation evolves under a diffusion process. We summarized performance in relation to the type of rate variation, the magnitude of rate heterogeneity and rate regime size. We also compared the ability of the metrics to estimate both speciation and net diversification rates.\\nC_LIO_LIWe show decisively that model-free tip rate metrics provide a better estimate of the rate of speciation than of net diversification. Error in net diversification rate estimates increases as a function of the relative extinction rate. In contrast, error in speciation rate estimates is low and relatively insensitive to extinction. Overall, and in particular when relative extinction was high, BAMM inferred the most accurate tip rates and exhibited lower error than non-model-based approaches. DR was highly correlated with true speciation rates but exhibited high error variance, and was the best metric for very small rate regimes.\\nC_LIO_LIWe found that, of the metrics tested, DR and BAMM are the most useful metrics for studying speciation rate dynamics and trait-dependent diversification. Although BAMM was more accurate than DR overall, the two approaches have complementary strengths. Because tip rate metrics are more reliable estimators of speciation rate, we recommend that empirical studies using these metrics exercise caution when drawing biological interpretations in any situation where the distinction between speciation and net diversification is important.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "For centuries, biologists have been captivated by the vast disparity in species richness between different groups of organisms. Variation in diversity is widely attributed to differences between groups in how fast they speciate or go extinct. Such macroevolutionary rates have been estimated for thousands of groups and have been correlated with an incredible variety of organismal traits. Here we analyze a large collection of phylogenetic trees and fossil time series and report a hidden generality amongst these seemingly idiosyncratic results: speciation and extinction rates follow a scaling law where both depend strongly on the age of the group in which they are measured, with the fastest rates in the youngest clades. Using a series of simulations and sensitivity analyses, we demonstrate that the time-dependency is unlikely to be a result of simple statistical artifacts. As such, this time-scaling has profound implications for the interpretation of rate estimates and suggests there might be general laws governing macroevolutionary dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Coccidioides spp. are dimorphic, pathogenic fungi that can cause severe human and animal disease. Like the other primary fungal pathogens, animal infection results in a morphologic transformation from the environmental mycelial phase to a tissue phase, known as a spherule. The sequencing and annotation of Coccidioides spp. and the genomes of several nonpathogenic Onygenales species allows comparisons that provide clues about the Coccidioides spp. genes that might be involved in pathogenesis. The analysis in this study is a gene by gene orthology comparison. Although there were few differences in the size of genes families in the Coccidioides spp.-specific group compared to the genes shared by Coccidioides spp. and nonpathogenic Onygenales, there were a number of differences in the characterization of the two types of genes. Many more Coccidioides spp.-specific genes are up-regulated expression in spherules. Coccidioides spp.-specific genes more often lacked functional annotation and were more often classified as orphan genes. Analysis by random forest machine learning confirmed that high numbers of orthologs and high levels of expression in hyphae were predictive of common genes, while high levels of expression in spherules and more nonsynonymous predicted Coccidioides spp.-specific genes. Review of individual genes in the Coccidioides spp.-specific group identified a histidine kinase, two thioredoxin genes, a calmodulin gene and ureidoglycolate hydrolase. Hopefully, identification of these genes will be useful for pursuing potential Coccidioides spp. virulence genes in the future.",

We reviewed the literature, public databases, citizen science records, and performed in situ population surveys across the island to determine the historical and current status and distribution of psittacine species. We used count data from Ebird to determine population trends. For species whose populations were increasing, we modelled their potential distribution using niche modeling techniques. We found 46 Psittaciformes in Puerto Rico, of which 26% are only present as pets, at least 29 species have been reported in the wild, and of those, there is evidence that at least 12 species are breeding. Our results indicate that most introduced species which have been detected as established still persist, although mostly in localized areas and small populations. Clear evidence of invasiveness was found for Brotogeris versicolurus and Myiopsitta monachus, which have greatly expanded their range in recent years. Psittacara erythrogenys and Eupsittacula canicularis also showed population increases, although to a lesser degree. The niche models predicted suitable areas for the four species, and also indicate the potential for range expansion. We discuss the factors leading to invasion success, assess the potential impacts, and we discuss possible management strategies and research prospects.",

    "abstract": "Many models of classical conditioning fail to describe important phenomena, notably the rapid return of fear after extinction. To address this shortfall, evidence converged on the idea that learning agents rely on latent-state inferences, i.e. an ability to index disparate associations from cues to rewards (or penalties) and infer which index (i.e. latent state) is presently active. Our goal was to develop a model of latent-state inferences that uses latent states to predict rewards from cues efficiently and that can describe behavior in a diverse set of experiments. The resulting model combines a Rescorla-Wagner rule, for which updates to associations are proportional to prediction error, with an approximate Bayesian rule, for which beliefs in latent states are proportional to prior beliefs and an approximate likelihood based on current associations. In simulation, we demonstrate the models ability to reproduce learning effects both famously explained and not explained by the Rescorla-Wagner model, including rapid return of fear after extinction, the Hall-Pearce effect, partial reinforcement extinction effect, backwards blocking, and memory modification. Lastly, we derive our model as an online algorithm to maximum likelihood estimation, demonstrating it is an efficient approach to outcome prediction. Establishing such a framework is a key step towards quantifying normative and pathological ranges of latent-state inferences in various contexts.\\n\\nAuthor summaryComputational researchers are increasingly interested in a structured form of learning known as latent-state inferences. Latent-state inferences is a type of learning that involves categorizing, generalizing, and recalling disparate associations between observations in ones environment and is used in situations when the correct association is latent or unknown. This type of learning has been used to explain overgeneralization of a fear memory and the cognitive role of certain brain regions important to cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry. Accordingly, latent-state inferences are an important area of inquiry. Through simulation and theory, we establish a new model of latent-state inferences. Moving forward, we aim to use this framework to measure latent-state inferences in healthy and psychiatric populations.",

    "abstract": "Since the initial description of the genomic patterns expected under models of positive selection acting on standing genetic variation and on multiple beneficial mutations--so-called soft selective sweeps--researchers have sought to identify these patterns in natural population data. Indeed, over the past two years, large-scale data analyses have argued that soft sweeps are pervasive across organisms of very different effective population size and mutation rate--humans, Drosophila, and HIV. Yet, others have evaluated the relevance of these models to natural populations, as well as the identifiability of the models relative to other known population-level processes, arguing that soft sweeps are likely to be rare. Here, we look to reconcile these opposing results by carefully evaluating three recent studies and their underlying methodologies. Using population genetic theory, as well as extensive simulation, we find that all three examples are prone to extremely high false-positive rates, incorrectly identifying soft sweeps under both hard sweep and neutral models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that well-fit demographic histories combined with rare hard sweeps serve as the more parsimonious explanation. These findings represent a necessary response to the growing tendency of invoking parameter-heavy, assumption-laden models of pervasive positive selection, and neglecting best practices regarding the construction of proper demographic null models.",

    "abstract": "Pupillometry, the measure of pupil size and reactivity, has been widely used to assess cognitive processes. As such, changes in pupil size have been shown to correlate with arousal, locomotion, cortical state and decision-making processes. In addition, pupillary responses have been linked to the activity of neuromodulatory systems that modulate attention and perception as the noradrenergic and cholinergic systems. Due to the extent of processes reflected by the pupil, we aimed at resolving pupillary responses in context of behavioral state and task performance while recording pupillary transients of mice performing a vibrotactile two-alternative forced choice task (2-AFC). We show that pre-stimulus pupil size differentiates between states of disengagement from task performance versus active engagement. In addition, when actively engaged, post-stimulus, pupillary dilations for correct responses are larger than for error responses with this difference reflecting response confidence. Importantly, in a delayed 2-AFC task version, we show that even though pupillary transients mainly reflect motor output or reward anticipation following the response of the animal, they also reflect animal decision confidence prior to its response. Finally, in a condition of passive engagement, when stimulus has no task relevance with reward provided automatically, pupillary dilations reflect stimulation and reward being reduced relative to a state of active engagement explained by shifts of attention from task variables. Our results provide further evidence for how pupillary dilations reflect cognitive processes in a task relevant context, showing that the pupil reflects response confidence and baseline pupil size encodes attentiveness rather than general arousal.\\n\\nSignificance StatementFor the last 60 years, pupillometry has been used to study various cognitive processes. Among which are mental load, arousal and various decision related components, linking pupil dilations to underlying neuromodulatory systems. Our results provide extensive evidence that in addition to reflecting attentiveness under task performance, pupil dilations also reflect the confidence of the subject in his ensuing response. This confidence coding is overlaid within a more pronounced pupil dilation that reflects motor output or other post-decision components such that are related to the response itself but not to the decision. Our results also provide evidence how different behavioral states, imposed by task demands, modulate what the pupil is reflecting, presumably showing what the underlying cognitive network is coding for.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in Parkin (PARK2) are the most common genetic cause of early-onset Parkinsons disease (PD). Parkin encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated in the turnover of damaged mitochondria. Hundreds of Parkin missense variants have been reported in public databases, yet the role of most of them in PD remains unclear. We analyzed Parkin variants using clinical, experimental, and structural modeling approaches. For most variants, clinical evidence alone was insufficient to determine pathogenicity. Utilizing a cell model that allows measurement of Parkin-mediated mitophagy and Parkin stability, 51 variants were classified into five groups based on their effect on Parkin function. Most variants were like wildtype but, unexpectedly, several enhanced mitophagy. A minority destabilized Parkin or severely disrupted Parkin-mediated mitophagy, most of which were also determined as pathogenic based on clinical evidence alone. Structural simulation predicted discrete mechanisms explaining both increases and decreases in Parkin function. Interestingly, impaired mitophagy in several of the most common pathogenic Parkin variants could be rescued both by naturally-occurring (p.V224A) and structure-guided designer (p.W403A; p.F146A) hyperactive Parkin variants. These findings provide a coherent framework to classify Parkin variants based on pathogenicity and suggest that several pathogenic Parkin variants represent promising targets for genotype-specific drug design.",

    "abstract": "AATF is a central regulator of the cellular outcome upon p53 activation, a finding that has primarily been attributed to its function as a transcription factor. Recent data showed that AATF is essential for ribosome biogenesis and plays a role in rRNA maturation. AATF has been implicated to fulfil this role through direct interaction with rRNA and was identified in several RNA-interactome capture experiments. Here, we provide a first comprehensive analysis of the RNA bound by AATF using CLIP-sequencing. Interestingly, this approach shows predominant binding of the 45S pre-ribosomal RNA precursor molecules. Furthermore, AATF binds to mRNAs encoding for ribosome biogenesis factors as well as snoRNAs. These findings are complemented by an in-depth analysis of the protein interactome of AATF containing a large set of proteins known to play a role in rRNA maturation with an emphasis on the protein-RNA-complexes known to be required for the generation of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU). In line with this finding, the binding sites of AATF within the 45S rRNA precursor localize in close proximity to the SSU cleavage sites. Consequently, our multilayer analysis of the protein-RNA interactome of AATF reveals this protein to be an important hub for protein and RNA interactions involved in ribosome biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Habitat fragmentation is threatening global biodiversity. To date, there is only limited understanding of how habitat fragmentation or any alteration to the spatial structure of a landscape in general, affects species diversity within complex ecological networks such as food webs. Here, we present a dynamic and spatially-explicit food web model which integrates complex food web dynamics at the local scale and species-specific dispersal dynamics at the landscape scale, allowing us to study the interplay of local and spatial processes in metacommunities. We explore how habitat fragmentation, defined as a decrease of habitat availability and an increase of habitat isolation, affects the species diversity patterns of complex food webs (-, {beta}-,{gamma} -diversity), and specifically test whether there is a trophic dependency in the effect of habitat fragmentation on species diversity. In our model, habitat isolation is the main driver causing species loss and diversity decline. Our results emphasise that large-bodied consumer species at high trophic positions go extinct faster than smaller species at lower trophic levels, despite being superior dispersers that connect fragmented landscapes better. We attribute the loss of top species to a combined effect of higher biomass loss during dispersal with increasing habitat isolation in general, and the associated energy limitation in highly fragmented landscapes, preventing higher trophic levels to persist. To maintain trophic-complex and species-rich communities calls for effective conservation planning which considers the interdependence of trophic and spatial dynamics as well as the spatial context of a landscape and its energy availability.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. Disease presentation varies greatly in terms of cause, development, severity, and response to medication, and thus the condition has been subdivided into a number of asthma phenotypes. There is still an unmet need for the identification of phenotype-specific markers and accompanying molecular tools that facilitate the classification of asthma phenotype. To this end, we utilised a range of molecular tools to characterise a well-defined group of adults with poorly controlled asthma associated with house dust mite (HDM) allergy, relative to non-asthmatic control subjects. Circulating messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) were sequenced and quantified, and a differential expression analysis of the two RNA populations performed to determine how gene expression and regulation varied in the disease state. Further, a number of circulating proteins (IL-4, 5, 10, 17A, Eotaxin, GM-CSF, IFNy, MCP-1, TARC, TNFa, Total IgE, and Endotoxin) were quantified to determine whether the protein profiles differed significantly dependent on disease state. Finally, assessment of the circulating \\\"blood microbiome\\\" was performed using 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing. Asthmatic subjects displayed a range of significant alterations to circulating gene expression and regulation, relative to healthy control subjects, that may influence systemic immune activity. Notably, several circulating mRNAs were detected in the plasma in a condition-specific manner, and many more were found to be expressed at altered levels. Proteomic analysis revealed increased levels of inflammatory proteins within the serum, and decreased levels of the bacterial endotoxin protein in the asthma state. Comparison of blood microbiome composition revealed a significant increase in the Firmicutes phylum with asthma that was associated with a concomitant reduction in the Proteobacteria phylum. This study provides a valuable insight into the systemic changes evident in the HDM-associated asthma, identifies a range of molecules that are present in the circulation in a condition-specific manner (with clear biomarker potential), and highlights a range of hypotheses for further study.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a mathematical model describing the potential buildup of high oxytocin concentrations in the maternal circulation during labor in terms of continuous Pitocin infusion rate, half-life and maternal weight. Oxytocin override of the degradation of oxytocin by placental oxytocinase is introduced to model the potential transfer of oxytocin from the maternal circulation across the placenta into the fetal circulation, and from there into the brain of the fetus. The desensitization unit D equal to 1.8E6 (pg-min)/ml is employed to establish a desensitization threshold, and by extension; a down-regulation threshold as a function of oxytocin override concentration and continuous Pitocin infusion time, that could be a factor in the subsequent development of autism among offspring. Epidemiological studies by Duke University (S.G. Gregory, 2013), Yale University (O. Weisman, 2015) and Harvard University (A.S. Oberg, 2016) are discussed regarding Pitocin use and offspring autism development for an explanation of the weak correlations they identified. The findings of the Harvard epidemiological study are re-interpreted regarding Pitocin use, and its conclusion questioned. Further evaluations of the findings of these three epidemiological studies are called for to incorporate medical information on quantity of Pitocin used, continuous Pitocin infusion rate, length of labor and maternal weight to determine if a correlation can be established with offspring autism development above an empirically determined desensitization threshold for Pitocin use. Suggestions for research are discussed, including an alternative to continuous Pitocin infusion, pulsatile infusion of Pitocin during labor induction, that may mitigate possible offspring autism development.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIBuildup of oxytocin (OT) in the maternal circulation mathematically modeled.\\nC_LIO_LIRelationship of OT half-life and OT concentration in maternal circulation identified.\\nC_LIO_LIOTR Desensitization related to Pitocin infusion time and OT override concentration.\\nC_LIO_LIWeak correlations for autism development in epidemiological studies explained.\\nC_LIO_LIExamination called for of medical records of Pitocin use in epidemiological studies.\\nC_LI\\n\\nOUTLINE OF PAPERIntroduction\\n\\nO_LIDevelopment and application of mathematical model - Sections 1 through 6, notably: Figures 1 through 4\\nC_LIO_LIDiscussion of oxytocin receptor desensitization as it pertains to mathematical model - Sections 7 and 8\\nC_LIO_LIInfluence of mathematical model on interpretation of epidemiological studies - Sections 9 and 10\\nC_LIO_LIResearch considerations - Section 11, notably:Subsection 11.1 - Call for detailed epidemiological analysis of selected medical information indicated by mathematical model Subsection 11.2 - Review of pulsatile Pitocin infusion to mitigate possible offspring autism development indicated by mathematical model\\nC_LI\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=145 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/446997_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (62K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1704563org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1db729aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@41035eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@442b1f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO Percent Oxytocin Removal by Liver and Kidneys and Percent Oxytocin Remaining in Blood with One-Minute Circulation Time as a Function of Oxytocin Half-Life in the Blood.\\n\\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Membranes in cells have defined distributions of lipids in each leaflet, controlled by lipid scramblases and flip/floppases. However, for some intracellular membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum the scramblases have not been identified. Members of the TMEM16 family have either lipid scramblase and ion channel activity, or specific chloride channel activity. Although TMEM16K is widely distributed and associated with the neurological disorder autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCAR10), its location in cells, function and structure are largely uncharacterised. Here we show that TMEM16K is an ER-resident calcium-regulated lipid scramblase. Our crystal structures of TMEM16K show a scramblase fold, with an open lipid transporting groove. Additional structures solved by cryo-EM reveal extensive conformational changes extending from the cytoplasmic to the ER side of the membrane, giving a state with a closed lipid permeation pathway. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the open-groove conformation is necessary for scramblase activity. Our results suggest mechanisms by which missense variants of TMEM16K could cause SCAR10 ataxia, providing new hypotheses to explore for therapy.",

    "abstract": "Zebrafish models of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) have been studied for over a decade, but curiously, robust zebrafish B cell ALL (B-ALL) models had not been described. Recently, our laboratories reported two seemingly closely-related models of zebrafish B-ALL. In these genetic lines, the primary difference is expression of either murine or human transgenic c-MYC, each controlled by the zebrafish rag2 promoter. Here, we compare ALL gene expression in both models. Surprisingly, we find that B-ALL arise in different B cell lineages, with ighm+ vs. ighz+ B-ALL driven by murine Myc vs. human MYC, respectively. Moreover, these B-ALL types exhibit signatures of distinct molecular pathways, further unexpected dissimilarity. Thus, despite sharing analogous genetic makeup, the ALL types in each model are markedly different, proving subtle genetic changes can profoundly impact model organism phenotypes. Investigating the mechanistic differences between mouse and human c-MYC in these contexts may reveal key functional aspects governing MYC-driven oncogenesis in human malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Neuronatin (Nnat) is expressed in the pituitary, pancreas, and other tissues; however, the function of NNAT is still unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated that NNAT is localized in the sex determining region Y-box 2-positive stem/progenitor cells in the developing rat pituitary primordium and is downregulated during differentiation into mature hormone-producing cells. Moreover, NNAT is widely localized in subcellular organelles, excluding the Golgi. Here, we further evaluated NNAT expression and intracellular localization in embryonic and postnatal rat tissues such as the pancreas, tongue, whisker hair follicle, and testis. Immunohistochemistry showed that NNAT was localized in undifferentiated cells (i.e., epithelial basal cells and basement cells in the papillae of the tongue and round and elongated spermatids of the testis) as well as in differentiated cells (insulin-positive cells and exocrine cells of the pancreas, taste receptor cells of the fungiform papilla, the inner root sheath of whisker hair follicles, and spermatozoa). Additionally, NNAT showed novel intracellular localization in acrosomes in the spermatozoa. Because the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is excluded from spermatozoa and sarco/ER Ca2+-ATPase isoform 2 (SERCA2) is absent from the inner root sheath, these findings suggested that NNAT localization in the ER and its interaction with SERCA2 were cell-or tissue-specific properties.",

    "abstract": "The genetic basis of parallel ecological divergence provides important clues to the operation of natural selection and the predictability of evolution. Many examples exist where binary environmental contrasts seem to drive parallel divergence. However, this simplified view can conceal important components of parallel divergence because environmental variation is often more complex. Here, we disentangle the genetic basis of parallel divergence across two axes of environmental differentiation (crab-predation vs. wave-action and low-shore vs. high-shore habitat contrasts) in the marine snail Littorina saxatilis, a well established natural system of parallel ecological divergence. We used whole-genome resequencing across multiple instances of these two environmental axes, at local and regional scales from Spain to Sweden. Overall, sharing of genetic differentiation is generally low but it is highly heterogeneous across the genome and increases at smaller spatial scales. We identified genomic regions, both overlapping and non-overlapping with recently described candidate chromosomal inversions, that are differentially involved in adaptation to each of the environmental axis. Thus, the evolution of parallel divergence in L. saxatilis is largely determined by the joint action of geography, history, genomic architecture and congruence between environmental axes. We argue that the maintenance of standing variation, perhaps as balanced polymorphism, and/or the re-distribution of adaptive variants via gene flow can facilitate parallel divergence in multiple directions as an adaptive response to heterogeneous environments.",

Here, we used a population of A. thaliana epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) to characterize >8000 de novo insertions produced by several TEs families also active in nature. Integration was strongly biased towards genes, with evident deleterious effects. Biases were TE family-specific and associated with distinct chromatin features. Notably, we demonstrate that the histone variant H2A.Z guides the preferential integration of Ty1/Copia LTR-retrotransposons within environmentally responsive genes and that this guiding function is evolutionary conserved. Finally, we uncover an important role for epigenetic silencing in exacerbating or alleviating the effects of TE insertions on target genes. These findings establish chromatin as a major determinant of the spectrum and functional impact of TE-generated mutations, with important implications for adaptation and evolution.",

However, the relationship between the epigenetic regulation of the NR2B gene in the rat hippocampus region and EWS were inconsistent. A rat model of chronic ethanol exposure was established. EWS score and the behavioral changes were recorded at different points in time. The NR2B expression levels and the histone H3K9 acetylation level in the NR2B gene promoter region were measured using qRT-PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation, respectively. Finally, the relationships between the epigenetic modification of histone H3K9 acetylation of NR2B gene promoter and EWS were examined.

In previous work in humans, we showed that evoked responses of arousal centers during decisions are reported by rapid dilations of the pupil, and predict a suppression of biases in the accumulation of decision-relevant evidence (de Gee et al. 2017). Here, we show that this arousal-related suppression in decision bias acts on both conservative and liberal biases, and generalizes across species (humans / mice), sensory systems (visual / auditory), and domains of decision-making (perceptual / memory-based). In challenging sound-detection tasks, the impact of spontaneous or experimentally induced choice biases was reduced under high arousal. Similar bias suppression occurred when evidence was drawn from memory. All these behavioral effects were explained by reduced evidence accumulation biases. Our results pinpoint a general principle of the interplay between phasic arousal and decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Ecosystems and biodiversity produce benefits to society, but many of them are hard to quantify. For example, it is unclear whether European societies gain benefits from experiencing rivers that host high native biodiversity. Without such knowledge, monetary investments into ecologically oriented river management plans are difficult to justify. The objective of this study was to reveal how the public in four European countries values ecological characteristics of domestic rivers and the outcomes of hypothetical river basin management plans designed to improve river ecosystems, particularly fish biodiversity. We conducted a choice experiment among the populations in Norway, Sweden, Germany and France. We found similar preference structures in all countries with high marginal willingness-to-pay for improvements of abiotic river attributes (increased accessiblity of the river banks, improved bathing water quality, decreased river fragmentation). Citizens also benefited from certain fish species occurring in a river with native salmonid species being more valued than nonnatives, particularly in Norway, and from the degree of a rivers native biodiversity. Welfare measures calculated for selected river basin management plans (policy scenarios) revealed societal benefits that were primarily derived from ecological river management whereas a scenario focusing on hydroelectricity production generated the lowest utility. We conclude that ecological river management may produce high nonmarket economic benefits in all study countries, particularly through the management of abiotic river attributes and the restoration of declining or extinct fish species. Our results help to inform decisions on restoration efforts by showcasing the benefits that these measures have for the public.",

    "abstract": "Gene drives could allow for control of vector-borne diseases by directly suppressing vector populations or spreading genetic payloads designed to reduce pathogen transmission. CRISPR homing gene drives work by cleaving wild-type alleles, which are then converted to drive alleles by homology-directed repair, increasing the frequency of the drive in a population. However, resistance alleles can form when end-joining repair takes place in lieu of homology-directed repair. Such alleles cannot be converted to drive alleles, which would halt the spread of a drive through a population. To investigate the effects of natural genetic variation on resistance formation, we developed a CRISPR homing gene drive in Drosophila melanogaster and crossed it into the genetically diverse Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines, measuring several performance parameters. Most strikingly, resistance allele formation post-fertilization in the early embryo ranged from 7% to 79% among lines and averaged 42{+/-}18%. We performed a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) using our results in the DGRP lines and found that the resistance and conversion rates were polygenic, with several genetic polymorphisms showing relatively weak association. RNAi knockdown of several of these genes confirmed their effect, but their small effect sizes implies that their manipulation will yield only modest improvements to the efficacy of gene drives.",

We used a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to screen, 1,049 SZ and 30 AD variants in 64 and 9 loci respectively for allele differences in driving reporter gene expression. A library of synthetic oligonucleotides assaying each allele 5 times was transfected into K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia lymphoblasts and SK-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. 148 variants showed allelic differences in K562 and 53 in SK-SY5Y cells, on average 2.6 variants per locus. Nine showed significant differences in both lines, a modest overlap reflecting different regulatory landscapes of these lines that also differ significantly in chromatin marks. Eight of nine were in the same direction. We observe no preference for risk alleles to increase or decrease expression. We find a positive correlation between the number of SNPs in Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) and the proportion of functional SNPs supporting combinatorial effects that may lead to haplotype selection. Our results prioritize future functional follow up of disease associated SNPs to determine the driver GWAS variant(s), at each locus and enhance our understanding of gene regulation dynamics.",

NAFLD has been considerated to be associated with the composition of gut microbiota. However, causal relationship between change of gut microbiome and NAFLD remains unclear. Here we show that Klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly associated with NAFLD through inducing generation of endogenous ethanol. A strain of high alcohol-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (HiAlc Kpn) was initially isolated from fecal samples of patient with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) accompanied with auto-brewery syndrome (ABS). Gavage of HiAlc Kpn was capable of inducing murine model of fatty liver disease (FLD) in which had typical pathological changes of hepatic steatosis and similar liver gene expression profiles to those of alcohol intake in mice. Data derived from germ-free mice by gnotobiotic gavage further demonstrated that the HiAlc Kpn is the major cause of the changes in FLD mice. Furthermore, using proteomic and metabolitic analysis, we found that HiAlc Kpn induced generation of endogenous alcohol through the 2,3-butanediol fermentation pathway. More interestingly, the blood alcohol concentration was elevated in FLD mice induced by HiAlc Kpn after glucose intake. Clinical analysis showed that HiAlc Kpn were observed in up to 60% of patients with NAFLD. Our results suggested that HiAlc Kpn make important contribution to NAFLD, possibly through generation of the endogenous alcohol. Thus, targeting these bacteria might provide a novel therapeutic for clinical treatment of NAFLD.\\n\\nIn BriefFatty liver disease induced by high alcohol-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae\\n\\nCompeting Financial Interest StatementThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.",

For example, we recently reported that DA neurons in mice projecting to dorsomedial striatum are modulated by choices contralateral to the recording side. Here, we introduce, and ultimately reject, a candidate resolution for the puzzling RPE vs movement dichotomy, by showing how seemingly movement-related activity might be explained by an action-specific RPE. By considering both choice and RPE on a trial-by-trial basis, we find that DA signals are modulated by contralateral choice in a manner that is distinct from RPE, implying that choice encoding is better explained by movement direction. This fundamental separation between RPE and movement encoding may help shed light on the diversity of functions and dysfunctions of the DA system.",

These tracts are frequent in activation domains of transcription factors and their length often correlates with transcriptional activity. In addition, in nine proteins, tract elongation beyond specific thresholds causes polyQ disorders. To study the structural basis of the association between tract length, transcriptional activity and disease, here we addressed how the conformation of the polyQ tract of the androgen receptor (AR), a transcription factor associated with the polyQ disease spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), depends on its length. We found that the tract folds into a helical structure stabilized by unconventional hydrogen bonds between glutamine side chains and main chain carbonyl groups. These bonds are bifurcate with the conventional main chain to main chain hydrogen bonds stabilizing -helices. In addition, since tract elongation provides additional interactions, the helicity of the polyQ tract directly correlates with its length. These findings suggest a plausible rationale for the association between polyQ tract length and AR transcriptional activity and have implications for establishing the mechanistic basis of SBMA.",

Several authors have observed that often the same genes are involved in cancer when mutated in somatic cells and in genetic diseases when mutated in the germline. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques have provided us with large databases of both types of mutations, allowing us to investigate this issue in a systematic way. Here we show that high-throughput data about the frequency of somatic mutations in the most common cancers can be used to predict the genes involved in abnormal phenotypes and diseases. The predictive power of somatic mutation patterns is largely independent of that of methods based on germline mutation frequency, so that they can be fruitfully integrated into algorithms for the prioritization of causal variants. Our results confirm the deep relationship between pathogenic mutations in somatic and germline cells, provide new insight into the common origin of cancer and genetic diseases and can be used to improve the identification of new disease genes.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIn the past few years many novel prediction approaches have been proposed and widely employed in high dimensional genetic data for disease risk evaluation. However, those approaches typically ignore in model fitting the important group structures or functional classifications that naturally exists in genetic data.\\n\\nMethodsIn the present study, we applied a novel model averaging approach, called Jackknife Model Averaging Prediction (JMAP), for high dimensional genetic risk prediction while incorporating KEGG pathway information into the model specification. JMAP selects the optimal weights across candidate models by minimizing a cross-validation criterion in a jackknife way. Compared with previous approaches, one of the primary features of JMAP is to allow model weights to vary from 0 to 1 but without the limitation that the summation of weights is equal to one. We evaluated the performance of JMAP using extensive simulation studies and compared it with existing methods. We finally applied JMAP to five real cancer datasets that are publicly available from TCGA.\\n\\nResultsThe simulations showed that, compared with other existing approaches, JMAP performed best or are among the best methods across a range of scenarios. For example, among 14 out of 16 simulation settings with PVE=0.3, JMAP has an average of 0.075 higher prediction accuracy compared with gsslasso. We further found that in the simulation the model weights for the true candidate models have much smaller chances to be zero compared with those for the null candidate models and are substantially greater in magnitude. In the real data application, JMAP also behaves comparably or better compared with the other methods for both continuous and binary phenotypes. For example, for the COAD, CRC and PAAD data sets, the average gains of predictive accuracy of JMAP are 0.019, 0.064 and 0.052 compared with gsslasso.\\n\\nConclusionThe proposed method JMAP is a novel method that can provide more accurate phenotypic prediction while incorporating external useful group information.",

We found that activation of dopamine receptor D1 but not D2 leads to rapid dephosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr56 in cortical primary neuronal culture and in vivo in a time-dependent manner. Additionally, NMDA receptor, mTOR, and ERK pathways are upstream to the D1 receptor-dependent eEF2 dephosphorylation and essential for it. Furthermore, D1 receptor activation resulted in a major reduction in dendritic eEF2 phosphorylation levels together with a correlative increase in local mRNA translation.

Adenylate kinase (AK), that catalyzes inter-conversion of ADP, ATP and AMP, plays a major role in maintaining AEC, and is regulated by cellular AMP levels. Hence, the enzymes AMP deaminase (AMPD) and nucleotidases, which catabolize AMP, indirectly regulate AK activity and in-turn affect AEC. Here, we present the first report on AMPD from Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria. The recombinant enzyme expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied using functional complementation assay and residues vital for enzyme activity have been identified. Similarities and differences between Plasmodium falciparum AMPD (PfAMPD) and its homologs from yeast, Arabidopsis and humans are also discussed. The AMPD gene was deleted in the murine malaria parasite P. berghei and was found to be non-essential for intra-erythrocytic growth of the knockout parasites. However, when episomal expression was attempted, viable parasites were not obtained, suggesting that perturbing AMP homeostasis by over-expressing AMPD might be lethal. As AMPD is known to be allosterically modulated by ATP, GTP and phosphate, allosteric activators of PfAMPD could be developed as anti-parasitic agents.",

Nevertheless, how neo-allopolyploid genomes adapt to regulate their expression remains poorly understood. The hypothesis of a major role for small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) in mediating the transcriptional response of neo-allopolyploid genomes has progressively emerged. Generally, 21-nt sRNAs mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) by mRNA cleavage whereas 24-nt sRNAs repress transcription (transcriptional gene silencing, TGS) through epigenetic modifications. Here, we characterize the global response of sRNAs to allopolyploidy in Brassica, using three independently resynthesized B. napus allotetraploids surveyed at two different generations in comparison with their diploid progenitors. Our results suggest an immediate but transient response of specific sRNA populations to allopolyploidy. These sRNA populations mainly target non-coding components of the genome but also target the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in response to stresses and in metabolism; this suggests a broad role in adapting to allopolyploidy. We finally identify the early accumulation of both 21- and 24-nt sRNAs involved in regulating the same targets, supporting a PTGS-to-TGS shift at the first stages of the neo-allopolyploid formation. We propose that reorganization of sRNA production is an early response to allopolyploidy in order to control the transcriptional reactivation of various non-coding elements and stress-related genes, thus ensuring genome stability during the first steps of neo-allopolyploid formation.",

Here, we addressed the question by which mechanisms influenza A viruses may escape restriction by the cellular importin-7 protein, a component of the nuclear import machinery required for avian-mammalian adaptation and replicative fitness in human cells. Therefore, we assessed viral evolution in mice lacking the importin-7 gene. Here, we show that particularly three mutations occur with high frequency in the viral NP protein (G102R, M105K and D375N) in a specific structural area upon in vivo adaptation. Moreover, our findings suggest that the adaptive NP mutations mediate viral escape from importin-7 requirement likely due to the utilization of alternative interaction sites in NP beyond the classical nuclear localization signal and importin- isoforms. However, viral escape from importin-7 is, at least in part, associated with reduced replicative fitness in human cells.",

In a previous paper we have shown a role for the GARP complex in sphingolipid sorting and homeostasis (Frohlich et al. 2015). However, the majority of cargo sorted in a GARP dependent process remain largely unknown. Here we use auxin induced degradation of GARP combined with mass spectrometry based vacuolar proteomics and lipidomics to show that recycling of two specific groups of proteins, the amino-phospholipid flippases and cell wall synthesis proteins depends on a functional GARP complex. Our results suggest that mis-sorting of flippases and remodeling of the lipid composition are the first occurring defects in GARP mutants.

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk score (PRS) is the state-of-art prediction method for complex traits using summary level data from discovery genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The PRS, as its name suggests, is designed for polygenic traits by aggregating small genetic effects from a large number of causal SNPs and thus is viewed as a powerful method for predicting complex polygenic traits by the genetics community. However, one concern is that the prediction accuracy of PRS in practice remains low with little clinical utility, even for highly heritable traits. Another practical concern is whether genome-wide SNPs should be used in constructing PRS or not. To address the two concerns, we investigate PRS both empirically and theoretically. We show how the performance of PRS is influenced by the triplet (n, p, m), where n, p, m are the sample size, the number of SNPs studied, and the number of true causal SNPs, respectively. For a given heritability, we find that i) when PRS is constructed with all p SNPs (referred as GWAS-PRS), its prediction accuracy is controlled by the p/n ratio; while ii) when PRS is built with a set of top-ranked SNPs that pass a pre-specified threshold (referred as threshold-PRS), its accuracy varies depending on how sparse the true genetic signals are. Only when m is magnitude smaller than n, or genetic signals are sparse, can threshold-PRS perform well and outperform GWAS-PRS. Our results demystify the low performance of PRS in predicting highly polygenic traits, which will greatly increase researchers aware-ness of the power and limitations of PRS, and clear up some confusion on the clinical application of PRS.",

Here we analysed the pan-genome structure and the genome evolution of 25 strains of Streptococcus suis, 50 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 28 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae.\\n\\nResultsFractions of the pan-genome, unique, periphery, and universal genes differ in size, functional composition, the level of nucleotide substitutions, and predisposition to horizontal gene transfer and genomic rearrangements. The density of substitutions in intergenic regions appears to be correlated with selection acting on adjacent genes, implying that more conserved genes tend to have more conserved regulatory regions. The total pan-genome of the genus is open, but only due to strain-specific genes, whereas other pan-genome fractions reach saturation. The strain-specific fraction is enriched with mobile elements and hypothetical proteins, but also contains a number of candidate virulence-related genes, so it may have a strong impact on adaptability and pathogenicity.\\n\\nAbout 7% of single-copy periphery genes have been found in different syntenic regions. More than a half of these genes are rare in all Streptococcus species; others are rare in at least one species. We have identified the set of genes with phylogenies inconsistent with species and non-conserved location in the chromosome; these genes are candidates for horizontal transfer between species.\\n\\nAn inversion of length 15 kB found in four independent branches of S. pneumoniae has breakpoints formed by genes encoding a surface antigen protein (PhtD).

BSP30b is most closely related to the PLUNC family and is predominantly found in bovine saliva. There are four BSP30 isoforms (BSP30a-d) and collectively, they are the most abundant protein component of bovine saliva. The PLUNC family members are proposed to be lipid binding proteins, although in most cases their lipid ligands are unknown. Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure of BSP30b at 2.0 [A] resolution. We used a double methionine mutant and Se-Met SAD phasing to solve the structure. The structure adopts a curved cylindrical form with a hydrophobic channel formed by an /{beta} wrap, which is consistent with the TULIP superfamily. The structure of BSP30b in complex with oleic acid is also presented where the ligand is accommodated within the hydrophobic channel. The electron density for oleic acid suggests that the ligand is only partially occupied in the binding site implying that oleic acid may not be the preferred ligand. GFP-tagged BSP30b binds to the surface of olive oil droplets, as observed under fluorescent microscopy, and acts as a surfactant consistent with its association with decreased susceptibility to bloat in cattle. Bacteria extracted directly from bovine rumen contents indicate that the GFP_BSP30b fusion protein binds to a small number of selected bacterial species in vivo. These results suggest that BSP30b may bind to bacterial lipids from specific species and that this abundant protein may have important biological roles via interacting with rumen bacteria during feeding and rumination.",

Livestock are commonly administered antibiotics in their feed, but there is current interest in raising animals that are only administered antibiotics during active infections.

SA has achieved high levels of antibiotic resistance, but the origins and locations of resistance selection are poorly understood. We determined the prevalence of SA and MRSA in conventional and antibiotic-free (AF) meat products, and also measured rates of antibiotic resistance in these isolates. We isolated SA from raw conventional turkey, chicken, beef, and pork samples and also from AF chicken and turkey samples.

MRSA was isolated from 15.72% of conventional raw meats (range of 2.78-20.41%) but not from AF-free meats. The degree of antibiotic resistance in conventional poultry products was significantly higher vs AF poultry products for a number of different antibiotics, and while multi-drug resistant strains were relatively common in conventional meats none were detected in AF meats. The use of antibiotics in livestock contributes to high levels of antibiotic resistance in SA found in meat products.

    "abstract": "Increase in influenza A virus host range throughout its evolution has given rise to major concerns worldwide. Although the increasing host range mechanism of the virus is largely unknown; persistent genetic mutations have been blamed as a key factor in the re-organization of the host response and the host range. To uncover the underlying core bases of the two important antigenic proteins of influenza virus (HA and NA), functional data mining and image processing analysis of over 8000 protein sequences of different HA and NA subtypes were performed. Each amino acid sequence in HA or NA proteins sat as a feature or variable and two polynomial datasets were created and subjected into conventional prediction models. The average accuracies of these predictive models for HA subtype classifications ranged from 38.9% for SVM to 87.2% for Decision Tree models. NA subtype classification with conventional prediction models varied from 81.3% to 99.87% for SVM and KNN models, respectively. Then amino acid sequence datasets were converted to binary images; subtypes feature sat as target variable, and target label determined by image processing convolution neural network. The performances of Image processing models (convolutional neural network) on binary images for both HA and NA datasets reached to 100%; and the application of Gabor2 filter decreased the time for the predicting model to reach the best performance for HA subtype; while it increased the epochs time for NA subtype classification.\\n\\nFor the first time ever, converting influenza virus HA and NA amino acid sequences into the binary image datasets and their classifications by convolution neural network increased the prediction accuracies and performances to the highest possible point.

    "abstract": "Recent investigation indicated that latent reservoir and immune impairment are responsible for the post-treatment control of HIV infection. In this paper, we simplify the disease model with latent reservoir and immune impairment and perform a series of mathematical analysis. We obtain the basic infection reproductive number R0 to characterize the viral dynamics. We prove that when R0 < 1, the uninfected equilibrium of the proposed model is globally asymptotically stable. When R0 > 1, we obtain two thresholds, the post-treatment immune control threshold and the elite control threshold. The model has bistable behaviors in the interval between the two thresholds. If the proliferation rate of CTLs is less than the post-treatment immune control threshold, the model does not have positive equilibria. In this case, the immune free equilibrium is stable and the system will have virus rebound. On the other hand, when the proliferation rate of CTLs is greater than the elite control threshold, the system has stable positive immune equilibrium and unstable immune free equilibrium. Thus, the system is under elite control.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn this article, we use mathematical model to investigate the combined effect of latent reservoir and immune impairment on the post-treatment control of HIV infection. By simplifying an HIV model with latent reservoir and immune impairment, and performing mathematical analysis, we obtain the post-treatment immune control threshold and the elite control threshold for the HIV dynamics when R0 > 1. The HIV model displays bistable behaviors in the interval between the two thresholds. We illustrate our results using both mathematical analysis and numerical simulation. Our result is consistent with recent medical experiment. We show that patient with low proliferation rate of CTLs may undergo virus rebound, and patient with high proliferation rate of CTLs may obtain elite control of HIV infection. We perform bifurcation analysis to illustrate the infection status of patient with the variation of proliferation rate of CTLs, which potentially explain the reason behind different outcomes among HIV patients.",

Among the tested models, the one featuring dormancy was best able to describe the data. It predicted latency phases of 4.4 - 5.7 months and onset of BMs 14 - 19 months before diagnosis. This quantitative model paves the way for a computational tool of potential help during therapeutic management.",

    "abstract": "Experimental methods for studying an enhancement of osteoblast proliferation in vitro provide tools for the research of biochemical processes involved in bone turnover in vivo. Some of the current methods used for this purpose are based on the ability of the osteoblasts to enhance proliferation by mechanical stimulation. We describe an experimental approach of biomechanical stimulation of cultured human osteoblast-like cells by vibration. This method is based on the specially designed controlled vibration setup that consists of an electric actuator, with horizontally mounted well plate containing cell cultures. Previously this method found to be effective to enhance cell proliferation, but the exact mechanical parameters of effective vibration were elusive. The current low friction system for mechanical stimulation of osteoblast-like cells in vitro provides recording of narrow range mechanical parameters in the infrasonic spectrum.\\n\\nWe exposed human osteoblast-like cells in explant monolayer culture to mechanical vibration in the 10-70Hz range of frequencies and found that 50-70 Hz of vibration frequency is optimal for inducing osteoblast proliferation that was deduced from interrelation between unchanged cell number in culture samples with significant decrease in cell death rate (decreased LDH activity in culture media, p<.05) and with parallel decrease of their maturation level (p<.01).\\n\\nIn this report we determined the optimal mechanical parameters and excitation protocol for induction of osteoblast proliferation in vitro by using a tunable and versatile mechanical platform, which can be used in the research of cell mechanotransduction.",

    "abstract": "The reproductive parasite Wolbachia are the most common endosymbionts on earth, present in a plethora of arthropod species. They have been introduced into mosquitos to successfully prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases, yet the strategies of host cell subversion underlying their obligate intracellular lifestyle remain to be explored in depth in order to gain insights into the mechanisms of pathogen-blocking. Like some other intracellular bacteria, Wolbachia reside in a host-derived vacuole in order to replicate and escape the immune surveillance. Using here the pathogen-blocking Wolbachia strain from Drosophila melanogaster, introduced into two different Drosophila cell lines, we show that Wolbachia subvert the endoplasmic reticulum to acquire their vacuolar membrane and colonize the host cell at high density. Wolbachia redistribute the endoplasmic reticulum to increase contact sites, and time lapse experiments reveal tight coupled dynamics suggesting important signalling events or nutrient uptake. They however do not affect the tubular or cisternal morphologies. A fraction of endoplasmic reticulum becomes clustered, allowing the endosymbionts to reside in between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, possibly modulating the traffic between these two organelles. Gene expression analyses and immunostaining studies suggest that Wolbachia achieve persistent infections at very high titers without triggering endoplasmic reticulum stress or enhanced ERAD-driven proteolysis, suggesting that amino acid salvage is achieved through modulation of other signalling pathways.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWolbachia are a genus of intracellular bacteria living in symbiosis with millions of arthropod species. They have the ability to block the transmission of arboviruses when introduced into mosquito vectors, by interfering with the cellular resources exploited by these viruses. Despite the biomedical interest of this symbiosis, little is known about the mechanisms by which Wolbachia survive and replicate in the host cell. We show here that the membrane composing the Wolbachia vacuole is acquired from the endoplasmic reticulum, a central organelle required for protein and lipid synthesis, and from which originates a vesicular trafficking toward the Golgi apparatus and the secretory pathway. Wolbachia modify the distribution of this organelle to increase their interactions with this source of membrane and likely of nutrients as well. In contrast to some intracellular pathogenic bacteria, the effect of Wolbachia on the cell homeostasis does not induce a stress on the endoplasmic reticulum. One of the consequences of such a stress would be an increased proteolysis used to relieve the cell from an excess of misfolded proteins. Incidentally, this shows that Wolbachia do not acquire amino acids from the host cell through this strategy.",

    "abstract": "Research in applied ecology provides scientific evidence to guide conservation policy and management. Applied ecology is becoming increasingly quantitative and model selection via information criteria has become a common statistical modeling approach. Unfortunately, parameters that contain little to no useful information are commonly presented and interpreted as important in applied ecology. I review the concept of an uninformative parameter in model selection using information criteria and perform a literature review to measure the prevalence of uninformative parameters in model selection studies applying Akaikes Information Criterion (AIC) in 2014 in four of the top journals in applied ecology (Biological Conservation, Conservation Biology, Ecological Applications, Journal of Applied Ecology). Twenty-one percent of studies I reviewed applied AIC metrics. Many (31.5 %) of the studies applying AIC metrics in the four applied ecology journals I reviewed had or were very likely to have uninformative parameters in a model set. In addition, more than 40 % of studies reviewed had insufficient information to assess the presence or absence of uninformative parameters in a model set. Given the prevalence of studies likely to have uninformative parameters or with insufficient information to assess parameter status (71.5 %), I surmise that much of the policy recommendations based on applied ecology research may not be supported by the data analysis. I provide warning signals and a decision tree to help reduce the prevalence of uninformative parameters in studies applying model selection with information criteria. The four warning signals and decision tree should assist authors, reviewers, and editors to screen for uninformative parameters in studies applying model selection with information criteria. In the end, careful thinking at every step of the scientific process and greater reporting standards are required to detect uninformative parameters in studies adopting an information criteria approach.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFibrinogen is an essential hemostatic factor and cardiovascular disease risk factor. Early attempts at evaluating the causal effect of fibrinogen on coronary heart disease (CHD) and myocardial infraction (MI) using Mendelian randomization (MR) used single variant approaches, and did not take advantage of recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or multi-variant, pleiotropy robust MR methodologies.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe evaluated evidence for a causal effect of fibrinogen on both CHD and MI using MR. We used both an allele score approach and pleiotropy robust MR models. The allele score was composed of 38 fibrinogen-associated variants from recent GWAS. Initial analyses using the allele score incorporated data from 11 European-ancestry prospective cohorts to examine incidence CHD and MI. We also applied 2 sample MR methods with data from a prevalent CHD and MI GWAS. Results are given in terms of the hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR), depending on the study design, and associated 95% confidence interval (CI).\\n\\nIn single variant analyses no causal effect of fibrinogen on CHD or MI was observed. In multi-variant analyses using incidence CHD cases and the allele score approach, the estimated causal effect (HR) of a 1 g/L higher fibrinogen concentration was 1.62 (CI = 1.12, 2.36) when using incident cases and the allele score approach. In 2 sample MR analyses that accounted for pleiotropy, the causal estimate (OR) was reduced to 1.18 (CI = 0.98, 1.42) and 1.09 (CI = 0.89, 1.33) in the 2 most precise (smallest CI) models, out of 4 models evaluated. In the 2 sample MR analyses for MI, there was only very weak evidence of a causal effect in only 1 out of 4 models.\\n\\nConclusionsA small causal effect of fibrinogen on CHD is observed using multi-variant MR approaches which account for pleiotropy, but not single variant MR approaches. Taken together, results indicate that even with large sample sizes and multi-variant approaches MR analyses still cannot exclude the null when estimating the causal effect of fibrinogen on CHD, but that any potential causal effect is likely to be much smaller than observed in epidemiological studies.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryInitial Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses of the causal effect of fibrinogen on coronary heart disease (CHD) utilized single variants and did not take advantage of modern, multivariant approaches. This manuscript provides an important update to these initial analyses by incorporating larger sample sizes and employing multiple, modern multi-variant MR approaches to account for pleiotropy. We used incident cases to perform a MR study of the causal effect of fibrinogen on incident CHD and the nested outcome of myocardial infarction (MI) using an allele score approach. Then using data from a case-control genome-wide association study for CHD and MI we performed two sample MR analyses with multiple, pleiotropy robust approaches. Overall, the results indicated that associations between fibrinogen and CHD in observational studies are likely upwardly biased from any underlying causal effect. Single variant MR approaches show little evidence of a causal effect of fibrinogen on CHD or MI. Multi-variant MR analyses of fibrinogen on CHD indicate there may be a small positive effect, however this result needs to be interpreted carefully as the 95% confidence intervals were still consistent with a null effect. Multi-variant MR approaches did not suggest evidence of even a small causal effect of fibrinogen on MI.",

    "abstract": "Drought stress can imprint marks in plants after a previous exposure, leading to a permissive state that facilitates a more effective response to subsequent stress events. Such stress imprints would benefit plants obtained from progenitors previously exposed to drought. Herein, our hypothesis was that daughter plants obtained from mother plants previously exposed to water deficit will perform better under water deficit as compared to those obtained from mothers that did not face stressful conditions. Sugarcane mother plants were grown under well-hydrated conditions or subjected to three cycles of water deficit by water withholding. Then, daughter plants produced through vegetative propagation were subjected to water deficit. Leaf gas exchange was reduced under water deficit and daughters from mothers that experienced water deficit presented a faster recovery of CO2 assimilation and higher instantaneous carboxylation efficiency after rehydration as compared to daughters from mothers that did not face water deficit. Plants obtained from mother plants that faced water deficit showed the highest leaf proline concentration under water deficit as well as higher leaf H2O 2 concentration and leaf ascorbate peroxidase activity regardless of water regime. Under well-watered conditions, daughters from mothers that faced stressful conditions presented higher root H2O2 concentration and root catalase activity than ones from mothers that did not experience water shortage. Such physiological changes were associated with improvements in leaf area and shoot and root dry matter accumulation in daughters from stressed mothers. Our results suggest that root H2O2 concentration is a chemical signal associated with stress memory and improved sugarcane growth. Such findings bring a new perspective to sugarcane production systems, in which stress memory can be explored for improving drought tolerance in rainfed areas.",

    "abstract": "Japan is one of the few rabies-free countries/territories which implement the policy of mandatory vaccination of domestic dogs. In order to assess the economic efficiency of such policy in reducing the economic burden of a future canine rabies outbreak in Japan, a benefit-cost analysis (BCA) was performed using probabilistic decision tree modelling. Input data derived from simulation results of published mathematical model, field investigation conducted by the authors at prefectural governments, literature review, international or Japanese database and empirical data of rabies outbreaks in other countries/territories. The current study revealed that the annual costs of implementing the current vaccination policy would be US$160,472,075 (90% prediction interval [PI]: $149,268,935 - 171,669,974). The economic burden of a potential canine rabies outbreak in Japan were estimated to be US$1,682,707 (90% PI: $1,180,289 - 2,249,283) under the current vaccination policy, while it would be US$5,019,093 (90% PI: $3,986,882 - 6,133,687) under hypothetical abolition of vaccination policy, which is 3-fold higher. Under a damage-avoided approach, the annual benefits of implementing the current vaccination policy in expected value were estimated to be US$85.75 (90% PI: $55.73 - 116.89). The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) was estimated to be 5.35 x 10-7 (90% PI: 3.46 x 10-7 - 7.37 x 10-7), indicating that the implementation of the current policy is very economically inefficient for the purpose of reducing the economic burden of a potential canine rabies outbreak. In worse-case scenario analysis, the BCR would become above 1 (indicating economic efficiency) if the risk of rabies introduction increased to 0.04 corresponding to a level of risk where rabies would enter Japan in 26 years while the economic burden of a rabies outbreak under the abolition of vaccination policy increased to $7.53 billion. Best-case analysis further revealed that the economic efficiency of the current policy could be improved by decreasing the vaccination price charged to dog owners, relaxing the frequency of vaccination to every two to three years and implementing the policy on a smaller scale, e.g. only in targeted prefectures instead of the whole Japan.",

    "abstract": "Vibrios are ubiquitous in marine environments and opportunistically colonize a broad range of hosts. Strains of Vibrio tasmaniensis present in oyster farms can thrive in oysters during juvenile mortality events. Among them, V. tasmaniensis LGP32 behaves as a facultative intracellular pathogen of oyster hemocytes, a property rather unusual in vibrios. Herein, we asked whether LGP32 resistance to phagocytosis could result from coincidental selection of virulence factors during interactions with heterotrophic protists, such as amoeba, in the environment. To answer that question, we developed an integrative study, from the first description of amoeba diversity in oyster-farming areas to the characterization of LGP32 interactions with amoebae of the Vannella genus that were found abundant in the oyster environment. LGP32 was shown to be resistant to grazing by amoebae and this phenotype was dependent on previously identified virulence factors: the secreted metalloprotease Vsm and the copper efflux p-ATPase CopA. Using dedicated in vitro assays, our results showed that these virulence factors act at different steps during amoeba-vibrio interactions than they do in oysters-vibrio interactions. Hence, the virulence factors of LGP32 are key determinants of biotic interactions with multiple hosts ranging from protozoans to metazoans, suggesting that the selective pressure exerted by amoebae in marine coastal environments favor coincidental selection of virulence factors.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic flexibility promotes infection and commensal colonization by the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans. Yeast cell survival depends upon assimilation of fermentable and non-fermentable locally available carbon sources. Physiologically relevant sugars like glucose and fructose are present at low level in host niches. However, because glucose is the preferred substrate for energy and biosynthesis of structural components, its efficient metabolization is fundamental for the metabolic adaptation of the pathogen. We explored and characterized the C. albicans hexose kinase system composed of one hexokinase (CaHxk2) and two glucokinases (CaGlk1 and CaGlk4). Using a set of mutant strains, we found that hexose phosphorylation is mostly assured by CaHxk2, which sustains growth on hexoses. Our data on hexokinase and glucokinase expression point out an absence of cross regulation mechanisms at the transcription level and different regulatory pathways. In the presence of glucose, CaHxk2 migrates in the nucleus and contributes to the glucose repression signaling pathway. In addition, CaHxk2 participates to oxidative, osmotic and cell wall stress responses, while glucokinases are overexpressed under hypoxia. Hexose phosphorylation is a key step necessary for filamentation, that is affected in the hexokinase mutant. Virulence of this mutant is clearly impacted in the Galleria mellonella and macrophage models. Filamentation, glucose phosphorylation and stress response defects of the hexokinase mutant prevent host killing by C. albicans. By contributing to metabolic flexibility, stress answer response and morphogenesis, hexose kinase enzymes play an essential role in the virulence of C. albicans.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe pathogenic yeast C. albicans is both a powerful commensal and pathogen of humans that can infect wide range of organs and body sites. To grow in its host and establish an infection, the pathogen must assimilate carbon from these heterogenous environments. C. albicans regulates central carbon metabolism in a niche-specific manner, activating alternatively gluconeogenesis, glyoxylate cycle and the glycolytic metabolism. For yeast and other microorganisms, glucose is the preferred carbon and energy source and its accurate detection and metabolism is essential. However, the glycolytic hexose kinase system has not been investigated yet in C. albicans. In this report, we showed that hexokinase and glucokinases contribute to the fitness and virulence of C. albicans. We revealed the main metabolic role of the hexokinase CaHxk2 which impacts on growth, glucose signalling, morphological transition and virulence. However, glucokinases contribute to the anoxic response and their implication in regulation processes is suggested.",

The discovery that deep convolutional networks achieve human performance in realistic tasks offers fresh opportunities for such modeling. Here we show that the face-space topography of face-selective columns recorded intra-cranially in 32 patients significantly matches that of a DCNN having human-level face recognition capabilities. Three modeling aspects converge in pointing to a role of human face areas in pictorial rather than person identification: First, the match was confined to intermediate layers of the DCNN. Second, identity preserving image manipulations abolished the brain to DCNN correlation. Third, DCNN neurons matching face-column tuning displayed view-point selective receptive fields. Our results point to a \\\"convergent evolution\\\" of pattern similarities in biological and artificial face perception. They demonstrate DCNNs as a powerful modeling approach for deciphering the function of human cortical networks.",

Currently, there is no agreement on the best treatment protocol of such injury. This study was aimed to compare the outcomes of resuscitation with various volumes of hypertonic saline (HTS), whole blood (WB) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in a rat model of penetrating brain injury combined with controlled hemorrhagic shock in order to look for optimal treatment. Anesthetized rats were intubated and ventilated. 30% of circulating blood volume was withdrawn following open brain injury, and intravenous resuscitation with various volumes of HTS, WB and FFP (3, 9, and 18 ml/kg) was administered. Blood samples were collected during the experiment for measurements of lactate and base excess levels, and before sacrifice for neutrophil counts. Twenty four and 48 hours after the injury, rats neurological status was examined. Rats were, then, sacrificed and pathological studies of brain and lung sections were performed. Regardless of fluid type, resuscitation improved the mean arterial pressure and lactate levels in accordance to fluids volume. However, base excess was improved only when rats were treated with WB and FFP. Improvement in behavioral performance of the rats was observed when treated with 3 and 9 ml/kg HTS or with 18 ml/kg WB or FFP. Blood and lung neutrophils were reduced in rats treated with 9 or 18 ml/kg WB. Mortality rates were reduced in rats administered with 9 and 18 ml/kg of HTS or WB.

In our experiments, we change the proximity relationships of the cells by culturing them in wells with different shapes, and we find that the radiosensitivity of T47D human breast carcinoma cells in tight clusters is different from that of isolated cells. Molecular analyses show that T47D cells express a Syncytin-1 homologous protein (SyHP). We observe that SyHP translocates to the external surface of the plasma membrane of cells killed by radiation treatment. The data support the fundamental role of SyHP in the formation of intercellular cytoplasmic bridges and in the enhanced radioresistance of surviving cells. We conclude that complex and unexpected biological mechanisms of tumour radioresistance take place at the cell population level. These mechanisms may significantly bias our estimates of the radiosensitivity of breast carcinomas in vivo and thereby affect treatment plans, and they call for further investigations.",

Here we show that translation factor mRNAs are localized to distinct granules within yeast cells. In contrast to many mRNP granules, such as P-bodies and stress granules, which contain translationally repressed mRNAs, these granules harbor translated mRNAs under active growth conditions. The granules require Pablp for their integrity and are inherited by developing daughter cells in a She2p/ She3p dependent manner. These results point to a model where roughly half the mRNA for certain translation factors are specifically directed in granules toward the tip of the developing daughter cell where protein synthesis is most heavily required, which has particular implications for filamentous forms of growth. Such a feedforward mechanism would ensure adequate provision of the translation machinery where it is to be needed most over the coming growth cycle.\n\nSummaryThis study shows that mRNAs encoding a range of translation factors are localized to granules that get transported into the yeast daughter cell using the She2p/She3p machinery.

    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is known to be an effective treatment for a variety of neurological disorders, including Parkinsons disease and essential tremor (ET). At present, it involves administering a train of pulses with constant frequency via electrodes implanted into the brain. New  closed-loop approaches involve delivering stimulation according to the ongoing symptoms or brain activity and have the potential to provide improvements in terms of efficiency, efficacy and reduction of side effects. The success of closed-loop DBS depends on being able to devise a stimulation strategy that minimizes oscillations in neural activity associated with symptoms of motor disorders. A useful stepping stone towards this is to construct a mathematical model, which can describe how the brain oscillations should change when stimulation is applied at a particular state of the system. Our work focuses on the use of coupled oscillators to represent neurons in areas generating pathological oscillations. Using a reduced form of the Kuramoto model, we analyse how a patient should respond to stimulation when neural oscillations have a given phase and amplitude. We predict that, provided certain conditions are satisfied, the best stimulation strategy should be phase specific but also that stimulation should have a greater effect if applied when the amplitude of brain oscillations is lower. We compare this surprising prediction with data obtained from ET patients. In light of our predictions, we also propose a new hybrid strategy which effectively combines two of the strategies found in the literature, namely phase-locked and adaptive DBS.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDeep brain stimulation (DBS) involves delivering electrical impulses to target sites within the brain and is a proven therapy for a variety of neurological disorders. Closed loop DBS is a promising new approach where stimulation is applied according to the state of a patient. Crucial to the success of this approach is being able to predict how a patient should respond to stimulation. Our work focusses on DBS as applied to patients with essential tremor (ET). On the basis of a theoretical model, which describes neurons as oscillators that respond to stimulation and have a certain tendency to synchronize, we provide predictions for how a patient should respond when stimulation is applied at a particular phase and amplitude of the ongoing tremor oscillations. Previous experimental studies of closed loop DBS provided stimulation either on the basis of ongoing phase or amplitude of pathological oscillations. Our study suggests how both of these measurements can be used to control stimulation. As part of this work, we also look for evidence for our theories in experimental data and find our predictions to be satisfied in one patient. The insights obtained from this work should lead to a better understanding of how to optimise closed loop DBS strategies.",

The AT-bias of endosymbiotic genomes is commonly explained by neutral evolutionary processes. Here we show experimentally that an increased AT-content of host-dependent elements can be selectively favoured on the host level. Manipulating the nucleotide composition of bacterial cells by introducing A+T-or G+C-rich plasmids, we demonstrate that cells containing GC-rich plasmids are less fit than cells containing AT-rich plasmids. Moreover, the cost of GC-rich elements could be compensated by providing G+C-, but not A+T-precursors, thus linking the observed fitness effects to the cytoplasmic availability of nucleotides. Our work identifies selection as a strong evolutionary force that drives the genomes of intracellular genetic elements toward higher A+T contents.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGenomes of endosymbiotic bacteria are commonly more AT-rich than the ones of their free-living relatives. Interestingly, genomes of other intracellular elements like plasmids or bacteriophages also tend to be richer in AT than the genomes of their hosts. The AT-bias of endosymbiotic genomes is commonly explained by neutral evolutionary processes. However, since A+T nucleotides are both more abundant and energetically less expensive than G+C nucleotides, an alternative explanation is that selective advantages drive the nucleotide composition of intracellular elements. Here we provide strong experimental evidence that intracellular elements, whose genome is more AT-rich than the genome of the host, are selectively favored on the host level.

Previous studies showed that this infection alters physiological activities in mouse oviducts. Whether this occurs in the uterus and cervix has never been investigated. This study characterized the physiological activity of the uterus and the cervix in a Chlamydia muridarum (Cmu) mouse model of reproductive tract infection. Uterine or cervix smooth muscle contractility, responses to oxytocin or prostaglandins (PGF2 and PGE2) and mRNA expression of oxytocin and PG receptors were assessed 14 days post infection. Cmu infection did not affect the contractions of the uterine horn but significantly decreased the contraction amplitude of the cervix. Cmu infection did not alter the responses of uterine horn or cervix to oxytocin, however PGF2 induced contractions of the uterine horn, but not the cervix, were significantly increased following Cmu infection. PGE2 contraction amplitude in both the uterine horn and cervix was unaffected by Cmu infection. An upregulation of Ptgfr and a down-regulation of Ptegr4 mRNA expression was observed in the uterine horn following Cmu infection. These results indicate that Cmu infection alters contractility and prostaglandin signalling in the female reproductive tract but the effects are localised to specific regions.",

    "abstract": "It is currently believed that type I and III interferons (IFNs) have redundant functions. However, the preferential distribution of type III IFN receptor on epithelial cells suggests functional differences at epithelial surfaces. Here, using human intestinal epithelial cells we could show that although both type I and type III IFNs confer an antiviral state to the cells, they do so with distinct kinetics. Type I IFN signaling is characterized by an acute strong induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and confers fast antiviral protection. On the contrary, the slow acting type III IFN mediated antiviral protection is characterized by a weaker induction of ISGs in a delayed manner compared to type I IFN. Moreover, while transcript profiling revealed that both IFNs induced a similar set of ISGs, their temporal expression strictly depended on the IFNs, thereby leading to unique antiviral environments. Using a combination of data-driven mathematical modeling and experimental validation, we addressed the molecular reason for this differential kinetic of ISG expression. We could demonstrate that these kinetic differences are intrinsic to each signaling pathway and not due to different expression levels of the corresponding IFN receptors. We report that type III IFN is specifically tailored to act in specific cell types not only due to the restriction of its receptor but also by providing target cells with a distinct antiviral environment compared to type I IFN. We propose that this specific environment is key at surfaces that are often challenged with the extracellular environment.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe human intestinal tract plays two important roles in the body: first it is responsible for nutrient absorption and second it is the primary barrier which protects the human body from the outside environment. This complex tissue is constantly exposed to commensal bacteria and is often exposed to both bacterial and viral pathogens. To protect itself, the gut produces, among others, secreted agents called interferons which help to fight against pathogen attacks. There are several varieties (type I, II, and III) of interferons and our work aims at understanding how type I and III interferon act to protect human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs) during viral infection. In this study, we confirmed that both interferons can protect hIECs against viral infection but with different kinetics. We determined that type I confer an antiviral state to hIECs faster than type III interferons. We uncovered that these differences were intrinsic to each pathway and not the result of differential abundance of the respective interferon receptors. The results of this study suggest that type III interferon may provide a different antiviral environment to the epithelium target cells which is likely critical for maintaining gut homeostasis. Our findings will also help us to design therapies to aid in controlling and eliminating viral infections of the gut.",

Receptor kinase signaling is in part controlled through endocytosis and subcellular distribution of the respective receptor kinase. For the majority of plant cell surface receptors the underlying trafficking mechanisms are not characterized. In Arabidopsis, tissue morphogenesis relies on the atypical receptor kinase STRUBBELIG (SUB). Here, we approach the endocytic mechanism of SUB. Our data reveal that a functional SUB:EGFP fusion is ubiquitinated in vivo. We further show that plasma membrane-bound SUB:EGFP becomes internalized in a clathrin-dependent fashion. We also find that SUB:EGFP associates with the trans-Golgi network and accumulates in multivesicular bodies and the vacuole. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments reveal that SUB:EGFP and clathrin are present within the same protein complex. Our genetic analysis shows that SUB and CLATHRIN HEAVY CHAIN 2 promote root hair patterning. By contrast, SUB behaves as a negative regulator of a clathrin-dependent process during floral development. Taken together, the data indicate that SUB undergoes clathrin-mediated endocytosis, that this process does not dependent on stimulation of SUB signaling by an exogenous agent, and that SUB genetically interacts with clathrin-dependent pathways in a tissue-specific manner.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt has long been hypothesized that birth weight has a profound long-term impact on individual predisposition to various diseases at adulthood: a hypothesis commonly referred to as the fetal origins of adult diseases. However, it is not fully clear to what extent the fetal origins of adult diseases hypothesis holds and it is also not completely known what types of adult diseases are causally affected by birth weight. Determining the causal impact of birth weight on various adult diseases through traditional randomised intervention studies is a challenging task.\\n\\nMethodsMendelian randomisation was employed and multiple genetic variants associated with birth weight were used as instruments to explore the relationship between 21 adult diseases and 38 other complex traits from 37 large-scale genome-wide association studies up to 340,000 individuals of European ancestry. Causal effects of birth weight were estimated using inverse-variance weighted methods. The identified causal relationships between birth weight and adult diseases were further validated through extensive sensitivity analyses and simulations.\\n\\nResultsAmong the 21 adult diseases, three were identified to be inversely causally affected by birth weight with a statistical significance level passing the Bonferroni corrected significance threshold. The measurement unit of birth weight was defined as its standard deviation (i.e. 488 grams), and one unit lower birth weight was causally related to an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and BMI-adjusted T2D, with the estimated odds ratios of 1.34 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 - 1.53, p = 1.54E-5], 1.30 (95% CI 1.13 - 1.51, p = 3.31E-4), 1.41 (95% CI 1.15 - 1.73, p = 1.11E-3) and 1.54 (95% CI 1.25 - 1.89, p = 6.07E-5), respectively. All these identified causal associations were robust across various sensitivity analyses that guard against various confounding due to pleiotropy or maternal effects as well as inverse causation. In addition, analysis on 38 additional complex traits found that the inverse causal association between birth weight and CAD/MI/T2D was not likely to be mediated by other risk factors such as blood-pressure related traits and adult weight.\\n\\nConclusionsThe results suggest that lower birth weight is causally associated with an increased risk of CAD, MI and T2D in later life, supporting the fetal origins of adult diseases hypothesis.",

The model gives an estimate of the incidence probability density as a function of the sampling effort, and can be reversed to derive adequate monitoring patterns ensuring a given maximum incidence in the population. We then present an approximation of this model, providing a simple rule of thumb for practitioners.

    "abstract": "BackgroundPostmarketing commitments are clinical studies that drug sponsors agree to conduct at the time of FDA approval, but which are not required by statute or regulation. The objective of this study was to determine the characteristics, completion, and dissemination of postmarketing commitments agreed upon by sponsors at first FDA approval.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed a cross-sectional analysis of postmarketing commitments for new drugs and biologics approved 2009-2012. Using public FDA documents, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Scopus, we determined postmarketing commitments and their characteristics known at the time of FDA approval; number of postmarketing commitments subject to reporting requirements, for which FDA is required to make study status information available to the public (\\\"506B studies\\\"), and their statuses; and rates of registration and results reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov and publication in peer-reviewed journals for all clinical trials, with follow-up through July 2018.\\n\\nResultsAmong 110 novel drugs and biologics approved by the FDA between 2009-2012, 61 (55.5%) had at least one postmarketing commitment at the time of first approval. Of 331 total postmarketing commitments, 271 (81.9%) were non-human subjects research, predominantly chemistry, manufacturing, and controls studies; 49 (14.8%) were clinical trials (33 new and 16 ongoing trials for which follow-up results would be reported). Study descriptions for the new clinical trials often lacked information to establish study design features. Of the 89 (26.9%) 506B studies subject to public reporting requirements, of which 42 were clinical trials, 59 (66.3%) did not have an up-to-date status provided by FDA. Nearly all new clinical trials (28 of 31, 90.3%) were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov; of the 23 registered trials that were completed or terminated, 22 (95.7%) had reported results. Only half (14 of 29, 48.3%) of completed or terminated clinical trials, registered or unregistered, were published in peer-reviewed journals. Conclusions: The majority of postmarketing commitments agreed to by sponsors at the time of FDA approval for novel drugs and biologics approved between 2009-2012 were chemistry, manufacturing, and controls studies. While only 15% were clinical trials, these trials were nearly always registered with reported results on ClinicalTrials.gov. However, despite FDA public reporting requirements, up-to-date study status information was often unavailable for 506B studies.",

We used the Individualized Coherent Absolute Risk Estimation (iCARE) tool for comparative model validation of five-year risk of invasive breast cancer in a prospective cohort, and to make projections for population risk stratification.\\n\\nMethodsPerformance of two recently developed models, iCARE-BPC3 and iCARE-Lit, were compared with two established models (BCRAT, IBIS) based on classical risk factors in a UK-based cohort of 64,874 women (863 cases) aged 35-74 years. Risk projections in US White non-Hispanic women aged 50-70 years were made to assess potential improvements in risk stratification by adding mammographic breast density (MD) and polygenic risk score (PRS).\\n\\nResultsThe best calibrated models were iCARE-Lit (expected to observed number of cases (E/O)=0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.87 to 1.11)) for women younger than 50 years; and iCARE-BPC3 (E/O=1.00 (0.93 to 1.09)) for women 50 years or older. Risk projections using iCARE-BPC3 indicated classical risk factors can identify ~500,000 women at moderate to high risk (>3% five-year risk). Additional information on MD and a PRS based on 172 variants is expected to increase this to ~3.6 million, and among them, ~155,000 invasive breast cancer cases are expected within five years.\\n\\nConclusionsiCARE models based on classical risk factors perform similarly or better than BCRAT or IBIS.

    "abstract": "Mendelian randomization (MR) is an established approach for estimating the causal effect of an environmental exposure on a downstream outcome. The gene x environment (GxE) study design can be used within an MR framework to determine whether MR estimates may be biased if the genetic instrument affects the outcome through pathways other than via the exposure of interest (known as horizontal pleiotropy). MR phenome-wide association studies (MR-pheWAS) search for the effects of an exposure, and a recently published tool (PHESANT) means that it is now possible to do this comprehensively, across thousands of traits in UK Biobank. In this study, we introduce the GxE MR-pheWAS approach, and search for the causal effects of smoking heaviness - stratifying on smoking status (ever versus never) - as an exemplar. If a genetic variant is associated with smoking heaviness (but not smoking initiation), and this variant affects an outcome (at least partially) via tobacco intake, we would expect the effect of the variant on the outcome to differ in ever versus never smokers. If this effect is entirely mediated by tobacco intake, we would expect to see an effect in ever smokers but not never smokers. We used PHESANT to search for the causal effects of smoking heaviness, instrumented by genetic variant rs16969968, among never and ever smokers respectively, in UK Biobank. We ranked results by: 1) strength of effect of rs16969968 among ever smokers, and 2) strength of interaction between ever and never smokers. We replicated previously established causal effects of smoking heaviness, including a detrimental effect on lung function and pulse rate. Novel results included a detrimental effect of heavier smoking on facial aging. We have demonstrated how GxE MR-pheWAS can be used to identify causal effects of an exposure, while simultaneously assessing the extent that results may be biased by horizontal pleiotropy.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMendelian randomization uses genetic variants associated with an exposure to investigate causality. For instance, a genetic variant that relates to how heavily a person smokes has been used to test whether smoking causally affects health outcomes. Mendelian randomization is biased if the genetic variant also affects the outcome via other pathways. We exploit additional information - that the effect of heavy smoking only occurs in people who actually smoke - to overcome this problem. By testing associations in ever and never smokers separately we can assess whether the genetic variant affects an outcome via smoking or another pathway. If the effect is entirely via smoking heaviness, we would expect to see an effect in ever but not never smokers, and this would suggest that smoking causally influences the outcome. Previous Mendelian randomization studies of smoking heaviness focused on specific outcomes - here we searched for the causal effects of smoking heaviness across over 18,000 traits. We identified previously established effects (e.g. a detrimental effect on lung function) and novel results including a detrimental effect of heavier smoking on facial aging. Our approach can be used to search for the causal effects of other exposures, where the exposure only occurs in known subsets of the population.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome sequence (WGS) data for bacterial pathogens can provide evidence as to the source of nosocomial infection, and more specifically the ability to distinguish between intra- and inter-hospital transmission. This is currently achieved either through using SNP thresholds, which can lack statistical robustness, or by constructing phylogenetic trees, which can be computationally expensive and difficult to interpret. Here we compare two alternative statistical approaches using 1022 genomes of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clone ST22. In 71% of cases both methods predict the same hospital origin, which is also supported by the ML tree. Robust assignments are divided approximately equally between intra-hospital transmission and inter-hospital transmission. Our approaches are rapid and produce intuitive output that could inform on immediate infection control priorities, as well as providing long-term data on inter-hospital transmission networks. We discuss the strengths and weakness of our methods, and the generalisability of this approach.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryWe present rapid statistical methods for distinguishing intra- versus inter-hospital transmission of bacterial pathogens using whole genome sequence data; these methods do not require the use of SNP thresholds or the generation and interpretation of phylogenetic trees.",

Since neither RIGHT nor AGREE-II can judge the clinical usefulness of a guideline, our study is designed to only focus on the methodological and reporting quality of each guideline.\\n\\nResultsThe NCCN guidelines demonstrated notable strengths and weaknesses. For example, RIGHT statement items 19 (conflicts of interest), 7b (description of subgroups), and 13a (clear, precise recommendations) were fully reported in all guidelines. However, the guidelines inconsistently incorporated patient values and preferences and cost, nor did they consistently describe the method for assessing the quality and certainty of evidence. Regarding the AGREE II instrument, the NCCN guidelines scored highly on the domains 4 (clear, precise recommendations) and 6 (handling of conflicts of interest), but lowest on domain 2 (inclusion of all relevant stakeholders).\\n\\nConclusionsIn this investigation we found that NCCN CPGs demonstrate key strengths and weaknesses with respect to the reporting of key items essential to CPGs. We recommend the continued use of NCCN guidelines and adherence to the RIGHT and AGREE II items.

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a late-onset fatal neurodegenerative disorder that is predicted to increase across the globe by ~70% in the following decades. Understanding the disease causal mechanism underlying ALS and identifying modifiable risks factors for ALS hold the key for the development of effective preventative and treatment strategies. Here, we investigate the causal effects of four blood lipid traits that include high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG) on the risk of ALS. By leveraging instrument variables from multiple large-scale genome-wide association studies in both European and East Asian populations, we carry out one of the largest and most comprehensive Mendelian randomization analyses performed to date on the causal relationship between lipids and ALS. Among the four lipids, we found that only LDL is causally associated with ALS and that higher LDL level increases the risk of ALS in both the European and East Asian populations. Specifically, the odds ratio of ALS per one standard deviation (i.e. 39.0 mg/dL) increase of LDL is estimated to be 1.14 (95% CI 1.05 - 1.24, p = 1.38E-3) in the European and population and 1.06 (95% CI 1.00 - 1.12, p = 0.044) in the East Asian population. The identified causal relationship between LDL and ALS is robust with respect to the choice of statistical methods and is validated through extensive sensitivity analyses that guard against various model assumption violations. Our study provides important evidence supporting the causal role of higher LDL on increasing the risk of ALS, paving ways for the development of preventative strategies for reducing the disease burden of ALS across multiple nations.",

    "abstract": "The human postsynaptic density is an elaborate network comprising thousands of proteins, playing a vital role in the molecular events of learning and the formation of memory. Despite our growing knowledge of specific proteins and their interactions, atomic-level details of their full three-dimensional structure and their rearrangements are mostly elusive. Advancements in structural bioinformatics enabled us to depict the characteristic features of proteins involved in different processes aiding neurotransmission. We show that postsynaptic protein-protein interactions are mediated through the delicate balance of intrinsically disordered regions and folded domains, and this duality is also imprinted in the amino acid sequence. We introduce Diversity of Potential Interactions (DPI), a structure and regulation based descriptor to assess the diversity of interactions. Our approach reveals that the postsynaptic proteome has its own characteristic features and these properties reliably discriminate them from other proteins of the human proteome. Our results suggest that postsynaptic proteins are especially susceptible to forming diverse interactions with each other, which might be key in the reorganization of the PSD in molecular processes related to learning and memory.",

    "abstract": "Age-associated chronic inflammation (inflammaging) has emerged as a central hallmark of aging1-3, but its impact on specific cells is still largely unknown. Fibroblasts are present in all tissues and contribute to wound healing4-6. They are also the cell type that is mostly used for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming7 - a process that has implications for regenerative medicine and rejuvenation strategies8-17. Here we show that primary fibroblasts from old mice secrete inflammatory cytokines and that there is an increased variability in reprogramming efficiency between fibroblast cultures from old individuals. Individual-to-individual variability is emerging as a key feature of old age18-21, which could reflect distinct aging trajectories, but the underlying causes remain unknown. To identify drivers of this variability, we perform a multi-omic assessment of young and old fibroblast cultures with different reprogramming efficiency. This approach, coupled with single cell transcriptomics, reveals that old fibroblast cultures are heterogeneous and show a greater proportion of  activated fibroblasts that secrete inflammatory cytokines, which correlates with reprogramming efficiency. We experimentally validate that activated fibroblasts express inflammatory cytokines in vivo and that their presence is linked to enhanced reprogramming efficiency in culture. Conditioned-media swapping experiments show that extrinsic factors secreted by activated fibroblasts are more critical than intrinsic factors for the individual-to-individual variability in reprogramming efficiency, and we identify TNF as a key inflammatory cytokine underlying this variability. Interestingly, old mice also exhibit variability in wound healing efficiency in vivo and old wounds show an increased subpopulation of activated fibroblasts with a unique TNF signature. Our study shows that a switch in fibroblast composition, and the ratio of inflammatory cytokines they secrete, drives variability in reprogramming in vitro and may influence wound healing in vivo. These findings could help identify personalized strategies to improve iPSC generation and wound healing in older individuals.",

After secretion, Shh must traverse a distance through the extracellular matrix (ECM) to reach the target cells and activate the Hh response. Extracellular matrix proteins, in particular the Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPGs) of the Glypican family have both negative and positive effects on non-cell autonomous Shh signaling, all attributed to their ability to bind Shh. Using mouse embryonic stem cell-derived mosaic tissues with compartments that lack the glycosyltransferases Exostosin1 (Ext1) and Exostosin2 (Ext2), or the HSPG core protein Glypican5 we show that cells surrounded by a mutated extracellular matrix are highly proficient distributing Shh. In contrast, cells that lack Ext1 function poorly secrete Shh. Our results confirm earlier observations that HSPGs can have both positive (Shh export) and negative influences (Shh distribution), and are supporting a model in which Shh presented on the cell surface in the context of HSPGs preferentially distributes into ECM that lacks HSPGs, possibly due to the absence of Shh sequestering molecules.",
