    "abstract": "Flaviviruses limit the cell stress response by preventing the formation of stress granules and utilize different proteins involved in the stress granule pathway to modulate viral gene expression. In this study, we investigated the formation of stress granules during Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and the role stress granule proteins play during the viral life cycle. Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, we determined that ZIKV disrupted the formation of arsenite-induced stress granules and changed the subcellular distribution, but not the abundance or integrity of stress granule proteins. To investigate the role of different stress granule proteins in ZIKV infection we used target-specific siRNAs to deplete six proteins, namely Ataxin2, G3BP1, HuR, TIA-1, TIAR and YB-1. Depletion of TIA-1 and TIAR affected ZIKV protein and RNA levels, but viral titers did not change. Conversely, depletion of Ataxin2 and YB-1 decreased virion production despite having only a small effect on ZIKV protein and expression. Notably, however, depletion of G3BP1 and HuR decreased and increased ZIKV gene expression and virion production, respectively. Using an MR766 Gaussia luciferase reporter genome together with knockdown and overexpression assays, G3BP1 and HuR were found to modulate ZIKV replication. These data indicate that ZIKV disrupts the formation of stress granules by sequestering stress granule proteins required for replication, which is where G3BP1 functions to promote ZIKV infection, while HuR exhibits an antiviral effect. The consequence of ZIKV re-localizing and subverting select stress granule proteins might have broader consequences on cellular RNA homeostasis contributing to cellular gene dysregulation and ZIKV pathogenesis.\\n\\nImportanceIn response to viral infection, cellular translation is stalled, and translation initiation complexes, cellular mRNAs, and RNA binding proteins aggregate in stress granules. Because the assembly of stress granules antagonize translation of viral proteins, which is a critical step for single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses to replicate the viral genome, many viruses have developed strategies to inhibit stress granule formation. In this study, we observed that Zika virus restricts the formation of stress granules likely by re-localizing specific stress granule proteins during infection. We also determined that specific stress granule proteins function to facilitate and limit Zika virus replication. This interaction of Zika virus with stress granule proteins is interesting, as many stress granule proteins are also known to function in neuronal granules, which are critical in neural development and function. Moreover, dysregulation of different stress granule proteins in neurons has been shown to play a role in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The likely consequences of Zika virus modulating stress granule assembly and subverting specific stress granule proteins are alterations to cellular mRNA transcription, splicing, RNA stability, and translation. Such changes in cellular ribostasis could have profound effects on neural development and contribute to the devastating developmental and neurological anomalies observed following intrauterine Zika virus infection. Our study provides new insights into virus-host interactions and the identification of the stress granule proteins that may contribute to the unusual pathogenesis associated with this reemerging arbovirus.",

    "abstract": "The battle against malaria has been substantially impeded by the recurrence of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest human malaria parasite. To counter the problem, novel antimalarial drugs are urgently needed, especially those that target unique pathways of the parasite, since they are less likely to have side effects. The mitochondrial type II NADH dehydrogenase of P. falciparum, PfNDH2 (PF3D7_0915000), has been considered a good prospective antimalarial drug target for over a decade, since malaria parasites lack the conventional multi-subunit NADH dehydrogenase, or Complex I, present in the mammalian mitochondrial electron transport chain (mtETC). Instead, Plasmodium parasites contain a single subunit NDH2, which lacks proton pumping activity and is absent in humans. A significant amount of effort has been expended to develop PfNDH2 specific inhibitors, yet the essentiality of PfNDH2 has not been convincingly verified. Herein, we knocked out PfNDH2 in P. falciparum via a CRISPR/Cas9 mediated approach. Deletion of PfNDH2 does not alter the parasites susceptibility to multiple mtETC inhibitors, including atovaquone and ELQ-300. We also show that the antimalarial activity of the fungal NDH2 inhibitor HDQ and its new derivative CK-2-68 is due to inhibition of the parasite cytochrome bc1 complex rather than PfNDH2. These compounds directly inhibit the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity of the malarial bc1 complex. Our results call into question the validity of PfNDH2 as an antimalarial drug target.\\n\\nImportanceFor a long time, PfNDH2 has been considered an attractive antimalarial drug target. However, the conclusion that PfNDH2 is essential was based on preliminary and incomplete data. Here we generate a PfNDH2 KO (knockout) parasite in the blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum, showing that the gene is not essential. We also show that previously reported PfNDH2-specific inhibitors kill the parasites primarily via targeting the cytochrome bc1 complex, not PfNDH2. Overall, we provide genetic and biochemical data that help to resolve a long-debated issue in the field regarding the potential of PfNDH2 as an antimalarial drug target.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria adapt to environmental changes and interact with other microorganisms using a wide array of molecules, metabolic plasticity, secretion systems and the formation of biofilms. Some research has looked at changes in the expression of biofilm related genes during interactions between different bacterial species, however no studies have directly demonstrated the functional significance of biofilms in modulating such interactions. In this study, we have explored this fundamental question by studying the interaction between Bacillus subtilis 3610 and Pseudomonas chlororaphis PCL1606. We demonstrate the important role of the extracellular matrix in protecting B. subtilis colonies from infiltration by Pseudomonas. Surprisingly, we find that the Pseudomonas type VI secretion system (T6SS) is required in the cell-to-cell contact with matrix-impaired B. subtilis cells, revealing a novel role for T6SS against Gram-positive bacteria. In response to P. chlororaphis infiltration, we find that B. subtilis activates sporulation and expresses motility-related genes. Experiments using plant organs demonstrate the functional importance of these different bacterial strategies in their coexistence as stable bacterial communities. The findings described here further our understanding of the functional role played by biofilms in mediating bacterial social interactions.",

We develop fundamental microfluidic features to control droplets flowing in an immiscible carrier fluid within open microfluidic systems. Our systems use capillary flow to move droplets and carrier fluid through open channels and are easily fabricated through 3D printing, micromilling, or injection molding; further, droplet generation can be accomplished by simply pipetting into the open channel. We demonstrate droplet incubation and transport for downstream experimentation and tunable droplet splitting in open channels driven by capillary flow.

    "abstract": "A new version of the coarse-grained (CG) SIRAH force field for proteins has been developed. Modifications to bonded and non-bonded interactions on the existing molecular topologies significantly ameliorate the structural description and flexibility of a non-redundant set of proteins. The SIRAH 2.0 force field has also been ported to the popular simulation package AMBER, which along with the former implementation in GROMACS expands significantly the potential range of users and performance of this CG force field on CPU/GPU codes.\\n\\nAs a non-trivial example of application, we undertook the structural and dynamical analysis of the most abundant and conserved calcium-binding protein, namely, Calmodulin (CaM). CaM is constituted by two calcium-binding motifs called EF-hands, which in presence of Calcium specifically recognize a cognate peptide by embracing it. CG simulations of CaM bound to four Calcium ions in the presence or absence of a binding peptide (holo and apo forms, respectively), resulted in good and stable ion coordination. The simulation of the holo form starting from an experimental structure sampled near-native conformations, retrieving quasi-atomistic precision. Removing the binding peptide enabled the EF-hands to perform large reciprocal movements, comparable to those observed in NMR structures. On the other hand, the isolated peptide starting from the helical conformation experienced spontaneous unfolding, in agreement with previous experimental data. However, repositioning the peptide in the neighborhood of one EF-hand not only prevented the peptide unfolding but also drove CaM to a fully bound conformation with both EF-hands embracing the cognate peptide, resembling the experimental holo structure.\\n\\nTherefore, SIRAH 2.0 showed the capacity to handle a number of structurally and dynamically challenging situations including metal ion coordination, unbiased conformational sampling, and specific protein-peptide recognition.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=194 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/436774_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (43K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d1ecc3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10f1a04org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@752a49org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2b5746_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG TOC.

Genetic factors may only convey disease risk in individuals with certain environmental exposures, suggesting that a multi-omics approach could reveal underlying mechanisms contributing to complex traits, such as AD. We developed an integrated network to investigate relationships between metabolomics, genomics, and AD risk factors using Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimers Prevention participants. Analyses included 1,111 non-Hispanic Caucasian participants with whole blood expression for 11,376 genes (imputed from dense genome-wide genotyping), 1,097 fasting plasma metabolites, and 17 AD risk factors. A subset of 155 individuals also had 364 fasting cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) metabolites. After adjusting each of these 12,854 variables for potential confounders, we developed an undirected graphical network, representing all significant pairwise correlations upon adjusting for multiple testing. There were many instances of genes being indirectly linked to AD risk factors through metabolites, suggesting that genes may influence AD risk through particular metabolites. Follow-up analyses suggested that glycine mediates the relationship between CPS1 and measures of cardiovascular and diabetes risk, including body mass index, waist-hip ratio, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Further, 38 CSF metabolites explained more than 60% of the variance of CSF levels of tau, a detrimental protein that accumulates in the brain of AD patients and is necessary for its diagnosis. These results further our understanding of underlying mechanisms contributing to AD risk while demonstrating the utility of generating and integrating multiple omics data types.",

    "abstract": "The neocortex is capable of anticipating the sensory results of movement but the neural mechanisms are poorly understood. In the entorhinal cortex, grid cells represent the location of an animal in its environment, and this location is updated through movement and path integration. In this paper, we propose that sensory neocortex incorporates movement using grid cell-like neurons that represent the location of sensors on an object. We describe a two-layer neural network model that uses cortical grid cells and path integration to robustly learn and recognize objects through movement and predict sensory stimuli after movement. A layer of cells consisting of several grid cell-like modules represents a location in the reference frame of a specific object. Another layer of cells which processes sensory input receives this location input as context and uses it to encode the sensory input in the objects reference frame. Sensory input causes the network to invoke previously learned locations that are consistent with the input, and motor input causes the network to update those locations. Simulations show that the model can learn hundreds of objects even when object features alone are insufficient for disambiguation. We discuss the relationship of the model to cortical circuitry and suggest that the reciprocal connections between layers 4 and 6 fit the requirements of the model. We propose that the subgranular layers of cortical columns employ grid cell-like mechanisms to represent object specific locations that are updated through movement.",

    "abstract": "Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\n\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.",

    "abstract": "Sleep restriction has been proposed to cause impaired emotional processing and emotional regulation by inhibiting top-down control from prefrontal cortex to amygdala. Intentional emotional regulation after sleep restriction has however never been studied using brain imaging. We here aimed to investigate the effect of sleep restriction on emotional regulation through cognitive reappraisal. Forty-seven young (age 20-30) and 33 older (age 65-75) participants (38/23 with complete data and successful sleep intervention) performed a cognitive reappraisal task during fMRI after a night of normal sleep and after restricted sleep (3h). Emotional downregulation was associated with significantly increased activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (pFWE < 0.05) and lateral orbital cortex (pFWE < 0.05) in young, but not in older subjects. Sleep restriction was associated with a decrease in self-reported regulation success to negative stimuli (p < 0.01) and a trend towards perceiving all stimuli as less negative (p = 0.07), in young participants. No effects of sleep restriction on brain activity nor connectivity were found in either age group. In conclusion, our data do not support the idea of a prefrontal-amygdala disconnect after sleep restriction, and neural mechanisms underlying behavioural effects on emotional regulation after insufficient sleep require further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Legumes form a mutualistic endosymbiosis with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. These rhizobia are housed intracellularly in specialised lateral root organs, called nodules. Initiation of these nodules is triggered by bacterial derived signalling molecules, lipochitooligosaccharides (LCO). The process of nitrogen fixation is highly energy-demanding and therefore nodule initiation is tightly regulated. Nitrate is a potent inhibitor of nodulation. However, the precise mechanisms by which nitrate inhibits nodulation is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that in Medicago truncatula nitrate interferes with the transcriptional regulation of the ethylene biosynthesis gene ACC SYNTHASE 10. ACSs commit the rate limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis and in M. truncatula ACS10 is highly expressed in the zone of the root where nodulation occurs. Our results show that a reduction in ACS10 expression in response to LCO exposure correlates with the ability to form nodules. In addition, RNAi-mediated knockdown of ACS10 confers nodulation ability under otherwise inhibitory nitrate conditions. This discovery sheds new light on how ethylene is involved in the inhibition of nodulation by nitrate, bringing us one step closer to understanding how plants regulate their susceptibility towards rhizobia.",

    "abstract": "A defining property of stem cells is their ability to differentiate via asymmetric cell division, in which a stem cell creates a differentiated daughter cell but retains its own phenotype. Here, we describe a synthetic genetic circuit for controlling asymmetrical cell division in Escherichia coli. Specifically, we engineered an inducible system that can bind and segregate plasmid DNA to a single position in the cell. Upon division, the co-localized plasmids are kept by one and only one of the daughter cells. The other daughter cell receives no plasmid DNA and is hence irreversibly differentiated from its sibling. In this way, we achieved asymmetric cell division though asymmetric plasmid partitioning. We also characterized an orthogonal inducible circuit that enables the simultaneous asymmetric partitioning of two plasmid species - resulting in pluripotent cells that have four distinct differentiated states. These results point the way towards engineering multicellular systems from prokaryotic hosts.",

    "abstract": "With increasing interest in feed based methane mitigation strategies, fueled by local legal directives aimed at methane production from the agricultural sector in California, identifying local sources of biological feed additives will be critical in keeping the implementation of these strategies affordable. In a recent study, the red alga Asparagopsis taxiformis stood out as the most effective species of seaweed to reduce methane production from enteric fermentation. Due to the potential differences in effectiveness based on the location from where A. taxiformis is collected and the financial burden of collection and transport, we tested the potential of A. taxiformis, as well as the brown seaweed Zonaria farlowii collected in the nearshore waters off Santa Catalina Island, CA, USA, for their ability to mitigate methane production during in-vitro rumen fermentation. At a dose rate of 5% dry matter (DM), A. taxiformis reduced methane production by 74% (p [&le;] 0.01) and Z. farlowii reduced methane production by 11% (p [&le;] 0.04) after 48 hours and 24 hours of in-vitro rumen fermentation respectively. The methane reducing effect of A. taxiformis and Z. farlowii described here make these local macroalgae promising candidates for biotic methane mitigation strategies in the largest milk producing state in the US. To determine their real potential as methane mitigating feed supplements in the dairy industry, their effect in-vivo requires investigation.",

    "abstract": "Control of organelle size is a problem that has intrigued cell biologists for at least a century. The single-celled green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with its two 2agella has proved to be a very useful model organism for studies of size control. Numerous experiments have identi1ed motor-driven transport of tubulin to the growing ends of microtubules at the tip of the 2agella as the key component of the machinery responsible for controlling their length. Here we consider a model of 2agellar length control whose key assumption is that proteins responsible for the intra2agellar transport (IFT) of tubulin are present in limiting amounts. We show that this limiting-pool assumption and simple reasoning based on the law of mass action leads to an inverse relationship between the rate at which a 2agellum grows and its length, which has been observed experimentally, and has been shown theoretically to provide a mechanism for length control. Experiments in which one of the two 2agella are severed have revealed the coupled nature of the growth dynamics of the two 2agella, and we extend our length-control model to two 2agella by considering different mechanisms of their coupling. We describe which coupling mechanisms are capable of reproducing the observed dynamics in severing experiments, and why some that have been proposed previously are not. Within our theoretical framework we conclude that if tubulin and IFT proteins are freely exchanged between 2agella simultaneous length control is not possible if the disassembly rate is constant. However, if disassembly depends on the concentration of IFT proteins at the tip of the 2agellum, simultaneous length control can be achieved. Finally, we make quantitative predictions for experiments that could test this model.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of marker genes such as 16S ribosomal RNA is widely used to survey microbial communities. The in-sample (alpha) diversity of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) is often summarized by metrics such as richness or entropy which are calculated from observed abundances, or by estimators such as Chao1 which extrapolate to unobserved OTUs. Most such measures are adopted from traditional biodiversity studies, where observational error can often be neglected. However, errors introduced by next-generation amplicon sequencing tend to induce spurious OTUs and spurious counts in OTU tables, both of which are especially prevalent at low abundances. In consequence, traditional metrics may be grossly inaccurate if they are naively applied to NGS OTU tables. In this work, we describe two novel alpha diversity estimators which are calculated from OTU abundances above a specified threshold. The singleton-free estimator (SFE) is a non-parametric estimator which is derived from a similar approach to Chao1 but extrapolates using doublet and triplet abundances rather than singletons and doublets. The octave estimator (OE) fits a log-normal distribution to non-singleton bars of an octave plot. We show that these estimators are effective under suitable conditions, but these conditions rarely apply in practice. We conclude that extrapolating to unobserved OTUs remains an open problem which is unlikely to be solved in the near future.",

Continuous epitope predicted by bioinformatics tools are commonly used and these sequential epitopes are used as such in further experiments.

    "abstract": "The mouse organ of Corti develops in two steps: progenitor specification and differentiation. Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling is important in this developmental pathway, as deletion of FGF receptor 1 (Fgfr1) or its ligand, Fgf20, leads to the loss of hair cells and supporting cells from the organ of Corti. However, whether FGF20-FGFR1 signaling is required during specification or differentiation, and how it interacts with the transcription factor Sox2, also important for hair cell and supporting cell development, has been a topic of debate. Here, we show that while FGF20-FGFR1 signaling functions during progenitor differentiation, FGFR1 has an FGF20-independent, Sox2-dependent role in specification. We also show that a combination of reduction in Sox2 expression and Fgf20 deletion recapitulates the Fgfr1-deletion phenotype. Furthermore, we uncovered a strong genetic interaction between Sox2 and Fgf20, especially in regulating the development of hair cells and supporting cells towards the basal end and the outer compartment of the organ of Corti. To explain this genetic interaction and its effects on the basal end of the organ of Corti, we provide evidence that decreased Sox2 expression delays specification, which begins at the organ of Corti apex, while Fgf20-deletion results in premature onset of differentiation, which begins near the organ of Corti base. Thereby, Sox2 and Fgf20 interact to ensure that specification occurs before differentiation towards the cochlear base. These findings reveal an intricate developmental program regulating organ of Corti development along the basal-apical axis of the cochlea.\n\nAuthor summaryThe mammalian cochlea contains the organ of Corti, a specialized sensory epithelium populated by hair cells and supporting cells that detect sound. Hair cells are susceptible to injury by noise, toxins, and other insults. In mammals, hair cells cannot be regenerated after injury, resulting in permanent hearing loss. Understanding genetic pathways that regulate hair cell development in the mammalian organ of Corti will help in developing methods to regenerate hair cells to treat hearing loss. Many genes are essential for hair cell and supporting cell development in the mouse organ of Corti. Among these are Sox2, Fgfr1, and Fgf20. Here, we investigate the relationship between these three genes to further define their roles in development.\n\nInterestingly, we found that Sox2 and Fgf20 interact to affect hair cell and supporting cell development in a spatially-graded manner. We found that cells toward the outer compartment and the base of the organ of Corti are more strongly affected by the loss of Sox2 and Fgf20. We provide evidence that this spatially-graded effect can be partially explained by the roles of the two genes in the precise timing of two sequential stages of organ of Corti development, specification and differentation.",

In particular, for semelparous capital breeders with determinate fecundity and no parental care other than gametic investment, the depletion of energetic stock must match the depletion of gametic stock, so that individuals get exhausted just after their last egg is laid and fertilized. Although these budgets are managed continuously, monitoring the dynamics of mating acts and energy expenditure at a fine temporal scale in the wild is challenging.\nC_LIO_LIThis study aimed to quantify the individual dynamics of spawning acts and the concomitant energy expenditure of female Allis shad (Alosa alosa) throughout their mating season.\nC_LIO_LIUsing eight individual-borne accelerometers for one month, we collected tri-axial acceleration, temperature, and pressure data that we analysed to i) detect the timing of spawning acts, ii) estimate energy expenditure from tail beat frequency and water temperature, and iii) monitor changes in body roundness from the position of the dorsally-mounted tag relative to the vertical plane.\nC_LIO_LIFemale shad had a higher probability to spawn during warmer nights, and their spawning acts were synchronized (both individually and inter-individually) within each active night. They experienced warmer temperature, remained deeper, swan more slowly and spent less energy during daytime than night time. Over one month of spawning, they performed on average 15.75 spawning acts, spent on average 6 277 kJ and died with a significant portion of residual oocytes.

However, cost and time efficient techniques such as high-throughput sequencing (HTS) based approaches may resolve the constraints encountered in conducting morphology-based surveys. Here, we characterized stream macroinvertebrate species diversity and community composition via metabarcoding and morphological analysis from environmental samples collected from the Shigenobu River Basin in Ehime Prefecture, Japan. We compared diversity metrics and assessed both approaches ability to evaluate the relationship between macroinvertebrate community and environmental variables. In total, we morphologically identified 45 taxa (3 families, six subfamilies, 31 genera, and five species) from 8,276 collected individuals from ten study sites. We detected 44 species by metabarcoding, with 35 species collapsed into 11 groups matching the morphologically identified taxa. A significant positive correlation between logged depth (number of HTS reads) and abundance of morphological taxa was observed, which implied that quantitative data can be used for subsequent analyses. Relatively higher estimates of alpha diversity were calculated from the metabarcoding data in comparison to morphology-based data. However, beta diversity estimates between metabarcoding and morphology data based on both incidence and abundance-based matrices were correlated proving that community differences between sampling sites were preserved in the molecular data. Also, both models were significant, but metabarcoding data (93%) explained a relatively higher percentage of variation in the relationship between community composition and the environmental variables than morphological data (91%). Overall, we present both the feasibility and limitations of HTS-driven estimations of taxonomic richness, community composition, and diversity metrics, and that metabarcoding was proven comparable and more sensitive against morphology-based analysis for stream macroinvertebrate biodiversity assessment and environmental monitoring.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that GC content varies across the genome in many species and that GC biased gene conversion, one form of meiotic recombination, is likely to contribute to this heterogeneity. Bird genomes provide an extraordinary system to study the impact of GC biased gene conversion owed to their specific genomic features. They are characterised by a high karyotype conservation with substantial heterogeneity in chromosome sizes, with up to a dozen large macrochromosomes and many smaller microchromosomes common across all bird species. This heterogeneity in chromosome morphology is also reflected by other genomic features, such as smaller chromosomes being gene denser, more compact and more GC rich relative to their macrochromosomal counterparts - illustrating that the intensity of GC biased gene conversion varies across the genome. Here we study whether it is possible to infer heterogeneity in GC biased gene conversion rates across the genome using a recently published method that accounts for GC biased gene conversion when estimating branch lengths in a phylogenetic context. To infer the strength of GC biased gene conversion we contrast branch length estimates across the genome both taking and not taking non-stationary GC composition into account. Using simulations we show that this approach works well when GC fixation bias is strong and note that the number of substitutions along a branch is consistently overestimated when GC biased gene conversion is not accounted for. We use this predictable feature to infer the strength of GC dynamics across the great tit genome by applying our new test statistic to data at 4-fold degenerate sites from three bird species - great tit, zebra finch and chicken - three species that are among the best annotated bird genomes to date. We show that using a simple one-dimensional binning we fail to capture a signal of fixation bias as observed in our simulations. However, using a multidimensional binning strategy, we find evidence for heterogeneity in the strength of fixation bias, including AT fixation bias. This highlights the difficulties when combining sequence data across different regions in the genome.",

    "abstract": "Few natural product pathways from rare Actinomycetes have been studied due to the difficulty in applying molecular approaches in these genetically intractable organisms. In this study, we sought to identify integrating vectors, derived using phage int/attP loci, that would efficiently integrate site-specifically in the rare Actinomycete, Amycolatopsis marina DSM45569. Analysis of the genome of A. marina DSM45569 indicated the presence of attB-like sequences for TG1 and R4 integrases. The TG1 and R4 attBs were active in in vitro recombination assays with their cognate purified integrases and attP loci. Integrating vectors containing either the TG1 or R4 int/attP loci yielded exconjugants in conjugation assays from E. coli to A. marina DSM45569. Site-specific recombination of the plasmids into the host TG1 or R4 attB sites was confirmed by sequencing. The presence of homologous TG1 and R4 attB sites in other species of this genus indicates that vectors based on TG1 and R4 integrases could be widely applicable.\\n\\nImportanceRare Actinomycetes have the same potential of natural product discovery as Streptomyces, but the potential has not been fully explored due to the lack of efficient molecular biology tools. In this study, we identified two serine integrases, TG1 and R4, which could be used in the rare Actinomycetes species, Amycolatopsis marina, as tools for genome integration. The high level of conservation between the attB sites for TG1 and R4 in a number of Amycolatopsis species suggested that plasmids with the integration systems from these phages should be widely useful in this genus.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria occupy heterogeneous environments, attaching and growing within pores in materials, living hosts, and matrices like soil. Systems that permit high-resolution visualization of dynamic bacterial processes within the physical confines of a realistic and tractable porous media environment are rare. Here we use microfluidics to replicate the particle shape and packing density of natural sands in a 2D platform to study the flow-induced spatial evolution of bacterial biofilms underground. We discover that initial bacterial dispersal and particle attachment is a stochastic process driven by bacterial rheotactic transport across pore space velocity gradients. Over time, we find that gravity-driven flow conditions activate different cell-clustering phentoypes in EPS producing and EPS defective bacteria strains, which subsequently changes the overall spatial distribution of cells across the porous media network as colonies grow and alter the fluid dynamics of their microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the nature of epileptic state transitions remains a major goal for epilepsy research. Simple in vitro models offer unique experimental opportunities, which we exploit to show that such transitions can arise from shifts in the ictal source of the activity. These transitions reflect the fact that cortical territories differ both in the type of epileptiform activity they can sustain, and their susceptibility to drug manipulation. In the zero Mg2+ model, the earliest epileptiform activity is restricted to neocortical and entorhinal networks. Hippocampal bursting only starts much later, and triggers a marked transition in neo-/entorhinal cortical activity. Thereafter, the hippocampal activity acts as a pacemaker, entraining the other territories to their discharge pattern. This entrainment persists following transection of the major axonal pathways between hippocampus and cortex, indicating that it can be mediated through a non-synaptic route. Neuronal discharges are associated with large rises in extracellular [K+], but we show that these are very localised, and therefore are not the means of entraining distant cortical areas. We conclude instead that the entrainment occurs through weak field effects distant from the pacemaker, but which are highly effective at recruiting other brain territories that are already hyperexcitable. The hippocampal epileptiform activity appears unusually susceptible to drugs that impact on K+ conductances. These findings demonstrate that the local circuitry gives rise to stereotypical epileptic activity patterns, but these are also influenced by both synaptic and non-synaptic long-range effects. Our results have important implications for our understanding of epileptic propagation, and anti-epileptic drug action.\\n\\nKey pointsO_LILocal neocortical and hippocampal territories show different and sterotypical patterns of acutely evolving, epileptiform activity.\\nC_LIO_LINeocortical and entorhinal networks show tonic-clonic-like events, but the main hippocampal territories do not, unless it is relayed from the other areas.\\nC_LIO_LITransitions in the pattern of locally recorded epileptiform activity can be indicative of a shift in the source of pathological activity, and which may spread through both synaptic and non-synaptic means.\\nC_LIO_LIHippocampal epileptiform activity is promoted by 4-aminopyridine and inhibited by GABAB agonists, and appears far more sensitive to these drugs than neocortical activity.\\nC_LIO_LIThese signature features of local epileptiform activity can provide useful insight into the primary source of ictal activity, aiding both experimental and clinical investigation.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In vivo imaging experiments often require automated detection and tracking of changes in the specimen. This problem, however, can be hindered by variations in the position and orientation of the specimen relative to the microscope, as well as by linear and nonlinear deformations. Here, we present a feature-based registration method, coupled with translation, rigid, affine, and B-spline transformations, designed to address these issues in 3D time-lapse microscopy images. In this method, features are detected as local intensity maxima in the source and target image stacks, and their similarity matrix is used as an input to the Hungarian algorithm to establish initial correspondences. Random Sampling Consensus algorithm is then employed to eliminate outliers. The resulting set of corresponding features is used to determine the optimal transformations. Accuracy of the proposed algorithm was tested on fluorescently labeled axons imaged over a 48-day period with a two-photon laser scanning microscope. For this, multiple axons in individual stacks of images were traced semi-manually in 3D, and the distances between the corresponding traces were measured before and after the registration. The results show that there is a progressive improvement in the registration accuracy with increasing complexity of the transformations. In particular, an accuracy of less than 1 voxel (0.26 m) was achieved with a regularized B-spline transformation. To illustrate the utility of the proposed method, registered images were used to automatically track synaptic boutons on axons over the entire duration of the experiment, yielding 99% precision and recall.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neuroimaging have allowed the use of network analysis to study the brain in a system-based approach. A system-based analysis of gliomas can shed light on mechanisms underlying neuronal connectivity and plasticity and the recovery process, and it could support surgical decision-making. Surgery has been shifting from image-guided surgery to a functional mapping-guided resection where several structural and functional modalities are used. However, reliable identification of eloquent areas during planning of surgical resection is still a challenge. Pre-operative language mapping performed by navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is of great value as it elucidates functional cortical organization, which might be different from patient to patient due to the heterogeneity of the lesions and individual plasticity. In this paper we propose the construction of an \\\"effective\\\" speech network used for surgical decision making. This is achieved by mapping functionally relevant areas identified by nTMS on tractography-based connectomics. Subsequently we compute graph metrics on the identified speech networks of patients who show preoperative aphasia aiming to identify relevant differences between graph metrics in patients with and without preoperative aphasia. Lastly, the validity of the speech networks is examined by checking the involved graph communities.",

We recorded LFPs from the motor thalamus, surface electromyographic (EMG) signals and/or behavioural measurements in seven ET patients during temporary lead externalization after the first surgery for DBS when they performed different voluntary upper limb movements and in nine more patients during the surgery, when they were asked to lift their arms to trigger postural tremor.

NAC TFs also play important roles in fruit ripening. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), one of the best characterized NAC involved in fruit ripening is NON-RIPENING (NOR) and the non-ripening (nor) mutation has been widely used to extend fruit shelf life in elite varieties. Here, we show that NOR additionally controls leaf senescence. Expression of NOR increases with leaf age, and developmental as well as dark-induced senescence are delayed in the nor mutant, while overexpression of NOR promotes leaf senescence. Genes associated with chlorophyll degradation as well as senescence-associated genes (SAGs) show reduced and elevated expression, respectively, in nor mutants and NOR overexpressors. Overexpression of NOR also stimulates leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana. In tomato, NOR supports senescence by directly and positively regulating the expression of several senescence-associated genes including, besides others, SlSAG15 and SlSAG113, SlSGR1 and SlYLS4. Finally, we find that another senescence control NAC TF, namely SlNAP2, acts upstream of NOR to regulate its expression. Our data support a model whereby NAC TFs have often been recruited by higher plants for both, the control of leaf senescence and fruit ripening.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent studies using batch-fermentation suggest that the red macroalgae Asparagopsis taxiformis might reduce methane (CH4) emission from beef cattle by up to ~99% when added to rhodes grass hay, a common feed in the Australian beef industry. These experiments have shown significant reductions in methane without compromising other fermentation parameters (i.e. volatile fatty acid production) with A. taxiformis organic matter (OM) inclusion rates of up to 5%. In the study presented here, A. taxiformis was evaluated for its ability to reduce methane production from dairy cattle fed a mixed ration widely utilized in California; the largest milk producer in the US.\\n\\nResultsFermentation in a semi-continuous in-vitro rumen system suggests that A. taxiformis can reduce methane production from enteric fermentation in dairy cattle by 95% when added at a 5% OM inclusion rate without any obvious negative impacts on volatile fatty acid production. High-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing showed that seaweed amendment effects rumen microbiome communities consistent with the Anna Karenina hypothesis, with increased beta-diversity, over time scales of approximately three days. The relative abundance of methanogens in the fermentation vessels amended with A. taxiformis decreased significantly compared to control vessels, but this reduction in methanogen abundance was only significant when averaged over the course of the experiment. Alternatively, significant reductions of methane in the A. taxiformis amended vessels was measured in the early stages of the experiment. This suggests that A. taxiformis has an immediate effect on the metabolic functionality of rumen methanogens whereas its impact on microbiome assemblage, specifically methanogen abundance, is delayed.\\n\\nConclusionsThe methane reducing effect of A. taxiformis during rumen fermentation makes this macroalgae a promising candidate as a biotic methane mitigation strategy in the largest milk producing state in the US. But its effect in-vivo (i.e. in dairy cattle) remains to be investigated in animal trials. Furthermore, to obtain a holistic understanding of the biochemistry responsible for the significant reduction of methane, gene expression profiles of the rumen microbiome and the host animal are warranted.",

To independently evaluate the effects of changes in expression mean and noise we determined the fitness landscapes in mean-noise expression space for 33 genes in yeast. The landscapes can be decomposed into two principal topologies: the fitness effects of protein shortage and surplus. For most genes, the fitness impact of sustained (mean) and short-lived (noise) deviations away from the expression optimum are linked and of similar magnitude. Sensitivity to both protein shortage and surplus creates a fitness landscape in which an  epistatic ratchet uncouples the evolution of noise from mean expression, promoting noise minimization. These results demonstrate that noise is detrimental for many genes and reveal non-trivial consequences of mean-noise-fitness topologies for the evolution of gene expression systems.\\n\\nHighlights- Expression fitness landscapes in mean-noise space allow quantitative independent assessment of the effects of noise and mean expression on fitness for 33 genes\\n- Landscapes are described by a combination of just two principal topologies: fitness defects due protein shortage, or due to protein surplus\\n- Direct evidence that high expression noise is detrimental to fitness for 50% of genes\\n- Mean expression and noise have equivalent impact on organismal fitness\\n- Landscapes created by sensitivities to protein shortage and surplus facilitate independent evolution of gene expression noise via an epistatic ratchet",

Extending this approach to more complex phenotypes has necessitated a massive increase in cohort size. To achieve sufficient power, participants are recruited across multiple collaborating institutions, leaving researchers with two choices: either collect all the raw data at a single institution or rely on meta-analyses to test for association. In this work, we present a third alternative. Here, we implement an entire GWAS workflow (quality control, population structure control, and association) in a fully decentralized setting. Our iterative approach (a) does not rely on consolidating the raw data at a single coordination center, and (b) does not hinge upon large sample size assumptions at each silo. As we show, our approach overcomes challenges faced by meta-studies when it comes to associating rare alleles and when case/control proportions are wildly imbalanced at each silo.

Although ecological speciation is a fundamental source of diversification, the mechanistic link between natural selection and reproductive isolation remains poorly understood, especially in natural populations2-6. Here we show that experimental evolution of parasite body size over four years (ca. 60 generations) leads to reproductive isolation in natural populations of feather lice on birds. When lice are transferred to pigeons of different sizes they rapidly evolve differences in body size that are correlated with host size. These size differences trigger mechanical mating isolation between lice that are locally adapted to the different sized hosts. Size differences among lice also influence the outcome of competition between males for access to females. Thus, body size directly mediates reproductive isolation through its influence on both inter-sexual compatibility and intra-sexual competition. Our results confirm that divergent natural selection acting on a single phenotypic trait can cause reproductive isolation to emerge from a single natural population in real time.",

A first comparison of reciprocal single chromosome substitutions revealed a dependency of QTL detection on different genetic backgrounds. The subsequent analysis of the complete panel of CSLs enabled the mapping of the genetic interactors and identified multiple two- and three-way interactions for different traits. Some of the detected epistatic effects were as large as any observed main effect, illustrating the impact of epistasis on quantitative trait variation.

Here, we employed single-particle electron microscopy based on XcpS (GspF) from the T2SS of pathogenic P. aeruginosa stabilized by a nanobody, to show that XcpS adopts a dimeric structure mediated by its transmembrane helices. This assembly matches in terms of overall organization and dimensions the basal inner-membrane cassette of a T2SS machinery. Thus, GspF is poised to serve as an adaptor involved in the mediation of propeller-like torque generated by the motor ATPase to the secretion pseudopilus.\\n\\nNon-technical author summaryAntibiotic resistance by bacteria imposes a worldwide threat that can only be overcome through a multi-front approach: preventive actions and the parallel development of novel molecular strategies to combat antibiotic resistance mechanisms. One such strategy might focus on antivirulence drugs that prevent host invasion and spreading by pathogenic bacteria, without shutting down essential functions related to bacterial survival. The rationale behind such an approach is that it might limit selective pressure leading to slower evolutionary rates of resistant bacterial strains. Bacterial secretion systems are an appropriate target for such therapeutic approaches as their impairment will inhibit the secretion of a multitude of virulence factors. This study focuses on the structural characterization of one of the proteins residing in the inner-membrane cassette of the type II secretion system (T2SS), a multi-protein complex in multiple opportunistic pathogens that secretes virulence factors. The targeted protein is essential for the assembly of the pseudopilus, a rod-like supramolecular structure that propels the secretion of virulence factors by pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. Our study crucially complements growing evidence supporting a rotational assembly model of the pseudopilus and contributes to a better understanding of the functioning of the T2SS and the related secretion systems. We envisage that such knowledge will facilitate targeting of these systems for therapeutic purposes.",

    "abstract": "Brucella, the causing agent of brucellosis, is a major zoonotic pathogen with worldwide distribution. Brucella resides and replicates inside infected host cells in membrane-bound compartments called BCVs (Brucella-containing vacuoles). Following uptake, Brucella resides in eBCVs (endosomal BCVs) that gradually mature from early to late endosomal features. Through a poorly understood process that is key to the intracellular lifestyle of Brucella, the eBCV escapes fusion with lysosomes by transitioning to the rBCV (replicative BCV), a replicative niche directly connected to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Despite the notion that this complex intracellular lifestyle must depend on a multitude of host factors, a holistic view on which of these components control Brucella cell entry, trafficking and replication is still missing. Here we used a systematic cell-based siRNA knockdown screen in HeLa cells infected with Brucella abortus and identified 425 components of the human infectome for Brucella infection. These include multiple components of pathways involved in central processes such as cell cycle, actin cytoskeleton dynamics or vesicular trafficking. Using assays for pathogen entry, knockdown complementation and co-localization at single-cell resolution, we identified the requirement of the VPS retromer for Brucella to escape the lysosomal degradative pathway and to establish its intracellular replicative niche. We thus validated a component of the VPS retromer as novel host factor critical for Brucella intracellular trafficking. Further, our genome-wide data shed light on the interplay between central host processes and the biogenesis of the Brucella replicative niche.\\n\\nImportanceWith >300,000 new cases of human brucellosis annually, Brucella is regarded as one of the most important zoonotic bacterial pathogen worldwide. The causing agent of brucellosis resides inside host cells within vacuoles termed Brucella containing vacuoles (BCVs). Although few host components required to escape the degradative lysosomal pathway and to establish the ER-derived replicative BCV (rBCV) have already been identified, the global understanding of this highly coordinated process is still partial and many factors remain unknown. To gain a deeper insight into these fundamental questions we performed a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen aiming at discovering novel host factors involved in the Brucella intracellular cycle. We identified 425 host proteins that contribute to Brucella cellular entry, intracellular trafficking, and replication. Together, this study sheds light on previously unknown host pathways required for the Brucella infection cycle and highlights the VPS retromer components as critical factors for the establishment of the Brucella intracellular replicative niche.",

    "abstract": "PurposeImage acceleration provides multiple benefits to diffusion MRI (dMRI), with in-plane acceleration reducing distortion and slice-wise acceleration increasing the number of directions that can be acquired in a given scan time. However, as acceleration factors increase, the reconstruction problem becomes ill-conditioned, particularly when using both in-plane acceleration and simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) imaging. In this work, we develop a novel reconstruction method for in-vivo MRI acquisition that provides acceleration beyond what conventional techniques can achieve.\\n\\nTheory and MethodsWe propose to constrain the reconstruction in the spatial (k) domain by incorporating information from the angular (q) domain. This approach exploits smoothness of the signal in q-space using Gaussian processes, as has previously been exploited in post-reconstruction analysis. We demonstrate in-plane acceleration exceeding the theoretical parallel imaging limits, and SMS combined with in-plane acceleration at a total factor of 12. This reconstruction is cast within a Bayesian framework that incorporates estimation of smoothness hyper-parameters, with no need for manual tuning.\\n\\nResultsSimulations and in vivo results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method compared with conventional parallel imaging methods. These improvements are achieved without loss of spatial or angular resolution and require only a minor modification to standard pulse sequences.\\n\\nConclusionThe proposed method provides improvements over existing methods for diffusion acceleration, particularly for high SMS acceleration with in-plane undersampling.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructions of evolutionary and historical biogeographic processes can improve our understanding of how species ssemblages developed and permit inference of ecological drivers affecting coexistence. We explore this approach in Austrolebias, a genus of annual fishes possessing a wide range of body sizes. Regional assemblages composed of different species with similar size distributions are found in four areas of eastern South America. Using phylogenetic trees, species distribution models and size data we show how trait evolution and historical biogeography have affected the composition of species assemblages. We extend age-range correlations to improve estimates of local historical biogeography. We find that size variation principally arose in a single area and infer that ecological interactions drove size divergence. This large-size lineage spread to two other areas. One of these assemblages was likely shaped by adaptation to a new environment, but this was not associated with additional size divergence. We found only weak evidence that environmental filtering has been important in the construction of the remaining assemblage with the smallest range of sizes. The repeated assemblage structures were the result of different evolutionary and historical processes. Our approach sheds light on how species assemblages were built when typical clustering approaches may fall short.",

    "abstract": "All living cells must deal with protein aggregation, which can occur as a result of experiencing stress. In the bacteria Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium smegmatis, aggregates collect at the cell poles and are retained over consecutive cell divisions only in the daughter cell that inherits the old pole, resulting in aggregation-free progeny within a few generations. Here we have studied the in vivo kinetics of aggregate formation and clearance following heat and antibiotic stress in Caulobacter crescentus, which divides by a pre-programmed asymmetric cell cycle. Unexpectedly, we find that aggregates do not preferentially collect at the cell poles, but form as multiple distributed foci throughout the cell volume. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that under moderate stress, the majority of protein aggregates are short-lived and rapidly dissolved by the major chaperone DnaK and the disaggregase ClpB. Severe stress or genetic perturbation of the protein quality machinery results in long-lived protein aggregates, which individual cells can only clear by passing on to their progeny. Importantly, these persistent aggregates are neither collected at the old pole over multiple generations nor inherited exclusively by the old pole-inheriting stalked cell, but instead are partitioned between both daughter cells during successive division events in the same ratio. Our data indicate that this symmetric mode of aggregate inheritance is driven by the elongation and division of the growing mother cell. In conclusion, our study revealed a new pattern of aggregate inheritance in bacteria.",

Here we look at variation in wild-collected samples of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and their relationships with bacterial symbionts, Burkholderia hayleyella and Burkholderia agricolaris. Only about a third of field-collected amoebae carry a symbiont. We cured and cross-infected D. discoideum hosts with different symbiont association histories and then compared the responses of the amoebae to each symbiont type. Before curing, field-collected clones did not vary significantly in overall fitness, but infected hosts produced morphologically different multicellular structures. After curing and re-infecting, host fitness declined overall. However, natural B. hayleyella hosts suffered fewer fitness costs when re-infected with B. hayleyella, indicating that they have evolved mechanisms to tolerate their naturally acquired symbiont. Exploring relationships between endosymbionts and hosts that vary within species may also reveal much about disease dynamics.",

    "abstract": "In guppies (Poecilia reticulata), a small number of individuals break away from a shoal and approach a potential predator, a behavior termed \"predator inspection\". These animals often employ a \"conditional approach\" strategy, in which an individual approaches the predator in the first move and subsequently approaches it only if a second individual swims even with it during inspection. This strategy is analogous to the \"tit-for-tat\" strategy of the Prisoners Dilemma, suggesting that it could be used to study cooperation. Serotonin is thought to mediate cooperative behavior in other fish species. Exposure to the animated image of a predator in a tank that contained a parallel mirror - mimicking an equally cooperating conspecific - promoted inspection and decreased refuge use, but increased freezing, suggesting that conditional approach is also associated with fear. To understand whether serotonin participates in conditional approach in guppies, we treated animals with either vehicle (Cortlands salt solution), fluoxetine (2.5 mg/kg) or metergoline (1 mg/kg), and tested then in a predator inspection paradigm. Fluoxetine increased the time the animal spent inspecting the predator image, while metergoline decreased it. Fluoxetine also decreased time spent avoiding the predator and increased freezing, while metergoline decreased freezing. These results suggest that phasic increases in serotonin levels promote conditional approach, suggesting a role for this neurotransmitter in cooperation.\n\nPreprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/436345; Data and scripts: https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/TFT",

    "abstract": "In the genus Cryptococcus, C. neoformans and C. gattii stand out by the number of virulence factors that allowed those fungi to achieve evolutionary success as pathogens. Among the factors contributing to cryptococcosis is a peculiar morphological transition to form giant (Titan) cells. Formation of Titans has been described in vitro. However, it remains unclear whether non-C. neoformans/non-C. gattii species are capable of titanisation. Based on a survey of several basidiomycetous yeasts, we propose that titanisation is unique to C. neoformans and C. gattii. In addition, we find that under in vitro conditions that induce titanisation, fetal bovine serum (FBS) possesses activity that inhibits growth of C. gattii and kills C. neoformans if incubation is conducted in the absence of 5% CO2. Moreover, lowering of pH or addition of an antioxidant, rescues growth in the presence of FBS and allows titanisation even in the absence of 5% CO2. Strikingly, acapsular mutants, cap10{Delta} and cap59{Delta}, show complete or partial reduction of titanisation, respectively and a partial resistance to growth inhibition imposed by the FBS. Our data implicate titanisation as a unique feature of C. neoformans and C. gattii and provide novel insights about the nature of this unusual morphological transition.",

    "abstract": "Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are members of the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF) that transport protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, thereby uncoupling electron transport from ATP synthesis. The stoichiometry of UCPs, and the possibility of co-existence of this protein as mono-meric and associated forms in lipid membranes remain an intriguing open question. In the current study, the tertiary structure of UCP2 was analyzed both experimentally and through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. After recombinant expression of UCP2 in the inner membrane of E. coli, the protein was directly extracted from the bacterial membranes with a non-denaturing detergent and purified both as a pure monomer and as a mixture of monomers, dimers and tetramers. Both protein preparations were re-constituted in egg yolk lipid vesicles. Gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism spectroscopy and fluorescence methods were used to characterize the structure and the proton transport function of protein. UCP2 showed unique stable tetrameric forms in lipid bilayers. MD simulations using membrane lipids and principal component analysis support the experimental results and provided new molecular insights into the nature of noncovalent interactions in oligomeric UCP2. MD simulations indicate that UCP2 tetramers are asymmetric dimers of dimers, in which the interactions between the monomers forming the dimer are stronger than the interactions between the dimers within the tetramer. It is also shown that UCP2 has a specific tendency to form functional tetramers in lipid bilayers, capable of proton transport. The asymmetric nature of the UCP2 tetramer could act as a scaffold for regulating the activity of the monomeric units through cooperative intercommunication between these subunits. Under similar experimental conditions, the structurally comparable ADP/ATP carrier protein did not form tetramers in vesicles, implying that spontaneous tetramerization cannot be generalized to all MCF members.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCESelf-assembly of membrane proteins plays a significant role in their biological function. In this article, both experimental and computational evidence are provided for spontaneous tetramerization of one of the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCP2) in model lipid membranes. It is also shown that the tetrameric form of UCP2 is capable of proton transport, which leads to regulation of ATP synthesis in mitochondrion. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the presence of asymmetric UCP2 tetramers as a potential scaffold for regulating the activity of the monomeric units through mutual intercommunication. The outcome of this study provides a solid ground for potential co-existence of monomeric and multimeric functional forms of UCPs that contributes to a deeper molecular insight into their structure and function.",
