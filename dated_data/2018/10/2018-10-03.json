    "abstract": "The Toxoplasma centrosome is a unique bipartite structure comprising an inner- and outer-core responsible for the nuclear cycle (mitosis) and budding cycles (cytokinesis), respectively. These two cores remain associated during the cell cycle but have been proposed to function independently. Here, we describe the function of a large coiled-coil protein, TgCep250, in connecting the two centrosomal cores and promoting their structural integrity. Throughout the cell cycle TgCep250 localizes to the centrosome inner-core but resides on both inner- and outer-cores during the onset of cell division. This dynamic localization pattern is associated with proteolysis: the processed version residing on the inner-core. In the absence of TgCep250, stray centrosome inner- and outer-core foci were observed; detachment of the inner-outer-core connection resulted in nuclear partitioning defects. The detachment between centrosome inner- and outer-core was found in only one of the centrosomes during cell division, indicating distinct states of mother and daughter centrosomes. We further dissected the hierarchical organization of centrosome and kinetochore complex through depletion of kinetochore component TgNuf2, which resulted in dissociation of the intact bipolar centrosome from the nuclear periphery. Together, these data suggest that TgCep250 bridges the interaction between the centrosome cores but not between the inner-core and kinetochore.\\n\\nShort SummaryThe opportunistic apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii uses a bipartite centrosome to independently regulate mitosis and cytokinesis. Here we report a large coiled-coil protein that functions to integrate the two centrosomal cores for faithful cell division. This study also reveals the layered structural organization of the centrosome/kinetochore complex.",

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing significance of sense of agency (SoA) research, the literature lacks a formal model: what computational principles underlie SoA, the registration that oneself initiated an action that caused something to happen? We theorize SoA in the framework of optimal Bayesian cue integration with mutually involved principles, namely, reliability of action and outcome sensory signals, their consistency with the causation of the outcome by the action, and the prior belief in causation. We used our Bayesian model to explain the intentional binding effect, hailed as reliable indicator of SoA. Our model explains temporal binding in both self-intended and unintentional actions suggesting that intentionality is not strictly necessary given high confidence in the action causing the outcome. Our Bayesian model also explains that if the sensory cues are reliable, SoA can emerge even for unintended actions. Our formal model therefore posits a precision-dependent causal agency.",

    "abstract": "Humans achieve their goals in joint action tasks either by cooperation or competition. In the present study, we investigated the neural processes underpinning error and monetary rewards processing in such cooperative and competitive situations. We used electroencephalography (EEG) and analyzed event-related potentials (ERPs) triggered by feedback in both social situations. 26 dyads performed a joint four-alternative forced choice (4AFC) visual task either cooperatively or competitively. At the end of each trial, participants received performance feedback about their individual and joint errors and accompanying monetary rewards. Furthermore, the outcome, i.e. resulting positive, negative or neutral rewards, was dependent on the pay-off matrix, defining the social situation either as cooperative or competitive. We used linear mixed effects models to analyze the feedback-related-negativity (FRN) and used the Thresholdfree cluster enhancement (TFCE) method to explore activations of all electrodes and times. We found main effects of the outcome and social situation at mid-line frontal electrodes. The FRN was more negative for losses than wins in both social situations. However, the FRN amplitudes differed between social situations. Moreover, we compared monetary with neutral outcomes in both social situations. Our exploratory TFCE analysis revealed that processing of feedback differs between cooperative and competitive situations at right temporo-parietal electrodes where the cooperative situation elicited more positive amplitudes. Further, the differences induced by the social situations were stronger in participants with higher scores on a perspective taking test. In sum, our results replicate previous studies about the FRN and extend them by comparing neurophysiological responses to positive and negative outcomes in a task that simultaneously engages two participants in competitive and cooperative situations.",

    "abstract": "Social behavior and neuronal connectivity in rodents have been shown to be shaped by the prototypical T lymphocyte-derived pro-inflammatory cytokine Interferon-gamma (IFN{gamma}). It has also been demonstrated that STAT1 (Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription 1), a transcription factor (TF) crucially involved in the IFN{gamma} pathway, binds consensus sequences that, in humans, are located with a high frequency in the LTRs (Long Terminal Repeats) of the MER41 family of primate-specific HERVs (Human Endogenous Retrovirus). However, the putative role of an IFN{gamma}/STAT1/MER41 pathway in human cognition and/or behavior is still poorly documented. Here, we present evidence that the promoter regions of intellectual disability-associated genes are uniquely enriched in LTR sequences of the MER41 HERVs. This observation is specific to MER41 among more than 130 HERVs examined. Moreover, we have not found such a significant enrichment in the promoter regions of genes that associate with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or schizophrenia. Interestingly, ID-associated genes exhibit promoter-localized MER41 LTRs that harbor TF binding sites (TFBSs) for not only STAT1 but also other immune TFs such as, in particular, NFKB1 (Nuclear Factor Kappa B Subunit 1) and STAT3 (Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription 3). Moreover, IL-6 (Interleukin 6) rather than IFN{gamma}, is identified as the main candidate cytokine regulating such an immune/MER41/cognition pathway. Of note, functionally-relevant differences between humans and chimpanzees are observed regarding the 3 main components of this pathway: i) the protein sequences of immunes TFs binding MER41 LTRs, ii) the insertion sites of MER41 LTRs in the promoter regions of ID-associated genes and iii) the protein sequences of the targeted ID-associated genes. Finally, a survey of the human proteome has allowed us to map a protein-protein network which links the identified immune/MER41/cognition pathway to FOXP2 (Forkhead Box P2), a key TF involved in the emergence of human speech. Together, these results suggest that the stepped self-domestication of MER41 in the genomes of primates could have been a driver of cognitive evolution. Our data further indicate that non-inherited forms of ID might result from alterations of the immune/MER41/cognition pathway induced notably by the untimely or quantitatively inappropriate exposure of human neurons to IL-6.",

For large sample size, limma based on transformed data by using the 8 proposed transformation methods had similar performance to limma based on transformed data by using existing transformation methods for equal library size scenarios. Otherwise, limma based on transformed data by using the rv, lv, rv2, or lv2 transformation, or by using the existing voom transformation performed better than limma based on data from other transformation methods.

    "abstract": "Modern medicine is rapidly moving towards a data-driven paradigm based on comprehensive multimodal health assessments. We collected 1,385 data features from diverse modalities, including metabolome, microbiome, genetics and advanced imaging, from 1,253 individuals and from a longitudinal validation cohort of 1,083 individuals. We utilized an ensemble of unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify multimodal biomarker signatures of health and disease risk. In particular, our method identified a set of cardiometabolic biomarkers that goes beyond standard clinical biomarkers, which were used to cluster individuals into distinct health profiles. Cluster membership was a better predictor for diabetes than established clinical biomarkers such as glucose, insulin resistance, and BMI. The novel biomarkers in the diabetes signature included 1-stearoyl-2-dihomo-linolenoyl-GPC and 1-(1-enyl-palmitoyl)-2-oleoyl-GPC. Another metabolite, cinnamoylglycine, was identified as a potential biomarker for both gut microbiome health and lean mass percentage. We also identified an early disease signature for hypertension, and individuals at-risk for a poor metabolic health outcome. We found novel associations between an uremic toxin, p-cresol sulfate, and the abundance of the microbiome genera Intestinimonas and an unclassified genus in the Erysipelotrichaceae family. Our methodology and results demonstrate the potential of multimodal data integration, from the identification of novel biomarker signatures to a data-driven stratification of individuals into disease subtypes and stages -- an essential step towards personalized, preventative health risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "Diverse communities can adjust their trait composition to altered environmental conditions, which may strongly influence their dynamics. Previous studies of trait-based models mainly considered only one or two trophic levels, whereas most natural system are at least tritrophic. Therefore, we investigated how the addition of trait variation to each trophic level influences population and community dynamics in a tritrophic model. Examining the phase relationships between species of adjacent trophic levels informs about the degree of top-down or bottom-up control in non-steady-state situations. Phase relationships within a trophic level highlight compensatory dynamical patterns between functionally different species, which are responsible for dampening the community temporal variability. Furthermore, even without trait variation, our tritrophic model always exhibits regions with two alternative states with either weak or strong nutrient exploitation, and correspondingly low or high biomass production at the top level. However, adding trait variation increased the basin of attraction of the high-production state, and decreased the likelihood of a critical transition from the high-to the low-production state with no apparent early warning signals. Hence, our study shows that trait variation enhances resource use efficiency, production, variability, and resilience of entire food webs.",

Using an epigenomic deconvolution approach we performed cell-type-specific methylome-wide association studies (MWAS) within sub-populations of neurons/glia and granulocytes/T-cells/B-cells/monocytes for bulk brain and blood data, respectively. Multiple MWAS findings in neurons/glia replicated across brain collections (ORs=509-538, P-values<1x10-5) and were reproducible in an array-based MWAS of sorted neurons/glia from a fourth brain collection (N=58). Pathway analyses implicated p75NTR/VEGF signaling, neurodegeneration, and blood-brain barrier perturbation. Cell-type-specific analysis in blood identified associations in CD14+ monocytes -- a cell type strongly linked to neuroimmune processes and stress. Top results in neurons/glia/bulk and monocytes were enriched for genes supported by GWAS for MDD (ORs=2.02-2.87, P-values=0.003 to <1x10-5), neurodegeneration and other psychiatric disorders.

We isolated and sequenced 431 E. coli (including 155 ESBL-producing isolates) from cross-sectional surveys of livestock farms and retail meat in the East of England. These were compared with the genomes of 1517 E. coli associated with bloodstream infection in the United Kingdom. Phylogenetic core genome comparisons demonstrated that livestock and patient isolates were genetically distinct, indicating that E. coli causing serious human infection do not directly originate from livestock. By contrast, we observed highly related isolates from the same animal species on different farms. Analysis of accessory (variable) genomes identified a virulence cassette associated previously with cystitis and neonatal meningitis that was only present in isolates from humans. Screening all 1948 isolates for accessory genes encoding antibiotic resistance revealed 41 different genes present in variable proportions of humans and livestock isolates. We identified a low prevalence of shared antimicrobial resistance genes between livestock and humans based on analysis of mobile genetic elements and long-read sequencing. We conclude that in this setting, there was limited evidence to support the suggestion that antimicrobial resistant pathogens that cause serious infection in humans originate from livestock.\\n\\nImportanceThe increasing prevalence of E. coli bloodstream infections is a serious public health problem.

We analyzed HERV transcriptome with microarray data from whole blood samples of a burn cohort (n=30), a trauma cohort (n=105) and 2 septic shock cohorts (n=28, n=51), and healthy volunteers (HV, n=60). We described expression of the 337 probesets targeting HERV from U133 plus 2.0 microarray in each dataset and then we compared HERVs transcriptional modulation of patients compared to healthy volunteers. Although all 4 cohorts contained very severe patients, the majority of the 337 HERVs was not expressed (around 74% in mean). Each cohort had differentially expressed probesets in patients compared to HV (from 19 to 46). Strikingly, 5 HERVs were in common in all types of severely injured patients, with 4 being up-modulated in patients. We highlighted co-expressed profiles between HERV and nearby gene as well as autonomous HERV expression. We suggest an inflammatory-specific HERV transcriptional response, and importantly, we introduce that the HERVs close to immunity-related genes might have a role on its expression.",

We present a system of open source hardware and software for fiber photometry data acquisition consisting of a compact, low cost, data acquisition board built around the Micropython microcontroller, and a cross platform graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling acquisition and visualising signals. The system can acquire two analog and two digital signals, and control two external LEDs via built in LED drivers. Time-division multiplexed illumination allows independent readout of fluorescence evoked by different excitation wavelengths from a single photoreceiver signal. Validation experiments indicate this approach offers better signal to noise for a given average excitation light intensity than sinusoidally-modulated illumination. pyPhotometry is substantially cheaper than commercial hardware filling the same role, and we anticipate, as an open source and comparatively simple tool, it will be easily adaptable and therefore of broad interest to a wide range of users.",

    "abstract": "Whereas the majority of mammalian species are uni-parental with the mother solely provisioning care for young conspecifics, fathering behaviors can emerge under certain circumstances. For example, a great deal of individual variation in response to young pups has been reported in multiple inbred strains of laboratory male mice. Further, sexual experience and subsequent cohabitation with a female conspecific can induce caregiving responses in otherwise indifferent, fearful or aggressive males. Thus, a highly conserved parental neural circuit is likely present in both sexes, however the extent to which infants are capable of accessing this circuit may vary. In support of this idea, fearful or indifferent responses toward pups in female mice are linked to greater immediate early gene (IEG) expression in a fear/defensive circuit involving the anterior hypothalamus than in an approach/attraction circuit involving the ventral tegmental area. However, experience with infants, particularly in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) treatment, can reverse this pattern of neuronal activation and behavior. Thus, HDACi treatment may increase the transcription of primed/poised genes that play a role in the activation and selection of a maternal approach circuit in response to pup stimuli. Here, we asked whether HDACi treatment would impact behavioral response selection and associated IEG expression changes in virgin male mice that are capable of ignoring, attacking or caring for pups. Our results indicate that systemic HDACi treatment induces spontaneous caregiving behavior in non-aggressive male mice and alters the pattern of pup-induced IEG expression across a fear/defensive neural circuit.",

    "abstract": "Both phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and beta-bursts in the subthalamic nucleus have been significantly linked to symptom severity in Parkinsons disease (PD) in humans and emerged independently as competing biomarkers for closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS). However, the underlying nature of subthalamic PAC is poorly understood and its relationship with transient beta burst-events has not been investigated. To address this, we studied macro- and micro electrode recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) and single unit activity from 15 hemispheres in 10 PD patients undergoing DBS surgery. PAC between beta phase and high frequency oscillation (HFO) amplitude was compared to single unit firing rates, spike triggered averages, power spectral densities and phase-spike locking, and was studied in periods of beta-bursting. We found a significant synchronisation of spiking to HFOs and correlation of mean firing rates with HFO-amplitude when the latter was coupled to beta phase (i.e. in the presence of PAC). In the presence of PAC, single unit power spectra displayed peaks in the beta and HFO frequency range and the HFO frequency was correlated with that in the LFP. Finally, PAC significantly increased with beta burst-duration. Our findings offer new insight in the pathology of Parkinsons disease by providing evidence that subthalamic PAC reflects the locking of spiking activity to network beta oscillations and that this coupling progressively increases with beta-burst duration. These findings suggest that beta-bursts capture periods of increased subthalamic input/output synchronisation in the beta frequency range and have important implications for therapeutic closed-loop DBS.\\n\\nSignificance statementIdentifying biomarkers for closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become an increasingly important issue in Parkinsons Disease (PD) research. Two such biomarkers, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and beta-bursts, recorded from the implanted electrodes in subthalamic nucleus in PD patients, correlate with motor impairment. However, the physiological basis of PAC, and it relationship to beta bursts, is unclear. We provide multiple lines of evidence that PAC in the human STN reflects the locking of spiking activity to network beta oscillations and that this coupling progressively increases with the duration of beta-bursts. This suggests that beta-bursts capture increased subthalamic input/output synchronisation and provides new insights in PD pathology with direct implications for closed-loop DBS therapy strategies.",

    "abstract": "How do humans search for rewards? This question is commonly studied using multi-armed bandit tasks, which require participants to trade off exploration and exploitation. Standard multi-armed bandits assume that each option has an independent reward distribution. However, learning about options independently is unrealistic, since in the real world options often share an underlying structure. We study a class of structured bandit tasks, which we use to probe how generalization guides exploration. In a structured multi-armed bandit, options have a correlation structure dictated by a latent function. We focus on bandits in which rewards are linear functions of an options spatial position. Across 5 experiments, we find evidence that participants utilize functional structure to guide their exploration, and also exhibit a learning-to-learn effect across rounds, becoming progressively faster at identifying the latent function. Our experiments rule out several heuristic explanations and show that the same findings obtain with non-linear functions. Comparing several models of learning and decision making, we find that the best model of human behavior in our tasks combines three computational mechanisms: (1) function learning, (2) clustering of reward distributions across rounds, and (3) uncertainty-guided exploration. Our results suggest that human reinforcement learning can utilize latent structure in sophisticated ways to improve efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Protein model quality assessment (QA) is a crucial and yet open problem in structural bioinformatics. The current best methods for single-model QA typically combine results from different approaches, each based on different input features constructed by experts in the field. Then, the prediction model is trained using a machine-learning algorithm. Recently, with the development of convolutional neural networks (CNN), the training paradigm has changed. In computer vision, the expert-developed features have been significantly overpassed by automatically trained convolutional filters. This motivated us to apply a three-dimensional (3D) CNN to the problem of protein model QA.\\n\\nWe developed a novel method for single-model QA called Ornate. Ornate (Oriented Routed Neural network with Automatic Typing) is a residue-wise scoring function that takes as input 3D density maps. It predicts the local (residue-wise) and the global model quality through a deep 3D CNN. Specifically, Ornate aligns the input density map, corresponding to each residue and its neighborhood, with the backbone topology of this residue. This circumvents the problem of ambiguous orientations of the initial models. Also, Ornate includes automatic identification of atom types and dynamic routing of the data in the network. Established benchmarks (CASP 11 and CASP 12) demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach among singlemodel QA methods.\\n\\nThe method is available at https://team.inria.fr/nanod/software/Ornate/. It consists of a C++ executable that transforms molecular structures into volumetric density maps, and a Python code based on the TensorFlow framework for applying the Ornate model to these maps.",

Often, the data is exchanged and stored as aligned reads, which provides high compression and convenient access for many analyses. However, aligned data becomes outdated as new reference genomes and alignment methods become available. Moreover, some applications cannot utilise pre-aligned reads at all, necessitating conversion back to raw format (FASTQ) before they can be used. In both cases, the process of extraction and realignment is expensive and time consuming.\\n\\nFindingsWe describe Bazam, a tool that efficiently extracts the original paired FASTQ from reads stored in aligned form (BAM or CRAM format). Bazam extracts reads in a format that directly allows realignment with popular aligners with high concurrency. Through eliminating steps and increasing the accessible concurrency, Bazam facilitates up to a 90% reduction in the time required for realignment compared to standard methods. Bazam can support selective extraction of read pairs from focused genomic regions, further increasing efficiency for targeted analyses. Bazam is additionally suitable as a base for other applications that require efficient paired read information, such as quality control, structural variant calling and alignment comparison.\\n\\nConclusionsBazam offers significant improvements for users needing to realign genomic data.",

In many studies, principal component analysis (PCA) is the clustering algorithm of choice to predict the relationship of samples or cells based solely on differential gene expression. In addition to the pure quality evaluation of the data, a PCA can also provide initial insights into the biological background of an experiment and help researchers to interpret the data and design the subsequent computational steps accordingly. However, to avoid misleading clusterings and interpretations, an appropriate selection of the underlying gene sets to build the PCA and the choice of the most fitting principal components for the visualization are crucial parts.

    "abstract": "Pervasive transcription is a widespread phenomenon leading to the production of a plethora of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) without apparent function. Pervasive transcription poses a risk that needs to be controlled to prevent the perturbation of gene expression. In yeast, the highly conserved helicase Sen1 restricts pervasive transcription by inducing termination of non-coding transcription. However, the mechanisms underlying the specific function of Sen1 at ncRNAs are poorly understood. Here we identify a motif in an intrinsically disordered region of Sen1 that mimics the phosphorylated carboxy terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II and characterize structurally its recognition by the CTD-interacting domain of Nrd1, an RNA-binding protein that binds specific sequences in ncRNAs. In addition, we show that Sen1-dependent termination strictly requires the recognition of the CTD by the N-terminal domain of Sen1. We provide evidence that the Sen1-CTD interaction does not promote Sen1 initial recruitment but rather the capacity of Sen1 to induce the release of paused RNAPII from the DNA. Our results shed light onto the network of protein-protein interactions that control termination of non-coding transcription by Sen1.",

For this reason, an analysis of the effects of genetic variation on gene expression and DNA methylation in human placentas at high resolution and whole-genome coverage will have multiple mechanistic and practical implications.\\n\\nResultsBy producing and analyzing DNA sequence variation (n=303), DNA methylation (n=303) and mRNA expression data (n=80) from placentas from healthy women, we investigate the regulatory landscape of the human placenta and offer analytical approaches to integrate different types of genomic data and address some potential limitations of current platforms. We distinguish two profiles of interaction between expression and DNA methylation, revealing linear or bimodal effects, reflecting differences in genomic context, transcription factor recruitment, and possibly cell subpopulations.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings help to clarify the interactions of genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in normal human placentas. They also provide strong evidence for genotype-driven modifications of transcription and DNA methylation in normal placentas. In addition to these mechanistic implications, the data and analytical methods presented here will improve the interpretability of genome-wide and epigenome-wide association studies for human traits and diseases that involve placental functions.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe placenta is a critical organ playing multiple roles including oxygen and metabolite transfer from mother to fetus, hormone production, and vascular perfusion. With this study, we aimed to deliver a placenta-specific regulatory map based on a combination of publicly available and newly generated data. To complete this reference, we obtained genotype information (n=303), DNA methylation (n=303) and expression data (n=80) for placentas from healthy women. Our analysis of methylation and expression quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and correlations between methylation and expression data were designed to identify fundamental associations between genome, transcriptome, and epigenome in this key fetal organ. The results provide high-resolution genetic and epigenetic maps specific to the placenta based on a representative ethnically diverse cohort. As interest and efforts are growing to better understand the etiology of placental disease and the impact of the environment on placental function these data will provide a reference and enhance future investigations.",

While the effects of GSR on resting-state functional connectivity measures have received much attention, there has been relatively little attention devoted to its effects on studies looking at the relation between resting-state BOLD measures and independent measures of brain activity. In this study we used simultaneously acquired EEG-fMRI data in humans to examine the effects of GSR on the correlation between resting-state BOLD fluctuations and EEG vigilance measures. We show that GSR leads to a positive shift in the correlation between the BOLD and vigilance measures. This shift leads to a reduction in the spatial extent of negative correlations in widespread brain areas, including the visual cortex, but leads to the appearance of positive correlations in other areas, such as the cingulate gyrus. The results obtained using GSR are consistent with those of a temporal censoring process in which the correlation is computed using a temporal subset of the data. Since the data from these retained time points are unaffected by the censoring process, this finding suggests that the positive correlations in cingulate gyrus are not simply an artifact of GSR.",

Although IPMK non-catalytic functions are well established, it is less clear if the disordered domains are important for IPMK kinase activity or ATP binding. Here, kinetic and structural analyses of an engineered human IPMK lacking all disordered domains ({Delta}IPMK) are presented. Although the KM for PIP2 is identical between {Delta}IPMK and wild type, {Delta}IPMK has a 1.8-fold increase in kcat for PIP2, indicating the native IPMK disordered domains decrease IPMK activity in vitro. The 2.5 [A] crystal structure of {Delta}IPMK is reported, confirming the conserved ATP-grasp fold. A comparison with other IPK-superfamily structures revealed a putative \\\"ATP-clamp\\\" in the disordered N-terminus, we predicted would stabilize ATP binding. Consistent with this observation, removal of the ATP clamp sequence increases the KM for ATP 4.9-fold, indicating the N-terminus enhances ATP binding to IPMK.

We extracted LAB as it is GRAS (Generally Recognised As Safe) and is abundantly present in probiotics like curd. After extraction of LAB colonies and were tested for its effect on foods rich in acrylamide content. Acrylamide formation is studied by the maillard reaction. Acrylamide is found in food products which have been subjected to very high temperatures. The application of LAB to remove many mutagens, by using the binding mechanism was assessed for acrylamide. When this acrylamide degrades it produces toxic gases like ammonia, hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Asparagine is an important precursor to acrylamide formation. So in foods containing free asparagine group with reducing sugars will form acrylamide. We used liquid chromatography to determine the presence of acrylamide in the food product. Acrylamide content in the body is responsible for various mutations at the genomic level thereby, leading to cancers like colon, breast. It also leads to neural damages and is directly linked to Alzhimers disease. This study concludes the beneficial effects of consuming probiotics and suggests a way to reduce the acrylamide formation in food products.",

    "abstract": "O_LICluster analysis plays vital role in pattern recognition in several fields of science. Silhouette width is a widely used measure for assessing the fit of individual objects in the classification, as well as the quality of clusters and the entire classification. This index uses two clustering criteria, compactness (average within-cluster distances) and separation (average between-cluster distances), which implies that spherical cluster shapes are preferred over others - a property that can be seen as a disadvantage in the presence 22 of clusters with high internal heterogeneity, which is common in real situations.\\nC_LIO_LIWe suggest a generalization of the silhouette width using the generalized mean. By changing the p parameter of the generalized mean between -{infty} and +{infty}, several specific summary statistics, including the minimum, maximum, the arithmetic, harmonic, and geometric means, can be reproduced. Implementing the generalized mean in the calculation of silhouette width allows for changing the sensitivity of the index to compactness vs. connectedness. With higher sensitivity to connectedness instead of compactness the preference of silhouette width towards spherical clusters is expected to reduce. We test the performance of the generalized silhouette width on artificial data sets and on the Iris data set. We examine how classifications with different numbers of clusters prepared by single linkage, group average, and complete linkage algorithms are evaluated, if p is set to different values.\\nC_LIO_LIWhen p was negative, well separated clusters achieved high silhouette widths despite their elongated or circular shapes. Positive values of p increased the importance of compactness, hence the preference towards spherical clusters became even more detectable. With low p, single linkage clustering was deemed the most efficient clustering method, while with higher parameter values the performance of group average and complete linkage seemed better.\\nC_LIO_LIThe generalized silhouette width is a promising tool for assessing clustering quality. It allows for adjusting the contribution of compactness and connectedness criteria to the index value, thus avoiding underestimation of clustering efficiency in the presence of clusters with high internal heterogeneity.\\nC_LI",

High-density emitter localization combined with a large field of view and fast imaging frame rate is commonly used to achieve a high imaging throughput, but the image processing speed in the dense emitter scenario remains a bottleneck. Here we present a simple non-iterative approach, referred to as WindSTORM, to achieve high-speed high-density emitter localization with robust performance for various image characteristics. We demonstrate that WindSTORM improves the computation speed by two orders of magnitude on CPU and three orders of magnitude upon GPU acceleration to realize online image processing, without compromising localization accuracy. Further, due to the embedded background correction, WindSTORM is highly robust in the presence of high and non-uniform background. WindSTORM paves the way for next generation of high-throughput nanoscopy.",

Nutrients (sulphate, ammonium, nitrite and nitrate) levels, organic matter (OM) and carbon content were higher at Zone B of mangrove ecosystem due to the higher OM content from mangrove leaf litter decomposition and microbial degradation.

    "abstract": "Pyrimethamine resistance is a major concern for the control of human haemoprotozoa, especially Plasmodium species. Currently, there is little understanding of how pyrimethamine resistance developed in Plasmodium vivax in the natural field conditions. Here, we present first time the evidence of positive selection pressure on a dihydrofolate reductase locus and its consequences on the emergence and the spread of pyrimethamine resistance in P. vivax in the Punjab province of Pakistan. First, we examined the pyrimethamine resistance locus in 38 P. vivax populations to look for evidence of positive selection pressure in human patients. The S58R (AGA)/S117N (AAC) double mutation was most common, being detected in 10/38 populations. Single mutation S117N (AAC), I173L (CTT) and S58R (AGA) SNPs were detected in 8/38, 2/38 and 1/38 populations, respectively. The F57L/I (TTA/ATA) and T61M (ATG) SNPs were not detected in any population examined. Although both soft and hard selective sweeps have occurred with striking differences between populations, there was a predominance of hard sweeps. A single resistance haplotype was present at high frequency in 9/14 populations, providing a strong evidence for the single emergence of these mutations. In contrast, 5/14 populations carried multiple resistance haplotypes at high frequencies, providing an evidence of the emergence of resistance by recurrent mutations, characteristics of soft selective sweeps. Our phylogenetic relationship analysis suggests that S58R (AGA)/S117N (AAC) and S117N (AAC) mutations arose multiple times from a single origin and spread to multiple different cities in the Punjab province through gene flow. Interestingly, the I173L (CTT) mutation was present on a single haplotype, suggesting that it arises rarely and has not spread between cities. Our work shows the need for responsible use of exiting and new antimicrobial drugs and their combinations, control the movement of infected patients and mosquito vector control strategies.",

    "abstract": "Visual performance depends on polar angle, even when eccentricity is held constant; on many psychophysical tasks observers perform best when stimuli are presented on the horizontal meridian, worst on the upper vertical, and intermediate on the lower vertical meridian. This variation in performance  around the visual field can be as pronounced as that of doubling the stimulus eccentricity. The causes of these asymmetries in performance are largely unknown. Some factors in the eye, e.g. cone density, are positively correlated with the reported variations in visual performance with polar angle. However, the question remains whether such correlations can quantitatively explain the perceptual differences observed  around the visual field. To investigate the extent to which the earliest stages of vision -optical quality and cone density- contribute to performance differences with polar angle, we created a computational observer model. The model uses the open-source software package ISETBIO to simulate an orientation discrimination task for which visual performance differs with polar angle. The model starts from the photons emitted by a display, which pass through simulated human optics with fixational eye movements, followed by cone isomerizations in the retina. Finally, we classify stimulus orientation using a support vector machine to learn a linear classifier on the photon absorptions. To account for the 30% increase in contrast thresholds for upper vertical compared to horizontal meridian, as observed psychophysically on the same task, our computational observer model would require either an increase of ~7 diopters of defocus or a reduction of 500% in cone density. These values far exceed the actual variations as a function of polar angle observed in human eyes. Therefore, we conclude that these factors in the eye only account for a small fraction of differences in visual performance with polar angle. Substantial additional asymmetries must arise in later retinal and/or cortical processing.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA fundamental goal in computational neuroscience is to link known facts from biology with behavior. Here, we considered visual behavior, specifically the fact that people are better at visual tasks performed to the left or right of the center of gaze, compared to above or below at the same distance from gaze. We sought to understand what aspects of biology govern this fundamental pattern in visual behavior. To do so, we implemented a computational observer model that incorporates known facts about the front end of the human visual system, including optics, eye movements, and the photoreceptor array in the retina. We found that even though some of these properties are correlated with performance, they fall far short of quantitatively explaining it. We conclude that later stages of processing in the nervous system greatly amplify small differences in the way the eye samples the visual world, resulting in strikingly different performance around the visual field.",

We combined multimodal MRI (9.4 T) brain assessment of the prenatal rat valproate (VPA) model and correlated immunohistological analysis of the cerebellar Purkinje cell number to address this question. We hypothesized that a suitable functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm might show some altered activity related to disrupted cerebrocerebellar information processing. Two doses of maternal VPA (400 and 600 mg/kg, s.c.) were used, and while the higher VPA dose induced a global decrease in whole brain volume, the lower dose induced a focal gray matter density decrease in the cerebellum and brainstem. Increased cortical BOLD responses to whisker stimulation were detected in both VPA groups, but it was more pronounced and extended to cerebellar regions in the 400 mg/kg VPA group. Immunohistological analysis revealed a decreased number of Purkinje cells in both VPA groups. In a detailed analysis, we revealed that the Purkinje cell number interacts with the cerebral BOLD response distinctively in the two VPA groups that highlights atypical function of the cerebrocerebellar circuit loops with potential translational value as an ASD biomarker.",

    "abstract": "Guiding the dose selection for monoclonal antibody oncology drugs is often done using methods for predicting the receptor occupancy of the drug in the tumor. In this manuscript, previous work on characterizing target inhibition at steady state using the AFIR metric [1] is extended to include a \\\"target-tissue\\\" compartment and the shedding of membrane-bound targets. A new potency metric AFTIR (Averarge Free Tissue target to Initial target ratio at steady state) is derived, and it depends on only four key quantities: the equilibrium binding constant, the fold-change in target expression at steady state after binding to drug, the biodistribution of target from circulation to target tissue, and the average drug concentration in circulation. The AFTIR metric is useful for guiding dose selection, for efficiently performing sensitivity analyses, and for building intuition for more complex target mediated drug disposition models. In particular, reducing the complex, physiological model to four key parameters needed to predict target inhibition helps to highlight specific parameters that are the most important to estimate in future experiments to guide drug development.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=145 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/432500_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (30K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6895d7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4566e0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6515e8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8168ea_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFig. 1C_FLOATNO Graphical Abstract\\n\\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Resources are often sparsely clustered in nature. Thus, foraging animals may benefit from remembering the location of a newly discovered food patch while continuing to explore nearby [1, 2]. For example, after encountering a drop of yeast or sugar, hungry flies often perform a local search consisting of frequent departures and returns to the food site [3, 4]. Fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, can perform this food-centered search behavior in the absence of external stimuli or landmarks, instead relying solely on internal (idiothetic) cues to keep track of their location [5]. This path integration behavior may represent a deeply conserved navigational capacity in insects [6, 7], but the neural pathways underlying food-triggered searches remain unknown. Here, we used optogenetic activation to screen candidate cell classes and found that local searches can be initiated by diverse sensory neurons including sugar-sensors, water-sensors, olfactory-receptor neurons, as well as hunger-signaling neurons of the central nervous system. Optogenetically-induced searches resemble those triggered by actual food and are modulated by starvation state. Furthermore, search trajectories exhibit key features of path integration: searches remain tightly centered around the fictive-food site, even during long periods without reinforcement, and flies re-center their searches when they encounter a new fictive-food site. Flies can even perform elaborate local searches within a constrained maze. Together, these results suggest that flies enact local searches in response to a wide variety of food-associated cues, and that these sensory pathways may converge upon a common neural system for path integration. Optogenetically induced local searches in Drosophila can now serve as a tractable system for the study of spatial memory and navigation in insects.",

Altogether we generated 10 datasets using a combination of droplet and plate-based scRNA-seq protocols, with varying data quality, population heterogeneity and noise levels. Using these benchmark datasets, we compared different protocols, evaluated the spike-in standard and multiple data analysis methods for tasks ranging from normalization and imputation, to clustering, trajectory analysis and data integration. Evaluation of methods across multiple datasets revealed some that performed well in general and others that suited specific situations.

    "abstract": "Estimation of allele dosage in autopolyploids is challenging and current methods often result in the misclassification of genotypes. Here we propose and compare the use of next generation sequencing read depth as continuous parameterization for autotetraploid genomic prediction of breeding values, using blueberry (Vaccinium corybosum spp.) as a model. Additionally, we investigated the influence of different sources of information to build relationship matrices in phenotype prediction; no relationship, pedigree, and genomic information, considering either diploid or tetraploid parameterizations. A real breeding population composed of 1,847 individuals was phenotyped for eight yield and fruit quality traits over two years. Analyses were based on extensive pedigree (since 1908) and high-density marker data (86K markers). Our results show that marker-based matrices can yield significantly better prediction than pedigree for most of the traits, based on model fitting and expected genetic gain. Continuous genotypic based models performed as well as the current best models and presented a significantly better goodness-of-fit for all traits analyzed. This approach also reduces the computational time required for marker calling and avoids problems associated with misclassification of genotypic classes when assigning dosage in polyploid species. Accuracies are encouraging for application of genomic selection (GS) for blueberry breeding. Conservatively, GS could reduce the time for cultivar release by three years. GS could increase the genetic gain per cycle by 86% on average when compared to phenotypic selection, and 32% when compared with pedigree-based selection.",

    "abstract": "RNA secondary structures have been increasingly recognized to play an important regulatory role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. We recently showed that RNA G-quadruplexes, which serve as cis-elements to recruit splicing factors, play a critical role in regulating alternative splicing during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In this study, we performed a high-throughput screen using a dual-color splicing reporter to identify chemical compounds capable of regulating G-quadruplex-dependent alternative splicing. We identify emetine and its analog cephaeline as small molecules that disrupt RNA G-quadruplexes, resulting in inhibition of G-quadruplex-dependent alternative splicing. Transcriptome analysis reveals that emetine globally regulates alternative splicing, including splicing of variable exons that contain splice site-proximal G-quadruplexes. These data suggest the use of emetine and cephaeline for investigating mechanisms of G-quadruplex-associated alternative splicing.",

    "abstract": "The lowland forest of Borneo is threatened by rapid logging for timber export and clearing for the expansion of timber and oil palm plantations. This combination of processes leaves behind landscapes dotted with small, often heavily-degraded forest fragments. The biodiversity value of such fragments, which are easily dismissed as worthless, is uncertain. We collected 187 taxa of rove beetles across a land-use gradient in Sabah, Malaysia, spanning pristine tropical lowland forest to heavily-degraded forest. Using these data, we identified shifts in alpha-, beta-, and gamma-diversity in response to forest quality and distance, then applied our findings from continuous expanses of forest to make predictions on hypothetical forest areas. We found that maintaining high forest quality is more important than forest area for conserving rare taxa (those important for conserving biodiversity per se), and that very small areas (10 ha) are likely to harbour the same richness of rove beetles as larger areas (100 ha) of equal forest quality. We estimate a decline in richness of 36% following heavy logging (removal of 95% of the vegetation biomass) from a forest area of 100 ha or less. Maintaining large forest area as well as high forest quality is important for conserving community composition, likely to be more important for conserving ecosystem functioning. We predict a decline of 35% in community diversity in conversion of a 100 ha area of unlogged forest to a 10 ha area of heavily-logged forest. Despite significant declines in alpha-diversity, beta-diversity within small rainforest areas may partially mitigate the loss of gamma-diversity, reinforcing the concept that beta-diversity is a dominant force determining the conservation of species in fragmented landscapes. In contrast to previous findings on larger animals, our results suggest that even small fragments of degraded forest might be important reservoirs of invertebrate biodiversity in tropical agriculture landscapes. These fragments, especially of lightly-logged forest, should be conserved where they occur and form an integral part of management for more sustainable agriculture in tropical landscapes.",

    "abstract": "The fate of alleles in the human population is believed to be highly affected by the stochastic force of genetic drift. Estimation of the strength of natural selection in humans generally necessitates a careful modeling of drift including complex effects of the population history and structure. Protein truncating variants (PTVs) are expected to evolve under strong purifying selection and to have a relatively high per-gene mutation rate. Thus, it is appealing to model the population genetics of PTVs under a simple deterministic mutation-selection balance, as has been proposed earlier [1]. Here, we investigated the limits of this approximation using both computer simulations and data-driven approaches. Our simulations rely on a model of demographic history estimated from 33,370 individual exomes of the Non-Finnish European subset of the ExAC dataset [2]. Additionally, we compared the African and European subset of the ExAC study and analyzed de novo PTVs. We show that the mutation-selection balance model is applicable to the majority of human genes, but not to genes under the weakest selection.",

    "abstract": "Nearly sixty thousand genomic regions harboring various types of candidate human-specific regulatory sequences (HSRS) have been identified using high-resolution sequencing technologies and methodologically diverse comparative analyses of human and non-human primates reference genomes. Here, the systematic analysis of evolutionary origins of 59,732 genomic loci harboring candidate HSRS has been performed to identify genomic sequences that were either inherited from extinct common ancestors (ECAs) or created de novo in human genomes after the split of human and chimpanzee lineages. Present analyses revealed thousands of HSRS that appear inherited from ECAs yet bypassed genomes of our closest evolutionary relatives, Chimpanzee and Bonobo, presumably due to the incomplete lineage sorting and/or species-specific loss or regulatory DNA. The bypassing pattern is particularly prominent for HSRS putatively associated with development and functions of human brain. Significant fractions of retrotransposon-derived loci that are transcriptionally-active in human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are highly conserved in genomes of Gorilla, Orangutan, Gibbon, and Rhesus (1,688; 1,371; 1,148; and 1,045 loci, respectively), yet they are absent in genomes of both Chimpanzee and Bonobo. These observations were independently corroborated by common evolutionary patterns of 248 insertions sites of African ape-specific retrovirus PtERV1 (45.9%; p = 1.03E-44) intersecting genomic regions harboring 442 HSRS, which are enriched for HSRS that have been associated with human-specific (HS) changes of gene expression in cerebral organoid models of brain development. A prominent majority of genomic regions harboring HS mutations associated with HS gene expression changes during brain development is highly conserved in Chimpanzee, Bonobo, and Gorilla genomes. Among nonhuman primates (NHP), most significant fractions of candidate HSRS associated with HS gene expression changes in both excitatory neurons (347 loci; 67%) and radial glia (683 loci; 72%) are highly conserved in the Gorilla genome. Present analyses revealed that Modern Humans captured unique combinations of regulatory sequences, divergent subsets of which are highly conserved in distinct species of six NHP separated by 30 million years of evolution. Concurrently, this unique-to-human mosaic of genomic regulatory patterns inherited from ECAs was supplemented with 12,486 created de novo HSRS. Evidence of multispecies evolutionary origins of HSRS support the model of complex continuous speciation process during evolution of Great Apes that is not likely to occur as an instantaneous event.",

    "abstract": "To date, investigations of executive function (EF) have focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and prominent theories of EF are framed with respect to this brain region. Multiple theories describe a hierarchical functional organization for the lateral PFC. However, recent evidence has indicated that the cerebellum (CB) also plays a role in EF. Posterior CB regions (Crus I & II) show structural and functional connections with the PFC, and CB networks are associated with individual differences in EF in healthy adults. However, it is unclear whether the cerebellum shows a similar functional gradient as does the PFC. Here, we investigated high-resolution resting-state data from 225 participants in the Human Connectome Project. We compared resting-state connectivity from posterior cerebellar ROIs, and examined functional data from several tasks that activate the lateral PFC. Demonstrating preliminary evidence for parallel PFC and CB gradients, Crus I was functionally connected with rostrolateral PFC, Crus II with middle and ventral PFC, and Lobule VI with posterior PFC. Contrary to previous work, the activation of the task thought to activate rostrolateral PFC resembled the connectivity maps of Crus II, not Crus I; similarly, the activation of the task thought to activate middle PFC resembled the connectivity maps of Crus I, not Crus II. Nevertheless, there was evidence for dissociable CB-PFC networks. Further work is necessary to understand the functional role of these networks.",

Yet, it is unknown how this information is used for even simple perceptual choices such as discriminating orientation. To determine the computation underlying this perceptual choice, we took advantage of the robust adaptation in the mouse visual system. We find that adaptation increases animals thresholds for orientation discrimination. This was unexpected since optimal computations that take advantage of all available sensory information predict that the shift in tuning and increase in signal-to-noise ratio in the adapted condition should improve discrimination. Instead, we find that the effects of adaptation on behavior can be explained by the appropriate reliance of the perceptual choice circuits on target preferring neurons, but the failure to discount neurons that prefer the distractor. This suggests that to solve this task the circuit has adopted a suboptimal strategy that discards important task-related information to implement a feed-forward visual computation.",

Recently, genome-wide methods identified an intermediate level of chromosome organization, topologically associating domains (TADs), that play key roles in transcriptional regulation. However, these methods cannot directly examine the interplay between transcriptional activation and chromosome organization while maintaining spatiotemporal information. Here, we present a multiplexed, sequential imaging approach (Hi-M) that permits the simultaneous detection of chromosome organization and transcription in single nuclei. We used Hi-M to study chromosome organization during the awakening of the zygotic genome in intact Drosophila embryos. By visualizing chromosome architecture and gene expression simultaneously in single nuclei, we were able to unveil the changes in 3D chromatin organization occurring upon transcriptional activation and homologous chromosome un-pairing. Excitingly, the ability of Hi-M to explore the multi-scale chromosome architecture in time and space will be key to understand the mechanisms and consequences of the 4D organization of the genome.",

    "abstract": "Sound correspondence patterns play a crucial role for linguistic reconstruction. Linguists use them to prove language relationship, to reconstruct proto-forms, and for classical phylogenetic reconstruction based on shared innovations. Cognate words which fail to conform with expected patterns can further point to various kinds of exceptions in sound change, such as analogy or assimilation of frequent words. Here we present an automatic method for the inference of sound correspondence patterns across multiple languages based on a network approach. The core idea is to represent all columns in aligned cognate sets as nodes in a network with edges representing the degree of compatibility between the nodes. The task of inferring all compatible correspondence sets can then be handled as the well-known minimum clique cover problem in graph theory, which essentially seeks to split the graph into the smallest number of cliques in which each node is represented by exactly one clique. The resulting partitions represent all correspondence patterns which can be inferred for a given dataset. By excluding those patterns which occur in only a few cognate sets, the core of regularly recurring sound correspondences can be inferred. Based on this idea, the paper presents a method for automatic correspondence pattern recognition, which is implemented as part of a Python library which supplements the paper. To illustrate the usefulness of the method, we present how the inferred patterns can be used to predict words that have not been observed before.",

    "abstract": "The metabolic pathways of central carbon metabolism, glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), are important host factors that determine the outcome of viral infections and can therefore be manipulated by some viruses to favor infection. However, mechanisms of metabolic modulation and their effects on viral replication vary widely. Herein, we present the first metabolomics profile of norovirus-infected cells, which revealed increases in glycolysis, OXPHOS, and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) during murine norovirus infection. Inhibiting glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) in transformed and primary macrophages revealed that host cell metabolism is an important factor for optimal murine norovirus (MNV) infection. 2DG affected an early stage in the viral life cycle after viral uptake and capsid uncoating, leading to decreased levels of viral protein translation and viral RNA replication. The requirement of central carbon metabolism was specific for MNV (but not astrovirus) infection, independent of the Type I interferon antiviral response, and unlikely to be due to a lack of host cell nucleotide synthesis. MNV infection increased activation of the protein kinase Akt, but not AMPK, two master regulators of cellular metabolism, suggesting Akt signaling may play a role in upregulating central carbon metabolism during norovirus infection. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the metabolic state of target cells is an intrinsic host factor that determines the extent of norovirus replication and implicates metabolism as a virulence determinant. They further implicate cellular metabolism as a novel therapeutic target for norovirus infections and improvements of current human norovirus culture systems.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEViruses depend on the host cells they infect to provide the machinery and substrates for replication. Host cells are highly dynamic systems that can alter their intracellular environment and metabolic behavior, which may be helpful or inhibitory for an infecting virus. In this study, we show that macrophages, a target cell of murine norovirus (MNV), increase central carbon metabolism upon viral infection, which is important for early steps in MNV infection. Human noroviruses (hNoV) are a major cause of gastroenteritis globally, causing enormous morbidity and economic burden. Currently, no effective antivirals or vaccines exist for hNoV, mainly due to the lack of high efficiency in vitro culture models for their study. Thus, insights gained from the MNV model may reveal aspects of host cell metabolism that can be targeted for improving hNoV cell culture systems and for developing effective antiviral therapies.",

However, it is not well understood how reward influences task selection when multiple options are possible. To address this issue, we examined brain activation in a voluntary task-switching paradigm while participants underwent fMRI (n=19). To reinforce the overall goal to choose the tasks randomly, participants were told of a large bonus they would receive at the end of the experiment for making random task choices. We also examined how occasional, random rewards influenced both task performance and brain activation. We hypothesized that these transient rewards would increase the value of the just-performed task and therefore bias participants to choose to repeat the same task on the subsequent trial. Contrary to expectations, transient reward had no consistent behavioral effect on subsequent task choice. Nevertheless, the receipt of such rewards did influence activation in brain regions associated with reward processing as well as those associated with goal-directed control. In addition, reward on a prior trial was found to influence activation during task choice on a subsequent trial, with greater activation in a number of executive function regions as compared to no-reward trials. We posit that both the random presentation of transient rewards and the overall task bonus for random task choices together reinforced the goal to choose the tasks randomly, which in turn influenced activation in both reward-related regions and those regions involved in abstract goal processing.",

    "abstract": "The transcriptional mechanisms that allow neural stem cells (NSC) to balance self-renewal with differentiation are not well understood. Employing an in vivo RNAi screen we identify here NSC-TAFs, a subset of nine TATA-binding protein associated factors (TAFs), as NSC identity genes in Drosophila. We found that depletion of NSC-TAFs results in decreased NSC clone size, reduced proliferation, defective cell polarity and increased hypersensitivity to cell cycle perturbation, without affecting NSC survival. Integrated gene expression and genomic binding analyses revealed that NSC-TAFs function with both TBP and TRF2, and that NSC-TAF-TBP and NSC-TAF-TRF2 shared target genes encode different subsets of transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins with established or emerging roles in NSC identity and brain development. Taken together, our results demonstrate that core promoter factors are selectively required for NSC identity in vivo by promoting cell cycle progression and NSC cell polarity as well as by restraining premature differentiation. Because pathogenic variants in a subset of TAFs have all been linked to human neurological disorders, this work may stimulate and inform future animal models of TAF-linked neurological disorders.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe brains of many animal species are built with brain stem cells. Having too many brain stem cells can lead to brain tumors whereas too few can lead to birth defects such as microcephaly. A number of next generation sequencing studies have implicated proteins referred to as TATA-box-binding protein associated factors (TAFs) in human neurological disorders including microcephaly, but prior to this study, their function in brain development was unknown. Here we use brain stem cells, known as neural stem cells (NSCs), from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to decipher how TAFs control brain stem cell identity. By combining genetics and low-input genomics, we show that TAFs directly control NSC cell division and cell polarity but do not appear to be required for NSC survival. We further show that TAFs accomplish these functions by associating either with their canonical partner TBP (TATA-binding protein) or the related protein TRF2. In summary, our study reveals unexpected and gene-selective functions of a unique subset of TAFs and their binding partners, which could inform future studies that seek to model human neurological disorders associated with TAFs.",

    "abstract": "The cranial trigeminal ganglia play a vital role in the peripheral nervous system through their relay of sensory information from the vertebrate head to the brain. These ganglia are generated from the intermixing and coalescence of two distinct cell populations: cranial neural crest cells and placodal neurons. Trigeminal ganglia assembly requires the formation of cadherin-based adherens junctions within the neural crest cell and placodal neuron populations; however, the molecular composition of these adherens junctions is still unknown. Herein, we aimed to define the spatio-temporal expression pattern and function of Cadherin-7 during early chick trigeminal ganglia formation. Our data reveal that Cadherin-7 is expressed exclusively in migratory cranial neural crest cells and is absent from trigeminal neurons. Using molecular perturbation experiments, we demonstrate that modulation of Cadherin-7 in neural crest cells influences trigeminal ganglia assembly, including the organization of neural crest cells and placodal neurons within the ganglionic anlage. Moreover, alterations in Cadherin-7 levels lead to changes in the morphology of trigeminal neurons. Taken together, these findings provide additional insight into the role of cadherin-based adhesion in trigeminal ganglia formation, and, more broadly, the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate the cellular interactions essential for cranial gangliogenesis.",

    "abstract": "T-cell receptors (TCRs) detect specifically and sensitively a small number of agonist peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) from an ocean of structurally similar self-pMHCs to trigger antigen-specific adaptive immune responses1-4. Despite intense efforts, the mechanism underlying TCR ligand discrimination remains a major unanswered question in immunology. Here we show that a TCR discriminates between closely related peptides by forming TCR-pMHC bonds with different lengths, which precisely control the accessibility of CD3{zeta} immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) for phosphorylation. Using in situ fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)3,5, we measured the intermolecular length of single TCR-pMHC bonds and the intramolecular distance of individual TCR-CD3{zeta} complexes at the membrane of live primary T cells. We found that an agonist forms a short TCR-pMHC bond to pull the otherwise sequestered CD3{zeta} off the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, leading to full exposure of its ITAMs for strong phosphorylation. By contrast, a structurally similar weaker peptide forms a longer bond with the TCR, resulting in partial dissociation of CD3{zeta} from the membrane and weak phosphorylation. Furthermore, we found that TCR-pMHC bond length determines 2D TCR binding kinetics and affinity, T-cell calcium signaling and T-cell proliferation, governing the entire process of signal reception, transduction and regulation. Thus, our data reveal the fundamental mechanism by which a TCR deciphers the structural differences between foreign antigens and self-peptides via TCR-pMHC bond length to initiate different TCR signaling for ligand discrimination.",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that undergoes latency in cells of the hematopoietic compartment, though the mechanisms underlying establishment and maintenance of latency remain elusive. We previously reported that the HCMV-encoded G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) homolog, US28 is required for successful latent infection. We now show that US28 protein (pUS28) provided in trans complements the US28{Delta} lytic phenotype in myeloid cells, suggesting that sustained US28 expression is necessary for long-term latency. Furthermore, expression of pUS28 at the time of infection represses transcription from the major immediate early promoter (MIEP) within 24 hours. However, this repression is only maintained in the presence of continual pUS28 expression provided in trans. Our data also reveal that pUS28-mediated signaling attenuates both expression and phosphorylation of cellular fos (c-fos), an AP-1 transcription factor subunit, to repress MIEP-driven transcription. AP-1 binds to the MIEP and promotes lytic replication, and in line with this, we find that US28{Delta} infection results in an increase in AP-1 binding to the MIEP, compared to wild type latent infection. Pharmacological inhibition of c-fos represses the MIEP during US28{Delta} infection to similar levels we observe during wild type latent infection. Together, our data reveal that US28 is required for both establishment and long-term maintenance of HCMV latency, which is modulated, at least in part, by repressing functional AP-1 binding to the MIEP.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a wise-spread pathogen that remains with an individual for life in a quiescent/latent state, posing little threat to an otherwise healthy person. However, when an individuals immune system is severely compromised, HCMV can reactivate to its active/lytic state, resulting in viral spread and disease that is often fatal. The biological mechanisms underlying HCMV latency and reactivation remain poorly understood. Herein we show that the viral-encoded G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) US28 aids in the establishment and the maintenance of viral latency. Furthermore, we find that US28 modulates host cell proteins to suppress viral processes associated with active/lytic replication, thereby promoting latent infection. This work provides mechanism by which HCMV modulates the host cell environment to its advantage.",

    "abstract": "Hot desert surface soils are characterised by extremely low water activities for large parts of any annual cycle. It is widely assumed that microbial processes in such soils are very limited. Here we present the first metatranscriptomic survey of microbial community function in a low water activity hyperarid desert soil. Sequencing of total mRNA revealed a diverse and active community, dominated by Actinobacteria. Metatranscriptomic analysis of samples taken at different times over three days indicated that most functions did not fluctuate on a diel basis, except for a eukaryotic subpopulation which was induced during the cooler night hours. High levels of transcription of chemoautotrophic carbon fixation genes contrasted with limited expression of photosynthetic genes, indicating that chemoautotrophy is an important alternative to photosynthesis for carbon cycling in desiccated desert soils. Analysis of the transcriptional levels of key N-cycling genes provided strong evidence that soil nitrate was the dominant nitrogen input source. Transcriptional network analyses and taxon-resolved functional profiling suggested that nutrient acquisition processes, and not diurnal environmental variation, were the main drivers of community activity in hyperarid Namib Desert soil. While we also observed significant levels of expression of common stress response genes, these genes were not dominant hubs in the co-occurrence network.",

    "abstract": "Necrotizing fasciitis and myositis are devastating infections characterized by high mortality. Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a common cause of these infections, but the molecular pathogenesis is poorly understood. We report a genome-wide analysis using serotype M1 and M28 strains that identified novel GAS genes contributing to necrotizing myositis in nonhuman primates (NHP), a clinically relevant model. Using transposon directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS) we identified 126 and 116 GAS genes required for infection by serotype M1 and M28 organisms, respectively. For both M1 and M28 strains, more than 25% of the GAS genes required for necrotizing myositis encode known or putative transporters. Thirteen GAS transporters contributed to both M1 and M28 strain fitness in NHP myositis, including putative importers for amino acids, carbohydrates, and vitamins, and exporters for toxins, quorum sensing peptides, and uncharacterized molecules. Targeted deletion of genes encoding five transporters confirmed that each isogenic mutant strain was significantly impaired in causing necrotizing myositis in NHPs. qRT-PCR analysis showed that these five genes are expressed in infected NHP and human skeletal muscle. Certain substrate-binding lipoproteins of these transporters, such as Spy0271 and Spy1728, were previously documented to be surface-exposed, suggesting that our findings have translational research implications.",

    "abstract": "Expression of biofilm-associated genes is controlled by multiple regulatory elements, allowing bacteria to appropriately switch between sessile and motile lifestyles. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the post-transcriptional regulator RsmA has been implicated in the control of various genes including those related to biofilms, but much of the evidence for these links is limited to transcriptomic and phenotypic studies. RsmA binds to target mRNAs to modulate translation by affecting ribosomal access and/or mRNA stability. Here we trace a global regulatory role of RsmA to the inhibition of Vfr - a transcription factor that controls a transcriptional regulator FleQ. FleQ directly controls biofilm-associated genes that encode the PEL polysaccharide biosynthesis machinery. Furthermore, we show that RsmA cannot bind vfr mRNA alone, but requires the RNA chaperone protein Hfq. This is the first example where a RsmA protein family member is demonstrated to require another protein for RNA binding.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is accelerating global soil respiration, which could in turn accelerate climate change. The biological mechanisms through which soil carbon (C) responds to climate are not well understood, limiting our ability to predict future global soil respiration rates. As part of a climate manipulation experiment, we tested whether differences in soil heterotrophic respiration driven by season or climate treatment (RH) are linked to 1) relative abundances of microbes in active and dormant metabolic states, 2) net changes in microbial biomass and/or 3) changes in the relative abundances of microbial groups with different C-use strategies. We used a flow-cytometric single-cell metabolic assay to quantify the abundance of active and dormant microbes, and the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) method to determine microbial biomass and ratios of fungi:bacteria and Gram-positive:Gram-negative bacteria. RH did not respond to climate treatments but was greater in the warm and dry summer than in the cool and less-dry fall. These dynamics were better explained when microbial data were taken into account compared to when only physical data (temperature and moisture) were used. Overall, our results suggest that RH responses to temperature are stronger when soil contains more active microbes, and that seasonal patterns of RH can be better explained by shifts in microbial activity than by shifts in the relative abundances of fungi and Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These findings contribute to our understanding of how and under which conditions microbes influence soil C responses to climate.",
