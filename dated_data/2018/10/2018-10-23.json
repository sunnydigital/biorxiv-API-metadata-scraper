    "abstract": "BackgroundInexpensive high-throughput DNA sequencing has democratized access to genetic information for most organisms so that research utilizing a genome or transcriptome of an organism is not limited to model systems. However, the quality of the assemblies of sampled genomes can vary greatly which hampers utility for comparisons and meaningful interpretation. The uncertainty of the completeness of a given genome sequence can limit feasibility of asserting patterns of high rates of gene loss reported in many lineages.\\n\\nResultsWe propose a computational framework and sequence resource for assessing completeness of fungal genomes called FGMP (Fungal Genome Mapping Project). Our approach is based on evolutionary conserved sets of proteins and DNA elements and is applicable to various types of genomic data. We present a comparison of FGMP and state-of-the-art methods for genome completeness assessment utilizing 246 genome assemblies of fungi. We discuss genome assembly improvements/degradations in 57 cases where assemblies have been updated, as recorded by NCBI assembly archive.\\n\\nConclusionFGMP is an accurate tool for quantifying level of completion from fungal genomic data. It is particularly useful for non-model organisms without reference genomes and can be used directly on unassembled reads, which can help reducing genome sequencing costs.",

    "abstract": "To detect a direction to evolution, without the pitfalls of reconstructing ancestral states, we need to compare \\\"more evolved\\\" to \\\"less evolved\\\" entities. But because all extant species have the same common ancestor, none are chronologically more evolved than any other. However, different gene families were born at different times, allowing us to compare young protein-coding genes to those that are older and hence have been evolving for longer. To be retained during evolution, a protein must not only have a function, but must also avoid toxic dysfunction such as protein aggregation. There is conflict between the two requirements; hydrophobic amino acids form the cores of protein folds, but also promote aggregation. Young genes avoid strongly hydrophobic amino acids, which is presumably the simplest solution to the aggregation problem. Here we show that young genes few hydrophobic residues are clustered near one another along the primary sequence, presumably to assist folding. The higher aggregation risk created by the higher hydrophobicity of older genes is counteracted by more subtle effects in the ordering of the amino acids, including a reduction in the clustering of hydrophobic residues until they eventually become more interspersed than if distributed randomly. This interspersion has previously been reported to be a general property of proteins, but here we find that it is restricted to old genes. Quantitatively, the index of dispersion delineates a gradual trend, i.e. a decrease in the clustering of hydrophobic amino acids over billions of years.",

    "abstract": "The progressive maturation of cells down differentiation lineages is controlled by collaborative interactions between networks of extracellular signals and intracellular transcription factors. In the vertebrate spinal cord, FGF, Wnt and Retinoic Acid signaling pathways regulate the progressive caudal-to-rostral maturation of neural progenitors by regulating a poorly understood gene regulatory network of transcription factors. We have mapped out this gene regulatory network in the chicken pre-neural tube, identifying CDX4 as a dual-function core component that simultaneously regulates gradual loss of cell potency and acquisition of differentiation states: in a caudal-to-rostral direction, CDX4 represses the early neural differentiation marker Nkx1.2 and promotes the late neural differentiation marker Pax6. Significantly, CDX4 prevents premature PAX6-dependent neural differentiation by blocking Ngn2 activation. This regulation of CDX4 over Pax6 is restricted to the rostral pre-neural tube by Retinoic Acid signaling. Together, our results show that in the spinal cord, CDX4 is part of the gene regulatory network controlling the sequential and progressive transition of states from high to low potency during neural progenitor maturation. Given CDX well-known involvement in Hox gene regulation, we propose that CDX factors coordinate the maturation and axial specification of neural progenitor cells during spinal cord development.",

However, it remains unclear how neurons can provide a stable representation of external stimuli given their history-dependent responses. Here we show that a stable representation is maintained if efficiency is optimized by a population of neurons rather than by neurons individually. We show that spike-frequency adaptation and E/I balanced recurrent connectivity emerge as solutions to a global cost-accuracy tradeoff. The network will re-distribute sensory responses from highly excitable neurons to less excitable neurons as the cost of neural activity increases. This does not change the representation at the population level, despite causing dynamic changes in individual neurons. By applying this framework to an orientation coding network, we reconcile neural and behavioral findings. Our approach underscores the common mechanisms behind the diversity of neural adaptation and its role in producing a reliable representation of the stimulus while minimizing metabolic cost.",

    "abstract": "Recent proposals in quantum gravity have suggested that unknown systems can mediate entanglement between two known quantum systems, if and only if the mediator itself is non-classical. This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\n\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.",

    "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly clear that many proteins start to fold cotranslationally, before the entire polypeptide chain has been synthesized on the ribosome. One class of proteins that a priori would seem particularly prone to cotranslational folding is repeat proteins, i.e., proteins that are built from an array of nearly identical sequence repeats. However, while the folding of repeat proteins has been studied extensively in vitro with purified proteins, only a handful of studies have addressed the issue of cotranslational folding of repeat proteins. Here, we have determined the structure and studied the cotranslational folding of a {beta}-helix pentarepeat protein from the human pathogen Clostridium botulinum - a homolog of the Fluoroquinolone Resistance Protein MfpA - using an assay in which the SecM translational arrest peptide serves as a force sensor to detect folding events. We find that cotranslational folding of a segment corresponding to the first four of the eight {beta}-helix coils in the protein produces enough force to release ribosome stalling, and that folding starts when this unit is ~35 residues away from the P-site, near the distal end of the ribosome exit tunnel. An additional folding transition is seen when the whole PENT moiety emerges from the exit tunnel. The early cotranslational formation of a folded unit may be important to avoid misfolding events in vivo, and may reflect the minimal size of a stable {beta}-helix since it is structurally homologous to the smallest known {beta}-helix protein, a four-coil protein that is stable in solution.",

    "abstract": "Seminal human brain histology work has demonstrated developmental waves of myelination. Here, using a micro-structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) marker linked to myelin, we studied fine-grained age differences to deduce waves of growth, stability, and decline of cortical myelination over the life-cycle. In 484 participants, aged 8-85 years, we fitted smooth growth curves to T1- to T2-weighted ratio in each of 360 regions from one of 7 cytoarchitectonic classes. From the first derivatives of these generally inverted-U trajectories, we defined three milestones: the age at peak growth; the age at onset of a stable plateau; and the age at the onset of decline. Age at peak growth had a bimodal distribution comprising an early (pre-pubertal) wave of primary sensory and motor cortices and a later (post-pubertal) wave of association, insular and limbic cortices. Most regions reached stability in the 30s but there was a second wave reaching stability in the 50s. Age at onset of decline was also bimodal: in some right hemisphere regions, the curve declined from the 60s, but in other left hemisphere regions, there was no significant decline from the stable plateau. These results are consistent with regionally heterogeneous waves of intracortical myelinogenesis and age-related demyelination.",

    "abstract": "Like many species, movement patterns of southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) are being influenced by long-term environmental change. These seals migrate up to 4000 km from their breeding colonies, foraging for months in a variety of Southern Ocean habitats. Understanding how movement patterns vary with environmental features and how these relationships differ among individuals employing different foraging strategies can provide insight into foraging performance at a population level. We apply new fast-estimation tools to fit mixed effects within a random walk movement model, rapidly inferring among-individual variability in southern elephant seal environment-movement relationships. We found that seals making foraging trips to the sea-ice on or near the Antarctic continental shelf consistently reduced speed and directionality (move persistence) with increasing sea ice coverage and had variable responses to chlorophyll a concentration, whereas seals that foraged pelagically reduced move persistence in regions where circumpolar deep water shoaled. Given future climate scenarios, pelagic foragers may encounter more productive habitat but sea-ice foragers may see reduced habitat availability. Our approach is scalable to large telemetry data sets and allows flexible combinations of mixed effects to be evaluated via model selection, thereby illuminating the ecological context of animal movements that underlie habitat use.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional nucleoside modifications have long been recognized as key modulators of non-coding RNA structure and function. There is an emerging appreciation that the chemical modification of protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) also plays critical roles in the cell. Although there are over 100 known RNA modifications found in biology only a handful have been identified in mRNAs. We sought to identify and quantify modifications present in the mRNAs of yeast cells using a high throughput ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method that measures the levels of 36 types of RNA nucleosides in parallel. We detected the presence of six modified nucleosides in mRNAs at relatively high abundances: N7-methylguanosine, N6-methyladenosine, 2-O-methylguanosine, 2-O-methylcytosine, N4-acetylcytidine and 5-formylcytidine. Additionally, we investigated how the levels of mRNA modifications vary in response to cellular stress. We find that the concentrations of mRNA modifications including N6-methyladenosine and N4-acetylcytidine change in response to heat stress, glucose starvation and/or oxidative stress. This work expands the repertoire of potential chemical modifications in mRNAs, and utilizes a high-throughput approach to search for modifications that highlights the value of integrating mass-spectrometry tools in the mRNA modification discovery and characterization pipeline.",

While many studies measure antimicrobial use on dairy farms, none report the quantity of antimicrobials stored on farms, nor the ways in which they are stored. The majority of PVM treatments occur in the absence of the prescribing veterinarian, yet there is an identifiable knowledge gap surrounding PVM use and farmer decision making. To provide an evidence base for future work on PVM use, data were collected from 27 dairy farms in England and Wales in Autumn 2016. The number of different PVM stored on farms ranged from 9-35, with antimicrobials being the most common therapeutic group stored. Injectable antimicrobials comprised the greatest weight of active ingredient found while intramammary antimicrobials were the most frequent unit of medicine stored. Antimicrobials classed by the European Medicines Agency as critically-important to human health were present on most farms, and the presence of expired medicines and medicines not licensed for use in dairy cattle was also common. The medicine resources available to farmers are likely to influence their treatment decisions, therefore evidence of the PVM stored on farms can help inform understanding of medicine use.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe average power of rhythmic neural responses as captured by MEG/EEG/LFP recordings is a prevalent index of human brain function. Increasing evidence questions the utility of trial-/group averaged power estimates however, as seemingly sustained activity patterns may be brought about by time-varying transient signals in each single trial. Hence, it is crucial to accurately describe the duration and power of rhythmic and arrhythmic neural responses on the single trial-level. However, it is less clear how well this can be achieved in empirical MEG/EEG/LFP recordings. Here, we extend an existing rhythm detection algorithm (extended Better OSCillation detection: \"eBOSC\"; cf. Whitten et al., 2011) to systematically investigate boundary conditions for estimating neural rhythms at the single-trial level. Using simulations as well as resting and task-based EEG recordings from a micro-longitudinal assessment, we show that alpha rhythms can be successfully captured in single trials with high specificity, but that the quality of single-trial estimates varies greatly between subjects. Despite those signal-to-noise-based limitations, we highlight the utility and potential of rhythm detection with multiple proof-of-concept examples, and discuss implications for single-trial analyses of neural rhythms in electrophysiological recordings. Using an applied example of working memory retention, rhythm detection indicated load-related increases in the duration of frontal theta and posterior alpha rhythms, in addition to a frequency decrease of frontal theta rhythms that was observed exclusively through amplification of rhythmic amplitudes.\n\nHighlightsO_LITraditional narrow-band rhythm metrics conflate the power and duration of rhythmic and arrhythmic periods. We extend a state-of-the-art rhythm detection method (eBOSC) to derive rhythmic episodes in single trials that can disambiguate rhythmic and arrhythmic periods.\nC_LIO_LISimulations indicate that this can be done with high specificity given sufficient rhythmic power, but with strongly impaired sensitivity when rhythmic SNR is low. Empirically, surface EEG recordings exhibit stable inter-individual differences in -rhythmicity in ranges where simulations suggest a gradual bias, leading to high collinearity between narrow-band and rhythm-specific estimates.\nC_LIO_LIBeyond these limitations, we highlight multiple empirical benefits of characterizing rhythmic episodes in single trials, such as (a) a principled separation of rhythmic and arrhythmic content, (b) an amplification of rhythmic amplitudes, and (c) a specific characterization of sustained and transient events.\nC_LIO_LIIn an exemplary application, rhythm-specific estimates increase sensitivity to working memory load effects, in addition to indicating a frequency modulation of frontal theta rhythms through the amplification of rhythmic power.\nC_LI",

Thetas role during adolescence, a developmental window characterized by a motivation-control mismatch also remains unclear, preventing possible cross-species work. Here, adolescents performed a flanker task alone or under observation to increase social motivation. We separated theta dynamics immediately before/after motor responses, identifying functional dissociations. We also dissociate MFC connectivity with rostral/caudal frontal cortex and distinct forms of behavioral control, which further differed before/after response. Finally, social motivation was found to exclusively upregulate post-response error monitoring and changes in control to prevent future errors, as opposed to pre-response theta dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Colour is a defining feature of many objects, playing a crucial role in our ability to rapidly recognise things in the world around us and make categorical distinctions. For example, colour is a useful cue when distinguishing lemons from limes or blackberries from raspberries. That means our representation of many objects includes key colour-related information. The question addressed here is whether the neural representation activated by knowing that something is red is the same as that activated when we actually see something red, particularly in regard to timing. We addressed this question using neural timeseries (magnetoencephalography, MEG) data to contrast real colour perception and implied object colour activation. We applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to analyse the brain activation patterns evoked by colour accessed via real colour perception and implied colour activation. Applying MVPA to MEG data allows us here to focus on the temporal dynamics of these processes. Male and female human participants (N=18) viewed isoluminant red and green shapes and grey-scale, luminance-matched pictures of fruits and vegetables that are red (e.g., tomato) or green (e.g., kiwifruit) in nature. We show that the brain activation pattern evoked by real colour perception is similar to implied colour activation, but that this pattern is instantiated at a later time. These results suggest that a common colour representation can be triggered by activating object representations from memory and perceiving colours.",

    "abstract": "Current pathway synthesis tools identify possible pathways that can be added to a host to produce a desired target molecule through the exploration of abstract metabolic and reaction network space. However, not many of these tools do explore gene-level information required to physically realize the identified synthesis pathways, and none explore enzyme-host compatibility. Developing tools that address this disconnect between abstract reactions/metabolic design space and physical genetic sequence design space will enable expedited experimental efforts that avoid exploring unprofitable synthesis pathways. This work describes a workflow, termed Probabilistic Pathway Assembly with Solubility Scores (ProPASS), which links synthesis pathway construction with the exploration of the physical design space as imposed by the availability of enzymes with characterized activities within the host. Predicted protein solubility propensity scores are used as a confidence level to quantify the compatibility of each pathway enzyme with the host (E. coli). This work also presents a database, termed Protein Solubility Database (ProSol DB), which provides solubility confidence scores in E. coli for 240,016 characterized enzymes obtained from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. The utility of ProPASS is demonstrated by generating genetic implementations of heterologous synthesis pathways in E. coli that target several commercially useful biomolecules.\\n\\nAvailabilityProSol DB data and code for ProPASS are available for download from https://github.com/HassounLab/",

This study was undertaken to characterize Streptomyces strains, occurring in soils of different districts of Tamilnadu, India as well as to evaluate their potential to produce antimicrobial compounds. Samples were collected from rice rhizosphere from different district of Tamilnadu agricultural zone. In primary screening by cross streak method, Streptomyces strains were assessed for antibiotic production and activity against different human bacterial. Then active isolates were selected for secondary screening by agar well diffusion method. Solvent extraction method was used to identify the best crude samples which are exhibiting better antibacterial activity. Then, 16S rRNA PCR was carried out for confirmation of isolates. In primary screening among all of the isolates, 50% isolates were active against at least one of the test organisms and 21.31% strains exhibited a broad-spectrum activity against almost all of the test bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the ethyl acetate extracts measured. Out of 26 positive strains two of the most active isolates SVG-07-15 and TK-01-05 were taken for further studies. These results highlight the importance of Streptomyces isolates in antibiotic production. Together with antibacterial activity, the PKS gene based approach can be applied for efficient screening of isolated strains of pharmaceutical value and related compounds.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIsolation of actinomycetes from soil samples collected from South India.\nC_LIO_LIScreening of isolated actinomycetes for antibacterial activity\nC_LIO_LIDetails study of potent strains against human pathogens\nC_LIO_LIIdentification of PKS gene from the active strains\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVery low-carbohydrate diets have been reported to substantially increase human energy expenditure as measured by doubly labeled water (DLW) but not by respiratory chambers. Do the DLW data reflect true physiological differences that are undetected by respiratory chambers? Alternatively, are the apparent DLW energy expenditure a consequence of failure to fully account for respiratory quotient (RQ) differences between diets?\\n\\nObjectiveTo examine energy expenditure differences between diets varying drastically in carbohydrate and to quantitatively compare DLW data with respiratory chamber and body composition measurements within an energy balance framework.\\n\\nDesignDLW measurements were obtained during the final two weeks of month-long baseline (BD; 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, 15% protein) and isocaloric ketogenic diets (KD; 5% carbohydrate, 80% fat, 15% protein) in 17 men with BMI 25-35 kg/m2. Subjects resided 2d/week in respiratory chambers to measure energy expenditure (EEchamber). DLW expenditure was calculated using chamber-determined respiratory quotients (RQ) either unadjusted (EEDLW) or adjusted (EEDLW{Delta}RQ) for net energy imbalance using diet-specific coefficients. Accelerometers measured physical activity. Body composition changes were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry which were combined with energy intake measurements to calculate energy expenditure by balance (EEbal).\\n\\nResultsAfter transitioning from BD to KD, neither EEchamber nor EEbal were significantly changed ({triangleup}EEchamber=24{+/-}30 kcal/d; p=0.43 and {triangleup}EEbal=-141{+/-}118 kcal/d; p=0.25). Similarly, physical activity (-5.1{+/-}4.8%; p=0.3) and exercise efficiency (-1.6{+/-}2.4%; p=0.52) were not significantly changed. However, EEDLW was 209{+/-}83 kcal/d higher during the KD (p=0.023) but was not significantly increased when adjusted for energy balance (EEDLW{Delta}RQ =139{+/-}89 kcal/d; p=0.14). After removing 2 outliers whose EEDLW were incompatible with other data, EEDLW and EEDLW{triangleup}RQ were marginally increased during the KD by 126{+/-}62 kcal/d (p=0.063) and 46{+/-}65 kcal/d (p=0.49), respectively.\\n\\nConclusionsDLW calculations failing to account for diet-specific energy imbalance effects on RQ erroneously suggest that very low carbohydrate diets substantially increase energy expenditure.",

    "abstract": "Classical theory maintains that ageing evolves via energy trade-offs between reproduction and survival leading to accumulation of unrepaired cellular damage with age. In contrast, the emerging new theory postulates that ageing evolves because of deleterious late-life hyper-function of reproduction-promoting genes leading to excessive biosynthesis in late-life. The hyper-function theory uniquely predicts that optimizing nutrient-sensing molecular signalling in adulthood can simultaneously postpone ageing and increase Darwinian fitness. Here we show that reducing evolutionarily conserved insulin/IGF-1 nutrient-sensing signalling via daf-2 RNA interference (RNAi) fulfils this prediction in Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. Long-lived daf-2 RNAi parents showed normal fecundity as self-fertilizing hermaphrodites and improved late-life reproduction when mated to males. Remarkably, the offspring of daf-2 RNAi parents had higher Darwinian fitness across three different genotypes. Thus, reduced nutrient-sensing signalling in adulthood improves both parental longevity and offspring fitness supporting the emerging view that sub-optimal gene expression in late-life lies at the heart of ageing.\n\nImpact StatementUnderstanding mechanisms underpinning ageing is fundamental to improving quality of life in an increasingly long-lived society. Recent breakthroughs have challenged the long-standing paradigm that the energy trade-off between reproduction and somatic maintenance causes organismal senescence via slow accumulation of unrepaired cellular damage with age. The emerging new theory of ageing provides a conceptually novel framework by proposing that ageing is a direct consequence of physiological processes optimized for early-life function, such as growth and early-life reproduction, that are running  too high (i.e. at hyperfunction) in late adulthood. Contrary to the classic view based on damage accumulation, the hyperfunction theory proposes that suboptimal gene expression in late-life causes ageing via excessive biosynthesis. Thus, the hyperfunction theory uniquely predicts that longevity and Darwinian fitness can be simultaneously increased by reducing unnecessarily high levels of nutrient-sensing signalling in adulthood. Here we show that reducing evolutionarily conserved nutrient-sensing signalling pathway fulfils this prediction in Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. We found that downregulation of the insulin/IGF-1 signalling in adult C. elegans nematodes not only improves longevity but, most intriguingly, increases fitness of the resulting offspring in the next generation. We found support for increase in offspring fitness across different genetic backgrounds. Our findings contradict the theoretical conjecture that energy trade-offs between growth, reproduction and longevity is the universal cause of senescence and provide strong experimental support for the emerging hyperfunction theory of ageing.",

    "abstract": "Despite sharing a common architecture with archetypal voltage-gated ion channels (VGIC), the hyperpolarization- and cyclic AMP-activated ion (HCN) channels open upon hyperpolarization rather than depolarization. The basic motions of voltage sensor and pore gates are conserved implying that these domains are inversely coupled in HCN channels. Using structure-guided protein engineering, we systematically assembled an array of mosaic channels that display the full complement of voltage-activation phenotypes observed in the VGIC superfamily. Our studies reveal that the voltage-sensing S3b-S4 transmembrane segment of the HCN channel has an intrinsic ability to drive pore opening in either direction. Specific contacts at the pore-voltage sensor interface and unique interactions near the pore gate forces the HCN channel into a hERG-like inactivated state, thereby obscuring their opening upon depolarization. Our findings reveal an unexpected common principle underpinning voltage gating in the VGIC superfamily and identify the essential determinants of gating polarity.",

    "abstract": "A study pertinent to the numerical modeling of cortical neurostimulation is conducted in an effort to compare the performance of the finite element method (FEM) and an original formulation of the boundary element fast multipole method (BEM-FMM) at matched computational performance metrics. We consider two problems: (i) a canonic multi-sphere geometry and an external magnetic-dipole excitation where the analytical solution is available and; (ii) a problem with realistic head models excited by a realistic coil geometry. In the first case, the FEM algorithm tested is a fast open-source getDP solver running within the SimNIBS 2.1.1 environment. In the second case, a high-end commercial FEM software package ANSYS Maxwell 3D is used. The BEM-FMM method runs in the MATLAB(R) 2018a environment.\\n\\nIn the first case, we observe that the BEM-FMM algorithm gives a smaller solution error for all mesh resolutions and runs significantly faster for high-resolution meshes when the number of triangular facets exceeds approximately 0.25 M. We present other relevant simulation results such as volumetric mesh generation times for the FEM, time necessary to compute the potential integrals for the BEM-FMM, and solution performance metrics for different hardware/operating system combinations. In the second case, we observe an excellent agreement for electric field distribution across different cranium compartments and, at the same time, a speed improvement of three orders of magnitude when the BEM-FMM algorithm used.\\n\\nThis study may provide a justification for anticipated use of the BEM-FMM algorithm for high-resolution realistic transcranial magnetic stimulation scenarios.",

There are multiple factors that contribute to selecting for the microbiome, key of which are host genetics. Flavobacterium psychrophillum, the causative agent of Bacterial Cold Water Disease in salmonids, accounts for acute losses in wild and farmed Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The U.S. National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture has used family-based selective breeding to generate a line of rainbow trout with enhanced resistance to F. psychrophilum. The goal of this study is to determine whether selective breeding impacts the gut and gill microbiome of the F. psychrophilum-resistant as compared to a background matched susceptible trout line. Mid-gut and gill samples were collected from juvenile fish (mean bwt 118g) and microbial diversity assessed by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Results indicate that alpha diversity was significantly higher in the mid-gut of the susceptible line compared to the resistant line, while no significant differences in alpha diversity were observed in the gills. Mycoplasma sp. was the dominant taxon in the mid-gut of both groups, although it was present at a decreased abundance in the susceptible line. We also observed an increased abundance of taxa that could potentially be pathogenic in the susceptible line, including Brevinema sp. and Enterobacteriaceae members. Within the gills, both lines exhibited similar microbial profiles, with Candidatus Branchiomonas being the dominant taxon. Together, these results suggest that selectively bred Flavobacterium psychrophillum-resistant trout may harness a more resilient gut microbiome, attributing to the disease resistant phenotype, providing a framework for future experiments.",

    "abstract": "The cerebral cortex of awake animals exhibits frequent transitions between diverse non-rhythmic network states. However, it is still unclear how these different activity states emerge within the same network and how each state impacts network function. Here, we demonstrate that model networks of spiking neurons with moderate recurrent interactions dynamically change their asynchronous dynamics depending upon the level of afferent excitation. We found that the model network displayed a spectrum of asynchronous states, ranging from afferent input-dominated (AD) regimes, characterized by unbalanced synaptic currents and sparse firing, to recurrent input-dominated (RD) regimes, characterized by balanced synaptic currents and dense firing. The model predicted regime-specific relationships between several different neural biophysical properties which were all experimentally confirmed by intracellular recordings in the somatosensory cortex of awake mice. Moreover, theoretical analysis showed that AD regimes more precisely encode spatiotemporal patterns of presynaptic activity, while RD regimes better encoded the strength of afferent inputs. These results provide a theoretical foundation for how recurrent neocortical circuits generate non-rhythmic waking states and how these different states modulate the processing of incoming information.",

In this study we investigated how high-fat diet intake impacts the maternal gut microbiota, intestinal inflammation and gut barrier integrity, placental inflammation, and fetal intestinal development at E18.5. High-fat diet (HFD) was associated with decreased relative abundancesof SCFA producing genera during pregnancy. These diet-induced shifts paralleled decreased maternal intestinal mRNA levels of SCFA receptor Gpr41, modestly decreased cecal butyrate, and altered mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines and immune cell markers in the maternal intestine.

HFD exposed fetuses had increased activation of NF-{kappa}B and inhibition of the unfolded protein response in the developing intestine.

Successful invasion of the host relies on producing a threshold amount of toxin, after which there is no benefit from producing more toxin. Consequently, the production of Cry toxin appears to be a different type of social problem compared with the public goods scenarios that bacteria often encounter. We show that selection for toxin production is a volunteers dilemma. We make the specific predictions that: (1) selection for toxin production depends upon an interplay between the number of bacterial cells that each host ingests, and the genetic relatedness between those cells; (2) cheats that do not produce toxin gain an advantage when at low frequencies, and at high bacterial density, allowing them to be maintained in a population alongside toxin producing cells.

We demonstrate through multiple approaches in vivo that the mechanism underlying these mitochondrial changes are dependent on eye opening and associated neuronal activity, which can be mimicked by brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We report downstream gene and protein expression changes consistent with mitochondrial biogenesis and energetics pathways, and present evidence that the associated transcripts are localized and translated at mitochondria within axons in an activity-dependent manner. Together these data support a novel model for mitochondrial-localized translation in support of intra-axonal mitochondrial dynamics and axonal maturation.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide phylogeny reconstruction is becoming increasingly common, and one driving factor behind these phylogenomic studies is the promise that the potential discordance between gene trees and the species tree can be modeled. Incomplete lineage sorting is one cause of discordance that bridges population genetic and phylogenetic processes. ASTRAL is a species tree reconstruction method that seeks to find the tree with minimum quartet distance to an input set of inferred gene trees. However, the published ASTRAL algorithm only works with one sample per species. To account for polymorphisms in present-day species, one can sample multiple individuals per species to create multi-allele datasets. Here, we introduce how ASTRAL can handle multi-allele datasets. We show that the quartet-based optimization problem extends naturally, and we introduce heuristic methods for building the search space specifically for the case of multi-individual datasets. We study the accuracy and scalability of the multi-individual version of ASTRAL-III using extensive simulation studies and compare it to NJst, the only other scalable method that can handle these datasets. We do not find strong evidence that using multiple individuals dramatically improves accuracy. When we study the trade-off between sampling more genes versus more individuals, we find that sampling more genes is more effective than sampling more individuals, even under conditions that we study where trees are shallow (median length: {approx} 1Ne) and ILS is extremely high.",

Previous conventional optical microscopy studies observing the intracellular distribution of rotavirus proteins and their organization in VPs have lacked molecular-scale spatial resolution, due to inherent spatial resolution constraints. In this work we employed super-resolution microscopy to reveal the nanometric-scale organization of VPs formed during rotavirus infection, and quantitatively describe the structural organization of seven viral proteins and viral dsRNA within and around the VPs. The observed viral components are spatially organized as 6 concentric layers, in which NSP5 localizes at the center of the VPs, surrounded by a layer of NSP2 and NSP4 proteins, followed by an intermediate zone comprised of the VP1, VP2, VP6 proteins and the dsRNA. In the outermost zone, we observed a ring of VP4 and finally a layer of VP7. These findings show that rotavirus VPs are highly organized organelles.",

Humans and mice that carry a truncated version of MPDZ incur severe hydrocephalus resulting in acute morbidity and lethality. We show by magnetic resonance imaging that contrast-medium penetrates into the brain ventricles of mice carrying a Mpdz loss-of-function mutation, whereas none is detected in the ventricles of normal mice, implying that the permeability of the choroid plexus epithelial cell monolayer is abnormally high. Comparative proteomic analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid of normal and hydrocephalic mice revealed up to a 53-fold increase in protein concentration, suggesting that transcytosis through the choroid plexus epithelial cells of Mpdz KO mice is substantially higher than in normal mice. These conclusions are supported by ultrastructural evidence, and by immunohistochemistry and cytology data. Our results provide a straight-forward and concise explanation for the pathophysiology of Mpdz-linked hydrocephalus.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic associations impact and are impacted by their surrounding ecosystem. The association between Burkholderia bacteria and the soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a tractable model to unravel the biology underlying symbiont-endowed phenotypes and their impacts. Several Burkholderia species stably associate with D. discoideum and typically reduce host fitness in food-rich environments while increasing fitness in food-scarce environments. Burkholderia symbionts are themselves inedible to their hosts but induce co-infections with secondary bacteria that can serve as a food source. Thus, Burkholderia hosts are \\\"farmers\\\" that carry food bacteria to new environments, providing a benefit when food is scarce. We examined the ability of specific Burkholderia genotypes to induce secondary co-infections and assessed host fitness under a range of co-infection conditions and environmental contexts. Although all Burkholderia symbionts intracellularly infected Dictyostelium, we found that co-infections are predominantly extracellular, suggesting that farming benefits are derived from extracellular infection of host structures. Furthermore, levels of secondary infection are linked to conditional host fitness; B. agricolaris infected hosts have the highest level of co-infection and have the highest fitness in food scarce environments. This study illuminates the phenomenon of co-infection induction across Dictyostelium associated Burkholderia species and exemplifies the contextual complexity of these associations.",

    "abstract": "The great gerbil (Rhombomys opimus) is a social rodent living in permanent, complex burrow systems distributed throughout Central Asia, where it serves as the main host of several important vector-borne infectious diseases and is defined as a key reservoir species for plague (Yersinia pestis). Studies from the wild have shown that the great gerbil is largely resistant to plague but the genetic basis for resistance is yet to be determined. Here, we present a highly contiguous annotated genome assembly of great gerbil, covering over 96 % of the estimated 2.47 Gb genome. Comparative genomic analyses focusing on the immune gene repertoire, reveal shared gene losses within TLR gene families (i.e. TLR8, TLR10 and all members of TLR11-subfamily) for the Gerbillinae lineage, accompanied with signs of diversifying selection of TLR7 and TLR9. Most notably, we find a great gerbil-specific duplication of the MHCII DRB locus. In silico analyses suggest that the duplicated gene provides high peptide binding affinity for Yersiniae epitopes. The great gerbil genome provides new insights into the genomic landscape that confers immunological resistance towards plague. The high affinity for Yersinia epitopes could be key in our understanding of the high resistance in great gerbils, putatively conferring a faster initiation of the adaptive immune response leading to survival of the infection. Our study demonstrates the power of studying zoonosis in natural hosts through the generation of a genome resource for further comparative and experimental work on plague survival and evolution of host-pathogen interactions.",

A self-administered pre-test close ended Amharic questionnaire at school setting was used for data collection. The coding was done using the original English version and entered to EPI-7 software. The quantitative file exported to statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 25.0 software for analysis. Total mean score was used to categorize individuals as good and poor while AOR; 95% CI with p < 0.05 was used to determine factors of menstrual hygiene management practice.\\n\\nResultThis study had 98% response rate. 530 (70.1%) and 388(51.3%) respondents had good knowledge and practice of menstrual hygiene respectively. The findings also showed a significant positive association between good knowledge of menstruation and girls from mothers whose education were secondary (AOR = 10.012, 95 % CI = 3.628-27.629). Wealth index quantile five (AOR = 9.038, 95 % CI = 3.728-21.909) revealed significant positive association with good practice of menstrual hygiene.\\n\\nConclusion and recommendationMajority of participants had good knowledge and practice of menstrual hygiene and majority of them were from private school.

The current state of the art in training machines to classify wildlife species from camera-trap data is to employ convolutional neural networks (CNN) encoded within deep learning algorithms. Here we report on results obtained in training a CNN to classify 20 African wildlife species with an overall accuracy of 87.5% from a dataset containing 111,467 images. We then used a gradient-weighted class-activation-mapping (Grad-CAM) procedure to extract the most salient pixels in the final convolution layer. We show that these pixels highlight features in particular images that are in most, but not all, cases similar to those used to train humans to identify these species. Further, we used mutual information methods to identify the neurons in the final convolution layer that consistently respond most strongly across a set of images of one particular species, and we then interpret the features in the image where the strongest responses occur. We also used hierarchical clustering of feature vectors (i.e., the state of the final fully-connected layer in the CNN) associated with each image to produce a visual similarity dendrogram of identified species. Finally, we evaluated how images that were not part of the training set fell within our dendrogram when these images were one of the 20 species \\\"known\\\" to our CNN in contrast to where they fell when these images were \\\"unknown\\\" to our CNN.",

Here, we determined the effects of IgA deficiency on human gut microbiota composition and evaluated the possibility that secretion of IgM can compensate for a lack of secretory IgA. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bacterial cell sorting to evaluate gut microbiota composition and IgA or IgM coating of the gut microbiota in 15 sIgAd subjects and 15 matched controls. Although sIgAd subjects secreted a significant amount of IgM into the intestinal lumen, this was insufficient to fully compensate for the lack of secretory IgA. Indeed, sIgAd subjects displayed an altered gut microbiota composition as compared to healthy controls, which was characterized by a trend towards decreased overall microbial diversity and significant shifts in the relative abundances of specific microbial taxa. While IgA targets a defined subset of the microbiota via high-level coating, compensatory IgM binds a broader subset of the microbiota in a less targeted manner. We conclude that IgA plays a critical and non-redundant role in controlling gut microbiota composition in humans and that secretory IgA has evolved to maintain a diverse and stable gut microbial community that promotes human health, enhances resistance to infection, and is resilient to perturbation.",

    "abstract": "Norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi), two key biogenic monoamine neurotransmitters, are involved in a wide range of physiological processes. However, their precise dynamics and regulation remain poorly characterized, in part due to limitations of available techniques for measuring these molecules in vivo. Here, we developed a family of GPCR Activation-Based NE/Epi (GRABNE) sensors with a 230% peak {Delta}F/F0 response to NE, good photostability, nanomolar-to-micromolar sensitivities, sub-second rapid kinetics, high specificity to NE vs. dopamine. Viral- or transgenic- mediated expression of GRABNE sensors were able to detect electrical-stimulation evoked NE release in the locus coeruleus (LC) of mouse brain slices, looming-evoked NE release in the midbrain of live zebrafish, as well as optogenetically and behaviorally triggered NE release in the LC and hypothalamus of freely moving mice. Thus, GRABNE sensors are a robust tool for rapid and specific monitoring of in vivo NE/Epi transmission in both physiological and pathological processes.",

    "abstract": "Our motor commands can be exquisitely timed according to the demands of the environment, and the ability to generate rhythms of different tempos is a hallmark of musical cognition. Yet, the neuronal basis behind rhythmic tapping remains elusive. Here we found that the activity of hundreds of primate MPC neurons show a strong periodic pattern that becomes evident when their activity is projected into a lower dimensional state space. We show that different tempos are encoded by circular trajectories that travelled at a constant speed but with different radii, and that this neuronal code is highly resilient to the number of participating neurons. Crucially, the changes in the amplitude of the oscillatory dynamics in neuronal state space are a signature of beat-based timing, regardless of whether it is guided by an external metronome or is internally controlled and is not the result of repetitive motor commands. Furthermore, the increase in amplitude and variability of the neural trajectories accounted for the scalar property of interval timing. In addition, we found that the interval-dependent increments in the radius of periodic neural trajectories are the result of larger number of neurons engaged in the production of longer intervals. Our results support the notion that beat-based timing during rhythmic behaviors is encoded in the radial curvature of periodic MPC neural population trajectories.",

    "abstract": "It has been discovered that the development of schistosome is hampered in immunodeficient mice, e.g. nude mice lacking T-lymphocytes and the severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice lacking both T- and B-lymphocytes. However, its still unresolved about the underlying regulatory mechanisms of the retarded growth and development of schistosomes in their immunodeficient definitive host. In this study, therefore, five replicates of male or female Schistosoma japonicum samples with twenty male or female worms in each sample, were collected from SCID mice or BALB/c mice at five weeks post infection and used to perform metabonomic analysis using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) platform, for elucidating the growth and development regulation of schistosome in their definitive hosts from the metabolomic aspect. Based on the identified 1015 ion features in ESI+ mode and 342 ion features in ESI-mode, multivariate modelling methods including the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) identified distinct metabolic profiles that clearly differentiated both male and female worms in SCID mice from those in BALB/c mice, respectively. Common and uniquely perturbed metabolites and their involved metabolic pathways were identified in male and female worms from SCID mice when compared with those from BALB/c mice. The results also revealed that more differential metabolites were found in female worms (one metabolite was up-regulated and forty metabolites were down-regulated) than male worms (nine metabolites were up-regulated and twenty metabolites were down-regulated) between SCID mice and BALB/c mice. The top five increased metabolites of male worms in SCID mice when compared with those in BALB/c mice were PC(22:6/20:1), L-allothreonine, L-serine, glycerophosphocholine and 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide. And the top five decreased metabolites of male worms in SCID mice when compared with those in BALB/c mice were PC(16:0/0:0), PAF C-16, PE(18:1/0:0), adenosine and butenoyl PAF. Most of the differential metabolites of female worms in SCID mice had lower levels when compared with the normal female worms in BALB/c mice, except for retinyl ester with a higher level. The top five decreased metabolites of female worms in SCID mice when compared with those in BALB/c mice were adrenic acid, 5-phosphoribosylamine, PC(16:0/0:0), PC(22:6/20:1) and ergothioneine. The involved metabolic pathways of the differential metabolites in male worms between SCID mice and BALB/c mice mainly included taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, etc. The involved metabolic pathways of differential metabolites in female worms included mainly pyrimidine metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, etc. These findings suggested a correlation between the retarded growth and development of schistosome in SCID mice and their perturbed metabolic profiles, which also provided a new insight into the regulation mechanisms of growth and development of S. japonicum worms from the metabolic level, and provided clues for discovery of drugs or vaccines against the parasites and parasitic disease.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe growth and development of schistosome has been discovered hampered in the immunodeficient hosts.

    "abstract": "A plethora of experimental studies have shown that long-term plasticity can be expressed pre- or postsynaptically depending on a range of factors such as developmental stage, synapse type, and activity patterns. The functional consequences of this diversity are unknown. However, in models of neuronal learning, long-term synaptic plasticity is implemented as changes in connective weights. Whereas postsynaptic expression of plasticity predominantly affects synaptic response amplitude, presynaptic expression alters both synaptic response amplitude and short-term dynamics. In other words, the consideration of long-term plasticity as a fixed change in amplitude corresponds more closely to post- than to presynaptic expression, which means theoretical outcomes based on this choice of implementation may have a postsynaptic bias. To explore the functional implications of the diversity of expression of long-term synaptic plasticity, we modelled spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) such that it was expressed either pre- or postsynaptically, or both. We tested pair-based standard STDP models and a biologically tuned triplet STDP model, and investigated the outcome in a feed-forward setting, with two different learning schemes: either inputs were triggered at different latencies, or a subset of inputs were temporally correlated. Across different STDP models and learning paradigms, we found that presynaptic changes adjusted the speed of learning, while postsynaptic expression was better at regulating spike timing and frequency. When combining both expression loci, postsynaptic changes amplified the response range, while presynaptic plasticity maintained control over postsynaptic firing rates, potentially providing a form of activity homeostasis. Our findings highlight how the seemingly innocuous choice of implementing synaptic plasticity by direct weight modification may unwittingly introduce a postsynaptic bias in modelling outcomes. We conclude that pre- and postsynaptically expressed plasticity are not interchangeable, but enable complimentary functions.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of fins into limbs was a key transition in vertebrate history. A hallmark of this transition is the addition of multiple long bones to the proximal-distal axis of paired appendages. Whereas limb skeletons are often elaborate and diverse, teleost pectoral fins retain a simple endoskeleton. Fins and limbs share many core developmental processes, but how these programs were reshaped to produce limbs from fins during evolution remains enigmatic. Here we identify zebrafish mutants that form supernumerary long bones along the proximal-distal axis of pectoral fins with limb-like patterning. These new skeletal elements are integrated into the fin, as they are connected to the musculature, form joints, and articulate with neighboring bones. This phenotype is caused by activating mutations in previously unrecognized regulators of appendage development, vav2 and waslb, which we show function in a common pathway. We find that this pathway functions in appendage development across vertebrates, and loss of Wasl in developing limbs results in patterning defects identical to those seen in Hoxall knockout mice. Concordantly, formation of supernumerary fin long bones requires the function of hoxall paralogs, indicating developmental homology with the forearm and the existence of a latent functional Hox code patterning the fin endoskeleton. Our findings reveal an inherent limb-like patterning ability in fins that can be activated by simple genetic perturbation, resulting in the elaboration of the endoskeleton.",

    "abstract": "Advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies coupled with increased interdisciplinary collaboration is rapidly expanding capacity in the scope and scale of wildlife genetic studies. While existing HTS methods can be directly applied to address some evolutionary and ecological questions, certain research goals necessitate tailoring methods to specific study organisms, such as high-throughput genotyping of the same loci that are comparable over large spatial and temporal scales. These needs are particularly common for studies of highly mobile species of conservation concern like marine turtles, where life history traits, limited financial resources and other constraints require affordable, adaptable methods for HTS genotyping to meet a variety of study goals. Here, we present a versatile marine turtle HTS targeted enrichment platform adapted from the recently developed Rapture (RAD-Capture) method specifically designed to meet these research needs. Our results demonstrate consistent enrichment of targeted regions throughout the genome and discovery of candidate variants in all species examined for use in various conservation genetics applications. Accurate species identification confirmed the ability of our platform to genotype over 1,000 multiplexed samples, and identified areas for future methodological improvement such as optimization for low initial concentration samples. Finally, analyses within green turtles supported the ability of this platform to identify informative SNPs for stock structure, population assignment and other applications over a broad geographic range of interest to management. This platform provides an additional tool for marine turtle genetic studies and broadens capacity for future large-scale initiatives such as collaborative global marine turtle genetic databases.",

    "abstract": "Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are double stranded DNA viruses causative in a host of human diseases including several cancers. Following infection two viral proteins, E1 and E2, activate viral replication in association with cellular factors, and stimulate the DNA damage response (DDR) during the replication process. E1-E2 uses homologous replication (HR) to facilitate DNA replication, but an understanding of host factors involved in this process remains incomplete. Previously we demonstrated that the class III deacetylase SIRT1, which can regulate HR, is recruited to E1-E2 replicating DNA and regulates the level of replication. Here we demonstrate that SIRT1 promotes the fidelity of E1-E2 replication and that the absence of SIRT1 results in reduced recruitment of the DNA repair protein Werner helicase (WRN) to E1-E2 replicating DNA. CRISPR/Cas9 editing demonstrates that WRN, like SIRT1, regulates the quantity and fidelity of E1-E2 replication. This is the first report of WRN regulation of E1-E2 DNA replication, or a role for WRN in the HPV life cycle. In the absence of SIRT1 there is an increased acetylation and stability of WRN, but a reduced ability to interact with E1-E2 replicating DNA. We present a model in which E1-E2 replication turns on the DDR stimulating SIRT1 deacetylation of WRN. This deacetylation promotes WRN interaction with E1-E2 replicating DNA to control the quantity and fidelity of replication. As well as offering a crucial insight into HPV replication control, this system offers a unique model for investigating the link between SIRT1 and WRN in controlling replication in mammalian cells.\\n\\nImportanceHPV16 is the major viral human carcinogen, responsible for between 3 and 4% of all cancers worldwide. Following infection this virus activates the DNA damage response (DDR) to promote its life cycle, and recruits DDR proteins to its replicating DNA in order to facilitate homologous recombination during replication. This promotes the production of viable viral progeny. Our understanding of how HPV16 replication interacts with the DDR remains incomplete. Here we demonstrate that the cellular deacetylase SIRT1, which is a part of the E1-E2 replication complex, regulates recruitment of the DNA repair protein WRN to the replicating DNA. We demonstrate that WRN regulates the level and fidelity of E1-E2 replication. Overall the results suggest a mechanism where SIRT1 deacetylation of WRN promotes its interaction with E1-E2 replicating DNA to control the levels and fidelity of that replication.",

The current study examined the mechanism of action of these two antimicrobial peptides against P. aeruginosa with a series of investigations. Antimicrobial activities were determined by MIC and MBC. Endotoxin neutralization was determined using the LAL assay, effect on the cytoplasmic membrane was evaluated using DiSC(3)-5 and Sytox green stains, and Syto-9 and PI dyes using flow cytometry. Release of cytoplasmic materials (ATP and DNA/RNA) were determined using ATP luminescence and increase in OD260nm. The ability to lyse bacteria was studied by measuring a decrease in OD620nm. The MIC of the peptides remained low against P. aeruginosa strains, which showed efficient neutralization of LPS, indicating their role in the anti-pseudomonas and LPS binding activities. Both AMPs rapidly (starting at 30 seconds) depolarized P. aeruginosa cytoplasmic membrane leading to reduction in viability. Melimine was responsible for more ATP release (75%) compared to Mel4 (36%) (P<0.001) following two minutes exposure. For both peptides, Sytox green entered cells after five minutes of incubation. Flow cytometry demonstrated that both the AMPs permeabilized the cell membrane at 30 minutes and followed by increasing permeability. Similar results were found with DNA/RNA release experiments. Overall, melimine showed higher ability of membrane disruption, cell lysis compared to Mel4 (P<0.001). Knowledge regarding mechanism of action of these two AMPs would be helpful in making them as anti-pseudomonas drug.",

    "abstract": "Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.",

    "abstract": "Drug intake is known to be under the influence of social context. We have recently shown that presence of a peer influences drug intake in both rats and humans. Whether or not social acoustic communications between the peers play a role during cocaine or sucrose self-administration (SA) was investigated here, using playback of ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) at 50- and 22-kHz, conveying respectively positive and negative internal affective states in adult rats. To assess the neurobiological substrate of a potential USV influence on drug and food intake, we tested the effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) lesions, given its role in emotional and motivational processes. In sham-control rats, playback of USV associated with positive affective states induced long-term decreased cocaine consumption, while USV associated with negative affective states induced short-term increase. Interestingly, no effect of USV playback was observed on sucrose intake, whatever the frequency. STN lesions abolished the influence of USV on cocaine intake, highlighting the influence of STN in emotional processes induced by USV emitted by a peer. These results show how acoustic social communication is important to regulate drug intake in rats and how STN modulation could interfere with addiction processes.",

    "abstract": "The neural correlates of specific brain functions such as visual orientation tuning and individual finger movements can be revealed using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data. Neurofeedback based on these distributed patterns of brain activity presents a unique ability for precise neuromodulation. Recent applications of this technique, known as decoded neurofeedback, have manipulated fear conditioning, visual perception, confidence judgements and facial preference. However, there has yet to be an empirical justification of the timing and data processing parameters of these experiments. Suboptimal parameter settings could impact the efficacy of neurofeedback learning and contribute to the 'non-responder' effect. The goal of this study was to investigate how design parameters of decoded neurofeedback experiments affect decoding accuracy and neurofeedback performance. Subjects participated in three fMRI sessions: two 'finger localizer' sessions to identify the fMRI patterns associated with each of the four fingers of the right hand, and one 'finger finding' neurofeedback session to assess neurofeedback performance. Using only the localizer data, we show that real-time decoding can be degraded by poor experiment timing or ROI selection. To set key parameters for the neurofeedback session, we used offline simulations of decoded neurofeedback using data from the localizer sessions to predict neurofeedback performance. We show that these predictions align with real neurofeedback performance at the group level and can also explain individual differences in neurofeedback success. Overall, this work demonstrates the usefulness of offline simulation to improve the success of real-time decoded neurofeedback experiments.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences in gene expression are important contributors to normal physiology and mechanisms of disease. This is increasingly apparent in understanding and potentially treating chronic pain where molecular mechanisms driving sex differences in neuronal plasticity are giving new insight into why certain chronic pain disorders preferentially affect women versus men. Large transcriptomic resources are increasingly available and can be used to mine for sex differences and molecular insight using donor cohorts. We analyzed more than 250 human tibial nerve (hTN) transcriptomes from the GTex Consortium project to gain insight into sex-dependent gene expression in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). We discover 149 genes with sex differential expression. Many of the genes upregulated in men are associated with inflammation, and appear to be primarily expressed by glia or immune cells. In women, we find the differentially upregulated transcription factor SP4 that drives a regulatory program, and may impact sex differences in PNS physiology. Many of these 149 DE genes have some previous association with chronic pain but few of them have been explored thoroughly. Additionally, using clinical data in the GTex database, we identify a subset of differentially expressed (DE) genes in diseases associated with chronic pain, arthritis and type II diabetes. Our work identifies sexually dimorphic gene expression in the human PNS with implications for discovery of sex-specific pain mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Cycles, such as seasons or tides, characterize many systems in nature. Overwhelming evidence shows that climate change-driven alterations to environmental cycles--such as longer seasons-- are associated with phenological shifts around the world, suggesting a deep link between environmental cycles and life cycles. However, general mechanisms of life history evolution in cyclical environments are still not well understood. Here I build a demographic framework and ask how life history strategies optimize fitness when the environment perturbs a structured population cyclically, and how strategies should change as cyclicality changes. I show that cycle periodicity alters optimality predictions of classic life history theory because repeated cycles have rippling selective consequences over time and generations. Notably, fitness landscapes that relate environmental cyclicality and life history optimality vary dramatically depending on which trade-offs govern a given species. The model tuned with known life history trade-offs in a marine intertidal copepod T. californicus successfully predicted the shape of life history variation across natural populations spanning a gradient of tidal periodicities. This framework shows how environmental cycles can drive life history variation--without complex assumptions of individual responses to cues such as temperature--thus expanding the range of life history diversity explained by theory and providing a basis for adaptive phenology.",

The regulated transcription initiation in response to various environmental cues in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae has not been systematically investigated. In this study, we generated quantitative maps of transcription start site (TSS) at a single-nucleotide resolution for S. cerevisiae grown in nine different conditions using no-amplification non-tagging Cap analysis of gene expression (nAnT-iCAGE) sequencing. Based on 337 million uniquely mapped CAGE tags, we mapped ~1 million well-supported TSSs, suggesting highly pervasive transcription initiation in the compact genome of yeast. The comprehensive TSS maps allowed us to identify core promoters for ~96% verified protein-coding genes and to revise the predicted translation start codon for 183 genes. We found that 56% of yeast genes have at least two core promoters and alternative usage of different core promoters in a gene is widespread in response to changing environments. More importantly, most core promoter shifts are coupled with differential gene expression, indicating that core promoter shift might play an important role in controlling transcriptional activity of yeast genes. Based on their dynamic activities, we divided yeast core promoters as constitutive core promoters (55%) and inducible core promoters (45%). The two classes of core promoters exhibit distinctive patterns in transcriptional abundance, chromatin structure, promoter shape, and sequence context. In summary, the quantitative TSS maps generated by this study improved the annotation of yeast genome, and revealed a highly pervasive and dynamic nature of transcription initiation in yeast.",

    "abstract": "Golden Ratio proportions are found throughout the world of multicellular organisms but the underlying mechanisms behind their appearance and their adaptive value if any remain unknown. The Golden Ratio is a real-valued number but cell population counts are whole numbered. Binet's formula connects the Golden Ratio to the whole numbered Fibonacci sequence (fn+1 = fn + fn-1 where f1 = 1 and f2 = 2), so we seek a cellular mechanism that yields Fibonacci cell kinetics. Drawing on Fibonaccis description of growth patterns in rabbits, we develop a matrix model of Fibonacci cell kinetics based on an asymmetric pause between mitoses by daughter cells. We list candidate molecular mechanisms for asymmetric mitosis such as epigenetically asymmetric chromosomal sorting at anaphase due to cytosine-DNA methylation. A collection of Fibonacci-sized cell groups produced each by mitosis needs to assemble into a larger multicellular structure. We find that the mathematics for this assembly are afforded by a simple molecular cell surface configuration where each cell in each group has four cell to cell adhesion slots. Two slots internally cohere a cell group and two adhere to cells in other cell groups. We provide a notation for expressing each cells participation in dual Fibonacci recurrence relations. We find that single class of cell to cell adhesion molecules suffices to hold together a large assembly of chained Fibonacci groups having Golden Ratio patterns. Specialized bindings between components of various sizes are not required. Furthermore, the notation describes circumstances where chained Fibonacci-sized cell groups may leave adhesion slots unoccupied unless the chained groups anneal into a ring. This unexpected result suggests a role for Fibonacci cell kinetics in the formation of multicellular ring forms such as hollow and tubular structures. In this analysis, a complex molecular pattern behind asymmetric mitosis coordinates with a simple molecular cell adhesion pattern to generate useful multicellular assemblies. Furthermore, this reductively unifies two of the hypothesized evolutionary steps: multicellularity and cellular eusociality.",

The mutation spectrum of these samples showed a high concordance with TCGA and other studies on GC. We found the alterations of 17 DNA repair genes (including BRCA2, POLE and MSH3, etc.) were strongly correlated with the tumor mutation burden (TMB) and tumor neoantigen burden (TNB) of GC patients. Patients with mutations of these genes tend to have high TMB (median of TMB = 12.77, p=2.3e-6) and TNB (median of TNB = 5.97, p= 2.8e-3). In addition, younger GC patients (age < 60) have lower TMB (p = 0.0021) and TNB (p = 0.034) than older patients (age >= 60). Furthermore, we found a list of 18 genes and two genomic regions (1p36.21 and Xq26.3) were associated with peritoneal metastasis (PM) of GC, and patients with amplification of 1p36.21 and Xq26.3 have a worse prognosis (p=0.002, 0.01, respectively).

To control hospital-associated infections, skin antisepsis and bathing utilizing chlorhexidine is recommended for VRE patients in acute care hospitals. Previously, we reported that exposure to inhibitory chlorhexidine levels induced the expression of vancomycin resistance genes in VanA-type Enterococcus faecium. However, vancomycin susceptibility actually increased for VanA-type E. faecium in the presence of chlorhexidine. Hence, a synergistic effect of the two antimicrobials was observed. In this study, we used multiple approaches to investigate the mechanism of synergism between chlorhexidine and vancomycin in the VanA-type VRE strain E. faecium 1,231,410. We generated clean deletions of 7 of 11 pbp, transpeptidase, and carboxypeptidase genes in this strain (ponA, pbpF, pbpZ, pbpA, ddcP, ldtfm, and vanY). Deletion of ddcP, encoding a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase, altered the synergism phenotype. Furthermore, using in vitro evolution, we isolated a spontaneous synergy escaper mutant and utilized whole genome sequencing to determine that a mutation in pstB, encoding an ATPase of phosphate-specific transporters, also altered synergism. Finally, addition of excess D-lactate, but not D-alanine, enhanced synergism. Overall, our work identified factors that alter chlorhexidine-induced vancomycin resensitization in a model VanA-type VRE strain.",

While the groups showed similar initial learning, only controls exhibited evidence of sleep-dependent consolidation. These results demonstrate that the hippocampus can be required for normal consolidation of a task without being required for its acquisition, suggesting that the area plays a broader role in coordinating sleep-dependent memory consolidation than has previously been assumed.",

    "abstract": "In the somatosensory nerves, the tactile perception of texture is driven by spatial and temporal patterns of activation distributed across three populations of afferents. These disparate streams of information must then be integrated centrally to achieve a unified percept of texture. To investigate the representation of texture in somatosensory cortex, we scanned a wide range of natural textures across the fingertips of Rhesus macaques and recorded the responses evoked in Brodmann's areas 3b, 1, and 2. We found that texture identity is reliably encoded in the idiosyncratic responses of populations of cortical neurons, giving rise to a high-dimensional representation of texture. Cortical neurons fall along a continuum in their sensitivity to fine vs. coarse texture, and neurons at the extrema of this continuum seem to receive their major input from different afferent populations. Finally, we show that cortical responses can account for several aspects of texture perception in humans.",

Our focus is on the nuclear pore complex (NPC), as well-known nanoscale component endowed of a preserved and symmetrical structure localized on the nuclear envelope. Here, we show that Nup153 is a good reporter to quantitatively address the isotropy of the expansion process.

    "abstract": "Age-related impairment of muscle function severely affects the health of an increasing elderly population. While causality and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, exercise is an efficient intervention to blunt these aging effects. We thus investigated the role of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {gamma} coactivator 1 (PGC-1), a potent regulator of mitochondrial function and exercise adaptation, in skeletal muscle during aging. We demonstrate that PGC-1 overexpression improves mitochondrial dynamics and calcium buffering in an estrogen-related receptor  (ERR)-dependent manner. Moreover, we show that sarcoplasmic reticulum stress is attenuated by PGC-1. As a result, PGC-1 prevents tubular aggregate formation and fiber apoptosis in old muscle. Similarly, the pro-apoptotic effects of ceramide and thapsigargin were blunted by PGC-1 in muscle cells. Accordingly, mice with muscle-specific gain- and loss-of-function of PGC-1 exhibit a delayed and premature aging phenotype, respectively. Together, our data reveal a key protective effect of PGC-1 on muscle function and overall health span in aging.\\n\\nStatement of significanceThe loss of muscle function in aging results in a massive impairment in life quality, e.g. by reducing motor function, strength, endurance, the ability to perform daily tasks or social interactions. Unfortunately, the mechanistic aspects underlying age-related muscle disorders remain poorly understood and treatments improving the disease are extremely limited. We now show that PGC-1, a transcriptional coactivator, is a key regulator of mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, cellular stress and death, all of which are linked to muscle aging and dysfunction. As a result, inhibition of the age-related decline in muscle PGC-1 considerably reduces aging of muscle and constitutes a promising target to prevent and treat the deterioration of muscle function in the elderly.\\n\\nAbbreviationsBNIP3, BCL2/Adenovirus E1B 19kDa interacting protein 3; Cpt1b, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B; CSQ1, calsequestrin 1; Drp1, dynamin-related protein 1; ER stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress; ERR, estrogen-related receptor ; Fis1, fission 1; GRP75, Glucose-Regulated Protein 75; IGFBP5, insulin like growth factor binding protein 5; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3R1, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1; Letm1, leucine zipper and EF-hand containing transmembrane protein 1; MAMs, mitochondria-associated ER membranes; Mcad, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; Opa1, optic atrophy 1; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; PGC-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {gamma} coactivator 1; pH2AX, phospho-H2A Histone Family Member X; ppRB, phospho-preproretinoblastoma-associated protein; Puma, BCL2 Binding Component 3; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; TA, tibialis anterior; TBP, TATA binding protein; TPG, thapsigargin; Ucp3, uncoupling protein 3; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel; XBP1, X-Box Binding Protein 1; Xiap, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein",

Protocol reliability and artefact identification are increasingly seen as important aspects of super-resolution microscopy. The reliability of these approaches thus requires in-depth evaluation so that biological findings are based on solid foundations. Here we explore how different fixation approaches that disrupt or preserve the actin cytoskeleton affect membrane protein organization. Using CD4 as a model, we show that fixation-mediated disruption of the actin cytoskeleton correlates with changes in CD4 membrane organization.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, approximately 70% of the paternal emb-27APC6 mutant embryonic cells contained more than 2 centrosomes and formed multipolar spindles. However, only 30% of the cells with tripolar spindles formed 2 cytokinetic furrows. The rest formed 1 furrow, like normal cells. To investigate the mechanism how the cells avoided to form 2 cytokinetic furrows even with a tripolar spindle, we conducted live-cell imaging in emb-27APC6 mutant cells. We found that the chromatids were aligned only on 2 of the 3 sides of the tripolar spindle, and the angle of the tripolar spindle relative to the long axis of the cell correlated with the number of cytokinetic furrow. Our numerical modeling showed that the combination of cell shape, cortical pulling forces, and heterogeneity of centrosome size determines whether cells with tripolar spindle form 1 or 2 cytokinetic furrows.",

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is efficient on other addiction criteria models and we show here that 30-Hz STN stimulation reduces pathological cocaine seeking in compulsive-like rats. This confirms STN DBS as a potential strategy to treat addiction. We also observed that only  compulsive-like rats displayed a progressive increase in STN low frequency oscillations, especially in the alpha/theta band (6-13 Hz), during cocaine escalation. Conversely, applying 8-Hz STN DBS to mimic alpha/theta oscillations in  non-compulsive animals changed them into  compulsive ones. We have thus identified a predictive neuronal biomarker of compulsivity.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common and malignant form of brain cancer. Its invasive nature limits treatment efficacy and promotes inevitable recurrence. Previous in vitro studies have shown that interstitial fluid flow, a factor characteristically increased in cancer, increases glioma cell invasion via CXCR4-CXCL12. It is currently unknown if these effects translate in vivo. Using the therapeutic technique of convection enhanced delivery (CED), we tested if convective flow alters glioma invasion in vivo using the syngeneic GL261 mouse model of glioblastoma. We first confirmed that GL261 invasion in vitro increased under flow in a CXCR4-CXCL12 dependent manner. Additionally, approximately 65.4% and 6.59% of GL261 express CXCR4 and CXCL12 in vivo, respectively, with 3.38% expressing both. Inducing convective flow within implanted tumors indeed increased glioma cell invasion over untreated controls, and administering CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 (5 mg/kg) effectively eliminated this response. Therefore, glioma invasion is in fact stimulated by convective flow in vivo through CXCR4. We also analyzed patient samples to show that expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12 increase in patients following therapy. These results suggesting that targeting flow-stimulated invasion may prove beneficial as a second line of therapy, particularly in patients chosen to receive convection enhanced drug delivery.",

We have recently demonstrated that circulating fibrocytes, a rare population of fibroblast-like cells produced by the bone marrow stroma, are increased in COPD patients during an exacerbation. It remains, however, unclear, whether fibrocytes are present in bronchial tissue of COPD patients.\\n\\nObjectiveWe aimed to quantify fibrocytes density in bronchial specimens from both control subjects and COPD patients, and to define associations with clinical, functional and computed tomography relevant parameters.\\n\\nMethods17 COPD patients and 25 control subjects with normal lung function testing and no chronic symptoms, all of them requiring thoracic surgery, were recruited. LFT and CT-scan were performed before surgery. Using co-immunostaining and image analysis, we identify CD45+ FSP1+ cells as tissue fibrocytes and quantify their density in distal and proximal bronchial specimens from the whole series.\\n\\nResultsHere, we demonstrate that fibrocytes are increased in both distal and proximal tissue specimens of COPD patients, compared to those of controls. The density of fibrocytes is negatively correlated with lung function parameters, such as FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, and positively with bronchial wall thickness assessed by CT scan. High density of distal bronchial fibrocytes predicts presence of COPD with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 70%.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results thus suggest that recruitment of fibrocytes in the bronchi may participate to lung function decline during COPD progression.\\n\\nClinical ImplicationsHigh density of tissue fibrocytes is associated with a deteriorated lung function and an increase in airway wall thickness. A low density tissue fibrocytes virtually eliminates the presence of COPD.\\n\\nCapsule summaryBlood fibrocytes assessed during exacerbation is a predictor of mortality in COPD.

    "abstract": "Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) is now a widely used therapeutic strategy, its precise mechanism remains largely unclear. Since this approach is progressively extended to treat non-motor disorders such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, the comprehension of its effects on motivated behaviors appears of the upmost importance for a possible application for addiction. In intact rats, we used inhibition and high frequency optogenetic activation of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons to test whether or not we could reproduce the effects of electric deep brain stimulation on rats motivation for sweet food and cocaine. Rats motivation was assessed using fixed-ratio 5 and progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement for both rewards and illumination was applied during behavioral testing. Efficiency of optogenetic manipulations has been validated using in-vitro electrophysiological recordings. Optogenetic inhibition of STN increased motivation for food and reduced motivation for cocaine. In contrast, optogenetic high frequency stimulation reduced the motivation for food without impacting motivation for cocaine. Optical inhibition mimics the effect of electric deep brain stimulation on food and cocaine motivation, confirming that the effects observed under electric DBS result from a specific inactivation of the STN. In contrast, optogenetic high frequency stimulation induces opposite effects to those of electric one, suggesting a stimulation of the STN that only seems to affect food motivation.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulated cholesterol metabolism is implicated in a number of neurological disorders. Many sterols, including cholesterol and its precursors and metabolites, are biologically active and important for proper brain function. However, spatial cholesterol metabolism in brain and the resulting sterol distributions are poorly defined. To better understand cholesterol metabolism in situ across the complex functional regions of brain, we have developed on-tissue enzyme-assisted derivatisation in combination with micro-liquid-extraction for surface analysis and liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry to image sterols in tissue slices (10 {micro}m) of mouse brain. The method provides sterolomic analysis at 400 {micro}m spot diameter with a limit of quantification of 0.01 ng/mm2. It overcomes the limitations of previous mass spectrometry imaging techniques in analysis of low abundance and difficult to ionise sterol molecules, allowing isomer differentiation and structure identification. Here we demonstrate the spatial distribution and quantification of multiple sterols involved in cholesterol metabolic pathways in wild type and cholesterol 24S-hydroxylase knock-out mouse brain. The technology described provides a powerful tool for future studies of spatial cholesterol metabolism in healthy and diseased tissues.\\n\\nSignificanceThe brain is a remarkably complex organ and cholesterol homeostasis underpins brain function. It is known that cholesterol is not evenly distributed across different brain regions, however, the precise map of cholesterol metabolism in the brain remains unclear. If cholesterol metabolism is to be correlated with brain function it is essential to generate such a map. Here we describe an advanced mass spectrometry imaging platform to reveal spatial cholesterol metabolism in situ at 400 {micro}m resolution on 10 {micro}m tissue slices from mouse brain. We mapped, not only cholesterol, but also other biologically active sterols arising from cholesterol turnover in both wild type and mice lacking cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (Cyp46a1), the major cholesterol metabolising enzyme.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs are a group of short non-coding RNAs that undertake various roles in different cell signaling pathways and developmental stages. They regulate gene expression levels at the post-transcriptional stage, which results in cleavage of mRNAs or repression of their translation. Some miRNAs, including the miR-302 cluster, are critical regulators for the stemness state of embryonic stem cells and cell fate patterning. The miR-302 cluster is located in the intron of a non-coding gene that has no other reported function, other than hosting miR-302, and grant a complex expression regulation through upstream its regulatory sequences. To date, analysis of the miR-302 expression pattern in a transgenic mouse model has not been reported. In this study, we generated transgenic mice that expressed EGFP driven by miR-302 upstream regulatory sequences that harbored the core promoter of its host gene. We examined the activity of the miR-302 promotor in somatic tissues of transgenic mice, transgenic blastocysts, and embryonic stem cells derived from transgenic blastocysts. Our results showed that miR-302 highly expressed in both blastocysts and the first passages of transgenic embryonic stem cells, and has low expression in the somatic tissues of transgenic mice. It could be concluded that different temporal and spatial gene expression patterns occur during the embryonic and adult stages in mice.",

    "abstract": "Tyrosine is precursor for monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine (DA), which is one of the key neurotransmitters in the frontostriatal network and of crucial relevance for mental disorders. Recent research reported that high dose tyrosine application resulted in increased brain DA synthesis, which is consistent with the observation of positive associations between daily tyrosine intake and cognitive test performance. In the present study, we investigated the associations between working memory (WM) dependent tasks and self-reported nutritional tyrosine intake within a large group of healthy elderly humans (286 subjects) by additionally including brain functional data. We observed a negative correlation between tyrosine intake and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the striatum (putamen) and the prefrontal cortex. That is to say, we found higher rsFC in individuals consuming less tyrosine per day. At the same time, this increased rsFC or hyperconnectivity was associated with lower WM performance. These findings suggest that lower or insufficient supply of tyrosine might result in dysfunctional connectivity between striatal and frontal regions leading to lower WM capacity in healthy elderly humans.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) act as a physical barrier separating the commensal-containing intestinal tract from the sterile interior. These cells have found a complex balance allowing them to be prepared for pathogen attacks while still tolerating the presence of bacteria/viral stimuli present in the lumen of the gut. Using primary human IECs, we probed the mechanisms, which allow for such a tolerance. We discovered that viral infection emanating from the basolateral side of IECs elicited a stronger intrinsic immune response as compared to lumenal apical infection. We determined that this asymmetric immune response was driven by the clathrin-sorting adapter AP-1B which mediates the polarized sorting of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) toward the basolateral side of IECs. Mice and human IECs lacking AP-1B showed an exacerbated immune response following apical stimulation. Together these results suggest a model where the cellular polarity program plays an integral role in the ability of IECs to partially tolerate apical commensals while remaining fully responsive against invasive basolateral pathogens.",

    "abstract": "1Evolutionary theory has produced two conflicting paradigms for the adaptation of a polygenic trait. While population genetics views adaptation as a sequence of selective sweeps at single loci underlying the trait, quantitative genetics posits a collective response, where phenotypic adaptation results from subtle allele frequency shifts at many loci. Yet, a synthesis of these views is largely missing and the population genetic factors that favor each scenario are not well understood. Here, we study the architecture of adaptation of a binary polygenic trait (such as resistance) with negative epistasis among the loci of its basis. The genetic structure of this trait allows for a full range of potential architectures of adaptation, ranging from sweeps to small frequency shifts. By combining computer simulations and a newly devised analytical framework based on Yule branching processes, we gain a detailed understanding of the adaptation dynamics for this trait. Our key analytical result is an expression for the joint distribution of mutant alleles at the end of the adaptive phase. This distribution characterizes the polygenic pattern of adaptation at the underlying genotype when phenotypic adaptation has been accomplished. We find that a single compound parameter, the population-scaled background mutation rate {Theta}bg, explains the main differences among these patterns. For a focal locus, {Theta}bg measures the mutation rate at all redundant loci in its genetic background that offer alternative ways for adaptation. For adaptation starting from mutation-selection-drift balance, we observe different patterns in three parameter regions. Adaptation proceeds by sweeps for small {Theta}bg [prsim] 0.1, while small polygenic allele frequency shifts require large {Theta}bg [scsim] 100. In the large intermediate regime, we observe a heterogeneous pattern of partial sweeps at several interacting loci.\n\n2 Author summaryIt is still an open question how complex traits adapt to new selection pressures. While population genetics champions the search for selective sweeps, quantitative genetics proclaims adaptation via small concerted frequency shifts. To date the empirical evidence of clear sweep signals is more scarce than expected, while subtle shifts remain notoriously hard to detect. In the current study we develop a theoretical framework to predict the expected adaptive architecture of a simple polygenic trait, depending on parameters such as mutation rate, effective population size, size of the trait basis, and the available genetic variability at the onset of selection. For a population in mutation-selection-drift balance we find that adaptation proceeds via complete or partial sweeps for a large set of parameter values. We predict adaptation by small frequency shifts for two main cases. First, for traits with a large mutational target size and high levels of genetic redundancy among loci, and second if the starting frequencies of mutant alleles are more homogeneous than expected in mutation-selection-drift equilibrium, e.g. due to population structure or balancing selection.",

    "abstract": "The use of alternative promoters for the cell type-specific expression of a given mRNA/protein is a common cell strategy. NEMO is a scaffold protein required for canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling. Transcription of the NEMO gene is primarily controlled by two promoters: one (promoter B) drives NEMO transcription in most cell types and the second (promoter A) is largely responsible for NEMO transcription in liver cells. Herein, we have used a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach to disrupt a core sequence element of promoter B, and this genetic editing essentially eliminates expression of NEMO mRNA and protein in 293T human kidney cells. By cell subcloning, we have isolated targeted 293T cell lines that express no detectable NEMO protein, have defined genomic alterations at promoter B, and do not support canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling in response to treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Nevertheless, non-canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling is intact in these NEMO-deficient cells. Expression of ectopic NEMO in the edited cells restores downstream NF-{kappa}B signaling in response to TNF. Targeting of the promoter B element does not substantially reduce NEMO expression (from promoter A) in the human SNU-423 liver cancer cell line. We have also used homology directed repair (HDR) to fix the promoter B element in a 293T cell clone. Overall, we have created a strategy for selectively eliminating cell type-specific expression from an alternative promoter and have generated 293T cell lines with a functional knockout of NEMO. The implications of these findings for further studies and for therapeutic approaches to target canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling are discussed.",

We addressed this question by using two-photon imaging of microvascular oxygen partial pressure (PO2) and flow in the whisker barrel cortex in awake mice at rest. Our measurements in layers I-V show that the capillary red-blood-cell flux and oxygenation heterogeneity, and the intracapillary resistance to oxygen delivery, all decrease with depth, reaching a minimum around layer IV, while the depth-dependent oxygen extraction fraction is increased in layer IV, where oxygen demand is presumably the highest. Our findings suggest that homogenization of physiological observables relevant to oxygen transport to tissue is an important part of the microvascular network adaptation to a local brain metabolism increase. These results will inform the biophysical models of layer-specific cerebral oxygen delivery and consumption and improve our understanding of diseases that affect the cerebral microcirculation.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTHomogenization of cortical capillary blood flow and oxygenation underpins an important mechanism, by which the microvascular network adapts to an increase in the local brain oxidative metabolism.",

While the striatum receives extensive excitatory afferents from the cerebral cortex, the influence of different cortical areas on striatal circuitry and behavior is unknown. Here we find that corticostriatal inputs from whisker-related primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex differentially innervate projection neurons and interneurons in the dorsal striatum, and exert opposing effects on sensory-guided behavior. Optogenetic stimulation of S1-corticostriatal afferents in ex vivo recordings produced larger postsynaptic potentials in striatal parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons than D1- or D2-expressing spiny projection neurons (SPNs), an effect not observed for M1-corticostriatal afferents. Critically, in vivo optogenetic stimulation of S1-corticostriatal afferents produced task-specific behavioral inhibition, which was bidirectionally modulated by striatal PV interneurons. Optogenetic stimulation of M1 afferents produced the opposite behavioral effect. Thus, our results suggest opposing roles for sensory and motor cortex in behavioral choice via distinct influences on striatal circuitry.",

    "abstract": "Ciliopathies manifested in part by a dysfunction of several phosphoinositide 5phosphatases constitute Lowes, Dent disease 2 and Joubert syndromes through critical involvement of properly functioning primary cilia (PC). We showed that deletion of INPP5E under the control of OMP-Cre in mature mouse olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) led to a dramatic redistribution of PI(4,5)P2 (PIP2) in cilia, significant reduction of PI(3,4)P2 and enrichment of PI(3,4,5)P3 in knobs. Redistribution of the phospholipids accompanied marked elongation of cilia in INPP5E-OMP knockout (KO) OSNs. Such a dramatic remodeling of phospholipid composition however did not affect other integral membrane lipids (cholesterol, sphingomyelin, glycosylated phosphaditylinositol, phosphatidylserine). Proteins known to bind with high affinity PIP2 entered the cilia of the KO OSNs. Loss of INPP5E did not affect ciliary localization of endogenous olfactory receptor M71/M72 or distribution and movement of IFT122 particles implicating independent of phospholipids mechanism of retrograde protein transport in cilia of mature OSNs. Net odor sensitivity and response magnitude as measured by EOG was not affected by the mutation. However, odor adaptation in the KO mouse was significantly impaired resulting in less efficient recovery and altered inactivation kinetics of the odor response at the EOG and single-cell level. These findings implicate phosphoinositide-dependent regulation of active Ca2+ extrusion in OSNs whereby controlling the rate of sensory adaptation.\\n\\nSignificance statementCurrently there are little if any available treatment to cure congenital ciliopathies. This is in part due to lack of basic knowledge of cilia biology. Olfactory cilia as well as primary cilia appear to be a phospholipid privileged organelle distinct from the rest of plasma membrane albeit sharing its continuity. We characterized distribution of several critically important for cell biology phospholipids and showed that their balance, especially of PIP2, is disrupted in Joubert syndrome animal model and has functional implications. Virally assisted delivery of wild type INPP5E to the mutant OSNs was able to restore localization of PIP2 and rescued impaired response to odor.",
