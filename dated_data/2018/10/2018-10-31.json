    "abstract": "The problem of bacterial resistance is becoming more and more serious, which has become an urgent problem to be solved in human and veterinary. One approach to control and delay bacterial resistance is combination therapy in which antibiotics are given together with other antimicrobial or non-antimicrobial agents. Studies have shown that flavonoids from Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) possess a high level of antibacterial activity against antibiotic resistant strains. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial effects of a combined therapy of total flavonoids from Ilex rotunda Thunb. and antibiotics against seven kinds of veterinary bacteria which were multidrug resistance bacteria. A microdilution checkerboard method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations of both types of antimicrobials, alone and in combination. The fractional inhibitory concentration index was calculated and used to classify observed collective antibacterial activity as synergistic, additive, indifferent or antagonistic.\\n\\nFrom the performed tests, the total flavonoids and antimicrobial agents were combined to inhibit different multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii. For these bacteria, total flavonoids from Ilex Rotunda Thunb. presented synergistic or additive with different antibiotics and had a certain antibacterial effect on the separated multidrug-resistant bacteria. The study shows total flavonoids from Ilex rotunda Thunb. have potential as adjuvants for the treatment of animal bacterial diseases.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionNumerous vancomycin population pharmacokinetic (PK) models of neonates have been published. We aimed to comparatively evaluate a set of these models by quantifying their model-based and Bayesian concentration prediction performances using an external retrospective dataset, and estimate their attainment rates in predefined therapeutic target ranges.\\n\\nMethodsImplementations of 12 published PK models were added in the Bayesian dose optimisation tool, DosOpt. Model based concentration predictions informed by variable number of individual concentrations were evaluated using multiple error metrics. A simulation study assessed the probabilities of target attainment (PTA) in trough concentration target ranges 10-15 mg/L and 10-20 mg/L.\\n\\nResultsNormalized prediction distribution error analysis revealed external validation dataset discordances (global P < 0.05) with all population PK models. Inclusion of a single concentration improved both precision and accuracy. The model by Marques-Minana et al. (2010) attained 68% of predictions within 30% of true concentrations. Absolute percentage errors of most models were within 20-30%. Mean PTA with Zhao et al. (2013) was 40.4% [coefficient-of-variation (CV) 0.5%] and 62.9% (CV 0.4%) within 10-15 mg/L and 10-20 mg/L, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionPredictive performances varied widely between models. Population based predictions were discordant with external validation dataset but Bayesian modelling with individual concentrations improved both precision and accuracy. Current vancomycin PK models achieve relatively low attainment of commonly recommended therapeutic target ranges.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEpigenomic studies that use next generation sequencing experiments typically rely on the alignment of reads to a reference sequence. However, because of genetic diversity and the diploid nature of the human genome, we hypothesized that using a generic reference could lead to incorrectly mapped reads and bias downstream results.\\n\\nResultsWe show that accounting for genetic variation using a modified reference genome (MPG) or a denovo assembled genome (DPG) can alter histone H3K4me1 and H3K27ac ChIP-seq peak calls by either creating new personal peaks or by the loss of reference peaks. MPGs are found to alter approximately 1% of peak calls while DPGs alter up to 5% of peaks. We also show statistically significant differences in the amount of reads observed in regions associated with the new, altered and unchanged peaks. We report that short insertions and deletions (indels), followed by single nucleotide variants (SNVs), have the highest probability of modifying peak calls. A counter-balancing factor is peak width, with wider calls being less likely to be altered. Next, because high-quality DPGs remain hard to obtain, we show that using a graph personalized genome (GPG), represents a reasonable compromise between MPGs and DPGs and alters about 2.5% of peak calls. Finally, we demonstrate that altered peaks have a genomic distribution typical of other peaks. For instance, for H3K4me1, 518 personal-only peaks were replicated using at least two of three approaches, 394 of which were inside or within 10Kb of a gene.\\n\\nConclusionsAnalysing epigenomic datasets with personalized and graph genomes allows the recovery of new peaks enriched for indels and SNVs. These altered peaks are more likely to differ between individuals and, as such, could be relevant in the study of various human phenotypes.",

First, an initial conformational ensemble is constructed using for example Molecular Dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations. Due to potential inaccuracies in the model and finite sampling effects, properties predicted from simulations may not agree with experimental data. In BME we use the experimental data to refine the simulation so that the new conformational ensemble has the following properties: (i) the calculated averages are close to the experimental values taking uncertainty into account and (ii) it maximizes the relative Shannon entropy with respect to the original simulation ensemble. The output of this procedure is a set of optimized weights that can be used to calculate arbitrary properties and distributions. Here, we provide a practical guide on how to obtain and use such weights, how to choose adjustable parameters and discuss shortcomings of the method.",

Here we report the versatile scaffold \\\"ArtiG\\\" to generate concentration-dependent RNA-protein condensates within living cells, as a bottom-up approach to study the impact of co-segregated endogenous components on phase separation. We demonstrate that intracellular RNA seeds the nucleation of the condensates, as it provides molecular cues to locally coordinate the formation of endogenous high order RNP assemblies.

    "abstract": "Bet-hedging--an evolutionary strategy that reduces fitness variance at the expense of lower mean fitness--is the primary explanation for most forms of biological adaptation to environmental unpredictability. However, most applications of bet-hedging theory to biological problems have largely made unrealistic demographic assumptions, such as non-overlapping generations and fixed population sizes. Consequently, the generality and applicability of bet-hedging theory to real world phenomena remains unclear. Here we use continuous-time, stochastic Lotka-Volterra models to relax overly restrictive demographic assumptions and explore a suite of biological adaptations to fluctuating environments. We discover a novel \\\"rising-tide strategy\\\" that--unlike the bet-hedging strategy--generates both a higher mean and variance in fitness. The positive fitness effects of the rising-tide strategys specialization to good years can overcome any negative effects of higher fitness variance in unpredictable environments. Moreover, we show not only that the rising-tide strategy will be selected for over a much broader range of environmental conditions than the bet-hedging strategy, but also under more realistic demographic circumstances. Ultimately, our model demonstrates that there are likely to be a wide range of ways that organisms respond to environmental unpredictability.",

    "abstract": "Practical biodiversity conservation relies on delineation of biologically meaningful units, particularly with respect to global conventions and regulatory frameworks. Traditional approaches have typically relied on morphological observation, resulting in artificially broad delineations and non-optimal species units for conservation. More recently, species delimitation methods have been revolutionised with High-Throughput Sequencing approaches, allowing study of diversity within species radiations using genome-wide data. The highly mobile elasmobranchs, manta and devil rays (Mobula spp.), are threatened globally by targeted and bycatch fishing pressures resulting in recent protection under several global conventions. However, a lack of global data, morphological similarities, a succession of recent taxonomic changes and ineffectual traceability measures combine to impede development and implementation of a coherent and enforceable conservation strategy. Here, we generate genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data from among the most globally and taxonomically representative set of mobulid tissues. The resulting phylogeny and delimitation of species units represents the most comprehensive assessment of mobulid diversity with molecular data to date. We find a mismatch between current species classifications, and optimal species units for effective conservation. Specifically, we find robust evidence for an undescribed species of manta ray in the Gulf of Mexico and show that species recently synonymised are reproductively isolated. Further resolution is achieved at the population level, where cryptic diversity is detected in geographically distinct populations, and indicates potential for future traceability work determining regional location of catch. We estimate the optimal species tree and uncover substantial incomplete lineage sorting, where standing variation in extinct ancestral populations is identified as a driver of phylogenetic uncertainty, with further conservation implications. Our study provides a framework for molecular genetic species delimitation that is relevant to wide-ranging taxa of conservation concern, and highlights the potential for genomic data to support effective management, conservation and law enforcement strategies.",

    "abstract": "There are many approaches available to inactivate bacteria, each with a different efficacy, impact on cell integrity, and potential for application in high-throughput. The aim of this study was to compare these approaches and develop a standardized protocol for generation of intact Gram-positive as well as on Gram-negative \\\"bacterial zombies\\\", i.e. cells that are metabolically dead with retained cellular integrity. Here, we introduce the term \\\"bacterial zombies\\\" in addition to \\\"bacterial ghosts\\\" to differentiate inactivated bacteria with preserved cellular integrity from those with perforated membranes, where DNA and cytoplasmic contents have been released. This differentiation of inactivated bacteria is important if the cell content is the subject of study, or if cell contents in the media may cause unwanted effects in downstream applications. We inactivated eight different bacterial species by treatment with beta-propiolactone, ethanol, formalin, sodium hydroxide, and pasteurization. Inactivation efficacy was determined by culturing, and cell wall integrity assessed by quantifying released DNA and visualization by scanning electron microscopy. Based on these results, we discuss the choice of bacterial inactivation methods, and conclude that beta-propiolactone and ethanol are the most promising approaches for standardized generation of bacterial zombies.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEFor applications such as vaccination or analyses that are sensitive to bacterial growth, inactivated bacteria are preferred because they simplify the analyses and the interpretation of results. This study compared various bacterial inactivation treatments that maintain cell integrity and may be used in high-throughput. Our results demonstrated that beta-propiolactone and 70% ethanol were the best techniques to achieve these goals.",

    "abstract": "The testing-effect, or retrieval-mediated learning, is one of the most robust effects in memory research. It shows that actively and repeatedly retrieving information, compared to merely restudying it, improves long-term retention. Surprisingly, little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Attempting to fill this gap, a recent framework proposed that retrieval acts as a fast memory consolidation mechanism, stabilizing memories through online reactivation, similar to memory replay during offline (e.g. sleep) consolidation. In this fMRI study, we empirically tested the predictions derived from this framework.\\n\\nWe predicted that reactivation during retrieval allows memories to become embedded in neocortex, creating an additional route to access the memory trace and rendering it less hippocampus-dependent. Participants encoded scene-object pairs and either retrieved or restudied the objects over two sessions, two days apart. We analysed univariate and multivariate changes in brain activity specific to retrieval but not restudy, and tested whether the predicted changes occur rapidly within a session, or evolve slowly, across the two days.\\n\\nResults showed that medial prefrontal cortex activation increased across retrieval trials within one session, consistent with a fast consolidation account. Hippocampal activity decreased across sessions, suggesting a slower mechanism. Moreover, Representational Similarity Analyses (RSA) showed that consecutive retrieval attempts strengthen both higher-level semantic and episode-specific information in parietal areas, both across but not within sessions. Our findings suggest that retrieval supports the online creation of a neocortical trace, which becomes increasingly relevant at long delays when hippocampus-dependent episodic details would otherwise have faded.\\n\\nSignificance statementRepeated remembering strengthens memories much more so than repeated learning. The aim of this study was to shed light onto the poorly understood neurocognitive underpinnings of retrieval-mediated learning. We tested a novel framework proposing that a memorys stabilization via retrieval relies on mechanisms akin to those involved in offline systems consolidation. Observing the retrieval-induced neural pattern changes across different timescales, we find that retrieval stabilizes semantic and episodic aspects of the original memories, and produces increases in prefrontal activity and decreases in hippocampal activity that are consistent with the consolidation view, but not necessarily with a fast acting mechanism. Our findings inform cognitive theories of the testing effect, suggesting that retrieval produces its benefits by interacting with hippocampal-neocortical consolidation mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Genomic conflicts may play a central role in the evolution of reproductive barriers. Theory predicts that early-onset hybrid inviability may stem from conflict between parents for resource allocation to offspring. Here we describe M. decorus; a group of cryptic species within the M. guttatus species complex that are largely reproductively isolated by hybrid seed inviability (HSI). HSI between M. guttatus and M. decorus is common and strong, but populations of M. decorus vary in the magnitude and directionality of HSI with M. guttatus. Patterns of HSI between M. guttatus and M. decorus, as well as within M. decorus conform to the predictions of parental conflict: (1) reciprocal F1s exhibit size differences and parent-of-origin specific endosperm defects, (2) the extent of asymmetry between reciprocal F1 seed size is correlated with asymmetry in HSI, and (3) inferred differences in the extent of conflict predict the extent of HSI between populations. We also find that HSI is rapidly evolving, as populations that exhibit the most HSI are each others closest relative. Lastly, while all populations are largely outcrossing, we find that the differences in the inferred strength of conflict scale positively with {pi}, suggesting that demographic or life history factors other than mating system may also influence the rate of parental conflict driven evolution. Overall, these patterns suggest the rapid evolution of parent-of-origin specific resource allocation alleles coincident with HSI within and between M. guttatus and M. decorus. Parental conflict may therefore be an important evolutionary driver of reproductive isolation.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a significant human pathogen whose evolution and adaptation has been shaped in part by mobile genetic elements (MGEs), facilitating global spread of extensive antimicrobial resistance. However, our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics surrounding MGEs is incomplete, in particular how changes in the structure of multidrug-resistant (MDR) plasmids may influence important staphylococcal phenotypes. Here, we undertook a population-and functional-genomics study of 212 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ST239 isolates collected over 32 years to explore the evolution of the pSK1 family of MDR plasmids, illustrating how these plasmids have co-evolved with and contributed to the successful adaptation of this persistent MRSA lineage. Using complete genomes and temporal phylogenomics we reconstructed the evolution of the pSK1 family lineage from its emergence in the late 1970s, with multiple structural variants arising. Plasmid maintenance and stability was linked to IS256- and IS257-mediated chromosomal integration and disruption of plasmid replication machinery. Overlaying genomic comparisons with phenotypic susceptibility data for gentamicin and chlorhexidine, it appeared that pSK1 has contributed to enhanced resistance in ST239 MRSA through two mechanisms: (i) acquisition of plasmid-borne resistance mechanisms increasing rates of gentamicin resistance and reduced chlorhexidine susceptibility, and (ii) changes in plasmid configuration linked with further enhancement of chlorhexidine tolerance. While the exact mechanism of enhanced tolerance remains elusive, this research has uncovered a clear evolutionary response of ST239 MRSA to chlorhexidine, one which may contribute to the ongoing persistence and adaptation of this lineage within healthcare institutions.",

    "abstract": "In mammals and in invertebrates the proliferation of a newly invading transposable element (TE) is thought to be stopped by a random insertion of one member of the invading TE family into a piRNA cluster. This view is known as the trap model. Here we explore the dynamics of TE invasions under the trap model using large-scale computer simulations. We found that piRNA clusters confer a substantial benefit, effectively preventing extinction of host populations from an uncontrollable proliferation of deleterious TEs. We show that TE invasions under the trap model consists of three distinct phases: first the TE rapidly amplifies within the population, next TE proliferation is stopped by segregating cluster insertions and finally the TE is permanently inactivated by fixation of a cluster insertion. Suppression by segregating cluster insertions is unstable and bursts of TE activity may yet occur. The transpositon rate and the population size mostly influence the length of the phases but not the amount of TEs accumulating during an invasion. Solely the size of piRNA clusters was identified as a major factor influencing TE abundance. Investigating the impact of different cluster architectures we found that a single non-recombining cluster (e.g. the somatic cluster flamenco in Drosophila) is more efficient in stopping invasions than clusters distributed over several chromosomes (e.g germline cluster in Drosophila). With the somatic architecture fewer TEs accumulate during an invasion and fewer cluster insertions are required to stop the TE. The inefficiency of the germline architecture stems from recombination among cluster sites which makes it necessary that each diploid carries, on the average, four cluster insertions, such that most individuals will end up with at least one cluster insertion. Surprisingly we found that negative selection in a model with piRNA clusters can lead to a novel equilibrium state, where TE copy numbers remain stable despite only some individuals in a population carrying a cluster insertion. Finally when applying our approach to real data from Drosophila melanogaster we found that the trap model reasonably well accounts for the abundance of germline TEs but not of somatic TEs. The abundance of somatic TEs, such as gypsy, is much lower than expected.",

    "abstract": "A longstanding challenge for computational neuroscience has been the development of biologically plausible learning rules for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) enabling the production and processing of time-dependent signals such as those that might drive movement or facilitate working memory. Classic gradient-based algorithms for training RNNs have been available for decades, but they are inconsistent with known biological features of the brain, such as causality and locality. In this work we derive an approximation to gradient-based learning that comports with these biologically motivated constraints. Specifically, the online learning rule for the synaptic weights involves only local information about the pre- and postsynaptic activities, in addition to a random feedback projection of the RNN output error. In addition to providing mathematical arguments for the effectiveness of the new learning rule, we show through simulations that it can be used to train an RNN to successfully perform a variety of tasks. Finally, to overcome the difficulty of training an RNN over a very large number of timesteps, we propose an augmented circuit architecture that allows the RNN to concatenate short-duration patterns into sequences of longer duration.",

Using biophysical techniques including isothermal titration calorimetry and X-ray crystallography, we verify that pirin binds these compounds in vitro.

Finally, using both siRNA and a previously validated pirin inhibitor, we show a role for pirin in TGF-p induced gene expression in primary dermal fibroblasts.

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a highly prevalent condition associated with considerable metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurocognitive morbidity. Childhood OSAS is underdiagnosed due to a limited number of sleep laboratories and the lack of a screening test, and the subtlety of daytime symptoms in children compared to adults. A potential marker of OSAS is apnea-induced sympathoexcitation, which is likely to be exacerbated during rapid-eyemovement (REM) sleep. However, traditional methods of assessing sympathetic activity are either too invasive or insensitive/nonspecific for clinical use, particularly as a screening test. Study population comprised pediatric patients with OSAS (16 moderate/severe, 18 mild) and 18 normal non-snoring controls. We show that the chaotic dynamics of heart rate variability (HRV) as assessed by a sensitive noise titration assay is significantly increased during REM compared to non-REM sleep in children, particularly those with OSAS. The increase in heart rate chaos prevails in the face of decreased parasympathetic-mediated high-frequency component of the HRV power spectrum, indicating that the chaos was correlated to sympathetic instead of parasympathetic activity. Receiver operating characteristic analysis shows that such non-high frequency chaos reveals changing sympathetic-parasympathetic activities that are not discernible by conventional HRV metrics such as low- to high-frequency power ratio or sample entropy, with sensitivity and specificity sufficient to detect even mild OSAS in children. Results suggest a possible role for non-high frequency heart rate chaos as a selective noninvasive marker of sympathoexcitation in REM sleep, OSAS and potentially other cardiovascular abnormalities such as congestive heart failure.",

    "abstract": "Low-frequency vibrational excitations of protein macromolecules in the terahertz frequency region are suggested to contribute to many biological processes such as enzymatic catalysis, intra-protein energy/charge transport, recognition, and allostery. To explain high effectiveness of these processes, two possible mechanisms of the long-lived excitation were proposed by H. Frohlich and A.S. Davydov which relate to either vibrational modes or solitary waves, respectively. In this paper, we developed a quantum dynamic model of vibrational excitation in -helical proteins interacting with the aqueous environment. In the model, we distinguished three coupled subsystems, i.e. (i) a chain of hydrogen-bonded peptide groups (PGs), interacting with (ii) the subsystem of the side-chain residuals which in turn interacts with (iii) the environment, surrounding water responsible for dissipation and fluctuation in the system. It was shown that the equation of motion for phonon variables of the PG chain can be transformed to nonlinear Schrodinger equation which admits bifurcation into the solution corresponding to the weak damped vibrational modes (Frohlich-type regime) and Davydov solitons. A bifurcation parameter is derived through the strength of phonon-phonon interaction between the side-chains and hydration-shell water molecules. As shown, the energy of these excited states is pumped through the interaction of the side-chains with fluctuating water environment of the proteins. The suggested mechanism of the collective vibrational mode excitation is discussed in connection with the recent experiments on the long-lived collective protein excitations in the terahertz frequency region and vibrational energy transport pathways in proteins.",

    "abstract": "There are many situations in nature where we expect traits to evolve but not necessarily for mean fitness to increase. However, these scenarios are hard to reconcile simultaneously with Fishers Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection and the Price identity. The consideration of indirect genetic effects on fitness reconciles these fundamental theorems with the observation that traits sometimes evolve without any adaptation, by explicitly considering the correlated evolution of the social environment, which is a form of transmission bias. While transmission bias in the Price identity is often assumed to be absent, here we show that explicitly considering indirect genetic effects as a form of transmission bias for fitness has several benefits: 1) it makes clear how traits can evolve while mean fitness remains stationary, 2) it reconciles the fundamental theorem of natural selection with the evolution of maladaptation, 3) it explicitly includes density-dependent fitness through negative social effects that depend on the number of interacting conspecifics, and 4) its allows mean fitness to evolve even when direct genetic variance in fitness is zero, if related individuals interact and/or if there is multilevel selection. In summary, considering fitness in the context of indirect genetic effects aligns important theorems of natural selection with many situations observed in nature and provides a useful lens through which we might better understand evolution and adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Alcaligenesfaecalis strain JQ135 utilizes picolinic acid (PA) as sole carbon and nitrogen source for growth. In this study, we screened a 6-hydroxypicolinic acid (6HPA) degradation-deficient mutant through random transposon mutagenesis. The mutant hydroxylated 6HPA into an intermediate, identified as 3,6-dihydroxypicolinic acid (3,6DHPA) with no further degradation. A novel decarboxylase PicC was identified that was found to be responsible for the decarboxylation of 3,6DHPA to 2.5-dihydroxypyridine. Although, PicC belonged to amidohydrolase_2 family, it shows low similarity (<45%) when compared to other reported amidohydrolase_2 family decarboxylases. Moreover, PicC was found to form a monophyletic group in the phylogenetic tree constructed using PicC and related proteins. Further, the genetic deletion and complementation results demonstrated that picC was essential for PA degradation. The PicC was Zn2+-dependent non-oxidative decarboxylase that can specifically catalyze the irreversible decarboxylation of 3,6DHPA to 2.5-dihydroxypyridine. The Km and kcat towards 3,6DHPA were observed to be 13.44 M and 4.77 s-1, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that His163 and His216 were essential for PicC activity.\\n\\nImportancePicolinic acid is a natural toxic pyridine derived from L-tryptophan metabolism and some aromatic compounds in mammalian and microbial cells. Microorganisms can degrade and utilize picolinic acid for their growth, and thus, a microbial degradation pathway of picolinic acid has been proposed. Picolinic acid is converted into 6-hydroxypicolinic acid, 3,6-dihydroxypicolinic acid, and 2,5-dihydroxypyridine in turn. However, there was no physiological and genetic validation for this pathway. This study demonstrated that 3,6DHPA was an intermediate in PA catabolism process and further identified and characterized a novel amidohydrolase_2 family decarboxylase PicC. It was also shown that PicC could catalyze the decarboxylation process of 3,6-dihydroxypicolinic acid into 2,5-dihydroxypyridine. This study provides a basis for understanding PA degradation pathway and the underlying molecular mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Recent fMRI research shows that perceptual and cognitive representations are instantiated in high-dimensional multi-voxel patterns in the brain. However, the methods for detecting these representations are limited. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a new approach, based on the mathematical field of topology, that can detect unique types of geometric features in patterns of data. Several recent studies have successfully applied TDA to study various forms of neural data; however, to our knowledge, TDA has not been successfully applied to data from event-related fMRI designs. Event-related fMRI is very common but limited in terms of the number of events that can be run within a practical time frame and the effect size that can be expected. Here, we investigate whether persistent homology -- a popular TDA tool that identifies topological features in data and quantifies their robustness -- can identify known signals given these constraints. We use fmrisim, a Python-based simulator of realistic fMRI data, to assess the plausibility of recovering a simple topological representation under a variety of conditions. Our results suggest that persistent homology can be used under certain circumstances to recover topological structure embedded in realistic fMRI data simulations.",

    "abstract": "Delamanid represents one of two novel antimicrobial classes approved to treat tuberculosis in over 40 years. Pretomanid is another promising nitroimidazole pro-drug in clinical development. Characterization of the full spectrum of mutations conferring resistance to nitroimidazoles and their related phenotypes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis will inform development of suitable genotypic and phenotypic drug susceptibility tests. Here, we used a range of pretomanid doses to select pretomanid-resistant mutants in two pathologically distinct murine TB models. The frequency of spontaneous pretomanid resistance mutations was approximately 10-5 CFU. Pretomanid demonstrated dose-dependent bactericidal activity and selective amplification of resistant mutants. Whole genome sequencing of 161 resistant isolates from 47 mice revealed 99 unique mutations, 90% of which were found in 1 of 5 genes previously associated with nitroimidazole activation and resistance. The remaining 10% harbored isolated mutations in Rv2983. Complementing an Rv2983 mutant with a wild-type copy of Rv2983 restored wild-type susceptibility to pretomanid and delamanid, confirming that loss of Rv2983 function causes nitroimidazole resistance. By quantifying F420 and its precursor Fo in Mycobacterium smegmatis overexpressing Rv2983 and an M. tuberculosis Rv2983 mutant, we provide evidence that Rv2983 is necessary for F420 biosynthesis and nitroimidazole activation, perhaps as the guanylyltransferase CofC. F420H2-deficient mutants displayed hypersusceptibility to malachite green (MG), a selective decontaminant present in solid media used to isolate and propagate mycobacteria from clinical samples. The wide diversity of mutations causing high-level pretomanid resistance and MG hypersusceptibility of most mutants poses significant challenges to clinical detection of nitroimidazole resistance using either genotypic or phenotypic methods.\\n\\nSignificanceNitroimidazole pro-drugs represent a promising new class of anti-tuberculosis drugs. Reliable methods to assure nitroimidazole susceptibility are critical to assure their optimal use. Yet, the spectrum of nitroimidazole resistance mutations remains incompletely characterized. Using 161 pretomanid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates selected in pretomanid-treated mice, we discovered a novel resistance determinant, Rv2983, required for cofactor F420 biosynthesis and characterized the remarkable diversity of mutations in this and 5 other genes involved in nitroimidazole activation. We show that F420H2-deficient nitroimidazole-resistant mutants are hypersusceptible to the selective decontaminant malachite green used in solid media to isolate mycobacteria and may evade detection on such media. These results have important implications for development and clinical use of genotypic and phenotypic methods for nitroimidazole susceptibility testing.",

This sparseness could reflect weak feedforward sensory inputs that are not sufficient to generate action potentials in these layers. Alternatively, sparseness might reflect tuning to unknown or higher-level complex features that are not fully explored in the stimulus space. Here, we examined these hypotheses by applying a range of vibrotactile and manual vibrissal stimuli in awake, head-fixed mice while performing loose-seal cell-attached recordings from the vibrissal primary somatosensory (vS1) cortex. A high-velocity stimulus delivered by a piezo-electric actuator evoked activity in a small fraction of regular spiking supragranular neurons (29%) in awake condition. However, a majority of the supragranular regular spiking neurons (84%) were driven by manual stimulation of whiskers. Our results suggest that most neurons in the superficial layers of vS1 cortex contribute to coding in awake conditions when neurons may encounter their preferred feature(s) during whisker-object interactions.",

The existence and regularity of a, so called, proportional recovery rule across a range of functional deficits and therapies supports the notion that functional interventions have little or no impact beyond spontaneous recovery rates in a  critical window of recovery which lasts from 3 to 6 months post-stroke. In this meta-analysis, we apply a bootstrap analysis method to assess the overall impact of a specific VR-based rehabilitation protocol for the upper extremities on a homogeneous sample of 219 individuals with hemiparesis at various stages post stroke. Our analysis uncovers a precise gradient of sensitivity to treatment that expands more than one year beyond the limits of the so-called  critical window of recovery.

    "abstract": "Symbiotic microorganisms are widespread in nature and can play a major role in the ecology and evolution of animals. The aphid-Serratia symbiotica bacterium interaction provides a valuable model to study mechanisms behind these symbiotic associations. The recent discovery of cultivable S. symbiotica strains having the possibility of free-living lifestyle allowed us to simulate their environmental acquisition by aphids to examine the mechanisms involved in this infection pathway. Here, after oral ingestion, we analyzed the infection dynamic of cultivable S. symbiotica strains during the hosts lifetime using qPCR and fluorescence techniques and determined the immediate fitness consequences of these bacteria on their new host. We further examined the transmission behavior and phylogenetic position of cultivable strains. Usually, S. symbiotica are considered as maternally-transmitted bacteria living within aphid body cavity and bringing some benefits to their hosts despite their costs. Otherwise, our study revealed that cultivable S. symbiotica are predisposed to establish a symbiotic association with new aphid host, settling in its gut. We showed that cultivable S. symbiotica colonized the entire aphid digestive tract following infection, after which the bacterium multiplied exponentially during aphid development. Our results further revealed that gut colonization by the bacteria induce a fitness cost to their hosts. Nevertheless, it appeared that they also offer an immediate protection against parasitoids. Interestingly, cultivable S. symbiotica seem to be extracellularly transmitted, possibly through the honeydew. These findings provide new insights into the nature of symbiosis in aphids and the mechanisms underpinning these interactions.\\n\\nImportanceFor the first time, our study provides experimental data that highlight a new kind of symbiotic associations in aphids. By successfully isolating microbial symbiont from aphids and by cultivating it in vitro in our laboratory, we established artificial association by simulating new bacterial acquisitions involved in aphid gut infection. Our results showed the early stages involved in this route of infection. Until now, Serratia symbiotica is considered as a maternally-transmitted aphid endosymbiont. Nevertheless, here, we showed that our cultivable strains having an intermediate status between a strict free-living bacterium and a facultative endosymbiont, occupy and replicate in aphid gut and seem to be transmitted over generations through an environmental transmission mechanism. Moreover, they are both parasites and mutualists given the context, as many of the endosymbionts in aphids. Our findings give new perception of associations involved in aphids symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "Lysine acetylation is thought to provide a mechanism for regulating metabolism in diverse bacteria. Indeed, many studies have shown that the majority of enzymes involved in central metabolism are acetylated and that acetylation can alter enzyme activity. However, the details regarding this regulatory mechanism are still unclear, specifically with regards to the signals that induce lysine acetylation. To better understand this global regulatory mechanism, we profiled changes in lysine acetylation during growth of Escherichia coli on the hexose glucose or the pentose xylose at both high and low sugar concentrations using label-free mass spectrometry. The goal was to see whether lysine acetylation differed during growth on these two different sugars. No significant differences, however, were observed. Rather, the initial sugar concentration was the principal factor governing changes in lysine acetylation, with higher sugar concentrations causing more acetylation. These results suggest that acetylation does not target specific metabolic pathways but rather simply targets accessible lysines, which may or may not alter enzyme activity. They further suggest that lysine acetylation principally results from conditions that favor accumulation of acetyl phosphate, the principal acetate donor in E. coli.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBacteria alter their metabolism in response to nutrient availability, growth conditions, and environmental stresses. This process is best understood at the level of transcriptional regulation, where many metabolic genes are conditionally expressed in response to diverse cues. However, additional modes of regulations are known to exist. One is lysine acetylation, a post-translational modification known to target many metabolic enzymes. However, unlike transcriptional regulation, little is known about this regulatory mode. We investigated the factors inducing changes in lysine acetylation by comparing growth on glucose and xylose. We found that the specific sugar used for growth did not alter the pattern of acetylation; rather, the principal factor was the amount of sugar, with more sugar yielding more acetylation. These results imply lysine acetylation is a global regulatory mechanism that is not responsive to the specific carbon source per se but rather the accumulation of downstream metabolites.",

    "abstract": "The perception of sensory events can be suppressed or enhanced by the surrounding spatial and temporal context in ways that help in detecting novel objects and establishing perceptual constancy. In the auditory system, the phenomenon known as auditory enhancement reflects a general principle of contrast enhancement, where a target sound embedded within a background sound becomes perceptually more salient if the background is presented first by itself. This effect is highly robust, producing an effective enhancement of the target of between 5 and 25 dB (more than two orders of magnitude in intensity), depending on the task. Despite their ubiquity in vision, neural correlates of auditory contrast enhancement have yet to be identified in humans. Here we used the auditory steady-state response to probe the neural response to a target sound under conditions of enhancement. The probe was simultaneously modulated in amplitude with two modulation frequencies, to distinguish cortical from subcortical contributions to this phenomenon. We found robust auditory cortical, but not subcortical, enhancement that correlates with behavior and is consistent with an early theoretical model that postulates neural adaptation of inhibition. Our findings provide empirical support for a previously unverified theory of auditory enhancement and point to new approaches for improving sensory prostheses for hearing loss, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants.\n\nSignificance StatementA target sound embedded within a background sound becomes perceptually more salient if the background is presented first by itself. This phenomenon, where the target \"pops out\", is known as auditory enhancement. It reflects a general principle of contrast enhancement, and helps in the detection of new acoustic events in the environment and in establishing the perceptual constancy of speech and other biologically relevant sounds under varying acoustic conditions. We use EEG in humans to reveal a cortical correlate of this perceptual phenomenon that provides empirical support for a longstanding but previously unverified theoretical account.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) imaging is a popular technique for increasing acquisition speed in echo-planar imaging (EPI) fMRI. However, SMS data are prone to motion sensitivity and slice leakage artefacts, which spread signal between simultaneously acquired slices. Relevant to motion sensitivity, artefacts from moving anatomic structures propagate along the phase-encoding (PE) direction. This is particularly relevant for eye movement. As signal from the eye is acquired along with signal from simultaneously excited slices during SMS, there is potential for signal to spread in-plane and between spatially remote slices. After identifying an artefact temporally coinciding with signal fluctuations in the eye and spatially distributed in correspondence with multiband slice acceleration and parallel imaging factors, we conducted a series of small experiments to investigate eye movement artefacts in SMS data and the contribution of PE direction to the invasiveness of these artefacts. Five healthy adult volunteers were scanned during a blinking task using a standard SMS-EPI protocol with posterior-to-anterior (P>>A), anterior-to-posterior (A>>P) or right-to-left (R>>L) PE direction. The intensity of signal fluctuations (artefact severity) was measured at expected artefact positions and control positions. We demonstrated a direct relationship between eye movements and artefact severity across expected artefact regions. Within-brain artefacts were apparent in P>>A- and A>>P-acquired data but not in R>>L data due to the shift in artefact positions. Further research into eye motion artefacts in SMS data is warranted but researchers should exercise caution with SMS protocols. We recommend rigorous piloting of SMS protocols and switching to R>>L/L>>R PE where feasible.",
