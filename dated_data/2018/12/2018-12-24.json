    "abstract": "Decision bias is traditionally conceptualized as an internal reference against which sensory evidence is compared. Instead, we show that individuals implement decision bias by shifting the rate of sensory evidence accumulation towards a decision bound. Participants performed a target detection task while we recorded EEG. We experimentally manipulated participants decision criterion for reporting targets using different stimulus-response reward contingencies, inducing either a liberal or a conservative bias. Drift diffusion modeling revealed that a liberal strategy biased sensory evidence accumulation towards target-present choices. Moreover, a liberal bias resulted in stronger midfrontal pre-stimulus 2-6 Hz (theta) power and suppression of pre-stimulus 8--12 Hz (alpha) power in posterior cortex. The alpha suppression in turn mediated the output activity of visual cortex, as expressed in 59--100 Hz (gamma) power. These findings show that observers can intentionally control cortical excitability to strategically bias evidence accumulation towards the decision bound that maximizes their reward.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms that regulate fusion of monocytes into functional osteoclasts are virtually unknown. We describe a knock-in mouse model for the R51Q mutation in sorting nexin 10 (SNX10) that exhibits osteopetrosis and related symptoms of patients of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis linked to this mutation. Osteopetrosis arises in homozygous R51Q SNX10 mice due to a unique combination of reduced numbers of osteoclasts that are non-functional. Fusion of mutant monocytes is deregulated and occurs rapidly and continuously to form giant, non-functional osteoclasts. Mutant osteoclasts mature quickly and survive poorly in vitro, possibly accounting for their scarcity in vivo. These cells also exhibit impaired ruffled borders, which are required for bone resorption, providing an additional basis for the osteopetrotic phenotype. More broadly, we propose that the maximal size of osteoclasts is actively determined by a genetically-regulated, cell-autonomous mechanism that limits precursor cell fusion, and for which SNX10 is required.",

    "abstract": "Conjugative plasmids from the IncHI incompatibility group are relevant vectors for multidrug resistance. In this study, a comparison of the similarities and differences in the 44 publicly available sequences of IncHI plasmids from Enterobacteriaceae (1961-2013), revealed extensive conservation of their coding sequences. However, each genome had accessory regions with features of degradation or resistance to antibacterial agents. This article elucidates the IncHI1, IncHI2 and IncHI3 subgroup plasmids from the evolutive line based on multiple drug-resistant modules, explains the origin of the IncHI1 pAKU1-like composite transposon lineage, typifies the subgroup IncHI3, which is distantly related to IncHI1 and IncHI2 in phylogenetic analyses, confirms the relations within the transfer regions of H-group plasmids, and points to the divergence time of evolution with phylogenetic trees. Homology between subgroups, as measured by the molecular clock test, indicated that the contemporary IncHI1 and IncHI2 transfer region lineages diverged from an ancestral clone approximately 8,000 years ago (17,000 years ago if the divergent IncHI3 plasmids are included), although the IncH backbone was older. The uniformity of the composite transposon shared by most IncHI1 subgroup plasmids might be functionally equivalent to the heavy metal resistance that is mediated by some operons in the IncHI2 subgroup plasmids. A comparison of the DNA among these closely related plasmids provided insights on the horizontal and vertical transfers that were involved in their development.",

    "abstract": "Studies of spliceosomal interactions are challenging due to their dynamic nature. Here we employed spliceosome iCLIP, which immunoprecipitates SmB along with snRNPs and auxiliary RNA binding proteins (RBPs), to map human spliceosome engagement with snRNAs and pre-mRNAs. This identified over 50,000 branchpoints (BPs) that have canonical sequence and structural features. Moreover, it revealed 7 binding peaks around BPs and splice sites, each precisely overlapping with binding profiles of specific splicing factors. We show how the binding patterns of these RBPs are affected by the position and strength of BPs. For example, strong or proximally located BPs preferentially bind SF3 rather than U2AF complex. Notably, these effects are partly neutralized during spliceosomal assembly in a way that depends on the core spliceosomal protein PRPF8. These insights exemplify spliceosome iCLIP as a broadly applicable method for transcriptomic studies of splicing mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe chemically-rich seaweed Galaxaura is not only highly competitive with corals, but also provides substrate for other macroalgae. Its ecology and associated epiphytes remain largely unexplored. To fill this knowledge gap, we herein undertook an ecological assessment to explore the spatial variation, temporal dynamics, and epiphytic macroalgae of G. divaricata on patch reefs in the lagoon of Dongsha Atoll, a shallow coral reef ecosystem in the northern South China Sea, repeatedly impacted by mass coral bleaching events.\\n\\nMethodsTwelve spatially independent patch reefs in the Dongsha lagoon were first surveyed to assess the benthic composition in April 2016, and then revisited to determine G. divaricata percent cover in September 2017, with one additional Galaxaura-dominated reef (site 9). Four surveys over a period of 17 months were carried out on a degraded patch reef (site 7) to assess the temporal variation in G. divaricata cover. Epiphytic macroalgae associated with G. divaricata were quantified and identified through the aid of DNA barcoding.\\n\\nResultsPatch reefs in the Dongsha lagoon were degraded, exhibiting relatively low live coral cover (5-43%), but high proportions of macroalgae (13-58%) and other substrates (rubble and dead corals; 23-69%). The distribution of G. divaricata was heterogeneous across the lagoon, with highest abundance (16-41%) in the southeast area. Temporal surveys from site 7 and photo-evidence from site 9 suggested that an overgrowth by G. divaricata was still present to a similar extend after 17 months and 3.5 years. Yet, G. divaricata provides a suitable substrate some allelopathic macroalgae (e.g., Lobophora sp.).\\n\\nConclusionsOur study demonstrates that an allelopathic seaweed, such as G. divaricata, can overgrow degraded coral reefs for extended periods of time. By providing habitat for harmful macroalgae, a prolonged Galaxaura overgrowth could strengthen negative feedback loops on degraded coral reefs, further decreasing their recovery potential.",

    "abstract": "Targeting protein kinases is an important strategy for intervention in cancer. Inhibitors are directed at the active conformation or a variety of inactive conformations. While attempts have been made to classify these conformations, a structurally rigorous catalogue of states has not been achieved. The kinase activation loop is crucial for catalysis and begins with the conserved DFGmotif (Asp-Phe-Gly). This motif is observed in two major classes of conformations, DFGin - a set of active and inactive conformations where the Phe residue is in contact with the C-helix of the N-terminal lobe, and DFGout - an inactive form where Phe occupies the ATP site exposing the C-helix pocket. We have developed a clustering of kinase conformations based on the location of the Phe side chain (DFGin, DFGout, and DFGinter or intermediate) and the backbone dihedral angles of the sequence X-D-F, where X is the residue before the DFGmotif, and the DFG-Phe side-chain rotamer, utilizing a density-based clustering algorithm. We have identified 8 distinct conformations and labeled them based on their Ramachandran regions (A=alpha, B=beta, L=left) and the Phe rotamer (minus, plus, trans). Our clustering divides the DFGin group into six clusters including  BLAminus, which contains active structures, and two common inactive forms,  BLBplus and  ABAminus. DFGout structures are predominantly in the  BBAminus conformation, which is essentially required for binding Type II inhibitors. The inactive conformations have specific features that make them unable to bind ATP, magnesium ion, and/or substrates. Our structurally intuitive nomenclature will aid in understanding the conformational dynamics of these proteins and structure-based development of kinase drugs.\\n\\nSignificance statementProtein kinases play important roles in signaling pathways and are widely studied as drug targets. Their active site exhibits remarkable structural variation as observed in the large number of available crystal structures. We have developed a clustering scheme and nomenclature to categorize and label all the observed conformations in human protein kinases. This has enabled us to clearly define the geometry of the active state and to distinguish closely related inactive states which were previously not characterized. Our classification of kinase conformations will help in better understanding the conformational dynamics of these proteins and the development of inhibitors against them.",

Sighted humans concurrently encode tactile location in skin-based and, after integration with posture, external spatial reference frames, whereas congenitally blind humans preferably use skin-based coding. Accordingly, lateralization of alpha-band activity in parietal regions during attentional orienting in expectance of tactile stimulation reflected external spatial coding in sighted, but skin-based coding in blind humans. Here, we asked whether alpha-band activity plays a similar role in spatial coding for tactile processing, that is, after the stimulus has been received. Sighted and congenitally blind participants were cued to attend to one hand in order to detect rare tactile deviant stimuli at this hand while ignoring tactile deviants at the other hand and tactile standard stimuli at both hands. The reference frames encoded by oscillatory activity during tactile processing were probed by adopting either an uncrossed or crossed hand posture. In sighted participants, attended relative to unattended standard stimuli suppressed the power in the alpha-band over ipsilateral centro-parietal and occipital cortex. Hand crossing attenuated this attentional modulation predominantly over ipsilateral posterior-parietal cortex. In contrast, although contralateral alpha-activity was enhanced for attended versus unattended stimuli in blind participants, no crossing effects were evident in the oscillatory activity of this group. These findings suggest that oscillatory alpha-band activity plays a pivotal role in the neural coding of external spatial information for touch.",

    "abstract": "Forest models often reflect the dominant management paradigm of their time. Until the late 1970s, this meant sustaining yields. Following landmark work in forest ecology, physiology, and biogeochemistry, the current generation of models is further intended to inform ecological and climatic forest management in alignment with national biodiversity and climate mitigation targets. This has greatly increased the complexity of models used to inform management, making them difficult to diagnose and understand. State-of-the-art forest models are often complex, analytically intractable, and computationally-expensive, due to the explicit representation of detailed biogeochemical and ecological processes. Different models often produce distinct results while predictions from the same model vary with parameter values. In this project, we developed a rigorous quantitative approach for conducting model intercomparisons and assessing model performance. We have applied our original methodology to compare two forest biogeochemistry models, the Perfect Plasticity Approximation with Simple Biogeochemistry (PPA-SiBGC) and Landscape Disturbance and Succession with Net Ecosystem Carbon and Nitrogen (LANDIS-II NECN). We simulated past-decade conditions at flux tower sites located within Harvard Forest, MA, USA (HF-EMS) and Jones Ecological Research Center, GA, USA (JERC-RD). We mined field data available for both sites to perform model parameterization, validation, and intercomparison. We assessed model performance using the following time-series metrics: net ecosystem exchange, aboveground net primary production, aboveground biomass, C, and N, belowground biomass, C, and N, soil respiration, and, species total biomass and relative abundance. We also assessed static observations of soil organic C and N, and concluded with an assessment of general model usability, performance, and transferability. Despite substantial differences in design, both models achieved good accuracy across the range of pool metrics. While LANDIS-II NECN showed better fidelity to interannual NEE fluxes, PPA-SiBGC indicated better overall performance for both sites across the 11 temporal and 2 static metrics tested (HF-EMS [Formula] = 0.73, +0.07, [Formula] = 4.84, -10.02; JERC-RD [Formula] = 0.76, +0.04, [Formula] = 2.69, -1.86). To facilitate further testing of forest models at the two sites, we provide pre-processed datasets and original software written in the R language of statistical computing. In addition to model intercomparisons, our approach may be employed to test modifications to forest models and their sensitivity to different parameterizations.",

Here we show that the eggs of a solitary digger wasp, the European beewolf Philanthus triangulum, emit large amounts of the gaseous free radical nitric oxide (NO{dot}) to protect themselves and their provisions, paralyzed honeybees, against mold fungi. Despite the extraordinary concentrations of nitrogen radicals (NO{dot} and its oxidation product NO2{dot}) in the brood cells (~1500ppm), NO{dot} is synthesized from L-arginine by an NO-synthase (NOS) as in other animals. The beewolf NOS gene revealed no conspicuous differences to related species. However, due to alternative splicing, the NOS-mRNA in beewolf eggs lacks a 144bp exon near the regulatory domain. This preventive external application of high doses of NO{dot} by seemingly defenseless wasp eggs represents an evolutionary key innovation that adds a remarkable novel facet to the array of functions of the important biological effector NO{dot}.",

    "abstract": "DNA damage response (DDR) and selective autophagy both can be activated by reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), and both are of paramount importance in cancer development. The selective autophagy receptor and ubiquitin (Ub) sensor p62 plays a key role in their crosstalk. ROS production has been well documented in latent infection of oncogenic viruses including Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). However, p62-mediated selective autophagy and its interplay with DDR have not been investigated in these settings. In this study, we provide evidence that considerable levels of p62-mediated selective autophagy are constitutively induced, and correlates with ROS-Keap1-NRF2 pathway activity, in virus-transformed cells. Inhibition of autophagy results in p62 accumulation in the nucleus, and promotes ROS-induced DNA damage and cell death, as well as downregulates the DNA repair proteins CHK1 and RAD51. In contrast, MG132-mediated proteasome inhibition, which induces rigorous autophagy, promotes p62 degradation but accumulation of the DNA repair proteins CHK1 and RAD51. However, pretreatment with an autophagy inhibitor offsets the effects of MG132 on CHK1 and RAD51 levels. These findings imply that p62 accumulation in the nucleus in response to autophagy inhibition promotes proteasome-mediated CHK1 and RAD51 protein instability. This claim is further supported by the findings that transient expression of a p62 mutant, which is constitutively localized in the nucleus, in B cell lines with low endogenous p62 levels recaptures the effects of autophagy inhibition on CHK1 and RAD51 protein stability. These results indicate that proteasomal degradation of RAD51 and CHK1 is dependent on p62 accumulation in the nucleus. However, small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated p62 depletion in EBV-transformed lymphoblastic cell lines (LCLs) had no apparent effects on the protein levels of CHK1 and RAD51, likely due to the constitutive localization of p62 in the cytoplasm and incomplete knockdown is insufficient to manifest the effects on its nuclear function. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated p62 depletion in EBV-transformed LCLs results in significant increases of endogenous RNF168-{gamma}H2AX damage foci and chromatin ubiquitination, indicative of activation of RNF168-mediated DNA repair mechanisms. Our results have unveiled a pivotal role for p62-mediated selective autophagy that governs DDR in the setting of oncogenic virus latent infection, and provide a novel insight into virus-mediated oncogenesis.\n\nAuthor SummaryReactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) can induce both DNA damage response (DDR) and selective autophagy, which play crucial roles in cancer development. The selective autophagy receptor and ubiquitin (Ub) sensor p62 links their crosstalk. However, p62-mediated selective autophagy and its interplay with DDR have not been investigated in latent infection of oncogenic viruses including Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). In this study, we provide evidence that p62-mediated selective autophagy is constitutively induced in virus-transformed cells, and that its inhibition exacerbates ROS-induced DNA damage, and promotes proteasomal degradation of CHK1 and RAD51 in a manner depending on p62 accumulation in the nucleus. However, rigorous autophagy induction results in accumulation of DNA repair proteins CHK1 and RAD51, and p62 degradation. Further, transient expression of a constitutive nucleus-localizing mutant of p62 recaptured the effects of autophagy inhibition on CHK1 and RAD51 protein stability. These findings support the claim that p62 accumulation in the nucleus in response to autophagy inhibition promotes proteasome-mediated CHK1 and RAD51 protein instability. However, small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated p62 depletion did not affect CHK1 and RAD51 protein levels; rather, shRNA-mediated p62 depletion activates RNF168-dependent DNA repair mechanisms. Our results have unveiled a pivotal role for p62-mediated selective autophagy in regulation of DDR by overriding traditional DDR mechanisms in the setting of oncogenic virus latent infection, and provide a novel insight into the etiology of viral cancers.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing demand for a computationally efficient and accurate point process filter solution for real-time decoding of population spiking activity in multidimensional spaces. Real-time tools for neural data analysis, specifically real-time neural decoding solutions open doors for developing experiments in a closed-loop setting and more versatile brain-machine interfaces. Over the past decade, the point process filter has been successfully applied in the decoding of behavioral and biological signals using spiking activity of an ensemble of cells; however, the filter solution is computationally expensive in multi-dimensional filtering problems. Here, we propose an approximate filter solution for a general point-process filter problem when the conditional intensity of a cells spiking activity is characterized using a Mixture of Gaussians. We propose the filter solution for a broader class of point process observation called marked point-process, which encompasses both clustered - mainly, called sorted - and clusterless - generally called unsorted or raw- spiking activity. We assume that the posterior distribution on each filtering time-step can be approximated using a Gaussian Mixture Model and propose a computationally efficient algorithm to estimate the optimal number of mixture components and their corresponding weights, mean, and covariance estimates. This algorithm provides a real-time solution for multi-dimensional point-process filter problem and attains accuracy comparable to the exact solution. Our solution takes advantage of mixture dropping and merging algorithms, which collectively control the growth of mixture components on each filtering time-step. We apply this methodology in decoding a rats position in both 1-D and 2-D spaces using clusterless spiking data of an ensemble of rat hippocampus place cells. The approximate solution in 1-D and 2-D decoding is more than 20 and 4,000 times faster than the exact solution, while their accuracy in decoding a rat position only drops by less than 9% and 4% in RMSE and 95% HPD coverage performance metrics. Though the marked-point filter solution is better suited for real-time decoding problems, we discuss how the filter solution can be applied to sorted spike data to better reflect the proposed methodology versatility.",

Uterine endometrium is a dynamic tissue that undergoes cyclical shedding and reconstitution and is lined by a gland-forming epithelium. Whole genome sequencing of normal endometrial glands showed that most are clonal cell populations derived from a recent common ancestor with mutation burdens differing from other normal cell types and manyfold lower than endometrial cancers. Mutational signatures found ubiquitously account for most mutations. Many, in some women potentially all, endometrial glands are colonised by cell clones carrying driver mutations in cancer genes, often with multiple drivers. Total and driver mutation burdens increase with age but are also influenced by other factors including body mass index and parity. Clones with drivers often originate during early decades of life. The somatic mutational landscapes of normal cells differ between cell types and are revealing the procession of neoplastic change leading to cancer.",

    "abstract": "Immunological synapse (IS) formation between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell is accompanied by the reorientation of the T cell centrosome toward the interface. This polarization response is thought to enhance the specificity of T cell effector function by enabling the directional secretion of cytokines and cytotoxic factors toward the antigen-presenting cell. Centrosome reorientation is controlled by polarized signaling through diacylglycerol (DAG) and protein kinase C (PKC). This drives the recruitment of the motor protein dynein to the IS, where it pulls on microtubules to reorient the centrosome. Here, we used T cell receptor photoactivation and imaging methodology to investigate the mechanisms controlling dynein accumulation at the synapse. Our results revealed a remarkable spatiotemporal correlation between dynein recruitment to the synaptic membrane and the depletion of cortical filamentous actin (F-actin) from the same region, suggesting that the two events were causally related. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that pharmacological disruption of F-actin dynamics in T cells impaired both dynein accumulation and centrosome reorientation. DAG and PKC signaling were necessary for synaptic F-actin clearance and dynein accumulation, while calcium signaling and microtubules were dispensable for both responses. Taken together, these data provide mechanistic insight into the polarization of cytoskeletal regulators and highlight the close coordination between microtubule and F-actin architecture at the IS.",

In this study, we examined the microbiome in the oral cavity and atheromatous plaques from atherosclerosis patients with or without periodontitis to investigate the role of oral bacteria in the formation of atheromatous plaques. We chose four patients with and without periodontitis, who had undergone carotid endarterectomy. Bacterial samples were extracted from saliva on the tongue surface, from periodontal pocket (during the oral examination), and from the atheromatous plaques. We investigated the general and oral conditions from each patient and performed next-generation sequencing analysis for all bacterial samples. There were no significant differences between both groups concerning general conditions. However, the microbiome patterns of the gingival pocket showed differences depending on the absence or presence of periodontitis, while those of the saliva were relatively similar. The microbiome pattern of the atheromatous plaques was entirely different from that in saliva present on the tongue surface and gingival pocket, and oral bacteria were seldom detected. However, the microbiome pattern in atheromatous plaques was different in the presence or absence of periodontitis. These results indicated that oral bacteria did not affect the formation of atheromatous plaques directly. However, the metabolic products of microbiome or the host inflammatory response might indirectly influence the composition of atheromatous plaques.",

Machine learning has been applied to optimize sgRNA selection, but several challenges remain. The performance of predictive model is limited by the amount of available data in many cell lines, ignorance of gene network function and its variable effect on phenotype, and elusive biological interpretation of computational models. We develop an accurate and interpretable deep learning model SeqCrispr to address these problems. In benchmark studies, SeqCrispr outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and improves the prediction accuracy when applied to small sample size cell lines. Furthermore, we find that gene context-specific network properties are critical for the prediction accuracy in addition to the last three nucleotides in sgRNA 3end. Our findings will bolster developing more accurate predictive models of CRISPR-Cas9 across wide spectrum of biological conditions as well as efficient and safe gene therapy.",

    "abstract": "Loss of biological diversity through population extinctions is a global phenomenon that threatens many ecosystems. Managers often rely on databases of rare species locations to plan land use actions and conserve at-risk taxa, so it is crucial that the information they contain is accurate and dependable. However, climate change, small population sizes, and long gaps between surveys may be leading to undetected extinctions of many populations. We used repeated survey records for a rare but widespread orchid, Cypripedium fasciculatum (clustered ladys slipper), to model population extinction risk based on elevation, population size, and time between observations. Population size was negatively associated with extinction, while elevation and time between observations interacted such that low elevation populations were most vulnerable to extinction, but only over larger time spans. We interpret population losses at low elevations as a potential signal of climate change impacts. We used this model to estimate the probability of persistence of populations across California and Oregon, and found that 31%-56% of the 2415 populations reported in databases from this region are likely extinct. Managers should be aware that the number of populations of rare species in their databases is potentially an overestimate, and consider resurveying these populations to document their presence and condition, with priority given to older reports of small populations, especially those at low elevations or in other areas with high climate vulnerability.",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) represents a promising tool for disentangling differential associations between depression and fatigue and brain network function and connectivity. In this study we tested for associations between symptoms of fatigue and depression and DMN connectivity in patients with MS.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsSeventy-four MS patients were included on average 14 months after diagnosis. They underwent MRI scanning of the brain including rs-fMRI, and symptoms of fatigue and depression were assessed with Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI). A principal component analysis (PCA) on FSS and BDI scores was performed, and the component scores were analysed using linear regression models to test for associations with default mode network (DMN) connectivity.\\n\\nResultsWe observed higher DMN connectivity with higher scores on the primary principal component reflecting common symptom burden for fatigue and depression (Cohens f2=0.075, t=2.17, p=0.03). The secondary principal component reflecting a pattern of low fatigue scores with high scores of depression was associated with lower DMN connectivity (Cohens f2=0.067, t=-2.1, p=0.04). Using continuous mean scores of FSS we also observed higher DMN connectivity with higher symptom burden (t=3.1, p=0.003), but no significant associations between continuous sum scores of BDI and DMN connectivity (t=0.8, p=0.4).\\n\\nConclusionMultivariate decomposition of FSS and BDI data supported both overlapping and unique manifestation of fatigue and depression in MS patients. Rs-fMRI analyses showed that symptoms of fatigue and depression was reflected in altered DMN connectivity, and that higher DMN activity was seen in MS patients with fatigue even with low depression scores.",

To uncover how T. mercedesae responds to environmental stimuli inside a hive, we identified the sensilla-rich sensory organ on the foreleg tarsus. The organ contained four types of sensilla, which may respond to different stimuli based on their morphology. We found the forelegs were enriched with mRNAs encoding sensory proteins such as ionotropic receptors (IRs) and gustatory receptors (GRs), as well as proteins involved in ciliary transport. We also found that T. mercedesae and Drosophila melanogaster IR25a and IR93a are functionally equivalent. These results demonstrate that the structures and physiological functions of ancient IRs have been conserved during arthropod evolution. Our study provides insight into the sensory mechanisms of honey bee parasitic mites, as well as potential targets for methods to control the most serious honey bee pest.",

    "abstract": "Studying the impact of genetic variation on gene regulatory networks is essential to understand the biological mechanisms by which genetic variation causes variation in phenotypes. Bayesian networks provide an elegant statistical approach for multi-trait genetic mapping and modelling causal trait relationships. However, inferring Bayesian gene networks from high-dimensional genetics and genomics data is challenging, because the number of possible networks scales super-exponentially with the number of nodes, and the computational cost of conventional Bayesian network inference methods quickly becomes prohibitive. We propose an alternative method to infer high-quality Bayesian gene networks that easily scales to thousands of genes. Our method first reconstructs a node ordering by conducting pairwise causal inference tests between genes, which then allows to infer a Bayesian network via a series of independent variable selection problems, one for each gene. We demonstrate using simulated and real systems genetics data that this results in a Bayesian network with equal, and sometimes better, likelihood than the conventional methods, while having a significantly higher over-lap with groundtruth networks and being orders of magnitude faster. Moreover our method allows for a unified false discovery rate control across genes and individual edges, and thus a rigorous and easily interpretable way for tuning the sparsity level of the inferred network. Bayesian network inference using pairwise node ordering is a highly efficient approach for reconstructing gene regulatory networks when prior information for the inclusion of edges exists or can be inferred from the available data.",

    "abstract": "The most aggressive and invasive tumor cells often reside in hypoxic microenvironments and rely heavily on rapid anaerobic glycolysis for energy production. This switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, along with up-regulation of the glucose transport system, significantly increases the release of lactic acid from cells into the tumor microenvironment. Excess lactate and proton excretion exacerbate extracellular acidification to which cancer cells, but not normal cells, adapt. We have hypothesized that carbonic anhydrases (CAs) play a role in stabilizing both intracellular and extracellular pH to favor cancer progression and metastasis. Here we show that proton efflux (acidification) using the glycolytic rate assay is dependent on both extracellular pH (pHe) and CA IX expression. Yet, isoform selective sulfonamide-based inhibitors of CA IX did not alter proton flux, which suggests that the catalytic activity of CA IX is not necessary for this regulation. Other investigators have suggested the CA IX cooperates with the MCT transport family to excrete protons. To test this possibility, we examined the expression patterns of selected ion transporters and show that members of this family are differentially expressed within the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. The most aggressive form of breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), appears to coordinately express the monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) and carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX). This supports a possible mechanism that utilizes the intramolecular H+ shuttle system in CA IX to facilitate proton efflux through MCT4.",
