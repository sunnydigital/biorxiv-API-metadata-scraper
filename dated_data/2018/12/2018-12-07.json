    "abstract": "In both vertebrates and invertebrates, spatial patterning along the Dorsal-ventral (DV) embryonic axis depends on a morphogen gradient of Bone Morphogenetic Protein signaling. Scale invariance of DV patterning by BMPs has been found in both vertebrates and invertebrates, however the mechanisms that regulate gradient scaling remain controversial. To obtain quantitative data that can be used to address core questions of scaling, we introduce a method to tune the size of zebrafish embryos by reducing varying amounts of vegetal yolk. We quantified the BMP signaling gradient in wild-type and perturbed embryos and found that the system scales for reductions in cross-sectional perimeter of up to 30%. Furthermore, we found that the degree of scaling for intraspecies scaling within zebrafish is greater than that between Danioninae species.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) plays important roles in evolutionary and ecological studies. It becomes routine to utilize multiple genes on mitogenome or the entire mitogenomes to investigate phylogeny and biodiversity of focal groups with the onset of High Throughput Sequencing technologies. We developed a mitogenome toolkit MitoZ, consisting of independent modules of de novo assembly, findMitoScaf, annotation and visualization, that can generate mitogenome assembly together with annotation and visualization results from HTS raw reads. We evaluated its performance using a total of 50 samples of which mitogenomes are publicly available. The results showed that MitoZ can recover more full-length mitogenomes with higher accuracy compared to the other available mitogenome assemblers. Overall, MitoZ provides a one-click solution to construct the annotated mitogenome from HTS raw data and will facilitate large scale ecological and evolutionary studies.

    "abstract": "An inherited mutation is not always immediately toxic. Some mutations cause symptoms during youth, while other mutations cause symptoms during adulthood. Mutant animals that show delayed onset of disease symptoms may provide insights into mechanisms that maintain functional capacities during adulthood. Here, we take advantage of the relatively short lifespan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and develop a novel screening procedure to collect mutants with locomotor deficits that become apparent in adulthood. After ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis, we isolated five C. elegans mutant strains that progressively lose adult locomotor activity. In one of the mutant strains, a nonsense mutation in Elongator Complex Protein Component 2 (elpc-2) causes a progressive decline in locomotor function. Other C. elegans elpc mutants were also unable to maintain locomotor function during adulthood, indicating that the Elongator complex plays a critical role in maintaining locomotor healthspan in C. elegans.\\n\\nSignificance StatementTwo people with the same lifespan do not necessarily have the same healthspan. One person may retain locomotor and cognitive functions until the end of life, while another person may lose them during adulthood. Currently, the network of genes that regulate healthspan is largely unknown. Unbiased searches for genes that work to maintain functional capacities during adulthood may uncover key regulators of healthspan. Here we isolated five Caenorhabditis elegans mutant strains that progressively lose their locomotor function in adulthood. Mutant analysis suggests that the Elongator complex regulates locomotor healthspan. Mutants and mutations identified in the present screen may provide insights into mechanisms of age-related locomotor impairment and may provide clues for improving healthspan.",

    "abstract": "Secreted R-spondin1-4 proteins (RSPO1-4) orchestrate stem cell renewal and tissue homeostasis by potentiating Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. RSPOs induce the turnover of negative Wnt regulators RNF43 and ZNRF3 through a process that requires RSPO interactions with either Leucine-rich repeat containing G-protein coupled receptors (LGRs) or heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Here, we describe the engineering of  surrogate RSPOs that function independently of LGRs and HSPGs to enhance Wnt signaling on cell types expressing a target surface marker. These bispecific proteins were generated by fusing an RNF43- or ZNRF3-specific single chain antibody variable fragment (scFv) to the immune cytokine IL-2. Surrogate RSPOs mimic the function of natural RSPOs by crosslinking the extracellular domain (ECD) of RNF43 or ZNRF3 to the ECD of the IL-2 receptor CD25, which sequesters the complex and results in highly selective amplification of Wnt signaling on CD25+ cells. Furthermore, surrogate RSPOs were able substitute for wild type RSPO in a colon organoid growth assay when intestinal stem cells were transduced to express CD25. Our results provide proof-of-concept for a technology that may be adapted for use on a broad range of cell- or tissue-types and will open new avenues for the development of Wnt-based therapeutics for regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Activity-based therapies are routinely integrated in rehabilitation programs to induce repetitive activation of the neuromuscular system and facilitate functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). Among the beneficial effects of physical therapy is a reduction of hyperreflexia and spasticity in SCI individuals, but the precise mechanism by which exercise regulates spinal networks and facilitate recovery remains elusive. Spasticity is a debilitating condition that affects ~ 75% of the SCI population and interferes with residual motor function. Current pharmacological treatments not only have serious side effects but also actively depress spinal excitability and interferes with motor recovery. Understanding how activity-based therapies contribute to decrease spasticity will help identify critical pharmacological targets and optimize rehabilitation programs.\\n\\nKCC2, a neuron-specific Cl- extruder, is critical to the maintenance of [Cl-]i and its downregulation after SCI leads to a shift in chloride homeostasis that contributes to develop spasticity. We have shown in earlier studies that not only exercise promotes reflex modulation but also restores KCC2 expression in motoneurons. KCC2 is dynamically modulated by several signaling pathways, the most prevalent being BDNF-TrkB. Interestingly, activity-dependent processes triggered by exercise include an increase in the expression of BDNF in the lumbar spinal cord. However, whether the increase in KCC2 contributes to functional recovery and rely on BDNF activity have not been established. Our objective was to determine 1) whether the activity-dependent upregulation of KCC2 contributes to decrease spasticity after SCI; 2) if BDNF regulates KCC2 expression in an activity-dependent manner.\\n\\nUsing a model of complete SCI, we investigated this possible causal effect by intrathecally delivering VU0240551, a specific KCC2 blocker, or TrkB-IgG, a BDNF scavenger. Drugs were specifically delivered during the daily rehabilitation sessions to transiently prevent KCC2/BDNF activity. We provide evidence that the beneficial effect of exercise on functional recovery relies on a BDNF-dependent increase in KCC2 expression on motoneurons and the restoration of endogenous inhibition to a mature state. We identify, for the first time, that the increase in KCC2 activity with activity-based therapies functionally contributes to H-reflex recovery and critically depends on BDNF activity. This provides a new perspective on our understanding of how exercise impact hyperreflexia by identifying the biological basis of recovery of function. Acting directly on chloride homeostasis through BDNF to restore endogenous inhibition rather than actively depress excitability can diminish the reduction in motor output associated with the current pharmacological management of SCI and improve the outcome of rehabilitation programs.",

Guided by an iterative approach that combined biological screening and machine learning, we selected 214 odorants to characterise the response of MOR18-2 and its neighbouring glomeruli. We discovered several previously unknown odorants activating MOR18-2 glomeruli, and we obtained detailed MRRs of MOR18-2 glomeruli and their neighbours. Physico-chemical MRR descriptions revealed that the spatial layout of glomeruli followed a chemical logic. Our results confirm earlier findings that demonstrate a partial chemical map underlying glomerular arrangement in the dOB.

We find seven basic spatiotemporal patterns of activation, with fast and slow kinetics of initiation and propagation. Contrary to previous assumptions, both endodermal and ectodermal epitheliomuscular tissues are systematically activated jointly during contractions, in spite of their muscle fibers being orthogonally arranged. We also find that individual cells surprisingly participate in multiple patterns, using different kinetics of activation.

    "abstract": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are of great interest in cancer research, but methods for their enumeration remain far from optimal. We developed a new small animal research tool called \\\"Diffuse in vivo Flow Cytometry\\\" (DiFC) for detecting extremely rare fluorescently-labeled circulating cells directly in the bloodstream. The technique exploits near-infrared diffuse photons to detect and count cells flowing in large superficial arteries and veins without drawing blood samples. DiFC uses custom-designed, dual fiber optic probes that are placed in contact with the skin surface approximately above a major vascular bundle. In combination with a novel signal processing, algorithm DiFC allows counting of individual cells moving in arterial or venous directions, as well as measurement of their speed and depth. We show that DiFC allows sampling of the entire circulating blood volume of a mouse in under 10 minutes, while maintaining a false alarm rate of 0.014 per minute. Hence, the unique capabilities of DiFC are highly suited to biological applications involving very rare cell types such as the study of hematogenic cancer metastasis.",

    "abstract": "MotivationDeep immune receptor sequencing, Repseq, provides unprecedented opportunities to identify condition-associated T-cell clones, represented by T-cell receptor (TCR) CDR3 sequences. TCR profiling has potential value for increasing immunopathological understanding of various diseases, and holds considerable clinical relevance. However, due to the immense diversity of the immune repertoire, identification of condition relevant TCR CDR3s from total repertoires has so far been limited either to mostly \\\"public\\\" CDR3 sequences, which are shared across unrelated individuals, or to comparisons of CDR3 frequencies from multiple samples from the same individual. A methodology for the identification of condition-associated TCR CDR3s by population level comparison of groups of Repseq samples is currently lacking.\\n\\nResultsWe implemented a computational pipeline that allows population level comparison of Repseq sample groups at the level of the immune repertoire sub-units that are shared across individuals. These sub-units (or sub-repertoires) represent shared immuno-genomic features across individuals that potentially encode common signatures in the immune response to antigens. The method first performs unsupervised clustering of CDR3 sequences within each sample based on their similarity in nucleotide or amino acid subsequence frequency. Next, it finds matching clusters across samples, the immune sub-repertoires, and performs statistical differential abundance testing at the level of the identified sub-repertoires. We applied the method on total TCR CDR3{beta} Repseq datasets of celiac disease patients in gluten exposed and unexposed conditions, as well as on public dataset of yellow fever vaccination volunteers before and after immunization. The method successfully identified condition-associated CDR3{beta} sequences, as evidenced by considerable agreement of TRBV-gene and positional amino acid usage patterns in the detected CDR3{beta} sequences with previously known CDR3{beta} species relevant to celiac disease. The method also recovered significantly high numbers of previously known CDR3{beta} sequences, relevant to each condition than would be expected by chance. We conclude that immune sub-repertoires of similar immuno-genomic features, shared across unrelated individuals, encode common immunological information. Moreover, they can serve as viable units of population level immune repertoire comparison, serving as proxy for identification of condition-associated CDR3 sequences.",

    "abstract": "In designing experimental crosses of inbred strains of model organisms, researchers must make a number of decisions. These include the selection of the appropriate strains, the cross design (eg. F2 intercross), and the number of progeny to collect (sample size). These decisions strongly influence the potential for a successful quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping experiment; good design decisions will lead to efficient and effective science. Thus experimental design deserves careful consideration and planning. Experimental outcomes can be quantified through utility functions using a Bayesian decision theoretic approaches. For QTL mapping experiments, the power to map a QTL is an appealing utility function to maximize. Using any utility function to aid in experimental design will be dependent on assumptions, such as the QTL effect size in the case of power. Rather than arbitrarily selecting QTL effect size values, they can be estimated from pilot data using a Bayesian hierarchical model. The information in the pilot data can be propagated to the utility function, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from the posterior distribution. Key features of this approach include: 1) distributional summaries of utility, which are preferable to point estimates, and 2) a comprehensive search of the experimental space of crosses of inbred lines for well-designed experiments. We evaluate this Bayesian theoretic approach using diallel crosses as the pilot data. We present results from simulations as well as present examples from both Mendelian and complex traits in the founder strains of the mouse Collaborative Cross. All analyses were performed using our R package, DIDACT (Diallel-Informed Decision theoretic Approach for Crosses Tool), developed to perform Bayesian cross selection based on diallel pilot data.",

For that reason safeguarding genetic variation is considered fundamental to maintaining biodiversity, and is an Aichi Target for 20204. As human activities are driving declines in many wild populations5, genetic variation is also likely declining. However the magnitude of ongoing genetic variation loss has not been assessed, despite its importance. Here we show a 6% decline in within-population genetic variation of wild organisms since the industrial revolution. The erosion of genetic variation has been most severe for island species, with an 18% average decline. We also identified several key taxonomic and geographic information gaps that must be urgently addressed. Our results are consistent with single time-point meta-analyses that indicated genetic variation is likely declining 6,7.

Despite the increasing popularity of eDNA, several questions regarding its limitations remain to be addressed. We investigated the effect of sampling medium and time, and preservation methods, on fish detection performance based on eDNA metabarcoding of neotropical freshwater samples. Water and sediment samples were collected from 11 sites along the Jequitinhonha River, Southeastern Brazil; sediment samples were stored in ethanol, while the same amounts of water per sample (3L) were stored in a cool box with ice, as well as by adding the cationic surfactant Benzalkonium chloride (BAC). Sediment and water samples yielded a similar amount of fish MOTUs (237 vs 239 in the first sampling event, and 153 vs 142 in the second sampling event). Water stored in ice provided better results than those preserved in BAC (239 and 142 vs 194 and 71 MOTUs). While documenting the effectiveness of eDNA surveys as practical tools for fish biodiversity monitoring in poorly accessible areas, we showed that keeping water samples cooled results in greater eDNA recovery and taxon detection than by adding cationic surfactants as sample preservatives. Furthermore, by comparing two sets of samples collected from the same locations at a three-week interval, we highlight the importance of conducting multiple sampling events when attempting to recover a realistic picture of fish assemblages in lotic systems.",

To better understand transcriptional regulatory mechanism driving heart development and the consequences of its disruption, we isolated cardiomyocytes (CMs) from wild-type zebrafish embryos at 24, 48 and 72 hours post fertilization corresponding to heart looping, chamber formation and heart maturation, and from mutant lines carrying loss-of-function mutations in gata5, tbx5a and hand2, transcription factors (TFs) required for proper heart development. The integration of CM transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and genome-wide chromatin accessibility maps (ATAC-seq) unravelled dynamic regulatory networks driving crucial events of heart development. These networks contained key cardiac TFs including Gata5/6, Nkx2.5, Tbx5/20, and Hand2, and are associated with open chromatin regions enriched for DNA sequence motifs belonging to the family of the corresponding TFs. These networks were disrupted in cardiac TF mutants, indicating their importance in proper heart development. The most prominent gene expression changes, which correlated with chromatin accessibility modifications within their proximal promoter regions, occurred between heart looping and chamber formation, and were associated with metabolic and hematopoietic/cardiac switch during CM maturation. Furthermore, loss of function of cardiac TFs Gata5, Tbx5a, and Hand2 affected the cardiac regulatory networks and caused global changes in chromatin accessibility profile. Among regions with differential chromatin accessibility in mutants were highly conserved non-coding elements which represent putative cis regulatory elements with potential role in heart development and disease. Altogether, our results revealed the dynamic regulatory landscape at key stages of heart development and identified molecular drivers of heart morphogenesis.",

Twenty subjects of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, for all but one of whom English was not the primary language, viewed 8 patches of different colour in two Mondrian displays; each patch, when viewed, was made to reflect identical ratios of long-, middle- and short-wave light. Subjects were asked to match the colour of the viewed patch with that of the Munsell chip coming closest in colour to that of the viewed patch, without using language. Overall, there was no variability in categorizing colours as red, yellow, brown and green but a small variability in categorizing them as purple, blue, orange and turquoise. In terms of hue, we found significantly less variability in matching  warm hues than in  cool ones. We interpret the lack of significant variability between subjects in the matches made as a pointer to similar computational mechanisms being employed in different subjects to perceive colours, thus permitting subjects to assume that their categorization of colours has universal agreement and assent.",

    "abstract": "Elevated hearing thresholds in hearing impaired adults are usually compensated by providing amplification through a hearing aid. In spite of restoring hearing sensitivity, difficulties with understanding speech in noisy environments often remain. One main reason is that sensorineural hearing loss not only causes loss of audibility but also other deficits, including peripheral distortion but also central temporal processing deficits. To investigate the neural consequences of hearing impairment in the brain underlying speech-in-noise difficulties, we compared EEG responses to natural speech of 14 hearing impaired adults with those of 14 age-matched normal-hearing adults. We measured neural envelope tracking to sentences and a story masked by different levels of a stationary noise or competing talker. Despite their sensorineural hearing loss, hearing impaired adults showed higher neural envelope tracking of the target than the competing talker, similar to their normal-hearing peers. Furthermore, hearing impairment was related to an additional increase in neural envelope tracking of the target talker, suggesting that hearing impaired adults may have an enhanced sensitivity to envelope modulations or require a larger differential tracking of target versus competing talker to neurally segregate speech from noise. Lastly, both normal-hearing and hearing impaired participants showed an increase in neural envelope tracking with increasing speech understanding. Hence, our results open avenues towards new clinical applications, such as neuro-steered prostheses as well as objective and automatic measurements of speech understanding performance.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAdults with hearing impairment can neurally segregate speech from background noise\nC_LIO_LIHearing loss is related to enhanced neural envelope tracking of the target talker\nC_LIO_LINeural envelope tracking has potential to objectively measure speech understanding\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Organisms have evolved a range of behavioural and physiological responses which minimize the impact of infection on fitness. When future reproductive potential is threatened, for example, as a result of pathogenic infection, the terminal investment hypothesis predicts that individuals will respond by investing preferentially in current reproduction. Terminal investment involves reallocating resources to current reproductive effort, so it is likely to be influenced by the quantity and quality of resources acquired through diet. Dietary protein specifically has been shown to impact both immunity and reproductive output in a range of organisms, but its impact on terminal investment during infection is unclear. We tested the effect of dietary protein on terminal investment in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster following oral exposure to the opportunist bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Oral exposure to bacteria triggered an increase in reproductive investment, but we find that the nature of the terminal investment strategy depended on the level of dietary protein. Flies feeding on a high protein diet increased the number of eggs laid when exposed to P. aeruginosa, while flies fed an isocaloric, lower protein diet did not increase the number of eggs laid but instead showed an increase in egg-to-adult viability following infection. We discuss the importance of considering diet and natural routes of infection when measuring non-immunological defenses.",

We report the identification of a protein that exhibits asymmetric localization between mother and daughter centrosomes in asymmetrically dividing Drosophila male germline stem cells (GSCs). We show that Alms1a, a Drosophila homolog of the causative gene for the human ciliopathy Alstrom Syndrome, is a ubiquitous mother centriole protein with a unique additional localization to the daughter centriole only in the mother centrosome of GSCs. Depletion of alms1a results in rapid loss of centrosomes due to failure in daughter centriole duplication. We reveal that alms1a is specifically required for centriole duplication in asymmetrically dividing cells but not in symmetrically dividing differentiating cells in multiple stem cell lineages. The unique requirement of alms1a in asymmetric dividing cells may shed light onto the molecular mechanisms of Alstrom syndrome pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Rodents are the main animal model to study sleep. Yet, in spite of a large consensus on the distinction between rapid-eye-movements sleep (REM) and non-REM sleep (NREM) in both humans and rodent, there is still no equivalent in mice of the NREM subdivision classically described in humans.\\n\\nHere we propose a classification of sleep stages in mice, inspired by human sleep scoring. By using chronic recordings in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus we can classify three NREM stages with a stage N1 devoid of any low oscillatory activity and N3 with a high density of delta waves. These stages displayed the same evolution observed in human during the whole sleep or within sleep cycles. Importantly, as in human, N1 in mice is the first stage observed at sleep onset and is increased after sleep fragmentation in Orexin-/- mice, a mouse model of narcolepsy.\\n\\nWe also show that these substages are associated to massive modification of neuronal activity. Moreover, considering these stages allows to predict mPFC neurons evolution of firing rates across sleep period. Notably, neurons preferentially active within N3 decreased their activity over sleep while the opposite is seen for those preferentially active in N1 and N2.\\n\\nOverall this new approach shows the feasibility of NREM sleep sub-classification in rodents, and, in regard to the similarity between sleep in both species, will pave the way for further studies in sleep pathologies given the perturbation of specific sleep substages in human pathologies such as insomnia, somnambulism, night terrors, or fibromyalgia.",

We developed and validated on protein sequences a regressive algorithm that works the other way around, aligning first the most dissimilar sequences. Our algorithm produces more accurate alignments than non-regressive methods, especially on datasets larger than 10,000 sequences.

    "abstract": "The basidiomycete smut fungi are predominantly plant parasitic, causing severe losses in some crops. Most species feature a saprotrophic haploid yeast stage, and several smut fungi are only known from this stage, with some isolated from habitats without suitable hosts, e.g. from Antarctica. Thus, these species are generally believed to be apathogenic, but recent findings that some of these might have a plant pathogenic sexual counterpart, casts doubts on the validity of this hypothesis. Here, four Pseudozyma genomes were re-annotated and compared to published smut pathogens and the well-characterised effector gene Pep1 from these species was checked for its ability to complement a Pep1 deletion strain of Ustilago maydis. It was found that 113 high-confidence putative effector proteins were conserved among smut and Pseudozyma genomes. Among these were several validated effector proteins, including Pep1. By genetic complementation we show that Pep1 homologs from the supposedly apathogenic yeasts restore virulence in Pep1-deficient mutants Ustilago maydis. Thus, it is concluded that Pseudozyma species have retained a suite of effectors. This hints at the possibility that Pseudozyma species have kept an unknown plant pathogenic stage for sexual recombination or that these effectors have positive effects when colonising plant surfaces.",

Shotgun sequencing technologies allow for much more comprehensive profiling. Here, we develop and apply MetaRibo-Seq, a method for simultaneous ribosome profiling of multiple taxa within a complex bacterial community. This approach captures taxonomic diversity in fecal samples. As expected, the detected ribosome-bound transcripts are relatively enriched within coding regions and significantly correlate to detectable protein abundances. In a low diversity fecal sample, we show that MetaRibo-Seq is more strongly correlated than metatranscriptomic data to protein abundance. This significant correlation of metatranscriptomics and MetaRibo-Seq with protein levels is maintained, though with decreased strength as taxonomic diversity increases. Finally, we identify genes that are consistently regulated at the translational level across bacterial taxa within fecal communities. In conclusion, MetaRibo-Seq enables comprehensive translational profiling in complex bacterial communities for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Chagas disease was described by Carlos Chagas, who first identified the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi from a two-year-old girl called Berenice. Many T. cruzi sequencing projects based on short reads have demonstrated that genome assembly and downstream comparative analyses are extremely challenging in this species, given that half of its genome is composed of repetitive sequences. Here, we report de novo assemblies, annotation and comparative analyses of the Berenice strain using a combination of Illumina short reads and MinION long reads. Our work demonstrates that Nanopore sequencing improves T. cruzi assembly contiguity and increases the assembly size in ~16 Mb. Specifically, we found that assembly improvement also refines the completeness of coding regions for both single copy genes and repetitive transposable elements. Beyond its historical and epidemiological importance, Berenice constitutes a fundamental resource since it now represents the best-quality assembly available for TcII, a highly prevalent lineage causing human infections in South America. The availability of Berenice genome expands the known genetic diversity of T. cruzi and facilitates more comprehensive evolutionary inferences. Our work represents the first report of Nanopore technology used to resolve complex protozoan genomes, supporting its subsequent application for improving trypanosomatid and other highly repetitive genomes.",

Specifically, this project utilized LC/MS/MS and LC/QTOF/MS to accurately quantify levels of six purine molecules in samples from cultured N2a murine neuroblastoma cells. The targeted metabolomics workflow was integrated with automated label-free digital microscopy, which enabled normalization of purine concentration per unit cell in the absence of fluorescent dyes. The established method offered significantly enhanced selectivity compared to previously published procedures. In addition, this study demonstrates that a simple, quantitative targeted metabolomics approach can be developed to identify and quantify purine metabolites in biological samples. We envision that this method could be broadly applicable to quantification of purine metabolites from other complex biological samples, such as cerebrospinal fluid or blood.",

    "abstract": "The concomitant folding of a nascent protein domain with its synthesis can generate mechanical forces that act on the ribosome and alter translation speed. Such changes in speed can affect the structure and function of the newly synthesized protein as well as cellular phenotype. The domain properties that govern force generation have yet to be identified and understood, and the influence of translation speed is unknown as all reported measurements have been carried out on arrested ribosomes. Here, using coarse-grained molecular simulations and statistical mechanical modeling of protein synthesis, we demonstrate that force generation is determined by a domains stability and topology, as well as translation speed. The statistical mechanical models we create predict how force profiles depend on these properties. These results indicate that force measurements on arrested ribosomes will not always accurately reflect what happens in a cell, especially for slow-folding domains, and suggest the possibility that certain domain properties may be enriched or depleted across the structural proteome of organisms through evolutionary selection pressures to modulate protein synthesis speed and post-translational protein behavior.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMechanochemistry, the influence of molecular-scale mechanical forces on chemical processes, can occur on actively translating ribosomes through the force-generating actions of motor proteins and the co-translational folding of domains. Such forces are transmitted to the ribosomes catalytic core and alter rates of protein synthesis; representing a form of mechanical allosteric communication. These changes in translation-elongation kinetics are biologically important because they can influence protein structure, function, and localization within a cell. Many fundamental questions are unresolved concerning the properties of protein domains that determine mechanical force generation, the effect of translation speed on this force, and exactly how, at the molecular level, force is generated. In this study we answer these questions using cutting-edge molecular simulations and statistical mechanical modeling.",
