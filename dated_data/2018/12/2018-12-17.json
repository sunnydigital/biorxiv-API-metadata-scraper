    "abstract": "Cellular proteostasis is maintained by stress-responsive signaling pathways such as the heat shock response (HSR), the oxidative stress response (OSR), and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Activation of these pathways results in the transcriptional upregulation of select subsets of stress-responsive genes that restore proteostasis and adapt cellular physiology to promote recovery following various types of acute insult. The capacity for these pathways to regulate cellular proteostasis makes them attractive therapeutic targets to correct proteostasis defects associated with diverse diseases. High-throughput screening (HTS) using cell-based reporter assays is highly effective for identifying putative activators of stress-responsive signaling pathways. However, the development of these compounds is hampered by the lack of medium-throughput assays to define compound potency and selectivity for a given pathway. Here, we describe a targeted RNA sequencing (RNAseq) assay that allows cost effective, medium-throughput screening of stress-responsive signaling pathway activation. We demonstrate that this assay allows deconvolution of stress-responsive signaling activated by chemical genetic or pharmacologic agents. Furthermore, we use this assay to define the selectivity of putative OSR and HSR activating compounds previously identified by HTS. Our results demonstrate the potential for integrating this adaptable targeted RNAseq assay into screening programs focused on developing pharmacologic activators of stress-responsive signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Early detection of age-related diseases will greatly benefit from a model of the underlying biological aging process. In this paper, we develop a brain-age predictor by using structural magnetic resonance imaging (SMRI) and deep learning and evaluate the predicted brain age as a marker of brain-aging in Alzheimer's disease. Our approach does not require any domain knowledge in that it trains end-to-end on the SMRI image itself, and has been validated on real SMRI data collected from elderly subjects. We developed two different models by using convolutional neural network (CNN) based regression and bucket classification to predict brain ages from SMRI images. Our models achieved root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 5.54 and 6.44 years in predicting brain ages of healthy subjects. Further analysis showed that there is a substantial difference between the predicted brain ages of cognitively impaired and healthy subjects with similar chronological ages.",

One mechanism by which temperature may affect stability is by altering trophic interactions.

To these data we fitted a population dynamic model including the predator functional response, such that the functional response parameters (space clearance rate, handling time, and density dependence of space clearance rate) were estimated for each temperature separately. To evaluate the ecological significance of temperature effects on the functional response parameters we simulated predator-prey population dynamics.

Within these niches, the soft rot Enterobacteriaceae (SRE) comprise an emerging group of plant-pathogens inflicting soft rot/black-leg diseases and causing economic losses worldwide in a variety of crops. In this report, a range of molecular and computational techniques are utilized to survey the contribution of antimicrobial factors such as bacteriocins, carbapenem antibiotic and type VI secretion system (T6SS) in interbacterial competition among plant-pathogens/endophytes using an aggressive SRE as a case study (Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliense strain PBR1692 - Pcb1692). A preliminary screening using next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA comparatively analysing healthy and diseased potato tubers, followed by in vitro competition assays, corroborated the aggressiveness of Pcb1692 against several relevant taxa sharing this niche ranging from Proteobacteria to Firmicutes. The results showed growth inhibition of several Proteobacteria by Pcb1692 depends either on carbapenem or pyocin production. Whereas for targeted Firmicutes, only pyocin seems to play a role in growth inhibition by Pcb1692. Further analyses elucidated that although T6SS confers no relevant advantage during in vitro competition, a significant attenuation in competition by the mutant strain lacking a functional T6SS was observed in planta. Furthermore, production of carbapenem by Pcb1692 was observably dependent on the presence of environmental iron and oxygen. Additionally, upon deletion of fur, slyA and expI regulators, carbapenem production ceased, implying a complex regulatory mechanism involving these three genes. Potential Fur binding sites found upstream of slyA, carR and expR in Pectobacterium genomes harboring carbapenem-associated genes further suggests a conserved regulatory pattern in the genus, in which carbapenem might be modulated in response to iron through the control exerted by Fur over secondary regulators. Furthermore, we unveiled the striking role played by S-pyocin in growth inhibition within the SRE group.\\n\\nAuthors SummaryFor many phytopathogenic bacteria, more is known about interactions within the host and virulence factors used for host colonisation while relatively less is known about microbe-microbe interactions and factors that shape niche colonisation. The soft rot Enterobacteriaceae (SRE) comprise an emerging group of phytopathogens causing soft rot/black-leg diseases in a variety of crops leading to huge economic losses worldwide. In this report, a range of molecular and computational techniques are utilized to survey the contribution of antimicrobial factors such as bacteriocins, carbapenem antibiotic and type VI secretion system (T6SS) in interbacterial competition among plant-pathogens/endophytes using an aggressive SRE as a case study (Pcb1692). Our results show that Pcb1692 inhibits growth of other SRE and several potato endophytes using either the type VI secretion, carbapenem or bacteriocins. Carbapenem plays a role in both inter and intrabacterial competition in vitro, while the Pcb1692T6SS plays a role in interbacterial competition in planta (in potato tubers). We also demonstrate that carbapenem regulation requires the presence of environmental iron and oxygen in a complex network consisting of Pcb1692 Fur, SlyA, and ExpI. The presence of these gene homologs in several SREs suggests that they too can deploy similar antimicrobials to target other bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Studies using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) are increasingly collecting data at multiple sites in order to speed up recruitment or increase sample size. The main objective of this study was to assess the long-term consistency of rsfMRI connectivity maps derived at multiple sites and vendors using the Canadian Dementia Imaging Protocol (CDIP, www.cdip-pcid.ca). Nine to ten minutes of functional BOLD images were acquired from an adult cognitively healthy volunteer scanned repeatedly at 13 Canadian sites on three scanner makes (General Electric, Philips and Siemens) over the course of 2.5 years. The consistency (spatial Pearsons correlation) of rsfMRI connectivity maps for seven canonical networks ranged from about 0.4-0.8 (intra-site) to 0.3-0.8 (inter-vendor), with a negligible effect of time. We noted systematic differences in data quality across vendors, which may also explain some of these results. We also pooled the long-term longitudinal data with a single-site, short-term (1 month) data sample acquired on 26 subjects (10 scans per subject), called HNU1. Using randomly selected pairs of scans from each subject, we quantified the ability of a data-driven unsupervised cluster analysis to match two scans of the same subjects. In this \\\"fingerprinting\\\" experiment, we found that scans from the Canadian subject (Csub) could be matched with high accuracy intra-site (>95% for some networks), but that the accuracy decreased substantially for scans drawn from different sites and vendors, while still remaining in the range of accuracies observed in HNU1. Overall, our results demonstrate good multivariate stability of rsfMRI measures over several years, but substantial impact of scanning site and vendors. How detrimental these effects are will depend on the application, yet improving methods for harmonizing multisite analysis is an important area for future work.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIConsistency of rsfMRI connectivity over 2.5 years, 13 sites and 3 scanner vendors\\nC_LIO_LITime elapsed between scans had negligible effect on consistency\\nC_LIO_LIConsistency decreased due to site and vendor differences\\nC_LIO_LIAccuracy of connectivity fingerprints decreased due to site and vendor differences\\nC_LI\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=181 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/497743v2_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (54K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@109bab7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c1720corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12678e2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ca494d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract\\n\\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Accurate decision-making requires estimating the uncertainty of perceptual events. Temporal attention is known to enhance the selection of a stimulus at a relevant time, but how does this selective process affect a decisions confidence? Here, we adapted an \\\"Attentional blink\\\" paradigm to investigate the effect of temporal attention on confidence judgments. In a RSVP stream of letters, two targets were cued to induce two successive attentional episodes. We found that the confidence ratings given to an item systematically followed the probability with which this item was reported. This coupling made confidence oblivious to selection delays usually observed when the two targets were separated by long intervals (249ms to 747ms). In particular, during this period, confidence was higher for more delayed item selection. One exception to this relationship between confidence and temporal selection was found when the second target appeared soon after (83ms) the first attentional episode. Here, a strong under-confidence bias was observed. Importantly, however, this early confidence bias did not impact confidence sensitivity in discriminating correct and erroneous responses. These results suggest that temporal attention and confidence can operate at different time scales, a difference which seems to reflect high-level heuristic biases rather than segregated processes for decision and confidence evidence.",

    "abstract": "Kisspeptin within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus is a critical neuropeptide in the regulation of reproduction. Together with neurokinin B and dynorphin A, arcuate kisspeptin provides the oscillatory activity that drives the pulsatile secretion of GnRH, and therefore LH pulses, and is believed to be a central component of the GnRH pulse generator. It is well established that the amygdala also exerts an influence over gonadotrophic hormone secretion and reproductive physiology. The discovery of kisspeptin and its receptor within the posterodorsal medial amygdala (MePD), and our recent finding showing that intra-MePD administration of kisspeptin or a kisspeptin receptor antagonist results in increased LH secretion and decreased LH pulse frequency, respectively, suggests an important role for amygdala kisspeptin signalling in the regulation of the GnRH pulse generator. To further investigate the function of amygdala kisspeptin, the present study used an optogenetic approach to selectively stimulate MePD kisspeptin neurones and examine the effect on pulsatile LH secretion. MePD kisspeptin neurones in conscious Kiss1-CRE mice were virally infected to express a channelrhodopsin protein and selectively stimulated by light via a chronically implanted fibre optic cannula. Continuous stimulation using 5 Hz resulted in an increased LH pulse frequency, which was not observed at the lower stimulation frequencies of 0.5 and 2 Hz. In wild-type animals, continuous stimulation at 5 Hz did not affect LH pulse frequency. These results demonstrate that selective activation of MePD Kiss1 neurons can modulate hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator frequency.",

    "abstract": "Hi-C experiments have become very popular for studying the 3D genome structure in recent years. Identification of long-range chromosomal interaction, i.e., peak detection, is crucial for Hi-C data analysis. But it remains a challenging task due to the inherent high dimensionality, sparsity and the over-dispersion of the Hi-C count data matrix. We propose EBHiC, an empirical Bayes approach for peak detection from Hi-C data. The proposed framework provides flexible over-dispersion modeling by explicitly including the 'true' interaction intensities as latent variables. To implement the proposed peak identification method (via the empirical Bayes test), we estimate the overall distributions of the observed counts semiparametrically using a smoothed EM algorithm, and the empirical null by discrete curve fitting. We conducted extensive simulations to validate and evaluate the performance of our proposed approach and applied it to real datasets. Our results suggest that EBHiC can better identify peaks than Fit-Hi-C in terms of accuracy, biological interpretability, and the consistency across biological replicates.",

Specifically, we can characterize the phytochemical landscape by asking how a larger number of individual compounds affect herbivores and how compounds covary among plants. Here we use the recent colonization of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) by the Melissa blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa) to quantify plant metabolites and the performance of caterpillars as affected by both individual compounds and suites of covarying phytochemicals. We find that survival, development time and adult weight are all associated with variation in nutrition and toxicity, including biomolecules associated with plant cell function as well as putative anti-herbivore action. The plant-insect interface is complex, with clusters of covarying compounds in many cases encompassing divergent effects on different aspects of caterpillar performance. Individual compounds with the strongest associations are largely specialized metabolites, including alkaloids, phenolic glycosides and saponins. The saponins are represented in our data by more than 25 individual compounds with beneficial and detrimental effects on L. melissa caterpillars, which highlights the value of metabolomic data as opposed to approaches that rely on total concentrations within broad defensive classes.",

Mitochondrial and genome-wide DNA sequence variation in eight baleen whale and seven prey species revealed strong, ocean-wide demographic changes that were correlated with changes in global temperatures and regional oceanographic conditions. In the Southern Ocean baleen whale and prey abundance increased exponentially and in apparent synchrony, whereas changes in abundance varied among species in the more heterogeneous North Atlantic Ocean. The estimated changes in whale abundance correlated with increases in the abundance of prey likely driven by reductions in sea-ice cover and an overall increase in primary production. However, the specific regional oceanographic environment, trophic interactions and species ecology also appeared to play an important role. Somewhat surprisingly the abundance of baleen whales and prey continued to increase for several thousand years after global temperatures stabilized. These findings warn of the potential for dramatic, long-term effects of current climate changes on the marine ecosystem.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe effects of past global warming on marine ecosystems were drastic, system-wide and long-lasting.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, conserved mechanisms ensure that cell growth is coordinated with nutrient availability. Overactive growth during nutrient limitation (\"nutrient-growth dysregulation\") can lead to rapid cell death. Here, we demonstrate that cells can adapt to nutrient-growth dysregulation by evolving major metabolic defects. Specifically, when yeast lysine auxotrophic mutant lys- encountered lysine limitation, an evolutionarily novel stress, cells suffered nutrient-growth dysregulation. A sub-population repeatedly evolved to lose the ability to synthesize organosulfurs (lys-orgS-). Organosulfurs, mainly glutathione and glutathione conjugates, were released by lys- cells during lysine limitation when growth was dysregulated, but not during glucose limitation when growth was regulated. Limiting organosulfurs conferred a frequency-dependent fitness advantage to lys-orgS- by eliciting a proper slow growth program including autophagy. Thus, nutrient-growth dysregulation is associated with rapid organosulfur release, which enables the selection of organosulfur auxotrophy to better tune cell growth to the metabolic environment. We speculate that evolutionarily novel stresses can trigger atypical release of certain metabolites, setting the stage for the evolution of new ecological interactions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThoracic aortic dissection is an emergent life-threatening condition. Routine screening for genetic variants causing thoracic aortic dissection is not currently performed for patients or their family members.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed whole exome sequencing of 240 patients with thoracic aortic dissection (n=235) or rupture (n=5) and 258 controls matched for age, sex, and ancestry. Blinded to case-control status, we annotated variants in 11 genes for pathogenicity.\\n\\nResultsTwenty-four pathogenic variants in 6 genes (COL3A1, FBN1, LOX, PRKG1, SMAD3, TGFBR2) were identified in 26 individuals, representing 10.8% of aortic cases and 0% of controls. Among dissection cases, we compared those with pathogenic variants to those without and found that pathogenic variant carriers had significantly earlier onset of dissection (41 vs. 57 years), higher rates of root aneurysm (54% vs. 30%), less hypertension (15% vs. 57%), lower rates of smoking (19% vs. 45%), and greater incidence of aortic disease in family members. Multivariable logistic regression showed significant risk factors associated with pathogenic variants are age <50 [odds ratio (OR) = 5.5; 95% CI: 1.6-19.7], no history of hypertension (OR=5.6; 95% CI: 1.4-22.3) and family history of aortic disease (mother: OR=5.7; 95% CI: 1.4-22.3, siblings: OR=5.1; 95% CI 1.1-23.9, children: OR=6.0; 95% CI: 1.4-26.7).\\n\\nConclusionsClinical genetic testing of known hereditary thoracic aortic dissection genes should be considered in patients with aortic dissection, followed by cascade screening of family members, especially in patients with age-of-onset of aortic dissection <50 years old, family history of aortic disease, and no history of hypertension.",

We report the structure-guided development of mammalian cell-expressed candidate vaccine immunogens based on influenza A group 2 H3 and H7 HA stem trimers displayed on self-assembling ferritin nanoparticles using an iterative, multipronged approach involving helix stabilization, loop optimization, disulfide bond addition, and side chain repacking. These immunogens were thermostable, formed uniform and symmetric nanoparticles, were recognized by cross-group-reactive broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) with nanomolar affinity, and elicited protective, homosubtypic antibodies in mice. Importantly, several immunogens were able to activate B cells expressing inferred unmutated common ancestor (UCA) versions of cross-group-reactive human bNAbs from two multi-donor classes, suggesting they could initiate elicitation of these bNAbs in humans.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, undergoes drastic morphological and biochemical modifications as it passes between hosts and transitions from extracellular to intracellular stages. The osmotic and mechanical aspects of these cellular transformations are not understood. Here we identify and characterize a novel mechanosensitive channel in T. cruzi (TcMscS) belonging to the superfamily of small conductance mechanosensitive channels (MscS). TcMscS is activated by membrane tension and forms a large pore permeable to anions, cations, and small osmolytes. The channel changes its location from the contractile vacuole complex in epimastigotes to the plasma membrane as the parasites develop into intracellular amastigotes. TcMscS knockout parasites show significant fitness defects, including increased cell volume, calcium dysregulation, impaired differentiation, and a dramatic decrease in infectivity. Our work provides mechanistic insights into components supporting pathogen adaptation inside the host thus opening the exploration of mechanosensation as a prerequisite of protozoan infectivity.",

    "abstract": "Salinity and pH are important environmental parameters with direct and indirect impacts on the viability and metabolic activities of microorganisms. In this study, the effects of salt and alkaline stresses on the kinetic balance between nitrous oxide (N2O) production and consumption in the denitrification pathway of Dechloromonas aromatica strain RCB were examined. N2O accumulated transiently only in insignificant amounts at low salinity ([&le;]0.5% NaCl) and circumneutral pH (7.0 and 7.5). Incubation at 0.7% salinity resulted in substantially longer lag phase and slower growth rate, along with the increase in the amounts of transiently accumulated N2O (15.8{+/-}2.8 moles N2O-N/vessel). Incubation at pH 8.0 severely inhibited growth and resulted in permanent accumulation of 29.9{+/-}1.3 moles N2O-N/vessel from reduction of 151{+/-}20 moles NO3-. The transcription analyses observed decreased nosZ/(nirS1+nirS2) ratios coinciding with N2O accumulation. The N2O consumption rates of resting D. aromatica cells subjected to the salt and alkaline stress conditions were significantly lower than the rates of N2O production from NO2- reduction at N2O / NO2- concentration of 0.1 mM, but not at a higher concentration (1.0 mM). These results indicate that alteration in N2O consumption kinetics was another cause of enhanced N2O production observed under the stress conditions. The findings in this study suggest that canonical denitrifiers may become a significant N2O source when faced with abrupt environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria can acquire an accessory genome through the horizontal transfer of genetic elements from non-parental lineages. This leads to rapid genetic evolution allowing traits such as antibiotic resistance and virulence to spread through bacterial communities. The study of complete genomes of bacterial strains helps to understand the genomic traits associated with virulence and antibiotic resistance. We aimed to investigate the complete accessory genome of an ocular isolate of P. aeruginosa. We obtained the complete genome of the ocular isolate strain PA34 of P. aeruginosa utilising genome sequence reads from Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technology followed by PCR to close any identified gaps. In-depth genomic analysis was performed using various bioinformatics tools. The phenotypic properties of susceptibility to heavy metals and cytotoxicity were determined to confirm expression of certain traits. The complete genome of PA34 includes a chromosome of 6.8 Mbp and two plasmids of 95.4 Kbp (pMKPA34-1) and 26.8 Kbp (pMKPA34-2). PA34 had a large accessory genome of 1,213 genes and had 543 unique genes not present in other strains. These exclusive genes encoded features related to metal and antibiotic resistance, phage integrase and transposons. At least 24 GIs were predicated in the complete chromosome, of which two were integrated into novel sites. Eleven GIs carried virulence factors or replaced pathogenic genes. A bacteriophage carried the aminoglycoside resistance gene (aac(3)-IId). The two plasmids carried other six antibiotic resistance genes. The large accessory genome of this ocular isolate plays a large role in shaping its virulence and antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "What information single neurons receive about general neural circuit activity is a fundamental question for neuroscience. Somatic membrane potential fluctuations are driven by the convergence of synaptic inputs from a diverse cross-section of upstream neurons. Furthermore, neural activity is often scale-free implying that some measurements should be the same, whether taken at large or small scales. Together, convergence and scale-freeness support the hypothesis that single membrane potential recordings carry useful information about high-dimensional cortical activity. Conveniently, the theory of \\\"critical branching networks\\\" (a purported explanation for scale-freeness) provides testable predictions about scale-free measurements which are readily applied to membrane potential fluctuations. To investigate, we obtained whole-cell current clamp recordings of pyramidal neurons in visual cortex of turtles with unknown genders. We isolated fluctuations in membrane potential below the firing threshold and analyzed them by adapting the definition of \\\"neuronal avalanches\\\" (spurts of population spiking). The membrane potential fluctuations we analyzed were scale-free and consistent with critical branching. These findings recapitulated results from large-scale cortical population data obtained separately in complementary experiments using microelectrode arrays (previously published (Shew et al., 2015)). Simultaneously recorded single-unit local field potential did not provide a good match; demonstrating the specific utility of membrane potential. Modeling shows that estimation of dynamical network properties from neuronal inputs is most accurate when networks are structured as critical branching networks. In conclusion, these findings extend evidence for critical branching while also establishing subthreshold pyramidal neuron membrane potential fluctuations as an informative gauge of high-dimensional cortical population activity.",

    "abstract": "Most people envision themselves as operant agents endowed with the capacity to bring about changes in the outside world. This ability to monitor one's own causal power has long been suggested to rest upon a specific model of causal inference, i.e., a model of how our actions causally relate to their consequences. What this model is and how it may explain departures from optimal inference, e.g., illusory control and self-attribution biases, are still conjecture. To address this question, we designed a series of novel experiments requiring participants to continuously monitor their causal influence over the task environment by discriminating changes that were caused by their own actions from changes that were not. Comparing different models of choice, we found that participants' behaviour was best explained by a model deriving the consequences of the forgone action from the current action that was taken and assuming relative divergence between both. Importantly, this model agrees with the intuitive way of construing causal power as \\\"difference-making\\\" in which causally efficacious actions are actions that make a difference to the world. We suggest that our model outperformed all competitors because it closely mirrors people's belief in their causal power - a belief that is well-suited to learning action-outcome associations in controllable environments. We speculate that this belief may be part of the reason why reflecting upon one's own causal power fundamentally differs from reasoning about external causes.",

    "abstract": "Background: Brain health relies on a tightly regulated system known as neurovascular function whereby the cellular constituents of the neurovascular unit (NVU) regulate cerebral haemodynamics in accordance with neuronal metabolic demand. Disruption of neurovascular function impairs brain health and is associated with the development of disease, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The NVU is the site of action of neuroinflammatory responses and contributes to the transition of systemic inflammation to neuroinflammatory processes. Thus, systemic inflammatory challenges may cause a shift in the NVU focus, prioritising neuroimmune over neurovascular actions leading to altered neurovascular function. Methods: Rats were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (2mg/kg) or vehicle and haemodynamic responses to sensory and non-sensory (hypercapnia) stimuli were assessed in vivo. Following imaging, animals were perfused and their brain extracted to histologically characterise components of the NVU to determine the association between underlying pathology to altered blood flow regulation in vivo. Results: LPS-treated animals showed altered haemodynamic function and cerebrovascular dynamics 6 hours after LPS administration. Histological assessment identified a significant increase in astrogliosis, microgliosis and endothelial activation in LPS-treated animals. Conclusions: Our data shows that an acutely induced systemic inflammatory response is able to rapidly alter in-vivo haemodynamic function and is associated with significant changes in the cellular constituents of the NVU. We suggest that these effects are initially mediated by endothelial cells, which are directly exposed to the circulating inflammatory stimulus and have been implicated in regulating functional hyperaemia.",

    "abstract": "Acute pancreatitis (AP) is acute inflammation of the pancreas, mainly caused by gallstones and alcohol, driven by changes in communication between cells. Heparin-binding proteins (HBPs) play a central role in health and diseases. Therefore, we used heparin affinity proteomics to identify extracellular HBPs in pancreas and plasma of normal mice and in a caerulein mouse model of AP. Many new extracellular HBPs (360) were discovered in the pancreas, taking the total number of HBPs known to 786. Extracellular pancreas HBPs form highly interconnected protein-protein interaction networks in both normal pancreas (NP) and AP. Thus, HBPs represent an important set of extracellular proteins with significant regulatory potential in the pancreas. HBPs in NP are associated with biological functions such as molecular transport and cellular movement that underlie pancreatic homeostasis. However, in AP HBPs are associated with additional inflammatory processes such as acute phase response signalling, complement activation and mitochondrial dysfunction, which has a central role in the development of AP. Plasma HBPs in AP included known AP biomarkers such as serum amyloid A, as well as emerging targets such as histone H2A. Other HBPs such as alpha 2-HS glycoprotein (AHSG) and histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) need further investigation for potential applications in the management of AP. Pancreas HBPs are extracellular and so easily accessible and are potential drug targets in AP, whereas plasma HBPs represent potential biomarkers for AP. Thus, their identification paves the way to determine which HBPs may have potential applications in the management of AP.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella aerogenes is a nosocomial pathogen associated with drug resistance and outbreaks in intensive care units. In a 5-month period in 2017, we experienced an increased incidence of cultures for carbapenem-resistant K. aerogenes (CR-KA) from an adult cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CICU) involving 15 patients. Phylogenomic analysis following whole-genome sequencing (WGS) identified the outbreak CR-KA isolates to group together as a tight clonal cluster (<7 SNPs apart), suggestive of a protracted intra-ward transmission event. No clonal relationships were identified between the CICU CR-KA strains and additional hospital CR-KA patient isolates from different wards and/or previous years. Genes encoding carbapenemases or drug-resistant plasmids were absent in the outbreak strains, and carbapenem resistance was attributed to mutations impacting AmpD activity and membrane permeability. The CICU outbreak strains harbored an integrative conjugative element (ICEKp10), which has been associated with pathogenicity in hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae lineages. Comparative genomics with global K. aerogenes genomes showed our outbreak strains to group closely with global ST4 strains, which along with ST93 likely represent dominant K. aerogenes lineages associated with human infections. WGS is a powerful tool that goes beyond high-resolution tracking of transmission events into identifying the genetic basis of drug-resistance and virulence, which are not part of conventional diagnostic workflows. With an increasing availability of sequenced genomes from across the globe, population structure analysis offers opportunities to identify emerging trends and dominant clones associated with specific syndromes and geographical locations for poorly characterized pathogens.",

    "abstract": "PRDM9 has been identified as a meiosis-specific protein that plays a key role in determining the location of meiotic recombination hotspots. Although it is well-established that PRDM9 is a trans-acting factor directing the double strand break machinery necessary for recombination to its DNA binding site, the details of PRDM9 binding and complex formation are not well known. It has been suggested in several instances that PRDM9 acts as a multimer in vivo; however, there is little understanding about the protein stoichiometry or the components inducing PRDM9 multimerization. In this work, we used in vitro binding studies and mass spectrometry to characterize the size of the PRDM9 multimer within the active DNA-protein complex of two different murine PRDM9 alleles, PRDM9Cst and PRDM9Dom2. For this purpose, we developed a strategy to infer the molecular weight of the PRDM9-DNA complex from native gel electrophoresis based on gel shift assays (EMSAs). Our results show that PRDM9 binds as a trimer with the DNA. This multimerization is catalysed by the long ZnF array (ZnF) at the C-terminus of the protein and 11, 10, 7 or 5 ZnFs are already sufficient to form a functional trimer. Finally, we also show that only one ZnF-array within the PRDM9 trimer actively binds to the DNA, while the remaining two ZnF-arrays likely maintain the multimer by ZnF-ZnF interactions. Our results have important implications in terms of PRDM9 dosage, which determines the number of active hotspots in meiotic cells, and contribute to elucidate the molecular interactions of PRDM9 with other components of the meiotic initiation machinery.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To estimate the neural current distribution underlying magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals and to link such estimates to brain anatomy, MEG data have to be co-registered with an anatomical image, typically an MR image. Optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs) enable the construction of on-scalp MEG systems providing higher sensitivity and spatial resolution than conventional SQUID-based MEG systems. Here, we present a co-registration method that can be applied to on-scalp MEG systems, regardless of the number of channels. Methods: We apply a structured-light 3D scanner to create a surface mesh of the subject's head and the sensor array, which we fit to the MR image. To assess accuracy, we quantified the reproducibility of the surface mesh and localized current dipoles embedded in a phantom. Finally, we measured somatosensory evoked fields (SEF) to median nerve stimulation and compared their source estimates with those obtained with a SQUID-based MEG system. Results: The structured-light scanner reproduced the head surface with < 1 mm error. Phantom dipoles were localized with a mean error of 2.14 mm. The difference in SEF dipole positions between OPMs and SQUIDs were 5.0, 0.9, and 1.6 mm for N20m, P35m and P60m response peaks, respectively. Conclusion: The developed co-registration is inexpensive, fast and can easily be applied to on-scalp MEG. It is also more convenient to use than traditional co-registration methods while also being more accurate. Significance: We developed and validated a co-registration method that can be applied to on-scalp MEG systems. The method enables accurate source estimation with these novel MEG systems.",

    "abstract": "Dengue case management is an alarmingly important global health issue. The effective allocation of resources is often difficult due to external and internal factors imposing nonlinear fluctuations in the prevalence of dengue fever. We aimed to construct an early-warning system that could accurately forecast subsequent dengue cases in three dengue endemic regions, namely San Juan, Iquitos, and the Philippines. The problem is solely regarded as a time series forecasting problem ignoring the known epidemiology of dengue fever as well as the other meteorological variables. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is a popular classical time series model for linear data structures whereas with the advent of neural networks, nonlinear structures in the dataset can be handled. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model combining ARIMA and neural network autoregressive (NNAR) model to capture both linearity and nonlinearity in the datasets. The ARIMA model filters out linear tendencies in the data and passes on the residual values to the NNAR model. The proposed hybrid approach is applied to three dengue time-series data sets and is found to give better forecasting accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art. The results of this study indicate that dengue cases can be accurately forecasted over a sufficient time period using the proposed hybrid methodology.",

Although many biological systems show rhythmicity, there is no general-purpose tool to simulate large-scale, rhythmic data. Here we present Simphony, an R package for simulating data from experiments in which the abundances of rhythmic and non-rhythmic features (e.g., genes) are measured at multiple time points in multiple conditions. Simphony has parameters for specifying experimental design and each feature's rhythmic properties (e.g., shape, amplitude, and phase). In addition, Simphony can sample measurements from Gaussian and negative binomial distributions, the latter of which approximates read counts from next-generation sequencing data. We show an example of using Simphony to benchmark a method for detecting rhythms. Our results suggest that Simphony can aid experimental design and computational method development.

    "abstract": "Identifying the A- and P-site locations on ribosome-protected mRNA fragments from Ribo-Seq experiments is a fundamental step in the quantitative analysis of transcriptome-wide translation properties at the codon level. Many analyses of Ribo-Seq data have utilized heuristic approaches applied to a narrow range of fragment sizes to identify the A-site. In this study, we use Integer Programming to identify A-site by maximizing an objective function that reflects the fact that the ribosomes A-site on ribosome-protected fragments must reside between the second and stop codons of an mRNA. This identifies the A-site location as a function of the fragments size and its 5{square} end reading frame in Ribo-Seq data generated from S. cerevisiae and mouse embryonic stem cells. The correctness of the identified A-site locations is demonstrated by showing that this method, as compared to others, yields the largest ribosome density at established stalling sites. By providing greater accuracy and utilization of a wider range of fragment sizes, our approach increases the signal-to-noise ratio of underlying biological signals associated with translation elongation at the codon length scale.",

Empirically-based predictive models of the spatial distribution of these species would aid surveillance and vector control efforts. To predict the occurrence and abundance of these species, we fit mixed-effects zero-inflated negative binomial regression to a mosquito surveillance dataset with records from more than 200,000 trap days, covering 73% of the land area and ranging from 2004 to 2018 in Florida. We found an asymmetrical competitive interaction between adult populations of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus for the sampled sites. Wind speed was negatively associated with the occurrence and abundance of both vectors. Our model predictions show high accuracy (72.9% to 94.5%) in the validation tests leaving out a random 10% subset of sites and data from 2018, suggesting a potential for predicting the distribution of the two Aedes vectors.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR/Cas9 system enables the editing of genomes of numerous organisms through the induction of the double-strand breaks (DSB) at specific chromosomal targets. We improved the CRISPR/Cas9 system to ease the direct introduction of a point mutation or a tagging sequence into the chromosome by combining it with the microhomology mediated end joining (MMEJ)-based genome editing in fission yeast. We constructed convenient cloning vectors, which possessed a guide RNA (gRNA) expression module, or the humanized Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 gene that is expressed under the control of an inducible promoter to avoid the needless expression, or both a gRNA and Cas9 gene. Using this system, we attempted the MMEJ-mediated genome editing and found that the MMEJ-mediated method provides high-frequency genome editing at target loci without the need of a long donor DNA. Using short oligonucleotides, we successfully introduced point mutations into two target genes at high frequency. We also precisely integrated the sequences for epitope and GFP tagging using donor DNA possessing microhomology into the target loci, which enabled us to obtain cells expressing N-terminally tagged fusion proteins. This system could expedite genome editing in fission yeast, and could be applicable to other organisms.",

    "abstract": "Reconciling transcription and DNA replication in the growing hyphae of the filamentous bacterium Streptomyces presents several physical constraints on growth due to their apically extending and branching, multigenomic cells and chromosome replication being independent of cell division. Using a GFP translational fusion to the {beta}-subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoC-egfp), in its native chromosomal location, we observed growing Streptomyces hyphae using time-lapse microscopy throughout the lifecycle and under different growth conditions. The RpoC-eGFP fusion co-localised with DNA around 1.8 m behind the extending tip, whereas replisomes localise around 4-5 m behind the tip, indicating that at the growing tip, transcription and chromosome replication are to some degree spatially separated. Dual-labeled RpoC-egfp/DnaN-mCherry strains also indicate that there is limited co-localisation of transcription and chromosome replication at the extending hyphal tip. This likely facilitates the use of the same DNA molecule for active transcription and chromosome replication in growing cells, independent of cell division. This represents a novel, but hitherto unknown mechanism for reconciling two fundamental processes that utilise the same macromolecular template that allows for rapid growth without compromising chromosome replication in filamentous bacteria and may have implications for evolution of filamentous growth in microorganisms, where uncoupling of DNA replication from cell division is required.",

    "abstract": "Immunity and nutrition are two essential modulators of individual fitness However, while the implications of immune function and nutrition on an individual s lifespan and reproduction are known, the interplay between feeding behaviour, infection, and immune function, remains poorly understood. In this study, we used the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate how infection through septic injury modulates nutritional intake, and how macronutrient balance affects survival to infection by the pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus. Our results show that infected flies maintain carbohydrate intake, but reduce protein intake, thereby shifting from a protein-to-carbohydrate (P:C) ratio of ~1:4 to ~1:10 relative to non-infected and sham-infected flies. Strikingly, we found that the proportion of flies dying after M. luteus infection was significantly lower when flies were fed a low-P high-C diet, revealing that flies shift their macronutrient intake as means of nutritional self-medication against bacterial infection. This is likely due to the effects of macronutrient balance on the regulation of the constitutive expression of innate immune genes, as a low-P high-C diet was linked to an up-regulation in the expression of key antimicrobial peptides. Together, our results reveal the intricate relationship between macronutrient intake and resistance to infection, and integrate the molecular cross-talk between metabolic and immune pathways into the framework of nutritional immunology.",

Improved characterisation of Mtb/HIV coinfection as a distinct disease state may lead to better identification and treatment of affected individuals.\\n\\nMethodsFour previously published TB and HIV co-infection related datasets were used to train and validate multinomial machine learning classifiers that simultaneously predict TB and HIV status. Classifier predictive performance was measured using leave-one-out cross validation on the training set and blind predictive performance on multiple test sets using area under the ROC curve (AUC) as the performance metric. Linear modelling of signature gene expression was applied to systematically classify genes as TB-only, HIV-only or combined TB/HIV.\\n\\nResultsThe optimal signature discovered was a single 10-gene random forest multinomial signature that robustly discriminates active tuberculosis (TB) from other non-TB disease states with improved performance compared with previously published signatures (AUC: 0. 87), and specifically discriminates active TB/HIV co-infection from all other conditions (AUC: 0.88). Signature genes exhibited a variety of transcriptional patterns including both TB-only and HIV-only response genes and genes with expression patterns driven by interactions between HIV and TB infection states, including the CD8+ T-cell receptor LAG3 and the apoptosis-related gene CERKL.\\n\\nConclusionsBy explicitly including distinct disease states within the machine learning analysis framework, we developed a compact and highly diagnostic signature that simultaneously discriminates multiple disease states associated with Mtb/HIV co-infection. Examination of the expression patterns of signature genes suggests mechanisms underlying the unique inflammatory conditions associated with active TB in the presence of HIV. In particular, we observed that disregulation of CD8+ effector T-cell and NK-cell associated genes may be an important feature of Mtb/HIV co-infection.",

Clearly, its crucial to quantify how much we can trust population trend data. Yet many studies analyzing large numbers of population time series lack a straightforward way to estimate confidence in each trend. Here we artificially degrade 27,930 waterbird population time series to see how often subsets of the data correctly estimate the direction and magnitude of each populations true trend. We find you need to sample many years to be confident that there is no significant trend in a population. Conversely, if a significant trend is detected, even from only a small subset of years, this is likely to be representative of the populations true trend. This means that if a significant decline is detected in a population, it is likely to be correct and conservation action should be taken immediately, but if the trend is insignificant, confidence in this can only be high with many samples. Our full results provide a clear and quantitative way to assign confidence to species trends, and lays the foundation for similar studies of other taxa that can help to add rigor to large-scale population analyses.",

    "abstract": "During meiosis, programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are formed by the topoisomerase-like enzyme, Spo11, activating the DNA damage response (DDR) kinase Mec1ATR via the checkpoint clamp loader, Rad24RAD17. At single loci, loss of Mec1 and Rad24 activity alters Spo11-dependent DSB formation and recombination outcome, but their genome-wide roles have not been examined in detail. Here we utilise two distinct methods to characterise the roles Mec1 and Rad24 play in meiotic recombination--deletion of the mismatch repair protein, Msh2, and control of meiotic prophase length via regulation of the Ndt80 transcription factor--to enable genome-wide mapping of meiotic progeny. In line with previous studies, we observe a reduction in the frequency of recombination upon deletion of RAD24--driven by a shortened prophase. By contrast, loss of Mec1 function increases recombination frequency, consistent with its role in DSB trans-interference. Despite this difference in recombination rate, complex, multi-chromatid events initiated by closely spaced DSBs--a rare event in wild type cells--occur more frequently in the absence of either Rad24 or Mec1, suggesting a loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation. We further demonstrate that Mec1 and Rad24 also have important, yet distinct, roles in the spatial regulation of crossovers (COs). Specifically, excess DSBs forming in the absence of Mec1 are disproportionately channelled into the non-crossover (NCO) and non-interfering CO pathways, reducing the global strength of interference without an explicit change in the frequency of interfering COs. In direct contrast, loss of Rad24 weakens interference via a reduction in the apparent number of interfering COs--similar, but less extreme, to the phenotype of  ZMM mutants such as zip3{Delta}. Collectively, our results highlight novel and unique roles for Rad24 within meiotic recombination--beyond those mediated by activation of Mec1--and describe new roles for the DDR in several important aspects of meiosis.",

We apply the model to diverse phenotypes and validate the implementation with simulations. We find model polygenicities ranging from [~=] 2 x 10-5 to [~=] 4 x 10-3, with discoverabilities similarly ranging over two orders of magnitude. A power analysis allows us to estimate the proportions of phenotypic variance explained additively by causal SNPs at current sample sizes, and map out sample sizes required to explain larger portions of additive SNP heritability.

    "abstract": "Proximity ligation based techniques, like HiC, involve restriction digestion followed by ligation of formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin. We showed that the HiC datasets have significant bias due to differential accessibility of chromatin domains to restriction endonucleases. Through analysis of lamina-associated domains (LADs), inactive X-chromosome in mammals and polytene bands in fly, we established that the DNA in condensed chromatin had lesser accessibility to nucleases used in HiC as compared to that in decondensed chromatin. The observed bias was independent of known systematic biases attributed to length and GC content of the restriction fragments and was not appropriately corrected by computational methods. We identified novel condensed domains outside LADs, which were bordered by insulators and were dynamically associated with the developmentally regulated epigenetic and transcriptional states. Our observations suggested that the corrected read counts of existing HiC datasets can be reliably repurposed to study the dynamics of chromatin condensation and decondensation and that the existing HiC datasets should be interpreted with cautions.",

    "abstract": "Sequencing of newly synthesized RNA can monitor transcriptional dynamics with great sensitivity and high temporal resolution, but is currently restricted to populations of cells. Here, we developed newly synthesized alkylation-dependent single-cell RNA sequencing (NASC-seq), to monitor both newly synthesized and pre-existing RNA in single cells. We validated the method on pre-alkylated exogenous spike-in RNA, and by demonstrating that more newly synthesized RNA was detected for genes with known high mRNA turnover. Importantly, NASC-seq reveals rapidly up- and down-regulated genes during the T-cell activation, and RNA sequenced for induced genes were essentially only newly synthesized. Moreover, the newly synthesized and preexisting transcriptomes after T-cell activation were distinct confirming that we indeed could simultaneously measure gene expression corresponding to two time points in single cells. Altogether, NASC-seq is a powerful tool to investigate transcriptional dynamics and it will enable the precise monitoring of RNA synthesis at flexible time periods during homeostasis, perturbation responses and cellular differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly heritable mood disorder with complex genetic architecture and poorly understood etiology. We performed a whole blood transcriptome analysis in a BD case-control sample (Nsubjects = 480) by RNA sequencing. While we observed widespread differential gene expression patterns between affected and unaffected individuals, these effects were largely linked to lithium treatment at the time of blood draw (FDR < 0.05, Ngenes = 976) rather than BD diagnosis itself (FDR < 0.05, Ngenes = 6). These lithium-associated genes were enriched for cell signaling and immune response functional annotations, among others, and were associated with neutrophil cell-type proportions, which were elevated in lithium users. Neither genes with altered expression in cases nor in lithium users were enriched for BD, schizophrenia, and depression genetic risk based on information from genome-wide association studies, nor was gene expression associated with polygenic risk scores for BD. Our findings suggest that BD is associated with minimal changes in whole blood gene expression independent of medication use but underline the importance of accounting for medication use and cell type heterogeneity in psychiatric transcriptomic studies. The results of our study add to mounting evidence of lithium's cell signaling and immune-related mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 100 years, oil spills and long-term waste deposition from oil refineries have significantly polluted the environment. These contaminants have widespread negative effects on human health and ecosystem functioning. Natural attenuation of long chain and polyaromatic hydrocarbons is slow and often incomplete. Bioaugmentation of polluted soils with indigenous bacteria that naturally consume petroleum hydrocarbons could speed up this process. However, the characterization of bacterial crude oil degradation efficiency--which often relies upon expensive, highly specialized gas-chromatography mass spectrometry analyses--can present a substantial bottleneck in developing and implementing these bioremediation strategies. Here, we develop a low-cost, rapid, high-throughput fluorescence-based assay for identifying wild-type bacteria that degrade crude oil using the dye Nile Red. We show that Nile Red fluoresces when in contact with crude oil and developed a robust linear model to calculate crude oil content in liquid cell cultures based on fluorescence intensity (FI). To test whether this assay could identify bacteria with enhanced metabolic capacities to break down crude oil, we screened bacteria isolated from a former Shell Oil refinery in Bay Point, CA and identified one strain (Cupriavidus sp. OPK) with superior crude oil depletion efficiencies (up to 83%) in only three days. We further illustrate that this assay can be combined with fluorescence microscopy to study how bacteria interact with crude oil and the strategies they use to degrade this complex substance. We show for the first time that bacteria use three key strategies for degrading crude oil: biofilm formation, direct adherence to oil droplets, and vesicle encapsulation of oil. We propose that the quantitative and qualitative data from this assay can be used to develop new bioremediation strategies based on bioaugmentation and/or biomimetic materials that imitate the natural ability of bacteria to degrade crude oil.",

    "abstract": "Mediation analysis has been a popular framework for elucidating the mediating mechanism of the exposure effect on the outcome. Previous literature in causal mediation primarily focused on the classical settings with univariate exposure and univariate mediator, with recent growing interests in high dimensional mediator. In this paper, we study the mediation model with high dimensional exposure and high dimensional mediator, and introduce two procedures for mediator selection, MedFix and MedMix. MedFix is our new application of adaptive lasso with one additional tuning parameter. MedMix is a novel mediation model based on high dimensional linear mixed model, for which we also develop a new variable selection algorithm. Our study is motivated by the causal gene identification problem, where causal genes are defined as the genes that mediate the genetic effect. For this problem, the genetic variants are the high dimensional exposure, the gene expressions the high dimensional mediator, and the phenotype of interest the outcome. We evaluate the proposed methods using a mouse f2 dataset for diabetes study, and extensive real data driven simulations. We show that the mixed model based approach leads to higher accuracy in mediator selection and mediation effect size estimation, and is more reproducible across independent measurements of the response and more robust against model misspecification.

    "abstract": "In medical, scientific and political arenas relating to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) there is currently an intense focus on multi-drug resistant pathogens that render last-line antimicrobial treatments ineffective. We question the current emphasis of attention on resistance to last-line antimicrobials, arguing that tackling resistance to front-line antimicrobials has a greater public health benefit. Using AMR monitoring data on 25 drug-pathogen combinations from across Europe, here we show that the presence of front-line pathogen resistance initiates a cascade of resistance selection that ultimately leads to pathogen resistance to last-line antimicrobials. We then interrogate, by modelling the dynamics of resistance evolution, whether 3 key interventions in the strategic response to AMR are more effectively targeted at front-line or last-line treatment. We show that interventions that make front-line therapy more effective by use of antimicrobial adjuvants or front-line resistance diagnostics or by introduction of a novel, front-line antimicrobial all lead to a larger reduction in mortality and morbidity than the same interventions implemented in last-line therapy. Mass use of a newly discovered antimicrobial in front-line infection management to maximise its public health benefit is contrary to current policy but may provide valuable incentives for drug developers. We demonstrate that funding, publications, and attention to those publications do not reflect the importance of front-line antimicrobials and are disproportionately devoted to last-line antimicrobials that account for less than 10% of antimicrobial prescriptions. While studying resistance to last-line drugs is undoubtedly important, our work relays a strong message to public health agencies, funding bodies, and researchers that allocating resources to front-line infections can be a more effective way to combat the antimicrobial resistance crisis.",

    "abstract": "The standard genome-wide association studies (GWAS) detects an association between a single variant and a phenotype of interest. Recently, several studies reported that at many risk loci, there may exist multiple causal variants. For a locus with multiple causal variants with small effect sizes, the standard association test is underpowered to detect the associations. Alternatively, an approach considering effects of multiple variants simultaneously may increase statistical power by leveraging effects of multiple causal variants. In this paper, we propose a new statistical method, Model-based Association test Reflecting causal Status (MARS), that tries to find an association between variants in risk loci and a phenotype, considering the causal status of the variants. One of the main advantages of MARS is that it only requires the existing summary statistics to detect associated risk loci. Thus, MARS is applicable to any association study with summary statistics, even though individual level data is not available for the study. Utilizing extensive simulated data sets, we show that MARS increases the power of detecting true associated risk loci compared to previous approaches that consider multiple variants, while robustly controls the type I error. Applied to data of 44 tissues provided by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium, we show that MARS identifies more eGenes compared to previous approaches in most of the tissues; e.g. MARS identified 16% more eGenes than the ones reported by the GTEx consortium. Moreover, applied to Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC) data, we demonstrate that MARS effectively identifies association loci with improved power (56% of more loci found by MARS) inGWAS studies compared to the standard association test.",

    "abstract": "Why a pathogen associates with one host but not another is one of the most important questions in disease ecology. Here we use transcriptome sequencing of wild-caught bumblebees from 13 species to describe their natural viruses, and to quantify the impact of evolutionary history on the realised associations between viruses and their pollinator hosts. We present 37 novel virus sequences representing at least 30 different viruses associated with bumblebees. We verified 17 of them by PCR and estimate their prevalence across species in the wild. Through small RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that at least 10 of these viruses form active infections in wild individuals. Using a phylogenetic mixed model approach, we show that the evolutionary history of the host shapes the current distribution of virus/bumblebee associations. Specifically, we find that related hosts share viral assemblages, viruses differ in their prevalence averaged across hosts and the prevalence of infection in individual virus-host pairings depends on precise characteristics of that pairing.\n\nAuthors SummaryDespite the importance of disease in the regulation of animal populations, our understanding of the distribution of pathogen burden across wild communities remains in its infancy. In this study, we investigated the distribution of viruses across natural populations of 13 different bumblebee species in Scotland. We first searched for viruses using a metatranscriptomic approach, finding at least 30 new viruses of bumblebees, and assayed a subset of them for their presence and absence in different host species. Then, in the first application of these methods to an animal-virus system, we used co-phylogenetic mixed models to investigate the factors that lead to species being having different prevalences for a subset of these viruses. While much of the variation in the prevalence of the viruses can be explained by the idiosyncrasies of individual bumblebee-virus pairings, there is a phylogenetic signal with related bumblebee species being infected at similar frequencies by the same sets of viruses. Consistent with previous work, our study indicates that, while in general the interaction between a host and a virus may be unpredictable, closely related species are more likely to exhibit similar patterns of infection.",

We used the pattern of fold change in metabolites representing pathway level differences as reference for metabolic control analysis (MCA) using the model. MCA revealed parameters constituting the HPA axis, inflammation and GPCR pathway that yielded metabolic dysfunction consistent with PTSD. To support this, we performed causal analysis between regulatory components and the significantly different metabolites in our sample. Causal inference revealed that the changes in glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity were mechanistically associated with metabolic dysfunction and the effects were jointly mediated by insulin resistance, inflammation, oxidative stress and energy deficit.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic perturbations such as harvesting often select against a large body size and are predicted to induce rapid evolution towards smaller body sizes and earlier maturation. However, body-size evolvability and, hence, adaptability to anthropogenic perturbations remain seldom evaluated in wild populations. Here, we use a laboratory experiment over 6 generations to measure the ability of wild-caught medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) to evolve in response to bidirectional size-dependent selection mimicking opposite harvest regimes. Specifically, we imposed selection against a small body size (Large line), against a large body size (Small line) or random selection (Control line), and measured correlated responses across multiple phenotypic, life-history and endocrine traits. As expected, the Large line evolved faster somatic growth and delayed maturation, but also evolved smaller body sizes at hatch, with no change in average levels of pituitary gene expressions of luteinizing, folliclestimulating or growth (GH) hormones. In contrast, the Small medaka line was unable to evolve smaller body sizes or earlier maturation, but evolved smaller body sizes at hatch and showed marginally-significant signs of increased reproductive investment, including larger egg sizes and elevated pituitary GH production. Natural selection on medaka body size was too weak to significantly hinder the effect of artificial selection, indicating that the asymmetric body-size response to size-dependent selection reflected an asymmetry in body-size evolvability. Our results show that trait evolvability may be contingent upon the direction of selection, and that a detailed knowledge of trait evolutionary potential is needed to forecast population response to anthropogenic change.",

However, rigorous evaluation of the veracity of these tools in a different context from which they were developed has often lagged behind. Our goal was to perform one such critical test by examining how variation in tissue preparation and DNA isolation could affect inferences about gut microbiome variation between two genetically divergent lines of threespine stickleback fish maintained in the same lab environment. Using careful experimental design and intensive sampling of individuals, we addressed technical and biological sources of variation in 16S-based estimates of microbial diversity. After employing a two-tiered bead beating approach consisting of tissue homogenization followed by microbial lysis in subsamples, we found an extremely minor effect of DNA isolation protocol relative to among-host microbial diversity differences. Individual abundance estimates for rare OTUs, however, showed much lower reproducibility. We found that the stickleback gut microbiome was highly variable, even among siblings housed together, but that an effect of host genotype (stickleback lineage) was detectable for some microbial taxa. Our findings demonstrate the importance of appropriately quantifying biological and technical variance components when attempting to understand major influences on high-throughput microbiome data.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Up to 30-40% of Ewing sarcoma (EwS) patients with non-metastatic disease develop local or metastatic relapse within a time range of 2-10 years. This is in part caused by the absence of prognostic biomarkers that can identify high-risk patients to assign them to risk-adapted monitoring and treatment regimens. Since cancer stemness has been associated with tumor relapse and poor outcome, we investigated in the current study the prognostic potential SOX2 (sex determining region Y box 2) - a major transcription factor involved in development and stemness - previously described to contribute to the undifferentiated phenotype of EwS. Methods: Two independent patient cohorts, one consisting of 189 retrospectively collected EwS tumors with corresponding mRNA expression data (test cohort) and the other of 141 prospectively collected formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded resected tumors (validation cohort), were employed to analyze SOX2 expression levels by DNA microarrays or immunohistochemistry, respectively, and to compare them with clinical parameters and patient outcome. Two methods were employed to test the validity of the results at both mRNA and protein levels. Results: Both cohorts showed that only a subset of EwS patients (16-20%) express high SOX2 mRNA or protein levels, which significantly correlated with poor overall survival. Multivariate analyses of our validation cohort revealed that high SOX2 expression represents a major risk factor for survival (HR=3.19; P<0.01) that is independent from metastasis and other known clinical risk-factors at time of diagnosis. Univariate analysis demonstrated that SOX2-high expression correlated with tumor relapse (P=0.001). Median first relapse was at 14.7 months (range: 3.5-180.7). Conclusions: High SOX2 expression constitutes an independent prognostic biomarker for EwS patients with poor outcome, which may help to identify patients with localized disease who are at high risk for tumor relapse within the first two years after diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Ecogeographical rules that associate climate with organismal form and function can reveal patterns of climatic adaptation. Two rules link animal coloration with climate: Glogers rule (darker coloration where wet and warm), and Bogerts rule (darker coloration where cold). Whereas Glogers rule was proposed for endotherms, and Bogerts rule for ectotherms, both rules may apply more broadly, despite their seemingly opposing effects. Here we test this contradiction on a global scale across passerine birds. Consistent with Glogers rule, birds were darker in wetter areas and, following Bogerts rule, lighter where warm, although birds became lighter again at very low temperatures. Rainfall and temperature had antagonistic or additive effects depending on their pattern of covariation, and this predicted whether birds followed the rules. We integrate both rules into a general framework to explain heterogeneity in climatic effects on coloration, which has implications to understand patterns of diversification, climatic adaptation and climate change impacts.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMany recent phylogenetic methods have focused on accurately inferring species trees when there is gene tree discordance due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). For almost all of these methods, and for phylogenetic methods in general, the data for each locus is assumed to consist of orthologous, single-copy sequences. Loci that are present in more than a single copy in any of the studied genomes are excluded from the data. These steps greatly reduce the number of loci available for analysis. The question we seek to answer in this study is: What happens if one runs such species tree inference methods on data where paralogy is present, in addition to or without ILS being present? Through simulation studies and analyses of two large biological data sets, we show that running such methods on data with paralogs can still provide accurate results. We use multiple different methods, some of which are based directly on the multispecies coalescent (MSC) model, and some of which have been proven to be statistically consistent under it. We also treat the paralogous loci in multiple ways: from explicitly denoting them as paralogs, to randomly selecting one copy per species. In all cases the inferred species trees are as accurate as equivalent analyses using single-copy orthologs. Our results have significant implications for the use of ILS-aware phylogenomic analyses, demonstrating that they do not have to be restricted to single-copy loci. This will greatly increase the amount of data that can be used for phylogenetic inference.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin plasticity is thought to be fundamental to the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. Hmgn proteins modulate chromatin structure and are highly expressed during early development and in neural stem/progenitor cells of the developing and adult brain. Here, we show that loss of Hmgn1 or Hmgn2 in pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells leads to increased levels of spontaneous neuronal differentiation. This is accompanied by the loss of pluripotency markers and increased expression of the pro-neural transcription factors Neurog1 and Ascl1. Neural stem cells derived from these Hmgn-knockout lines also show increased spontaneous neuronal differentiation and Neurog1 expression. The loss of Hmgn2 is associated with the disruption of active chromatin states at specific classes of gene. The levels of H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac and H3K122ac are considerably reduced at the pluripotency genes Nanog and Oct4, which impacts transcription. At endodermal/mesodermal lineage-specific genes, the loss of Hmgn2 leads to a switch from a bivalent to a repressive chromatin configuration. However, at the neuronal lineage genes Neurog1 and Ascl1, no epigenetic changes are observed and their bivalent states are retained. We conclude that Hmgn proteins play important roles in maintaining chromatin plasticity in stem cells, and are essential for maintaining stem cell identity and pluripotency.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUsing canonical correlation analysis (CCA), hierarchical clustering, and machine learning methods, we recently identified four subtypes of depression defined by distinct patterns of abnormal functional connectivity in depression-related brain networks, which in turn predicted differing clinical symptom profiles and individual differences in treatment response. However, whether and how dysfunction in specific circuits may give rise to specific depressive symptoms and behaviors remains unclear. Furthermore, this approach assumes that there are robust and stable canonical correlations between functional connectivity and depressive symptoms--an assumption that was not extensively tested in our earlier work.\\n\\nMethodsFirst, we comprehensively re-evaluate the stability of canonical correlations between functional connectivity and symptoms, using optimized approaches for large-scale statistical testing, and we validate methods for improving stability. Next, we illustrate one approach to formulating hypotheses regarding subtype-specific circuit mechanisms driving depressive symptoms and behaviors and then testing them in animal models using optogenetic fMRI. We review recent work in this field and describe one example of this approach.\\n\\nResultsCorrelations between connectivity features and clinical symptoms are robustly significant, and CCA solutions tested repeatedly on held-out data generalize, but they are sensitive to data quality, preprocessing decisions, and clinical sample heterogeneity, which can reduce effect sizes. Generalization can be markedly improved by adding L2-regularization to CCA, which decreases variance, increases canonical correlations in left-out data, and stabilizes feature selection. This approach, in turn, can be used to identify candidate circuits for optogenetic interrogation in rodent models.\\n\\nConclusionsMulti-view approaches like CCA are a conceptually useful framework for discovering stable patient subtypes by synthesizing multiple clinical and functional measures. Optogenetic fMRI holds substantial promise for testing hypotheses regarding subtype-specific mechanisms driving specific symptoms and behaviors in depression.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal metastases are frequently accompanied by chronic pain that is mechanoceptive in nature and not easily managed by available therapies. The peripheral sensory profile of primary afferents responsible for transmitting the pain-related messages from cancerous bone to central sites is investigated here. We imaged thousands of primary sensory dorsal root ganglion neurons in vivo in healthy (sham-operated) and cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) rats in order to analyse and compare their function. Utilising Markov Cluster Analysis we identified distinct clusters of primary afferent responses to limb compression and position. In CIBP rats, three times as many sensory afferents responded to knee compression in the leg ipsilateral to the tumour compared to sham-operated rats. We present evidence that the observed increase in sensory afferent response was not due to increased individual afferent activity but rather represents activation of  silent nociceptors, whose origin we propose is largely from outside of the bone.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is rewiring the food webs that determine the fate of diverse ecosystems. Mobile generalist consumers are responding to climate change by rapidly shifting their behaviour and foraging, driving food webs to flex. Although these responsive generalists form a key stabilizing module in food web structure, the extent to which they are present throughout whole food webs is largely unknown. Here, we show that multiple species comprising key trophic roles drive flexible lake food webs with warming. By examining lakes that span a 7{degrees}C air temperature gradient, we found significant reductions in nearshore derived carbon and nearshore habitat use with increased temperature in three of four fish species. We also found evidence that the response of lake trout to increased temperatures may reduce their biomass and cascade to release their preferred prey, the pelagic forage fish cisco. Our results suggest that climate warming will shift lake food webs toward increased reliance on offshore habitats and resources. We argue that species across trophic levels broadly couple lake macrohabitats, suggesting that potentially stabilizing responsive consumers are present throughout food webs. However, climate change appears to limit their ability to responsively forage, critically undermining a repeated stabilizing mechanism in food webs.",

    "abstract": "Introns can increase gene expression levels using a variety of mechanisms collectively referred to as Intron Mediated Enhancement (IME). To date, the magnitude of IME has been quantified in human cell culture and plant models by comparing intronless reporter gene expression levels to those of intron-bearing reporter genes in vitro (mRNA, Western Blots, protein activity), using genome editing technologies that lacked full control of locus and copy number. Here, for the first time, we quantified IME in vivo, in terms of protein expression levels, using fluorescent reporter proteins expressed from a single, defined locus in Caenorhabditis elegans. To quantify the magnitude of IME, we developed a microfluidic chip-based workflow to mount and image individual animals, including software for operation and image processing. We used this workflow to systematically test the effects of position, number and sequence of introns on two different proteins, mCherry and mEGFP, driven by two different promoters, vit-2 and hsp-90. We found the three canonical synthetic introns commonly used in C. elegans transgenes increased mCherry protein concentration by approximately 50%. The naturally-occurring introns found in hsp-90 also increased mCherry expression level by about 50%. Furthermore, and consistent with prior results examining mRNA levels, protein activity or phenotypic rescue, we found that a single, natural or synthetic, 5 intron was sufficient for the full IME effect while a 3 intron was not. IME was also affected by protein coding sequence (50% for mCherry and 80% for mEGFP) but not strongly affected by promoter 46% for hsp-90 and 54% for the stronger vit-2. Our results show that IME of protein expression in C. elegans is affected by intron position and contextual coding sequence surrounding the introns, but not greatly by promoter strength. Our combined controlled transgenesis and microfluidic screening approach should facilitate screens for factors affecting IME and other intron-dependent processes.",

    "abstract": "We propose that humans spontaneously organize environments into clusters of states that support hierarchical planning, enabling them to tackle challenging problems by breaking them down into sub-problems at various levels of abstraction. People constantly rely on such hierarchical presentations to accomplish tasks big and small - from planning ones day, to organizing a wedding, to getting a PhD - often succeeding on the very first attempt. We formalize a Bayesian model of hierarchy discovery that explains how humans discover such useful abstractions. Building on principles developed in the robotics literature, the model predicts that hierarchy discovery should be sensitive to the topological structure, reward distribution, and distribution of tasks in the environment. In five simulations, we show that the model accounts for previously reported effects of environment structure on planning behavior, such as detection of bottleneck states and transitions. We then test the novel predictions of the model in seven behavioral experiments, demonstrating how the distribution of tasks and rewards can additionally influence planning behavior via the discovered hierarchy, sometimes facilitating and sometimes hindering performance. We also show that people use uncertainty to guide their learning in a way that is informative for hierarchy discovery. Finally, we propose how hierarchy discovery and hierarchical planning might be implemented in the brain. Together, these findings present an important advance in our understanding of how the brain might use Bayesian inference to uncover and exploit the hidden hierarchical structure of the world.",

This exceptional therapeutic efficacy presents a unique opportunity to identify the downstream molecular drivers of XLMTM pathology, and to what extent the whole muscle transcriptome is restored to normal after gene transfer. Herein, RNA-sequencing was used to examine the transcriptomes of the Biceps femoris and Vastus lateralis in a previously-described canine cohort showing dose-dependent clinical improvements after rAAV8-cMTM1 gene transfer. Our analysis confirmed several dysregulated genes previously observed in XLMTM mice, but also identified new transcripts linked to XLMTM pathology.

    "abstract": "Aggregates of the RNA binding protein TDP-43 are a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which are neurodegenerative disorders with overlapping clinical, genetic and pathological features. Mutations in the TDP-43 gene are causative of ALS, supporting its central role in pathogenesis. The process of TDP-43 aggregation remains poorly understood and whether this includes formation of intermediate complexes is unknown. We characterized aggregates derived from purified TDP-43 as a function of time and analyzed them under semi-denaturing conditions. Our assays identified oligomeric complexes at the initial time points prior to the formation of large aggregates, suggesting that ordered oligomerization is an intermediate step of TDP-43 aggregation. In addition, we analyzed liquid-liquid phase separation of TDP-43 and detected similar oligomeric assembly upon the maturation of liquid droplets into solid-like fibrils. These results strongly suggest that the oligomers form during the early steps of TDP-43 misfolding. Importantly, ALS-linked mutations A315T and M337V significantly accelerate aggregation, rapidly decreasing the monomeric population and shortening the oligomeric phase. We also show that the aggregates generated from purified protein seed intracellular aggregation, which is detected by established markers of TDP-43 pathology. Remarkably, cytoplasmic aggregate propagation is detected earlier with A315T and M337V and is 50% more widespread than with wild-type aggregates. Our findings provide evidence for a controlled process of TDP-43 self-assembly into intermediate structures that provide a scaffold for aggregation. This process is altered by ALS-linked mutations, underscoring the role of perturbations in TDP-43 homeostasis in protein aggregation and ALS-FTD pathogenesis.",
