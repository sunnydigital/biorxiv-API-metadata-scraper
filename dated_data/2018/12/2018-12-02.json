    "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax is the key obstacle to malaria elimination in Asia and Latin America, largely attributed to its ability to form resilient hypnozoites (sleeper-cells) in the host liver that escape treatment and cause relapsing infections. The decision to form hypnozoites is made early in the liver infection and may already be set in sporozoites prior to invasion. To better understand these early stages of infection, we undertook a comprehensive transcriptomic and histone epigenetic characterization of P. vivax sporozoites. The salivary-gland sporozoite transcriptome is heavily composed of transcripts associated with functions needed for early infection of the vertebrate host and development within hepatocytes. Through comparisons to recently published proteome data for the P. vivax sporozoite, our study finds that although highly transcribed, these transcripts are not detectable as proteins and may be regulated through translational repression; a finding we test for a small subset of transcripts and proteins through immunofluorescent microscopy of sporozoites and liver stages in humanized mice. We identify differential transcription between the sporozoite and published transcriptomes of asexual blood-stages and mixed versus hypnozoite-enriched liver stages. These comparisons point to multiple layers of transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational control that appear active in sporozoites and to a lesser extent hypnozoites, but largely absent in replicating liver schizonts or mixed blood-stages. Common transcripts up-regulated in sporozoites and hypnozoites compared to mixed (i.e., schizont) liver-stages identify genes linked to dormancy/persistence in bacteria, amoebae and plants. We also characterise histone epigenetic modifications in the P. vivax sporozoite and explore their role in regulating transcription. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that the sporozoite as a tightly programmed stage primed to infect the human host and identifies potential mechanisms for hypnozoite-formation that may be further explored in liver stage models.",

    "abstract": "Electronic health records and health insurance claims, providing observational data on millions of patients, offer great opportunities, and challenges, for population health studies. The objective of this study is identifying subpopulations that are likely to benefit from a given treatment using observational data. We refer to these subpopulations as \\\"better responders\\\" and focus on characterizing these using linear scores with a limited number of variables. Building upon well-established causal inference techniques for analyzing observational data, we propose two algorithms that generate such scores for identifying better responders, as well as methods for evaluating and comparing these scores. We applied our methodology to a large dataset of ~135,000 epilepsy patients derived from claims data. Out of this sample, 85,000 were used to characterize subpopulations with better response to next-generation (\\\"Newer\\\") anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), compared to an alternative treatment by first-generation (\\\"Older\\\") AEDs. The remaining 50,000 epilepsy patients were then used to evaluate our scores. Our results demonstrate the ability of our scores to identify large subpopulations of epilepsy patients with significantly better response to newer AEDs.",

    "abstract": "YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif) are downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway, they activate the expression of transcriptional targets that promote cell growth, cell proliferation, and prevent apoptosis. Here I examined the function of YAP/TAZ in mouse neocortex development through conditional deletion of Yap and Taz by Emx1-Cre. Loss of YAP/TAZ cause the hydrocephalus after birth, leads to aberrant development and dilated ventricle in adult stage, this phenotype can be detected as early as P0. YAP/TAZ are expressed in Sox2+ neural progenitor cells, when YAP/TAZ are deleted, the neuroepithelial cell junctions are disrupted; the numbers of Sox2+ cell and Tbr2+ cell are reduced and the ratio of tbr2/Sox2 is also reduced at E15.5. Results of cell cycle analyzing experiments display YAP/TAZ deletion increased the cell cycle exit. The improperly increased expression of Tuj1+ in progenitor cells in the YAP/TAZ deleted cortex indicates the premature of Sox2+ progenitor cells. Together, our results reveal that YAP/TAZ deletion changed the polarity of neuroepithelial cells, and increased the cell cycle exit, reduced the differentiation of Sox2+ cells into Tbr2+ cells through promoting the premature of Tuj1+ cells. These results define the functions of YAP/TAZ in keeping the cell polarity neural progenitors and ensuring their proliferation and differentiation, and also reveal the roles of YAP/TAZ in developing cortex.",

    "abstract": "Theory predicts that selfish genetic elements that increase their transmission are prone to originate on sex chromosomes but create strong selective pressure to evolve suppressors due to reduced fertility and distorted population sex ratios. Here we show that recurrent genetic conflict over sex chromosome transmission appears to be an important evolutionary force that has shaped gene content evolution of sex chromosomes in Drosophila. We demonstrate that convergent acquisition and amplification of spermatid expressed gene families are common on Drosophila sex chromosomes, and especially on recently formed ones, and harbor characteristics typical of meiotic drivers. We carefully characterize one putative novel cryptic sex chromosome distortion system that arose independently several times in members of the Drosophila obscura group. Co-amplification of the S-Lap1/GAPsec gene pair on both the X and the Y chromosome occurred independently several times in members of the D. obscura group, where this normally autosomal gene pair is sex-linked due to a sex chromosome - autosome fusion. Investigation of gene expression and short RNA profiles at the S-Lap1/GAPsec system suggest that meiotic drive and suppression likely involves RNAi mechanisms. Our finding suggests that recurrent conflict over sex chromosome transmission has shaped widespread genomic and evolutionary patterns, including the epigenetic regulation of sex chromosomes, the distribution of sex-biased genes, and the evolution of hybrid sterility.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A viruses evolve rapidly to escape host immunity, such that individuals can be infected multiple times with the same subtype. The form and duration of protective immunity after each influenza infection are poorly understood. Here, we quantify the dynamics of protective immunity against influenza A virus infections by fitting individual-level mechanistic models to longitudinal serology from children and adults in a household cohort study. We find that most protection in children is explained by antibody titers measured by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. In contrast, in adults, HI antibody titers explain a smaller fraction of protection. Protection against circulating strains wanes to approximately 50% of peak levels 3.5-7 years after infection in both age groups, and wanes faster against influenza A(H3N2) than A(H1N1)pdm09. Protection against H3N2 lasts longer in adults than in children. Our results suggest that the focus of influenza antibody responses changes over time from the highly mutable hemagglutinin head to other epitopes, consistent with the immunological theory of original antigenic sin, and that this change of focus might affect protection. Additionally, we estimate that imprinting, or primary infection with a subtype of one phylogenetic group, has little to no effect on the risk of non-medically attended influenza infections in adults. We also find no evidence of long-term cross-protection between subtypes. This work underscores the need for longitudinal data on multiple components of the immune response to better understand the development of immunity and differences in susceptibility within populations.",

    "abstract": "Many neurons in the brain, such as place cells in the rodent hippocampus, have localized receptive fields, i.e., they respond to a small neighborhood of stimulus space. What is the functional significance of such representations and how can they arise? Here, we propose that localized receptive fields emerge in similarity-preserving networks of rectifying neurons that learn low-dimensional manifolds populated by sensory inputs. Numerical simulations of such networks on standard datasets yield manifold-tiling localized receptive fields. More generally, we show analytically that, for data lying on symmetric manifolds, optimal solutions of objectives, from which similarity-preserving networks are derived, have localized receptive fields. Therefore, nonnegative similarity-preserving mapping (NSM) implemented by neural networks can model representations of continuous manifolds in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Modern optical imaging experiments not only measure single-cell and single-molecule dynamics with high precision, but they can also perturb the cellular environment in myriad controlled and novel settings. Techniques, such as single-molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization, microfluidics, and optogenetics, have opened the door to a large number of potential experiments, which begs the question of how best to choose the best possible experiment. The Fisher information matrix (FIM) estimates how well potential experiments will constrain model parameters and can be used to design optimal experiments. Here, we introduce the finite state projection (FSP) based FIM, which uses the formalism of the chemical master equation to derive and compute the FIM. The FSP-FIM makes no assumptions about the distribution shapes of single-cell data, and it does not require precise measurements of higher order moments of such distributions. We validate the FSP-FIM against well-known Fisher information results for the simple case of constitutive gene expression. We then use numerical simulations to demonstrate the use of the FSP-FIM to optimize the timing of single-cell experiments with more complex, non-Gaussian fluctuations. We validate optimal simulated experiments determined using the FSP-FIM with Monte-Carlo approaches and contrast these to experiment designs chosen by traditional analyses that assume Gaussian fluctuations or use the central limit theorem. By systematically designing experiments to use all of the measurable fluctuations, our method enables a key step to improve co-design of experiments and quantitative models.\\n\\nAuthor summaryA main objective of quantitative modeling is to predict the behaviors of complex systems under varying conditions. In a biological context, stochastic fluctuations in expression levels among isogenic cell populations have required modeling efforts to incorporate and even rely upon stochasticity. At the same time, new experimental variables such as chemical induction and optogenetic control have created vast opportunities to probe and understand gene expression, even at single-molecule and single-cell precision. With many possible measurements or perturbations to choose from, researchers require sophisticated approaches to choose which experiment to perform next. In this work, we provide a new tool, the finite state projection based Fisher information matrix (FSP-FIM), which considers all cell-to-cell fluctuations measured in modern data sets, and can design optimal experiments under these conditions. Unlike previous approaches, the FSP-FIM does not make any assumptions about the shape of the distribution being measured. This new tool will allow experimentalists to optimally perturb systems to learn as much as possible about single-cell processes with a minimum of experimental cost or effort.",

In this paper, venom composition of several related mammal-eating species was compared using shotgun proteomics.\\n\\nResultsVenom of Oxyuranus temporalis consisted predominately of -neurotoxins (three-finger toxin family) and was deficient in phospholipase A2 neurotoxins. In contrast, PLA2 neurotoxins (taipoxin and paradoxin) were abundant in the venoms of other mammal-eating taipan species - Oxyuranus scutellatus and O. microlepidotus. Variation in neurotoxic PLA2 expression was also recorded in mammal-eating brown snakes, some species having high venom levels of textilotoxin or related homologues, for example Pseudonaja textilis and P. nuchalis, and others, such as P. ingrami, lacking them. Venom prothrombinase proteins (fX and fV) were expressed in most mammalivorous lineages, being particularly abundant in some Pseudonaja species. Notably, Oxyuranus temporalis venom was deficient in venom prothrombinase despite a mammal-based diet. Expression of an -neurotoxin that is lethal to rodents (pseudonajatoxin b) was profoundly down-regulated in Pseudonaja textilis venom sample from Queensland and highly up-regulated in the sample from South Australia despite a report that the snake feeds on rodents in both regions.\\n\\nConclusionRelated species of taipans and brown snakes that feed on small mammals express different sets of venom proteins toxic to this vertebrate group.

    "abstract": "Posttraumatic headache (PTH) is one of the most common, debilitating and difficult symptoms to manage after a traumatic head injury. While the mechanisms underlying PTH remain elusive, recent studies in rodent models suggest the potential involvement of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a mediator of neurogenic inflammation, and the ensuing activation of meningeal mast cells (MCs), pro-algesic resident immune cells that can lead to the activation of the headache pain pathway. Here, we investigated the relative contribution of MCs to the development of PTH-like pain behaviors in a model of mild closed head injury (mCHI) in male rats. We initially tested the relative contribution of peripheral CGRP signaling to the activation of meningeal MCs following mCHI using an anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody. We then employed a prophylactic MC granule depletion approach to address the hypotheses that intact meningeal MC granule content is necessary for the development of PTH-related pain-like behaviors. The data suggest that following mCHI, ongoing activation of meningeal MCs is not mediated by peripheral CGRP signaling, and does not contribute to development of the mCHI-evoked cephalic mechanical pain hypersensitivity. Our data, however, also reveals that the development of latent sensitization, manifested as persistent hypersensitivity upon the recovery from mCHI-evoked acute cranial hyperalgesia to the headache trigger glyceryl trinitrate requires intact MC content during and immediately after mCHI. Collectively, our data implicate the acute activation of meningeal MCs as mediator of chronic pain hypersensitivity following a concussion or mCHI. Targeting MCs may be explored for early prophylactic treatment of PTH.",

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) impact plant growth and are a major driver of plant diversity and productivity. We quantified the contribution of intra-specific genetic variability in cassava (Manihot esculenta) and Rhizophagus irregularis to gene reprogramming in symbioses using dual RNA-sequencing. A large number of cassava genes exhibited altered transcriptional responses to the fungus but transcription of most of these plant genes (72%) responded in a different direction or magnitude depending on the plant genotype. Two AMF isolates displayed large differences in their transcription, but the direction and magnitude of the transcriptional responses for a large number of these genes was also strongly influenced by the genotype of the plant host. This indicates that unlike the highly conserved plant genes necessary for the symbiosis establishment, plant and fungal gene transcriptional responses are not conserved and are greatly influenced by plant and fungal genetic differences, even at the within-species level. The transcriptional variability detected allowed us to identify an extensive gene network showing the interplay in plant-fungal reprogramming in the symbiosis. Key genes illustrated that the two organisms jointly program their cytoskeleton organisation during growth of the fungus inside roots. Our study reveals that plant and fungal genetic variation plays a strong role in shaping the genetic reprograming in response to symbiosis, indicating considerable genotype x genotype interactions in the mycorrhizal symbiosis. Such variation needs to be considered in order to understand the molecular mechanisms between AMF and their plant hosts in natural communities.",

    "abstract": "Most eukaryotic genes comprise exons and introns thus requiring the precise removal of introns from pre-mRNAs to enable protein biosynthesis. U2 and U12 spliceosomes catalyze this step by recognizing motifs on the transcript in order to remove the introns. A process which is dependent on precise definition of exon-intron borders by splice sites, which are consequently highly conserved across species. Only very few combinations of terminal dinucleotides are frequently observed at intron ends, dominated by the canonical GT-AG splice sites on the DNA level.\\n\\nHere we investigate the occurrence of diverse combinations of dinucleotides at predicted splice sites. Analyzing 121 plant genome sequences based on their annotation revealed strong splice site conservation across species, annotation errors, and true biological divergence from canonical splice sites. The frequency of non-canonical splice sites clearly correlates with their divergence from canonical ones indicating either an accumulation of probably neutral mutations, or evolution towards canonical splice sites. Strong conservation across multiple species and non-random accumulation of substitutions in splice sites indicate a functional relevance of non-canonical splice sites. The average composition of splice sites across all investigated species is 98.7% for GT-AG, 1.2% for GC-AG, 0.06% for AT-AC, and 0.09% for minor non-canonical splice sites. RNA-Seq data sets of 35 species were incorporated to validate non-canonical splice site predictions through gaps in sequencing reads alignments and to demonstrate the expression of affected genes.

    "abstract": "Forest models often reflect the dominant management paradigm of their time. Until the late 1970s, this meant sustaining yields. Following landmark work in forest ecology, physiology, and biogeochemistry, the current generation of models is further intended to inform ecological and climatic forest management in alignment with national biodiversity and climate mitigation targets. This has greatly increased the complexity of models used to inform management, making them difficult to diagnose and understand. State-of-the-art forest models are often complex, analytically intractable, and computationally-expensive, due to the explicit representation of detailed biogeochemical and ecological processes. Different models often produce distinct results while predictions from the same model vary with parameter values. In this project, we developed a rigorous quantitative approach for conducting model intercomparisons and assessing model performance. We have applied our original methodology to compare two forest biogeochemistry models, the Perfect Plasticity Approximation with Simple Biogeochemistry (PPA-SiBGC) and Landscape Disturbance and Succession with Net Ecosystem Carbon and Nitrogen (LANDIS-II NECN). We simulated past-decade conditions at flux tower sites located within Harvard Forest, MA, USA (HF-EMS) and Jones Ecological Research Center, GA, USA (JERC-RD). We mined field data available for both sites to perform model parameterization, validation, and intercomparison. We assessed model performance using the following time-series metrics: net ecosystem exchange, aboveground net primary production, aboveground biomass, C, and N, belowground biomass, C, and N, soil respiration, and, species total biomass and relative abundance. We also assessed static observations of soil organic C and N, and concluded with an assessment of general model usability, performance, and transferability. Despite substantial differences in design, both models achieved good accuracy across the range of pool metrics. While LANDIS-II NECN showed better fidelity to interannual NEE fluxes, PPA-SiBGC indicated better overall performance for both sites across the 11 temporal and 2 static metrics tested (HF-EMS [Formula] = 0.73, +0.07, [Formula] = 4.84, -10.02; JERC-RD [Formula] = 0.76, +0.04, [Formula] = 2.69, -1.86). To facilitate further testing of forest models at the two sites, we provide pre-processed datasets and original software written in the R language of statistical computing. In addition to model intercomparisons, our approach may be employed to test modifications to forest models and their sensitivity to different parameterizations.",

The CRISPR/Cas9 technology is now delivering novel genetic models for fundamental research, drug screening, therapy development, rapid diagnostics and transcriptional modulation. Despite the apparent simplicity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, the outcome of a genome editing experiment can be substantially impacted by technical parameters as well as biological considerations. Here, we present guidelines and tools to optimize CRISPR/Cas9 genome targeting efficiency and specificity. The nature of the target locus, the design of the single guide RNA and the choice of the delivery method should all be carefully considered prior to a genome editing experiment.

    "abstract": "Somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) are a hallmark of cancer. Although CNA profiles have been established for most human tumor types, their precise role in tumorigenesis as well as their clinical and therapeutic relevance remain largely unclear. Thus, computational and statistical approaches are required to thoroughly define the interplay between CNAs and tumor phenotypes. Here we developed CNApp, a user-friendly web tool that offers sample- and cohort-level computational analyses, allowing a comprehensive and integrative exploration of CNAs with clinical and molecular variables. By using purity-corrected segmented data from multiple genomic platforms, CNApp generates genome-wide profiles, computes CNA scores for broad, focal and global CNA burdens, and uses machine learning-based predictions to classify samples. We applied CNApp to a pan-cancer dataset of 10,635 genomes from TCGA showing that CNA patterns classify cancer types according to their tissue-of-origin, and that broad and focal CNA scores positively correlate in samples with low amounts of whole-chromosome and chromosomal arm-level imbalances. Moreover, using the hepatocellular carcinoma cohort from the TCGA repository, we demonstrate the reliability of the tool in identifying recurrent CNAs, confirming previous results. Finally, we establish machine learning-based models to predict colon cancer molecular subtypes and microsatellite instability based on broad CNA scores and specific genomic imbalances. In summary, CNApp facilitates data-driven research and provides a unique framework for the first time to comprehensively assess CNAs and perform integrative analyses that enable the identification of relevant clinical implications.

    "abstract": "The embryonic diencephalon gives rise to diverse neuronal cell types, which form complex integration centers and intricate relay stations of the vertebrate forebrain. Prior anecdotal gene expression studies suggest several developmental compartments within the developing diencephalon. In the current study, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing to profile transcriptomes of dissociated cells from the diencephalon of E12.5 mouse embryos. Through analysis of unbiased transcriptional data, we identified the divergence of different progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and emerging neuronal cell types. After mapping the identified cell groups to their spatial origins, we were able to characterize the molecular features across different cell types and cell states, arising from various diencephalic compartments. Furthermore, we reconstructed the developmental trajectory of different cell lineages within the diencephalon. This allowed the identification of the genetic cascades and gene regulatory networks underlying the progression of the cell cycle, neurogenesis, and cellular diversification. The analysis provides new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the specification and amplification of thalamic progenitor cells. In addition, the single-cell-resolved trajectories not only confirm a close relationship between the rostral thalamus and prethalamus, but also uncover an unexpected close relationship between the caudal thalamus, epithalamus and rostral pretectum. Our data provide a useful resource for the systematic study of cell heterogeneity and differentiation kinetics within the developing diencephalon.",

    "abstract": "Virus-host interactions are frequently studied in bulk cell populations, obscuring cell-to-cell variation. Here we investigate endogenous herpesvirus gene expression at the single-cell level, combining a sensitive and robust fluorescent in situ hybridization platform with multiparameter flow cytometry, to study the expression of gammaherpesvirus non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) during lytic replication, latent infection and reactivation in vitro. This method allowed robust detection of viral ncRNAs of murine gammaherpesvirus 68 ({gamma}HV68), Kaposis sarcoma associated herpesvirus and Epstein-Barr virus, revealing variable expression at the single-cell level. By quantifying the inter-relationship of viral ncRNA, viral mRNA, viral protein and host mRNA regulation during {gamma}HV68 infection, we find heterogeneous and asynchronous gene expression during latency and reactivation, with reactivation from latency identified by a distinct gene expression profile within rare cells. Further, during lytic replication with {gamma}HV68, we find many cells have limited viral gene expression, with only a fraction of cells showing robust gene expression, dynamic RNA localization, and progressive infection. These findings, powered by single-cell analysis integrated with automated clustering algorithms, suggest inefficient or abortive {gamma}HV infection in many cells, and identify substantial heterogeneity in viral gene expression at the single-cell level.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARY\\n\\nThe gammaherpesviruses are a group of DNA tumor viruses that establish lifelong infection. How these viruses infect and manipulate cells has frequently been studied in bulk populations of cells. While these studies have been incredibly insightful, there is limited understanding of how virus infection proceeds within a single cell. Here we present a new approach to quantify gammaherpesvirus gene expression at the single-cell level. This method allows us to detect cell-to-cell variation in the expression of virus non-coding RNAs, an important and understudied class of RNAs which do not encode for proteins. By examining multiple features of virus gene expression, this method further reveals significant variation in infection between cells across multiple stages of infection. These studies emphasize that gammaherpesvirus infection can be surprisingly heterogeneous when viewed at the level of the individual cell. Because this approach can be broadly applied across diverse viruses, this study affords new opportunities to understand the complexity of virus infection within single cells.",

    "abstract": "There are a number of diseases characterized by the presence of neutrophil elastase (NE) activity in tissues including cystic fibrosis and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency induced lung destruction. It is generally accepted that NE actively contributes to this pathological process, but the precise mechanisms has yet to be determined. We hypothesized that NE activates the macrophages (M{square}) pro-inflammatory program. We demonstrate that following NE exposure, monocyte-derived M{square} release proteolytic activity composed of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which could contribute to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. NE upregulates expression of M{square} derived pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL-1{beta}, and IL-8. Thus, NE-activated M{square} can contribute to tissue destruction through the proteolytic activity of metalloproteinases and by supporting chronic inflammation through expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We also demonstrate that NE increases M{square} adhesion that is attenuated by antibodies specific to integrin subunits. We show that the effects of NE on M{square} can be mediated through an activation of integrin pathways. In support of integrin involvement, we demonstrate that NE activates the Src kinase family, a hallmark of integrin signaling activation. Moreover, pretreatment of macrophages with a specific Src kinase inhibitor, PP2, completely prevents NE-induced inflammatory cytokine production. Taken together these findings indicate that NE has effect on lung destruction that extends beyond direct proteolytic degradation of matrix proteins.",

    "abstract": "Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a rare developmental disorder caused by mutations in genes related to the cohesin complex. For its association with chromatin, cohesin depends on a heterodimer formed by NIPBL and MAU2, which interact via their respective N-termini. Variants in NIPBL are the main cause of CdLS and result in NIPBL haploinsufficiency.\\n\\nUsing CRISPR, we generated cells homozygous for an out-of-frame duplication in NIPBL. Remarkably, alternative translation initiation rescued NIPBL expression in these cells and produced an N-terminally truncated NIPBL that lacks MAU2-interaction domain, causing a dramatic reduction of MAU2 protein levels. Strikingly, this protective mechanism allows nearly normal amounts of cohesin to be loaded onto chromatin in a manner that is independent of functional NIPBL/MAU2 complexes and therefore in contrast to previous findings.\\n\\nWe also report the first pathogenic variant in MAU2, a deletion of seven amino acids important for wrapping the N-terminus of NIPBL within MAU2. The mutation causes dramatic reduction of MAU2 heterodimerization with NIPBL, hence undermining the stability of both proteins.\\n\\nOur data confirm NIPBL haploinsufficiency as the major pathogenic mechanism of CdLS and give new insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for this neurodevelopmental disorder. Our work also unveils an alternative translation-based mechanism that protects cells from out-of-frame variants of NIPBL and that may be of relevance in other genetic conditions.",

    "abstract": "In the progression of cancer, cells acquire genetic mutations that cause uncontrolled growth. Over time, the primary tumour may undergo additional mutations that allow for the cancerous cells to spread throughout the body as metastases. Since metastatic development typically results in markedly worse patient outcomes, research into the identity and function of metastasisassociated biomarkers could eventually translate into clinical diagnostics or novel therapeutics. Although the general processes underpinning metastatic progression are understood, no consistent nor clear cross-cancer biomarker profile has yet emerged. However, the literature suggests that some microRNAs (miRNAs) may play an important role in the metastatic progression of several cancer types. Using a subset of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, we performed an integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression with paired metastatic and primary tumour samples to interrogate how the miRNA-mRNA regulatory axis influences metastatic progression. From this, we successfully built mRNAand miRNA-specific classifiers that can discriminate pairs of metastatic and primary samples across 11 cancer types. In addition, we identified a number of miRNAs whose metastasis-associated dysregulation could predict mRNA metastasis-associated dysregulation. Among the most predictive miRNAs, we found several previously implicated in cancer progression, including miR-301b, miR-1296, and miR-423. Taken together, our results suggest that cross-cancer metastatic samples have unique biomarker signatures when compared with paired primary tumours, and that these miRNA biomarkers can be used to predict both metastatic status and mRNA expression.",

Urine, which lacks homeostatic mechanisms, is an ideal biomarker source that accumulates early and highly sensitive changes to provides information about the early stage of disease. A rat model mimicking the local tumor growth process in the brain was established with intracerebral Walker 256 (W256) cell injection. Urine samples were collected on days 3, 5 and 8 after injection and then analyzed by LC-MS/MS. In the intracerebral W256 model, no obvious clinical manifestations changes or abnormal MRI signals were found on days 3 and 5; at these time points, nine proteins were changed significantly in the urine of all 8 tumor rats. On day 8, when tumors were detected by MRI, twenty-five differential proteins were identified, including 10 proteins that have been reported to be closely related to tumor metastasis or brain tumors. The differential urinary proteomes were compared with those from the subcutaneous W256 model and the intracerebral C6 model. Few differential proteins overlapped. Specific differential protein patterns were observed among the three models, indicating that the urinary proteome can reflect the difference when tumor cells with different growth characteristics are inoculated into the brain and when identical tumor cells are inoculated into different areas, specifically, the subcutis and the brain.",

Here we harness human cortical brain organoids to probe, at single cell resolution, the longitudinal impact of GSK3 inhibition through multiple developmental stages. Our results indicate that chronic GSK3 inhibition increases the proliferation of neural progenitors and causes massive derangement of cortical tissue architecture. Surprisingly, single cell transcriptome profiling revealed only a discrete impact on early neurogenesis and uncovered the outer radial glia and the astrogenic lineage as the main GSK3-dependent developmental domains. Through this first single cell-level dissection of the GSK3 regulatory network in human corticogenesis, our work uncovers a remarkably specific conduit between the architecture of progenitor niches and lineage specification.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal regeneration after injury depends on the intrinsic growth potential of neurons. UNC-16, a C. elegans JIP3 homologue, inhibits axonal regeneration by regulating regrowth initiation and rate of regrowth. UNC-16/JIP3 inhibits the regeneration promoting activity of DLK-1 long but acts additively to and independently of inhibitory DLK-1 short isoform. UNC-16/JIP3 promotes DLK-1 punctate localization in a concentration dependent manner limiting DLK-1 long availability at the cut site minutes after injury. UNC-16 negatively regulates actin dynamics dependent on DLK-1 and microtubule dynamics independent of DLK-1. The faster regeneration seen in unc-16 does not lead to functional recovery. We propose a model where UNC-16/JIP3 plays its inhibitory role through tight temporal and spatial control of DLK-1 function. The dual inhibitory control by both UNC-16 and DLK-1 short calibrate the intrinsic growth promoting function of DLK-1 long in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The accurate prediction of protein stability upon sequence mutation is an important but unsolved challenge in protein engineering. Large mutational datasets are required to train computational predictors, but traditional methods for collecting stability data are either low-throughput or measure protein stability indirectly. Here, we develop an automated method to generate thermodynamic stability data for nearly every single mutant in a small 56-residue protein. Analysis reveals that most single mutants have a neutral effect on stability, mutational sensitivity is largely governed by residue burial, and unexpectedly, hydrophobics are the best tolerated amino acid type. Correlating the output of various stability prediction algorithms against our data shows that nearly all perform better on boundary and surface positions than for those in the core, and are better at predicting large to small mutations than small to large ones. We show that the most stable variants in the single mutant landscape are better identified using combinations of two prediction algorithms, and that including more algorithms can provide diminishing returns. In most cases, poor in silico predictions were tied to compositional differences between the data being analyzed and the datasets used to train the algorithm. Finally, we find that strategies to extract stabilities from high-throughput fitness data such as deep mutational scanning are promising and that data produced by these methods may be applicable toward training future stability prediction tools.\n\nSignificance StatementUsing liquid-handling automation, we constructed and measured the thermodynamic stability of almost every single mutant of protein G (G{beta}1), a small domain. This self-consistent dataset is the largest of its kind and offers unique opportunities on two fronts: (i) insight into protein domain properties such as positional sensitivity and incorporated amino acid tolerance, and (ii) service as a validation set for future efforts in protein stability prediction. As G{beta}1 is a model system for protein folding and design, and its single mutant landscape has been measured by deep mutational scanning, we expect our dataset to serve as a reference for studies aimed at extracting stability information from fitness data or developing novel high-throughput stability assays.",

    "abstract": "Resistant tumours are thought to arise from the action of Darwinian selection on genetically heterogenous cancer cell populations. However, simple clonal selection is inadequate to describe the late relapses often characterising luminal breast cancers treated with endocrine therapy (ET), suggesting a more complex interplay between genetic and non-genetic factors. Partially, this is due to our limited understanding on the effect of ET at the single cell level. In the present study, we dissect the contributions of clonal genetic diversity and transcriptional plasticity during the early and late phases of ET at single-cell resolution. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing and imaging we disentangle the transcriptional variability of plastic cells and define a rare sub-population of pre-adapted (PA) cells which undergoes further transcriptomic reprogramming and copy number changes to acquire full resistance. PA cells show reduced oestrogen receptor  activity but increased features of quiescence and migration. We find evidence for sub-clonal expression of this PA signature in primary tumours and for dominant expression in clustered circulating tumour cells. We propose a multi-step model for ET resistance development and advocate the use of stage-specific biomarkers.",

It is not known how CX neuronal diversity is generated or how developmental origin of subtypes relates to function. We mapped the developmental origin of four key CX subtypes and found that neurons with similar origin have matching axon/dendrite targeting. Moreover, we found that the temporal transcription factor (TTF) Eyeless/Pax6 regulates the development of two recurrently-connected CX subtypes: Eyeless loss simultaneously produces ectopic P-EN neurons with normal axon/dendrite projections, and reduces the number of E-PG neurons. Furthermore, the transient loss of Eyeless during development impairs adult flies capacity to perform celestial navigation. We conclude that neurons with similar developmental origin have similar connectivity, that Eyeless maintains equal E-PG and P-EN neuron number, and that Eyeless is required for the development of circuits that control adult navigation.",

    "abstract": "Recently, it was shown that anterior-posterior patterning genes in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum are expressed sequentially in waves. However, in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, an insect with a derived mode of embryogenesis compared to Tribolium, anterior-posterior patterning genes quickly and simultaneously arise as mature gene expression domains that, afterwards, undergo slight posterior-to-anterior shifts. This raises the question of how a fast and simultaneous mode of patterning, like that of Drosophila, could have evolved from a rather slow sequential mode of patterning, like that of Tribolium. In this paper, we elucidate a mechanism for this evolutionary transition based on a switch from a uniform to a gradient-mediated initialization of the gap gene cascade by maternal Hb. The model is supported by computational analyses and experiments.",

We used Targeted DamID (TaDa) to identify the genomic binding sites of the temporal transcription factor Hunchback in two adjacent Drosophila neuroblasts (NB5-6 and NB7-4). Hunchback targets were different in each neuroblast. Profiling chromatin accessibility showed that each neuroblast had a distinct chromatin landscape: Hunchback-bound loci in NB5-6 were in open chromatin, but the same loci in NB7-4 were in closed chromatin. Moreover, binding of the spatial factor Gsb/Pax3, essential for NB5-6 specification, was correlated with open chromatin and Hunchback-enriched loci in NB5-6, but not NB7-4. We propose early-acting spatial factors establish a unique chromatin landscape in each neuroblast, thereby restricting temporal factor binding to different loci in each neuroblast, resulting in different neurons in each neuroblast lineage.\\n\\nImpact statementIntegration of spatial and temporal identity during Drosophila neurogenesis is due to spatial factors generating neuroblast-specific chromatin thereby biasing subsequent temporal transcription factor binding and producing neuroblast-specific neurons.",

While studies have shown that smoking alters bronchial epithelial function and morphology, the precise effects of this exposure on specific cell types are not well-understood. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile bronchial epithelial cells from six never- and six current smokers. Unsupervised analyses identified thirteen cell clusters defined by unique combinations of nineteen distinct gene sets. Expression of a set of toxin metabolism genes localized to ciliated cells from smokers. Smoking-induced airway remodeling was characterized by a loss of club cells and extensive goblet cell hyperplasia. Finally, we identified a novel peri-goblet epithelial subpopulation in smokers that expressed a marker of bronchial premalignant lesions. Our data demonstrates that smoke exposure drives a complex landscape of cellular and molecular alterations in the human bronchial epithelium that may contribute to the onset of smoking-associated lung diseases.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin modifiers act to coordinate gene expression changes critical to neuronal differentiation from neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) encodes a histone methyltransferase that promotes transcriptional activation, and is frequently mutated in cancers and in the majority (>70%) of patients diagnosed with the congenital, multisystem intellectual disability (ID) disorder Kabuki syndrome 1 (KS1). Critical roles for KMT2D are established in various non-neural tissues, but the effects of KMT2D loss in brain cell development have not been described. We conducted parallel studies of proliferation, differentiation, transcription, and chromatin profiling in KMT2D-deficient human and mouse models to define KMT2D-regulated functions in neurodevelopmental contexts, including adult-born hippocampal NSPCs in vivo and in vitro. We report cell-autonomous defects in proliferation, cell cycle, and survival, accompanied by early NSPC maturation in several KMT2D-deficient model systems. Transcriptional suppression in KMT2D-deficient cells indicated strong perturbation of hypoxia-responsive metabolism pathways. Functional experiments confirmed abnormalities of cellular hypoxia responses in KMT2D-deficient neural cells, and accelerated NSPC maturation in vivo. Together, our findings support a model in which loss of KMT2D function suppresses expression of oxygen-responsive gene programs important to neural progenitor maintenance, resulting in precocious neuronal differentiation in a mouse model of KS1.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=91 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/484410v3_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (22K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@55dd1aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1270c80org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a5bda2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@144df37_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

These proteins have recently been shown to localise to the base of the connecting cilium of the retinal photoreceptor cells, elucidating this form of RP as a retinal ciliopathy. In the case of loss-of-function variants in these genes, pathogenicity can easily be ascribed. In the case of missense variants, this is more challenging. Furthermore, the exact molecular mechanism of disease in this form of RP remains poorly understood.\\n\\nIn this paper we take advantage of the recently published cryo EM-resolved structure of the entire human spliceosome, to predict the effect of a novel missense variant in one component of the spliceosome; PRPF31, found in a patient attending the genetics eye clinic at Bristol Eye Hospital. Monoallelic variants in PRPF31 are a common cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) with incomplete penetrance. We use in vitro studies to confirm pathogenicity of this novel variant PRPF31 c.341T>A, p.Ile114Asn.\\n\\nThis work demonstrates how in silico modelling of structural effects of missense variants on cryo-EM resolved protein complexes can contribute to predicting pathogenicity of novel variants, in combination with in vitro and clinical studies.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe hormonal contraceptive Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) is associated with increased risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), via incompletely understood mechanisms. Increased diversity in the vaginal microbiota modulates genital inflammation and is associated with increased HIV-1 acquisition. However, the effect of MPA on diversity of the vaginal microbiota is relatively unknown. In a cohort of female Kenyan sex workers, negative for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with Nugent Scores <7 (N=58 of 370 screened), MPA correlated with significantly increased diversity of the vaginal microbiota as assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. MPA was also significantly associated with low vaginal glycogen and -amylase, factors implicated in vaginal colonization by lactobacilli, bacteria believed to protect against STIs. Furthermore, increased diversity of the vaginal microbiota correlated with activation of vaginal HIV-1 target cells. Results were recapitulated in humanized mice where MPA treatment was associated with increased diversity of the vaginal microbiota, low glycogen, and enhanced HIV-1 susceptibility. Together these results suggest MPA-induced hypo-estrogenism may alter key metabolic components necessary for vaginal colonization by certain bacterial species including lactobacilli, and allow for greater bacterial diversity in the vaginal microbiota. Bacterial diversity in the vaginal microbiota correlates with activation of HIV-1 target cells, which might thus contribute to enhanced susceptibility to HIV-1.",

    "abstract": "Monocular deprivation (MD) during the juvenile critical period leads to long-lasting impairments in binocular function and visual acuity. The site of these changes has been widely considered to be cortical. However, recent evidence indicates that binocular integration may first occur in the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (dLGN), raising the question of whether MD during the critical period may produce long-lasting deficits in dLGN binocular integration. Using in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging of dLGN afferents and excitatory neurons in superficial layers of primary visual cortex (V1), we demonstrate that critical-period MD leads to a persistent and selective loss of binocular dLGN inputs, while leaving spatial acuity in the thalamocortical pathway intact. Despite being few in number, binocular dLGN boutons display remarkably robust visual responses, on average twice stronger than monocular boutons, and their responses are exquisitely well-matched between the eyes. To our surprise, we found that MD leads to a profound binocular mismatch of response amplitude, spatial frequency and orientation tuning detected at the level of single thalamocortical synapses. In comparison, V1 neurons display deficits in both binocular integration and spatial acuity following MD. Our data provide the most compelling evidence to date demonstrating that following critical-period MD, binocular deficits observed at the level of V1 may at least in part originate from dLGN binocular dysfunction, while spatial acuity deficits arise from cortical circuits. These findings highlight a hitherto unknown role of the thalamus as a site for developmental refinement of binocular vision.",

    "abstract": "Tracking SLO systems equipped to perform retinally targeted stimulus delivery typically use near-IR wavelengths for retinal imaging and eye tracking and visible wavelengths for stimulation. The lateral offsets between wavelengths caused by transverse chromatic aberration (TCA) must be carefully corrected in order to deliver targeted stimuli to the correct location on the retina. However, both the magnitude and direction of the TCA offset is dependent on the position of the eyes pupil relative to the incoming beam, and thus can change dynamically within an experimental session without proper control of the pupil position. The goals of this study were twofold: 1) To assess sources of variability in TCA alignments as a function of pupil displacements in an SLO and 2) To demonstrate a novel method for real-time correction of chromatic offsets. To summarize, we found substantial between- and within-subject variability in TCA in the presence of monochromatic aberrations. When adaptive optics was used to fully correct for monochromatic aberrations, variability both within and between observers was minimized. In a second experiment, we demonstrate that pupil tracking can be used to update stimulus delivery in the SLO in real time to correct for variability in chromatic offsets with pupil displacements.",
