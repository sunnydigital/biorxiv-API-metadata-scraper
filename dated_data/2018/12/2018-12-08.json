    "abstract": "Sister chromatid cohesion on chromosome arms is essential for the segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I while it is dispensable for sister chromatid separation during mitosis. It was assumed that, unlike the situation in mitosis, chromosome arms retain cohesion prior to onset of anaphase-I. Paradoxically, reduced immunostaining signals of meiosis-specific cohesin, including the kleisin Rec8, from the chromosomes were observed during late prophase-I of budding yeast. This decrease is seen in the absence of Rec8 cleavage and depends on condensin-mediated recruitment of Polo-like kinase (PLK/Cdc5). In this study, we confirmed that this release indeed accompanies the dissociation of acetylated Smc3 as well as Rec8 from meiotic chromosomes during late prophase-I. This release requires, in addition to PLK, the cohesin regulator, Wapl (Rad61/Wpl1 in yeast), and Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase (DDK). Meiosis-specific phosphorylation of Rad61/Wpl1 and Rec8 by PLK and DDK collaboratively promote this release. This process is similar to the vertebrate \\\"prophase\\\" pathway for cohesin release during G2 phase and pro-metaphase. In yeast, meiotic cohesin release coincides with PLK-dependent compaction of chromosomes in late meiotic prophase-I. We suggest that yeast uses this highly regulated cleavage-independent pathway to remove cohesin during late prophase-I to facilitate morphogenesis of condensed metaphase-I chromosomes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn meiosis the life and health of future generations is decided upon. Any failure in chromosome segregation has a detrimental impact. Therefore, it is currently believed that the physical connections between homologous chromosomes are maintained by meiotic cohesin with exceptional stability. Indeed, it was shown that cohesive cohesin does not show an appreciable turnover during long periods in oocyte development. In this context, it was long assumed but not properly investigated, that the prophase pathway for cohesin release would be specific to mitotic cells and will be safely suppressed during meiosis so as not to endanger the valuable chromosome connections. However, a previous study on budding yeast meiosis suggests the presence of cleavage-independent pathway of cohesin release during late prophase-I. In the work presented here we confirmed that the prophase pathway is not suppressed during meiosis, at least in budding yeast and showed that this cleavage-independent release is regulated by meiosis-specific phosphorylation of two cohesin subunits, Rec8 and Rad61(Wapl) by two cell-cycle regulators, PLK and DDK. Our results suggest that late meiotic prophase-I actively controls cohesin dynamics on meiotic chromosomes for chromosome segregation.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory networks are composed of sub-networks that are often shared across biological processes, cell-types, and organisms. Leveraging multiple sources of information, such as publicly available gene expression datasets, could therefore be helpful when learning a network of interest. Integrating data across different studies, however, raises numerous technical concerns. Hence, a common approach in network inference, and broadly in genomics research, is to separately learn models from each dataset and combine the results. Individual models, however, often suffer from under-sampling, poor generalization and limited network recovery. In this study, we explore previous integration strategies, such as batch-correction and model ensembles, and introduce a new multitask learning approach for joint network inference across several datasets. Our method initially estimates the activities of transcription factors, and subsequently, infers the relevant network topology. As regulatory interactions are context-dependent, we estimate model coefficients as a combination of both dataset-specific and conserved components. In addition, adaptive penalties may be used to favor models that include interactions derived from multiple sources of prior knowledge including orthogonal genomics experiments. We evaluate generalization and network recovery using examples from Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and show that sharing information across models improves network reconstruction. Finally, we demonstrate robustness to both false positives in the prior information and heterogeneity among datasets.",

    "abstract": "Membrane proteins sharing 7 transmembrane helices (7-TMH) dominate the polytopic TMH proteome. They cannot be grouped under a monolithic fold or superfold, however, a parallel structural analysis of folds around that magic number of 7-TMH in distinct 6/7/8-TMH protein superfamilies (SWEET, PnuC, TRIC, FocA, Aquaporin, GPCRs, AND MFS), reveals a common homology, not in their structural fold, but in their systematic pseudo-symmetric construction. Our analysis leads to guiding principles of intragenic duplication and pseudo-symmetric assembly of ancestral 3 or 4 Transmembrane Helix (3/4-TMH) protodomains/protofolds. A parallel deconstruction and reconstruction of these domains provides a structural and mechanistic framework for the evolution path of current pseudo-symmetrical transmembrane helical (TMH) proteins. It highlights the conformational plasticity inherent to fold formation itself. The sequence/structure analysis of different 6/7/8-TMH superfamilies provides a unifying theme of their evolutionary process involving the intragenic duplication of protodomains with varying degrees of sequence and fold divergence under conformational and functional constraints.",

    "abstract": "PurposeAmpliSeq technology, the target enrichment method for next-generation sequencing (NGS), enables quick and easy detection of the genomic \\\"hot spot\\\" region frequently mutated in species. Even though the cost of NGS has decreased, library preparation cost accounts for a more significant proportion of the total cost. If AmpliSeq library can be prepared at a lower cost, large-scale precision oncology can be more easily carried out. Furthermore, this technology can be widely applied not only to medical research, but also to polymorphism detection in biology. This study aimed to reduce the cost of AmpliSeq library preparation by adopting miniaturization technology.\\n\\nMethodsWe used approximately 10 ng of genomic DNA for ultra-multiplex PCR of 384, 768, 1152, 1920, and 3072 amplicons. Multiplex PCR was performed in a total volume of 1.6, 2.0, and 2.4 L, using a nano-liter liquid handler, for library preparation.\\n\\nResultsThe success rate of library construction decreased with decreasing total multiplex PCR reaction volume. Using 1.6-, 2.0-, and 2.4-L reactions, the success rates of ultra-multiplex PCR were 25%, 95%, and 100%, respectively. We could stably create libraries of the correct amplicon size, with an amplicon number of approximately 1500 or less. As a result of NGS, uniformity of PCR amplification and read length of quality-checked libraries were hardly affected by the number of amplicons.\\n\\nConclusionHere, we show that the minimum volume for a stable reaction was 2.4 L and the maximum number of amplicons obtained was approximately 1500. The protocol saved 86.8% in reagent usage and reduced handling time by 85% compared to that required by the manual protocol. Therefore, miniaturization technologies could reduce the cost of AmpliSeq library preparation through minimization of reagents.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation of various genomic regions plays an important role in regulating gene expression in diverse biological contexts. However, most genome-wide studies have focused on the effect of 1) methylation in cis, not in trans and 2) a single CpG, not the collective effects of multiple CpGs, on gene expression. In this study, we developed a statistical machine learning model, geneEXPLORER (gene expression prediction by long-range epigenetic regulation), that quantifies the collective effects of both cis- and trans- methylations on gene expression. By applying geneEXPLORER to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast and lung cancer data, we found that most genes are affected by methylations of as much as 10Mb from promoter regions or more, and the long-range methylation explains 50% of the variation in gene expression on average, far greater than cis-methylation. The highly predictive genes are related to breast cancer, especially oncogenes and suppressor genes. Further, the predicted gene expressions could predict clinical phenotypes such as breast tumor status and estrogen receptor status (AUC=0.999, 0.94 respectively) as accurately as the measured gene expression levels. These results suggest that geneEXPLORER provides a means for accurate imputation of gene expression, which can be further used to predict clinical phenotypes.",

We performed GWAS on three traits (grain yield, plant height and male flowering time) measured in 22 environments on a panel of 247 diverse dent maize inbred lines using three genotyping technologies (Genotyping-By-Sequencing, Illumina Infinium 50K and Affymetrix Axiom 600K arrays).\\n\\nResultsThe effects of ascertainment bias of both arrays were negligible for deciphering global genetic trends of diversity in this panel and for estimating relatedness. We developed an original approach based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) extent in order to determine whether SNPs significantly associated with a trait and that are physically linked should be considered as a single QTL or several independent QTLs. Using this approach, we showed that the combination of the three technologies, which have different SNP distribution and density, allowed us to detect more Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs, gain in power) and potentially refine the localization of the causal polymorphisms (gain in position).\\n\\nConclusionsConceptually different technologies are complementary for detecting QTLs by tagging different haplotypes in association studies. Considering LD, marker density and the combination of different technologies (arrays and re-sequencing), the genotypic data presently available were most likely enough to well represent polymorphisms in the centromeric regions, whereas using more markers would be beneficial for telomeric regions.",

    "abstract": "Transport of proteins and lipids from one membrane compartment to another is via intracellular vesicles. We investigated the function of Tumor Protein D54 (TPD54/TPD52L2), and found that TPD54 was involved in multiple membrane trafficking pathways: anterograde traffic, recycling and Golgi integrity. To understand how TPD54 controls these diverse functions, we used an inducible method to reroute TPD54 to mitochondria. Surprisingly, this manipulation resulted in the capture of many small vesicles (30 nm diameter) at the mitochondrial surface. Super-resolution imaging confirmed the presence of similarly sized TPD54-positive structures under normal conditions. It appears that TPD54 defines a new class of transport vesicle, which we term intracellular nanovesicles (INVs). INVs meet three criteria for functionality. They contain specific cargo, they have certain R-SNAREs for fusion, and they are endowed with a variety of Rab GTPases (16 out of 43 tested). The molecular heterogeneity of INVs and the diverse functions of TPD54 suggest that INVs have various membrane origins and a number of destinations. We propose that INVs are a generic class of transport vesicle which transfer cargo between these varied locations.",

In living cells, these DNA segments can be placed far from each other on the same chromosome. However, no direct evidence for this to occur has been described so far due to lack of proper methodology.\\n\\nResultsThe beta isoform of topo II (topo II{beta}) is essential for transcriptional regulation of genes expressed in the final stage of neuronal differentiation. To elucidate the enzymes role in the process, here we devise a genome-wide mapping technique for topo II{beta} target sites that can measure the genomic distance between G- and T-segments. It became clear that the enzyme operates in two distinctive modes, termed proximal strand passage (PSP) and distal strand passage (DSP). PSP sites are concentrated around transcription start sites, whereas DSP sites are heavily clustered in small number of hotspots. While PSP represent the conventional topo II targets that remove local torsional stresses, DSP sites have not been described previously. Most remarkably, DSP is driven by the pairing between homologous sequences or repeats located in a large distance. A model-building approach suggested that the DSP sites are intertwined or knotted and topo II{beta} is engaged in unknotting reaction that leads to chromatin decondensation and gene regulation.\\n\\nConclusionsWhen combined with categorized gene expression analysis, the model-based prediction of DSP sites reveals that DSP is one of the key factors for topo II{beta}-dependency of neuronal gene regulation.",

This study evaluates two aspects of the selection process of the top-ranked applicants to the EMBO Long-Term Fellowship program in 2007. First, the accuracy of the system is evaluated by comparing the level of career progression of the candidates in 2017 with the original award decisions made in 2007. The second aspect, explores the relationship of career progression with indicators derived from the information available to evaluators at the time of application. The results obtained suggest that the peer review system is not substantially better than random selection in identifying the best candidates once an initial pre-selection of the most promising ones is performed. Not only that, the analysis of the indicators studied, some of which have not been analyzed in detail in the past, suggests that among other potential sources of uncertainty, the information available at the time of application is not sufficiently predictive of career progression. As previously described, however, we find clear differences in career progression between men and women. We propose a new mixed model of fellowship evaluation in which peer review is used to select high quality applications, and random allocation of funds is subsequently used to award fellowships among these top ranked candidates.",

    "abstract": "Ecological communities are jointly structured by dispersal, density-independent responses to environmental conditions and density-dependent biotic interactions. Metacommunity ecology provides a framework for understanding how these processes combine to determine community composition among local sites that are regionally connected through dispersal. In 17 temperate seagrass meadows along the British Columbia coast, we tested the hypothesis that eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) epifaunal invertebrate assemblages are influenced by local environmental conditions, but that high dispersal rates at larger spatial scales dampen effects of environmental differences. We used hierarchical joint species distribution modelling to understand the contribution of environmental conditions, spatial distance between meadows, and species co-occurrences to epifaunal invertebrate abundance and distribution across the region. We found that patterns of taxonomic compositional similarity among meadows were inconsistent with dispersal limitation and meadows in the same region were often no more similar to each other than meadows over 1000 km away. Abiotic environmental conditions (temperature, dissolved oxygen) explained a small fraction of variation in taxonomic abundances patterns across the region. We found novel co-occurrence patterns among taxa that could not be explained by shared responses to environmental gradients, suggesting the possibility that interspecific interactions influence seagrass invertebrate abundance and distribution. Our results add to mounting evidence that suggests that the biodiversity and ecosystem functions provided by seagrass meadows reflect ecological processes occurring both within meadows and across seascapes, and suggest that management of eelgrass habitat for biodiversity may be most effective when both local and regional processes are considered.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the aetiology of monogenic Parkinsons disease (PD). Yet the role that mitochondrial processes play in the most common form of the disease; sporadic PD, is yet to be fully established. Here we comprehensively assessed the role of mitochondrial function associated genes in sporadic PD by leveraging improvements in the scale and analysis of PD GWAS data with recent advances in our understanding of the genetics of mitochondrial disease. First, we identified that a proportion of the \\\"missing heritability\\\" of the PD can be explained by common variation within genes implicated in mitochondrial disease (primary gene list) and mitochondrial function (secondary gene list). Next we calculated a mitochondrial-specific polygenic risk score (PRS) and showed that cumulative small effect variants within both our primary and secondary gene lists are significantly associated with increased PD risk. Most significantly we further report that the PRS of the secondary mitochondrial gene list was significantly associated with later age at onset. Finally, to identify possible functional genomic associations we implemented Mendelian randomisation, which showed that 14 of these mitochondrial function associated genes showed functional consequence associated with PD risk. Further analysis suggested that the 14 identified genes are not only involved in mitophagy but implicate new mitochondrial processes. Our data suggests that therapeutics targeting mitochondrial bioenergetics and proteostasis pathways distinct from mitophagy could be beneficial to treating the early stage of PD.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria can readily generate mutations that prevent bacteriophage (phage) adsorption and thus make bacteria resistant to infections with these viruses. Nevertheless, the majority of bacteria carry complex innate and/or adaptive immune systems: restriction-modification (RM) and CRISPR-Cas, respectively. Both RM and CRISPR-Cas are commonly assumed to have evolved and be maintained to protect bacteria from succumbing to infections with lytic phage. Using mathematical models and computer simulations, we explore the conditions, under which selection mediated by lytic phage will favor such complex innate and adaptive immune systems, as opposed to simple envelope resistance. The results of our analysis suggest that when populations of bacteria are confronted with lytic phage: (i) In the absence of immunity, resistance to even multiple bacteriophage species with independent receptors can evolve readily. (ii) RM immunity can benefit bacteria by preventing phage from invading established bacterial populations and particularly so when there are multiple bacteriophage species adsorbing to different receptors. (iii) Whether CRISPR-Cas immunity will prevail over envelope resistance depends critically on the length of the co-evolutionary arms race between the bacteria acquiring spacers and the phage generating CRISPR-escape mutants. We discuss the implications of these results in the context of the evolution and maintenance of RM and CRISPR-Cas and highlight fundamental questions that remain unanswered.\\n\\nSummaryThe two most widely used tools for manipulating and editing DNA restriction and Cas9 endonucleases both originate from studies of mechanisms that provide bacteria with immunity to infections with lytic bacteriophage (phage): restriction modification and CRISPR-Cas. Using mathematical and computer simulations, we explore the a priori conditions under which selection mediated by lytic phage will favor the evolution and maintenance of restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas immunity in bacteria that, by mutation, can generate envelope resistance to these phage. The results of our analysis make predictions and raise testable-hypotheses about the genetic and ecological conditions under which these immune systems, rather than envelope resistance, will evolve and be maintained as the dominant mechanism of protecting bacteria from succumbing to infections with these viruses.",

To explore this, we implanted microelectrodes into the VTCs of eight human subjects undergoing invasive epilepsy monitoring.

    "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) are a promising in vitro tool for drug development and disease modeling, but their immature electrophysiology limits diagnostic utility. Tissue engineering approaches involving aligned 3D cultures enhance hiPSC-CM structural maturation but are insufficient to induce mature electrophysiology. We hypothesized that mimicking post-natal switching of the hearts primary ATP source from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation could enhance electrophysiological maturation of hiPSC-CM. We combined hiPSC-CM with microfabricated culture chambers to form 3D cardiac microphysiological systems (MPS) that enhanced immediate microtissue alignment and tissue specific extracellular matrix (ECM) production. Using Robust Experimental design, we identified a maturation media that improved calcium handling in MPS derived from two genetically distinct hiPSC sources. Although calcium handling and metabolic maturation were improved in both genotypes, there was a divergent effect on action potential duration (APD): MPS that started with abnormally prolonged APD exhibited shorter APD in response to maturation media, whereas the same media prolonged the APD in MPS that started with aberrantly short APD. Importantly, the APD of both genotypes was brought near the range of 270-300ms observed in human left ventricular cardiomyocytes. Mathematical modeling explained these divergent phenotypes, and further predicted the response of matured MPS to drugs with known pro-arrhythmic effects. These results suggest that systematic combination of biophysical stimuli and metabolic cues can enhance the electrophysiological maturation of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. However, they also reveal that maturation-inducing cues can have differential effects on electrophysiology depending on the baseline phenotype of hiPSC-CM. In silico models provide a valuable tool for predicting how changes in cellular maturation will manifest in drug responsiveness.",

    "abstract": "Farming landscapes of Europe are vital arenas for social-ecological sustainability because of their significant coverage and potential to integrate food production with biodiversity conservation. Knowledge gathered by scientific research is a critical ingredient for developing and implementing socio-economically and ecologically sustainable grassland management strategies for grasslands. The quality of scientific knowledge and its potential to address grasslands as complex social-ecological systems is strongly dependent on the creativity and scientific ambition of the researcher, but also on the network (from academic and non-academic sectors) around the researcher. The goal of this paper is to map the research network around Romanias grasslands. These systems have exceptional socio-cultural and economic values and are between the most biodiverse ecosystems of the world. Considering the multiple threats to these grasslands, it is an urgent need to understand the existing scientific knowledge profile around these systems. This paper aims at using bibliometrics analysis, a well-developed scientific domain that envisages network theory to analyze relationships between affiliations network, co-authorship network, and co-word analysis. The number of studies targeting grassland management in Romania is increasing mainly thanks to international involvement. However, the management of the grasslands is still deficient and the contribution of science to the process is virtually absent. The subject of research is mainly related to the biological and ecological characteristics of grasslands, a notable absence from internationally visible research being the management of grasslands, especially in the context of EU Common Agricultural Policies. To increase scientific performance, and better inform EU and local policies on grassland management, Romanian researchers should better capitalize on international collaborations and local academic leaders. Our findings can be used to identify research gaps and to improve collaboration and knowledge exchange between practitioners, scientists, policy makers, and stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial secondary symbionts are very common in terrestrial arthropods, but infection levels vary widely among populations. Experiments and within-species comparisons both suggest that environmental temperature might be important in explaining this variation. To investigate the importance of temperature, at broad geographical and taxonomic scales, we extended a global database of terrestrial arthropods screened for Wolbachia and Cardinium. Our final data set contained data from 114,297 arthropods (>2,500 species) screened for Wolbachia and 17,011 arthropods (>800 species) screened for Cardinium, including population samples from 137 different countries, and with mean temperatures varying from - 6.5 to 29.2{degrees}C. In insects and relatives, Cardinium infection showed a clear and consistent tendency to increase with temperature. For Wolbachia, a tendency to increase with temperature in temperate climates, is counteracted by reduced prevalence in the tropics, resulting in a weak negative trend overall. We discuss the implications of these results for natural and introduced symbionts, in regions affected by climate change.",

    "abstract": "While the genetic suppressor screen is efficient in suggesting therapeutic genes, this strategy has yet to be successful for cardiomyopathies in vertebrates. To develop such a strategy, we recently established a mutagenesis screen platform in zebrafish for systematic discovery of genetic modifiers of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy (DIC). Here, we further revealed both molecular and cellular insights of the first salutary modifier emerged from the screen, i.e. gene-breaking transposon (GBT) 0419 that affects the retinoid X receptor alpha a (rxraa) gene. First, by rescuing the mutation in tissue-specific manner with multiple Cre-loxP systems, we demonstrated that the endothelial, but not myocardial or epicardial, function of rxraa is primary to this cardioprotective effects. Next, we showed that the rxraa-associated salutary effects on DIC were conferred partially by the activation of retinoid acid (RA) signaling. Finally, we identified isotretinoin and bexarotene, 2 US Food and Drug Administration-approved RXRA agonists that are effective in treating adult zebrafish DIC when administered during the early, but not the late, phase of DIC progression. Collectively, we provided the first in vivo genetic evidence in supporting RXRA as the therapeutic target for DIC, and uncovered a previously unrecognized spatiotemporally-restricted mechanism for this gene-based therapeutic strategy. Our study also justified that searching salutary modifiers via zebrafish mutagenesis screen can be effective in discovering new therapeutic targets for cardiomyopathies.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveMaladaptive aggression, as present in conduct disorder (CD) and, to a lesser extent, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), has been associated with structural alterations in various brain regions, such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala, insula and ventral striatum. Although aggression can be subdivided into reactive and proactive subtypes, no neuroimaging studies have yet investigated if any structural brain alterations are associated with either of the subtypes specifically. Here we investigated this association in predefined regions of interest.\\n\\nMethodT1-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired from 158 children and adolescents with aggressive behavior (ODD/CD) and 96 controls in a multi-centre study. Aggression subtypes were assessed by questionnaires. Cortical volume and subcortical volumes and shape were determined using Freesurfer and the FMRIB integrated registration and segmentation tool. Associations between volumes and continuous measures of aggression were established using multilevel linear mixed effects models.\\n\\nResultsIn cases only proactive aggression was negatively associated with amygdala volume (b=-11.82, p=0.05), while reactive aggression was negatively associated with insula volume (b=-46.41, p=0.01). Classical group comparison showed that children and adolescents with aggressive behavior had smaller volumes than controls in (bilateral) ventral striatum (p=0.003), ACC (p=0.01), and vmPFC (p=0.003) with modest effect sizes.\\n\\nConclusionsAggression was associated with reduced volume in brain regions involved in decision making. Negative associations were found between reactive aggression and volumes in regions involved in threat responsivity and between proactive aggression and regions linked to empathy. This provides evidence for aggression subtype-specific alterations in brain structure.",

Recent BCIs based on visual evoked potentials (VEPs) have shown to be suitable for high-speed communication. However, all recent high-speed BCIs are synchronous, which means that the system works with fixed time slots so that the user is not able to select a command at his own convenience, which poses a problem in real-world applications. In this paper, we present the first asynchronous high-speed BCI with robust distinction between intentional control (IC) and non-control (NC), with a nearly perfect NC state detection of only 0.075 erroneous classifications per minute. The resulting asynchronous speller achieved an average information transfer rate (ITR) of 122.7 bit/min using a 32 target matrix-keyboard. Since the method is based on random stimulation patterns it allows to use an arbitrary number of targets for any application purpose, which was shown by using an 55 target German QWERTZ-keyboard layout which allowed the participants to write an average of 16.1 (up to 30.7) correct case-sensitive letters per minute. As the presented system is the first asynchronous high-speed BCI speller with a robust non-control state detection, it is an important step for moving BCI applications out of the lab and into real-life.",

The goal of this study was to parse heterogeneity in a core executive function, cognitive flexibility, in children with a range of abilities (N=132; children with autism spectrum disorder [ASD], attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], and typically developing [TD] children) using directed functional connectivity profiles derived from resting-state fMRI data. Brain regions activated in response to a cognitive flexibility task in adults were used guide region-of-interest (ROI) selection to estimate individual connectivity profiles in this study. We expected to find at least three subgroups of children who differed in their network connectivity metrics and symptom measures. Unexpectedly, we did not find a stable or valid subgrouping solution, which suggests that categorical models of the neural substrates of cognitive flexibility in children may be invalid. Results shed light on the validity of conceptualizing the neural substrates of cognitive flexibility categorically in children. Ultimately, this work may provide a foundation for the development of a revised nosology focused on neurobiological substrates of mental illness as an alternative to traditional symptom-based classification systems.",

At all levels of the spinal cord examined, NADPH-d activities were present in neurons and fibers in the superficial dorsal horn, dorsal commissure and in neurons around the central canal. In addition, the sympathetic autonomic nucleus in the thoracic and rostral lumbar segments exhibited prominent NADPH-d cellular staining whereas the sacral parasympathetic nucleus (SPN) in the sacral segments was not well stained. Interestingly, we found abundant NADPH-d positive enlarged-diameter fibers termed megaloneurite, which characteristically occurred in the aged sacral segments, distributed in the dorsal gray commissure (DGC), lateral collateral pathway (LCP) the lateral fasciculi and the central canal compared with the cervical, thoracic and lumbar segments. The dense, abnormal NADPH-d megaloneurites occurred in extending from dorsal entry zone through lamina I along with the lateral boundary of the dorsal horn to the region of the SPN. These fibers were prominent in the S1-S3 segments but not in adjacent segments L5-L7 and Cx1 or in thoracolumbar segments and cervical segments. Double staining with GFAP, NeuN, CGRP, MAP2 and Iba1, NADPH-d megaloneurite colocalized with vasoactive intestinal peptide. Presumably, the megaloneurites may represent, in part, visceral afferent projections to the SPN and/or DGC.

However, posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS) appeared to play a role in driving the neural effect. In addition, CA showed increased functional connectivity relative to UC between the rTPJ and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Finally, the agents false belief about the presence of the ball speeded participants response (ToM index), but without group differences. These findings highlight that experiencing early interpersonal trauma can alter brain areas involved in the neural processing of ToM and perspective-taking during adulthood.",

    "abstract": "The prefrontal cortex plays a central role in guiding decision-making, and its function is altered by alcohol use and an individuals innate risk for excessive alcohol drinking. The primary goal of this work was to determine how neural activity in the prefrontal cortex guides the decision to drink. Towards this goal, the within-session changes in neural activity were measured from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats performing a drinking procedure that allowed them to consume or abstain from alcohol in a self-paced manner. Recordings were obtained from rats that either lacked or expressed an innate risk for excessive alcohol intake - Wistar or Alcohol Preferring  P rats, respectively. Wistar rats exhibited patterns of neural activity consistent with the intention to drink or abstain from drinking, whereas these patterns were blunted or absent in P rats. Collectively, these data indicate that neural activity patterns in mPFC associated with the intention to drink alcohol are influenced by innate risk for excessive alcohol drinking. This observation may indicate a lack of control over the decision to drink by this otherwise well-validated supervisory brain region.",

    "abstract": "Maternal infection is a shared environmental risk factor for a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders and animal models of maternal immune activation (MIA) exhibit a range of neuropathologies and behaviors with relevance to these disorders. In particular, MIA offspring show chronic, age- and region-dependent changes in brain cytokines, a feature seen in postmortem studies of individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders. These MIA-induced alterations in brain cytokines may index biological processes underlying progression to diagnosable neuropsychiatric disorders. However, cytokines signal through specific cytokine receptors to alter cellular processes and it is the levels of those receptors that are critical for signaling. Yet, it remains unknown whether MIA alters the expression of cytokine receptors in the brains of offspring throughout postnatal development. Here, we measured the expression of 23 cytokine receptors in the frontal cortex of MIA and control offspring from birth to adulthood using qPCR. MIA offspring show dynamic oscillating alterations in cytokine receptors during sensitive periods of neural growth and synaptogenesis. Of the many cytokine receptors altered in the FC of MIA offspring, five were significantly changed at multiple ages at levels over 2-fold relative to controls--Il1r1, Ifngr1, Il10ra, Cx3cr1 and Gmcsfr--suggesting persistent dysfunction within those pathways. In addition to facilitating immune responses, these cytokine receptors play critical roles in neuronal migration and maturation, synapse formation and elimination, and microglial function. Together with previously reported changes in cytokine levels in the brains of MIA offspring, our results show a decrease in cytokine signaling during the peak period of synaptogenesis and spine formation and an increase during periods of activity-dependent development and early adulthood. Overall, the oscillating, age-dependent cytokine receptor alterations in the FC of MIA offspring identified here may have diagnostic and therapeutic value for neuropsychiatric disorders with a neuro-immune etiology.\\n\\nResearch HighlightMaternal immune activation leads to long-lasting, oscillating changes in cytokine receptors in the frontal cortex of offspring throughout development.",

    "abstract": "Netrin-1 was initially characterized as an axon guidance molecule that is essential for normal embryonic neural development; however, many types of neurons continue to express netrin-1 in the post-natal and adult mammalian brain. Netrin-1 and the netrin receptor DCC are both enriched at synapses. In the adult hippocampus, activity-dependent secretion of netrin-1 by neurons potentiates glutamatergic synapse function, and is critical for long-term potentiation, an experimental cellular model of learning and memory. Here, we assessed the impact of neuronal expression of netrin-1 in the adult brain on behavior using tests of learning and memory. We show that adult mice exhibit impaired spatial memory following conditional deletion of netrin-1 from glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampus and neocortex. Further, we provide evidence that mice with conditional deletion of netrin-1 do not display aberrant anxiety-like phenotypes and show a reduction in self-grooming behaviour. These findings reveal a critical role for netrin-1 expressed by neurons in the regulation of spatial memory formation.",

We interpret this observation as evidence that the FD model is superior to conventional connectivity analysis, by stressing relevant features of the whole brain connectivity including functional, structural and topological signatures. The FD model can be used in future research to model subtle alterations of functional and structural connectivity resulting in pronounced clinical syndromes and major psychiatric disorders.

Proteomic analysis identified three serum proteins reduced in susceptible animals; lipidomic analysis detected differences in lipid species between resilient and susceptible animals in serum and brain; and metabolomic analysis revealed pathway dysfunctions of purine metabolism, beta oxidation, and antioxidants, which were differentially associated with stress susceptibility vs resilience by brain region. Antidepressant treatment ameliorated MDD-like behaviors and affected key metabolites within outlined networks, most dramatically in the ventral hippocampus.

Deciphering the logic of this diversity requires overcoming the technical challenge of quantitative and comprehensive analysis of multi-modal cell features as well as the conceptual challenge of formulating a framework of neuronal identity that reflects biological mechanisms and principles. In the past few years, advances in high-throughput single cell analyses began to generate unprecedented datasets on interneuron transcriptomes, morphology and electrophysiology that drive their classification. Recent studies suggest that cardinal interneuron types can be defined by their synaptic communication properties encoded in key transcriptional signatures - a conceptual framework that integrates across phenotypic features and captures neuronal input-output properties elemental to circuit operation. This definition may further facilitate understanding the appropriate granularity of neuron types toward building a biologically-grounded and operationally useful interneuron taxonomy.",

    "abstract": "An organisms ability to respond effectively to environmental change is critical to their survival. Yet, life stage and overall condition can dictate tolerance thresholds to heightened environmental stressors, such that stress may not be equally felt across individuals within a species. Environmental changes can induce transcriptional responses in an organism, some of which reflect generalized responses, and others are highly specific to the type of change being experienced. Thus, if transcriptional biomarkers specific to a heightened environmental stressor, even under multi-stressor impacts, can be identified, the biomarkers could be then applied in natural environments to determine when and where individuals are experiencing such stressors. Here, we validate candidate gill gene expression biomarkers by experimentally challenging juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). A sophisticated experimental set-up (four trials) manipulated salinity (freshwater, brackish water, and seawater), temperature (10, 14, and 18{degrees}C), and dissolved oxygen (normoxia and hypoxia), in all 18 possible combinations, for up to six days during the pre-smolt, smolt, and de-smolt life stages. In addition, we also describe the changes in juvenile behaviour, plasma variables, gill Na+/K+- ATPase (NKA) activity, body size, body morphology, and skin pigmentation associated with salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, mortality, and smolt status. We statistically identified biomarkers specific to salinity and temperature treatments, as well as mortality across multiple stressors and life stages. Similar biomarkers for the dissolved oxygen treatment could not be identified in the data and we discuss our next steps using an RNA-seq study. This work demonstrates the unique power of gene expression biomarkers to identify a specific stressor even under multi-stressor conditions.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination is a major molecular mechanism generating genomic diversity. Recombination rates vary across the genome, often involving localized crossover \\\"hotspots\\\" and \\\"coldspots\\\". Studying the molecular basis and mechanism underlying this variation within and among individuals has been challenging due to the high cost and effort required to construct individualized genome-wide maps of recombination crossovers. In this study we introduce a new method to detect recombination crossovers across the genome from sperm DNA using Illumina sequencing of linked-read libraries produced using 10X Genomics technology. We leverage the long range information provided by the linked short reads to phase and assign haplotype states to each DNA molecule. When applied to DNA from gametes of a diploid organism, the majority of linked-read molecules can be used to faithfully reconstruct an individuals two haplotypes present at each location in the genome. A valuable rare fraction of molecules that span meiotic crossovers between the two chromosome haplotypes can then be isolated from the broader population of nonrecombinant molecules. Our pipeline, called ReMIX, allows us to characterize the genomic location and intensity of meiotic crossovers in a single individual and faithfully detects previously described recombination hotspots discovered by studies using mapping panels in mice. With a median crossover resolution of the mouse and stickleback being 15kb and 23kb respectively, ReMIX provides a powerful, high-throughput, low-cost approach to quantify recombination variation across the genome opening up numerous opportunities to study recombination variation with high genomic resolution in multiple individuals.

    "abstract": "A continuing challenge in quantitative cell biology is the accurate and robust 3D segmentation of structures of interest from fluorescence microscopy images in an automated, reproducible, and widely accessible manner for subsequent interpretable data analysis. We describe the Allen Cell and Structure Segmenter (Segmenter), a Python-based open source toolkit developed for 3D segmentation of cells and intracellular structures in fluorescence microscope images. This toolkit brings together classic image segmentation and iterative deep learning workflows first to generate initial high-quality 3D intracellular structure segmentations and then to easily curate these results to generate the ground truths for building robust and accurate deep learning models. The toolkit takes advantage of the high-replicate 3D live cell image data collected at the Allen Institute for Cell Science of over 30 endogenous fluorescently tagged human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines. Each cell line represents a different intracellular structure with one or more distinct localization patterns within undifferentiated hiPS cells and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. The Segmenter consists of two complementary elements, a classic image segmentation workflow with a restricted set of algorithms and parameters and an iterative deep learning segmentation workflow. We created a collection of 20 classic image segmentation workflows based on 20 distinct and representative intracellular structure localization patterns as a \"lookup table\" reference and starting point for users. The iterative deep learning workflow can take over when the classic segmentation workflow is insufficient. Two straightforward \"human-in-the-loop\" curation strategies convert a set of classic image segmentation workflow results into a set of 3D ground truth images for iterative model training without the need for manual painting in 3D. The deep learning model architectures used in this toolkit were designed and tested specifically for 3D fluorescence microscope images and implemented as readable scripts. The Segmenter thus leverages state of the art computer vision algorithms in an accessible way to facilitate their application by the experimental biology researcher.\n\nWe include two useful applications to demonstrate how we used the classic image segmentation and iterative deep learning workflows to solve more challenging 3D segmentation tasks. First, we introduce the  Training Assay approach, a new experimental-computational co-design concept to generate more biologically accurate segmentation ground truths. We combined the iterative deep learning workflow with three Training Assays to develop a robust, scalable cell and nuclear instance segmentation algorithm, which could achieve accurate target segmentation for over 98% of individual cells and over 80% of entire fields of view. Second, we demonstrate how to extend the lamin B1 segmentation model built from the iterative deep learning workflow to obtain more biologically accurate lamin B1 segmentation by utilizing multi-channel inputs and combining multiple ML models. The steps and workflows used to develop these algorithms are generalizable to other similar segmentation challenges. More information, including tutorials and code repositories, are available at allencell.org/segmenter.",

We observed increased VEGFR-2 expression in LNM compared with NMT and a positive correlation between tumor grade and VEGFR-2 expression. A positive correlation was noted between VEGFR-2 and PDGFR expression. Regarding microvascular density (MVD), we identified a higher number of vessels in primary tumors with lymph node metastasis and lung metastasis compared with tumors with no metastasis. The primary tumors with lung metastasis exhibited an increased MVD compared with carcinoma with lymph node metastasis.

The cardiovascular defects consist of abnormal aortic arches and hypoplastic ventricle, driven by previously unknown aberrant endocardial and endothelial vasculogenesis. We identify a regulatory link between the Notch pathway and Kmt2d during vasculogenesis and show that pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling rescues the cardiovascular phenotype in zebrafish Kabuki Syndrome.

Here, we extend modeling to reproduce not only the final plumage pattern of birds, but also the observed natural variation in its dynamics of emergence in five species. We built a unified model intrinsically generating the directionality, sequence, and duration of patterning, and used in vivo experiments to test its parameter-based predictions. We showed that while patterning duration is controlled by overall cell proliferation, its directional and sequential progression result from a pre-pattern: an initial break in surface symmetry launches a traveling front of increased cell density that defines domains with self-organizing capacity. These results show that universal mechanisms combining pre-patterning and self-organization govern the timely emergence of the plumage pattern in birds.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) controls critical cellular functions such as protein synthesis, lipid metabolism, protein turnover and ribosome biogenesis through the phosphorylation of multiple substrates. In this study, we examined the phosphorylation of a recently identified target of mTORC1: La-related protein 1 (LARP1), a member of the LARP superfamily. Previously, we and others have shown that LARP1 plays an important role in repressing TOP mRNA translation downstream of mTORC1. LARP1 binds the 7-methylguanosine triphosphate (m7Gppp) cap moiety and the adjacent 5terminal oligopyrimidine (5TOP) motif of TOP mRNAs, thus impeding the assembly of the eIF4F complex on these transcripts. mTORC1 plays a critical role in the control of TOP mRNA translation via LARP1 but the precise mechanism by which this occurs is incompletely understood. The data described herein help to elucidate this process. Specifically, it show that: (i) mTORC1 interacts with LARP1, but not other LARP superfamily members, via the C-terminal region that comprises the DM15 domain, (ii) mTORC1 pathway controls the phosphorylation of multiple (up to 26) serine and threonine residues on LARP1 in vivo, (iii) mTORC1 regulates the binding of LARP1 to TOP mRNAs and (iv) phosphorylation of S689 by mTORC1 is particularly important for the association of the DM15 domain of LARP1 with the 5UTR of RPS6 TOP mRNA. These data reveal LARP1 as a major substrate of mTORC1.",

    "abstract": "Proteins need to interconvert between many conformations in order to function, many of which are formed transiently, and sparsely populated. Particularly when the lifetimes of these states approach the millisecond timescale, identifying the relevant structures and the mechanism by which they inter-convert remains a tremendous challenge. Here we introduce a novel combination of accelerated MD (aMD) simulations and Markov State modelling (MSM) to explore these  excited conformational states. Applying this to the highly dynamic protein CypA, a protein involved in immune response and associated with HIV infection, we identify five principally populated conformational states and the atomistic mechanism by which they interconvert. A rational design strategy predicted that the mutant D66A should stabilise the minor conformations and substantially alter the dynamics whereas the similar mutant H70A should leave the landscape broadly unchanged. These predictions are confirmed using CPMG and R1{rho} solution state NMR measurements. By accurately and reliably exploring functionally relevant, but sparsely populated conformations with milli-second lifetimes in silico, our aMD/MSM method has tremendous promise for the design of dynamic protein free energy landscapes for both protein engineering and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is an aggressive cancer caused by chromosomal translocations generating fusions of the EWSR1 gene with ETS transcription factors (in 85% FLI1). EWSR1-FLI1 induces gene expression via binding to enhancer-like GGAA-microsatellites, whose activity increases with the number of consecutive GGAA-repeats.\\n\\nHerein, we investigate the role of the secretory neuropeptide CALCB (calcitonin related polypeptide {beta}) in EwS, which signals via the CGRP-(calcitonin gene-related peptide) receptor complex, containing RAMP1 (receptor activity modifying protein 1) as crucial part for receptor specificity. Analysis of 2,678 gene expression microarrays comprising 50 tumor entities and 71 normal tissue types revealed that CALCB is specifically and highly overexpressed in EwS. Time-course knockdown experiments showed that CALCB expression is tightly linked to that of EWSR1-FLI1. Consistently, gene set enrichment analyses of genes whose expression in primary EwS is correlated to that of CALCB indicated that it is co-expressed with other EWSR1-FLI1 target genes and associated with signatures involved in stemness and proliferation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) data for EWSR1-FLI1 and histone marks from EwS cells demonstrated that EWSR1-FLI1 binds to a GGAA-microsatellite close to CALCB, which exhibits characteristics of an active enhancer. Reporter assays confirmed the strong EWSR1-FLI1- and length-dependent enhancer activity of this GGAA-microsatellite. Mass-spectrometry analyses of supernatants of EwS cell cultures demonstrated that CALCB is secreted by EwS cells. While short-term RNA interference-mediated CALCB knockdown had no effect on proliferation and clonogenic growth of EwS cells in vitro, its long-term knockdown decreased EwS growth in vitro and in vivo. Similarly, knockdown of RAMP1 reduced clonogenic/spheroidal growth and tumorigenicity, and small-molecule inhibitors directed against the CGRP-receptor comprising RAMP1 reduced growth of EwS.\\n\\nCollectively, our findings suggest that CALCB is a direct EWSR1-FLI1 target and that targeting the CALCB/RAMP1-axis may offer a new therapeutic strategy for inhibition of EwS growth.",

    "abstract": "The nephron is composed of distinct segments that perform unique physiological functions to generate urine. Little is known about how multipotent nephron progenitor cells differentiate into different nephron segments. It is well known that Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling regulates the maintenance and commitment of mesenchymal nephron progenitors during kidney development. However, it is not fully understood how it regulates nephron patterning after nephron progenitors undergo mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. To address this, we performed {beta}-catenin loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies in epithelial nephron progenitors in the mouse kidney. Consistent with a previous report, the formation of the renal corpuscle was defective in the absence of {beta}-catenin. Interestingly, we found that epithelial nephron progenitors lacking {beta}-catenin were able to form presumptive proximal tubules but that they failed to further develop into differentiated proximal tubules, suggesting that Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling plays a critical role in proximal tubule development. We also found that epithelial nephron progenitors lacking {beta}-catenin failed to form the distal tubules. Constitutive activation of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling blocked the proper formation of all nephron segments, suggesting tight regulation of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling during nephron patterning. This work shows that Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling regulates the patterning of multiple nephron segments along the proximo-distal axis of the mammalian nephron.",

    "abstract": "Controlling stochastic reactions networks is a challenging problem with important implications in various fields such as systems and synthetic biology. Various regulation motifs have been discovered or posited over the recent years, a very recent one being the so-called Antithetic Integral Control (AIC) motif [3]. Several appealing properties for the AIC motif have been demonstrated for classes of reaction networks that satisfy certain irreducibility, ergodicity and output controllability conditions. Here we address the problem of verifying these conditions for large sets of reaction networks with time-invariant topologies, either from a robust or a structural viewpoint, using three different approaches. The first one adopts a robust viewpoint and relies on the notion of interval matrices. The second one adopts a structural viewpoint and is based on sign properties of matrices. The last one is a direct approach where the parameter dependence is exactly taken into account and can be used to obtain both robust and structural conditions. The obtained results lie in the same spirit as those obtained in [3] where properties of reaction networks are independently characterized in terms of control theoretic concepts, linear programs, and graph-theoretic/algebraic conditions. Alternatively, those conditions can be cast as convex optimization problems that can be checked efficiently using modern optimization methods. Several examples are given for illustration.",

    "abstract": "Analysis methods based on simulations and optimization have been previously developed to estimate relative translation rates from next-generation sequencing data. Translation involves molecules and chemical reactions; hence, bioinformatics methods consistent with the laws of chemistry and physics are more likely to produce accurate results. Here, we derive simple equations based on chemical kinetic principles to measure the translation-initiation rate, transcriptome-wide elongation rate, and individual codon translation rates from ribosome profiling experiments. Our methods reproduce the known rates from ribosome profiles generated from detailed simulations of translation. Applying our methods to data from S. cerevisiae and mouse embryonic stem cells we find that the extracted rates reproduce expected correlations with various molecular properties. A codon can exhibit up to 26-fold variability in its translation rate depending upon its context within a transcript. This broad distribution means that the average translation rate of a codon is not representative of the rate at which most instances of that codon are translated. We also find that mouse embryonic stem cells have a global translation speed of 5.2 AA/s, is similar to what has been previous reported using another analysis method. This large variability in translation rates suggests that translational regulation might be used by cells to a greater degree than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of a single, non-optimal codon cluster into a transcript was found to cause ribosomes to queue upstream of it and decrease the transcripts half-life through the action of the dead box protein Dhh1p, which interacts with stalled ribosomes and promotes transcript degradation. Naturally occurring transcripts often contain multiple slow codon clusters, but the influence of these combinations of clusters on a transcripts half-life is unknown. Using a kinetic model that describes translation and mRNA degradation, we find that the introduction of a second slow codon cluster into a transcript near the 5'-end can have the opposite effect than that of the first cluster by increasing the mRNAs half-life. We experimentally validate this finding by showing that S. cerevisiae transcripts that only have a slow codon cluster towards the 3'-end of the coding sequence have shorter half-lives than transcripts with non-optimal clusters at both 3' and 5' -ends. The origin of this increase in half-life arises from the 5'-end cluster suppressing the formation of ribosome queues upstream of the second cluster, thereby decreasing the opportunities for translation-dependent degradation machinery, such as the Dhh1p protein, to interact with stalled ribosomes. We also find in the model that in the presence of two slow codon clusters the cluster closest to 5'-end is the primary determinant of mRNA half-life. These results identify two of the rules governing the influence of slow codon clusters on mRNA half-life, demonstrate that multiple slow codon clusters can have synergistic effects, and indicate that codon usage bias can play a more nuanced role in controlling cellular protein levels than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "To overwinter, insects from mild temperate areas can either enter diapause or remain active. Both strategies involve costs and benefits depending on the environment. In the first case, the emerging individuals will resist winter but have a reduced fitness because diapause entails physiological and ecological costs. In the second case, individuals need to be cold-resistant enough to withstand winter temperatures during their immature and adult stages, but could avoid diapause-associated costs. In mild temperate areas, the cost-benefit balance between the diapause and the non-diapause strategy would likely change in response to climate warming. A trade-off between these two strategies should lead to reduction of diapause expression in some populations. We explored the importance of such trade-off through the comparison of cold resistance capacities among different life stages in diapause and non-diapause individuals in a population of the aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) originating from western France where a decrease of diapause incidence was recently observed. As a proxy measure of insect physiological cold resistance, the Super Cooling Point (SCP) was determined for non-diapausing and diapausing prepupae and adults that went through prepupal diapause or not. Diapausing and non-diapausing prepupae were equally cold-resistant (-24.20 {+/-}0.30{degrees}C vs. -24.74 {+/-}0.36{degrees}C, respectively), and overall more resistant than adults. Adults that went through diapause as prepupae were less cold resistant (-17.85 {+/-}1.10{degrees}C) than adults that have not undergone through diapause (-21.10 {+/-}0.54{degrees}C). We also found that diapausing prepupae and adults that have undergone diapause were lighter than their non-diapausing counterparts, at a comparable size, suggesting higher energetic expenses during diapause. These results suggest a trade-off between diapause expression in prepupae and cold resistance and life-history-traits in adults. We conclude that selection could favor insects that do not enter diapause and thus avoid its associated costs while taking advantage at exploiting the mild winter environment.",

    "abstract": "Discrete stochastic models of gene regulatory network models are indispensable tools for biological inquiry since they allow the modeler to predict how molecular interactions give rise to nonlinear system output. Model exploration with the objective of generating qualitative hypotheses about the workings of a pathway is usually the first step in the modeling process. It involves simulating the gene network model under a very large range of conditions, due to the the large uncertainty in interactions and kinetic parameters. This makes model exploration highly computational demanding. Furthermore, with no prior information about the model behavior, labour-intensive manual inspection of very large amounts of simulation results becomes necessary. This limits systematic computational exploration to simplistic models. We address this by developing an interactive, smart workflow for model exploration based on semi-supervised learning and human-in-the-loop labeling of data. The proposed methodology lets a modeler rapidly discover ranges of interesting behaviors predicted by a model. Utilizing the notion that similar simulation output is in proximity of each other in feature space, the modeler can focus on informing the system about what behaviors are more interesting than others instead of configuring and analyzing simulation results. This large reduction in time-consuming manual work by the modeler early in a modeling project can substantially reduce the time needed to go from an initial model to testable predictions and downstream analysis.",
