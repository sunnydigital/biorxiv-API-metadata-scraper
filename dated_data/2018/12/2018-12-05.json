    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify genetic variants associated with quantitative traits or disease. Thus, GWAS never directly link variants to regulatory mechanisms, which, in turn, are typically inferred during post-hoc analyses. In parallel, a recent deep learning-based method allows for prediction of regulatory effects per variant on currently up to 1,000 cell type-specific chromatin features. We here describe \\\"DeepWAS\\\", a new approach that directly integrates predictions of these regulatory effects of single variants into a multivariate GWAS setting. As a result, single variants associated with a trait or disease are, by design, coupled to their impact on a chromatin feature in a cell type. Up to 40,000 regulatory single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with multiple sclerosis (MS, 4,888 cases and 10,395 controls), major depressive disorder (MDD, 1,475 cases and 2,144 controls), and height (5,974 individuals) to each identify 43-61 regulatory SNPs, called deepSNPs, which are shown to reach at least nominal significance in large GWAS. MS- and height-specific deepSNPs resided in active chromatin and introns, whereas MDD-specific deepSNPs located mostly to intragenic regions and repressive chromatin states. We found deepSNPs to be enriched in public or cohort-matched expression and methylation quantitative trait loci and demonstrate the potential of the DeepWAS method to directly generate testable functional hypotheses based on genotype data alone. DeepWAS is an innovative GWAS approach with the power to identify individual SNPs in non-coding regions with gene regulatory capacity with a joint contribution to disease risk.

    "abstract": "The antimicrobial triclosan is used in a wide range of consumer products ranging from toothpaste, cleansers, socks, and baby toys. A bacteriostatic inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis, triclosan is extremely stable and accumulates in the environment. Approximately 75% of adults in the US have detectable levels of the compound in their urine, with a sizeable fraction of individuals (>10%) having urine concentrations equal to or greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration for Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Previous work has identified connections between defects in fatty acid synthesis and accumulation of the alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), which has been repeatedly associated with antibiotic tolerance and persistence. Based on these data, we hypothesized that triclosan exposure may inadvertently drive bacteria into a state in which they are able to tolerate normally lethal concentrations of antibiotics. Here we report that clinically relevant concentrations of triclosan increased E. coli and MRSA tolerance to bactericidal antibiotics as much as 10,000 fold in vitro and reduced antibiotic efficacy up to 100-fold in a mouse urinary tract infection model. Genetic analysis indicated that triclosan-mediated antibiotic tolerance requires ppGpp synthesis, but is independent of growth. These data highlight an unexpected and certainly unintended consequence of adding high concentrations of antimicrobials in consumer products, supporting an urgent need to reevaluate the costs and benefits of the prophylactic use of triclosan and other bacteriostatic compounds.\\n\\nImportanceAdded as a prophylactic to a wide range of consumer products, the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor triclosan accumulates to high levels in humans and the environment. Based on links between defects in fatty acid synthesis and accumulation of the alarmone ppGpp, we hypothesized that triclosan would render cells tolerant to bactericidal compounds due to ppGpp-mediated inhibition of biosynthetic capacity. Our data indicate that clinically relevant concentrations of triclosan induces higher tolerance of E. coli and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) to a panel of bactericidal antibiotics up to 10,000-fold. In a urinary tract infection model, mice exposed to triclosan exhibited bacterial loads ~100-fold higher in the bladder than control animals following ciprofloxacin challenge. These findings highlight an unexpected consequence of antimicrobials in consumer products and support an urgent need to reevaluate the costs and benefits of the prophylactic use of triclosan and other bacteriostatic compounds.",

    "abstract": "Reward and punishment shape behavior, but the mechanisms underlying their effect on skill learning are not well understood. Here, we tested whether the functional connectivity of premotor cortex (PMC), a region known to be critical for learning of sequencing skills, is altered after training by reward or punishment given during training. Resting-state fMRI was collected in two experiments before and after participants trained on either a serial reaction time task (SRTT; n = 36) or force-tracking task (FTT; n = 36) with reward, punishment, or control feedback. In each experiment, training-related change in PMC functional connectivity was compared across feedback groups. In both tasks, reward and punishment differentially affected PMC functional connectivity. On the SRTT, participants trained with reward showed an increase in functional connectivity between PMC and cerebellum as well as PMC and striatum, while participants trained with punishment showed an increase in functional connectivity between PMC and medial temporal lobe connectivity. After training on the FTT, subjects trained with control and reward showed increases in PMC connectivity with parietal and temporal cortices after training, while subjects trained with punishment showed increased PMC connectivity with ventral striatum. While the results from the two experiments overlapped in some areas, including ventral pallidum, temporal lobe, and cerebellum, these regions showed diverging patterns of results across the two tasks for the different feedback conditions. These findings suggest that reward and punishment strongly influence spontaneous brain activity after training, and that the regions implicated depend on the task learned.",

    "abstract": "Piezo channels transduce mechanical stimuli into electrical and chemical signals, and in doing so, powerfully influence development, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration. While much is known about how Piezo1 responds to external forces, its response to internal, cell-generated forces remains poorly understood. Here, using measurements of endogenous Piezo1 activity and traction forces in native cellular conditions, we show that actomyosin-based cellular traction forces generate spatially-restricted Ca2+ flickers in the absence of externally-applied mechanical forces. Although Piezo1 channels diffuse readily in the plasma membrane and are widely distributed across the cell, their flicker activity is enriched in regions proximal to force-producing adhesions. The mechanical force that activates Piezo1 arises from Myosin II phosphorylation by Myosin Light Chain Kinase. We propose that Piezo1 Ca2+ flickers allow spatial segregation of mechanotransduction events, and that diffusion allows channel molecules to efficiently respond to transient, local mechanical stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing protocols have dramatically increased the throughput and efficiency of single-cell transcriptomics studies. A key computational challenge when processing these data is to distinguish libraries for real cells from empty droplets. Existing methods for cell calling set a minimum threshold on the total unique molecular identifier (UMI) count for each library, which indiscriminately discards cell libraries with low UMI counts. Here, we describe a new statistical method for calling cells from droplet-based data, based on detecting significant deviations from the expression profile of the ambient solution. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our method has greater power than existing approaches for detecting cell libraries with low UMI counts, while controlling the false discovery rate among detected cells. We also apply our method to real data, where we show that the use of our method results in the retention of distinct cell types that would otherwise have been discarded.",

    "abstract": "Genomic data allow an in-depth and renewed study of local adaptation. The red coral (Corallium rubrum, Cnidaria) is a highly genetically structured species and a promising model for the study of adaptive processes along an environmental gradient. Here, we used RAD-Sequencing in order to study the vertical genetic structure of this species and to search for signals of local adaptation to depth and thermal regime in the red coral. Previous studies have shown different thermotolerance levels according to depth in this species which could correspond to genetic or environmental differences. We designed a sampling scheme with six pairs of  shallow vs deep populations distributed in three geographical regions as replicates. Our results showed significant differentiation among locations and among sites separated by around 20 m depth. The tests of association between genetics and environment allowed the identification of candidate loci under selection but with a potentially high rate of false positive. We discuss the methodological obstacles and biases encountered for the detection of selected loci in such a strongly genetically structured species. On this basis, we also discuss the significance of the candidate loci for local adaptation detected in each geographical region and the evolution of red coral populations along environmental gradients.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/306456_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (110K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11d6129org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d604c3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d2bef2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f64160_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG A colony of red coral, Corallium rubrum, near Marseille.

    "abstract": "E-cadherin is a major cell-cell adhesion molecule involved in mechanotransduction at cell-cell contacts in tissues. Since epithelial cells respond to rigidity and tension in the tissue through E-cadherin, there must be active processes that test and respond to the mechanical properties of these adhesive contacts. Using sub-micrometer, E-cadherin-coated PDMS pillars, we find that cells generate local contractions between E-cadherin adhesions and pull to a constant distance for a constant duration, irrespective of pillar rigidity. These cadherin contractions require non-muscle myosin IIB, tropomyosin 2.1, -catenin and binding of vinculin to -catenin; plus, they are correlated with rigidity-dependent cell spreading. Without contractions, cells fail to spread to different areas on soft and rigid surfaces and to maintain monolayer integrity. We further observe that cadherin contractions enable cells to test myosin IIA-mediated tension of neighboring cells, and sort out myosin IIA-depleted cells. Thus, we suggest that epithelial cells test and respond to the mechanical characteristics of neighboring cells through cadherin contractions.",

    "abstract": "The association between the upregulated Notch and FSH signaling and ovarian cancer is well documented. However, their signaling has been investigated independently and only in the primary tumor tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the interactive effects of FSH and Notch signaling on the ovarian cancer proliferation, formation and maintenance of the disseminated ovarian cancer cells. Roles of Notch and FSH in the ovarian cancer pathogenesis was investigated using ovarian cancer cell lines and specific antibodies against Notch and FSH receptor (FSHR). FSH upregulated Notch signaling and proliferation in the ovarian cancer cells. High levels of FSH were detected in the ascites of patients with serous ovarian adenocarcinoma. The spheroids from the ascites of the patients, as well as, the spheroids from the ovarian cancer cell lines under low attachment culture conditions, expressed FSH{beta} subunit mRNAs and secreted the hormone into the medium. In contrast, the primary ovarian tumor tissues and cell line monolayers expressed very low levels of FSH{beta}. The ovarian cancer cell spheroids also exhibited higher expression of the FSH receptor and Notch downstream genes than their monolayer counterparts. A combination of FSHR and Notch antagonistic antibodies significantly inhibited spheroid formation and cell proliferation in vitro. This study demonstrates that spheroids in ascites express and secrete FSH, which regulates cancer cell proliferation and spheroidogenesis through Notch signaling, suggesting that FSH is an autocrine regulator of cancer metastasis. Further, Notch and FSHR are potential immunotherapeutic targets for ovarian cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Roots are the main channel for water and nutrient uptake in plants. Optimisation of root architecture provides a viable strategy to improve nutrient and water uptake efficiency and maintain crop productivity under water-limiting and nutrient-poor conditions. We know little, however, about the genetic control of root development in wheat, a crop supplying 20% of global calorie and protein intake. To improve our understanding of the genetic control of seminal root development in wheat, we conducted a high-throughput screen for variation in seminal root number using an exome-sequenced mutant population derived from the hexaploid wheat cultivar Cadenza. The screen identified seven independent mutants with homozygous and stably altered seminal root number phenotypes. One mutant, Cadenza0900, displays a recessive extra seminal root number phenotype, while six mutants (Cadenza0062, Cadenza0369, Cadenza0393, Cadenza0465, Cadenza0818 and Cadenza1273) show lower seminal root number phenotypes most likely originating from defects in the formation and activation of seminal root primordia. Segregation analysis in F2 populations suggest that the phenotype of Cadenza0900 is controlled by multiple loci whereas the Cadenza0062 phenotype fits a 3:1 mutant:wild-type segregation ratio characteristic of dominant single gene action. This work highlights the potential to use the sequenced wheat mutant population as a forward genetic resource to uncover novel variation in agronomic traits, such as seminal root architecture.",

At the core of RNA-dependent mRNA amplification, until now only described in one mammalian system, is the self-priming of an antisense strand and extension of its 3 terminus into a sense-oriented RNA containing the protein-coding information of a conventional mRNA. The resulting product constitutes a new type of biomolecule. It is chimeric in that it contains covalently connected antisense and sense sequences in a hairpin configuration. Cleavage of this chimeric intermediate in the loop region of a hairpin structure releases mRNA which contains an antisense segment in its 5UTR; depending on the position of self-priming, the chimeric end product may encode the entire protein or its C-terminal fragment. The occurrence of such composite chimeric molecules is unique for this type of mRNA amplification and represents a conclusive \\\"identifier\\\" of this process. We report here the detection, by next generation sequencing, of such chimeric junction sequences for mRNAs molecules encoding l, {beta}1, and {gamma}1 chains of laminin in cells of the extracellular matrix-generating Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) mouse tumor, best known for producing extraordinarily large amounts of \\\"Matrigel\\\".",

    "abstract": "An accurate estimate of limb position is necessary for movement planning, before and after motor learning. Where we localize our unseen hand after a reach depends on felt hand position, or proprioception, but in studies and theories on motor adaptation this is quite often neglected in favour of predicted sensory consequences based on efference copies of motor commands. Both sources of information should contribute, so here we set out to further investigate how much of hand localization depends on proprioception and how much on predicted sensory consequences. We use a training paradigm combining robot controlled hand movements with rotated visual feedback that eliminates the possibility to update predicted sensory consequences ( exposure training), but still recalibrates proprioception, as well as a classic training paradigm with self-generated movements in another set of participants. After each kind of training we measure participants hand location estimates based on both efference-based predictions and afferent proprioceptive signals with self-generated hand movements ( active localization) as well as based on proprioception only with robot-generated movements ( passive localization). In the exposure training group, we find indistinguishable shifts in passive and active hand localization, but after classic training, active localization shifts more than passive, indicating a contribution from updated predicted sensory consequences. Both changes in open-loop reaches and hand localization are only slightly smaller after exposure training as compared to after classic training, confirming that proprioception plays a large role in estimating limb position and in planning movements, even after adaptation.

Given unilateral stroke, this would lead to a prediction of men having higher aphasia rates than women. Another line of observations suggest that women are more severely affected by stroke, which could lead to a higher aphasia rate among women. An additional potential confounding variable could be age, given that women are typically older at the time of stroke.\\n\\nMethods & ProceduresThis study consists of two parts. First, a meta-analysis of the available reports of aphasia rates in the two sexes was conducted. A comprehensive literature search yielded 25 studies with sufficient information about both aphasia and gender. These studies included a total of 48,362 stroke patients for which aphasia rates were calculated. Second, data were extracted from an American health database (with 1,967,038 stroke patients), in order to include age and stroke severity into a regression analysis of sex differences in aphasia rates.\\n\\nOutcomes & ResultsBoth analyses revealed significantly larger aphasia rates in women than in men (1.1-1.14 ratio). This speaks against the idea that men should be more lateralized in their language function. When age and stroke severity were included as covariates, sex failed to explain any aphasia rate sex difference above and beyond that which is explained by age differences at time of stroke.",

Anterograde tract-tracer techniques also highlighted the parahippocampal origins of DHC fibers in nonhuman primates. Finally, we derived Diffusion Tensor MRI (DT-MRI) metrics from the DHC in a large sample of human subjects to investigate whether inter-individual variation in DHC microstructure is predictive of memory performance. The mean diffusivity of the DHC was correlated with performance in a standardised episodic memory task; an effect that was not reproduced in a comparison commissure tract - the anterior commissure. These findings highlight a role for the DHC in episodic memory, and our tract reconstruction approach has the potential to generate further novel insights into the role of this previously understudied white matter tract in both health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Rapid identification of bacterial pathogens is crucial for appropriate and adequate antibiotic treatment, which significantly improves patient outcomes. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing has proven to be a powerful strategy for diagnosing bacterial infections. We have recently established a sequencing method and bioinformatics pipeline for 16S rRNA gene analysis utilizing the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencer. In combination with our taxonomy annotation analysis pipeline, the system enabled the molecular detection of bacterial DNA in a reasonable timeframe for diagnostic purposes. However, purification of bacterial DNA from specimens remains a rate-limiting step in the workflow. To further accelerate the process of sample preparation, we adopted a direct PCR strategy that amplifies 16S rRNA genes from bacterial cell suspensions without DNA purification. Our results indicate that differences in cell wall morphology significantly affect direct PCR efficiency and sequencing data. Notably, mechanical cell disruption preceding direct PCR was indispensable for obtaining an accurate representation of the specimen bacterial composition. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene analysis of mock polymicrobial samples indicated that primer sequence optimization is required to avoid preferential detection of particular taxa and to cover a broad range of bacterial species. This study establishes a relatively simple workflow for rapid bacterial identification via MinIONTM sequencing, which reduces the turnaround time from sample to result, and provides a reliable method that may be applicable to clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is thought to play an essential role during egress of malaria parasites because the ER is assumed to be the calcium (Ca2+) signaling hub and required for biogenesis of egress-related organelles. However, no proteins localized to the parasite ER have been shown to play a role in egress of malaria parasites. In this study, we generated conditional mutants of the Plasmodium falciparum Endoplasmic Reticulum-resident Calcium-binding protein (PfERC), a member of the CREC family. Knockdown of PfERC shows that this gene is essential for asexual growth of P. falciparum. Analysis of the intraerythrocytic lifecycle revealed that PfERC is essential for parasite egress but not required for protein trafficking or Ca2+ storage. We found that PfERC knockdown prevents the rupture of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. This is because PfERC knockdown inhibited the proteolytic maturation of the subtilisin-like serine protease, SUB1. Using double mutant parasites, we show that PfERC is required for the proteolytic maturation of the essential aspartic protease, Plasmepsin X, which cleaves SUB1. Further, we show that processing of substrates downstream of the proteolytic cascade is inhibited by PfERC knockdown. Thus, these data establish the ER-resident CREC family protein, PfERC, as a key early regulator of the egress proteolytic cascade of malaria parasites.",

In this study, we performed single-base-resolution bisulfite sequencing together with RNA-seq to explore the genetic basis of embryonic muscle development in chicken. Comparison of methylome profiles between broilers and laying hens revealed that lower methylation in broilers might contribute to muscle development. Differential methylated region (DMR) analysis between two chicken lines showed that the majority of DMRs were hypo-DMRs for broilers. Differential methylated genes were significantly enriched in muscle development-related terms at E13 and E19. Furthermore, by constructing the network of the lncRNAs, we identified a lncRNA, which we named MYH1-AS, that potentially regulated muscle development. These findings reveal an integrative landscape of late period of embryonic myogenesis in chicken and give rise to a comprehensive understanding of epigenetic and transcriptional regulation, in skeletal muscle development.

Chloroplasts trigger retrograde signals that control alternative splicing in leaves and roots in response to light. Here we provide evidence suggesting that sugars, derived from photosynthesis, act as mobile signals controlling alternative splicing in roots. The inhibition of TOR kinase activity diminishes the alternative splicing response to light and/or sugars in roots, showing the relevance of the TOR pathway in this signaling mechanism. Furthermore, disrupting the function of the mitochondria abolishes alternative splicing changes supporting a key role for these organelles in this signaling axis. We conclude that sugars can act as mobile signals coordinating alternative splicing responses to light throughout the whole plant, exerting this function in roots by activating the TOR pathway.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/472126v2_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (76K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a8c978org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1430da0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1339990org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a6dd5a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Art by Dr. Luciana Giono.",

    "abstract": "Drug combinations have demonstrated high efficacy and low adverse side effects compared to single drug administrations in cancer therapies, and thus draw intensive attentions from researchers and pharmaceutical enterprises. Thanks to the fast development of high-throughput screening (HTS) methods, the amount of available drug combination datasets has tremendously increased. However, existing drug combination databases are lack of indications of the drug combinations and quantitative dose-responses. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive database that is crucial to both experimental and computational screening of drug combinations. In this paper, we present DrugCombDB, a comprehensive database dedicated to integrating drug combinations from various data sources. Concretely, the data sources include 1) high-throughput screening assays of drug combinations, 2) external databases, and 3) manual curations from PubMed literature. In total, DrugCombDB includes 1,127,969 experimental data points with quantitative dose response and concentrations of drug combinations covering 561 unique drugs and 104 human cancer cell lines, and 1,875 FDA approved or literature-supported drug combinations. In particular, we adopted the zero interaction potency (ZIP) model [2] to compute the scores determining the synergy or antagonism of two drugs. To facilitate the downstream usage of our data resource, we prepared multiple datasets that are ready for building prediction models of classification and regression analysis. A website with user-friendly data visualization is provided to help users access the wealth of data. Users can input a drug of interest to retrieve associated drug combinations, together with the supporting evidence sources and drug targets.

    "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a state of unrelenting seizure activity. It is associated with a rapidly rising mortality rate, and thus constitutes a medical emergency. Benzodiazepines, which act as positive modulators of chloride (Cl-) permeable GABAA receptors, are indicated as the first line of treatment, but this is ineffective in many cases. We found that 48% of children presenting with SE were unresponsive to benzodiazepine treatment, and critically, that the duration of SE at the time of treatment is an important predictor of non-responsiveness. We therefore investigated the cellular mechanisms that underlie acquired benzodiazepine resistance, using rodent organotypic brain slices. Removing Mg2+ ions leads to an evolving pattern of epileptiform activity, and eventually to a persistent state of repetitive discharges that strongly resembles clinical EEG recordings of SE. We show that the persistent SE-like activity is associated with a reduction in GABAA receptor conductance and Cl- extrusion capability. We explored the effect on intraneuronal Cl- using both gramicidin, perforated-patch clamp recordings and Cl- imaging. This showed that during SE-like activity, reduced Cl- extrusion capacity was further exacerbated by activity-dependent Cl- loading, resulting in a persistently high intraneuronal Cl-. Consistent with these results, we found that optogenetic stimulation of GABAergic interneurons in the SE-like state, actually enhanced epileptiform activity in a GABAAR dependent manner. Together our findings describe a novel potential mechanism underlying benzodiazepine-resistant SE, with relevance to how this life-threatening condition should be managed in the clinic.",

Here we applied an imaging-based RNAi phenotypic cell migration screen using two highly migratory basal breast cancer cell lines (Hs578T and MDA-MB-231) to provide a repository for signaling determinants that functionally drive cancer cell migration. We screened ~4,200 individual target genes covering most cell signaling components and discovered 133 and 113 migratory modulators of Hs578T and MDA-MB-231, respectively, of which 43 genes were common denominators of cell migration. Interaction networks of candidate migratory modulators were in common with networks of different clinical breast cancer prognostic and metastasis classifiers. The splicing factors PRPF4B and BUD31 and the transcription factor BPTF were amplified in human primary breast tumors and the expression was associated with metastasis-free survival. Depletion of PRPF4B, BUD31 and BPTF caused primarily down-regulation of genes involved in focal adhesion and ECM-interaction pathways. PRPF4B was essential for triple negative breast cancer cell migration and critical for breast cancer metastasis formation in vivo, making PRPF4B a candidate for further drug development. Our systematic phenotypic screen provides an important repository of candidate metastasis drug targets.",

    "abstract": "SignificanceThe root microbiome composition is largely determined by the soil inoculum, with a distinct contribution from the host. Yet, the molecular mechanisms with which the host influences its rhizobiome are only beginning to be discovered. Using a hydroponics-based synthetic community approach, we probe the impact of root-exuded specialized metabolites in shaping the root microbiome. We uncover a role for coumarins in structuring the rhizobiome, particularly by limiting the growth of a Pseudomonas strain, for which we propose a mechanism of action. Our findings support the exciting possibility that root-exuded coumarins form a part of the plants adaptive response to iron deficiency that goes beyond iron mobilization to modulate the rhizobiome, and highlights avenues towards engineering the rhizosphere for plant health.\\n\\nAbstractThe factors that dictate the composition of the root microbiome and its role in plant fitness has been a long-standing question. Recent work has highlighted a major contribution of the soil inoculum in determining the composition of the root microbiome. However, plants are known to conditionally exude a diverse array of unique secondary metabolites, largely varying between species and environmental conditions. Here, we explore the role of specialized metabolites in dictating which bacteria reside in the rhizosphere. We employed a reduced synthetic community (SynCom) of Arabidopsis thaliana root-isolated bacteria to detect community shifts that occur in the absence of the secreted small molecule phytoalexins, flavonoids, and coumarins. We find that lack of coumarin biosynthesis in f6h1 mutant plant lines causes a shift in the root microbial community specifically under iron deficiency. We demonstrate a potential role for iron-mobilizing coumarins in sculpting the A. thaliana root bacterial community by inhibiting the proliferation of a relatively abundant Pseudomonas species via a redox-mediated mechanism. This work establishes a systematic approach enabling elucidation of specific mechanisms by which plant-derived molecules mediate microbial community composition. Our findings expand on the function of conditionally-exuded specialized metabolites and lead to new avenues to effectively engineer the rhizosphere for improving crop growth in alkaline soils, which make up a third of total arable soils.",

ASD risk is thought to arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, with the perinatal period as a critical window. Understanding early transcriptional changes in ASD would assist in clarifying disease pathogenesis and identifying biomarkers and treatments. However, little is known about umbilical cord blood gene expression profiles in babies later diagnosed with ASD compared to non-typically developing (Non-TD) or neurotypical children.\\n\\nMethodsGenome-wide transcript levels were measured by Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 array in RNA from umbilical cord blood samples from both the Markers of Autism Risk in Babies--Learning Early Signs (MARBLES) and the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) high-risk pregnancy cohorts that enroll younger siblings of a child previously diagnosed with ASD. An algorithm-based diagnosis from 36 month assessments categorized the younger sibling as either ASD, typically developing (TD), or not ASD but non-typically developing (Non-TD). 59 ASD, 92 Non-TD, and 120 TD subjects were included and differences were identified in ASD versus TD subjects, with Non-TD versus TD as a specificity control. Meta-analysis was used to combine the results from both studies. Functional enrichments of differentially-expressed genes were examined across diagnostic groups.\\n\\nResultsWhile cord blood gene expression differences comparing either ASD or Non-TD to TD did not reach genome-wide significance when adjusting for multiple comparisons, 172 genes were nominally differentially-expressed between ASD and TD cord blood (log2(fold change) > 0.1, p < 0.01). These genes were significantly enriched for toxic substance response and xenobiotic metabolism functions, and gene sets involved in chromatin regulation and systemic lupus erythematosus were significantly upregulated (FDR q < 0.05). In contrast, 66 genes were differentially-expressed between Non-TD and TD cord blood, including only 8 genes that were also differentially-expressed in ASD.\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first study to identify perinatal gene expression differences in umbilical cord blood specific to ASD. The results of this meta-analysis across two prospective ASD cohorts support involvement of environmental, immune, and epigenetic mechanisms in ASD etiology.",

To gain a better insight into the knowledge we already have, we explored how key topics in coral disease research have been related to each other using network analysis. We reviewed 719 papers and conference proceedings published from 1965 to 2017. From each study, four elements determined our network nodes: 1) studied disease(s); 2) host genus; 3) marine ecoregion(s) associated with the study site; and 4) research objectives. Basic properties of this network confirmed that there is a set of specific topics comprising the majority of research. The top five diseases, genera, and ecoregions studied accounted for over 48% of the research effort in all cases. The community structure analysis identified 15 clusters of topics with different degrees of overlap among them. These clusters represent the typical sets of elements that appear together for a given study. Our results show that while some coral diseases have been studied considering multiple aspects, the overall trend is for most diseases to be understood under a limited range of approaches, e.g. bacterial assemblages have been considerably studied in Yellow and Black band diseases while immune response has been better examined for the aspergillosis-Gorgonia system. Thus, our challenge in the near future is to identify and resolve potential gaps in order to achieve a more comprehensive progress on coral disease research.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of whole genome has revealed specific geographical distribution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains across the globe suggestive of unique host dependent adaptive mechanisms in Mtb evolved out of selective pressures. We provide an important correlation of a genome-based mutation to a molecular phenotype across two predominant clinical Mtb lineages of the Indian subcontinent. We have identified a distinct lineage specific mutation-G247C, translating into an alanine to proline conversion in the papA2 gene of Indo oceanic lineage 1 [L1] Mtb strains; restoration of cell wall sulfolipids by simple genetic complementation of papA2 from lineage 3 [L3] or from H37Rv (Lineage 4-L4) attributed the loss of this glycolipid to this specific mutation in Indo oceanic L1 Mtb. Investigation into the structure of Mtb PapA2 revealed a distinct non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) C domain conformation with an unconventional presence of Zinc binding motif. Surprisingly, the A83P mutation did not map to either the catalytic centre in the N-terminal subdomain or any of the substrate binding region of the protein. On the contrary, the inherent ability of mutant PapA2 to form insoluble aggregates and molecular simulations with the Wt/ mut PapA2 purports an important role for the surface associated 83rd residue in protein conformation. The present study demonstrates the importance of a critical structural residue in the papA2 protein of Mtb and helps establish a link between observed genomic alteration and its molecular consequence in the successful human pathogen Mtb.",

To explore this, we implanted microelectrodes into the VTCs of eight human subjects undergoing invasive epilepsy monitoring. Most (26 of 33) category-selective units showed specificity for face stimuli, with a range of response profiles. Different face exemplars evoked consistent and discriminable responses in the population of units sampled.

    "abstract": "Plant development requires communication on many levels, including between cells and between organelles within a cell. For example, mitochondria and plastids have been proposed to be sensors of environmental stress and to coordinate their responses. Here we present evidence for communication between mitochondria and chloroplasts during leaf and root development, based on genetic and physical interactions between three Mechanosensitive channels of Small conductance-Like (MSL) proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana. MSL proteins are Arabidopsis homologs of the bacterial Mechanosensitive channel of Small conductance (MscS), which relieves cellular osmotic pressure to protect against lysis during hypoosmotic shock. MSL1 localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane, while MSL2 and MSL3 localize to the inner plastid membrane and are required to maintain plastid osmotic homeostasis during normal growth and development. In this study, we characterized the phenotypic effect of a genetic lesion in MSL1, both in wild type and in msl2 msl3 mutant backgrounds. msl1 single mutants appear wild type for all phenotypes examined. The characteristic leaf rumpling in msl2 msl3 double mutants was exacerbated in the msl1 msl2 msl3 triple mutant. However, the introduction of the msl1 lesion into the msl2 msl3 mutant background suppressed other msl2 msl3 mutant phenotypes, including ectopic callus formation, accumulation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in the shoot apical meristem, decreased root length, and reduced number of lateral roots. All these phenotypes could be recovered by molecular complementation with a transgene containing a wild type version of MSL1. In yeast-based interaction studies, MSL1 interacted with itself, but not with MSL2 or MSL3. These results establish that the abnormalities observed in msl2 msl3 double mutants is partially dependent on the presence of functional MSL1 and suggest a possible role for communication between plastid and mitochondria in seedling development.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) make up half of mammalian genomes and shape genome regulation by harboring binding sites for regulatory factors. These include architectural proteins--such as CTCF, RAD21 and SMC3--that are involved in tethering chromatin loops and marking domain boundaries. The 3D organization of the mammalian genome is intimately linked to its function and is remarkably conserved. However, the mechanisms by which these structural intricacies emerge and evolve have not been thoroughly probed. Here we show that TEs contribute extensively to both the formation of species-specific loops in humans and mice via deposition of novel anchoring motifs, as well as to the maintenance of conserved loops across both species via CTCF binding site turnover. The latter function demonstrates the ability of TEs to contribute to genome plasticity and reinforce conserved genome architecture as redundant loop anchors. Deleting such candidate TEs in human cells leads to a collapse of such conserved loop and domain structures. These TEs are also marked by reduced DNA methylation and bear mutational signatures of hypomethylation through evolutionary time. TEs have long been considered a source of genetic innovation; by examining their contribution to genome topology, we show that TEs can contribute to regulatory plasticity by inducing redundancy and potentiating genetic drift locally while conserving genome architecture globally, revealing a paradigm for defining regulatory conservation in the noncoding genome beyond classic sequence-level conservation.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryCo-option of transposable elements maintains conserved 3D genome structures via CTCF binding site turnover in human and mouse.",

The advent of genome editing via a Cas9-induced DNA double-strand break has intensified interest in understanding cellular responses to DNA damage. Here we find that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by Cas9 or other damaging agents lead to a reduction of core ribosomal proteins, RPS27A and RPL40, and that the loss of these proteins is post-transcriptional and p53-independent. DSBs furthermore lead to the shutdown of translation through phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha, and altering these signals affects genome editing outcomes. This DSB translational response is widespread and precedes the transcriptional response. Our results demonstrate that even a single double-strand break can lead to ribosome remodeling and reduced translational output, and suggest caution in interpreting cellular phenotypes measured immediately after genome editing.",

The StW 573 antebrachium exhibits bilateral asymmetry, with significantly more longitudinally curved left forearm bones than right. Arguing from a comparative perspective, we hypothesize that these curvatures resulted from a fall onto a hyperextended, outstretched hand. It is unlikely that the fall was from a significant height and might have occurred when the StW 573 individual was a juvenile. This type of plastic deformation of the forearm bones is well-documented in modern human clinical studies, especially among children between the ages of four and ten years who tumble from bicycles or suffer other common, relatively low-impact accidents. Left untreated, such injuries impinge normal supination and pronation of the hand, a condition that could have had significant behavioral impact on the StW 573 individual.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic silencing of transgenes has been a persistent challenge for mammalian cell engineering. Foreign DNA can be incorporated into closed chromatin before and after it has been integrated into a host cells genome. To identify elements that mitigate epigenetic silencing, we tested components from the c-myb and NF-kB transcriptional regulation systems in transiently transfected DNA and at chromosomally integrated transgenes in PC-3 and HEK293 cells. DNA binding sites for MYB (c-myb) placed upstream of a minimal promoter strongly enhanced expression from transiently transfected plasmid DNA. We targeted p65 and MYB fusion proteins to chromosomal transgenes that were silenced by ectopic Polycomb chromatin or by uncharacterized endogenous chromatin. Transient expression of Gal4-MYB induced sustained activation of the Polycomb-silenced UAS-Tk-luciferase transgene. We used custom guide RNAs and dCas9-MYB to target MYB to different sites. Transgene activation within ectopic Polycomb chromatin required proximity of dCas9-MYB to the transcriptional start site, while activation at the naturally repressed transgene was position-independent. Our report is the first to demonstrate the use of MYB in the context of the CRISPR-activation system. The results demonstrate that DNA elements and fusion proteins derived from c-myb can mitigate epigenetic silencing to improve transgene expression in engineered cell lines.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural management should consider multiple services and stakeholders. Yet, it remains unclear how to guarantee the provision of ecosystem services that reaches stakeholders demands, especially considering the observed biodiversity decline and the current global change predictions that may affect food security. Here, we use a model to examine how landscape composition - fraction of semi-natural habitat (SNH) - affects biodiversity and crop production services in intensively-managed agricultural systems. We analyse three groups of stakeholders assumed to value different ecosystem services most - individual farmers (crop yield per area), agricultural unions (landscape production) and conservationists (biodiversity). We find that trade-offs among stakeholders demands strongly depend on the degree of pollination dependence of crops, the strength of environmental and demographic stochasticity, and the relative amount of an ecosystem service demanded by each stakeholder, i.e. function thresholds. Intermediate amounts of SNH can allow for the delivery of relatively high levels of the three ecosystem services. Our analysis further suggests that the current levels of SNH protection lie below these intermediate amounts of SNH in intensively-managed agricultural landscapes. Given the worldwide trends in agriculture and global change, these results suggest ways of managing landscapes to reconcile the demands of several actors and ensure for biodiversity conservation and food production.",

The physical association of the two organisms was confirmed with genome-informed fluorescence in situ hybridization depicting small cocci of Ca. H. crystalense attached to Ca. A. hamiconexum cells. Based on genomic information, Ca. H. crystalense has a similar metabolism as Nanoarchaeum equitans and potentially scavenges vitamins, sugars, nucleotides, and reduced redox-equivalents from its host. These results provide insight into host-symbiont interactions among members of two uncultivated archaeal phyla that thrive in a deep subsurface aquifer.",

We here report genome wide DNA data for 12 ancient samples (0.02x-1.28x) from China ranging from 6500 to 2500 years before present (YBP). They belonged to 4 different genetic groups, designated as Dashanqian (DSQ) of Xiajiadian Culture in the Northeast, Banpo (BP) of middle Yangshao Culture in the Central West, Zhengzhou Xishan (ZX) of Miaodigou Culture in the Central Plains, and Others. Present day F5 samples were closer in autosomal distances to the ZX and DSQ groups while F11, C, O1, and O2 samples were closer to the BP group. We also sequenced the Y chromosome of one of these ancient samples K12 from DSQ and found both K12 and a previously reported ~4000 year old sample MG48 from Northwest China to have the O2a2b1a1a1a2a-F2137 haplotype, belonging to the most prolific branch O2a2b1a1a1-F438 immediately under F5.

    "abstract": "The rice genome contains a single G (RGA1) and G{beta} (RGB1) and five G{gamma} subunits. Recent genetic studies have shown that DEP1/qPE9-1, an atypical putative G{gamma} protein, is responsible for dense and erect panicles, but the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying control of grain size are not well understood. Here, we report that plants carrying qPE9-1 have more endosperm cells per grain than plants contain the qpe9-1 allele. The qPE9-1 line has a higher rate and longer period of starch accumulation than the qpe9-1 line. Additionally, the expression of several key genes encoding enzymes catalyzing sucrose metabolism and starch biosynthesis is higher in the qPE9-1 line than in the qpe9-1 line, especially from the mid to late grain-filling stage. Grains of the qPE9-1 line also have higher contents of two phytohormones, ABA and IAA. Exogenous application of ABA or IAA enhanced starch accumulation and the expression of genes encoding grain-filling-related enzymes in the grains of qPE9-1, whereas only IAA produced these effects in qpe9-1. Based on these results, we conclude that qPE9-1 promotes endosperm cell proliferation and positively regulates starch accumulation largely through ABA and IAA, which enhance the expression of genes encoding starch biosynthesis during the late grain-filling stage.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) regulate numerous biochemical processes in cells as (co-)substrates, allosteric modulators, biosynthetic precursors, and signaling molecules1-3. Apart from its roles as energy source fueling cellular biochemistry, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the most abundant NTP in cells, has been reported to affect macromolecular assemblies, such as protein complexes4,5 and membrane-less organelles6-8. Moreover, both ATP and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) have recently been shown to dissolve protein aggregates9. However, system-wide studies to characterize NTP-interactions under conditions approximating the native cellular environment are lacking, which limits our perspective of the diverse physiological roles of NTPs. Here, we have mapped and quantified proteome-wide NTP-interactions by assessing thermal stability and solubility of proteins using mechanically disrupted cells. Our results reveal diverse biological roles of ATP depending on its concentration. We found that ATP specifically interacts with proteins that utilize it as substrate or allosteric modulator at doses lower than 500 M, while it affects protein-protein interactions of protein complexes at mildly higher concentrations (between 1-2 mM). At high concentrations (> 2 mM), ATP modulates the solubility state of a quarter of the insoluble proteome, consisting of positively charged, intrinsically disordered, nucleic acid binding proteins, which are part of membrane-less organelles. The extent of solubilization depends on the localization of proteins to different membrane-less organelles. Furthermore, we uncover that ATP regulates protein-DNA interactions of the Barrier to autointegration factor (BANF1). Our data provides the first quantitative proteome-wide map of ATP affecting protein structure and protein complex stability and solubility, providing unique clues on its role in protein phase transitions.",

    "abstract": "Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is a rare and deadly kidney cancer in patients of African descent with sickle cell trait. Through direct-to-patient outreach, we developed genomically faithful patient-derived models of RMC. Using whole genome sequencing, we identified intronic fusion events in one SMARCB1 allele with concurrent loss of the other allele, confirming that SMARCB1 loss occurs in RMC. Biochemical and functional characterization of these RMC models revealed that RMC depends on the loss of SMARCB1 for survival and functionally resemble other cancers that harbor loss of SMARCB1, such as malignant rhabdoid tumors or atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors. We performed RNAi and CRISPR-Cas9 loss of function genetic screens and a small-molecule screen and identified UBE2C as an essential gene in SMARCB1 deficient cancers. We found that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was essential for the survival of SMARCB1 deficient cancers in vitro and in vivo. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of this pathway leads to G2/M arrest due to constitutive accumulation of cyclin B1. These observations identify a synthetic lethal relationship that may serve as a therapeutic approach for patients with SMARCB1 deficient cancers.",

    "abstract": "Hfq is a ubiquitous Sm-like RNA binding protein in bacteria involved in physiological fitness and pathogenesis, while its in vivo binding natures still remain elusive. Here we reported the first study of the Hfq-bound RNAs map in Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of a kind of plague, by using Cross-Linking Immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (CLIP-Seq) approach. We show that Hfq binds over 80% mRNAs of Y. pestis, and also globally binds non-coding sRNAs encoded by the intergenic, antisense, and the 3 regions of mRNAs. Hfq U-rich stretch is highly enriched in sRNAs, while motifs partially complementary to AGAAUAA and GGGGAUUA are enriched in both mRNAs and sRNAs. Hfq binding motifs are enriched at both terminal sites and in the gene body of mRNAs. Surprisingly, a large fraction of the sRNA and mRNA regions bound by Hfq and those downstream are destabilized, likely via a 5P-activated RNase E degradation pathway and consistent with Hfq-facilitated sRNA-mRNA base-pairing and the coupled degradation in Y. pestis. These results together have presented a high-quality Hfq-RNA interaction map in Y. pestis, which should be important for further deciphering the regulatory role of Hfq-sRNAs in Y. pestis.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYDiscovered in 1968 as an Escherichia coli host factor that was essential for replication of the bacteriophage Q{beta}, the Hfq protein is a ubiquitous and highly abundant RNA binding protein in many bacteria. Under the assistance of Hfq, small RNAs in bacteria play important role in regulating the stability and translation of mRNAs by base-pairing. In this study, we want to elucidate the Hfq assisted sRNA-mRNA regulation in Yersinia pestis. A global map of Hfq interaction sites in Y. pestis was obtained by sequencing of cDNAs converted from the Hfq-bound RNA fragments using UV cross-linking coupled immunoprecipitation technology. We demonstrate that Hfq could hundreds of sRNAs and the majority of mRNAs in living Y. pestis. The enriched binding motifs in sRNAs and mRNA are significantly complementary to each other, suggesting a general base-pairing mechanism for sRNA-mRNA interaction. The Hfq-bound sRNA and mRNA regions were both destabilized. The results suggest that Hfq binding facilitates sRNA-mRNA base-pairing and coordinates their degradation, which might enable Hfq to surveil the hemostasis of most mRNAs in bacteria.",

We aimed to analyse suprahyoid muscle electrical activity of infants based on lingual fraenulum attachment to the sublingual (ventral) aspect of the tongue and floor of the mouth, during breastfeeding.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsWe studied full-term infants of both genders aged between 1-4 months. Lingual fraenulum evaluation and surface suprahyoid muscle electromyography was performed during breastfeeding. Mean muscle activities were recorded in microvolts and converted into percent values (normalisation) of the reference value. Associations between root mean square and independent variables were tested by one-way analysis of variance and Students t-test with significance level of 5% and test power of 95%.\\n\\nWe evaluated 235 infants while breastfeeding. The lingual fraenulum was commonly attached to the tongues ventral aspect between middle third and apex, and on the mouth floor visible from the lower alveolar ridge. Lower muscle activity was observed with lingual fraenulum attached to apex/lower alveolar ridge, followed by attachment to middle third/lower alveolar ridge, and between middle third and apex/lower alveolar ridge. Highest activity observed in Infants with attachment to middle third/sublingual caruncles, had a thin lingual fraenulum, performed several sucks followed by short pauses, showed coordination between swallowing, sucking, and breathing, did not \\\"bite\\\" nipple, and showed no tongue snapping nor stress.\\n\\nConclusionGreater suprahyoid muscle activity during breastfeeding was observed with lingual fraenulum attachment to middle third of the tongue/sublingual caruncles, showed coordination between swallowing, sucking, and breathing. Surface electromyography is effective in diagnosing lingual fraenulum alterations, whose attachment point raises doubts as restriction of tongue mobility. This technique identifies possible oral motor dysfunctions, enables direct therapeutic interventions and early intervention, and prevents feeding and communication alterations.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionHousehold residents in malaria endemic areas are at high risk of multiple malaria episodes per year. This study investigated the annual household malaria episodes (AHMEs) in three health districts in Cameroon.\n\nMethodsA community-based cross-sectional household survey using a multi-stage cluster design was conducted 2 - 3 years post campaign to assess long-lasting insecticide net (LLINs) ownership, utilisation, and maintenance as well as demographic characteristics. Multinomial regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with household LLIN ownership, utilization, and AHME.\n\nResultsHousehold LLINs ownership, de-facto population with universal utilisation, and AHME were respectively, 92.5%, 16.0%, and 83.4%; thus, 4 out of 25 household residents effectively used LLINs the previous night. AHME was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with age and gender (OR; 1.6, 95% C.I; 1.1 - 2.3) of household head, health district (OR; 2.8, 95% C.I; 1.1 - 7.2) and tiredness (OR; 2.6, 95% C.I; 1.0 - 6.3). LLINs ownership and insufficiency also significantly contributed to AHME. The overall average cost for the treatment of malaria was 6,399.4{+/-}4,892.8Fcfa (11.1{+/-}8.5US$).\n\nConclusionsThe proportion of households with at least one LLIN and those with at least one AHME were high. Findings are of concern given that average cost for the treatment of malaria represents a potentially high economic burden.

    "abstract": "Podospora anserina is a model ascomycetous fungus which shows pronounced phenotypic senescence when grown on solid medium but possesses unlimited lifespan under submerged cultivation. In order to study the genetic aspects of adaptation of P. anserina to submerged cultivation, we initiated a long-term evolution experiment. In the course of the first four years of the experiment, 125 single-nucleotide substitutions and 23 short indels were fixed in eight independently evolving populations. Six proteins that affect fungal growth and development evolved in more than one population; in particular, the G-protein alpha subunit FadA evolved in seven out of eight experimental populations. Parallel evolution at the level of genes and pathways, an excess of nonsense and missense substitutions, and an elevated conservation of proteins and their sites where the changes occurred suggest that many of the observed allele replacements were adaptive and driven by positive selection.\\n\\nAuthor summaryLiving beings adapt to novel conditions that are far from their original environments in different ways. Studying mechanisms of adaptation is crucial for our understanding of evolution. The object of our interest is a multicellular fungus Podospora anserina. This fungus is known for its pronounced senescence and a definite lifespan, but it demonstrates an unlimited lifespan and no signs of senescence when grown under submerged conditions. Soon after transition to submerged cultivation, the rate of growth of P. anserina increases and its pigmentation changes. We wanted to find out whether there are any genetic changes that contribute to adaptation of P. anserina to these novel conditions and initiated a long-term evolutionary experiment on eight independent populations. Over the first four years of the experiment, 148 mutations were fixed in these populations. Many of these mutations lead to inactivation of the part of the developmental pathway in P. anserina, probably reallocating resources to vegetative proliferation in liquid medium. Our observations imply that strong positive selection drives changes in at least some of the affected protein-coding genes.\\n\\nData AvailabilityGenome sequence data have been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under accessions QHKV00000000 (founder genotype A; version QHKV01000000) and QHKU00000000 (founder genotype B; version QHKU01000000), with the respective BioSample accessions SAMN09270751 and SAMN09270757, under BioProject PRJNA473312.

    "abstract": "Patterned expression of many developmental genes is specified by transcription factor gene expression, but is thought to be refined by chromatin-mediated repression. Regulatory DNA sequences called Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) are required to repress some developmental target genes, and are widespread in genomes, suggesting that they broadly affect developmental programs. While PREs in transgenes can nucleate trimethylation on lysine 27 of the histone H3 tail (H3K27me3), none have been demonstrated to be necessary at endogenous chromatin domains. This failure is thought to be due to the fact that most endogenous H3K27me3 domains contain many PREs, and individual PREs may be redundant. In contrast to these ideas, we show here that PREs near the wing selector gene vestigial have distinctive roles at their endogenous locus, even though both PREs are repressors in transgenes. First, a PRE near the promoter is required for vestigial activation and not for repression. Second, only the distal PRE contributes to H3K27me3, but even removal of both PREs does not eliminate H3K27me3 across the vestigial domain. Thus, endogenous chromatin domains appear to be intrinsically marked by H3K27me3, and PREs appear required to enhance this chromatin modification to high levels at inactive genes.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEukaryotic genes are packaged in chromatin, and their transcription relies on activators that recruit RNA polymerases and on repressive factors. Some of these factors factors that modulate chromatin structure to promote or inhibit gene transcription. In multicellular organisms, cell types have distinct patterns of gene expression, and these patterns are controlled by by the expression of cell-type-specific transcription factors and by modulating chromatin structure. The Polycomb system is one major system for the chromatin-mediated silencing of developmental gene expression, where a histone methyltransferase marks extended chromatin domains with trimethylation of lysine-27 of the histone H3 tail (H3K27me3) and forms repressed chromatin. In Drosophila, repressive regulatory elements called Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) are thought to nucleate histone methyltransferase binding which then spreads across these domains. In this study, we demonstrate that two PREs near the developmental vestigial gene have distinct and separable effects on gene activation and chromatin structure. Both PREs are functional repressors in transgenes, but the PRE located near the vestigial promoter is required for gene transcription. This PRE has no effect on histone methylation of the domain. The second PRE, located in the middle of the chromatin domain is required for high-level H3K27me3 of the domain, and this methylation is not required to refine vestigial gene expression. Strikingly, a significant chromatin methylation remains when both PREs are deleted. Our findings imply that PREs near promoters may often play activating roles in gene expression in the Drosophila genome. We suggest that some domains of H3K27me3 occur in regions that lack histone acetylation, and has little consequence for correctly patterning gene expression.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuman papillomaviruses are the most important causative agents for invasive cervical cancer development. HPV type-specific vaccination and HPV cervical cancer screening methods are being widely recommended to control the disease but the epidemiology of the circulating HPV types may vary locally. The circulating HPV-strains have never been assessed in Burundi. This study determined the prevalence and genotype-specific distribution of HPV in four different strata in Burundi: HIV-infected or non-infected and women living in rural or urban areas. Implications for HPV diagnosis and vaccine implementation was discussed.\\n\\nMethodsFour cross-sectional surveys were conducted in Burundi (2013 in a rural area and 2016 in urban area) among rural and urban HIV-infected and uninfected women. Cytology and HPV genotyping was performed to screen women for cervical cancer lesions. Risk factors for HPV infection and cervical cancer lesions were determined using logistic regression model.\\n\\nResultsHPV prevalence was very high in urban area with significant differences between HIV-positive and negative women (p<0.0001). In fact, 45.7% of HIV-positive participants were infected with any HPV type and all were infected with at least one HR/pHR-HPV type. Among the HIV-negative participants, 13.4% were HPV-infected, of whom, only 4 women (2.7%) were infected with HR/pHR-HPV types. In rural, HPV infection did not significantly differ between HIV-positive and negative women (30.0% and 31.3% respectively; p=0.80).\\n\\nIn urban, multiple infections with HR/pHR-HPV types were detected in 13.9% and 2.7% among HIV-positive and negative women respectively (p<0.0001), whereas in rural, multiple infections with HR/pHR-HPV types were detected in 4.7% and 3.3% of HIV positive and negative women respectively (p=0.56).\\n\\nThe most prevalent HR/pHR-HPV types in HIV-positive urban women were HPV 52, 51 and 56. In the HIV-negative urban women, the most prevalent HR/pHR-HPV types were HPV 66, 67 and 18. In HIV-positive rural women, the most prevalent HR/pHR-HPV types were HPV 66, 16 and 18. In the HIV-negative rural women, the most prevalent HR/pHR-HPV types were HPV 16, 66 and 18. Independent risk factors associated with cervical lesions were HPV and HIV infections.\\n\\nConclusionsThere is a high burden of HR/pHR-HPV infections, in particular among HIV-infected urban women. The study points out the need to introduce a comprehensive cervical cancer control program adapted to the context. This study shows that the nonavalent vaccine covers most of the HR/pHR-HPV infections in rural and urban areas among HIV-infected and uninfected women.",

    "abstract": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) devastates the health of piglets but may not infect piglets whose CMP-N-glycolylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) gene mutated (knockouts, KO) by using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing techniques. This hypothesis was tested by using KO piglets challenged with PEDV. Two single-guide RNAs targeting the CMAH gene and Cas9 mRNA were microinjected into the cytoplasm of newly fertilized eggs; 4 live founders generated and proven to be biallelic KO, lacking detectable N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA). The founders were bred, and homozygous offspring were obtained. Two-day-old (in exps. I and III) and 3-day-old (in exp. II) KO and wild-type (WT) piglets were inoculated with TCID50 1x103 PEDV and then fed 20 mL of infant formula (in exps. I and II) or sows colostrum (in exp. III) every 4 hours. In exp. III, the colostrum was offered 6 times and was then replaced with Ringer/5% glucose solution. At 72 hours post-PEDV inoculation (hpi), the animals were euthanized for necropsy, and their intestines were sampled. In all 3 experiments, the piglets showed apparent outward clinical manifestations suggesting that infection occurred despite the CMAH KO. In exp. I, all 6 WT piglets and only 1 of 6 KO piglets died at 72 hpi. Histopathology and immunofluorescence staining showed that the villus epithelial cells of WT piglets were severely exfoliated, but only moderate exfoliation and enterocyte vacuolization was observed in KO piglets. In exp. II, delayed clinical symptoms appeared, yet the immunofluorescence staining/histopathologic inspection (I/H) scores of the two groups differed little. In exp. III, the animals exhibited clinical and pathological signs after inoculation similar to those in exp. II. These results suggest that porcine CMAH KO with nullified NGNA expression are not immune to PEDV but that this KO may lessen the severity of the infection and delay its occurrence.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe infection of villus epithelial cells by PEDV has been suggested to occur via putative sialic acid and aminopeptidase N (APN) receptors. Thus, CMP-N-glycolylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) gene-mutated pigs that lack N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA) receptors should exhibit resistance to PEDV infection even when APN, which is also responsible for peptide digestion and amino acid absorption and should not be tackled and remains intact. This hypothesis was tested in the present study by generating animals of this type; however, after PEDV challenge, they still showed clinical manifestations of infection. Although the hypothesis could not be verified by the results of the study, some of the immunological and histopathological evidence obtained suggested that this genetic alteration may lessen the severity of infection and delay its occurrence. The results also suggested that binding to NGNA is not a sufficient and necessary condition for PEDV infection of enterocytes. The null expression of CMAH by gene editing induced insignificant resistance to PEDV infection in neonatal piglets.",

    "abstract": "Schistosomiasis/Bilharziasis is one of the neglected tropical parasitic diseases caused by different species of genus schistosoma. Among the species, S.mansoni (causative agents of intestinal schistosomiasis) is one of the causes of severe intestinal parasitic infections with high public and medical importance in Ethiopia. There is scarcity of information about the status of S.mansoni infection among the fisherman in the present study area and in the country at large. Therefore this study was designed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of S.mansoni infection among fishermen at Lake Hawassa, southern Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among the fishermen from April to June 2013 in Hawassa, Southern Ethiopia. A total of 243 fishermen were included by Systematic Random Sampling from the lists of the fishermen members in the registration book of fishermen associations in the Hawassa Town. Data on socio-demographic features and risk factors were collected by using semi-structured questionnaires. Stool samples were collected and processed using Kato-Katz thick smear techniques and examined between 30-40 minute for hook worm and after 24 hours for S.mansoni and other soil transmitted helminths (STHs). The overall prevalence of S.mansoni among the fishermen was 29.21% (71/243) and the mean intensity of infection was 158.88 eggs per gram (EPG). The prevalence of intestinal helminths including S.mansoni was 69.54% (169/243). Moreover, the prevalence of soil transmitted helminths (STHs) were 40.74% (99/243), 35.80% (87/243) and 5.76% (14/243) for A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura and hookworm species, respectively. Almost similar prevalence of S.mansoni, 31.82%, 31.75%, 31.94% were recorded in age groups of 15-19, 20-24 and 25-29 years, respectively. Fishermen who are swimming always were 2.92 times [95% CI: 1.554, 5.502] more likely to acquire S.mansoni infection than other water contacting habit of the study participants. The results of current investigation indicated the moderate endemicity of S.mansoni among the fishermen at Lake Hawassa, southern Ethiopia. Fishermen could be the potential risk group for S.mansoni infection and might be responsible for the transmission of S.mansoni to other segments of the communities. Since high prevalence of STH were recorded among the fishermen, integrated prevention and control strategies from different sectors might be important to tackle the problem.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIt is known that schistosomiasis is one of the neglected tropical parasitic diseases. However there is scarcity of information about the status of S.mansoni infection among the fisherman in the study area and in many parts of the world. Knowing the epidemiology of these parasites among the risk groups (fishermen) can contribute a lot to scale up the current control and elimination strategies. In addition, Fishermen could be the potential risk group for S.mansoni infection and might be responsible for the transmission of S.mansoni to other segments of the communities. To determine the prevalence of S.mansoni infection among the fisherman, the present study is done using stool samples from study groups.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe species of the Rickettsia genus is separated into four groups: the ancestral group, typhus group, transitional group and spotted fever group. Rickettsia parkeri, a spotted fever group Rickettsia, has been reported across the American continents as infecting several tick species and is associated with a relatively mild human disease characterized by eschar formation at the tick feeding site, fever, myalgia and rash. Currently several mouse models that provide a good approach to study the acute lethal disease caused by Rickettsia, but these models can only be performed in an animal biosafety level 3 laboratory. We present an alternative mouse model for acute lethal rickettsial disease, using R. parkeri and C3H/HeN mice, with the advantage that this model can be studied in an animal biosafety level 2 laboratory.\\n\\nPrincipal findingsIn the C3H/HeN mouse model, we determined that infection with 1 x 106 and 1 x 107 viable R. parkeri Atlantic Rainforest-like isolate produced dose-dependent severity, whereas infection with 1 x 108 viable bacteria resulted in a lethal illness. The animals became moribund on day five or six post-infection. The lethal disease was characterized by ruffled fur, erythema, labored breathing, decreased activity, and hunched back, which began on day three post-infection (p.i.) and coincided with the peak bacterial loads. Significant splenomegaly (on days three and five p.i.), neutrophilia (on days three and five p.i.), and thrombocytopenia (on days one, three and five p.i.) were observed.\\n\\nSignificanceThe greatest advantage of this inbred mouse model is the ability to investigate immunity and pathogenesis of rickettsiosis with all the tools available at biosafety level 2.\\n\\nAuthor summaryRickettsia is a bacterial genus that contains distinct species that are transmitted by arthropods. Many of these agents produce infection and disease in humans. The illness can range from very aggressive, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, to mild human disease characterized by eschar formation at the tick feeding site and less severe symptoms caused by Rickettsia parkeri. To study these diseases, animal models are invaluable, and mouse models offer the best advantages. Several mouse models are most useful for study of the acute lethal disease produced by these bacteria, providing the opportunity to test different treatments and vaccine candidates. However, work with these models requires an animal biosafety level 3 laboratory. In this report, we present an alternative mouse model to study acute lethal spotted fever group rickettsial disease with the advantage that experiments can be performed at biosafety level 2.",

    "abstract": "The repeatability or predictability of evolution is a central question in evolutionary biology, and most often addressed in experimental evolution studies. Here, we infer how genetically heterogeneous natural systems acquire the same molecular changes, to address how genomic background affects adaptation in natural populations. In particular, we take advantage of independently formed neo-sex chromosomes in Drosophila species that have evolved dosage compensation by co-opting the dosage compensation (MSL) complex, to study the mutational paths that have led to the acquisition of 100s of novel binding sites for the MSL complex in different species. This complex recognizes a conserved 21-bp GA-rich sequence motif that is enriched on the X chromosome, and newly formed X chromosomes recruit the MSL complex by de novo acquisition of this binding motif. We identify recently formed sex chromosomes in the Drosophila repleta and robusta species groups by genome sequencing, and generate genomic occupancy maps of the MSL complex to infer the location of novel binding sites. We find that diverse mutational paths were utilized in each species to evolve 100s of de novo binding motifs along the neo-X, including expansions of microsatellites and transposable element insertions. However, the propensity to utilize a particular mutational path differs between independently formed X chromosomes, and appears to be contingent on genomic properties of that species, such as simple repeat or transposable element density. This establishes the \\\"genomic environment\\\" as an important determinant in predicting the outcome of evolutionary adaptations.",

    "abstract": "Signaling cross-talks between auxin, a regulator of plant development and Ca2+, a universal second messenger have been proposed to modulate developmental plasticity in plants. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we report that in Arabidopsis roots, auxin elicits specific Ca2+ signaling pattern that spatially coincide with the expression pattern of auxin-regulated genes. We identified the EF-hand protein CMI1 (Ca2+ sensor Modulator of ICR1) as an interactor of the ROP effector ICR1 (Interactor of Constitutively active ROP). CMI1 is monomeric in solution, changes its secondary structure at Ca2+ concentrations ranging from 10-9 to 10-8 M and its interaction with ICR1 is Ca2+ dependent, involving a conserved hydrophobic pocket. cmi1 mutants display an increased auxin response including shorter primary roots, longer root hairs, longer hypocotyls and altered lateral root formation while ectopic expression of CMI1 induces root growth arrest and reduced auxin responses at the root tip. When expressed alone, CMI1 is localized at the plasma membrane, the cytoplasm and in nuclei. Interaction of CMI1 and ICR1 results in exclusion of CMI1 from nuclei and suppression of the root growth arrest. CMI1 expression is directly upregulated by auxin while expression of auxin induced genes is enhanced in cmi1 concomitantly with repression of auxin induced Ca2+ increases in the lateral root cap and vasculature, indicating that CMI1 represses early auxin responses. Collectively, our findings identify a crucial function of Ca2+ signaling and CMI1 in root growth and suggest an auxin-Ca2+ regulatory feedback loop that fine tunes root development.",

    "abstract": "Statin treatment increases bone mineral density (BMD) and reduces fracture risk, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess whether this relation is explained by a specific effect in response to statin use, or by a general effect of lipid-lowering. We utilized 400 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) robustly associated with plasma lipid levels and results from a heel BMD GWAS (derived from quantitative ultrasound) in 426,824 individuals from the UK Biobank. We performed univariate and multivariable MR analyses of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride levels on BMD. To test whether the effect of statins on BMD was mediated by lowering lipid levels, MR was repeated with and without SNPs in the HMGCR region, the gene targeted by statins. Univariate MR analyses provided evidence for a causal effect of LDL-C on BMD ({beta} = -0.060; -0.084 to -0.036; P = 4x10-6; standard deviation change in BMD per standard deviation change in LDL-C, with 95% CI), but not HDL or triglycerides. Multivariable MR analysis suggested that the effect of LDL-C on BMD was independent of HDL-C and triglycerides, and sensitivity analyses involving MR Egger and weighted median MR approaches suggested that the LDL-C results were robust to pleiotropy. MR analyses of LDL-C restricted to SNPs in the HMGCR region showed similar effects on BMD({beta} = -0.083; -0.132 to -0.034; P = 0.001) to those excluding these SNPs ({beta} = -0.063; -0.090 to -0.036; P = 8x10-6). Bidirectional MR analyses provided some evidence for a causal effect of BMD on plasma LDL-C levels. Our results suggest that effects of statins on BMD are at least partly due to their LDL-C lowering effect. Further studies are required to examine the potential role of modifying plasma lipid levels in treating osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "Viral infection exerts selection pressure on marine microbes as viral-induced cell lysis causes 20 to 50% of cell mortality resulting in fluxes of biomass into oceanic dissolved organic matter. Archaeal and bacterial populations can defend against viral infection using the CRISPR-Cas system which relies on specific matching between a spacer sequence and a viral gene. If a CRISPR spacer match to any gene within a viral genome is equally effective in preventing lysis, then no viral genes should be preferentially matched by CRISPR spacers. However, if there are differences in effectiveness then certain viral genes may demonstrate a greater frequency of CRISPR spacer matches. Indeed, homology search analyses of bacterioplankton CRISPR spacer sequences against virioplankton sequences revealed preferential matching of replication proteins, nucleic acid binding proteins, and viral structural proteins. Positive selection pressure for effective viral defense is one parsimonious explanation for these observations. CRISPR spacers from virioplankton metagenomes preferentially matched methyltransferase and phage integrase genes within virioplankton sequences. These viriolankton CRISPR spacers may assist infected host cells in defending against competing phage. Analyses also revealed that half of the spacer-matched viral genes were unknown and that some genes matched several spacers and some spacers matched multiple genes, a many-to-many relationship. Thus, CRISPR spacer matching may be an evolutionary algorithm, agnostically identifying those genes under stringent selection pressure for sustaining viral infection and lysis. Investigating this subset of viral genes could reveal those genetic mechanisms essential to viral-host interactions and provide new technologies for optimizing CRISPR defense in beneficial microbes.",

Multiple types of stress decrease parkin protein levels, an effect that may be relevant to sporadic Parkinsons disease (PD), but the mechanism(s) involved in this loss remain largely unclear. We sought to elucidate these mechanisms using a PD-relevant stressor, L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine, which forms reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as toxic quinones via auto-oxidation. We find that L-DOPA causes parkin loss through both an oxidative stress-independent and an oxidative stress-dependent pathway. Characterization of the latter reveals that it requires both the kinase PINK1 and parkins interaction with phosphorylated ubiquitin (phospho-Ub) and is mediated by proteasomal degradation.\\n\\nSurprisingly, mitochondrial parkin activity and autoubiquitination as well as mitophagy are not required for such loss. During stress induced by the oxidative stressor hydrogen peroxide or the metabolic uncoupler CCCP, parkin degradation also requires its association with phospho-Ub, indicating that this mechanism is broadly generalizable. As oxidative stress, metabolic dysfunction and phospho-Ub levels are all elevated in PD patients, we suggest that these changes may lead to the loss of parkin expression in PD.",

We found that both repression and activation gene expression programs, affecting hundreds of genes, are significantly hampered in the absence of PERK. Specifically, PERK -/- cells do not show global translational inhibition, nor do they specifically activate early gene expression programs upon short exposure to ER stress. Furthermore, while PERK -/- cells do activate/repress late ER-stress response genes, the response is substantially weaker. Importantly, we highlight a widespread PERK-dependent repression gene expression program, consisting of ER targeted proteins, including transmembrane proteins, glycoproteins, and proteins with disulfide bonds. This phenomenon occurs in various different cell types, and has a major translational regulatory component. Moreover, we revealed a novel interplay between PERK and the XBP1-ATF6 arms of the UPR, whereby PERK attenuates the expression of a specific subset of XBP1-ATF6 targets, further illuminating the complexity of the integrated ER stress response.",

The underlying mechanisms of this development, however, are still poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a thorough investigation of error processing in a Flanker task in a cross-sectional sample of participants 8 to 19 years of age (n = 98). We examined age-differences in event related potentials known to be associated with error processing, namely the error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity (Pe), as well as their relationships with task performance, post-error adjustments and regional cingulate cortex thickness and surface area. We found that ERN amplitude increased with age, while Pe amplitude remained constant. A more negative ERN was associated with higher task accuracy and faster reaction times, while a more positive Pe was associated with higher accuracy, independently of age. When estimating post-error adjustments from trials following both incongruent and congruent trials, post-error slowing and post-error improvement in accuracy both increased with age, but this was only found for post-error slowing when only analysing trials following incongruent trials. There were no age-independent associations between either ERN or Pe amplitude and cingulate cortex thickness or area measures.",

    "abstract": "In order to establish an animal model of cerebral hernia induced by acute intracranial hypertension for subsequent research in emergency medicine. Six Guangxi Ba-Ma mini-pigs which were injected with autologous arterial blood by micropump to induce intracranial hematoma in the frontal and temporal parietal lobes. Changes in intracranial pressure (ICP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)were observed during hematoma formation. Morphological changes and the occupying effects of intracranial hematoma were analyzed using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head. ICP, MAP and CPP gradually increased during blood injection, and they began to slowly decrease at 10 min after injection, though they remained higher than before injection. These three parameters were significantly different before blood injection, immediately after injection and at 10 min after injection (P< 0.05). Head CT and MRI showed cerebral hernia induced by acute intracranial hypertension. These results demonstrate micropump injection of autologous arterial blood can lead to acute intracranial hypertension in mini-pigs, which may be a useful model of cerebral hernia.",

    "abstract": "Moores law states that computers get faster and less expensive over time. In contrast in biopharma, there is the reverse spelling, Erooms law, which states that drug discovery is getting slower and costing more money every year. Herein, we propose a solution to this problem. We put forth a consensus algorithm for inexpensively and rapidly prioritizing new factors of interest (e.g., a gene or drug) in human disease research. Specifically, we argue for synthetic interaction testing in mammalian cells using cell fitness - which reflect changes in cell number that could be due many effects - as a readout to judge the potential of the new factor. That is, if we combine perturbing a known factor with perturbing an unknown factor and they produce a synergistic, i.e., multiplicative rather than additive cell fitness phenotype, this justifies proceeding with the unknown gene/drug in more complex models where the known perturbation is already validated. This recommendation is backed by the following evidence we demonstrate herein: 1) human genes currently known to be important to cell fitness involve nearly all classifications of cellular and molecular processes; 2) Nearly all human genes important in cancer - a disease defined by altered cell number - are also important in other common diseases; 3) Many drugs affect a patients condition and the fitness of their cells comparably. We provide proof of concept of the Omniphenotype model using the widely used osteoporosis drug, bisphosphonates, implicating its mechanism of action (MoA) genes, ATRAID, SLC37A3, and FDPS, as potential gerotargets for neurodegenerative conditions. Taken together, these findings suggest cell fitness could be a broadly applicable phenotype for understanding gene, disease, and drug function. Measuring cell fitness is robust and requires little time and money. These are features that have long been capitalized on by pioneers using model organisms that we hope more mammalian biologists will recognize.\n\nShort summaryCell fitness is a biological hash function that enables interoperability of biomedical data.",

    "abstract": "The ability to estimate precisely the time to contact (TTC) of the objects is necessary for planning actions in dynamic environments. TTC estimation is involved in many everyday activities with different levels of difficulty. Although tracking a ball that moves at a constant speed and estimating the time it reaches a non-moving target can be fairly simple, tracking a fast moving car with inconsistent speeds and estimating the time it reaches another car is rather difficult. In this study, we asked participants to estimate TTC of an object in transversal and head-on motions. The object became invisible shortly after movement initiation. The results demonstrated that TTC estimation for transversal motion is more accurate than for head-on motion. We present a mathematical model to explain why humans are better in estimating TTC for transversal motion than for head-on motion.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal aberration and DNA copy number change are robust hallmarks of cancer. Imaging of spots generated using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) of locus specific probes is routinely used to detect copy number changes in tumour nuclei. However, it often does not perform well on solid tumour tissue sections, where partially represented or overlapping nuclei are common. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a computational approach called FrenchFISH, which comprises a nuclear volume correction method coupled with two types of Poisson models: either a Poisson model for improved manual spot counting without the need for control probes; or a homogenous Poisson Point Process model for automated spot counting. We benchmarked the performance of FrenchFISH against previous approaches in a controlled simulation scenario and exemplify its use in 12 ovarian cancer FFPE-tissue sections, for which we assess copy number alterations in three loci (c-Myc, hTERC and SE7). We show that FrenchFISH outperforms standard spot counting approaches and that the automated spot counting is significantly faster than manual without loss of performance. FrenchFISH is a general approach that can be used to enhance clinical diagnosis on sections of any tissue.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCancer genomes can look very chaotic, because cancer cells are unable to fully repair errors in DNA replication during cell division. While a healthy genome has two copies of every chromosome, in a cancer genome some pieces can be lost completely and others can appear in 50 copies. To diagnose cancers and to decide on the right therapeutic strategy for a patient, it can be very important to know how many copies of a particular piece of DNA exist in a cell. The standard technique used in the clinic to assess DNA copy number is called FISH, short for fluorescence in situ hybridisation. This technique uses fluorescent probes that bind to a DNA piece of interest and show up as glowing spots in a microscopic image. Counting the spots in an image is a labour-and time-intensive process that is generally done by well-trained experts. Here we present a statistical approach to automatically count FISH spots, which outperforms previously proposed methods, and has the potential to substantially speed up clinical diagnostics.",
