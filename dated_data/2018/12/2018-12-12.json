    "abstract": "Although recombination is known to occur in FMDV, it is considered only a minor determinant of virus sequence diversity. This is because recombination appears to be highly suppressed at phylogenetic scales; inter-serotypic recombination events are rare; and in those a mosaic structure is present whereby recombination only occurs almost exclusively in non-structural proteins. Here we show that co-inoculation of closely related strains in buffaloes results over time in extensive within-host recombination in the genomic region coding for structural proteins. This enables us to directly estimate recombination rates for the first time. Quite surprisingly, the effective recombination rate in VP1 during the acute infection phase turns out to be about 0.1 per base per year, i.e. comparable to the mutation/substitution rate. Thanks to the features of our experimental setup, we are also able to build a high-resolution map of effective within-host recombination in the capsid-coding region. We find that the linkage disequilibrium pattern inside VP1 points to a mosaic structure with two main genetic blocks. Positive epistatic interactions between co-evolved variants appear to be present both within and between blocks. These interactions are due to intra-host selection both at the RNA and protein level. Overall our findings show that during FMDV co-infections by closely related strains, capsid-coding genes recombine within the host at a much higher rate than expected, despite the presence of strong constraints dictated by the capsid structure. Although those intra-host results are not immediately transportable to a phylogenetic setting, they force us to reconsider the relevance of recombination and epistasis, suggesting that they must play a major and so far underappreciated role in the molecular evolution of the virus at all time scales.\\n\\nAuthor summaryRecombination in the capsid-coding region of the Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus genome is highly suppressed at phylogenetic scales. However, the role of recombination in the intra-host dynamics of the virus is not known. In our experiment, a co-infection of African buffaloes with closely related FMDV strains results in a population structure of the intra-host viral swarm, allowing us to detect recombination events. For structural protein-coding sequences, the swarm dynamics is driven by extensive within-host recombination. During the acute infection phase, we infer intra-host recombination rates of 0.1 per base per year, comparable to the typical mutation rate of the virus. The recombination map reveals two linkage blocks within the VP1 protein-coding sequence. Epistatic interactions between co-evolved mutations in VP1 are caused by intra-host selection at the RNA and protein level and are present both within and between blocks. Our findings support a major role for recombination and epistasis in the intra-host evolution of FMDV.",

    "abstract": "A long-held, but poorly tested, assumption in natural populations is that individuals that disperse into new areas for reproduction are at a disadvantage compared to individuals that reproduce in their natal habitat, underpinning the eco-evolutionary processes of local adaptation and ecological speciation. Here, we capitalize on fine-scale population structure and natural dispersal events to compare the reproductive success of local and dispersing individuals captured on the same spawning ground in four consecutive parent-offspring cohorts of wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Parentage analysis conducted on adults and juvenile fish showed that local females and males had 9.6 and 2.9 times higher reproductive success than dispersers, respectively. Our results reveal how dispersal disadvantage in reproductive success may act in natural populations to drive population divergence and local adaptation over microgeographic spatial scales without clear morphological differences or physical barriers to gene flow.",

    "abstract": "Failure to make adaptive immune responses is a hallmark of aging. In particular reduced B cell function leads to poor vaccination efficacy and a high prevalence of infections in the elderly. However, the molecular mechanism underlying immune senescence is largely unknown. Here we show that autophagy levels are specifically reduced in mature lymphoid cells, leading to compromised memory B cell responses in old individuals. Spermidine, a naturally occurring polyamine metabolite, induces autophagy in vivo and rejuvenates memory B cell responses in an autophagy-dependent manner. Mechanistically, spermidine post-translationally modifies the translation factor eIF5A, which assists the synthesis of TFEB, a key transcription factor of autophagy. Spermidine is depleted in the elderly, leading to reduced TFEB expression and autophagy. Replenishing spermidine restored this pathway and improved the responses of old human B cells. Taken together, our results reveal an unexpected autophagy regulatory mechanism mediated by eIF5A at the translational level, and this pathway can be harnessed to rejuvenate immune senescence in humans.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks are required to meet significant metabolic demands associated with performing sophisticated computational tasks in the brain. The necessity for efficient transmission of information imposes stringent constraints on the metabolic pathways that can be used for energy generation at the synapse, and thus low availability of energetic substrates can reduce the efficacy of synaptic function. Here we study the effects of energetic substrate availability on global neural network behavior and find that glucose alone can sustain excitatory neurotransmission required to generate high-frequency synchronous bursting that emerges in culture. In contrast, obligatory oxidative energetic substrates such as lactate and pyruvate are unable to substitute for glucose, indicating that processes involving glucose metabolism form the primary energy-generating pathways supporting coordinated network activity. Our experimental results are discussed in the context of the role that metabolism plays in supporting the performance of individual synapses, including the relative contributions from postsynaptic responses, astrocytes, and presynaptic vesicle cycling. We propose a simple computational model for our excitatory cultures that accurately captures the inability of metabolically compromised synapses to sustain synchronous bursting when extracellular glucose is depleted.",

    "abstract": "The centrosome is thought to be the major neuronal microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in early neuronal development, producing microtubules with a radial organization. In addition, albeit in vitro, recent work showed that isolated centrosomes could serve as an actin-organizing center (Farina et al., 2016), raising the possibility that neuronal development may, in addition, require a centrosome-based actin radial organization. Here we report, using super-resolution microscopy and live-cell imaging, F-actin organization around the centrosome with dynamic F-actin aster-like structures with F-actin fibers extending and retracting actively. Photoconversion/photoactivation experiments and molecular manipulations of F-actin stability reveal a robust flux of somatic F-actin towards the cell periphery. Finally, we show that somatic F-actin intermingles with centrosomal PCM-1 satellites. Knockdown of PCM-1 and disruption of centrosomal activity not only affect F-actin dynamics near the centrosome but also in distal growth cones. Collectively the data show a radial F-actin organization during early neuronal development, which might be a cellular mechanism for providing peripheral regions with a fast and continuous source of actin polymers; hence sustaining initial neuronal development.",

The latter yields cell type information, although the data can be noisy and typically are derived from a small number of subjects.\\n\\nResultsComplementing these approaches, we develop a method to estimate subject- and cell-type-specific (CTS) gene expression from tissue using an empirical Bayes method that borrows information across multiple measurements of the same tissue per subject (e.g., multiple regions of the brain). Analyzing expression data from multiple brain regions from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) reveals CTS expression, which then permits downstream analyses, such as identification of CTS expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL).\\n\\nAvailability and implementationWe implement this method as an R package MIND, hosted on https://github.com/randel/MIND.",

The inner membrane assembly platform (AP) components PulC, PulE, PulL, PulM and PulN have a relative stoichiometric ratio of 2:1:1:1:1, respectively. The PulE ATPase, PulL and PulM combine to form a flexible hexameric hub. Symmetry mismatch between the OMC and AP is overcome by PulC linkers spanning the periplasm with PulC HR domains binding independently at the secretin base.

    "abstract": "The molecular function and fate of mRNAs are controlled by RNA binding proteins (RBPs). However, identification of the interacting proteome of a specific mRNA in vivo is still very challenging. Based on the widely-used RNA tagging with MS2 aptamers for RNA visualization, we developed a novel RNA proximity biotinylation (RNA-BioID) method by tethering biotin ligase (BirA*) via MS2 coat protein (MCP) at the 3UTR of endogenously MS2 tagged {beta}-actin mRNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We demonstrate the dynamics of the {beta}-actin mRNA interactome by characterizing its changes upon serum-induced localization of the mRNA. Apart from the previously known interactors, we identified over 60 additional {beta}-actin associated RBPs by RNA-BioID, among them the KH-domain containing protein FUBP3/MARTA2 has shown to be required for {beta}-actin mRNA localization. This protein binds to the 3-untranslated region of {beta}-actin mRNA, is essential for {beta}-actin mRNA localization but does not interact with the characterized {beta}-actin zipcode element. RNA-BioID provides a tool to identify new mRNA interactors and to study the dynamic view of the interacting proteome of endogenous mRNAs in space and time.",

    "abstract": "Morphogenesis often yields organs with robust size and shapes, whereas cell growth and deformation feature significant spatio-temporal variability. Here, we investigate whether tissue responses to mechanical signals contribute to resolve this apparent paradox. We built a model of growing tissues made of fiber-like material, which may account for the cytoskeleton, polar cell-cell adhesion, or the extracellular matrix in animals, and for the cell wall in plants. We considered the synthesis and remodeling of this material, as well as the modulation of synthesis by isotropic and anisotropic response to mechanical stress. Formally, our model describes an expanding, mechanoresponsive, nematic, and active fluid. We show that mechanical responses buffer localized perturbations, with two possible regimes - hypo-responsive and hyper-responsive, and the transition between the two corresponds to a minimum value of the relaxation time. Whereas robustness of shapes suggests that growth fluctuations are confined to small scales, our model yields growth fluctuations that have long-range correlations. This indicates that growth fluctuations are a significant source of heterogeneity in development. Nevertheless, we find that mechanical responses may dampen such fluctuations, with a specific magnitude of anisotropic response that minimizes heterogeneity of tissue contours. We finally discuss how our predictions might apply to the development of plants and animals. Altogether, our results call for the systematic quantification of fluctuations in growing tissues.",

Porcine organs are considered favorable for xenotransplantation duo to similar size and function to human organ. However, porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are potential infectious agents during xenotransplantation as they are able to infect and horizontally transfer among human cells. Furthermore, PERVs can be endogenized in pig genomes and are transmitted genetically in a Mendelian fashion. Here, we depict a complex evolutionary history of modern PERVs.\\n\\nResultsWe in silico mined 142 mammalian genomes and 14 pig genomes. This led to the documentation of 185 PERVs and a new viral cluster. Large-scale genomic alterations were found in most PERVs including many insertion-deletion events and which are suggestive of ancient origins, and pig genomes have been shaped by PERV-mediated genomic rearrangement during evolution. Notably, we found that lesser Egyptian jerboa and rock hyrax harbor ancestral PERV-related elements indicative of ancient cross-species transmission events from none-porcine species to pigs. A comprehensive analysis of these viral \\\"fossils\\\" suggested that recombination among none-porcine endogenous retroviruses led to the origination of PERVs.\\n\\nConclusionFor the first time, using large scale genomic mining, we decipher a complex evolutionary history for the PERVs. These new findings help us to understand the past of PERVs which pose the potential risk in clinical trials of xenotransplantation and provide novel insights into the origin and evolution of a human-infecting pathogen.",

    "abstract": "During voluntary task selection there are a number of internal and external biases that may guide such a choice. However, it is not well understood how reward influences task selection when multiple options are possible. To address this issue, we examined brain activation in a voluntary task-switching paradigm while participants underwent fMRI (n=19). To reinforce the overall goal to choose the tasks randomly, participants were told of a large bonus they would receive at the end of the experiment for making random task choices. We also examined how occasional, random rewards influenced both task performance and brain activation. We hypothesized that these transient rewards would increase the value of the just-performed task and therefore bias participants to choose to repeat the same task on the subsequent trial. Contrary to expectations, transient reward had no consistent behavioral effect on subsequent task choice. Nevertheless, the receipt of such rewards did influence activation in brain regions associated with reward processing as well as those associated with goal-directed control. In addition, reward on a prior trial was found to influence activation during task choice on a subsequent trial, with greater activation in a number of executive function regions as compared to no-reward trials. We posit that both the random presentation of transient rewards and the overall task bonus for random task choices together reinforced the goal to choose the tasks randomly, which in turn influenced activation in both reward-related regions and those regions involved in abstract goal processing.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose to estimate tree defoliation from ground-level RGB photos with convolutional neural networks (CNN). Tree defoliation is usually assessed with field campaigns, where experts estimate multiple tree health indicators per sample site. Campaigns span entire countries to come up with a holistic, nation-wide picture of forest health. Surveys are very laborious, expensive, time-consuming and need a large number of experts. We aim at making the monitoring process more efficient by casting tree defoliation estimation as an image interpretation problem. What makes this task challenging is strong variance in lighting, viewpoint, scale, tree species, and defoliation types. Instead of accounting for each factor separately through explicit modelling, we learn a joint distribution directly from a large set of annotated training images following the end-to-end learning paradigm of deep learning. The proposed workflow works as follows: (i) Human experts visit individual trees in forests distributed all over Switzerland, (ii) acquire one photo per tree with an off-the-shelf, hand-held RGB camera and (iii) assign a defoliation value. The CNN approach is (iv) trained on a subset of the images with expert defoliation assessments and (v) tested on a hold-out part to check predicted values against ground truth. We evaluate our supervised method on three data sets with different level of difficulty acquired in Swiss forests and achieve an average mean absolute error (avgMAE) of 7.6% for the joint data set after cross-validation. Comparison to a group of human experts on one of the data sets shows that our CNN approach performs only 0.9 percent points worse. We show that tree defoliation estimation from ground-level RGB images with a CNN works well and achieves performance close to human experts.",

    "abstract": "Membranes in cells have defined distributions of lipids in each leaflet, controlled by lipid scramblases and flip/floppases. However, for some intracellular membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum the scramblases have not been identified. Members of the TMEM16 family have either lipid scramblase and ion channel activity, or specific chloride channel activity. Although TMEM16K is widely distributed and associated with the neurological disorder autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCAR10), its location in cells, function and structure are largely uncharacterised. Here we show that TMEM16K is an ER-resident calcium-regulated lipid scramblase. Our crystal structures of TMEM16K show a scramblase fold, with an open lipid transporting groove. Additional structures solved by cryo-EM reveal extensive conformational changes extending from the cytoplasmic to the ER side of the membrane, giving a state with a closed lipid permeation pathway. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the open-groove conformation is necessary for scramblase activity. Our results suggest mechanisms by which missense variants of TMEM16K could cause SCAR10 ataxia, providing new hypotheses to explore for therapy.",

    "abstract": "GABAergic interneurons are chiefly responsible for controlling the activity of local circuits in the cortex1,2. However, the rules that govern the wiring of interneurons are not well understood3. Chandelier cells (ChCs) are a type of GABAergic interneuron that control the output of hundreds of neighbouring pyramidal cells through axo-axonic synapses which target the axon initial segment (AIS)4. Despite their importance in modulating circuit activity, our knowledge of the development and function of axo-axonic synapses remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the role of activity in the formation and plasticity of ChC synapses. In vivo imaging of ChCs during development uncovered a narrow window (P12-P18) over which axons arborized and formed connections. We found that increases in the activity of either pyramidal cells or individual ChCs during this temporal window resulted in a reversible decrease in axo-axonic connections. Voltage imaging of GABAergic transmission at the AIS showed that axo-axonic synapses were depolarising during this period. Identical manipulations of network activity in older mice (P40-P46), when ChC synapses are inhibitory, resulted in an increase in axo-axonic synapses. We propose that the direction of ChC plasticity follows homeostatic rules that depend on the polarity of axo-axonic synapses.",

    "abstract": "A holobiont is a composite organism consisting of a host together with its microbiome, such as a coral with its zooxanthellae. Hosts and their microbiomes are often intimately integrated in behavior, physiology, anatomy, and development. To explain this integration, some investigators contend that selection operates on holobionts as a unit and view the microbiomes genes as extending the hosts nuclear genome to jointly comprise a hologenome. Holobiont selection then operates on holobionts with their hologenomes by analogy to how ordinary natural selection operates on individuals with their genes. Other investigators point out that vertical transmission of microbiomes is uncommon. They contend that holobiont selection cannot be effective because a holobionts microbiome is an acquired condition rather than an inherited trait. The disagreement between these positions invites a simple mathematical model to see how holobiont selection might operate and to assess its plausibility as an evolutionary force.\\n\\nHere I present two variants of such a model. In one variant, juvenile hosts obtain microbiomes from their parents (vertical transmission). In the other variant, microbiomes of juvenile hosts are assembled from source pools containing the combined microbiomes of all parents (horizontal transmission). According to both variants, holobiont selection indeed causes evolutionary change in holobiont traits. Therefore, holobiont selection is plausibly an effective evolutionary force with either mode of microbiome transmission.\\n\\nFurthermore, the modeling employs two distinct concepts of inheritance, depending on the mode of microbiome transmission: collective inheritance whereby juveniles inherit a sample of the collected genomes from all parents as contrasted with lineal inheritance whereby juveniles inherit the genomes from only their own parents. Collective inheritance may also apply to the evolution of soil and other microbes that feature large amounts of horizontal gene transfer and may underlie cultural evolution wherein each generation inherits a sample from the collected knowledge of the preceding generation. A distinction between collective and lineal inheritance also features in theories of multilevel selection.",

    "abstract": "Cardiorenal syndrome is defined by primary heart failure conditions influencing or leading to renal injury or dysfunction. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major co-existing form of heart failure (HF) with renal diseases. Myocardin (MYOCD), a cardiac-specific co-activator of serum response factor (SRF), is increased in DCM mice and patient cardiac tissues and plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of DCM. Inhibiting the increased MYOCD has shown to be partially rescuing the DCM mice phenotype. However, expression levels of MYOCD in the cardiac tissues of the cardiorenal syndromic patients and the beneficial effect of inhibiting MYOCD in a cardiorenal syndrome model remains to be explored.\n\nHere, we analyzed the expression levels of MYOCD in the DCM patients with and without renal diseases. We also explored, whether cardiac specific silencing of MYOCD expression could ameliorate the cardiac remodeling and improve cardiac function in a renal artery ligated rat model (RAL). We observed an increase in MYOCD levels in the endomyocardial biopsies of DCM patients associated with renal failure compared to DCM alone. Silencing of MYOCD in RAL rats by a cardiac homing peptide conjugated MYOCD siRNA resulted in attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and restoration of the left ventricular functions.\n\nOur data suggest hyper-activation of MYOCD in the pathogenesis of the cardiorenal failure cases. Also, MYOCD silencing showed beneficial effects by rescuing cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, size and function in a cardiorenal rat model.",

To address this problem directly, we performed a high-throughput search for correlated evolution among sites associated with resistance to a fluoroquinolone antibiotic using whole genome data from clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, before validating our computational predictions experimentally. We show that for at least two sites, this correlation is underlain by epistasis. Our analysis also revealed eight additional pairs of synonymous substitutions displaying correlated evolution underlain by physical linkage, rather than selection associated with antibiotic resistance. Our results provide direct evidence that both epistasis and physical linkage among sites can drive the correlated evolution identified by high throughput computational tools. In other words, the observation of correlated evolution is not by itself sufficient evidence to guarantee that the sites in question are epistatic; such a claim requires additional evidence, ideally coming from direct estimates of epistasis, based on experimental evidence.",

We show that functional diversity adds information that is not captured by raw diversity, revealing signatures of e.g. clonal selection, and that unlike raw diversity, functional diversity is a robust measure that does not require correction for sampling error. Finally, we show that according to functional diversity, unlike raw diversity, individuals repertoires overlap substantially, indicating a definable ceiling for the functional diversity of human adaptive immunity.

Taking advantage of linked-read sequencing, we developed a highly efficient method for genome-wide identification of COs at kilobase resolution in pooled recombinants. We first tested this method using a pool of Arabidopsis F2 recombinants, and obtained results that recapitulated those identified from the same plants using individual whole-genome sequencing. By applying this method to a pool of pollen DNA from a single F1 plant, we established a highly accurate CO landscape without generating or sequencing a single recombinant plant. The simplicity of this approach now enables the simultaneous generation and analysis of multiple CO landscapes and thereby allows for efficient comparison of genotypic and environmental effects on recombination, accelerating the pace at which the mechanisms for the regulation of recombination can be elucidated.",

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a widely used and sensitive technique to obtain structural information on complex mixtures. However, just knowing the molecular masses of the mixtures constituents is almost always insufficient for confident assignment of the associated chemical structures. Structural information can be augmented through MS fragmentation experiments whereby detected metabolites are fragmented giving rise to MS/MS spectra. However, how can we maximize the structural information we gain from fragmentation spectra?\\n\\nWe recently proposed a substructure-based strategy to enhance metabolite annotation for complex mixtures by considering metabolites as the sum of (bio)chemically relevant moieties that we can detect through mass spectrometry fragmentation approaches. Our MS2LDA tool allows us to discover - unsupervised - groups of mass fragments and/or neutral losses termed Mass2Motifs that often correspond to substructures. After manual annotation, these Mass2Motifs can be used in subsequent MS2LDA analyses of new datasets, thereby providing structural annotations for many molecules that are not present in spectral databases.\\n\\nHere, we describe how additional strategies, taking advantage of i) combinatorial in-silico matching of experimental mass features to substructures of candidate molecules, and ii) automated machine learning classification of molecules, can facilitate semi-automated annotation of substructures. We show how our approach accelerates the Mass2Motif annotation process and therefore broadens the chemical space spanned by characterized motifs. Our machine learning model used to classify fragmentation spectra learns the relationships between fragment spectra and chemical features. Classification prediction on these features can be aggregated for all molecules that contribute to a particular Mass2Motif and guide Mass2Motif annotations.\\n\\nTo make annotated Mass2Motifs available to the community, we also present motifDB: an open database of Mass2Motifs that can be browsed and accessed programmatically through an API. MotifDB is integrated within ms2lda.org, allowing users to efficiently search for characterized motifs in their own experiments. We expect that with an increasing number of Mass2Motif annotations available through a growing database we can more quickly gain insight in the constituents of complex mixtures. That will allow prioritization towards novel or unexpected chemistries and faster recognition of known biochemical building blocks.",

    "abstract": "The recent boom in genotype-phenotype studies has led to a greater understanding of the genetic architecture of a variety of traits. Among these traits, however, behaviors are still lacking, perhaps because they are complex and environmentally sensitive phenotypes, making them difficult to measure reliably for association studies. Here, we aim to fill this gap in knowledge with the results of a genetic screen for a complex behavioral difference, pupation site choice, between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. In this study, we demonstrate a significant contribution of the X chromosome to the difference in pupation site choice behavior between these species. Using a panel of X-chromosome deletions, we screened the majority of the X chromosome for causal loci, and identified two regions that explain a large proportion of the X-effect. We then used gene disruptions and RNAi to demonstrate the substantial effects of a single gene within each region: Fas2 and tilB. Finally, we show that differences in tilB expression underlie species differences in pupation site choice behavior, and that generally, pupation site choice behavior appears to be correlated with relative expression of this gene. Our results suggest that even complex, environmentally sensitive behaviors may evolve through changes to loci with large phenotypic effects.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBehaviors are complex traits that involve sensory detection, higher level processing, and a coordinated output by the nervous system. This level of processing is highly susceptible to environmentally induced variation. Because of their complexity and sensitivity, behaviors are difficult to study; as a result, we have very little understanding of the genes involved in behavioral variation. In this study, we use common laboratory fruit fly model, Drosophila, to address this gap and dissect the genetic underpinnings of an environmentally sensitive behavior that differs between species. We find that a significant amount of the phenotypic difference between species is explained by a single chromosome. We further show that just two genes on this chromosome account for a large majority of its effect, suggesting that the genetic basis of complex behavioral evolution may be simpler than anticipated. For one of these genes, we show that a species-level difference in gene expression is associated with the difference in behavior. Our results contribute to a growing number of studies identifying the genetic components of behavior. Ultimately, we hope to use these data to better predict the number, types, and effects of genetic mutations necessary for complex behaviors to evolve.",

    "abstract": "Globally hay is the preferred forage for stabled horses. Variable nutritional and hygienic quality stimulates pre-feeding soaking to reduce dust and nutrients to reduce respiratory and metabolic disorders in horses. However, this practice has potential negative impacts on horse health. The objectives of this study were to map the bacterial profile of different hays and determine how soaking alters this with the aim of recommending best practice when feeding fodder to stabled horses. Two meadow and one Perennial Ryegrass hays were soaked for 0, 1.5, 9 or 16 hours. Post treatment, hays were analysed for water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) and total aerobic bacteria (TVC), with differences determined using ANOVA and least significant difference. Bacteria were identified via genomic DNA extraction (V3 and V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene) and 16S library preparation according to the Illumina protocol. Differences in phyla and family operational taxonomic units within hay types were identified via paired t-tests on the DESeq2 normalised data and false discovery rates accounted for using Padj (P<0.05). Mean WSC losses g/kg DM (+/-SE) increased with soaking time being 30 (10.7), 72 (43.7), 80 (38.8) for 1.5, 9 and 16 hours soak respectively. No relationship existed between WSC leaching and bacteria content or profile. Grass type influenced bacterial profiles. Soaking altered the epiphytic bacterial profile across all hays and 9 hours soaking increased richness and Shannon diversity indices. Clustering of bacteria was seen between meadow hays which differed from perennial rye grass and this difference increased post soaking. The normal industry practice of soaking hay for 9 hours pre-feeding cannot be recommended as it increases total bacteria content with noted increases of some potential pathogens. The alterations in bacteria profile and hygienic quality may explain why changing fodder or pre-feeding treatments can frequently precipitate colic in horses.",

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that a single application of the growth factors ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) or fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) to the crushed optic nerve of the frog, Rana pipiens, increases the numbers and elongation rate of regenerating retinal ganglion cell axons. Here we investigate the effects of these factors on the numbers and types of macrophages that invade the regeneration zone. In control PBS-treated nerves, many macrophage-like cells are present 100 m distal to the crush site at 1 week after injury; their numbers halve by 2 weeks. A single application of CNTF at the time of injury triples the numbers of macrophages at 1 week, with this increase compared to control being maintained at 2 weeks. Application of FGF-2 is equally effective at 1 week, but the macrophage numbers have fallen to control levels at 2 weeks. Immunostaining with a pan-macrophage marker, ED1, and a marker for M2-like macrophages, Arg-1, showed that the proportion of the putative M2 phenotype remained at approximately 80% with all treatments. Electron microscopy of the macrophage-like cells at 1 week shows strong phagocytic activity with all treatments, with many vacuoles containing axon fragments and membrane debris. At 2 weeks with PBS or FGF-2 treatment the remaining macrophage-like cells are less phagocytically active, containing mainly lipid inclusions. With CNTF treatment, at 2 weeks many of the more numerous macrophages are still phagocytosing axonal debris, although they also contain lipid inclusions. We conclude that the increase in macrophage influx seen after growth factor application is beneficial for the regenerating axons, probably due to more extensive removal of degenerating distal axons, but also perhaps to secretion of growth-promoting substances.",

The results demonstrated that UTI treatment significantly attenuated the wet/dry weight ratio, downregulated the levels of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), inhibited macrophage infiltration, and improved the average weight of rats. The most significant changes were observed in high-dose UTI treatment group. However, UTI had no effect on pulmonary superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels.

    "abstract": "Proteinuria is strongly associated with kidney disease progression but the mechanisms underlying podocyte handling of serum proteins such as albumin and IgG remain to be elucidated. We have previously shown that albumin and IgG are transcytosed by podocytes in vitro. In other epithelial cells, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is required to salvage albumin and IgG from the degradative pathway thereby allowing these proteins to be transcytosed or recycled. Here we directly examine the role of FcRn in albumin and IgG trafficking in podocytes by studying handling of these proteins in FcRn knockout (KO) podocytes in vitro and in a podocyte-specific FcRn knockout mice in vivo. In vitro, we find that knockout of FcRn leads to IgG accumulation in podocytes but does not alter albumin trafficking. Similarly, in vivo, podocyte-specific knockout of FcRn does not result in albumin accumulation in podocytes in vivo as measured by mean albumin fluorescence intensity whereas these mice demonstrate significant intraglomerular accumulation of IgG over time. In addition we find that podocyte-specific FcRn KO mice demonstrate mesangial expansion as they age and activation of mesangial cells as demonstrated by increased expression of -smooth muscle actin. Taken together, these results suggest that trafficking pathways for albumin and IgG differ in podocytes and that sustained disruption of trafficking of plasma proteins alters glomerular structure.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInfections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae (CR-Ecl) have been increasingly reported in the clinical setting; here we describe the clinical and molecular characteristics of CR-Ecl infections in a KPC endemic region.\\n\\nMethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in five tertiary-care hospitals in Medellin-Colombia. All patients infected by CR-Ecl from June-2012 to June-2014 were included. Sociodemographics and clinical information was retrieved from medical records. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, phenotypic and molecular carbapenemase detection were performed. Analysis of hsp60 and PFGE was done in a subset of isolates.\\n\\nResultsOf 109 patients enrolled, 60.55% (66/109) were infected with non-carbapenemase-producing-Ecl (non-CP-Ecl). CP-Ecl patients were frequently hospitalized in the ICU (37.21% vs 12.12%) and had exposure to carbapenems (39.53% vs 15.15%) compared to non-CP-Ecl infected patients. All-cause 30-day mortality was higher in CP-Ecl than non-CP-Ecl infected patients (27.91% vs 19.70%). CP-Ecl harbored KPC-2 (83.72%) and KPC-3 (6.97%). Analysis of hsp60 showed that CP-Ecl belonged primarily to cluster-VI of Enterobacter xiangfangensis (12/34) and cluster-XI (12/34) corresponding to E. cloacae subsp. cloacae. Non-CP-Ecl isolates belonged to cluster-VII/VIII (45/54), of E. hormaechi subsp. steigerwaltii. PFGE revealed isolates in cluster VII/VIII and XI were closely related within their own clusters.\\n\\nConclusionsThe results revealed a high frequency of non-CP-Ecl among the CR-Ecl infections in a KPC endemic region, displaying distinct clinical and molecular characteristics in comparison to CP-Ecl. The study highlights a significant contribution of non-CP-Ecl to the prevalence of CR-Ecl. Infection control measures to curtail dissemination of CR-Ecl should not only focus on CP-Ecl but should also include non-CP-Ecl.",

    "abstract": "Apicomplexans are a group of microbial eukaryotes that contain some of the most well-studied parasites, including widespread intracellular pathogens of mammals such as Toxoplasma and Plasmodium (the agent of malaria), and emergent pathogens like Cryptosporidium and Babesia. Decades of research have illuminated the pathogenic mechanisms, molecular biology, and genomics of model apicomplexans, but we know surprisingly little about their diversity and distribution in natural environments. In this study we analyze the distribution of apicomplexans across a range of both host-associated and free-living environments, covering animal hosts from cnidarians to mammals, and ecosystems from soils to fresh and marine waters. Using publicly available small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene databases, high-throughput environmental sequencing (HTES) surveys such as Tara Oceans and VAMPS, as well as our own generated HTES data, we developed an apicomplexan reference database, which includes the largest apicomplexan SSU rRNA tree available to date and encompasses comprehensive sampling of this group and their closest relatives. This tree allowed us to identify and correct incongruences in the molecular identification of sequences, particularly within the hematozoans and the gregarines. Analyzing the diversity and distribution of apicomplexans in HTES studies with this curated reference database also showed a widespread, and quantitatively important, presence of apicomplexans across a variety of free-living environments. These data allow us to describe a remarkable molecular diversity of this group compared with our current knowledge, especially when compared with that identified from described apicomplexan species. This revision is most striking in marine environments, where potentially the most diverse apicomplexans apparently exist, but have not yet been formally recognized. The new database will be useful for both microbial ecology and epidemiological studies, and provide valuable reference for medical and veterinary diagnosis especially in cases of emerging, zoonotic, and cryptic infections.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryApicomplexans are important animal and human parasites, but little is known about their distribution and diversity in the natural environment. We have developed a phylogenetically informed and manually curated reference database for the SSU rRNA barcode gene, and analyzed all publicly available sequences from a broad range of environments, providing a needed framework to analyze high-throughput environmental sequencing (HTES) data. The reference database and the amplicon sequences identified a striking diversity of apicomplexans in the environment, including habitats not usually associated with this group (e.g. open ocean). The phylogenetic framework will underpin microbial ecology studies and provide valuable resources for medical and veterinary biology.",

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA and DNA have been isolated from patient monocytes, an immune cell population that is quite different in several aspects from the canonical T-cell viral target. Because monocytes are migratory and resilient to both natural and synthetic antiviral defenses, knowledge of the contribution of monocyte infection to ongoing viral evolution and spread in vivo is of significant interest for drug development and treatment strategies. Using single viral genome sequencing from different peripheral blood compartments and phyloanatomic statistical inference, we demonstrate that productively infected monocytes follow an evolutionary trajectory that is distinct from peripheral T cells during multiple stages of disease progression. Gene flow and selection analysis reveal plasticity in the source of monocyte infection and in the region of the HIV envelope glycoprotein that experiences selection pressure across individuals. The findings, thus, point to a potential reservoir showing a range of infection and transmission dynamics, for which the current universal, T cell-targeted treatment strategies would be inadequate.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHuman immunodeficiency virus is a rapidly evolving virus, allowing its genetic material to act as a fingerprint for epidemiological processes among, as well as within, individual infected hosts. In this study, sampling of viral RNA from plasma and differing infected immune cell populations from the peripheral blood was undertaken for three separate individuals in order to infer such processes. The results revealed a productively infected monocyte cell population, for which distinct selection pressures were linked to differing spatiotemporal origins of infection. In light of previous evidence of the migratory nature of these cells and resilience to both natural and synthetic antiviral defenses, this study underscores the importance of further investigation into the role of monocytes, and monocyte-rich tissues, as viral reservoirs during treatment of HIV with antiretroviral therapy.",

    "abstract": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous {beta}-herpesvirus that establishes life-long latent infection in a high percentage of the population worldwide. CMV induces the strongest and most durable CD8+ T cell response known in human clinical medicine. Due to its unique properties, the virus represents a promising candidate vaccine vector for the induction of persistent cellular immunity. To take advantage of this, we constructed a recombinant murine CMV (MCMV) expressing an MHC-I restricted epitope from influenza A virus (IAV) H1N1 within the immediate early 2 (ie2) gene. Only mice that were immunized intranasally (i.n.) were capable of controlling IAV infection, despite the greater potency of the intraperitoneally (i.p.) vaccination in inducing a systemic IAV-specific CD8+ T cell response. The protective capacity of the i.n. immunization was associated with its ability to induce IAV-specific tissue-resident memory CD8+ T (CD8TRM) cells in the lungs. Our data demonstrate that the protective effect exerted by the i.n. immunization was critically mediated by antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. CD8TRM cells promoted the induction of IFN{gamma} and chemokines that facilitate the recruitment of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells to the lungs. Overall, our results showed that locally applied MCMV vectors could induce mucosal immunity at sites of entry, providing superior immune protection against respiratory infections.\\n\\nAuthor summaryVaccines against influenza typically induce immune responses based on antibodies, small molecules that recognize the virus particles outside of cells and neutralize them before they infects a cell. However, influenza rapidly evolves, escaping immune recognition, and the fastest evolution is seen in the part of the virus that is recognized by antibodies. Therefore, every year we are confronted with new flu strains that are not recognized by our antibodies against the strains from previous years. The other branch of the immune system is made of killer T cells, which recognize infected cells and target them for killing. Influenza does not rapidly evolve to escape T cell killing; thus, vaccines inducing T-cell responses to influenza might provide long-term protection. We introduced antigen from influenza into the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and used it as a vaccine vector inducing Killer T-cell responses of unparalleled strength. Our vector controlled flu replication and provided relief to infected mice, but only if we administered it through the nose, to activate killer T cells that will persist in the lungs close to the airways. Therefore, our data show that the subset of lung-resident killer T cells is sufficient to protect against influenza.",

    "abstract": "The use of 16S next generation sequencing (NGS) technology to identify the relative abundance of microbial communities have become the standard when studying the intestinal microbiome. The increased use is due to the ability to identify a proportion of bacteria that cannot be observed with culture-based methods. However, culture-based techniques are acceptable to identify key bacterial groups, yet may grossly underestimate the microbial community in question. Since there is limited research comparing NGS results to colony forming units (CFU), the objective of this study was to compare total Enterobacteriaceae and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) recovery with culture techniques (CFU/g ceca) to total number of reads from operational taxonomic units (OTU) categorized as Enterobacteriaceae or LAB from Illumina MiSeq platform from matched chick cecal samples at three and 10 days of age. Both CFU recovery (1.09x109 {+/-} 2.42x108; 1.37x108 {+/-} 5.57x107) and reads (5460 {+/-} 1164; 282 {+/-} 163) belonging to Enterobacteriaceae decreased by 10 days of age (p < 0.001). Similarly, LAB reads decreased over time (21,128 {+/-} 2262; 6220 {+/-} 817, respectively p < 0.0001). However, LAB CFU recovery increased by 10 days (1.18x108 {+/-} 1.91x107; 1.62x109 {+/-} 5.00x108, respectively p < 0.01). At three days the Pearsons correlation was -0.082 between CFU of culturable Enterobacteriaceae to reads and culturable LAB CFU to reads at 0.097, showing no correlation (p = 0.606, 0.551; respectively). By 10 days, no correlation of reads and CFU occurred with Enterobacteriaceae (r=-0.049; p-value = 0.769) while with LAB the correlation was 0.290 (p = 0.066) at 10 days. The CFU may be appropriate to identify a few families that change due to treatment or product. Without identifying viable cells to DNA recovered from NGS, there will always be the question whether the reads within the binned OTU in the intestinal tract is accurate.",

Within more than 1500 publications that were screened a total of 349 where analyzed.\\n\\nA total of 12/3.4% reported field-based evidence, and 41/11.7% covered modification stretagies efficacy after insects release, their epidemiology impact or its long-term efficacy. Examples of successful results were the replacement of natural field populations by wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in 5 weeks, and the elimination of a population in laboratory cages after transgenic mosquitoes release over 10-20 weeks. Variability in the effective results were described (90/25.7%) questioning its reproducibility in different settings. We also found 38/10.9% publications reporting reversal outcomes, such as an increase of vector population after release. Ecological effects such as horizontal transfer events to non-target species (54/15.5%), and wolbachia-induced worsening pathogenesis on mammal filarial diseases (10/2.9%) were also reported.\\n\\nPresent work revealed promising outcomes of both suppressing and replacing approaches. However, it also revealed a need of field-based evidence mainly regarding epidemiologic and long-term impact of insect modification strategies. It pointed out some eventual irreversible and important effects that must not be ignored when considering open-field releases, and that may constitute constraints to generate the missing field evidence. Moreover, the level of variability of existing evidence suggests the need of local/specific evidence in each setting of an eventual release.\\n\\nAuthor summaryInnovative strategies are needed to arrest the unprecedented increase of vector-borne disease incidence, distribution and severity. Several modification techniques are being tried all over the world. However this is still an emergent topic with scarce available information and of complex understanding.\\n\\nPresent work is the unique structured review regarding the use of modified insects for vector-borne disease prevention, bringing neutral and robust evidence that will contribute with critical insights regarding these approaches.\\n\\nHere we explored more than 1200 publications and analyzed 349 publications on this subject, describing the actual efficacy and reported effects of several modification strategies. More than 30 categories were reported such as, the type of modification, the year of the publication, the species were results were tested, the type of study, and also type of Efficacy Outcome (from modification to long-term) and/or the type of Effects Outcome (from physiologic to ecologic effects). Analysis revealed promising outcomes regarding vector-control and disease prevention. However insects modification strategies still lack field-based evidence mainly regarding epidemiological and long-term efficacy. Eventual reversal outcomes on disease transmission, or irreversible biological effects (including horizontal transfer to non-target species or worsening pathogenesis in particular diseases in mammals), were also described. These effects need to be explored, dispelled or resolved before field trials occur in human residential areas. Some of these questions could only have a robust answer if these strategies would be implemented, needing to take the risk to observe reversal outcomes and/or irreversible effects. These findings reflect the big dilemma that is under the use of modified insects to prevent vector-borne diseases. Findings could support health authorities in decision-making and regulatory committees during advisory processes, by evaluating the pros/cons of each modifying technique for a particular setting. Moreover they could also summarize what is crucial to inform to communities if planning open field releases in residential areas.",

Garden asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.) is an ideal species to test this hypothesis, as the X and Y chromosomes are cytologically homomorphic and recently evolved from an ancestral autosome pair in association with a shift from hermaphroditism to dioecy. Mutagenesis screens paired with singlemolecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) directly implicate Y-specific genes that respectively suppress female organ development and are necessary for male gametophyte development. Comparison of contiguous X and Y chromosome shows that loss of recombination between the genes suppressing female function (SUPPRESSOR OF FEMALE FUNCTION, SOFF) and promoting male function (TAPETAL DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTION 1, aspTDF1) is due to hemizygosity. We also experimentally demonstrate the function of aspTDF1.

We found significant sources of experimental error in 1) the time for initial adjustment when placing a leaf in the leaf chamber 2) the time-of-day when measuring 3) leaf age 4) having the chamber window full vs. partially full with leaf tissue 5) using a leaf chamber environment that greatly diverges from the whole plant environment 6) differing degree of experimental error depending upon plant species. A situation with multiple contributors to error would result in useless gas-exchange data. Recommendations for minimizing these experimental errors are given.",

    "abstract": "Trace elements such as copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn) are enzyme cofactors and second messengers in cell signaling. Trace elements are emerging as key regulators of differentiation and development of mammalian tissues including blood, brain, and skeletal muscle. We previously reported an influx of Cu and dynamic expression of various metal transporters during differentiation of skeletal muscle cells. Here, we demonstrate that during differentiation of skeletal myoblasts an increase of additional trace elements such as Mn, Fe and Zn occurs. Interestingly the Mn increase is concomitant with increased Mn-dependent SOD2 levels. To better understand the Mn import pathway in skeletal muscle cells, we probed the functional relevance of the closely related proteins ZIP8 and ZIP14, which are implicated in Zn, Mn, and Fe transport. Partial depletion of ZIP8 severely impaired growth of myoblasts and led to cell death under differentiation conditions, indicating that ZIP8-mediated metal transport is essential in skeletal muscle cells. Moreover, knockdown of Zip8 impaired activity of the Mn-dependent SOD2. Growth defects were partially rescued by Mn supplementation to the medium, suggesting additional functions for ZIP8 in the skeletal muscle lineage. Knockdown of Zip14, on the other hand, had only a mild effect on myotube size, consistent with a role for ZIP14 in muscle hypertrophy. This is the first report on the functional relevance of two members of the ZIP family of metal transporters in the skeletal muscle lineage, and further supports the paradigm that trace metal transporters are critical modulators of mammalian tissue development.",

    "abstract": "The nucleosome is the fundamental packaging unit for the genome. It must both remain tightly wound to ensure genome stability while simultaneously being flexible enough to keep the DNA molecule accessible for genome function. The set of physicochemical interactions responsible for the delicate balance between these naturally opposed processes have not been determined due to challenges in resolving partially unwound nucleosome configurations at atomic resolution. Using a near atomistic protein-DNA model and advanced sampling techniques, we calculate the free energy cost of nucleosome DNA unwinding. Our simulations identify a large energetic barrier that decouples the outer and inner DNA unwinding into two separate processes, occurring on different timescales. This dynamical decoupling allows the exposure of outer DNA at a modest cost to ensure accessibility while keeping the inner DNA and the histone core intact to maintain stability. We also reveal that this energetic barrier arises from a delayed loss of contacts between disordered histone tails and the DNA, and is, surprisingly, largely offset by an entropic contribution from these tails. Our study uncovers the balance of energetic and entropic contributions that dictate nucleosome stability, suggesting that tilting this balance may be a previously-unknown mechanism for regulating genome function.",

FBXW7 promotes mitotic cell death and prevents premature escape from mitosis through mitotic slippage. Mitotic slippage is a process that can cause chemoresistance and tumor relapse. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that regulate the balance between mitotic cell death and mitotic slippage is an important task. Here we report that FBXW7 protein levels markedly decline during extended mitotic arrest. FBXO45 binds to a conserved acidic N-terminal motif of FBXW7 specifically under a prolonged delay in mitosis, leading to ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of FBXW7 by the FBXO45-MYCBP2 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Moreover, we find that FBXO45-MYCBP2 counteracts FBXW7 in that it promotes mitotic slippage and prevents cell death in mitosis. Targeting this interaction represents a promising strategy to prevent chemotherapy resistance.",

This system provides a rare opportunity to study how signaling proteins natively gain distinct function.

To reconcile these in vivo findings with prior in vitro results that showed GacA was promiscuous, we developed a full kinetic model combining experimental data and mathematical modeling to reveal mechanisms that contribute to in vivo specificity. A 1.4 [A]-resolution crystal structure of the Geobacter Hypr GGDEF domain was determined to understand the molecular basis for those mechanisms, including key cross-dimer interactions. Together these results demonstrate that specific signaling can result from a promiscuous enzyme.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTumor progression is accompanied by dramatic remodeling of the surrounding extracellular matrix leading to the formation of a tumor-specific ECM, which is often more collagen-rich and of increased stiffness. The altered ECM of the tumor supports cancer growth and metastasis, but it is unknown if this effect involves modulation of T cell activity. To investigate if a high-density tumor-specific ECM could influence the ability of T cells to kill cancer cells, we here studied how T cells respond to 3D culture in different collagen densities.\\n\\nMethodsT cells cultured in 3D conditions surrounded by a high or low collagen density were imaged using confocal fluorescent microscopy. The effects of the different collagen densities on T cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation were examined using flow cytometry. Cancer cell proliferation in similar 3D conditions was also measured. Triple-negative breast cancer specimens were analyzed for the number of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and for the collagen density. Whole-transcriptome analyses were applied to investigate in detail the effects of collagen density on T cells. Computational analyses were used to identify transcription factors involved in the collagen density-induced gene regulation. Observed changes were confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis.\\n\\nResultsT cell proliferation was significantly reduced in a high-density matrix compared to a low-density matrix and prolonged culture in a high-density matrix led to a higher ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells. The proliferation of cancer cells was unaffected by the surrounding collagen-density. Consistently, we observed a reduction in the number of infiltrating CD8+ T-cells in mammary tumors with high collagen-density indicating that collagen-density has a role in regulating T cell abundance in human breast cancer.\\n\\nWhole-transcriptome analysis of 3D-cultured T cells revealed that a high-density matrix induces downregulation of cytotoxic activity markers and upregulation of regulatory T cell markers. These transcriptional changes were predicted to involve autocrine TGF-B signaling and they were accompanied by an impaired ability of tumor-infiltrating T cells to kill autologous cancer cells.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study identifies a new immune modulatory mechanism, which could be essential for suppression of T cell activity in the tumor microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "The transmission and pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is disproportionately influenced by evolution in the five variable regions of the virus surface envelope glycoprotein (gp120). Insertions and deletions (indels) are a significant source of evolutionary change in these regions. However, the influx of indels relative to nucleotide substitutions has not yet been quantified through a comparative analysis of HIV-1 sequence data. Here we develop and report results from a phylogenetic method to estimate indel rates for the gp120 variable regions across five major subtypes and two circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) of HIV-1 group M. We processed over 26,000 published HIV-1 gp120 sequences, from which we extracted 6,605 sequences for phylogenetic analysis. In brief, our method employs maximum likelihood to reconstruct phy-logenies scaled in time and fits a Poisson model to the observed distribution of indels between closely related pairs of sequences in the tree (cherries). The rate estimates ranged from 3.0 x 10-5 to 1.5 x 10-3 indels/nt/year and varied significantly among variable regions and subtypes. Indel rates were significantly lower in the region encoding variable loop V3, and also lower for HIV-1 subtype B relative to other subtypes. We also found that variable loops V1, V2 and V4 tended to accumulate significantly longer indels. Further, we observed that the nucleotide composition of indel sequences was significantly distinct from that of the flanking sequence in HIV-1 gp120. Indels affected potential N-linked glycosylation sites substantially more often in V1 and V2 than expected by chance, which is consistent with positive selection on glycosylation patterns within these regions of gp120. These results represent the first comprehensive measures of indel rates in HIV-1 gp120 across multiple subtypes and CRFs, and identifies novel and unexpected patterns for further research in the molecular evolution of HIV-1.",

These Gibbs energies can be measured directly via the careful design of experiments or can be computed from the curated Gibbs free energy databases. However, the computed Gibbs free energies of reactions and formations do not satisfy the thermodynamic constraints due to the compounding effect of measurement errors in the experimental data. The propagation of these errors can lead to a false prediction of pathway feasibility and uncertainty in the estimation of thermodynamic parameters.\\n\\nResultsThis work proposes a data reconciliation framework for thermodynamically consistent estimation of Gibbs free energies of reaction, formation and group contributions from experimental data. In this framework, we formulate constrained optimization problems that reduce measurement errors and their effects on the estimation of Gibbs energies such that the thermodynamic constraints are satisfied. When a subset of Gibbs free energies of formations is unavailable, it is shown that the accuracy of their resulting estimates is better than that of existing empirical prediction methods. Moreover, we also show that the estimation of group contributions can be improved using this approach. Further, we provide guidelines based on this approach for performing systematic experiments to estimate unknown Gibbs formation energies.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe MATLAB code for the executing the proposed algorithm is available for free on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/samansalike/DR-thermo\\n\\nContactniravbhatt@iitm.ac.in",

    "abstract": "Functional neuroimaging studies have attempted to explore brain activity that occurs with tic occurrence in subjects with Tourette syndrome (TS). However, they are limited by the difficulty of disambiguating brain activity required to perform a tic, or activity caused by the tic, from brain activity that generates a tic. Inhibiting the urge to tic is important to patients experience of tics and we hypothesize that inhibition of a compelling motor response to a natural urge will differ in TS subjects compared to controls. This study examines the urge to blink, which shares many similarities to premonitory urges to tic. Previous neuroimaging studies with the same hypothesis have used a one-size-fits-all approach to extract brain signal putatively linked to the urge to blink. We aimed to create a subject-specific and blink-timing-specific pathophysiological model, derived from out-of-scanner blink suppression trials, to eventually better interpret blink suppression fMRI data. Eye closure and continuously self-reported discomfort were reported during five blink suppression trials in 30 adult volunteers, 15 with a chronic tic disorder. For each subject, data from four of the trials were used with an empirical mathematical model to predict discomfort from eye closure observed during the remaining trial. The blink timing model of discomfort during blink suppression predicted observed discomfort much better than previously applied models. However, so did a model that simply reflected the mean time-discomfort curves from each subjects other trials. The TS group blinked more than twice as often during the blink suppression block, and reported higher baseline discomfort, smaller excursion from baseline to peak discomfort during the blink suppression block, and slower return of discomfort to baseline during the recovery block. Combining this approach with observed eye closure during fMRI blink suppression trials should therefore extract brain signal more tightly linked to the urge to blink.",

However, one of them, TgCentrin2 (CEN2), is also targeted to ring-shaped structures at the apical and basal ends of the parasite, as well as to multiple annuli at the junction between the apical cap and the rest of the membrane cortex. The role(s) that TgCentrin2 plays in these locations was unknown. Here we report the functional characterization of TgCentrin2 in the parasite lytic cycle. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to knock out or knock down the TgCentrin2 gene with existing tools, we designed a new conditional knockdown method that combines transcriptional and protein stability control to achieve tight regulation of TgCentrin2 levels in the parasite. We discovered that under knockdown conditions, there was an ordered loss of TgCentrin2 from its four compartments, due to differences in incorporation kinetics and structural inheritance over successive generations. This was correlated with the development of major invasion deficiency at early stages of CEN2 knockdown, and replication defects at later stages. These results indicate that TgCentrin2 is incorporated into multiple cytoskeletal structures to serve distinct functions in T. gondii that are required for parasite survival.",

    "abstract": "Phage therapy is attracting growing interest among clinicians as antibiotic resistance continues becoming harder to control. However, clinical trials and animal model studies on bacteriophage treatment are still scarce and results on the efficacy vary. Recent research suggests that using traditional antimicrobials in concert with phage could have desirable synergistic effects that hinder the evolution of resistance. Here, we present a novel insect gut model to study phage-antibiotic interaction in a system where antibiotic resistance initially exists in very low frequency and phage specifically targets the resistance bearing cells. We demonstrate that while phage therapy could not reduce the frequency of target bacteria in the population during positive selection by antibiotics, it alleviated the antibiotic induced blooming by lowering the overall load of resistant cells. The highly structured gut environment had pharmacokinetic effects on both phage and antibiotic dynamics compared to in vitro: antibiotics did not reduce the overall amount of bacteria, demonstrating a simple turnover of gut flora from non-resistant to resistant population with little cost. The results imply moderate potential for using phage as an aid to target antibiotic resistant gut infections, and question the usefulness of in vitro inferences.",
