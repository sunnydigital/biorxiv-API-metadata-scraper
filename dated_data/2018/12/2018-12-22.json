    "abstract": "Meiotic homolog pairing involves associations between homologous DNA regions scattered along the length of a chromosome. When homologs associate, they tend to do so by a processive zippering processive, which apparently results from avidity effects. Using a computational model, we show that this avidity-driven processive zippering reduces the selectivity of pairing. When active random forces are applied to telomeres, this drop in selectivity is eliminated in a force-dependent manner. Further simulations suggest that active telomere forces are engaged in a tug-of-war against zippering, which can be interpreted as a Brownian ratchet with a stall force that depends on the dissociation constant of pairing. When perfectly homologous regions of high affinity compete with homeologous regions of lower affinity, the affinity difference can be amplified through this tug of war effect provided the telomere force acts in a range that is strong enough to oppose zippering of homeologs while still permitting zippering of correct homologs. The degree of unzippering depends on the radius of the nucleus, such that complete unzippering of homeologous regions can only take place if the nucleus is large enough to pull the two chromosomes completely apart. A picture of meiotic pairing thus emerges that is fundamentally mechanical in nature, possibly explaining the purpose of active telomere forces, increased nuclear diameter, and the presence of \\\"Maverick\\\" chromosomes in meiosis.",

    "abstract": "The pattern of molecular evolution varies among gene sites and genes in a genome. By taking into account the complex heterogeneity of evolutionary processes among sites in a genome, Bayesian infinite mixture models of genomic evolution enable robust phylogenetic inference. With large modern data sets, however, the computational burden of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques becomes prohibitive. Here, we have developed a variational Bayesian procedure to speed up the widely used PhyloBayes MPI program, which deals with the heterogeneity of amino acid profiles. Rather than sampling from the posterior distribution, the procedure approximates the (unknown) posterior distribution using a manageable distribution called the variational distribution. The parameters in the variational distribution are estimated by minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence. To examine performance, we analyzed three empirical data sets consisting of mitochondrial, plastid-encoded, and nuclear proteins. Our variational method accurately approximated the Bayesian phylogenetic tree, mixture proportions, and the amino acid propensity of each component of the mixture while using orders of magnitude less computational time.",

    "abstract": "Kinesin-1 is responsible for microtubule-based transport of numerous cellular cargoes. Here, we explored the regulation of kinesin-1 by MAP7 proteins. We found that all four mammalian MAP7 family members bind to kinesin-1. In HeLa cells, MAP7, MAP7D1 and MAP7D3 act redundantly to enable kinesin-1-dependent transport and microtubule recruitment of the truncated kinesin-1 KIF5B-560, which contains the stalk but not the cargo-binding and autoregulatory regions. In vitro, purified MAP7 and MAP7D3 increase microtubule landing rate and processivity of kinesin-1 through transient association with the motor. MAP7 proteins promote binding of kinesin-1 to microtubules both directly, through the N-terminal microtubule-binding domain and unstructured linker region, and indirectly, through an allosteric effect exerted by the kinesin-binding C-terminal domain. Compared to MAP7, MAP7D3 has a higher affinity for kinesin-1 and a lower affinity for microtubules and, unlike MAP7, can be co-transported with the motor. We propose that MAP7 proteins are microtubule-tethered kinesin-1 activators, with which the motor transiently interacts as it moves along microtubules.\\n\\nSummaryA combination of experiments in cells and in vitro reconstitution assays demonstrated that mammalian MAP7 family proteins act redundantly to activate kinesin-1 and promote its microtubule binding and processivity by transiently associating with the stalk region of the motor.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdvances in wildlife tracking technology have allowed researchers to understand the spatial ecology of many terrestrial and aquatic animal species. Argos Doppler is a technology that is widely used for wildlife tracking owing to the small size and low weight of the Argos transmitters. This allows them to be fitted to small-bodied species. The longer lifespan of the Argos units in comparison to units outfitted with miniaturized global positioning system (GPS) technology has also recommended their use. In practice, large Argos location errors often occur due to communication conditions such as transmitter settings, local environment, and the behavior of the tracked individual.\\n\\nMethodsConsidering the geographic specificity of errors and the lack of benchmark studies in Eastern Europe, the research objectives were: (1) to evaluate the accuracy of Argos Doppler technology under various environmental conditions in Romania, (2) to investigate the effectiveness of straightforward destructive filters for improving Argos Doppler data quality, and (3) to provide guidelines for processing Argos Doppler wildlife monitoring data. The errors associated with Argos locations in four geographic locations in Romania were assessed during static, low-speed and high-speed tests. The effectiveness of the Douglas Argos distance angle filter algorithm was then evaluated to ascertain its effect on the minimization of localization errors.\\n\\nResultsArgos locations received in the tests had larger associated horizontal errors than those indicated by the operator of the Argos system, including under ideal reception conditions. Positional errors were similar to those obtained in other studies outside of Europe. The errors were anisotropic, with larger longitudinal errors for the vast majority of the data. Errors were mostly related to speed of the Argos transmitter at the time of reception, but other factors such as topographical conditions and orientation of antenna at the time of the transmission also contributed to receiving low-quality data. The Douglas-Argos filter successfully excluded the largest errors while retaining a large amount of data when the threshold was set to the local scale (2 km).\\n\\nDiscussionFilter selection requires knowledge about the movement patterns and behavior of the species of interest, and the parametrization of the selected filter typically requires a trial and error approach. Selecting the proper filter reduces the errors while retaining a large amount of data. However, the post-processed data typically includes large positional errors; thus, we recommend incorporating Argos error metrics such as error ellipse or use complex modeling approaches when working with filtered data.",

    "abstract": "Spatial neglect is a common clinical syndrome involving disruption of the brains attention-related circuitry, including the dorsocaudal temporal cortex. While neglect is readily modeled in macaques, the absence of evidence for temporal cortex involvement has suggested a fundamental difference from humans. To map the neurological expression of spatial neglect in macaques, we measured attention-related fMRI activity across the cerebral cortex during experimental induction of neglect through reversible inactivation of the superior colliculus. During inactivation, monkeys exhibited hallmark attentional deficits of neglect in tasks using either moving or static stimuli. The behavioral deficits were accompanied by marked reductions in fMRI attentional modulation that were strongest in a small region on the floor of the superior temporal sulcus. Notably, direct inactivation of this mid-STS cortical region caused similar neglect-like spatial attention deficits. These results identify a putative macaque homolog to temporal cortex structures known to play a central role in human neglect.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDuring neglect the mid-STS cortex shows largest reduction in attentional modulation\\nC_LIO_LIThe mid-STS cortex is selectively affected with static as well as dynamic stimuli\\nC_LIO_LIMid-STS cortex is affected during neglect caused by SC or FEF inactivation\\nC_LIO_LIInactivation of mid-STS cortex itself causes neglect without eye movement deficits\\nC_LI\\n\\nIn BriefUsing fMRI in macaques performing attention tasks combined with reversible inactivations, Bogadhi et al. provide causal evidence that a region on the floor of the superior temporal sulcus is a crucial node in the cortical control of covert selective attention and a putative homolog to temporal cortex regions in humans implicated in spatial neglect.",

We validated the signatures performance in predicting survival in ten cancers using Cox regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.\\n\\nResultsSignature 1 and signature 2 were associated with good and poor overall survival respectively. Prognosis of signature 1 in 8 cohorts representing 6 cancers (n=2,627): bladder (hazard ratio [HR]=0.68, P=0.039), papillary renal cell (HR=0.35, P=0.013), liver (HR=0.64, P=0.033 and HR=0.49, P=0.025), lung (HR=0.66, P=0.014) and pancreatic (HR=0.42, P<0.001 and HR=0.64, P=0.04) and endometrial (HR=0.40, P<0.001).

Multivariate Cox regression confirmed independent clinical relevance of signatures in these cancers. ROC analyses confirmed superior performance of signatures to current tumor staging benchmarks. KDM8 is a potential tumor suppressor downregulated in liver and pancreatic cancers and is an independent prognostic factor. KDM8 expression negatively correlated with cell cycle regulators. Low KDM8 in tumors was associated with loss of cell adhesion phenotype through HNF4A signaling.\\n\\nConclusionsPan-cancer signatures of oxygen-sensing genes used for risk assessment in 10 cancers (n=6,761) could guide individualized treatment plans.",

    "abstract": "Genomes can vary within individual organisms. Programmed DNA elimination leads to dramatic changes in genome organisation during the germline-soma differentiation of ciliates1, lampreys2, nematodes3,4, and various other eukaryotes5. A particularly remarkable example of tissue-specific genome differentiation is the germline-restricted chromosome (GRC) in the zebra finch which is consistently absent from somatic cells6. Although the zebra finch is an important animal model system7, molecular evidence from its large GRC (>150 megabases) is limited to a short intergenic region8 and a single mRNA9. Here, we combined cytogenetic, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic evidence to resolve the evolutionary origin and functional significance of the GRC. First, by generating tissue-specific de-novo linked-read genome assemblies and re-sequencing two additional germline and soma samples, we found that the GRC contains at least 115 genes which are paralogous to single-copy genes on 18 autosomes and the Z chromosome. We detected an amplification of [&ge;]38 GRC-linked genes into high copy numbers (up to 308 copies) but, surprisingly, no enrichment of transposable elements on the GRC. Second, transcriptome and proteome data provided evidence for functional expression of GRC genes at the RNA and protein levels in testes and ovaries. Interestingly, the GRC is enriched for genes with highly expressed orthologs in chicken gonads and gene ontologies involved in female gonad development. Third, we detected evolutionary strata of GRC-linked genes. Developmental genes such as bicc1 and trim71 have resided on the GRC for tens of millions of years, whereas dozens have become GRC-linked very recently. The GRC is thus likely widespread in songbirds (half of all bird species) and its rapid evolution may have contributed to their diversification. Together, our results demonstrate a highly dynamic evolutionary history of the songbird GRC leading to dramatic germline-soma genome differences as a novel mechanism to minimise genetic conflict between germline and soma.",

    "abstract": "To better understand the representations in visual cortex, we need to generate better predictions of neural activity in awake animals presented with their ecological input: natural video. Despite recent advances in models for static images, models for predicting responses to natural video are scarce and standard linear-nonlinear models perform poorly. We developed a new deep recurrent network architecture that predicts inferred spiking activity of thousands of mouse V1 neurons simulta-neously recorded with two-photon microscopy, while accounting for confounding factors such as the animals gaze position and brain state changes related to running state and pupil dilation. Powerful system identification models provide an opportunity to gain insight into cortical functions through in silico experiments that can subsequently be tested in the brain. However, in many cases this approach requires that the model is able to generalize to stimulus statistics that it was not trained on, such as band-limited noise and other parameterized stimuli. We investigated these domain transfer properties in our model and find that our model trained on natural images is able to correctly predict the orientation tuning of neurons in responses to artificial noise stimuli. Finally, we show that we can fully generalize from movies to noise and maintain high predictive performance on both stimulus domains by fine-tuning only the final layers weights on a network otherwise trained on natural movies. The converse, however, is not true.",

The sidearm of dynactin is essential for binding to microtubules and regulation of dynein activity.

Here, electron microscopy of individual molecules of the dynactin complex revealed that the sidearm was highly flexible and exhibited diverse morphologies. Utilizing mutants for nanogold labeling and deletion analysis, we determined the domain organization of the largest subunit p150 and identified a filamentous structure protruding from the head domain of the sidearm as the coiled-coil 1 (CC1), the dynein-binding domain, in p150. Furthermore, the protrusion formed by CC1 exhibited either a folded or an extended form, suggesting that CC1 works as an extending \\\"arm\\\".

Their topological structure includes nodes, edges, triangles and even higher-dimensional objects. Topological data analysis (TDA) is the emerging framework to process datasets under this perspective. In parallel, topology has proven essential for understanding fundamental questions in physics. Here we report the discovery of topological phase transitions in functional brain networks by merging concepts from TDA, topology, geometry, physics, and network theory. We show that topological phase transitions occur when the Euler entropy has a singularity, which remarkably coincides with the emergence of multidimensional topological holes in the brain network. Our results suggest that a major alteration in the pattern of brain correlations can modify the signature of such transitions, and may point to suboptimal brain functioning. Due to the universal character of phase transitions and noise robustness of TDA, our findings open perspectives towards establishing reliable topological and geometrical biomarkers of individual and group differences in functional brain network organization.",

These impairments have been associated with alterations in EEG measures of power spectrum and event-related potentials, however the impact of sleep loss on inter trial phase coherence (ITPC), a measure of phase consistency over experimental trials, remains mostly unknown. ITPC is thought to reflect the ability of the neural response to temporally synchronize with relevant events, thus optimizing information processing.\\n\\nIn the current study we investigated the effects of sleep deprivation on information processing by evaluating the phase consistency of steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) as well as amplitude-based measures of ssVEP, obtained from a group of 18 healthy individuals following 24 hours of total sleep deprivation and after a night of habitual sleep. An ssVEP task was utilized, which included the presentation of dots flickering at 7.5 Hz, along with a cognitive-emotional task. Our results show that ITPC is significantly reduced under sleep deprivation relative to habitual sleep. Interestingly, decreased ITPC under sleep deprivation was associated with decreased behavioral performance in the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), a validate measure of reduced vigilance following lack of sleep.\\n\\nThe results suggest that the capability of the brain to synchronize with rhythmic stimuli is disrupted without sleep. Thus, decreased ITPC may represent an objective and mechanistic measure of sleep loss, allowing future work to study the relation between brain-world synchrony and the specific functional impairments associated with sleep deprivation.",

This nucleosome positioning (NP) feature provides an inherited epigenetic mark for sperm.

In this study, we examine the 3D organization of sperm chromatin and specifically determine its 3D localization of nucleosomes using structured illumination microscopy. A fraction of the sperm chromatin form nucleosome domains (NDs), visible as microscopic puncta ranging from 40 m to 700 m in diameter, and these NDs are precisely localized in the postacrosome region (PAR), outside the sperms core chromatin. Importantly, these types of NDs exist only in sperm from fertile men but not in sperm from sterile men. This study uncovers a new spatially restricted sub-nuclear structure containing NDs that are consistent with NPs of the sperm.

The non-cross validated correlation values of r2training = 0.89; predictive r2test = 0.69 for CoMFA and r2=0.87; predictive r2test =0.67 for CoMSIA reflected the statistical significance of the developed model. The steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bond acceptor interactions have been found important in describing the variation in human SIRT1 activation. Further, 2D QSAR model for the same dataset yielded high statistical significance and derived 2D models parameters corroborated with 3D model in terms of features. The developed model was also validated through the available active conformation structure of SIRT1. Developed models may be useful for the identification of potential novel human SIRT1 activators as therapeutic agent.",

EEG signals are subject-specific, sensitive to disturbances, and have a low signal-to-noise ratio, which has been mitigated by the use of laboratory-grade EEG acquisition equipment under highly controlled conditions. In the present study, we investigate single-trial decoding of natural, complex stimuli based on scalp EEG acquired with a portable, 32 dry-electrode sensor system in a typical office setting. We probe generalizability by a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation approach. We demonstrate that Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained on a relatively small set of de-noised (averaged) pseudo-trials perform on par with classifiers trained on a large set of noisy single-trial samples. For visualization of EEG signatures exploited by SVM classifiers, we propose a novel method for computing sensitivity maps of EEG-based SVM classifiers. Moreover, we apply the NPAIRS resampling framework for estimation of map uncertainty and show that effect sizes of sensitivity maps for classifiers trained on small samples of de-noised data and large samples of noisy data are similar. Finally, we demonstrate that the average pseudo-trial classifier can successfully predict the class of single trials from withheld subjects, which allows for fast classifier training, parameter optimization and unbiased performance evaluation in machine learning approaches for brain decoding.",

Metacommunity ecology provides a framework for understanding how these processes combine to determine community composition among local sites that are regionally connected through dispersal. In 17 temperate seagrass meadows along the British Columbia coast, we tested the hypothesis that eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) epifaunal invertebrate assemblages are influenced by local environmental conditions, but that high dispersal rates at larger spatial scales dampen effects of environmental differences. We used hierarchical joint species distribution modelling to understand the contribution of environmental conditions, spatial distance between meadows, and species co-occurrences to epifaunal invertebrate abundance and distribution across the region. We found that patterns of taxonomic compositional similarity among meadows were inconsistent with dispersal limitation and meadows in the same region were often no more similar to each other than meadows over 1000 km away. Abiotic environmental conditions (temperature, dissolved oxygen) explained a small fraction of variation in taxonomic abundances patterns across the region. We found novel co-occurrence patterns among taxa that could not be explained by shared responses to environmental gradients, suggesting the possibility that interspecific interactions influence seagrass invertebrate abundance and distribution. Our results add to mounting evidence that suggests that the biodiversity and ecosystem functions provided by seagrass meadows reflect ecological processes occurring both within meadows and across seascapes, and suggest that management of eelgrass habitat for biodiversity may be most effective when both local and regional processes are considered.",

More complete pictures of the gene regulatory networks that control the production of the blood system have emerged with the advent of single-cell sequencing techniques and refinements to the capabilities of immunoassays. However, information about the regulatory networks of cytokines is still lacking. A novel mathematical technique (convergent cross-mapping, or CCM) allows for the extraction of causal relationships from data, which is of crucial importance for understanding these networks. To reconstruct the cytokine networks within the hematopoietic system we measured the concentrations of 62 cytokines, platelets, and thrombopoietin from an individual with cyclic thrombocytopenia (regular oscillations in the megakaryocytes and platelets) over 84 days. Using CCM, we identified 61 previously unreported cytokine relationships.

    "abstract": "SUMMARYAnoxygenic phototrophic sulfide oxidation by green and purple sulfur bacteria (PSB) plays a key role in sulfide removal from anoxic shallow sediments and stratified waters. Although some PSB can also oxidize sulfide with nitrate and oxygen, little is known about the prevalence of this chemolithotrophic lifestyle in the environment. In this study, we investigated the role of these phototrophs in light-independent sulfide removal in the chemocline of Lake Cadagno. Our temporally resolved, high-resolution chemical profiles indicated that dark sulfide oxidation was coupled to high oxygen consumption rates of ~9 M O2{middle dot}h-1. Single-cell analyses of lake water incubated with 13CO2 in the dark revealed that Chr. okenii was to a large extent responsible for aerobic sulfide oxidation and it accounted for up to 40 % of total dark carbon fixation. The genome of Chr. okenii reconstructed from the Lake Cadagno metagenome confirms its capacity for microaerophilic growth and provides further insights into its metabolic capabilities. Moreover, our genomic and single-cell data indicated that other PSB grow microaerobically in these apparently anoxic waters. Altogether, our observations suggest that aerobic respiration may not only play an underappreciated role in anoxic environments, but also that organisms typically considered strict anaerobes may be involved.\\n\\nORIGINALITY-SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis study reveals that dark aerobic sulfide oxidation within an anoxic layer dominated by anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria in the stratified water column of Lake Cadagno is to a large extent carried out by the anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium Chromatium okenii. Our findings imply that aerobic metabolisms may be more prevalent in anoxic zones than previously thought. We also present an environmental metagenome-assembled genome of Chr. okenii which is the first genome sequence for the genus Chromatium and reveals new interesting physiological features of this environmentally relevant organism, including its capacity for aerobic respiration.",

    "abstract": "During healthy brain aging, different brain regions show anatomical or functional declines at different rates, and some regions may show compensatory increases in functional activity. However, few studies have explored interregional influences of brain activity during the aging process. We proposed a causality analysis framework combining high dimensionality independent component analysis (ICA), Granger causality, and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression on longitudinal brain metabolic activity data measured by Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). We analyzed FDG-PET images from healthy old subjects, who were scanned for at least five sessions with an averaged intersession interval of about one year. The longitudinal data were concatenated across subjects to form a time series, and the first order autoregressive model was used to measure interregional causality among the independent sources of metabolic activity identified using ICA. Several independent sources with reduced metabolic activity in aging, including the anterior temporal lobe and orbital frontal cortex, demonstrated causal influences over many widespread brain regions. On the other hand, the influenced regions were more distributed, and had smaller age related declines or even relatively increased metabolic activity. The current data demonstrated interregional spreads of aging on metabolic activity at the scale of a year, and have identified key brain regions in the aging process that have strong influences over other regions.",

    "abstract": "Neomorphic, membrane-associated skeletal rods are found in disparate vertebrate lineages, but their evolution is poorly understood. Here we show that one of these elements--the calcar of bats (Chiroptera)--is a skeletal novelty that has anatomically diversified. Our comparisons of evolutionary models of calcar length and corresponding disparity-through-time analyses indicate that the calcar diversified early in the evolutionary history of Chiroptera, as bats systematically radiated after evolving the capacity for flight. We find interspecific variation in a variety of anatomical parameters of probable importance for calcar function, which suggests that adaptive advantages provided by the calcar led to its anatomical diversification. In addition to overall length, we find that the calcar varies among bats in its tissue composition, and a synovial joint is present at the articulation between the calcar and the calcaneus ankle bone in some species. This suggests the calcar has a kinematic functional role. Our results demonstrate that novel skeletal additions can become integrated into vertebrate body plans and subsequently evolve into a variety of forms, potentially impacting clade diversification by expanding the available morphological space into which organisms can evolve.",

We have proposed that the diffusible cue UNC-6(Netrin) is captured by UNC-40 (DCC) for a short-range interaction with UNC-5 to trigger self-avoidance in the C. elegans PVD neuron. Here we report that the actin-polymerizing proteins UNC-34(Ena/VASP), WSP-1(WASP), UNC-73(Trio), MIG-10(Lamellipodin) and the Arp2/3 complex effect dendrite retraction in the self-avoidance response mediated by UNC-6(Netrin). The paradoxical idea that actin polymerization results in shorter rather than longer dendrites is explained by our finding that NMY-1 (non-muscle myosin II) is necessary for retraction and could therefore mediate this effect in a contractile mechanism. Our results also show that dendrite length is determined by the antagonistic effects on the actin cytoskeleton of separate sets of effectors for retraction mediated by UNC-6(Netrin) versus outgrowth promoted by the DMA-1 receptor. Thus, our findings suggest that the dendrite length depends on an intrinsic mechanism that balances distinct modes of actin assembly for growth versus retraction.",

This finding could indicate that inferred motion direction can penetrate sensory processing and impact perception. Equally possible, however, is that inferred motion impacts decision processes, but not perception. Here we test these two possibilities. Since both categorical decisions and subjective confidence are informed by sensory information, confidence can be informative about whether an aftereffect likely results from changes to perceptual or decision processes. We therefore leveraged subjective confidence as an additional measure of the implied motion aftereffect. In Experiment 1 (implied motion), we find support for decision-level changes only, with no change in subjective confidence. In Experiment 2 (real motion), we find equal changes to decisions and confidence. Our results suggest the implied motion aftereffect produces a bias in decision-making, but leaves perceptual processing unchanged.",

Fully-grown oocytes, having a large nucleus called the germinal vesicle, arrest at meiotic prophase-I. Upon hormonal stimulus, oocytes resume meiosis to acquire fertilizability. At this time, pHi increases through Na+/H+ exchanger activity. However, regulation and function of this change remains obscure. Here we show that in starfish oocytes, serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK) is activated by the PI3K/TORC2/PDK1 signaling after hormonal stimulus, and is required for the pHi increase and cyclin B-Cdk1 activation. Furthermore, when we clamped pHi at 6.7, corresponding to the pHi of unstimulated ovarian oocytes, hormonal stimulus normally induced cyclin B-Cdk1 activation; thereafter, oocytes initiated germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), but failed to complete it. Thus, SGK-dependent pHi increase is likely prerequisite for completion of GVBD in ovarian oocytes. We propose a model that SGK drives meiotic resumption through concomitant regulation of pHi and the cell-cycle machinery.",

Similarly, comprehensive descriptions of such models encoded in computable form help to ensure that such models are accessible, discoverable, and reusable. To this end, researchers have developed tools and standards to encode mathematical models of biological systems enabling reproducibility and reuse; tools and guidelines to facilitate semantic description of mathematical models; and repositories in which to archive, share, and discover models. Biologists and clinicians can leverage these resources to investigate specific questions and hypotheses.\\n\\nResultsWe have comprehensively annotated a cohort of models with biological semantics. These annotated models are freely available in the Physiome Model Repository (PMR). To demonstrate the benefits of this approach, we have developed a web-based tool which enables users to discover models relevant to their work, with a particular focus on epithelial transport. In helping a user to discover relevant models this tool will provide users with suggestions for similar or alternative models they may wish to explore or utilize in their model based on the models they would like to use. The semantic annotation and the web tool we have developed is a new contribution enabling scientists to discover relevant models in the PMR as candidates for reuse in their own scientific endeavours.

The mechanism by which H2B-Ub stimulates Dot1L to methylate the relatively inaccessible histone core H3K79 residue is unknown. The 3.0 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of Dot1L bound to ubiquitinated nucleosome reveals that Dot1L contains binding sites for both ubiquitin and the histone H4 tail, which establish two regions of contact that stabilize a catalytically competent state and positions the Dot1L active site over H3K79. We unexpectedly find that contacts mediated by both Dot1L and the H4 tail induce a conformational change in the globular core of histone H3 that reorients K79 from an inaccessible position, thus enabling this side chain to project deep into the active site in a position primed for catalysis. Our study provides a comprehensive mechanism of cross-talk between histone ubiquitination and methylation and reveals an unexpected structural plasticity in histones that makes it possible for histone-modifying enzymes to access residues within the nucleosome core.",

    "abstract": "The kinase cyclin B-Cdk1 complex is a master regulator of M-phase in both mitosis and meiosis. At the G2/M transition, cyclin B-Cdk1 activation is initiated by a trigger that reverses the balance of activities between Cdc25 and Wee1/Myt1, and is further accelerated by autoregulatory loops. In somatic cell mitosis, this trigger was recently proposed to be the cyclin A-Cdk1/Plk1 axis. However, in the oocyte meiotic G2/M transition, in which hormonal stimuli induce cyclin B-Cdk1 activation, cyclin A-Cdk1 is non-essential and hence the trigger remains elusive. Here, we show that SGK directly phosphorylates Cdc25 and Myt1 to trigger cyclin B-Cdk1 activation in starfish oocytes. After hormonal stimulation of the meiotic G2/M transition, SGK is activated by cooperation between the G{beta}{gamma}-PI3K pathway and an unidentified pathway downstream of G{beta}{gamma}, called the atypical G{beta}{gamma} pathway. These findings identify the trigger in oocyte meiosis and provide insights into the role and activation of SGK.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is a progressive and devastating neurodegenerative condition for which there are no effective treatments. Understanding the molecular pathology of AD during disease progression may identify new ways to reduce neuronal damage. Here, we present a longitudinal study tracking dynamic proteomic alterations in the brains of an inducible Drosophila melanogaster model of AD expressing the Arctic mutant A{beta}42 gene. We identified 3093 proteins from flies that were induced to express A{beta}42 and age-matched healthy controls using label-free quantitative ion-mobility data independent analysis mass spectrometry. Of these, 228 proteins were significantly altered by A{beta}42 accumulation and were enriched for AD-associated processes. Network analyses further revealed that these proteins have distinct hub and bottleneck properties in the brain protein interaction network, suggesting that several may have significant effects on brain function. Our unbiased analysis provides useful insights into the key processes governing the progression of amyloid toxicity and forms a basis for further functional analyses in model organisms and translation to mammalian systems.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSuper-resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging (SOFI) offers a simple and affordable alternative to other super-resolution (SR) imaging techniques. The theoretical resolution enhancement of SOFI scales linearly with the cumulants order, while imaging conditions are less phototoxic to living samples as compared to other SR methods. High order SOFI could, therefore, be a method of choice for dynamic live cell imaging. However, due to cusp-artifacts and to dynamic range expansion of pixel intensities, this promise has not been materialized as of yet. Here we investigated and compared high order moments vs. high order cumulants SOFI reconstructions. We demonstrate that even-order moments reconstructions are intrinsically free of cusp artifacts, allowing for a subsequent deconvolution operation to be performed, hence enhancing the resolution even further. High order moments reconstructions performance was examined for various (simulated) conditions and applied to (experimental) imaging of QD labeled microtubules in fixed cells, and actin stress fiber dynamics in live cells.",

    "abstract": "DNA damage response (DDR) and selective autophagy both can be activated by reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), and both are of paramount importance in cancer development. The selective autophagy receptor and ubiquitin (Ub) sensor p62 plays a key role in their crosstalk. ROS production has been well documented in latent infection of oncogenic viruses including Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). However, p62-mediated selective autophagy and its interplay with DDR have not been investigated in these settings. In this study, we provide evidence that considerable levels of p62-mediated selective autophagy are constitutively induced, and correlates with ROS-Keap1-NRF2 pathway activity, in virus-transformed cells. Inhibition of autophagy results in p62 accumulation in the nucleus, and promotes ROS-induced DNA damage and cell death, as well as downregulates the DNA repair proteins CHK1 and RAD51. In contrast, MG132-mediated proteasome inhibition, which induces rigorous autophagy, promotes p62 degradation but accumulation of the DNA repair proteins CHK1 and RAD51. However, pretreatment with an autophagy inhibitor offsets the effects of MG132 on CHK1 and RAD51 levels. These findings imply that p62 accumulation in the nucleus in response to autophagy inhibition promotes proteasome-mediated CHK1 and RAD51 protein instability. This claim is further supported by the findings that transient expression of a p62 mutant, which is constitutively localized in the nucleus, in B cell lines with low endogenous p62 levels recaptures the effects of autophagy inhibition on CHK1 and RAD51 protein stability. These results indicate that proteasomal degradation of RAD51 and CHK1 is dependent on p62 accumulation in the nucleus. However, small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated p62 depletion in EBV-transformed lymphoblastic cell lines (LCLs) had no apparent effects on the protein levels of CHK1 and RAD51, likely due to the constitutive localization of p62 in the cytoplasm and incomplete knockdown is insufficient to manifest the effects on its nuclear function. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated p62 depletion in EBV-transformed LCLs results in significant increases of endogenous RNF168-{gamma}H2AX damage foci and chromatin ubiquitination, indicative of activation of RNF168-mediated DNA repair mechanisms. Our results have unveiled a pivotal role for p62-mediated selective autophagy that governs DDR in the setting of oncogenic virus latent infection, and provide a novel insight into virus-mediated oncogenesis.\n\nAuthor SummaryReactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) can induce both DNA damage response (DDR) and selective autophagy, which play crucial roles in cancer development. The selective autophagy receptor and ubiquitin (Ub) sensor p62 links their crosstalk. However, p62-mediated selective autophagy and its interplay with DDR have not been investigated in latent infection of oncogenic viruses including Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). In this study, we provide evidence that p62-mediated selective autophagy is constitutively induced in virus-transformed cells, and that its inhibition exacerbates ROS-induced DNA damage, and promotes proteasomal degradation of CHK1 and RAD51 in a manner depending on p62 accumulation in the nucleus. However, rigorous autophagy induction results in accumulation of DNA repair proteins CHK1 and RAD51, and p62 degradation. Further, transient expression of a constitutive nucleus-localizing mutant of p62 recaptured the effects of autophagy inhibition on CHK1 and RAD51 protein stability. These findings support the claim that p62 accumulation in the nucleus in response to autophagy inhibition promotes proteasome-mediated CHK1 and RAD51 protein instability. However, small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated p62 depletion did not affect CHK1 and RAD51 protein levels; rather, shRNA-mediated p62 depletion activates RNF168-dependent DNA repair mechanisms. Our results have unveiled a pivotal role for p62-mediated selective autophagy in regulation of DDR by overriding traditional DDR mechanisms in the setting of oncogenic virus latent infection, and provide a novel insight into the etiology of viral cancers.",

    "abstract": "The increasing size and diversity of genome-wide association studies provide an exciting opportunity to study how the genetics of complex traits vary among diverse populations. Here, we introduce covariate-adjusted LD score regression (cov-LDSC), a method to accurately estimate genetic heritability [Formula] and its enrichment in both homogenous and admixed populations with summary statistics and in-sample LD estimates. In-sample LD can be estimated from a subset of the GWAS samples, allowing our method to be applied efficiently to very large cohorts. In simulations, we show that unadjusted LDSC underestimates [Formula] by 10% - 60% in admixed populations; in contrast, cov-LDSC is robust to all simulation parameters. We apply cov-LDSC to genotyping data from approximately 170,000 Latino, 47,000 African American and 135,000 European individuals. We estimate [Formula] and detect heritability enrichment in three quantitative and five dichotomous phenotypes respectively, making this, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive heritability-based analysis of admixed individuals. Our results show that most traits have high concordance of [Formula] and consistent tissue-specific heritability enrichment among different populations. However, for age at menarche, we observe population-specific heritability estimates of [Formula]. We observe consistent patterns of tissue-specific heritability enrichment across populations; for example, in the limbic system for BMI, the per-standardized-annotation effect size{tau} * is 0.16 {+/-} 0.04, 0.28 {+/-} 0.11 and 0.18 {+/-} 0.03 in Latino, African American and European populations respectively. Our results demonstrate that our approach is a powerful way to analyze genetic data for complex traits from underrepresented populations.\n\nAuthor summaryAdmixed populations such as African Americans and Hispanic Americans bear a disproportionately high burden of disease but remain underrepresented in current genetic studies. It is important to extend current methodological advancements for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits in homogeneous populations to individuals with admixed genetic backgrounds. Here, we develop a computationally efficient method to answer two specific questions. First, does genetic variation contribute to the same amount of phenotypic variation (heritability) across diverse populations? Second, are the genetic mechanisms shared among different populations? To answer these questions, we use our novel method to conduct the first comprehensive heritability-based analysis of a large number of admixed individuals. We show that there is a high degree of concordance in total heritability and tissue-specific enrichment between different ancestral groups. However, traits such as age at menarche show a noticeable differences among populations. Our work provides a powerful way to analyze genetic data in admixed populations and may contribute to the applicability of genomic medicine to admixed population groups.",

Using transcriptomic and enzymatic approaches, we characterized salivary glands and saliva of Phloeomyzus passerinii, an aphid exhibiting an atypical feeding strategy. Plant genes responses to salivary extracts of P. passerinii and Myzus persicae were assessed with poplar protoplasts of a susceptible and a resistant genotype, and in a heterologous Arabidopsis system. We predict that P. passerinii secretes a highly peculiar saliva containing effectors potentially interfering with host defenses, biotic stress signaling and plant metabolism, notably phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases which seemed specific to P. passerinii. Gene expression profiles indicated that salivary extracts of M. persicae markedly affected host defenses and biotic stress signaling, while salivary extracts of P. passerinii induced only weak responses. The effector-triggered susceptibility was characterized by downregulations of genes involved in cytokinin signaling and auxin homeostasis. This suggests that P. passerinii induces an intracellular accumulation of auxin in susceptible host genotypes, which is supported by histochemical assays in Arabidopsis. This might in turn affect biotic stress signaling and contribute to host tissue manipulation by the aphid.",

We test for association between the detected deletions and 275 protein levels in 1,457 individuals to assess the potential clinical impact of the detected CNVs. We describe the LD structure and copy number variation underlying the association between levels of the CCL3 protein and a complex structural variant (MAF = 0.15, p = 3.6x10-12) affecting CCL3L3, a paralog of the CCL3 gene.

Logistic regression modeling to become a case had an OR 6.2-12.6 (p<0.05) in presence of TT and ANDV well-known risk activities. Moreover, OR of 7.3 was obtained when TT condition was analyzed for two groups exposed to the same environmental risk.\\n\\nConclusionHost genetic background has an important role in ANDV-infection susceptibility in the studied population.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHantavirus is a worldwide infection known to cause two different diseases: the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS or HPS), diseases seen in the old world and new world hantaviruses, respectively. Andes orthohantavirus (ANDV), is the etiological agent of HCPS in Chile and South of Argentina, and is the only hantavirus recognized to be transmited person-to-person. It has been suggested that {beta}3-integrin is a cellular receptor for ANDV entry into cells. Here we try to understand the role of one human genetic variant of {beta}3-integrin in susceptibility to ANDV-infection. We compared, exposed infected and non infected subjects, and their genotype differences regarding a {beta}3 integrin variant that change a Leucine to Proline at PSI domain of the receptor. Leucine and proline aminoacids at the PSI domain, turn the cell susceptible or resistant to ANDV-infection, respectively. We were able to show genotype differences in cases and close-household contact that suggest differences in ANDV-infection susceptibility. Our results propose that the TT genotype, that codes to leucine, is a risk factor to become infected with ANDV, and the CC genotype that codes for proline at PSI domain, is a protective factor.

    "abstract": "The dried heartwood of Dalbergia odorifera is a very important traditional Chinese medicine. In nature, D. odorifera heartwood forms slowly over several decades, and excessive harvesting has caused large-scale reductions of its wild populations. To date, there have been no studies on artificial methods to induce heartwood formation in trees that have not already begun producing heartwood. We have published a patent for a whole-tree heartwood inducing technique for D. odorifera (the \\\"Dodor-Wit\\\" method); here, we describe and analyze its efficacy. Trees in four plantations in China were treated using this method. After two years, in 2016 and 2017, they were harvested and analyzed. Average heartwood yield per tree was 3,161.95 g. Heartwood induction rate (dry heartwood weight to total dry trunk weight after peeling) was 21.60%. Average volatile oil content per tree was 1.42%. Alcohol-soluble extract of the induced heartwood was 15.77%, exceeding the Chinese Pharmacopoeia standard. This is the first report on the Dodor-Wit method and heartwood induction in D. odorifera trees aged 5-8 years. The heartwood induced by Dodor-Wit satisfies the requirements of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. The Dodor-Wit method has an important role in solving the extreme scarcity of Chinese medicinal herbs.",

    "abstract": "Despite many calls to reform undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education to incorporate active learning into classes, there has been little attention paid to graduate level classrooms or courses taught by graduate students. Here, we set out to understand if and how STEM graduate students perceptions of active learning change in the classes they take versus those they teach by administering surveys to STEM graduate students at our institution. We found that graduate students had taken relatively few graduate level classes using active learning and they felt that more time should devoted to active learning in the courses they were taking. Teaching assistants felt that they were devoting the right amount of class time to active learning in the classes they taught. Graduate students also felt that they were using teaching methods in the classes they taught that were different from those they thought should be used when teaching undergraduates and were different from how they preferred to learn when taking classes. These findings suggest that graduate students perceptions of teaching and learning changed based on their role in the classroom, which have implications for graduate level course work and professional development programs.",

Most people recover within weeks to months after the injury, but a substantial proportion are at risk of developing lasting post-concussion symptoms. The Rivermead Post-Concussion Syndrome Questionnaire (RPQ) is a short validated 16-items self-report instrument to evaluate post-concussive symptoms. The aim of this study was to test psychometrics characteristics of the current Dutch translation of the RPQ.\\n\\nMethodsTo determine the psychometric characteristics of the Dutch RPQ, 472 consecutive patients six months after they presented with a traumatic brain injury in seven medical centers in the Netherlands (N=397), and in two in Belgium (Flanders) (N=75) took part in the study which is part of the large prospective longitudinal observational CENTER-TBI-EU-study. Psychometric properties at six months post TBI, were assessed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Sensitivity was analyzed by comparing RPQ scores of patients after mild vs. moderate and severe TBI.\\n\\nFindingsThe Dutch version of RPQ proved good, showing excellent psychometric characteristics: high internal consistency (Cronbachs  .93), and good construct validity, being sensitive to self-reported recovery status at six months post TBI. Moreover, data showed a good fit to the three dimensions structure of separate cognitive, emotional and somatic factors (Chi2=119; df=117; p=.4; CFI=.99; RMSEA=.006), reported earlier in the literature.\\n\\nDiscussionPsychometric characteristics of the Dutch version of RPQ proved excellent to good, and can the instrument therefore be applied for research purposes and in daily clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease, endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions, characterised by massive deformity and disability and can be fatal if untreated early and appropriately. Interleukins (IL)-35 and IL-37 are newly discovered cytokines that play an important role in suppressing the immune system. However, the expression of these interleukins in patients with Madurella mycetomatis (M. mycetomatis) induced eumycetoma has not yet been explored. This study aims to determine the levels of the IL-1 family (IL-1{beta}, IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in a group of these patients and the association between these cytokines levels and the patients demographic characteristics. The present, a case-control study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Soba University Hospital, University of Khartoum, Sudan and it included 140 individuals. They were divided into two groups; group I: healthy controls [n = 70; median age 25 years (range 12 to 70 years)]. Group II: mycetoma patients [n = 70 patients; median age 25 (range 13 to 70 years)]. Cytokines levels were measured in sera using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\\n\\nThere was no significant correlation between the IL-1{beta} and IL-12 levels and the lesions size and disease duration, whereas levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were significantly correlated with that. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma showed a significant negative association with IL-1{beta} cytokine, where a unit increment in IL-1{beta} will decrease the levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg/ml. The levels of IL-37 among the patients with a duration of mycetoma infection [&le;] one year had significantly decreased by an average of 18.45 compared to patients with a mycetoma infections duration of [&ge;] 5years (reference group). Furthermore, the risk factors of higher levels of IL-35 in mycetoma patients revealed a significant negative association with IL-12, as a unit increment in IL-12 decreases the levels of IL-35by 8.99 pg/ml (p < 0.001). Levels of IL-35 among the patients with duration of mycetoma infection [&le;] one year had significantly decreased (p-value = 0.002) on average by 41.82 compared to patients with a duration of mycetoma infection [&ge;] five years (reference group). In conclusion, this study indicates that both IL-35 and IL-37 are negatively associated with the levels of IL-1{beta} and IL-12 in eumycetoma mycetoma infection; and high levels of IL-37 and IL-35 may have a negative impact on disease progression.\\n\\nAuthors SummaryMycetoma is a progressive chronic granulomatous fungal or bacterial infection that may result in massive destruction of subcutaneous tissues, muscles and bones. Mycetoma is a neglected disease which is endemic in many tropical and subtropical areas. If the disease is not treated properly, eventually it ends up with amputation and adverse medical, health and socioeconomic effects on patients and the community.\\n\\nPrevious data suggested a crucial role of adaptive immunity in host resistance to causative agents and the disease progression. The recently identified IL-35 and IL-37 cytokines revealed an important role in immune suppression. Nevertheless, the expression of these interleukins in patients with mycetoma has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the present case-control study aimed to determine the levels of IL-1 family (IL-1{beta}, IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in these patients and the association between these cytokines levels and the patients demographic characteristics.\\n\\nThe results of this study showed that the levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were consistently positively correlated with different diameters of mycetoma lesions as well as its duration. However, the levels of IL-1{beta} and IL-12 were consistently negatively correlated with different diameters of lesions and the duration of mycetoma infection. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma showed a significant negative association with IL-1{beta} cytokine. Furthermore, the risk factors of higher levels of IL-35 in patients of mycetoma revealed a significant negative association with IL-12. These findings uncover a possible the role of IL-35 and IL-37 in the pathogenesis of mycetoma and may declare their potential value in the treatment of mycetoma.",

    "abstract": "The development of molecular syndrome-based kits for the diagnosis of respiratory infections offers rapid and sensitive detection of common respiratory pathogens and will have a significant impact on the care of patients. In this study, we present the results obtained after the introduction of the FilmArray respiratory panel in a field Point of care (POC) for the diagnosis of virus and bacteria responsible of respiratory tract infections in Senegal rural area. From February to August 2017, we collected nasal swabs from febrile patients that presented symptoms of respiratory tract infections in three health posts located in Niakhar. Specimens were tested on site by multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), using the FilmArray respiratory panel(R) that targets 20 pathogens, including 17 virus and 3 bacteria (bioMerieux). Nasal swabs were collected from 113 patients. The median age was 4 years (ranging from 4 months to 60 years) and 51 (45%) were males. The prevalence of respiratory pathogens was 37.5% (12/32) during the dry season and 54.3% (44/81) in the rainy season (p=0.16). The prevalence of respiratory pathogen carriage was higher in children under 5 years of age (38/55, 69.1%). The most prevalent micro-organisms detected were influenza B virus (16/113, 14%), human rhinovirus/enterovirus (10/113, 9%), parainfluenzae virus (9/113, 8%), respiratory syncytial virus (8/113, 7%), adenovirus (5/113, 4%), human metapneumovirus (3/113, 3%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (2/113, 2%) and Coronavirus (2/113, 2%). The study has demonstrated that the integration of the FilmArray respiratory panel into a field POC could significantly improve the management of respiratory tract infections in rural areas.\\n\\nAuthor summaryRespiratory tract infections are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Populations in underdeveloped countries are the most affected, especially children under 5 years of age. Among the pathogens responsible for these infections, bacteria and viruses are the most identified. In poor countries, laboratory diagnosis can only be done in urban areas. They are generally based on bacteriological, immunological or molecular biology techniques. The concept of POC is not developed in underdeveloped countries. Its existence would have made it possible to carry out RDTs to confirm the clinicians diagnosis and allow rapid management of the patient. In the current situation, the time required to achieve results is often very long for patients. In this study, we sought to demonstrate the significant contribution of the FilmArray respiratory panel in the management of respiratory tract infections in rural areas. We also wanted to reduce the time it takes to deliver results in order to improve patient care. This dispositif was integrated in a field POC which was implemented in Niakhar since 2015, in order to improve the management of emerging diseases. The FilmArray respiratory panel gave us the opportunity to investigate the causes of respiratory tract infections in this area. For each patient, we systematically target 20 pathogens, including 17 viruses and 3 bacteria, with a single multiplex PCR. One of the main results of this study is that children under 5 years of age are the most affected by respiratory tract infections. Then we noted a lack of consultation among adults that could be explained by the banalization of respiratory problems or a preference for traditional care. The fact that children under 5 years of age are the most affected could also serve as a basis for implementing vaccination programmes directly targeting the most vulnerable age groups. It should be noted that for 51% of patients, the result of the diagnosis was negative. It would appear that some pathogens responsible for respiratory tract infections are not targeted by the multiplex PCR. Thus, it would be necessary to screen these pathogens in order to integrate them into a panel that would cover the most pathogens in circulation in this area.",

In Drosophila maternal Makorin 1 (Mkrn1) has been linked to embryonic patterning and germ cell specification. Here, we show that Mkrn1 is required for translational activation of oskar, whose product is critical for axis specification and germ plasm assembly. We demonstrate that Mkrn1 interacts with poly(A) binding protein (pAbp) and binds osk 3 UTR in a region adjacent to A-rich sequences. This binding site also overlaps with Bruno (Bru) responsive elements (BREs), which regulate osk translation. We observe increased association of the translational repressor Bru with osk mRNA upon depletion of Mkrn1, implying that the two proteins compete for osk binding. Consistently, reducing Bru dosage partially rescues viability and Osk protein level in ovaries from Mkrn1 females. We conclude that Mkrn1 controls embryonic patterning and germ cell formation by specifically activating osk translation via displacing Bru from its 3 UTR.",

T-helper 1 cells are a major contributor to this disorder, but little is known about the role of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) in AA. Here, we analysed the distribution of circulating Treg subsets in twenty AA patients with active hair loss and fifteen healthy subjects by flow cytometry. The Treg suppressor HLA-DR+ subpopulation was significantly reduced in the patients (P<0.001) and there were significantly fewer cells expressing CD39 among the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg subpopulation in patients (P=0.001). FOXP3 CD39 Treg cells were also reduced in hair follicles; by 75% in non-lesional skin and 90% in lesional skin, when compared to control healthy skin. To further characterise Treg cells in AA; Tregs (CD4+CD25+FOXP3+) were investigated for their TCR{beta} sequence. PCR products analysed by Next Generation Sequencing techniques, showed that all frequent public clonotypes in AA Tregs were also present in controls at relatively similar frequencies, excepting two public clonotypes: CATSRDEGGLDEKLFF (V15 D1 J1-4) and CASRDGTGPSNYGYTF (V2 D1 J1-2), which were exclusively present in controls. This suggests that these Treg clonotypes may have a protective effect and that they may be an exciting subject for future therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the antibiotic susceptibility phenotype from genomic data is challenging, especially for some specific antibiotics in Enterobacteriaceae. Here we aimed to assess the performance of whole genomic sequencing (WGS) for predicting the antibiotic susceptibility in various Enterobacteriaceae species using the detection of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), specific mutations and a knowledge-based decision algorithm. We sequenced (Illumina MiSeq 2x250b) 187 clinical isolates from species possessing (n=98) or not (n=89) an intrinsic AmpC-type cephalosporinase. Antibiotic susceptibility was performed by the disc diffusion method. Reads were assembled by A5-miseq and ARGs were identified from the ResFinder database using Diamond. Mutations on GyrA and ParC topoisomerases were studied. We assessed the prediction rates for amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, meropenem, amikacin, gentamicin and fluoroquinolones. A total of 1,870 isolate/antibiotic combinations were considered. In 295 cases (15.8%) no attempt of prediction was made. Among the 1,575 attempts, 1,537 (97.6%) were correct (1,011 for predicting susceptibility and 526 for predicting resistance), 15 (0.9%) were major errors (MEs) and 23 (1.5%) were very major errors (VMEs). The concordance rates were similar between non-AmpC and AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae (907/935 [97.0%] vs 630/640 [98.4%], Chi2 test p=0.07), but more VMEs were observed in non-AmpC producing strains than in those producing an AmpC (20/935 [2.1%] vs 3/640 [0.5%], Chi2 test p=0.007). The majority of VMEs were putatively due to the overexpression of chromosomal genes. In conclusion, the inference of antibiotic susceptibility from genomic data showed good performances for non-AmpC and AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae species.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between economic conditions and environmental attitudes has been hotly debated in academic and public discourse. Some contend that economic prosperity strengthens environmental attitudes, while others argue that no such relationship exists. We shed light on the economy-environmental importance relationship by incorporating both nonlinear effects and public perceptions of the economy. Two countries with comparable economic performance and cultural heritage, Australia and Canada, are investigated. Using opinion survey data in a time-series analysis over a 20-year period, we find that GDP per capita has a nonlinear relationship with environmental attitudes in both countries, and the inclusion of perceptions of the economy significantly improves the prediction of environmental attitudes. In both Australia and Canada, a U-shaped relationship is observed; initial improvements in economic conditions tend to worsen environmental attitudes, but past a certain threshold, further economic improvements result in increased environmental concern. Perceptions of the economy too showed analogous trends. In both countries, positive perceptions of the economy were associated with strong environmental attitudes; at least in Canada, negative perceptions of the economy were also positively associated with environmental attitudes. The nonlinear effects of the economy as well as perceptions of the economy helps shed light on the current inconclusive literature on the relationship between the economy and citizens pro-environmental support. This is an important consideration given the critical importance to the future sustainability of the natural environment.",

    "abstract": "Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) are cationic leukocyte haloperoxidases with potent microbicidal and detoxifying activities. MPO selectively binds and kills specific Gram-positive bacteria (GPB) and all Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) tested. Endotoxin, i.e., lipopolysaccharide (LPS) comprising a toxic Lipid A component, is a characteristic of all GNB. The possibility that haloperoxidases bind to and inhibit the endotoxin of GBN was considered and tested by contacting MPO and EPO with LPS and Lipid A and measuring for inhibition of endotoxin activity using either the in vitro gel or chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assays. Contacting MPO and EPO with LPS purified from Escherichia coli O55:B5 and with diphosphoryl Lipid A purified from E. coli F583 inhibited their endotoxin activities in proportion to the natural log of the MPO or EPO concentration. Although MPO is less cationic than EPO, MPO consistently demonstrated inhibition of endotoxin activity that is about threefold superior to EPO. Haloperoxidase enzymatic activity was not required for inhibition, and MPO haloperoxidase action did not increase endotoxin inhibition. MPO and EPO inhibition of LPS endotoxin activity was also measured using a 90% lethal dose (LDO_SCPCAP90C_SCPCAP) mouse model studied over a five-day period. Based on Kaplan Meier survival analysis, MPO significantly increased mouse survival in a dose-dependent manner. EPO was less effective. In conclusion, contacting MPO and EPO with LPS and Lipid A inhibits in vitro endotoxin activities, but inhibition is independent of haloperoxidase enzymatic function. MPO significantly increases mouse survival against LPS in an in vivo LDO_SCPCAP90C_SCPCAP endotoxin model.",

    "abstract": "Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, and it plays an essential and important role in neural functions. Hypofunction of the glutamatergic pathway and the changes in the glutamate-glutamine cycle function are important neuropathological mechanisms of severe mental disorders including schizophrenia and depression. Current studies have shown that glutamate can induce neural biophotonic activity and transmission, which may involve the mechanism of photon quantum brain; however, it is unclear whether such a mechanism follows the principle of quantum mechanics. Here we show that the action of glutamate on its receptors leads to a decrease in its quantum energy levels, and glutamate then partially or completely loses its function to further induce the biophotonic activity in mouse brain slices. The reduced quantum energy levels of glutamate can be restored by direct-current electrical discharges and the use of energy transfer of chloroplast photosynthesis; hence, the quantum energy recovered glutamate can again induce significant biophotonic activity. Furthermore, the changes in quantum energy levels of glutamate are related to the exchange and transfer of electron energy on its active hydrogen atom. These findings suggest that the glutamate-induced neural biophotonic signals may be involved in the transfer of the quantum energy levels of glutamate, which implies a quantum mechanism of neurotransmitter action. The process of glutamate recycling that is related to the synergism of neurons and glial cells and certain key enzymes may be necessary for the recovery of quantum energy levels of glutamate after completion of the neural signal transmission. These findings may also provide a new idea to develop \\\"quantum drugs\\\".",

Phosphorylation converts eIF2 from a substrate into an inhibitor of eIF2B. We report cryoEM structures of eIF2 bound to eIF2B in the dephosphorylated state. The structures reveal that the eIF2B decamer is a static platform upon which one or two flexible eIF2 trimers bind and align with eIF2Bs bipartite catalytic centers to catalyze guanine nucleotide exchange. Phosphorylation refolds eIF2, allowing it to contact eIF2B at a different interface and, we surmise, thereby sequesters it into a non-productive complex.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryStructures of translation factors eIF2 and eIF2B reveal the mechanism of nucleotide exchange and its phosphoregulation during stress.",

Heteromorphic sex chromosomes can resolve this conflict and protect sexually antagonistic polymorphisms but accumulate deleterious mutations. However, many taxa lack differentiated sex chromosomes, and how sexual conflict is resolved in these species is largely unknown. Here we present a chromosome-anchored genome assembly for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and characterize a 56 Mb double-inversion supergene that mediates sex-specific migration through sex-dependent dominance, a mechanism that reduces sexual conflict. The double-inversion contains key photosensory, circadian rhythm, adiposity, and sexual differentiation genes and displays frequency clines associated with latitude and temperature, revealing environmental dependence. Our results constitute the first example of sex-dependent dominance across a large autosomal supergene, a novel mechanism for sexual conflict resolution capable of protecting polygenic sexually antagonistic variation while avoiding the homozygous lethality and deleterious mutation load of heteromorphic sex chromosomes.",

Calcium alone was compared to Aquamin, a multi-mineral natural product that contains magnesium and detectable levels of 72 additional trace elements in addition to calcium. Unlike the previously-studied tumor-derived colonoids (which remained un-differentiated in the absence of calcium-supplementation), normal tissue colonoids underwent differentiation as indicated by gross and microscopic appearance, a low proliferative index and high-level expression of cytokeratin 20 (CK20) in the absence of intervention. Only modest additional changes were seen in these parameters with either calcium alone or Aquamin (providing up to 3.0 mM calcium). In spite of this, proteomic analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed that both interventions induced strong up-regulation of proteins that promote cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesive functions, barrier formation and tissue integrity. Transmission electron microscopy revealed an increase in desmosomes in response to intervention. These findings demonstrate that histologically normal human colonoids can undergo differentiation in the presence of a low ambient calcium concentration. However, higher calcium levels can induce elaboration of proteins that promote cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. These changes could lead to improved barrier function and improved colon tissue health.",

    "abstract": "Intraneuronal accumulation of -synuclein (Syn) is key in the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease (PD). Published studies suggest that this process begins in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and propagates into the brain decades before clinical diagnosis of PD. The triggers and mechanisms underlying the accumulation of Syn remain unknown but evidence is growing, that immune pathways and in particular colitis may play a critical role. Here we demonstrate that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit Syn accumulation in their colon. We then confirmed in an experimental model of IBD that intestinal inflammation can trigger Syn accumulation in the ENS of wildtype and Syn transgenic mice. We discovered that the type and degree of inflammation modulates the extent of Syn accumulation in the colon and that macrophage-related signaling limits this process. Remarkably, experimental colitis at three months of age exacerbated the accumulation of aggregated phospho-Serine 129 Syn in the midbrain, including the substantia nigra, in 21-month but not 9-month-old Syn transgenic mice. This was accompanied by loss of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons, another neuropathological hallmark of PD. Together, our data suggest a critical role for intestinal inflammation in the initiation and progression of PD.",

    "abstract": "Active regulatory elements in eukaryotes are typically characterized by an open, nucleosome-depleted chromatin structure; mapping areas of open chromatin has accordingly emerged as a widely used tool in the arsenal of modern functional genomics. However, existing approaches for profiling chromatin accessibility are limited by their reliance on DNA fragmentation and short read sequencing, which leaves them unable to provide information about the state of chromatin on larger scales or reveal coordination between the chromatin state of individual distal regulatory elements. To address these limitations, we have developed a method for profiling accessibility of individual chromatin fibers at multi-kilobase length scale (SMAC-seq, or Single-Molecule long-read Accessible Chromatin mapping sequencing assay), enabling the simultaneous, high-resolution, single-molecule assessment of the chromatin state of distal genomic elements. Our strategy is based on combining the preferential methylation of open chromatin regions by DNA methyltransferases (CpG and GpC 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) enzymes) and the ability of long-read single-molecule nanopore sequencing to directly read out the methylation state of individual DNA bases. Applying SMAC-seq to the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that aggregate SMAC-seq signals match bulk-level accessibility measurements, observe single-molecule protection footprints of nucleosomes and transcription factors, and quantify the correlation between the chromatin states of distal genomic elements.",

Subjects accuracy increased with practice, even when tracking novel untrained paths. Using a \"searchlight\" paradigm, where only a short segment of the path ahead of the cursor was shown, we found that subjects with a higher tracking skill differed from the novice subjects in two respects. First, they had lower motor variability, in agreement with previous findings. Second, they took a longer section of the future path into account when performing the task, i.e. had a longer planning horizon. We estimate that between one third and one half of the performance increase was due to the increase in planning horizon. An optimal control model with a fixed horizon (receding horizon control) that increases with tracking skill quantitatively captured the subjects movement behaviour. These findings demonstrate that human subjects not only increase their motor acuity but also their planning horizon when acquiring a motor skill.\n\nNew and NoteworthyWe show that when learning a motor skill humans are using information about the environment from an increasingly longer amount of the movement path ahead to improve performance. Crucial features of the behavioural performance can be captured by modelling the behavioural data with a receding horizon optimal control model.",

Here we report the crystal structures of the chimeric fusion RI2:J-PKAc2 holoenzyme formed by J-PKAc and the PKA regulatory (R) subunit RI, and the wild type (wt) RI2:PKAc2 holoenzyme. The chimeric and wt RI holoenzymes have quaternary structures different from the previously solved wt RI{beta} and RII{beta} holoenzymes. The chimeric holoenzyme shows an isoform-specific interface dominated by antiparallel interactions between the N3A-N3A motifs of RI that serves as an anchor for RI structural rearrangements during cAMP activation. The wt RI holoenzyme showed the same configuration as well as a distinct second conformation. In the structure of the chimeric fusion RI2:J-PKAc2 holoenzyme, the presence of the J-domain does not prevent formation of the holoenzymes, and is positioned away from the symmetrical interface between the two RI:J-PKAc heterodimers in the holoenzyme. The J-domains have significantly higher temperature factors than the rest of the holoenzyme, implying a large degree of conformational flexibility. Furthermore molecular dynamics simulations were applied to analyze the conformational states of chimeric fusion and wt RI holoenzymes, and showed an ensemble of conformations in the majority of which the J-domain was dynamic and rotated away from the R:J-PKAc interface. Thus, rather than affecting the interactions with the regulatory subunits, the fusion of the J-domain to the PKAc alters the conformational landscape of the chimeric fusion holoenzymes and potentially, as result, the interactions with other molecules. The structural and dynamic features of these holoenzymes enhance our understanding of the fusion chimera protein J-PKAc that drives FLHCC as well as the isoform specificity of PKA.",

    "abstract": "Organ formation is an inherently biophysical process, requiring large-scale tissue deformations. Yet, understanding how complex organ shape emerges during development remains a major challenge. During fish embryogenesis, large muscle segments, called myotomes, acquire a characteristic chevron morphology, which is believed to play a role in swimming. The final myotome shape can be altered by perturbing muscle cell differentiation or by altering the interaction between myotomes and surrounding tissues during morphogenesis. To disentangle the mechanisms contributing to shape formation of the myotome, we combine single-cell resolution live imaging with quantitative image analysis and theoretical modeling. We find that, soon after its segmentation from the presomitic mesoderm, the future myotome spreads across the underlying tissues. The mechanical coupling between the myotome and the surrounding tissues is spatially varying, resulting in spatially heterogeneous friction. Using a vertex model, we show that the interplay of differential spreading and friction is sufficient to drive the initial phase of myotome shape formation. However, we find that active stresses, generated during muscle cell differentiation, are necessary to reach the acute angle of the myotome observed in wildtype embryos. A final ingredient for formation and maintenance of the chevron shape is tissue plasticity, which is mediated by orientated cellular rearrangements. Our work sheds a new light on how a spatio-temporal sequence of local cellular events can have a non-local and irreversible mechanical impact at the tissue scale, leading to robust organ shaping.",

Here we performed an unbiased EGFP insertional mutagenesis screen to probe for FXR2P domains important for assembly into higher order structural states in neurons. Fifteen of the 18 unique in-frame FXR2PEGFP fusions tested formed cytosolic granules. However, EGFP insertion within a 23 amino acid region of the low complexity (LC) domain induced formation of distinct FXR2PEGFP fibrils (A and B) that were found in isolation or assembled into highly ordered bundles. Type A and B complexes exhibited different developmental timelines, ultrastructure and ribosome association with ribosomes absent from bundled Type B fibrils. The formation of both fibril types was dependent on an intact RNA binding domain. We conclude that formation of these higher order FXR2P assemblages with alternative structural and compositional states in neurons requires collaboration between the LC and RNA binding domains.\\n\\nSummary StatementThe Fragile X protein FXR2P forms multiple types of fibrillar assemblages with differential ribosome associations in neurons through cooperation between its RNA binding and LC domains.",

    "abstract": "Prions are unusual protein assemblies that propagate their conformationally-encoded information in absence of nucleic acids. The first prion identified, the scrapie isoform (PrPSc) of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), is the only one known to cause epidemic and epizootic episodes(1). Most aggregates of other misfolding-prone proteins are amyloids, often arranged in a Parallel-In-Register-{beta}-Sheet (PIRIBS)(2) or {beta}-solenoid conformations(3). Similar folding models have also been proposed for PrPSc, although none of these have been confirmed experimentally. Recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray fiber-diffraction studies provided evidence that PrPSc is structured as a 4-rung {beta}-solenoid (4R{beta}S)(4, 5). Here, we combined different experimental data and computational techniques to build the first physically-plausible, atomic resolution model of mouse PrPSc, based on the 4R{beta}S architecture. The stability of this new PrPSc model, as assessed by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, was found to be comparable to that of the prion forming domain of Het-s, a naturally-occurring {beta}-solenoid. Importantly, the 4R{beta}S arrangement allowed the first simulation of the sequence of events underlying PrPC conversion into PrPSc. Our results provide the most updated, experimentally-driven and physically-coherent model of PrPSc, together with an unprecedented reconstruction of the mechanism underlying the self-catalytic propagation of prions.\\n\\nSignificanceSince the original hypothesis by Stanley Prusiner, prions have represented enigmatic agents diverging from the classical concept of genetic inheritance. However, the structure of PrPSc, the infectious isoform of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), has so far remained elusive, mostly due to technical challenges posed by its aggregation propensity. Here, we present a new high resolution model of PrPSc derived from the integration of a wide array of recent experimental constraints. By coupling the information of such model with a newly developed computational method, we reconstructed for the first time the conformational transition of PrPC to PrPSc. This study offers a unique workbench for designing therapeutics against prion diseases, and a physically-plausible mechanism explaining how protein conformation could self-propagate.",
