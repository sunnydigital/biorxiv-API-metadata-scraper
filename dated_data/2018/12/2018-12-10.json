    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles can be used to discern signatures that can identify specific genetic disorders. These methods are especially effective at identifying single gene (Mendelian) disease, and methods to identify such signatures have been built by comparing methylation profiles of known disease versus control samples. These methods, however, have to-date been supervised, precluding the application of these methods to diseases with as-yet-unknown genetic cause. In this work, we tackle the problem of unsupervised disease classification based on DNAm signatures. Our method combines pre-filtration of the data to identify most promising methylation sites, clustering to identify co-varying sites, and an iterative method to further refine the signatures to build an effective clustering framework. We validate the proposed method on four diseases with known DNAm signatures (CHARGE, Kabuki, Sotos, and Weaver syndromes) and show high accuracy at determining the correct disease using unsupervised analysis. We also experiment with our approach on a novel dataset of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Autism, and illustrate the de novo identification of a specific subtype.",

    "abstract": "Morphological changes during development, tissue repair, and disease largely rely on coordinated cell movements and are controlled by the tissue environment. Epithelial cell sheets are often subjected to large scale deformation during tissue formation. The active mechanical environment in which epithelial cells operate have the ability to promote collective oscillations, but how these cellular movements are generated and relate to collective migration remains unclear. Here, combining in vitro experiments and computational modelling we describe a novel mode of collective oscillations in confined epithelial tissues where the oscillatory motion is the dominant contribution to the cellular movements. We show that epithelial cells exhibit large-scale coherent oscillations when constrained within micro-patterns of varying shapes and sizes, and that their period and amplitude are set by the smallest confinement dimension. Using molecular perturbations, we then demonstrate that force transmission at cell-cell junctions and its coupling to cell polarity are pivotal for the generation of these collective movements. We find that the resulting tissue deformations are sufficient to trigger mechanotransduction within cells, potentially affecting a wide range of cellular processes.",

    "abstract": "Although tradeoffs are expected to play an essential role in shaping the diversity in a community, their effects remain relatively nebulous and notoriously difficult to assess. This is especially true when multiple tradeoffs occur simultaneously. When dealing with single tradeoffs some information can be predicted based on their curvature. Does the same happen when dealing with multiple tradeoffs? What happens if the tradeoffs have opposing curvatures? To address these issues, we develop a resource-based model that encompasses multiple tradeoffs mediated by the acquisition and processing of the resources. The model considers a spatially structured population of microbial organisms that can grow on an arbitrary number of resources, which come into the system at a constant rate and diffuse through the environment. The individuals can adopt a variety of strategies through mutation constrained by tradeoffs, which renders the model adaptive. We assess population sizes and levels of ecological specialization. We find that when multiple tradeoffs are considered the classical intuition developed for single tradeoffs does not hold. The outcome can depend significantly not only on the curvature of the tradeoffs but also on resource availability.",

    "abstract": "Mosquito-borne pathogens contribute significantly to the global burden of disease, infecting millions of people each year. Mosquito feeding is critical to the transmission dynamics of pathogens, and thus it is important to understanding and interpreting mosquito feeding patterns. In this paper we explore mosquito feeding patterns and their implications for disease ecology through a meta-analysis of published blood meal results collected across Australia from more than 12,000 blood meals from 22 species. To assess mosquito-vertebrate associations and identify mosquitoes on a spectrum of generalist or specialist feeders, we analysed blood meal data in two ways; first using a novel odds ratio analysis, and secondly by calculating Shannon diversity scores. We find that each mosquito species had a unique feeding association with different vertebrates, suggesting species-specific feeding patterns. Broadly, mosquito species could be grouped broadly into those that were primarily ornithophilic and those that fed more often on livestock. Aggregated feeding patterns observed across Australia were not explained by intrinsic variables such as mosquito genetics or larval habitats. We discuss the implications for disease transmission by vector mosquito species classified as generalist-feeders (such as Aedes vigilax and Culex annulirostris), or specialists (such as Aedes aegypti) in light of potential influences on mosquito host choice. Overall, we find that whilst existing blood meal studies in Australia are useful for investigating mosquito feeding patterns, standardisation of blood meal study methodologies and analyses, including the incorporation of vertebrate surveys, would improve predictions of the impact of vector-host interactions on disease ecology. Our analysis can also be used as a framework to explore mosquito-vertebrate associations, in which host availability data is unavailable, in other global systems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMales of the microscopic annelid family Dinophilidae use their prominent glandomuscular copulatory organ (penis) to enzymatically dissolve the females epidermis and thereafter inject sperm. In order to test for putative conserved copulatory structures and neural orchestration across three dinophilid species, we reconstructed the reproductive myo- and neuroanatomy and mapped neurotransmitter immunoreactivity patterns of two specific markers with reported roles in invertebrate male mating behaviour (FVRIamide, MIP) and three general neural markers (acetylated -tubulin, serotonin, FMRFamide).\\n\\nResultsSeminal vesicles (one or two pairs), surrounded by a thin layer of longitudinal and circular muscles and innervated by nerve fibres, are found between testes and copulatory organ in the larger males of Dinophilus vorticoides and Trilobodrilus axi, but are missing in the only 0.05 mm long D. gyrociliatus dwarf males. The midventral copulatory organ is in all species composed of an outer muscular penis sheath and an inner penis cone. Nerves encircle the organ equatorially, either as a ring-shaped circumpenial fibre mass or as dorsal and ventral commissures, which are connected to the ventrolateral nerve cords. All three examined dinophilids show similar serotonin-, FMRFamide-, and FVRIamide-like immunoreactivity patterns in the nerves surrounding the penis, supporting the general involvement of these neurotransmitters in copulatory behaviour in meiofaunal annelids. MIP-like immunoreactivity is restricted to the circumpenial fibre mass in D. gyrociliatus and commissures around the penis in T. axi (but not found in D. vorticoides), indicating its role in controlling the copulatory organ.\\n\\nConclusionsThe overall myo- and neuroanatomy of the reproductive organs is rather similar in the three studied species, suggesting a common ancestry of the unpaired glandomuscular copulatory organ and its innervation in Dinophilidae. This is furthermore supported by the similar immunoreactivity patterns of the tested neurotransmitters around the penis. Smaller differences in the immunoreactivity patterns around the seminal vesicles and spermioducts might account for additional, individual traits. We thus show morphological support for the putatively conserved role of FMRFamide, FVRIamide, MIP and serotonin in dinophilid copulatory behaviour.",

Comparative analysis of conserved miRNAs in mouse and human revealed stronger clustering of expression patterns by tissue types rather than by species. An analysis of messenger RNA gene expression clusters compared with miRNA expression clusters identifies the potential role of specific miRNA expression clusters in suppressing the expression of mRNAs specific to other developmental programs in the tissue where these microRNAs are expressed during embryonic development.

    "abstract": "Virus and host factors contribute to cell-to-cell variation in viral infections and determine the outcome of the overall infection. However, the extent of the variability at the single cell level and how it impacts virus-host interactions at a systems level are not well understood. To characterize the dynamics of viral transcription and host responses, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to quantify at multiple time points the host and viral transcriptomes of human A549 cells and primary bronchial epithelial cells infected with influenza A virus. We observed substantial variability of viral transcription between cells, including the accumulation of defective viral genomes (DVGs) that impact viral replication. We show a correlation between DVGs and viral-induced variation of the host transcriptional program and an association between differential induction of innate immune response genes and attenuated viral transcription in subpopulations of cells. These observations at the single cell level improve our understanding of the complex virus-host interplay during influenza infection.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEDefective influenza virus particles generated during viral replication carry incomplete viral genomes and can interfere with the replication of competent viruses. These defective genomes are thought to modulate disease severity and pathogenicity of the influenza infection. Different defective viral genomes also introduce another source of variation across a heterogeneous cell population. Evaluating the impact of defective virus genomes on host cell responses cannot be fully resolved at the population level, requiring single cell transcriptional profiling. Here we characterized virus and host transcriptomes in individual influenza-infected cells, including that of defective viruses that arise during influenza A virus infection. We established an association between defective virus transcription and host responses and validated interfering and immunostimulatory functions of identified dominant defective virus genome species in vitro. This study demonstrates the intricate effects of defective viral genomes on host transcriptional responses and highlights the importance of capturing host-virus interactions at the single-cell level.",

    "abstract": "Influenza B viruses cause respiratory disease epidemics in human populations and are included in seasonal influenza vaccines. Serological methods are employed to evaluate vaccine immunogenicity prior to licensure. However, the haemagglutination inhibition assay, which represents the gold standard for assessing the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines, has been shown to be relatively insensitive for the detection of antibodies against influenza B viruses. Furthermore, this assay, and the serial radial haemolysis assay are not able to detect stalk-directed cross-reactive antibodies. For these reasons there is a need to develop new assays that can overcome these limitations. The use of replication-defective viruses, such as lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with influenza A haemagglutinins, in microneutralization assays is a safe and sensitive alternative to study antibody responses elicited by natural infection or vaccination. We have produced Influenza B haemagglutinin-pseudotypes using plasmid-directed transfection. To activate influenza B haemagglutinin, we have explored the use of proteases by adding relevant encoding plasmids to the transfection mixture. When tested for their ability to transduce target cells, the newly produced influenza B pseudotypes exhibit tropism for different cell lines. Subsequently the pseudotypes were evaluated as surrogate antigens in microneutralization assays using reference sera, monoclonal antibodies, human sera collected during a vaccine immunogenicity study and surveillance sera from seals. The influenza B pseudotype virus neutralization assay was found to effectively detect neutralizing and cross-reactive responses despite lack of significant correlation with the haemagglutinin inhibition assay.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=61 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/492785_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (19K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d5d8e7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1934a06org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e0d0b8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a717e0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Here we applied fMRI while using chemogenetics to increase the excitation-to-inhibition ratio (E:I) within cortical microcircuits of the mouse brain, thereby mimicking a putative mechanism of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism. Increased E:I caused a significant reduction of long-range connectivity, irrespective of whether excitatory neurons were facilitated or inhibitory Parvalbumin interneurons were suppressed. Training a classifier on fMRI signals, we were able to accurately classify cortical areas exhibiting increased E:I. This classifier was validated in an independent cohort of Fmr1y/- knock-out mice, a model for autism with well-documented loss of Parvalbumin neurons and chronic alterations of E:I.

Here, we demonstrate the non-canonical unfoldase activity as an inherent functionality of the prokaryotic molecular chaperone Hsp33. The holding-inactive, reduced form of Hsp33 (RHsp33) strongly bound to the translational elongation factor, EF-Tu, and catalyzed the EF-Tu aggregation via evoking its aberrant folding, resulting in its susceptibility to proteolytic degradation by Lon. This interaction was critically mediated by the redox-switch domain of RHsp33 and the guanine nucleotide-binding domain of EF-Tu. The RHsp33-induced in vivo aggregation of EF-Tu upon heat shock was evident in a Lon-deficient strain and inhibited cell growth. Unlike wild-type Escherichia coli, the strain lacking both Hsp33 and Lon showed a non-reduced level of EF-Tu and diminished capability of counteracting heat shock. These findings suggest that the unique unfoldase/aggregase activity of Hsp33 potentially involved in protein turnover confers a cellular survival advantage under heat-stressed conditions.",

Contrary to non-cancerous cells, where BRCA2 deletion causes cell cycle arrest or cell death, BRCA2 inactivation in tumors is associated with uncontrolled cell proliferation. We set out to investigate this conundrum by exploring modalities of cell adaptation to loss of BRCA2 and focused on genome-wide transcriptome alterations. Human cells in which BRCA2 expression was inhibited using a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible shRNA for 4 or 28 days were subjected to RNA-seq analyses. Gene sets differentially expressed in BRCA2-deficient versus -proficient cells revealed a biphasic response to BRCA2 abrogation. The early, acute response consisted of downregulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression, DNA replication and repair and was associated with cell cycle arrest in G1. Surprisingly, the late, chronic response consisted predominantly of upregulation of innate immune response genes controlled by interferon. Activation of the cGAS-STING pathway detected in these cells further substantiated the concept that long-term BRCA2 abrogation triggers cell-intrinsic immune signaling. Importantly, we found that treatment with PARP inhibitors stimulated the interferon response in cells and tumors lacking BRCA2. We propose that PARP inhibitors may suppress growth of BRCA2-deficient cells and tumors, in part, by activating interferon signaling.",

    "abstract": "While intrinsic changes in aging hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are well-characterized, it remains unclear how hematopoietic niche affects HSC aging. Here, we demonstrate that cells in the niche -- endothelial cells (ECs) and CXCL12-abundant reticular cells (CARs) -- highly express the heme-degrading enzyme, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), but then decrease its expression with age. RNA-sequencing shows that ECs and CARs from HO-1-deficient animals (HO-1-/-) produce less hematopoietic factors. Consequently, HSCs from young HO-1-/- animals lose quiescence and regenerative potential. Young HO-1-/- HSCs exhibit features of premature aging on the transcriptional and functional level. HO-1+/+ HSCs transplanted into HO-1-/- recipients exhaust their regenerative potential early and do not reconstitute secondary recipients. In turn, transplantation of HO-1-/- HSCs to the HO-1+/+ recipients recovers the regenerative potential of HO-1-/- HSCs and reverses their transcriptional alterations. Thus, HSC-extrinsic activity of HO-1 prevents HSCs from premature aging and may restore the function of aged HSCs.",

    "abstract": "Calcineurin Inhibitors (CNI) are the pillars of immunosuppression in transplantation. However, they display a potent nephrotoxicity whose mechanisms remained widely unsolved. We used an untargeted quantitative proteomic approach (iTRAQ technology) to highlight new targets of CNI in renal proximal tubular cells (RPTCs). CNI-treated RPTCs proteome displayed an over-representation of Actin-binding proteins with a CNI-specific expression profile. Cyclosporine A (CsA) induced F-Actin remodelling and depolymerisation, decreased F-Actin-stabilizing, polymerization-promoting Cofilin (CFL) oligomers and inhibited the G-Actin-regulated serum responsive factor (SRF) pathway. Inhibition of CFL canonical phosphorylation pathway reproduced CsA effects; however, Ser3, an analogue of the phosphorylation site of CFL prevented the effects of CsA which suggests that CsA acted independently from the canonical CFL regulation. CFL is known to be regulated by the Na+/K+-ATPase. Molecular docking calculations evidenced 2 inhibiting sites of CsA on Na+/K+-ATPase and a 23% decrease in Na+/K+-ATPase activity of RPTCs was observed with CsA. Ouabain, a specific inhibitor of Na+/K+-ATPase also reproduced CsA effects on Actin organization and SRF activity. Altogether, these results described a new original pathway explaining CsA nephrotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "The many species of larkspur (Delphinium spp. L.) are among the most dangerous poisonous plants on rangelands in the western United States, causing death losses estimated at 2-5% (up to 15%) per year for cattle grazing in larkspur habitat. Other effects, such as altered grazing management practices and consequent lost forage quantity and quality, are significant but poorly understood. Current best management practice recommendations are based on seasonal avoidance, with little evidence that this is practical or effective. Our ongoing research has presented evidence that instead it may be possible to manage grazing such that all cattle eat some larkspur, but none eat a fatal dose. This raises the question of the potential response of larkspur to being grazed. In this study we examine the response of Geyers larkspur (D. geyeri Greene) to two seasons of 25% or 75% aboveground plant mass removal. The 75% treatment led to significantly lower alkaloid concentrations (mg*g-1) and pools (mg per plant), while the 25% treatment had a lesser effect. Combined with lessons from previous studies, this indicates that Geyers larkspur plants subject to aboveground mass removal such as may occur via grazing can be expected to become significantly less dangerous to cattle. We suggest that the mechanisms for this reduction are both alkaloid removal and reduced belowground root mass, as significant evidence indicates that alkaloids are synthesized and stored in the roots. These results continue to build support for our theory that the solution to the seemingly intractable challenge of larkspur poisoning lies not in avoidance but in the skill of managers and the wisdom of herds.",

Herein, we explored the physiological and gene expression responses of the clam hosts and their photosynthetically active symbionts over a 65-day experiment in which clams were exposed to either normal or environmentally relevant elevated seawater temperatures. These data were combined with publicly available data for both free-living Symbiodinium (clades C1 and F) and Symbiodinium spp. in hospite with the coral Pocillopora damicornis. Gene module preservation analysis revealed that the function of the symbionts photosystem II was impaired at high temperatures, and this response was conserved across all holobionts and Symbiodinium clades examined. Similarly, activation of the phytohormone abscisic acid signaling and epigenetics modulation appeared to be a key response mechanisms for symbionts in hospite with giant clams exposed to high temperatures and also distinguish thermo-tolerant from thermo-sensitive Symbiodinium C1 phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The regulated excretion of CO2 during breathing is a key life-preserving homeostatic mechanism. In the rostral medulla oblongata, neurons in two nuclei -the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) and the rostral medullary Raphe -have been proposed as central CO2 chemosensors that mediate adaptive changes in breathing. One such adaptive change is active expiration, thought to be controlled by the lateral parafacial region (pFL). Here we use promoter-driven expression of GCaMP6 and head-mounted mini-microscopes to image the Ca2+ activity in neurons and glia of RTN, Raphe and pFL in awake adult mice during inspiration of elevated CO2 to discriminate their roles in the adaptive response to hypercapnia. While there were multiple types of neuronal response to hypercapnia in both the RTN and the Raphe, a substantial proportion of neurons in the Raphe encoded the inspired level of CO2. By contrast, such responses were very rare in the RTN and the responses of RTN neurons suggest that this nucleus plays an integrative rather than a direct sensing role in the chemosensory reflex. pFL neurons were reliably activated by hypercapnia and their activity preceded active expiration suggesting a key causal link to this aspect of breathing. Our analysis considerably revises understanding of chemosensory control in the adult awake mouse and paves the way to understanding how breathing is coordinated with complex non-ventilatory behaviours such as swallowing and vocalisation.",

We used an audio-tactile integration task to measure the PPS boundary at different stages of pregnancy. We found that in the second trimester of pregnancy and postpartum women did not show differences in their PPS size as compared to the control group (non-pregnant women). However, in the third trimester the PPS was larger than the controls PPS and the shift between representation of near and far space was more gradual. We therefore conclude that during pregnancy the brain adapts to the sudden bodily changes, by expanding the representation of the space around the body. This may represent a mechanism to protect the vulnerable abdomen from injury from surrounding objects.",

    "abstract": "The erratic extent of aganglionic and hypoganglionic segments in Hirschsprungs disease (HD) makes it difficult to predict the amount of the intestine to remove in order to restore the proper functional motility. Our aim was to assess whether the embryonic rostro-caudal intestinal colonization by neuroblasts from the neural crest follows a predictable pattern in HD. In touch with Turings reaction diffusion model (RD), which describes biological patterns (such as leopard spots and lung branching morphogenesis) in terms of interactions/competitions between activating and inhibiting factors, we hypothesized that intestinal neural density could be triggered by local gut factors that counteract the proximal-distal embryonic progression of neural progenitors. While the neuronal number is approximately the same throughout the whole intestine in healthy subjects, in HD neural density decreases rostro-caudally towards the rectal region, due to an augmented activity and concentration of distal local inhibitors. In order to prove our hypothesis of HDs nervous rostro-caudal adjustments driven by Turing-like processes, we compared the neuronal density patterns achieved through RD models simulations with the neuronal numbers detected in different colonic regions from affected children. We showed that the virtual and the real plots display fully overlapping and matching features. The fact that neuronal decreases in impaired colons match Turing equationss previsions points towards the human intestine (both healthy and sick) as colonized through a diffusive proximal-distal neural pattern that is predictable, allowing us to straightforwardly calculate the length of the gut to resect during surgical procedures for HD.",

In African trypanosomes, hemoparasites of humans and animals, this is complicated by variant antigen repertoires containing hundreds of genes subject to various degrees of sequence recombination.\\n\\nFindingsWe introduce Variant Antigen Profiler (VAPPER), a tool that allows automated analysis of variant antigen repertoires of African trypanosomes. VAPPER produces variant antigen profiles for any isolate of the veterinary pathogens Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax from genomic and transcriptomic sequencing data and delivers publication-ready figures that show how the queried isolate compares with a database of existing strains. VAPPER is implemented in Python. It can be installed to a local Galaxy instance from the ToolShed (https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/) or locally on a Linux platform via the command line (https://github.com/PGB-LIV/VAPPER). The documentation, requirements, examples, and test data are provided in the Github repository.\\n\\nConclusionOur approach is the first to allow large-scale analysis of trypanosome variant antigens and establishes two different methodologies that may be applicable to other multi-copy gene families that are otherwise refractory to high-throughput analysis.",

We have proposed that the diffusible cue UNC-6(Netrin) is captured by UNC-40 (DCC) for a short-range interaction with UNC-5 to trigger self-avoidance in the C. elegans PVD neuron. Here we report that the actin-polymerizing proteins UNC-34(Ena/VASP), WSP-1(WASP), UNC-73(Trio), MIG-10(Lamellipodin) and the Arp2/3 complex effect dendrite retraction in the self-avoidance response mediated by UNC-6(Netrin). The paradoxical idea that actin polymerization results in shorter rather than longer dendrites is explained by our finding that NMY-1 (non-muscle myosin II) is necessary for retraction and could therefore mediate this effect in a contractile mechanism. Our results also show that dendrite length is determined by the antagonistic effects on the actin cytoskeleton of separate sets of effectors for retraction mediated by UNC-6(Netrin) versus outgrowth promoted by the DMA-1 receptor. Thus, our findings suggest that the dendrite length depends on an intrinsic mechanism that balances distinct modes of actin assembly for growth versus retraction.",

BF is also the most commonly isolated organism from clinical cases of intra-abdominal abscesses suggesting its potential to induce pro-inflammatory responses, upon accessing the systemic compartment. Hence, we examined the impact of mucosal and systemic exposures to BF on type 1 diabetes (T1D) incidence in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. The impact of intestinal exposure to BF under chemically-induced enhanced gut permeability condition, which permits microbial translocation, in T1D was also examined. While oral administration of pre-diabetic mice with heat-killed (HK) BF caused enhanced immune regulation and suppression of autoimmunity resulting in delayed hyperglycemia, mice that received HK BF by i.v. injection showed rapid disease progression. Importantly, polysaccharide-A deficient ({Delta}PSA) BF failed to produce these opposing effects upon oral and systemic deliveries. Further, BF induced modulation of disease progression was observed in WT, but not TLR2-deficient, NOD mice. Interestingly, oral administration of BF under enhanced gut permeability condition resulted in accelerated disease progression and rapid onset of hyperglycemia in NOD mice. Overall, these observations suggest that BF-like gut commensals can cause pro-inflammatory responses upon gaining access to systemic compartment and contribute to T1D in at-risk subjects.",

Here we demonstrate a method to limit inflammation and side effects associated with vaccination while retaining the protective responses using a variety of promising adjuvants. To accomplish this, we combined a selective NF-kB inhibitor with the immune adjuvant. The resulting vaccines reduce systemic inflammation and boost antibody responses. In an influenza challenge model, we demonstrate that this approach enhances protection. This method is generalizable across a broad range of adjuvants and antigens.

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) enables the unbiased detection of all potential pathogens in a clinical sample, including variants and even unknown pathogens. To apply mNGS in viral diagnostics, there is a need for sensitive and simultaneous detection of RNA and DNA viruses. In this study, the performance of an in-house mNGS protocol for routine diagnostics of viral respiratory infections, with single tube DNA and RNA sample-pre-treatment and potential for automated pan-pathogen detection was studied.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsThe sequencing protocol and bioinformatics analysis was designed and optimized including the optimal concentration of the spike-in internal controls equine arteritis virus (EAV) and phocine-herpes virus-1 (PhHV-1).The whole genome of PhHV-1 was sequenced and added to the NCBI database. Subsequently, the protocol was retrospectively validated using a selection of 25 respiratory samples with in total 29 positive and 346 negative PCR results, previously sent to the lab for routine diagnostics.\\n\\nResultsThe results demonstrated that our protocol using Illumina Nextseq 500 sequencing with 10 million reads showed high repeatability. The NCBI RefSeq database as opposed to the NCBI nucleotide database led to enhanced specificity of virus classification. A correlation was established between read counts and PCR cycle threshold value, demonstrating the semi-quantitative nature of viral detection by mNGS. The results as obtained by mNGS appeared condordant with PCR based diagnostics in 25 out of the 29 (86%) respiratory viruses positive by PCR and in 315 of 346 (91%) PCR-negative results. Viral pathogens only detected by mNGS, not present in the routine diagnostic workflow were influenza C, KI polyomavirus, and cytomegalovirus.\\n\\nConclusionsSensitivity and analytical specificity of this mNGS protocol was comparable with PCR and higher when considering off-PCR target viral pathogens. All potential viral pathogens were detected in one single test, while it simultaneously obtained detailed information on detected viruses.",

    "abstract": "In plants, cellulose is synthesized at the cell surface by plasma membrane (PM)-localized cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that underpin delivery of CSCs to the PM, however, are poorly understood. Cortical microtubules have been shown to interact with CESA-containing compartments and mark the site for CSC delivery, but are not required for the delivery itself. Here, we demonstrate that myosin XI and the actin cytoskeleton mediate CSC delivery to the PM by coordinating the exocytosis of CESA-containing compartments. Measurement of cellulose content indicated that cellulose biosynthesis was significantly reduced in a myosin xik xi1 xi2 triple knockout (xi3KO) mutant. By combining genetic and pharmacological disruption of myosin activity with quantitative live-cell imaging, we observed decreased abundance of PM-localized CSCs and reduced delivery rate of CSCs in myosin-deficient cells. These phenotypes correlated with a significant increase in failed vesicle secretion events at the PM as well as an abnormal accumulation of CESA-containing compartments at the cell cortex. Through high spatiotemporal assays of cortical vesicle behavior, we identified defects in CSC vesicle tethering and fusion at the PM. Furthermore, disruption of myosin activity reduced the delivery of several other secretory markers to the PM and reduced constitutive and receptor-mediated endocytosis. These findings reveal a previously undescribed role for myosin in vesicle secretion and cellulose production at the cytoskeleton-PM-cell wall nexus.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology is transforming therapeutic paradigms by engineering living cells and microbes to intelligently sense and respond to diseases including inflammation1,2, infections3-5, metabolic disorders6,7, and cancer8,9. However, the ability to rapidly engineer new therapies far outpaces the throughput of animal-based testing regimes, creating a major bottleneck for clinical translation10,11. In vitro approaches to address this challenge have been limited in scalability and broad-applicability. Here, we present a bacteria-in-spheroid co-culture (BSCC) platform that simultaneously tests host species, therapeutic payloads and synthetic gene circuits of engineered bacteria within multicellular spheroids over a timescale of weeks. Long-term monitoring of bacterial dynamics and disease progression enables quantitative comparison of critical therapeutic parameters such as efficacy and biocontainment. Specifically, we screen S. typhimurium strains expressing and delivering a library of antitumor therapeutic molecules via several synthetic gene circuits. We identify novel candidates exhibiting significant tumor reduction and demonstrate high similarity in their efficacies using a syngeneic mouse model. Lastly, we show that our platform can be expanded to dynamically profile diverse microbial species including L. monocytogenes, P. mirabilis, and E. coli in various host cell types. This high-throughput framework may serve to accelerate synthetic biology for clinical applications and understanding the host-microbe interactions in disease sites.",

    "abstract": "Global change will compromise the population sizes, species ranges, and survival of economically-important plants and animals, including crops, aquaculture species, and foundational ecosystem builders. Scleractinian reef-building corals are a particular concern because they are slow-growing, long-lived, environmentally-sensitive, and concentrated in the warmest regions of the ocean. Assisted Gene Flow (AGF) is considered a viable tool to help natural plant and animal populations, including corals, adapt to changing environments. Our goal was to test for the first time whether cryopreserved coral sperm could be used to facilitate assisted gene flow between genetically-isolated populations of a Caribbean coral. We collected, pooled, and cryopreserved coral sperm from the threatened Caribbean coral Acropora palmata in the western Caribbean (Key Largo, FL), central Caribbean (Rincon, Puerto Rico), and eastern Caribbean (Curacao). Alongside freshly-collected sperm from Curacao, the cryopreserved sperm from each of these populations was used for in vitro fertilization experiments with freshly-collected eggs from Curacao. Across five egg donors, average fertilization success was 91 to 99% for CUR x CUR (fresh sperm) crosses, 37 to 82% for CUR x CUR (frozen sperm) crosses, 3 to 19% for CUR x FL (frozen sperm) crosses and 0 to 24% for CUR x PR (frozen sperm) crosses. Notably, fertilization was achieved in all four categories of crosses, showing for the first time through direct evidence that populations of A. palmata are reproductively compatible, and that genetic diversity can be transferred from one population to another for the purposes of assisted gene flow. The resulting larvae were reared in Curacao for up to 7 days, then the swimming larvae were transported to Florida for settlement and grow-out at two separate facilities, which achieved larval settlement rates of 37 to 60% across all cohorts. Larvae were reared and settled in Florida to acclimate them to the ambient water quality, microbial environment, and temperature regimes of the western genetic A. palmata population as early in their life cycle as possible. At one month, over 54% all settlers had survived, including over 3500 settlers from CUR x CUR (frozen sperm), 1200 settlers from CUR x FL (frozen sperm), and 230 settlers from CUR x PR (frozen sperm). These experiments represent the first-ever pan-Caribbean coral crosses produced in captivity and the first direct evidence that geographically-separated and genetically-isolated populations of any Caribbean coral are reproductively compatible. Moreover, with over 4700 A. palmata settlers produced using cryopreserved sperm, this represents the largest living wildlife population ever created from cryopreserved material. Together, these findings demonstrate that cryopreservation of coral sperm can enable efficient, large-scale assisted gene flow in corals. This form of assisted migration can not only help to preserve the population-level genetic diversity of extant coral populations but also help to increase population resilience to global change.",

Therefore, knowledge of microenvironmental nutrient levels is essential to understand tumor metabolism. To measure the extracellular nutrient levels available to tumors, we developed a quantitative metabolomics method to measure the absolute concentrations of >118 metabolites in plasma and tumor interstitial fluid, the extracellular fluid that perfuses tumors. Comparison of nutrient levels in tumor interstitial fluid and plasma revealed that the nutrients available to tumors differ from those present in circulation. Further, by comparing interstitial fluid nutrient levels between autochthonous and transplant models of murine pancreatic and lung adenocarcinoma, we found that tumor type, anatomical location and animal diet affect local nutrient availability.

    "abstract": "Many neuropsychiatric risk genes contribute to epigenetic regulation of gene expression but very little is known about specific chromatin-associated mechanisms governing the formation and maintenance of neuronal connectivity. Here we show that transcallosal connectivity is critically dependent on C11orf46 (also known as ARL14EP), a small nuclear protein encoded in the chromosome 11p13 Wilms Tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary Abnormalities, intellectual disability (formerly referred to as Mental Retardation) (WAGR) risk locus. C11orf46 haploinsufficiency in WAGR microdeletion cases was associated with severe hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. In utero short hairpin RNA-mediated C11orf46 knockdown disrupted transcallosal projections of cortical pyramidal neurons, a phenotype that was rescued by wild type C11orf46 but not the C11orf46R236H mutant associated with autosomal recessive intellectual disability. Multiple genes encoding key regulators of axonal growth and differentiation, including Sema6A, were hyperexpressed in C11orf46-knockdown neurons. Importantly, RNA-guided epigenetic editing of neuronal Sema6a gene promoters via a dCas9 protein-conjugated SunTag scaffold with multimeric (10x) C11orf46 binding during early developmental periods, resulted in normalization of expression and rescue of transcallosal dysconnectivity via repressive chromatin remodeling, including up-regulated histone H3K9 methylation by the KAP1-SETDB1 repressor complex. Our study demonstrates that interhemispheric communication is highly sensitive to locus-specific remodeling of neuronal chromatin, revealing the therapeutic potential for shaping the brains connectome via gene-targeted designer activators and repressor proteins.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is central to the adaptation and evolution of bacteria. However, our knowledge about the flow of genetic material within complex microbiomes is lacking; most studies of HGT rely on bioinformatic analyses of genetic elements maintained on evolutionary timescales or experimental measurements of phenotypically trackable markers (e.g. antibiotic resistance). Consequently, our knowledge of the capacity and dynamics of HGT in complex communities is limited. Here, we utilize the CRISPR-Cas spacer acquisition process to detect HGT events from complex microbiota in real-time and at nucleotide resolution. In this system, a recording strain is exposed to a microbial sample, spacers are acquired from foreign transferred elements and permanently stored in genomic CRISPR arrays. Subsequently, sequencing and analysis of these spacers enables identification of the transferred elements. This approach allowed us to quantify transfer frequencies of individual mobile elements without the need for phenotypic markers or post-transfer replication. We show that HGT in human clinical fecal samples can be extensive and rapid, often involving multiple different plasmid types, with the IncX type being the most actively transferred. Importantly, the vast majority of transferred elements did not carry readily selectable phenotypic markers, highlighting the utility of our approach to reveal previously hidden real-time dynamics of mobile gene pools within complex microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, has reservoirs in fresh and brackish water where it interacts with virulent bacteriophages. Phages are the most abundant biological entity on earth and co-evolve with bacteria. It was reported that concentrations of phage and V. cholerae inversely correlate in aquatic reservoirs and in the human small intestine, and therefore that phages may quench cholera outbreaks. Although there is strong evidence for phage predation in cholera patients, evidence is lacking for phage predation of V. cholerae in aquatic environments. Here, we used three virulent phages, ICP1, ICP2, and ICP3, commonly shed by cholera patients in Bangladesh, as models to understand the predation dynamics in microcosms simulating aquatic environments. None of the phages were capable of predation in fresh water, and only ICP1 was able to prey on V. cholerae in estuarine water due to a requirement for salt. We conclude that ICP2 and ICP3 are better adapted for predation in a nutrient rich environment. Our results point to the evolution of niche-specific predation by V. cholerae-specific virulent phages, which complicates their use in predicting or monitoring cholera outbreaks as well as their potential use in reducing aquatic reservoirs of V. cholerae in endemic areas.\\n\\nSignificance statementVirulent phages can reduce populations of bacteria and help shape bacterial evolution. Here, we used three virulent phages to understand their equilibrium with V. cholerae in nutrient-limiting aquatic microcosms. It has been proposed that phages quench cholera outbreaks, but no direct evidence of phage predation in aquatic environments had been established. Here we show that different phages possess varied abilities to infect in certain niches or stages of the host bacterial life cycle. Unveiling the phage/bacterial interactions in their natural setting is important to the understanding of cholera outbreaks and could be ultimately used to help develop a method for outbreak prediction and/or control.",

We targeted the high-affinity protein-protein interface of CaV{beta}s pocket within the CaV-subunit. Structure-based virtual screening of 50,000 small molecule library docked to the {beta}-subunit led to the identification of 2-(3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)-N-((4-((3-phenylpropyl)amino)quinazolin-2-yl)methyl)acetamide (compound 45).

    "abstract": "Since the dietary supplement and prebiotic value of {beta}-glucan-rich products have been widely recognized and the dietary approaches for modulating autoimmunity have been increasingly explored, we assessed the impact of oral administration of high-pure yeast {beta}-glucan (YBG) on gut immune function, microbiota and type 1 diabetes (T1D) using mouse models. Oral administration of this non-digestible complex polysaccharide caused a Dectin-1-dependent immune response involving increased expression of IL10, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (Raldh) and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the gut mucosa. YBG-exposed intestinal DCs induced/expanded primarily Foxp3+, IL10+ and IL17+ T cells, ex vivo. Importantly, prolonged oral administration of low-dose YBG at pre-diabetic stage suppressed insulitis and significantly delayed the T1D incidence in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Further, prolonged treatment with YBG showed increased Foxp3+ T cell frequencies, and a significant change in the gut microbiota, particularly an increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes and a decrease in the Firmicute members. Oral administration of YBG, together with Raldh-substrate and {beta}-cell antigen, resulted in a better protection of NOD mice from T1D. These observations suggest that YBG not only has a prebiotic property, but also has an oral tolerogenic-adjuvant-like effect, and these features could be exploited for modulating autoimmunity in T1D.",

    "abstract": "Sensory stimuli have extensive correlations, which should be exploited by an efficient detector of specific sensory features according to theoretical principles. Here we show that visual stimulation far outside the classical receptive field center causes ganglion cells to subsequently increase their sensitivity to local stimuli in a process we term long-range sensitization. This increased sensitivity improves detection and discrimination of weak stimuli and exhibits pattern specificity, increasing sensitivity more when peripheral and central stimuli share spatial frequency statistics. This process requires input from wide-field, nonlinear inhibitory amacrine cells, supporting a simple circuit model that reproduces sensitization. We further show that long-range sensitization parallels a novel perceptual effect in humans, in which surround stimulation subsequently improves discrimination of a small central stimulus. We conclude that the retina uses long-range statistics of the visual world to better encode local visual features, and that such improved encoding may play a role in perception.",

    "abstract": "The present study describes the ipsilateral and contralateral cortico-cortical and corticothalamic connectivity of the temporal visual areas 20a and 20b in the ferret using standard anatomical tract-tracing methods. The two temporal visual areas are strongly interconnected, but area 20a is primarily connected to the occipital visual areas, whereas area 20b maintains more widespread connections with the occipital, parietal and suprasylvian visual areas and the secondary auditory cortex. The callosal connectivity, although homotopic, consists mainly of very weak anterograde labelling which was more widespread in area 20a than area 20b. Although areas 20a and 20b are well connected with the visual dorsal thalamus, the injection into area 20a resulted in more anterograde label, whereas more retrograde label was observed in the visual thalamus following the injection into area 20b. Most interestingly, comparisons to previous connectional studies of cat areas 20a and 20b reveal a common pattern of connectivity of the temporal visual cortex in carnivores, where the posterior parietal cortex and the central temporal region (PMLS) provide network points required for dorsal and ventral stream interaction enroute to integration in the prefrontal cortex. This pattern of network connectivity is not dissimilar to that observed in primates, which highlights the ferret as a useful animal model to understand visual sensory integration between the dorsal and ventral streams. This data will contribute to the Ferretome (www.ferretome.org) to facilitate cross species analysis of brain connectomes and wiring principles of the brain.",

    "abstract": "We investigated afferent inputs from all areas in the frontal cortex (FC) to different subregions in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). Using retrograde tracing in macaque monkeys, we quantified projection strength by counting retrogradely labeled cells in each FC area. The projection from different FC regions varied across injection sites in strength, following different spatial patterns. Importantly, a site at the rostral end of the cingulate sulcus stood out as having strong inputs from many areas in diverse FC regions. Moreover, it was at the integrative conjunction of three projection trends across sites. This site marks a connectional hub inside the rACC that integrates FC inputs across functional modalities. Tractography with monkey diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) located a similar hub region comparable to the tracing result. Applying the same tractography method to human dMRI data, we demonstrated that a similar hub can be located in the human rACC.",

Their simple combination usually does not provide an improvement if compared with using the best source alone. In this paper, we proposed a framework based on a recent multiple kernel learning algorithm called EasyMKL and we investigated the benefits of this approach for diagnosing two different mental health diseases. The well known Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset tackling the Alzheimer Disease (AD) patients versus healthy controls classification task, and a second dataset tackling the task of classifying an heterogeneous group of depressed patients versus healthy controls. We used EasyMKL to combine a huge amount of basic kernels alongside a feature selection methodology, pursuing an optimal and sparse solution to facilitate interpretability. Our results show that the proposed approach, called EasyMKLFS, outperforms baselines (e.g. SVM and SimpleMKL), state-of-the-art random forests (RF) and feature selection (FS) methods.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe development of collateral vasculature is a key mechanism compensating for arterial occlusions in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). We aimed to examine the development of collateral pathways after ligation of native vessels in a porcine model of PAD.\n\nMethodsRight hindlimb Ischemia was induced in domestic swine (N=11, male, kg) using two different versions of arterial ligation. Version 1 (N=6) consisted of ligation/division of the right external iliac, profunda femoral (RPFA) and superficial femoral arteries (RSFA). Version 2 (N=5) consisted of the ligation of Version 1 with additional ligation/division of the right internal iliac artery (RIIA). Development of collateral pathways was evaluated with standard angiography at baseline (prior to arterial ligation) and at termination (4-8 weeks later). Relative luminal diameter of the arteries supplying the ischemic right hindlimb were determined by 2D angiography, as percent of the size of the distal aortic diameter.\n\nResultsThe dominant collateral pathway that developed after version 1 ligation connected the RIIA to the RPFA and RSFA/popliteal artery. Mean luminal diameter ({+/-} standard error) of the RIIA at termination increased by 38% (P<0.05) compared to baseline. Two co-dominant collateral pathways developed in version: (i) from the common internal iliac trunk and left internal iliac artery to the reconstituted RIIA, which then supplied the RPFA and RSFA/popliteal arteries; and (ii) from left profunda artery to the reconstituted RPFA. Mean diameter of the common internal iliac trunk and left profunda artery both increased at termination in the range of 20% (p < 0.05).\n\nConclusionTwo versions of hindlimb ischemia induction (right ilio-femoral artery ligation with and without right internal iliac artery ligation in swine produced differing collateral pathways, along with changes to the diameter of the inflow vessels (i.e., arteriogenesis). Radiographic and anatomical data of the collateral formation in this porcine model should have value in investigation of the pathophysiology of hindlimb ischemia, and assessment of angiogenic therapies as potential treatments for PAD.",

    "abstract": "Under nutrient-rich conditions, stochasticity of transcription drives protein expression noise. However, by shifting the environment to amino acid-limited conditions, we identified in E. coli a source of noise whose strength is dictated by translational processes. Specifically, we discovered that cell-to-cell variations in fluorescent protein expression depend on codon choice, with codons yielding lower mean expression after amino acid downshift also resulting in greater noise. We propose that ultra-sensitivity in the tRNA charging/discharging cycle shapes the strength of the observed noise by amplifying fluctuations in global intracellular parameters, such as the concentrations of amino acid, synthetase, and tRNA. We hypothesize that this codon-dependent noise may allow bacteria to selectively optimize cell-to-cell variability in poor environments without relying on low molecular numbers.",

    "abstract": "The gene mutated in Huntingtons disease (HD) patients encodes the 348 kDa huntingtin (HTT) protein. The pathogenic HD CAG-expansion mutation causes a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract at the N-terminus of the HTT protein to expand above a critical threshold of ~35 glutamine residues. The effect of HD mutations on HTT is not well understood, in part due to difficulties in carrying out biochemical, biophysical and structural studies of this large protein. To facilitate such studies, we have generated expression constructs for the scalable production of HTT in multiple eukaryotic expression systems. Our set of HTT expression clones comprises both N and C-terminally FLAG-tagged HTT constructs with polyQ lengths representative of the general population, HD patients, juvenile HD patients as well as the more extreme polyQ expansions used in some HD tissue and animal models. These reagents yield milligram quantities of pure recombinant HTT protein, including many of the previously mapped posttranslational modifications. We have characterised both apo and HTT-HAP40 complex samples produced using this HD resource, demonstrating that this toolkit can be used to generate physiologically meaningful complexes of HTT. We demonstrate how these resources can produce sufficient material for protein-intensive experiments such as small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), providing biochemical insight into HTT protein structure. The work outlined in this manuscript and the tools generated, lay a foundation for further biochemical and structural work on the HTT protein and its functional interactions with other biomolecules.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to identify design criteria for the development of an assistive powered hand exoskeleton by consulting with potential end users. Structured interviews with clinicians and patients with hand impairment were carried out and the results were tabulated. Three participants with impaired hand function also underwent a quantitative measurement session regarding hand function. The objective of the measurement sessions was to understand the characteristics, abilities and limitations of the upper limb of individuals who could benefit from a hand exoskeleton device, in order to better define design criteria and control options for such a device. For the most part, clinicians and participants with hand impairment agreed on expectations for a hand exoskeleton device on topics including important grasp patterns, wear time, and grip strength. However, their expectation seemed to diverge on the topic of control, where clinicians felt simple reliable control strategies would be preferred, but patients desired intuitive control. This research has identified key features of hand exoskeleton design requirements that will need to be met in order to have acceptable clinical translation to patient populations. Including endusers in the design of such a device is essential for successful patient-oriented technology development.",

Substantial effort has been devoted to modeling and adjusting for compositional differences when estimating differential expression between sample types. However, relatively little attention has been given to the effect of tissue composition on co-expression estimates. In this study, we illustrate the effect of variable cell type composition on correlation-based network estimation and provide a mathematical decomposition of the tissue-level correlation. We show that a class of deconvolution methods developed to separate tumor and stromal signatures can be applied to two component cell type mixtures. In simulated and real data, we identify conditions in which a deconvolution approach would be beneficial. Our results suggest that uncorrelated cell type specific markers are ideally suited to deconvolute both the expression and co-expression patterns of an individual cell type. Finally, we provide a Shiny application for users to interactively explore the effect of cell type composition on correlation-based co-expression estimation for any cell types of interest.",

The two divisions of posterior parietal cortex of the ferret are strongly interconnected, however area PPc shows stronger connectivity with the occipital and suprasylvian visual cortex, while area PPr shows stronger connectivity with the somatomotor cortex, reflecting the functional specificity of these two areas. This pattern of connectivity is mirrored in the contralateral callosal connections. In addition, PPc and PPr are connected with the visual and somatomotor nuclei of the dorsal thalamus. Numerous connectional similarities exist between the posterior parietal cortex of the ferret (PPc and PPr) and the cat (area 7 and 5), indicative of the homology of these areas within the Carnivora. These findings highlight the existence of a fronto-parietal network as a shared feature of the organization of parietal cortex across Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatherians, with the degree of expression varying in relation to the expansion and areal complexity of the posterior parietal cortex. This observation indicates that the ferret is a potentially valuable experimental model animal for understanding the evolution and function of the posterior parietal cortex and the fronto-parietal network across mammals.

Decoding specific movement features, such as speed and force, may provide additional useful information at the expense of increasing the complexity of the decoding problem. Recent attempts to predict movement speed and force from the electroencephalogram (EEG) achieved classification accuracy levels not better than chance, stressing the demand for more accurate prediction strategies. Thus, the aim of this study was to improve the prediction accuracy of hand movement speed and force from single-trial EEG signals recorded from healthy volunteers. A strategy based on convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) was tested, since it has previously shown good performance in the classification of EEG signals. ConvNets achieved an overall accuracy of 84% in the classification of two different levels of speed and force (4-class classification) from single-trial EEG. These results represent a substantial improvement over previously reported results, suggesting that hand movement speed and force can be accurately predicted from single-trial EEG.",
