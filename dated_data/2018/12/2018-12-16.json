    "abstract": "Procedural learning is a fundamental cognitive function that facilitates efficient processing of and automatic responses to complex environmental stimuli. Here, we examined training-dependent and off-line changes of two sub-processes of procedural learning: namely, sequence learning and statistical learning. Whereas sequence learning requires the acquisition of order-based relationships between the elements of a sequence, statistical learning is based on the acquisition of probabilistic associations between elements. Seventy-eight healthy young adults (58 females and 20 males) completed the modified version of the Alternating Serial Reaction Time task that was designed to measure Sequence and Statistical Learning simultaneously. After training, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: active wakefulness, quiet rest, or daytime sleep. We examined off-line changes in Sequence and Statistical Learning as well as further improvements after extended practice. Performance in Sequence Learning increased during training, while Statistical Learning plateaued relatively rapidly. After the off-line period, both the acquired sequence and statistical knowledge was preserved, irrespective of the vigilance state (awake, quiet rest or sleep). Sequence Learning further improved during extended practice, while Statistical Learning did not. Moreover, within the sleep group, cortical oscillations and sleep spindle parameters showed differential associations with Sequence and Statistical Learning. Our findings can contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic changes of multiple parallel learning and consolidation processes that occur during procedural memory formation.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsThe main challenge in analysing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from extended samples of subject (N>100) is to extract as much relevant information as possible from big amounts of noisy data. When studying neurodegenerative diseases with resting-state fMRI, one of the objectives is to determine regions with abnormal background activity with respect to a healthy brain and this is often attained with comparative statistical models applied to single voxels or brain parcels within one or several functional networks. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on clustering and stochastic rank aggregation to identify parcels that exhibit a coherent behaviour in groups of subjects affected by the same disorder and apply it to default-mode network independent component maps from resting-state fMRI data sets.\\n\\nMethodsBrain voxels are partitioned into parcels through k-means clustering, then solutions are enhanced by means of consensus techniques. For each subject, clusters are ranked according to their median value and a stochastic rank aggregation method, TopKLists, is applied to combine the individual rankings within each class of subjects. For comparison, the same approach was tested on an anatomical parcellation.\\n\\nResultsWe found parcels for which the rankings were different among control subjects and subjects affected by Parkinsons disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and found evidence in literature for the relevance of top ranked regions in default-mode brain activity.\\n\\nConclusionsThe proposed framework represents a valid method for the identification of functional neuromarkers from resting-state fMRI data, and it might therefore constitute a step forward in the development of fully automated data-driven techniques to support early diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cells perceive their microenvironment through chemical and physical cues. However, how mechanical signals are interpreted during embryonic tissue deformation resulting in specific cell behaviors is largely unexplored. The Yap/Taz family of transcriptional co-activators has emerged as an important regulator of tissue growth and regeneration, responding to physical cues from the extracellular matrix, cell shape and actomyosin cytoskeleton. In this work, we unveiled the role of Yap/Taz-TEAD activity as sensor of mechanical signals in the regulation of the progenitor behavior of boundary cells during hindbrain compartmentalization. Monitoring in vivo Yap/Taz-activity during hindbrain segmentation we discovered that boundary cells respond to mechanical cues in a cell-autonomous manner through Yap/Taz-TEAD activity. Cell-lineage analysis revealed that Yap/Taz-TEAD boundary cells decrease their proliferative activity when Yap/Taz-TEAD ceased, preceding changes of cell fate: from proliferating progenitors to differentiated neurons. Functional experiments demonstrated the pivotal role of Yap/Taz-TEAD signaling in maintaining the progenitor features in the hindbrain boundary cell population.",

    "abstract": "As a result of ocean warming, the species composition of the Arctic seas has begun to shift in a boreal direction. One ecosystem prone to fauna shifts is the Northeast Greenland shelf. The dispersal route taken by boreal fauna to this area is, however, not known. This knowledge is essential to predict to what extent boreal biota will colonise Arctic habitats. Using population genetics, we show that Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella), and deep-sea shrimp (Pandalus borealis) specimens recently found on the Northeast Greenland shelf originate from the Barents Sea, and suggest that pelagic offspring were dispersed via advection across the Fram Strait. Our results indicate that boreal invasions of Arctic habitats can be driven by advection, and that the fauna of the Barents Sea can project into adjacent habitats with the potential to colonise putatively isolated Arctic ecosystems such as Northeast Greenland.",

    "abstract": "The oculomotor system integrates a variety of visual signals into appropriate motor plans, but such integration can have widely varying time scales. For example, smooth pursuit eye movements to follow a moving target are slower and longer-lasting than saccadic eye movements, and it has been suggested that initiating a smooth pursuit eye movement involves an obligatory open-loop interval, in which new visual motion signals presumably cannot influence the ensuing motor plan for up to 100 ms after movement initiation. However, this view runs directly contrary to the idea that the oculomotor periphery has privileged access to short-latency visual signals. Here we show that smooth pursuit initiation is sensitive to visual inputs, even in \\\"open-loop\\\" intervals. We instructed male rhesus macaque monkeys to initiate saccade-free smooth pursuit eye movements, and we injected a transient, instantaneous eye position error signal at different times relative to movement initiation. We found robust short-latency modulations in eye velocity and acceleration, starting only [~]50 ms after transient signal occurrence, and even during \\\"open-loop\\\" pursuit initiation. Critically, the spatial direction of the injected position error signal had predictable effects on smooth pursuit initiation, with forward errors increasing eye acceleration and backwards errors reducing it. Catch-up saccade frequencies and amplitudes were also similarly altered [~]50 ms after transient signals, much like well-known effects on microsaccades during fixation. Our results demonstrate that smooth pursuit initiation is highly sensitive to visual signals, and that catch-up saccade generation is reset after a visual transient.",

    "abstract": "Humans and vocal animals use vocalizations (human speech or animal  calls) to communicate with members of their species. A necessary function of auditory perception is to generalize across the high variability inherent in the production of these sounds and classify them into perceptually distinct categories ( words or  call types). Here, we demonstrate using an information-theoretic approach that production-invariant classification of calls can be achieved by detecting mid-level acoustic features. Starting from randomly chosen marmoset call features, we used a greedy search algorithm to determine the most informative and least redundant set of features necessary for call classification. Call classification at >95% accuracy could be accomplished using only 10 - 20 features per call type. Most importantly, predictions of the tuning properties of putative neurons selective for such features accurately matched some previously observed responses of superficial layer neurons in primary auditory cortex. Such a feature-based approach succeeded in categorizing calls of other species such as guinea pigs and macaque monkeys, and could also solve other complex classification tasks such as caller identification. Our results suggest that high-level neural representations of sounds are based on task-dependent features optimized for specific computational goals.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary biologists have long sought to understand the full complexity in pattern and process that shapes organismal diversity. Although phylogenetic comparative methods are often used to reconstruct complex evolutionary dynamics, they are typically limited to a single phenotypic trait. Extensions that accommodate multiple traits lack the ability to partition multidimensional datasets into a set of mosaic suites of evolutionarily linked characters. I introduce a comparative framework that identifies heterogeneity in evolutionary patterns across large datasets of continuous traits. Using a model of continuous trait evolution based on the differential accumulation of disparity across lineages in a phylogeny, the approach algorithmically partitions traits into a set of character suites that best explains the data, where each suite displays a distinct pattern in phylogenetic morphological disparity. When applied to empirical data, the approach revealed a mosaic pattern predicted by developmental biology. The evolutionary distinctiveness of individual suites can be investigated in more detail, either by fitting conventional comparative models or by directly studying the phylogenetic patterns in disparity recovered during the analysis. This framework can supplement existing comparative approaches by inferring the complex, integrated patterns that shape evolution across the body plan from disparate developmental, morphometric, and environmental sources of phenotypic data.",

    "abstract": "Although well known for its role in apoptosis, the executioner caspase DrICE has a non-apoptotic function that is required for elongation of the epithelial tubes of the Drosophila tracheal system. Here, we show that DrICE acts downstream of the Hippo Network to regulate endocytic trafficking of at least four cell polarity, cell junction and apical extracellular matrix proteins involved in tracheal tube size control: Crumbs, Uninflatable, Kune-Kune and Serpentine. We further show that tracheal cells are competent to undergo apoptosis, even though developmentally-regulated DrICE function rarely kills tracheal cells. Our results reveal a novel developmental role for caspases, a previously unidentified pool of DrICE that colocalizes with Clathrin, and a mechanism by which the Hippo Network controls endocytic trafficking. Given published reports of in vitro regulation of endocytosis by mammalian caspases during apoptosis, we propose that caspase-mediated regulation of endocytic trafficking is an evolutionarily conserved function of caspases that can be deployed during morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Recent outbreaks of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in China severely influenced the swine industry of the country. Currently, there is no effective vaccine or drugs against ASFVs. How to effectively control the virus is challenging. In this study, we have analyzed all the publicly available ASFV genomes and demonstrated that there was a large genetic diversity of ASFV genomes. Interestingly, the genetic diversity was mainly caused by extensive genomic insertions and/or deletions (indels) instead of the point mutations. The genomic diversity of the virus resulted in proteome diversity. Over 250 types of proteins were inferred from the ASFV genomes, among which only 144 were observed in all analyzed viruses. Further analyses showed that the homologous recombination may contribute much to the indels, as supported by significant associations between the occurrence of extensive recombination events and the indels in the ASFV genomes. Repeated elements of dozens of nucleotides in length were observed to widely distribute and cluster in the adjacent positions of ASFV genomes, which may facilitate the occurrence of homologous recombination. Moreover, two enzymes, which were possibly related to the homologous recombination, i.e., a Lambda-like exonuclease with a YqaJ-like viral recombinase domain, and a DNA topoisomerase II, were found to be conservative in all the analyzed ASFVs. This work highlighted the importance of the homologous recombination in the evolution of the ASFVs, and helped with the strategy development of the prevention and control of the virus.",

While resistance via active site mutations in the viral NS3/4A protease has been well characterized, the mechanism for resistance of non-active site mutations is unclear. R155K and V36M often co-evolve and while R155K alters the electrostatic network at the binding site, V36M is more than 13 [A] away. In this study the mechanism by which V36M confers resistance, in the context of R155K, is elucidated with drug susceptibility assays, crystal structures, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for three protease inhibitors: telaprevir, boceprevir and danoprevir. The R155K and R155K/V36M crystal structures differ in the -2 helix and E2 strand near the active site, with alternative conformations at M36 and side chains of active site residues D168 and R123, revealing an allosteric coupling, which persists dynamically in MD simulations, between the distal mutation and the active site. This allosteric modulation validates the network hypothesis and elucidates how distal mutations confer resistance through propagation of conformational changes to the active site.",

We solved cocrystal structures of SOCS2-ElonginB-ElonginC in complex with phosphorylated peptides from substrates growth hormone receptor (GHR-pY595) and erythropoietin receptor (EpoR-pY426) at 1.98 A{square} and 2.69 A{square}, respectively. Both peptides bind in an extended conformation recapitulating the canonical SH2 domain-pY pose, yet capture different conformations of the EF loop via specific hydrophobic interactions. The flexible BG loop, for the first time fully defined in the electron density, does not contact the substrate degrons directly. Cancer-associated SNPs located around the pY pocket weaken substrate-binding affinity in biophysical assays. Our findings reveal insights into substrate recognition and specificity by SOCS2, and provide a blueprint for small molecule ligand design.",

While head direction cells can be found throughout the brain, spatial tuning outside the hippocampal formation are often non-specific or conjunctive to other representations such as a reward. Although the precise mechanism of spatially selective activities is not understood, various studies show sensory inputs (particularly vision) heavily modulate spatial representation in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit. To better understand the contribution from other sensory inputs in shaping spatial representation in the brain, we recorded from the primary somatosensory cortex in foraging rats. To our surprise, we were able to identify the full complement of spatial activity patterns reported in the hippocampal-entorhinal network, namely, place cells, head direction cells, boundary vector/border cells, grid cells and conjunctive cells. These newly identified somatosensory spatial cell types form a spatial map outside the hippocampal formation and support the hypothesis that location information is necessary for body representation in the somatosensory cortex, and may be analogous to spatially tuned representations in the motor cortex relating to the movement of body parts. Our findings are transformative in our understanding of how spatial information is used and utilized in the brain, as well as functional operations of the somatosensory cortex in the context of rehabilitation with brain-machine interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Multicellular life processes such as proliferation and differentiation depend on cell surface signaling receptors that bind ligands generally referred to as growth factors. Recently, it has emerged that the endosomal system provides rich signal processing capabilities for responses elicited by these factors [1-3]. At the single cell level, endosomal trafficking becomes a critical component of signal processing, as exemplified by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors of the receptor tyrosine kinase family. EGFRs, once activated by EGF, are robustly trafficked to the phosphatase-enriched peri-nuclear region (PNR), where they are dephosphorylated [4-8]. However, the details of the mechanisms regulating the movements of stimulated EGFR in time and space, i.e., towards the PNR, are not known. What endosomal regulators provide specificity to EGFR? Do modifications to the receptor upon stimulation regulate its trafficking? To understand the events leading to EGFR translocation, and especially the early endosomal dynamics that immediately follow EGFR internalization, requires the real-time, long-term, whole-cell imaging of multiple elements. Here, exploiting the advantages of lattice light-sheet microscopy [9], we show that the binding of EGF by its receptor, EGFR, triggers a transient calcium increase that peaks by 30 s, causing the desorption of APPL1 from pre-existing endosomes within one minute, the rebinding of liberated APPL1 to EGFR within three minutes, and the dynein-dependent translocation of APPL1-EGF-bearing endosomes to the PNR within five minutes. The novel, cell spanning, fast acting network that we reveal integrates a cascade of events dedicated to the cohort movement of activated EGFR receptors. Our findings support the intriguing proposal that certain endosomal pathways have shed some of the stochastic strategies of traditional trafficking, and have evolved behaviors whose predictability is better suited to signaling [10, 11]. Work presented here demonstrates that our whole cell imaging approach can be a powerful tool in revealing critical transient interactions in key cellular processes such as receptor trafficking.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe welding process releases potentially hazardous gases and fumes, mainly composed of metallic oxides, fluorides and silicates. Long term welding fume (WF) inhalation is a recognized health issue that carries a risk of developing chronic health problems, particularly respiratory system diseases (RSDs). Aside from general airway irritation, WFs may drive direct cellular responses in the respiratory system which increase risk of RSD, but these are not well understood.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed a quantitative framework to identify gene expression effects of WFs that may affect RSD development. We analyzed gene expression microarray data from WF-exposed tissues and RSD-affected tissues, including chronic bronchitis (CB), asthma (AS), pulmonary edema (PE), lung cancer (LC) datasets. We built disease-gene (disea-some) association networks and identified dysregulated signaling and ontological pathways, and protein-protein interaction sub-network using neighborhood-based benchmarking and multilayer network topology.\\n\\nResultsWe observed many genes with altered expression in WF-exposed tissues were also among differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in RSD tissues; for CB, AS, PE and LC there were 34, 27, 50 and 26 genes respectively. DEGs analysis, with disease association networks, pathways, ontological analysis and protein-protein interaction sub-network suggest significant links between WF exposure and the development of CB, AS, PE and LC.\\n\\nConclusionsOur network-based analysis and investigation of the genetic links of WFs and RSDs confirm a number of genes and gene products are plausible participants in RSD development. Our results are a significant resource to identify causal influences on the development of RSDs, particularly in the context of WF exposure.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian genomes are folded into Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), consisting of cell-type specific chromatin loops anchored by CTCF and cohesin. Since CTCF and cohesin are expressed ubiquitously, how cell-type specific CTCF-mediated loops are formed poses a paradox. Here we show RNase-sensitive CTCF self-association in vitro and that an RNA-binding region (RBR) mediates CTCF clustering in vivo. Intriguingly, deleting the RBR abolishes or impairs almost half of all chromatin loops in mouse embryonic stem cells. Disrupted loop formation correlates with abrogated clustering and diminished chromatin binding of the RBR mutant CTCF protein, which in turn results in a failure to halt cohesin-mediated extrusion. Thus, CTCF loops fall into at least 2 classes: RBR-independent and RBR-dependent loops. We suggest that evidence for distinct classes of RBR-dependent loops may provide a mechanism for establishing cell-specific CTCF loops regulated by RNAs and other RBR partner.",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, lipoproteins are important components of the cell envelope and are responsible for many essential cellular functions. They are produced by the post-translational covalent attachment of lipids that occurs via a sequential 3-step process controlled by three essential integral membrane enzymes. The last step of this process, unique to Gram negative bacteria, is the N-acylation of the terminal cysteine by Apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase (Lnt) to form the final mature lipoprotein. Here we report 2 crystal forms of this enzyme. In one form the enzyme crystallized with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. In one of those molecules the thioester acyl-intermediate is observed. In the other molecule, the crystal packing suggests one potential mode of apolipoprotein docking to Lnt. In the second crystal form the enzyme crystallized with one molecule in the asymmetric unit in an apparent apo-state remarkably devoid of any bound molecules in the large open substrate entry portal. Taken together, these structures suggest that the movement of the essential W237 is triggered by substrate binding and could help direct and stabilize the interaction between Lnt and the incoming substrate apolipoprotein.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=142 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/497412v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (55K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@318596org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@139463corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13213ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ba011b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "NAD+ administration can produce profound beneficial effects in the animal models of aging and a number of diseases. Since oxidative stress plays key pathological roles in aging and multiple major disorders, it is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of NAD+ administration on oxidative stress-induced cell death. Previous studies have suggested that NAD+ treatment can decrease oxidative cell death indirectly by such mechanisms as preventing mitochondrial permeability transition, while it is unclear if NAD+ administration may decrease oxidative cell death by increasing directly the antioxidant capacity of the cells. Our current study used rotenone-treated differentiated PC12 cells as a cellular model to test our hypothesis that NAD+ treatment may increase directly the antioxidant capacity of the cells exposed to oxidative stress. Our study has indicated that NAD+ treatment can significantly attenuate the rotenone-induced increase in oxidative stress in the cells. Moreover, NAD+ treatment can significantly enhance the GSH/GSSG ratio - a major index of antioxidant capacity - of rotenone-treated cells. Collectively, our study has provided the first evidence indicating that NAD+ treatment can increase directly the antioxidant capacity of cells exposed to oxidative stress. These findings have suggested a novel mechanism underlying the profound protective effects of NAD+ administration in numerous disease models: NAD+ administration can decrease oxidative stress-induced cell death by enhancing directly the antioxidant capacity of the cells. Our finding has also highlighted the nutritional potential of NAD+.",

This enabled us to assess changes in anxiety-related and social behaviours, and neural alterations potentially underlying such changes, driven specifically by A{beta} accumulation. AppNL-G-F knock-in mice exhibited subtle deficits in tasks assessing social memory, but not in social motivation tasks. In anxiety-assessing tasks, AppNL-G-F knock-in mice exhibited: 1) increased thigmotaxis in the Open Field (OF), yet; 2) reduced closed-arm, and increased open-arm, time in the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM). Their ostensibly-anxiogenic OF profile, yet ostensibly-anxiolytic EPM profile, could hint at altered cortical mechanisms affecting decision-making (e.g.  disinhibition), rather than simple core deficits in emotional motivation. Consistent with this possibility, alterations in microstructure, glutamatergic-dependent gamma oscillations, and glutamatergic gene expression were all observed in the prefrontal cortex, but not the amygdala, of AppNL-G-F knock-in mice. Thus, insoluble A{beta} overexpression drives prefrontal cortical alterations, potentially underlying changes in social and anxiety-related behavioural tasks.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIAppNL-G-F KI mice displayed differing anxiety behaviours in two tests of anxiety.\\nC_LIO_LIPrefrontal gamma was no longer NMDA-receptor dependent in AppNL-G-F KI mice.\\nC_LIO_LIPrefrontal expression of Grin2b was reduced in AppNL-G-F KI mice.\\nC_LIO_LIDTI found structural alterations in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in AppNL-G-F KI mice.\\nC_LI",

Cryst., (2014), 47, 1190) we derived the Martini beads form factors for nucleic acids and we implemented them, together with those previously determined for proteins, in the publicly available PLUMED library. We also implemented a hybrid multi-resolution strategy to perform SAXS restrained simulations at atomic resolution by calculating on-the-fly the virtual position of the Martini beads and using them for the calculation of SAXS. The accuracy and efficiency of the method is demonstrated by refining the structure of two protein/nucleic acid complexes. Instrumental for this result is the use of metainference that allows considering and alleviating the approximations at play in our SAXS calculation.",

We use large data sets to obtain a thermodynamic measure of the protein-protein interaction network, namely the associated Gibbs free energy. We find a reasonably strong inverse correlation between the percentage of energy production via oxidative phosphorylation and the Gibbs free energy of the protein networks. The latter is a measure of functional dysregulation within the cell. Our findings corroborate earlier indications that signaling pathway upregulation in cancer cells are linked to the metabolic shift known as the Warburg effect, hence these two seemingly independent characteristics of cancer phenotype may be interconnected.",

Non-clustered {delta}1 protocadherins form a cadherin subgroup of proteins with seven extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats and cytoplasmic domains distinct from those of classical cadherins. The non-clustered {delta}1 protocadherins mediate homophilic adhesion and have been implicated in various diseases including asthma, autism, and cancer. Here we present X-ray crystal structures of Protocadherin-1 (PCDH1), a {delta}1-protocadherin member essential for New World hantavirus infection that is typically expressed in the brain, airway epithelium, skin keratinocytes, and lungs. The structures suggest a binding mode that involves antiparallel overlap of repeats EC1 to EC4. Mutagenesis combined with binding assays and biochemical experiments validated this mode of adhesion. Overall, these results reveal the molecular mechanism underlying adhesiveness of PCDH1 and {delta}1-protocadherins, also shedding light on PCDH1s role in maintaining airway epithelial integrity, the loss of which causes respiratory diseases.",

We studied SC migratory behavior ex vivo and in vivo after exogenous transplantation in the demyelinated spinal cord. Data highlight for the first time that SC migrate preferentially along blood vessel in perivascular ECM, avoiding CNS myelin. We demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that this migration route occurs by virtue of a dual mode of action of Eph/ephrin receptor. Indeed, EphrinB3, enriched in myelin, interacts with SC Eph receptors, to drive SC away from CNS myelin, and triggers their preferential adhesion to ECM components, such as fibronectin via integrin{beta}1 interactions. This complex interplay enhances SC migration along the blood vessel network and together with lesion-induced vascular remodeling facilitates their timely invasion of the lesion site. These novel findings elucidate the mechanism by which SC invade and contribute to spinal cord repair.",

    "abstract": "To date, the majority of authors on scientific publications have been men. While much of this gender bias can be explained by historic sexism and discrimination, there is concern that women may still be disadvantaged by the peer review process if reviewers unconscious biases lead them to reject publications with female authors more often. One potential solution to this perceived gender bias in the reviewing process is for journals to adopt double-blind reviews whereby neither the authors nor the reviewers are aware of each others identities and genders. To test the efficacy of double-blind reviews, we assigned gender to every authorship of every paper published in 5 different journals with different peer review processes (double-blind vs. single blind) and subject matter (birds vs. behavioral ecology) from 2010-2018 (n = 4865 papers). While female authorships comprised only 35% of the total, the double-blind journal Behavioral Ecology did not have more female authorships than its single-blind counterparts. Interestingly, the incidence of female authorship is higher at behavioral ecology journals (Behavioral Ecology and Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology) than in the ornithology journals (Auk, Condor, Ibis), for papers on all topics as well as those on birds. These analyses suggest that double-blind review does not currently increase the incidence of female authorship in the journals studied here. We conclude, at least for these journals, that double-blind review does not benefit female authors and may, in the long run, be detrimental.",

    "abstract": "--Most applications of flow cytometry or cell sorting rely on the conjugation of fluorescent dyes to specific biomarkers. However, labeled biomarkers are not always available, they can be costly, and they may disrupt natural cell behavior. Label-free quantification based upon machine learning approaches could help correct these issues, but label replacement strategies can be very difficult to discover when applied labels or other modifications in measurements inadvertently modify intrinsic cell properties. Here we demonstrate a new, but simple approach based upon feature selection and linear regression analyses to integrate statistical information collected from both labeled and unlabeled cell populations and to identify models for accurate label-free single-cell quantification. We verify the methods accuracy to predict lipid content in algal cells (Picochlorum soloecismus) during a nitrogen starvation and lipid accumulation time course. Our general approach is expected to improve label-free single-cell analysis for other organisms or pathways, where biomarkers are inconvenient, expensive, or disruptive to downstream cellular processes.",

    "abstract": "{beta}-adrenergic receptor ({beta}-AR) signaling, by acting directly on tumor cells and angiogenesis, has been showed to exert pro-tumoral effects. Growing evidence also suggests that {beta}-AR expressed by immune cells affect the associated anti-tumor immune response. However, how and where {beta}-AR signaling impinges the anti-tumor immune response is still unclear. Using a mouse model of vaccine-based immunotherapy, we show here that propranolol, a non-selective {beta}-blocker, strongly improved the efficacy of the vaccine by enhancing the frequency of CD8+ T lymphocytes infiltrating the tumor (TILs). However, propranolol had no obvious effect on the reactivity of CD8+ TILs, a result further strengthened by ex-vivo experiments showing that these cells are insensitive to AR signaling triggered by adrenaline or noradrenaline. In contrast, we show that naive CD8+ T cell activation was strongly inhibited by {beta}-AR signaling and that the beneficial effect of propranolol mainly occurred during their initial priming phase. We also demonstrate that the differential sensitivity of CD8+ TILs and naive CD8+ T cells is related to their activation status since in vitro-activated CD8+ T cells behaved similarly to CD8+ TILs, both exhibiting a down-regulation of the {beta}2-AR expression. These results reveal that the initial priming phase of the anti-tumor response in the tumor-draining lymph node is a decisive part of the suppressive effect of {beta}-AR signaling on the CD8+ T-cell response against cancer. These findings provide a rationale for the strategic use of clinically available {beta}-blockers in patients to improve cancer immunotherapies such as anti-cancer vaccination strategies.",

    "abstract": "Ion channel proteins control ionic flux across biological membranes through conformational changes in their transmembrane pores. An exponentially increasing number of channel structures captured in different conformational states are now being determined. However, these newly-resolved structures are commonly classified as either open or closed based solely on the physical dimensions of their pore and it is now known that more accurate annotation of their conductive state requires an additional assessment of the effect of pore hydrophobicity. A narrow hydrophobic gate region may disfavour liquid-phase water, leading to local de-wetting which will form an energetic barrier to water and ion permeation without steric occlusion of the pore. Here we quantify the combined influence of radius and hydrophobicity on pore de-wetting by applying molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning to nearly 200 ion channel structures. This allows us to propose a simple simulation-free heuristic model that rapidly and accurately predicts the presence of hydrophobic gates. This not only enables the functional annotation of new channel structures as soon as they are determined, but may also facilitate the design of novel nanopores controlled by hydrophobic gates.\n\nSignificance statementIon channels are nanoscale protein pores in cell membranes. An exponentially increasing number of structures for channels means that computational methods for predicting their functional state are needed. Hydrophobic gates in ion channels result in local de-wetting of pores which functionally closes them to water and ion permeation. We use simulations of water behaviour within nearly 200 different ion channel structures to explore how the radius and hydrophobicity of pores determine their hydration vs. de-wetting behaviour. Machine learning-assisted analysis of these simulations enables us to propose a simple model for this relationship. This allows us to present an easy method for the rapid prediction of the functional state of new channel structures as they emerge.",

For example, sister chromatids of the X and Y chromosomes segregate non-randomly during asymmetric division of male germline stem cells (GSCs) in D. melanogaster. Here we identify that the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci, which are located on the X and Y chromosomes, and an rDNA-binding protein, Indra, are required for non-random sister chromatid segregation (NRSS). We provide the evidence that NRSS is a mechanism by which GSCs recover rDNA copy number, which occurs through unequal sister chromatid exchange, counteracting the spontaneous copy number loss that occurs during aging. Our study reveals an unexpected role for NRSS in maintaining germline immortality through maintenance of a vulnerable genomic element, rDNA.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryrDNA copy number maintenance by non-random sister chromatid segregation contributes to germline immortality in Drosophila",

    "abstract": "Atomic-resolution structure determination is the key requirement for understanding protein function. Cryo-EM and NMR spectroscopy both provide structural information, but currently cryo-EM does not routinely give access to atomic-level structural data, and, generally, NMR structure determination is restricted to small (<30 kDa) proteins. We introduce an integrated structure determination approach that simultaneously uses NMR and EM data to overcome the limits of each of these methods. The approach enabled determination of the high-resolution structure of the 468 kDa large dodecameric aminopeptidase TET2 to a precision and accuracy below 1 [A] by combining secondary-structure information obtained from near-complete magic-angle-spinning NMR assignments of the 39 kDa-large subunits, distance restraints from backbone amides and specifically labelled methyl groups, and a 4.1 [A] resolution EM map. The resulting structure exceeds current standards of NMR and EM structure determination in terms of molecular weight and precision. Importantly, the approach is successful even in cases where only medium-resolution (up to 8 [A]) cryo-EM data are available, thus paving avenues for the structure determination of challenging biological assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen that can cause infections that range from superficial skin and mucosal infections to life threatening disseminated infections. S. aureus can attach to medical devices and host tissues and form biofilms that allow the bacteria to evade the host immune system and provide protection from antimicrobial agents. To counter host-generated oxidative and nitrosative stress mechanisms that are part of the normal host responses to invading pathogens, S. aureus utilizes low molecular weight (LMW) thiols, such as bacillithiol (BSH). Additionally, S. aureus synthesizes its own nitric oxide (NO), which combined with its downstream metabolites may also protect the bacteria against specific host responses. We have previously shown that LMW thiols are required for biofilm formation in Mycobacterium smegmatis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our data show that the bshC mutant, which is defective in the last step of the bacillithiol pathway and lacks BSH, is impaired in biofilm formation. We also identify a putative S-nitrosobacillithiol reductase (BSNOR), similar to a S-nitrosomycothiol reductase found in M. smegmatis, and show that the BSNOR mutant has reduced levels of BSH and decreased biofilm formation. Our studies also show that NO plays an important role in biofilm formation and that acidified sodium nitrite severely reduces biofilm thickness. These studies provide insight into the roles of oxidative and nitrosative stress mechanisms on biofilm formation and indicate that bacillithiol and nitric oxide are key players in normal biofilm formation in S. aureus.\\n\\nImportanceStaphylococcus aureus is the most frequent cause of biofilm-associated infections in hospital settings. The biofilm mode of growth allows the pathogen to escape the host immune response and is extremely difficult to combat, as biofilms are highly resistant to physical and chemical stressors. As outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains become more commonplace, it is essential to understand the pathways involved in biofilm formation in order to target this important virulence factor. Low molecular weight thiols enable S. aureus to combat oxidative and nitrosative stress mechanisms that are used by host cells to defend against infection. Our findings indicate that bacillithiol and nitric oxide, which are produced by S. aureus to combat these host generated stressors, are important for biofilm development, and that disruption of these pathways results in biofilm defects. In the long term, this work may lead to new solutions to eradicate S. aureus biofilms in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we reported that changes in transcription elongation rate affect the efficiency and fidelity of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing, especially of ribosomal protein (RP) transcripts. Here, we analyse these results in more detail, finding that the majority of RP transcripts with non-consensus 5 splice sites have reduced splicing efficiency with faster transcription elongation, and improved efficiency with slower elongation, as might be predicted by the \\\"window of opportunity\\\" model for co-transcriptional splicing. In contrast, both faster and slower elongation reduce splicing fidelity, often for the same splicing events, and both faster and slower transcription increase fidelity with a different set of splicing events. We propose that certain non-consensus 5 splice sites in ribosomal protein transcripts confer a stronger effect of transcription elongation rate on splicing efficiency, possibly by causing a rate-limiting step that delays activation of spliceosomes. The effects of different rates of transcription elongation on splicing fidelity are more difficult to explain by a simple window of opportunity model. We discuss these new findings in the context of current models of co-transcriptional splicing and splicing fidelity.",

    "abstract": "The study of cell biology is limited by the difficulty in visualizing cellular structures at high spatial resolution within their native milieu. Here, we have visualized sporulation in Bacillus subtilis using cryo-electron tomography coupled with cryo-focused ion beam milling, a technique that allows the 3D reconstruction of cellular structures in near-native state at molecular resolution. During sporulation, an asymmetrically-positioned septum divides the cell into a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore. Subsequently, the mother cell phagocytoses the forespore in a process called engulfment, which entails a dramatic rearrangement of the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall around the forespore. By imaging wild-type sporangia, engulfment mutants, and sporangia treated with PG synthesis inhibitors, we show that the initiation of engulfment does not entail the complete dissolution of the septal PG by the mother cell SpoIIDMP complex, as was previously thought. Instead, DMP is required to maintain a flexible septum that is uniformly and only slightly thinned at the onset of engulfment. Then, the mother cell membrane migrates around the forespore by forming tiny finger-like projections, the formation of which requires both SpoIIDMP and new PG synthesized ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane. We propose a molecular model for engulfment membrane migration in which a limited number of SpoIIDMP complexes tether the membrane to and degrade the new PG ahead of the leading edge, thereby generating an irregular engulfing membrane front. Our data also reveal other structures that will provide a valuable resource for future mechanistic studies of endospore formation.",

Here, we address the question whether gonococcal T4P retract in the absence of PilT. We show that pilT deletion strains indeed retract their T4P but the maximum force is reduced to 5 pN. Similarly, the speed of T4P retraction is lower by orders of magnitude compared to T4P retraction driven by PilT. Deleting the pilT paralogues pilU and pilT2 in the{Delta} pilT background did not inhibit T4P retraction, indicating that the PilT-like proteins do not compensate for PilT. Furthermore, we show that depletion of proton motive force did not inhibit pilT-independent T4P retraction. We conclude that the retraction ATPase is not essential for gonococcal T4P retraction. However, the force generated in the absence of PilT is too low to support important functions of T4P including twitching motility, fluidization of colonies, or induction of host cell response.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBacterial type 4 pili (T4P) have been termed the  swiss army knive of bacteria because they perform numerous functions including host cell interaction, twitching motility, colony formation, DNA uptake, protein secretion, and surface sensing. The pilus fibre continuously elongates or retracts and these dynamics are functionally important. Curiously, only a subset of T4P systems employs T4P retraction ATPases to power T4P retraction. Here we show that one of the strongest T4P machines, the gonococcal T4P, retracts without a retraction ATPase. Biophysical characterization reveal strongly reduced force and speed compared to retraction with ATPase. We propose that bacteria encode for retraction ATPases when T4P have to generate high force supporting functions like twitching motility, triggering host cell response, or fluidizing colonies.",

    "abstract": "Many eukaryote species including taxa such as fungi or algae have a lifecycle with substantial haploid and diploid phases. A recent theoretical model predicts that such haploid-diploid lifecycles are stable over long evolutionary time scales when segregating deleterious mutations have stronger effects in homozygous diploids than in haploids and when they are partially recessive in heterozygous diploids. The model predicts that effective dominance, a measure that accounts for these two effects, should be close to 0.5 in these species. It also predicts that diploids should have higher fitness than haploids on average. However, an appropriate statistical framework to conjointly investigate these predictions is currently lacking. In this study, we derive a new quantitative genetic model to test these predictions using fitness data of two haploid parents and their diploid offspring and genome-wide genetic distance between haploid parents. We apply this model to the root-rot basidiomycete fungus Heterobasidion parviporum, a species where the heterokaryotic (equivalent to the diploid) phase is longer than the homokaryotic (haploid) phase. We measured two fitness-related traits (mycelium growth rate and the ability to degrade wood) in both homokaryons and heterokaryons and we used whole-genome sequencing to estimate nuclear genetic distance between parents. Possibly due to a lack of power, we did not find that deleterious mutations were recessive or more deleterious when expressed during the heterokaryotic phase. Using this model to compare effective dominance among haploid-diploid species where the relative importance of the two phases varies should help better understand the evolution of haploid-diploid life cycles.\\n\\nArticle summary for Issue HighlightsMany eukaryote species including taxa such as fungi or algae spend a large portion of their life cycle as haploids and as diploids.

    "abstract": "Abstract (172/175 words)Cell type-specific protein interactomes are promising resources for the understanding of cell functionality and genetic perturbations in cellular states. However, while many low-and top-level aspects of interactome topology have been mapped, we still lack an understanding of the topological motifs at the intermediate level, where connectivity between cellular processes takes place. We combine conventional dendritic cell lineage 1 (cDC1)-specific expression data with a high-quality protein interactome, subsequently creating an information-rich cDC1-specifc interactome matrix that displays topological information on an unprecedented 36.7 million protein pairs at once. By dissecting the interactome-matrix, we reveal that the bow-tie motif is a major connector of cellular processes and an extremely widespread topology in the protein interactome. In aggregation, the bow-tie motifs form a scaffold within the interactome that hierarchically link cellular processes together. We further demonstrate that the bow-tie motifs design can enable protein multifunction. Our generic approach allows a topological characterization and visualization of any large network, facilitating a more effective usage of community-produced interaction data, and is applicable to any cell types interactome.",

    "abstract": "Stress is associated with an increased risk of lung metastasis in melanoma. However, the underlying mechanism is elusive. Oxytocin (OXT), a neurohormone produced by the hypothalamus, plays a vital role in laboring induction and lactation. Emerging evidence suggests that OXT also regulates human emotions, social cognition, social behaviors and stress-related disorders. Here, we reported that a significant up-regulation of oxytocin receptors (OXTRs) was observed in malignant melanoma. The activation of oxytocin receptors (OXTRs) dramatically promoted migration, invasion and angiogenesis but not the proliferation of melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo via {beta}-arrestin 2-dependent ERK-VEGF/ MMP-2 pathway. Next, chronic restraint stress significantly elevated the plasma level of OXT. Notably, 21 days chronic restraint stress facilitated lung metastasis of melanoma and reduced overall survival in mice, which were largely abrogated by knocking down either OXTR or {beta}-arrestin 2. These findings provide evidence that chronic stress hormone-OXT promotes lung metastasis of melanoma via a {beta}-arrestin 2-dependent mechanism and suggest that OXT, a novel pro-metastasis factor, is a potential therapeutic target for melanoma.\\n\\nImportance of the StudyOxytocin, a neuropeptide produced in the hypothalamus that is involved in lactation and parturition, play a vital role in chronic stress-evoked melanoma metastasis via {beta}-arrestin 2-mediated ERK signaling pathway, which provides a potential therapeutic target for melanoma.",

We have previously shown the activation of the MST/LATS/YAP/TAZ signalling cascade in the developing and postnatal mammalian pituitary. Here, we investigate the function of this pathway during pituitary development and in the regulation of the SOX2 cell compartment. Through loss- and gain-of-function genetic approaches, we reveal that restricting YAP/TAZ activation during development is essential for normal organ size and specification from SOX2+ PSCs. Postnatal deletion of LATS kinases and subsequent upregulation of YAP/TAZ leads to uncontrolled clonal expansion of the SOX2+ PSCs and disruption of their differentiation, causing the formation of non-secreting, aggressive pituitary tumours. In contrast, sustained expression of YAP alone results in expansion of SOX2+ PSCs capable of differentiation and devoid of tumourigenic potential. Our findings identify the LATS/YAP/TAZ signalling cascade as an essential component of PSC regulation in normal pituitary physiology and tumourigenesis.",

Interestingly, molecular dynamics studies revealed that phospholipids associate with regions of CFTR proposed to contribute to its channel activity. More directly, we found that CFTR purified together with associated lipids using the amphipol: A8-35, exhibited higher rates of catalytic activity, channel activation and potentiation using ivacaftor, than did CFTR purified in detergent. Catalytic activity in CFTR detergent micelles was partially rescued by addition of phospholipids plus cholesterol, arguing that these lipids contribute directly to its modulation.

    "abstract": "Cell cycle stimulation is a major transforming mechanism of Myc oncoprotein. This is achieved through at least three concomitant mechanisms: upregulation of cyclins and Cdks, downregulation of Cdk inhibitors p15 and p21 and the degradation of p27. The Myc-p27 antagonism has been shown to be relevant in human cancer. To be degraded, p27 must be phosphorylated at Thr-187 to be recognized by Skp2, a component of the ubiquitination complex. We previously described that Myc induces Skp2 expression. Here we show that not only Cdk2 but Cdk1 phosphorylates p27 at the Thr187, which was previously unreported. Moreover, Myc induced p27 degradation in murine fibroblasts through Cdk1 activation, which was achieved by Myc-dependent cyclin A and B induction. In the absence of Cdk2, p27 phosphorylation at Thr-187 was mainly carried out by cyclin A2-Cdk1 and cyclin B1-Cdk1. We also show that Cdk1 inhibition was sufficient for the synthetic lethal interaction with Myc. This result is relevant because Cdk1 is the only Cdk strictly required for cell cycle and the reported synthetic lethal interaction between Cdk1 and Myc.\\n\\nSummary blurbMyc antagonizes p27 activity in cancer. Myc activates Cdk1 to phosphorylate p27, marking p27 for degradation. This depends on Myc-mediated cyclin A and B induction.

If feasible, this relatedness information could be used by a Brain Computer Interface to infer that semantic concept, by integrating the knowledge of the relationship between the multiple probe words and the  unknown target. Such a BCI can take advantage of the N400: an event related potential that is sensitive to semantic content of a stimulus in relation to an established semantic context. However, it is unknown whether the N400 is suited for the multiple probing paradigm we propose, as other intervening words might distract from the established context (i.e., the target word). We perform an experiment in which we present up to ten words after an initial target word, and find no attenuation of the strength of the N400 in grand average ERPs and no decrease in classification accuracy for probes occurring later in the sequences. These results lay the groundwork for the development of a BCI that infers the concept on a users mind through repeated probing.",

    "abstract": "Dragonflies pursue and capture tiny prey and conspecifics with extremely high success rates. These moving targets represent a small visual signal on the retina and successful chases require accurate detection and amplification by downstream neuronal circuits. This amplification has been observed in a population of neurons called Small Target Motion Detectors (STMDs), through a mechanism we termed predictive gain modulation. As targets drift through the receptive field responses build slowly over time. This gain is modulated across the receptive field, enhancing sensitivity just ahead of the targets path, with suppression of activity elsewhere in the surround. Whilst some properties of this mechanism have been described, it is not yet known which stimulus parameters are required to generate this gain modulation. Previous work suggested that the strength of gain enhancement was predominantly determined by the duration of the targets prior path. Here we show that the predictive gain modulation is more than a sluggish build-up of gain over time. Rather, gain is dependent on both past and present parameters of the stimulus. We also describe response variability as a major challenge of target detecting neurons and propose that the predictive gain modulations role is to drive neurons into response saturation, thus minimising neuronal variability despite noisy visual input signals.",

Alternatively, recoding posits that learning creates new and more efficient representations of the learned sequences. Importantly, both models propose that humans act as optimal learners but capture different statistics of the stimuli in their internal model. Furthermore, these models make dissociable predictions as to how learning changes the neural representation of sequences. We tested these predictions by using fMRI to extract neural activity patters from the dorsal visual processing stream during a sequence recall task. We observed that only the recoding account can explain the similarity of neural activity patterns, suggesting that participants recode the learned sequences using chunks. We show that associative learning can theoretically store only very limited number of overlapping sequences, such as common in ecological working memory tasks, and hence an efficient learner should recode initial sequence representations.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing observation about primary visual cortex (V1) is that the stimulus selectivity of neurons can be well explained with a cascade of linear computations followed by a nonlinear rectification stage. This framework remains highly influential in systems neuroscience and has also inspired recent efforts in artificial intelligence. The success of these models include describing the disparity-selectivity of binocular neurons in V1. Some aspects of real neuronal disparity responses are hard to explain with simple linear-nonlinear models, notably the attenuated response of real cells to \\\"anticorrelated\\\" stimuli which violate natural binocular image statistics. General linear-nonlinear models can account for this attenuation, but no one has yet tested whether they quantitatively match the response of real neurons. Here, we exhaustively test this framework using recently developed optimisation techniques. We show that many cells are very poorly characterised by even general linear-nonlinear models. Strikingly, the models can account for neuronal responses to unnatural anticorrelated stimuli as well as to most natural, correlated stimuli. However, the models fail to capture the particularly strong response to binocularly correlated stimuli at the preferred disparity of the cell. Thus, V1 neurons perform an amplification of responses to correlated stimuli which cannot be accounted for by a linear-nonlinear cascade. The implication is that even simple stimulus selectivity in V1 requires more complex computations than previously envisaged.\\n\\nSignificance statementA long-standing question in sensory systems neuroscience is whether the computations performed by neurons in primary visual cortex can be described by repeated elements of linear-nonlinear units (a linear filtering/pooling stage followed by a subsequent output nonlinearity, such as a squaring). This question goes back to the Nobel-prize winning work by Hubel & Wiesel who argued that orientation selectivity in V1 can qualitatively be explained in this way. In this paper, we show that V1 neurons have an amplification of their response to stimuli which are contrast matched in the two eyes, and that the recovered models cannot describe this property. We argue that this likely represents more sophisticated computations than can be compactly described by the linear-nonlinear cascade framework.",

There is great success currently in the dissection of the genetic components underlying risk-conferring transcriptomic networks. However, the study of regulating effect of epigenetics, as a modulator of environmental factors, in the etiopathogenesis of SCZ still faces many challenges. In this work we investigated DNA methylation and gene expression from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) region of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls using weighted correlation network approaches. We identified and replicated two expression and two methylation modules significantly associated with SCZ. Among them, one pair of expression and methylation modules were significantly overlapped in the module genes which were enriched in astrocyte-associated functional pathways, and specifically expressed in astrocytes. Another two linked expression-methylation module pairs were involved aging process with module genes mostly related to oligodendrocyte development and myelination, and specially expressed in oligodendrocytes. Further examination of underlying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) showed significant enrichment in genetic risk of most psychiatric disorders for expression QTLs but not for methylation QTLs. These results support the coherence between methylation and gene expression in a network level, and suggest a combinatorial effect of genetics and epigenetics in regulating gene expression networks specific to glia cells in relation with SCZ and aging process.",

Deprivation of binaural experience during an early critical period is often blamed for this shortcoming. However, we show that neonatally deafened rats provided with precisely synchronized CI stimulation in adulthood can be trained to localize ITDs with essentially normal behavioral thresholds near 50 s. Furthermore, neonatally deaf rats show high physiological sensitivity to ITDs immediately after binaural implantation in adulthood. The fact that our neonatally deaf CI rats achieved very good behavioral ITD thresholds while prelingually deaf human CI patients usually fail to develop a useful sensitivity to ITD raises urgent questions about whether shortcomings in technology or treatment may be behind the usually poor binaural outcomes for current binaural CI patients.",

    "abstract": "Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is a peculiar neural state showing a combination of muscle atonia and intense cortical activity. REM sleep is usually considered as a unitary state in neuroscientific research; however, it is composed of two different microstates: phasic and tonic REM. These differ in awakening thresholds, sensory processing, and cortical oscillations. Nevertheless, studies examining cortical oscillations during REM microstates are scarce, and used low spatial sampling. Here, we analyzed the data of 18 healthy individuals assessed by high-density sleep EEG recordings. We systematically contrasted phasic and tonic REM periods in terms of topographical distribution, source localization, as well as local, global and long-range synchronization of frequency-specific cortical activity. Tonic periods showed relatively increased high alpha and beta power over frontocentral derivations. In addition, higher frequency components of beta power exhibited increased global synchronization during tonic compared to phasic states. In contrast, in phasic periods we found increased power and synchronization of low frequency oscillations coexisting with increased and synchronized gamma activity. Source localization revealed several multimodal, higher-order associative, as well as sensorimotor areas as potential sources of increased high alpha/beta power during tonic compared to phasic REM. Increased gamma power in phasic REM was attributed to medial prefrontal and right lateralized temporal areas associated with emotional processing. Our findings emphasize the heterogeneous nature of REM sleep, expressed in two microstates with remarkably different neural activity. Considering the microarchitecture of REM sleep may provide new insights into the mechanisms of REM sleep in health and disease.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRapid Eye movement (REM) is composed of the alternation of two markedly different microstates: phasic and tonic REM. Here we present the first high-resolution topographical study that systematically contrasted spectral power, neural synchronization and brain topography of spontaneous cortical oscillations across phasic and tonic microstates. Phasic REM was characterized by the combination of synchronized low frequency oscillations resembling deeper sleep stages and high frequency oscillations reflecting intense cortical activity. In contrast, tonic REM sleep showed increased oscillatory activity in the alpha and beta ranges that may reflect a shift towards increased environmental alertness resembling resting wakefulness. Exploring the neurophysiological aspects of REM microstates may shed new light on the mechanisms of REM sleep in healthy and pathological conditions.",

    "abstract": "How we process ongoing experiences is shaped by our personal history, current needs, and future goals. Consequently, brain regions involved in generating these subjective appraisals, such as the vmPFC, often appear to be heterogeneous across individuals even in response to the same external information. To elucidate the role of the vmPFC in processing our ongoing experiences, we developed a computational framework and analysis pipeline to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual vmPFC responses as participants viewed a 45-minute television drama. Through a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging, facial expression tracking, and self-reported emotional experiences across four studies, our data suggest that the vmPFC slowly transitions through a series of discretized states that broadly map onto affective experiences. Although these transitions typically occur at idiosyncratic times across people, participants exhibited a marked increase in state alignment during high affectively valenced events in the show. Our work suggests that the vmPFC ascribes affective meaning to our ongoing experiences.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria in neurons in addition to their primary role in bioenergetics also contribute to specialized functions including regulation of synaptic transmission, Ca2+ homeostasis, neuronal excitability and stress adaptation. However, the factors that influence mitochondrial biogenesis and function in neurons remain poorly elucidated. Here, we identify an important role for serotonin (5-HT) as a regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function in rodent cortical neurons, via a 5-HT2A receptor-mediated recruitment of the SIRT1-PGC-1 axis, which is relevant to the neuroprotective action of 5-HT. 5-HT increased mitochondrial biogenesis, reflected through enhanced mtDNA levels, mitotracker staining, and expression of mitochondrial genes. This was accompanied by increased cellular ATP levels, basal and maximal respiration, as well as spare respiratory capacity. Mechanistically the effects of 5-HT were mediated via the 5-HT2A receptor and master modulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, SIRT1 and PGC-1. SIRT1 was required to mediate the effects of 5-HT on mitochondrial biogenesis and function in cortical neurons. In vivo studies revealed that 5-HT2A receptor stimulation increased cortical mtDNA and ATP levels, in a SIRT1 dependent manner. In cortical neurons, 5-HT enhanced expression of anti-oxidant enzymes, decreased cellular reactive oxygen species, and exhibited neuroprotection against excitotoxic and oxidative stress, an effect that required SIRT1. These findings identify 5-HT as a novel upstream regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function in cortical neurons, and implicate the mitochondrial effects of 5-HT in its neuroprotective action.",
