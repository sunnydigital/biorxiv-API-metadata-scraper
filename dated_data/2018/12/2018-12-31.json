    "abstract": "Human hookworm Necator Americanus (NA) causes iron deficiency anemia, as the parasite ingests blood from the gastrointestinal tract of its human host. This bioinformatics-based study focuses on eight of the cathepsin B-like cysteine proteases (CPs) of the worm to explore their pathogenic potential. CP1 - CP6, which harbored the active site cysteine residue for enzymatic activity, were relevantly observed to have N-terminal signal peptide for extracellular localization. The secretory CPs could be releasing indigenous worm heparin at the host-pathogen interface for anticoagulation purposes. CP2 and CP3 showed a novel hemoglobinase motif that could be a prerequisite for hemoglobin degradation. CP1 and CP6 shared similar enzymatic-pocket features with cathepsin B and cruzain that cleave high molecular weight kininogen for blood-thinning activity. CP1, CP2, CP3, CP5 and CP6 were predicted to bind heparin, at their C terminal domain, like human cathepsin B and cruzain non-covalently bind heparin to enhance their activity. NA CPs action in concert with heparin, have implications for anti-heparin and heparin analog design against hookworm infection.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is a globally distributed, obligate pathogen of humans that can be divided into seven clearly defined lineages. Identifying how the ancestral clone of M.tb spread and differentiated is important for identifying the ecological drivers of the current pandemic. We reconstructed M.tb migration in Africa and Eurasia, and investigated lineage specific patterns of spread. Applying evolutionary rates inferred with ancient M.tb genome calibration, we link M.tb dispersal to historical phenomena that altered patterns of connectivity throughout Africa and Eurasia: trans-Indian Ocean trade in spices and other goods, the Silk Road and its predecessors, the expansion of the Roman Empire and, the European Age of Exploration. We find that Eastern Africa and Southeast Asia have been critical in the dispersal of M.tb. Our results reveal complex relationships between spatial dispersal and expansion of M.tb populations, and delineate the independent evolutionary trajectories of bacterial sub-populations underlying the current pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Cryptosporidiosis, a disease marked by diarrhea in adults and stunted growth in children, is associated with the unicellular protozoan pathogen Cryptosporidium; often the species parvum. Cryptopain-1, a cysteine protease characterized in the genome of Cryptosporidium parvum, had been earlier shown to be inhibited by a vinyl sulfone compound called K11777 (or K-777). Cysteine proteases have long been established as valid drug targets, which can be covalently and selectively inhibited by vinyl sulfones. This computational study was initiated to identify purchasable vinyl sulfone compounds, which could possibly inhibit cryptopain-1 with higher efficacy than K11777. Docking simulations screened a number of such possibly better inhibitors. The work was furthered to probe the enzymatic pocket of cryptopain-1, through in-silico mutations, to derive a map of receptor-ligand interactions in the docked complexes. The idea was to provide crucial clues to aid the design of inhibitors, which would be able to bind the protease well by making favorable interactions with important residues of the enzyme. The analyses dictated placement of ligands towards the front of the enzymatic cleft, and disfavored interactions deep within. The S1 and S2 subsites of the enzyme preferred to remain occupied by polar ligand subgroups. Reasonably distanced ring systems and polar backbones of ligands were desired across the cleft. Large as well as inflexible subgroups were not tolerated. Double ringed systems such as substituted napthalene, especially in S1, were exceptions though. The S2 subsite, which is typically a specificity determinant in papain (C1) family cysteine proteases such as cathepsin L-like cryptopain-1, can possibly accommodate polar and hydrophobic ligand subgroups alike.",

Nanotubes typically appear as thin and cylindrical tubes, but they may also have a beaded architecture along the tube. In this paper, we study the role of membrane mechanics in governing the architecture of these tubes and show that the formation of beadlike structures along the nanotubes can result from local heterogeneities in the membrane either due to protein aggregation or due to membrane composition. We present numerical results that predict how membrane properties, protein density, and local tension compete to create a phase space that governs the morphology of a nanotube. We also find that there is an energy barrier that prevents two beads from fusing. These results suggest that the membrane-protein interaction, membrane composition, and membrane tension closely govern the tube radius, number of beads, and the bead morphology.",

    "abstract": "Sleep slow waves are known to participate in memory consolidation, yet slow waves occurring under anesthesia present no positive effects on memory. Here, we shed light onto this paradox, based on a combination of extracellular recordings in vivo, in vitro, and computational models. We find two types of slow waves, based on analyzing the temporal patterns of successive slow-wave events. The first type is consistently observed in natural slow-wave sleep, while the second is shown to be ubiquitous under anesthesia. Network models of spiking neurons predict that the two slow wave types emerge due to a different gain on inhibitory vs excitatory cells and that different levels of spike-frequency adaptation in excitatory cells can account for dynamical distinctions between the two types. This prediction was tested in vitro by varying adaptation strength using an agonist of acetylcholine receptors, which demonstrated a neuromodulatory switch between the two types of slow waves. Finally, we show that the first type of slow-wave dynamics is more sensitive to external stimuli, which can explain how slow waves in sleep and anesthesia differentially affect memory consolidation, as well as provide a link between slow-wave dynamics and memory diseases.",

    "abstract": "Previously, the effect of a drug on a cell population was measured based on simple metrics such as cell viability. However, as single-cell technologies are becoming more advanced, drug screen experiments can now be conducted with more complex readouts such as gene expression profiles of individual cells. The increasing complexity of measurements from these multi-sample experiments calls for more sophisticated analytical approaches than are currently available. We developed a novel method called PhEMD (Phenotypic Earth Movers Distance) and show that it can be used to embed the space of drug perturbations on the basis of the drugs effects on cell populations. When testing PhEMD on a newly-generated, 300-sample CyTOF kinase inhibition screen experiment, we find that the state space of the perturbation conditions is surprisingly low-dimensional and that the network of drugs demonstrates manifold structure. We show that because of the fairly simple manifold geometry of the 300 samples, we can accurately capture the full range of drug effects using a dictionary of only 30 experimental conditions. We also show that new drugs can be added to our PhEMD embedding using similarities inferred from other characterizations of drugs using a technique called Nystrom extension. Our findings suggest that large-scale drug screens can be conducted by measuring only a small fraction of the drugs using the most expensive high-throughput single-cell technologies--the effects of other drugs may be inferred by mapping and extending the perturbation space. We additionally show that PhEMD can be useful for analyzing other types of single-cell samples, such as patient tumor biopsies, by mapping the patient state space in a similar way as the drug state space. We demonstrate that PhEMD is scalable, compatible with leading batch effect correction techniques, and generalizable to multiple experimental designs. Altogether, our analyses suggest that PhEMD may facilitate drug discovery efforts and help uncover the network geometry of a collection of single-cell samples.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans, a species of fungi, can thrive in diverse niches of its mammalian hosts; it is a normal resident of the GI tract and mucosal surfaces but it can also enter the bloodstream and colonize internal organs causing serious disease. The ability of C. albicans to thrive in these different host environments has been attributed, at least in part, to its ability to assume different morphological forms. In this work, we examine one such morphological change known as white-opaque switching. White cells are the default state of C. albicans, and most animal studies have been carried out exclusively with white cells. Here, we compared the proliferation of white and opaque cells in two murine models of infection and also monitored, using specially constructed strains, switching between the two states in the host. We found that white cells outcompeted opaque cells in many niches; however, we show for the first time that in some organs (specifically, the heart and spleen), opaque cells competed favorably with white cells and, when injected on their own, could colonize these organs. In environments where the introduced white cells outcompeted the introduced opaque cells, we observed high rates of opaque-to-white switching. We did not observe white-to-opaque switching in any of the niches we examined.",

    "abstract": "Background and objectivesAlzheimers disease (AD) is the progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by dementia, but no peripheral biomarkers available yet that can detect the AD. This study aimed to identify systems biomarker signatures in the AD through integrative analyses.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsWe used two microarray transcriptomics datasets of blood from AD patients to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Geneset and protein overrepresentation analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI), DEGs-Transcription Factor interactions, DEGs-MicroRNAs interactions, protein-drug interactions, and protein subcellular localizations analyses were done on common DEGs.\\n\\nResultsTotal 25 DEGs were detected between the two datasets. Integration of DEGs with biomolecular networks revealed hub proteins (TUBB, ATF3, NOL6, UQCRC1, SND1, CASP2, BTF3, INPP5K, VCAM1, and CSTF1), TFs (FOXC1, ZNF3, GEMIN7, and SMG9), miRNAs (mir-20a-5p, mir-93-5p, mir-16-5p, let-7b-5p, mir-708-5p, mir-24-3p, mir-26b-5p, mir-17-5p, mir-4270, and mir-4441). The analyses revealed candidate blood based biomarkers in the AD. We evaluated the histone modifications of the identified biomolecules. The hub genes and transcription factors (TFs) revealed that they possess several histone modification sites associated with Alzheimers disease. The protein-drug interactions revealed 10 candidate drugs consisting of antineoplastic (Vinorelbine, Vincristine, Vinblastine, Epothilone D, Epothilone B, CYT997, and ZEN-012), dermatologicals (Podofilox), and immunosuppressive agents (Colchicine) that may target the candidate systems biomarkers. The subcellular localization analysis revealed the interactions of the DEGs range from nucleus to plasma membrane through cytosol.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study presents blood based systems molecular biomarker signatures at RNA and protein levels which might be useful as peripheral biomarkers in the AD. The candidate drugs, histone modification sites, and subcellular localizations will be useful in future drug design in the AD.",

However, this analysis is challenging because of a lack of microscope hardware and software suitable for single-cell tracking analysis of a wide range of cell types and densities. We therefore developed a computerized single-cell lineage tracking analysis system based on a microscope optimized for differential interference contrast-based long-term live cell imaging, with software designed to automatically generate live cell videos, perform image segmentation, carry out single-cell tracking, and create and analyze a cell lineage database. We previously reported that minor cell sub-populations (3%-7%) within a cultured cancer cell line could play a critical role in maintaining the cell population. Given that sub-population characterization requires large-scale single-cell tracking analysis, we tracked single cells using the above computerized system and identified a minor cell population (1.5%) composed of Sambucus nigra agglutinin-I-positive cells, which acted as stem-like cells for the established culture. These results demonstrate the potential value of this computerized single-cell lineage tracking analysis system as a routine tool in cell biology, opening new avenues for research aimed at identifying previously unknown characteristics of individual cultured cells with high accuracy.",

Here we show that baseline systemic CD4 immunity is a differential factor for clinical responses. Patients with functional systemic CD4 T cells included all objective responders and could be identified before the start of therapy by having a high proportion of memory CD4 T cells. In these patients CD4 T cells possessed significant proliferative capacities, co-expressed low levels of PD-1/LAG-3 and were responsive to PD-1 blockade ex vivo and in vivo. In contrast, patients with dysfunctional systemic CD4 immunity did not respond even though they had circulating lung cancer antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells. CD4 T cells in these patients proliferated very poorly, strongly co-upregulated PD-1/LAG-3 after stimulation, and were largely refractory to PD-1 monoblockade ex vivo and in vivo. Although baseline CD8 immunity was strongly dysfunctional in all patients before the start of therapy, it only recovered in patients with functional CD4 immunity. CD4 and CD8 T cell dysfunctionality was caused by PD-1/LAG-3 co-expression, which could be reverted by PD-1/LAG-3 co-blockade. Patients with functional CD4 immunity and PD-L1 tumor positivity exhibited response rates of 70%, highlighting the contribution of CD4 immunity for efficacious PD-L1/PD-1 blockade therapy.",

Due to the heterogeneity of mutations, it is necessary to purify cell clones grown in high dilution until colony formation, which can be a time consuming process. Here we tested a modified approach in which we seeded cells in high dilution, together with non-edited carrier cells. As a comparison, cells were also grown in high dilution with conditioned medium from a high density culture. When using carrier cells or conditioned medium, the formation of cell colonies is accelerated. Additionally, clones grown with carrier cells are more similar to the parental lines in terms of their tumorigenic properties. Surprisingly, key signaling cascades are very divergent between clones isolated from low density cultures, even with conditioned medium, in contrast to clones isolated with carrier cells. Thus, our study uncovers a significant limitation using the common approach of isolating cell clones following genetic modifications and suggests an alternative method that mitigates the problem of heterogeneity of gene expression between clones.\\n\\nSummary statementWe show here that standard methods of generating cell clones after CRISPR/Cas9 treatment result in highly divergent signaling cascades among clones.

Despite such a distinct defect no model fully explains their molecular configuration. We show that CFSs are characterised by impaired chromatin folding manifested as disrupted mitotic structures visible using molecular FISH probes in the presence and absence of replication stress. Chromosome condensation assays reveal that compaction-resistant chromatin lesions persist at CFSs throughout the cell cycle and mitosis. Subsequently cytogenetic and molecular lesions arise due to faulty condensin loading at CFSs, through a defect in condensin I mediated compaction and are coincident with mitotic DNA synthesis (MIDAS). This model suggests that in conditions of exogenous replication stress, aberrant condensin loading leads to molecular defects and CFS formation, concomitantly providing an environment for MIDAS, which, if not resolved, result in chromosome instability.",

    "abstract": "Many instances of cellular signaling and transcriptional regulation involve switch-like molecular responses to the presence or absence of input ligands. To understand how these responses come about and how they can be harnessed, we develop a statistical mechanical model to characterize the types of Boolean logic that can arise from allosteric molecules following the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model. Building upon previous work, we show how an allosteric molecule regulated by two inputs can elicit AND, OR, NAND and NOR responses, but is unable to realize XOR or XNOR gates. Next, we demonstrate the ability of an MWC molecule to perform ratiometric sensing - a response behavior where activity depends monotonically on the ratio of ligand concentrations. We then extend our analysis to more general schemes of combinatorial control involving either additional binding sites for the two ligands or an additional third ligand and show how these additions can cause a switch in the logic behavior of the molecule. Overall, our results demonstrate the wide variety of control schemes that biological systems can implement using simple mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The unidirectional and opposite-polarity microtubule-based motors, dynein and kinesin, drive long-distance intracellular cargo transport. Cellular observations support the existence of mechanisms to couple opposite polarity motors: in cells some cargos rapidly switch directions and kinesin motors can be used to localize dynein. We recently identified an interaction between the cytoplasmic dynein-1 activating adaptor HOOK3 and the kinesin-3 KIF1C. Here we show that KIF1C and dynein/dynactin can exist in a single complex scaffolded by HOOK3. Full-length HOOK3 binds to and activates dynein/dynactin motility. HOOK3 also binds to a short region in the \\\"tail\\\" of KIF1C, but unlike dynein/dynactin, this interaction does not affect the processive motility of KIF1C. HOOK3 scaffolding allows dynein to transport KIF1C towards the microtubule minus end, and KIF1C to transport dynein towards the microtubule plus end. We propose that linking dynein and kinesin motors by dynein activating adaptors may be a general mechanism to regulate bidirectional motility.",

Here, we quantify aneuploidy-inducing perturbations by live cell fluorescence monitoring for changes in chromosome-5 in a lung cancer line and in normal diploid iPS cells. Inhibition of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and knockdown of DNA repair factors cause chromosome mis-segregation to increase several-fold above a low baseline level, and both perturbations also generate several-fold more rare fluorescent-null cells. Loss of chromosome-5 is confirmed by single cell karyotyping, SNP arrays on stable isolated clones, and downregulated expression of genes on chromosome-5 in single cell transcriptomics. The iPS cells also show loss of fluorescence in infrequent cells after SAC inhibition and upon growth as teratomas in mice. Viability, selection, and altered expression can thus be tracked to reveal molecular mechanisms in aneuploidy.",

    "abstract": "Sticker sarcoma - a highly aneuploid, contagious neoplasm circulating in a domestic dog population - is broadly referred as a canine transmissible venereal tumour (CTVT). The karyotype of transmissible Sticker sarcoma appears as a collage of numerical and structural aberrations; the CTVT genome represents the generalized but stable neoplastic aneuploidy of monoclonal origins. Presented is an analysis of genetic events and variants underlying the aneuploid genomic structure of Sticker sarcoma described previously by Murchison et al. (2014) and Decker et al. (2015). Here we explored the above CTVT genomic compendia and mined the existing data - specifically looking for cases of convergence of multiple non-synonymous variants onto a single gene - the mutational patterns indicative for Knudsonian  two-hit kinetics. A Table I is given, providing theoretical estimates of retaining the intact wild-type copy, expected as a function of a cumulative mutational convergence observed in unphased sequence consensus. We demonstrate that the two canine RecQ-like helicases: Bloom syndrome helicase and RECQL4, encoded by the aneuploid transmissible tumour, have accumulated a multitude of different mutations. Among the sets of most intensely mutated transmissible sarcoma genes, we also identified a canine FANCD2 - yet another previously unnoticed multiple-hit candidate factor. We discuss a possible role of mutated RecQ-like helicases and other cooperating factors, perceivably involved in the maintenance of the neoplastic aneuploidy. We suggest the proposed cooperative actions of CTVT RecQ-like DNA helicases could be relevant interpreting whether variants contributing to RecQ-dependent karyotypic traits, respond to selective pressures that preserve the aneuploid genomic structure of transmissible Sticker sarcoma.\\n\\nO_TBL View this table:\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13a4d4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1aa8257org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15354faorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1efecd7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a650aa_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL O_FLOATNOTable I.C_FLOATNO O_TABLECAPTIONDefined as an absolute complement of the corresponding rates - the theoretical expectations - predict the second-hit candidates retain only 50% chance of attaining the out-of-phase trans-heterozygous Knudsonian inheritance model, while multiple-hit candidates retain out-of-phase likelihoods equal or greater than 75%.

    "abstract": "Monensin-sensitive 1 (Mon1) is an endocytic regulator that participates in the conversion of Rab5 positive early endosomes to Rab7 positive late endosomes. In Drosophila, loss of mon1 (Dmon1) leads to sterility. The Dmon1 mutant females have extremely small ovaries with complete absence of late stage egg chambers-a phenotype reminiscent of mutations in the insulin pathway genes. Consistently, we find that expression of many Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps) is down regulated in Dmon1 mutants. Conversely, feeding an insulin-rich diet can rescue the ovarian defects induced by the loss of Dmon1.\\n\\nSurprisingly however, Dmon1 is required in the tyramine/octopaminergic neurons (OPNs) and not in the ovaries or the insulin producing cells (IPCs). Thus, knockdown of Dmon1 in just the OPNs is sufficient to mimic the ovarian phenotype while expression of Dmon1 in the OPNs alone, is sufficient to  rescue the mutant defect.\\n\\nLastly, we have identified dilp5 as a critical target of Dmon1. Both, protein and mRNA levels of Dilp5 levels are reduced in Dmon1 mutants and IPC-specific dilp5 over expression can ameliorate the Dmon1 dependent sterility defect. The study thus identifies Dmon1 as a novel molecular player in the brain-gonad axis and underscores the significance of inter-organ systemic communication during development.\\n\\nSignificance Statement Functional significance of the long-distance systemic communication during organogenesis has emerged as a major area of enquiry. We have focused our attention on an endocytic regulator DMon1, that appears to participate in a  remote control type of mechanism. We report a novel tripartite circuitry that involves Dmon1 activity in Octopaminergic neurons, its influence on insulin production in the insulin producing cells (IPCs) which, in turn, is required for the progression of oogenesis. Our results document a spatially remote non-autonomous control mechanism involving neuronal cross-talk that orchestrates developmental regulation of oogenesis. Importantly our data provide a unique example of how distinct neuronal hubs can engineer metabolic pathways underlying growth/differentiation and highlight the importance of systemic regulation of organogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Tissue maintenance requires adequate cell proliferation and a directed plane of cell division. Retraction fibres can determine the plane of cell division by directing spindle movements; however, retraction fibre components that direct spindle movements remain unclear. We report MARK2/Par1b kinase as a novel component of actin-rich retraction fibres, important for directed spindle movements. A kinase-dead mutant of MARK2 reveals MARK2s ability to monitor actin status. MARK2s localisation at retraction fibres, but not the rest of the cortical membrane or centrosome, is dependent on its kinase activity, highlighting a specialised spatial regulation of MARK2. By subtly perturbing the actin cytoskeleton, we demonstrate MARK2s role in correcting spindle off-centering, induced by lesions in actin assembly. In addition to this mitotic role, we show MARK2s post-mitotic role in ensuring normal G1-S progression and cell proliferation. We propose that MARK2 provides a molecular framework to integrate cortical signals and cytoskeletal changes in both mitosis and interphase.\\n\\nShort SummaryCoordination of cell proliferation and division is important for tissue maintenance.

    "abstract": "Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are membraneless liquid condensates that dynamically form, dissolve, and mature into a gel-like state in response to changing cellular environment. RNP condensation is largely governed by the promiscuous attractive inter-chain interactions, mediated by low-complexity domains (LCDs). Using an archetypal disordered RNP, Fused in Sarcoma (FUS), here we study how molecular crowding impacts the RNP liquid condensation. We observe that the liquid-liquid coexistence boundary of FUS is lowered by polymer crowders, consistent with the excluded volume model. With increasing bulk crowder concentration, RNP partition increases and the diffusion rate decreases in the condensed phase. Furthermore, we show that RNP condensates undergo substantial hardening wherein protein-dense droplets transition from viscous fluid to a viscoelastic gel-like state in a crowder concentration-dependent manner. Utilizing two distinct LCDs that broadly represent the most commonly occurring sequence motifs driving RNP phase transition, we reveal that the impact of crowding is largely independent of LCD charge/sequence patterns. These results are consistent with a thermodynamic model of crowder-mediated depletion interaction where inter-RNP attraction is enhanced by molecular crowding. The depletion force is likely to play key roles in tuning the physical properties of RNP condensates within a crowded intracellular space.",

Here we present 5 Experiments that, together, dispute a view of retinotopically-mapped neural populations dedicated to causality detection. We first point to key issues in previous studies of causality adaptation. Then we extend the basic causality adaptation paradigm to show that causality aftereffects occur in spatially global visual space. We directly compare causality aftereffects to the motion aftereffect to show important differences in their co-ordinate mapping.

To identify the underpinnings of heat tolerance and symbiosis, we compared the in hospite and free-living transcriptomes of D. trenchii under stable temperature conditions and acute hyperthermal stress. We discovered that under stable conditions, in hospite cells exhibit lower transcriptional activity than free-living counterparts, suggesting the shutdown of genes uniquely required for a free-living lifestyle. However, under hyperthermal stress the transcriptional response was larger in hospite, indicating an exacerbated stress environment within the host cell. Significantly, we unraveled the molecular signatures of symbiont heat tolerance within the host, which is a critical step to enable the development of engineered endosymbionts as a tool for restoration of coral reefs.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic Nucleotide Gated Ion Channels (CNGCs) have been firmly established as Ca2+-conducting ion channels that regulate a wide variety of physiological responses in plants. CNGC2 has been implicated in plant immunity and Ca2+ signaling due to the autoimmune phenotypes exhibited by null mutants of CNGC2. However, cngc2 mutants display additional phenotypes that are unique among autoimmune mutants, suggesting that CNGC2 has functions beyond defense and generates distinct Ca2+ signals in response to different triggers. In this study we found that cngc2 mutants showed reduced gravitropism, consistent with a defect in auxin signaling. This was mirrored in the diminished auxin response detected by the auxin reporters DR5::GUS and DII-VENUS and in a strongly impaired auxin-induced Ca2+ response. Moreover, the cngc2 mutant exhibits higher levels of the endogenous auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indicating that excess auxin in cngc2 causes its pleiotropic phenotypes. These auxin signaling defects and the autoimmunity syndrome of cngc2 could be suppressed by loss-of-function mutations in the auxin biosynthesis gene YUCCA6 (YUC6), as determined by identification of the cngc2 suppressor mutant repressor of cngc2 (rdd1) as an allele of YUC6. A loss-of-function mutation in the upstream auxin biosynthesis gene TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS (TAA1, WEAK ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE8) also suppressed the cngc2 phenotypes, further supporting the tight relationship between CNGC2 and the TAA-YUC-dependent auxin biosynthesis pathway. Taking these results together, we propose that the Ca2+ signal generated by CNGC2 is a part of the negative feedback regulation of auxin homeostasis in which CNGC2 balances cellular auxin perception by influencing auxin biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR) requires an efficient and timely search for a homologous template. Here we first study global chromatin re-organization following a single DSB: due to the potential release of cross-linkers such as cohesin and CTCF molecules near the DSB site, loops are released and chromatin is decondensed, explaining the change of chromatin locus motion at larger genomic distances. This mechanism provides an elementary explanation for the increase of the anomalous exponent at sites located far away from the DSB, after break induction. Second, we explore the consequences of chromatin reorganization for the homology search during DNA repair: using polymer models, we estimate the mean first encounter time (MFET) between two loci on the chromatin in a confined nucleus. Reducing tethering forces, as reported experimentally on chromatin, is associated with a local de-condensation near the break followed by the extrusion of the breaks. Consequently, we report here that the mean first encounter time between homologous sites is decreased by two orders of magnitude even when the homologue sequence is located on the nuclear boundary. To conclude, our results suggest that local changes in inter-nucleosomal contacts near DSBs, by cohesin removal, remodel the chromatin and drastically shorten the time required to complete a long-range search for a homologous template.",

    "abstract": "A key goal of whole genome sequencing (WGS) for human genetics studies is to interrogate all forms of variation, including single nucleotide variants (SNV), small insertion/deletion (indel) variants and structural variants (SV). However, tools and resources for the study of SV have lagged behind those for smaller variants. Here, we used a cloud-based pipeline to map and characterize SV in 17,795 deeply sequenced human genomes from common disease trait mapping studies. We publicly release site-frequency information to create the largest WGS-based SV resource to date. On average, individuals carry 2.9 rare SVs that alter coding regions, which affect the dosage or structure of 4.2 genes and account for 4.0-11.2% of rare high-impact coding alleles. Based on a computational model, we estimate that SVs account for 17.2% of rare alleles genome-wide whose predicted deleterious effects are equivalent to loss-of-function (LoF) coding alleles; ~90% of such SVs are non-coding deletions (mean 19.1 per genome). We report 158,991 ultra-rare SVs and show that ~2% of individuals carry ultra-rare megabase-scale SVs, nearly half of which are balanced and/or complex rearrangements. Finally, we exploit this resource to infer the dosage sensitivity of genes and non-coding elements, revealing strong trends related to regulatory element class, conservation and cell-type specificity. This work will help guide SV analysis and interpretation in the era of WGS.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) is a molecular complex which powers the rotation of the filament that propels swimming bacteria. Rotational torque is generated by harnessing the flow of ions through ion channels known as stators which couple the energy from the ion gradient across the inner membrane to rotation of the rotor. Here we used error-prone PCR to introduce single point mutations into the sodium-powered Vibrio alginolyticus/Eschrichia Coli chimeric stator PotB. We then selected for motors that exhibited resistance to the sodium-channel inhibitor phenamil. We found that single mutations that inferred resistance to phenamil occurred at two sites: 1) the transmembrane domain of PotB, corresponding to the TM region of the PomB stator from V. alginolyticus, and 2) near the peptidoglycan (PG) binding region that corresponds to the C-terminal region of the MotB stator from E. coli. We corroborated our swim plate observations with single cell rotation assays to confirm that individual cells could drive rotation of flagellar motors in the presence of up to 100 M phenamil. Our results demonstrate that it is not only the pore region of the stator that moderates the effect of motility in the presence of ion-channel blockers. We hypothesise that mutations in the PG region can allow motors to function in the presence of phenamil by allowing multiple semi-functioning stators to persist on the motor and drive flagellar rotation.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) result in failure of myelination and severe neurological dysfunction in the X-linked pediatric leukodystrophy Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). The majority of PLP1 variants, including supernumerary copies and various point mutations, lead to early mortality. However, PLP1-null patients and mice display comparatively mild phenotypes, suggesting that reduction of aberrant PLP1 expression might provide a therapeutic strategy across PMD genotypes. Here we show, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated germline knockdown of Plp1 in the severe jimpy (Plp1jp) point mutation mouse model of PMD rescued myelinating oligodendrocytes, nerve conduction velocity, motor function, and lifespan to wild-type levels, thereby validating PLP1 suppression as a therapeutic approach. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of Plp1 suppression in postnatal PMD mice, we tested antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that stably decrease mouse Plp1 mRNA and protein in vivo. Administration of a single intraventricular dose of Plp1-targeted ASOs to postnatal jimpy mice increased myelination, improved motor behavior, and extended lifespan through an 8-month endpoint. Collectively, these results support the development of PLP1 suppression as a disease-modifying therapy for most PMD patients. More broadly, we demonstrate that RNA therapeutics can be delivered to oligodendrocytes in vivo to modulate neurological function and lifespan, opening a new treatment modality for myelin disorders.",

    "abstract": "Many important endemic and emerging diseases are vector-borne. The functional traits of vectors affect not just pathogen transmission rates, but also the fitness and population dynamics of these animals themselves. Increasing empirical evidence suggests that vector traits vary significantly at time scales relevant to transmission dynamics. Currently, an understanding of how this variation in key traits impacts transmission is hindered by a lack of both empirical data and theoretical methods for mechanistically incorporating traits into transmission models. Here, we present a framework for incorporating both intrinsic and environment-driven variation in vector traits into empirical and theoretical vector-borne disease research. This framework mechanistically captures the effect of trait variation on vector fitness, the correlation between vector traits, and how these together determine transmission dynamics. We illustrate how trait-based vector-borne disease modelling can make novel predictions, and identify key steps and challenges in the construction, empirical parameterisation and validation of such models, as well as the organization and prioritization of data collection efforts.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia are obligate intracellular bacteria which commonly infect various nematode and arthropod species. Based on depth differences, we assembled the genome of Wolbachia in the parasitoid jewel wasp species Nasonia oneida (wOne), using 10X Genomics Chromium linked-read technology. The final draft assembly consists of 1,293,406 bp in 47 scaffolds with 1,114 coding genes and 97.01% genome completeness assessed by checkM. wOne is the A1 strain previously reported in N. oneida, and pyrosequencing confirms that the wasp strain lacks A2 and B types, which were likely lost during laboratory culturing. Polymorphisms identified in the wOneA1 genome have elevated read depths, indicating recent gene duplications rather that strain variation. These polymorphisms are enriched in nonsynonymous changes in 27 coding genes, including phase baseplate assembly proteins and transporter activity related genes. wOneA1 is more closely grouped with A-Wolbachia in the Drosophila simulans (wHa) than A-Wolbachia found in wasps. Genome variation was next evaluated in 34 published Wolbachia genomes for 211 single ortholog genes, and revealed six supergroup discordant trees, indicating recombination events not only between A and B supergroups, but also between A and E supergroups. Comparisons of strain divergence using the five genes of the Multi Locus Strain Typing (MLST) system show a high correlation (rho=0.98) between MLST and whole genome divergences, indicating that MLST is a reliable method for identifying related strains when whole genome data are not available. Assembling bacterial genomes from host genome projects can provide an effective method for sequencing Wolbachia genomes and characterizing their diversity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMore than half of the arthropod species are infected by the obligated intracellular bacteria Wolbachia. As one of the most widespread parasitic microbes, Wolbachia mediate important biological processes such as cytoplasmic incompatibility and lateral gene transfer in insects. Their evolutionary relationship has been characterize using five protein-coding and 16S rRNA genes. In this work, we identified 211 conserved single copies genes in 34 genome sequenced Wolbachia strains, and we discovered that they maintain the supergroup relationship classified previously based on selected genes. We constructed phylogenetic trees for individual genes and found only six genes display discordant tree structure between supergroups, due to lateral gene transfer and homologous recombination events. But these events are not common (3%) in Wolbachia genomes, at least in these conserved single copy genes. In addition to known lateral gene transfer events between A and B supergroups, we identified transfers between A and E supergroups for the first time. Selective maintenance of such transfers suggests possible roles in Wolbachia infection related functions. We also found enriched nonsynonymous polymorphisms in Nasonia oneida Wobachia genome, and their differences are more likely to result from gene duplications within the strain, rather than strain variation within the parasitoid.",

The aim of this study was to identify changepoints in a range of biomarkers during the preclinical phase of AD.\\n\\nMethodsWe examined nine measures based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive testing, obtained from 306 cognitively normal individuals, a subset of whom subsequently progressed to the symptomatic phase of AD. A changepoint model was used to determine which of the measures had a significant change in slope in relation to clinical symptom onset.\\n\\nResultsAll nine measures had significant changepoints, all of which preceded symptom onset, however the timing of these changepoints varied considerably. A single measure, CSF-tau, had an early changepoint (40 years prior to symptom onset). A group of measures, including the remaining CSF measures (CSF-Abeta and phosphorylated tau) and all cognitive tests had changepoints 10-15 years prior to symptom onset. A second group is formed by medial temporal lobe shape composite measures, with a five-year time difference between the right and left side (respectively nine and three years prior to symptom onset).\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings highlight the long period of time prior to symptom onset during which AD pathology is accumulating in the brain.

However, the genomic distribution of somatic L1Hs (Human-specific LINE-1) insertions and their potential impact on carrier cells remain unclear. Here, using a PCR-based targeted bulk sequencing approach, we profiled 9,181 somatic insertions from 20 postmortem tissues from five Rett patients and their matched healthy controls. We identified and validated somatic L1Hs insertions in both cortical neurons and non-brain tissues. In Rett patients, somatic insertions were significantly depleted in exons--mainly contributed by long genes--than healthy controls, implying that cells carrying MECP2 mutations might be defenseless against a second exonic L1Hs insertion. We observed a significant increase of somatic L1Hs insertions in the brain compared with non-brain tissues from the same individual. Compared to germline insertions, somatic insertions were less sense-depleted to transcripts, indicating that they underwent weaker selective pressure on the orientation of insertion. Our observations demonstrate that somatic L1Hs insertions contribute to genomic diversity and MECP2 dysfunction alters their genomic patterns in Rett patients.\n\nAuthor SummaryHuman-specific LINE-1 (L1Hs) is the most active autonomous retrotransposon family in the human genome. Mounting evidence supports that L1Hs retrotransposition occurs postzygotically in the human brain cells, contributing to neuronal genomic diversity, but the extent of L1Hs-driven mosaicism in the brain is debated. In this study, we profiled genome-wide L1Hs insertions among 20 postmortem tissues from Rett patients and matched controls. We identified and validated somatic L1Hs insertions in both cortical neurons and non-brain tissues, with a higher jumping activity in the brain.

    "abstract": "Measurements of nuclear organization in asymmetric nuclei in 2D images have traditionally been manual. This is exemplified by attempts to measure chromosome position in sperm samples, typically by dividing the nucleus into zones, and manually scoring which zone a FISH signal lies in. This is time consuming, limiting the number of nuclei that can be analyzed, and prone to subjectivity. We have developed a new approach for automated mapping of FISH signals in asymmetric nuclei, integrated into an existing image analysis tool for nuclear morphology. Automatic landmark detection defines equivalent structural regions in each nucleus, then dynamic warping of the FISH images to a common shape allows us to generate a composite of the signal within the entire cell population. Using this approach, we mapped the positions of the sex chromosomes and two autosomes in three mouse lineages (Mus musculus domesticus, Mus musculus musculus and Mus spretus). We found that in all three, chromosomes 11 and 19 tend to interact with each other, but are shielded from interactions with the sex chromosomes. This organization is conserved across 2 million years of mouse evolution.",

    "abstract": "Cortical responses to repeated presentations of a stimulus are variable. This variability is sensitive to experimental manipulations that are also known to engage divisive normalization: a widespread description of neural activity as the ratio of a numerator (the excitatory stimulus drive) and denominator (the normalization signal). Yet, we lack a framework to quantify the effects of normalization on response variability. We extended the standard normalization model, treating the numerator and denominator as stochastic quantities, and derived a method to infer the single-trial normalization strength, which cannot be measured directly. The model revealed a general reduction of response variability in macaque primary visual cortex for neurons that were more strongly normalized, and during trials in which normalization was inferred to be strong. This framework could enable a direct quantification of the impact of single-trial normalization on perceptual judgments, and can readily be applied to other sensory and non-sensory factors.",

    "abstract": "Balancing energy budgets is thought to be challenging for birds living in arid ecosystems because food supplies are low and unpredictable, and climatic conditions extreme. Thus, to ensure they obtain sufficient energy to fuel daily energetic budgets, birds may need to adjust their diets and become less selective (generalist) as conditions become harsher. To test this hypothesis, we used DNA metabarcoding to characterize both the prey availability and the dietary content of several conspecific populations of a semi- and arid-endemic insectivorous bird, the Karoo-scrub-robin (Cercotrichas coryphaeus) across a climatic gradient. Our results showed that Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Orthoptera, and Lepidoptera were the main prey. When accounting for their presence as available prey, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera were preferred in all regions, whereas robins avoided Orthoptera and Lepidoptera in all but the most arid region. Although the different populations live in regions that vary with regards to productivity and thermoregulatory demands, we found that the dietary niche breadth (Bs) of the three populations was intermediate to low, and did not differ significantly. As a whole, our findings show that regardless of environmental harshness these insectivores have similar dietary niches, suggesting that large dietary plasticity is fundamental for their survival in energy-depauperated ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Hybridisation and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) are two of the many naturally occurring evolutionary processes that contribute to variability in individual gene histories. However, distinguishing between hybridisation and ILS is challenging and these processes can lead to serious difficulties in inferring phylogenies. These processes have been invoked as a possible explanation for the evolution of the endangered golden langur and its sister species, the capped langur. Previous molecular studies have retrieved conflicting phylogenies, with mitochondrial tree grouping capped and golden langur (CG) lineage with a largely Indian genus Semnopithecus while nuclear markers supporting their affiliation with a Southeast Asian genus, Trachypithecus. However, as pointed by others, the use of nuclear copies of mitochondrial DNA in the above studies might have generated the discordance. Because of this discordance, the phylogenetic position of CG lineage has been much debated in recent times. In this study, we have used nine nuclear and eight mitochondrial markers in conjunction with coalescent based species tree approach to better understand the evolutionary origin of CG lineage. Concatenated nuclear as well as the mitochondrial dataset recovered congruent relationships where CG lineage was sister to Trachypithecus. However nuclear species tree estimated using different multispecies coalescent methods were incongruent with the above result, suggesting presence of ILS/hybridisation. Furthermore, CG lineage is morphologically intermediate between Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus with respect to skull and body measurements. Based on these evidences, we argue that CG lineage evolved through hybridisation between Semnopithecus and Trachypithecus. Taxonomic and conservation implications of these results are also discussed.",

We characterized the structural organization of dendrites in the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus by analyzing Sholl intersections, dendritic branches, branching and orientation angles of dendrites, and the different types of spine on the dendritic branches. Utilizing this quantitative imaging approach, we show that there are differences in the number of Sholl intersections and in the orientation of apical and basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons.

    "abstract": "In most environments, the visual system is confronted with many relevant objects simultaneously. That is especially true during reading. However, behavioral data demonstrate that a serial bottleneck prevents recognition of more than one word at a time. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how parallel spatial channels of visual processing converge into a serial bottleneck for word recognition. Observers viewed pairs of words presented simultaneously. We found that retinotopic cortex processed the two words in parallel spatial channels, one in each contralateral hemisphere. Responses were higher for attended words than ignored words, but were not reduced when attention was divided, even though behavioral performance suffered greatly. We then analyzed two word-selective regions along the occipito-temporal sulcus (OTS) of both hemispheres (i.e., sub-regions of visual word form area, VWFA). Unlike retinotopic cortex, each word-selective region responded to words on both sides of fixation. Nonetheless, a single region in the left hemisphere (VWFA-1 in posterior OTS) contained spatial channels for both hemifields that were independently modulated by selective attention. Thus, the left posterior VWFA supports parallel processing of multiple words. In contrast, a more anterior word-selective region in the left hemisphere (VWFA-2 in mid-OTS) showed limited spatial and attentional selectivity, consistent with activity of a single channel. Therefore, the visual system can process two words in parallel up to a late stage in the ventral stream. The transition from two parallel channels to a single channel in more anterior regions is consistent with the observed bottleneck in behavior.",

    "abstract": "A differentially methylated region (DMR) is a genomic region in which DNA methylation is consistently positively or negatively associated with a phenotype or exposure. We demonstrate that existing algorithms for identifying DMRs either fail to consistently control false positive rates (comb-p and DMRcate), suffer from low power (bumphunter) or lack modeling flexibility (seqlm). We introduce a new method, dmrff, that overcomes these shortcomings and can additionally be used to meta-analyze multiple datasets. When applied to investigate associations of age in multiple datasets, dmrff identifies novel DMRs near genes previously linked to age. An R implementation is available on Github (http://github.com/perishky/dmrff).",

    "abstract": "Large-scale exome sequencing of tumors has enabled the identification of cancer drivers using recurrence and clustering-based approaches. Some of these methods also employ three-dimensional protein structures to identify mutational hotspots in cancer-associated genes. In determining such mutational clusters in structures, existing approaches overlook protein dynamics, despite the essential role of dynamics in protein functionality. In this work, we present a framework to identify driver genes using a dynamics-based search of mutational hotspot communities. After partitioning 3D structures into distinct communities of residues using anisotropic network models, we map variants onto the partitioned structures. We then search for signals of positive selection among these residue communities to identify putative drivers. We applied our method using the TCGA pan-cancer atlas missense mutation catalog. Overall, our analyses predict one or more mutational hotspots within the resolved structures of 434 genes. Ontological and pathway enrichment analyses implicate genes with predicted hotspots to be enriched in biological processes associated with tumor progression. Additionally, a comparison between our approach and existing hotspot detection methods that use structural data suggests that the inclusion of dynamics significantly increases the sensitivity of driver detection.",

    "abstract": "Loners, individuals out-of-sync with a coordinated majority, occur frequently in nature. Are loners incidental byproducts of large-scale synchronization attempts or are they part of a mosaic of life-history strategies? Here, we provide the first empirical evidence of naturally occurring heritable variation in loner behavior, using the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Moreover, we show that Dictyostelium loners--cells that do not join the multicellular life-stage-- result from a dynamic population-partitioning process. Underlying this partitioning, we find evidence that each cell makes a stochastic, signal-based decision resulting in an imperfectly synchronized multicellular development affected by both abiotic (environmental porosity) and biotic (strain-specific signaling) factors. Finally, we predict that when strains differing in their partitioning behavior co-occur, cross-signaling impacts slime-mold diversity across spatio-temporal scales. Loners are therefore critical to understanding collective and social behaviors, multicellular development, and ecological dynamics in D. discoideum. More broadly, across taxa, imperfect synchronization might be adaptive by enabling diversification of life-history strategies.",

    "abstract": "The classic picture of flagellum biosynthesis in E. coli, inferred from population measurements, describes a tightly controlled, deterministic transcriptional program. In individual E. coli cells, we discover that flagellar promoters are in fact stochastically activated in pulses. Such pulses comprise coordinated  on and  off states of promoter activity, each of which can span multiple generations. We demonstrate that this pulsing program obeys the regulatory logic of flagellar assembly, which dictates whether some promoters skip pulses. Remarkably, pulses in this transcriptional network appear to be actually governed by a post-translational circuit. Our results suggest that even topologically simple transcriptional networks can generate unexpectedly rich temporal dynamics and phenotypic heterogeneities.",

To determine the mechanism of action of KBP-7072 and understand how its unique C9 extension can be used to combat the growing problem of antibiotic resistance we determined the structure of KBP-7072 bound to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, the inhibitory target of typical tetracyclines. We show that KBP-7072 binds to the primary tetracycline binding site on the 30S ribosomal subunit consistent with it acting as a protein synthesis inhibitor that blocks A-site occupation. Moreover, the unique chemical nature of KBP-7072{acute}s C9 extension leads to a distinctive interaction pattern with the 30S subunit that distinguishes KBP-7072 from the third-generation tetracycline, Tigecycline, and thus expands the interaction potential of the primary tetracycline binding pocket.",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human tumor virus and a model of herpesviral latency. The virus efficiently infects resting human B-lymphocytes and induces their continuous proliferation in vitro, which mimics certain aspects of EBVs oncogenic potential in vivo. This seminal finding was made 50 years ago, but how EBV activates primary human B-lymphocytes and how lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) evolve from the EBV-infected lymphocytes is uncertain. We conducted a systematic time-resolved longitudinal study of cellular functions and transcriptional profiles of newly infected naive primary B-lymphocytes. EBV reprograms these human cells comprehensively and globally. Rapid and extensive transcriptional changes occur within 24 hours of infection and precede any metabolic and phenotypic changes. Within the next 48 hours, the virus activates the cells, changes their phenotypes with respect to cell size, RNA and protein content and induces metabolic pathways to cope with the increased demand for energy, supporting an efficient cell cycle entry on day three post infection. The transcriptional program that EBV initiates consists of three waves of clearly discernable clusters of cellular genes that peak on day one, two, or three and regulate RNA synthesis, metabolic pathways and cell division, respectively. Upon the onset of cell doublings on day four the cellular transcriptome appears to be completely reprogrammed to support the activated and proliferating cell, but three additional clusters of EBV regulated genes adjust the infected immune cells to fine-tune cell signaling, migration, and immune response pathways, eventually. Our study reveals that more than 98 % of the 13,000 expressed genes in B-lymphocytes are regulated upon infection demonstrating that EBV governs the entire biology of its target cell.",

However, the role of these specific TFs in the regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS), which is a proven therapeutic vulnerability for cancers driven by the TF MYC, is not described. Using transcriptomic datasets from PCa patients, we tested for an association between expression of FOXA1, ERG, AR, HOXB13, and MYC, and genes involved in AS - termed splicing-related proteins (SRPs), which have pleiotropic roles in RNA metabolism. We identified FOXA1 as the strongest predictor of dysregulated SRP gene expression, which was associated with PCa disease relapse after treatment. Subsequently, we selected a subset of FOXA1-binding and actively-transcribed SRP genes that phenocopy the FOXA1 dependency of PCa cells, and confirmed in vitro via knockdown and over-expression that FOXA1 regulates SRP gene expression. Finally, we demonstrated the persistence of a FOXA1-SRP gene association in treatment-relapsed castration-resistant PCa (CRPCa) patients. Our data demonstrate, for the first time, that FOXA1 controls dysregulated SRP gene expression, which is associated with poor PCa patient outcomes. Analogous to MYC-driven cancers, our findings implicate the therapeutic targeting of SRPs and AS in FOXA1-overexpressing PCa.",

    "abstract": "The gene encoding the Duffy blood group protein (Fy, CD234; additional designations Duffy Antigen Receptor of Chemokines [DARC] and Atypical Chemokine Receptor 1 [ACKR1]) is characterized by a SNP in a GATA-1 transcription factor binding site associated with the erythrocyte silent (ES) phenotype. FYES homozygous people are viewed to be highly resistant to blood stage infection with Plasmodium vivax. Increasingly, however, studies are reporting P. vivax infections in Fy-negative individuals across malarious African countries where FYES approaches genetic fixation. This suggests that P. vivax has evolved a Fy-independent RBC invasion pathway, or that the GATA-1 SNP does not abolish Fy expression. Here, we tested the second hypothesis through binding studies to erythroid lineage cells using recombinant P. vivax Duffy binding protein, the parasites invasion ligand and Fy6-specific antibodies. We first observed variable Fy expression on circulating RBCs, irrespective of FY genotype; FYES RBCs were periodically Fy-positive. Furthermore, during the in vitro erythroid differentiation of CD34+ cells and on ex vivo bone marrow samples, we observed Fy expression on erythroid precursor cells from FYES people. Finally, the Fy6-specific nanobody, CA111 was used to capture Fy from the surface of FYES RBCs. Our findings reveal that the GATA-1 SNP does not fully abolish Fy expression and provide insight on potential susceptibility of Fy-negative people to vivax malaria.\\n\\nSignificanceDuffy blood group negativity results from a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene promoter, and reaches genetic fixation in many African ethnicities. Because the Duffy protein (Fy) is an important contact point during Plasmodium vivax human red blood cell invasion, Fy-negativity is considered to confer resistance to P. vivax malaria. With recent studies in African countries reporting P. vivax infection in Fy-negative people, we studied Fy expression across erythroid development. Here we report that the FY promoter SNP does not abolish Fy protein expression in erythroid progenitors developing in the bone marrow. These results further emphasizes the importance of reticulocytes as targets for P. vivax blood stage infection and propose a mechanism for P. vivax infections in Fy-negative people.",

There was also a pronounced synergy between the cholinergic and glutamatergic modulation of the plateau potentials.\n\nOur findings provide insights into how OLM cells are modulated by different neurotransmitters, and are likely to have functional implications on how OLM cells regulate hippocampal information processing during different brain states.",

However, not all neurological, intellectual disability and comorbid phenotypes in SeSAME syndrome can be mechanistically linked solely to Kir4.1 dysfunction. We therefore performed whole exome sequencing and identified additional genetic risk-elements that might exert causative effects either alone or in concert with Kir4.1 in a family diagnosed with SeSAME syndrome. Two variant prioritization pipelines based on AR inheritance and runs of homozygosity (ROH), identified two novel homozygous variants in KCNJ10 and PI4KB and five rare homozygous variants in PVRL4, RORC, FLG2, FCRL1, NIT1 and one common homozygous variant in HSPA6 segregating in all four patients. The novel mutation in KCNJ10 resides in the cytoplasmic domain of Kir4.1, a seat of phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate (PIP2) binding. The mutation altered the subcellular localization and stability of Kir4.1 in patient-specific lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) compared to parental controls. Barium-sensitive endogenous K+ currents in patient-specific LCLs using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology revealed membrane depolarization and defects in inward K+ ion conductance across the membrane, thereby suggesting a loss-of-function effect of KCNJ10 variant. Altogether our findings implicate the role of new genes in SeSAME syndrome without electrolyte imbalance and thereby speculate the regulation of Kir4.1 channel activity by PIP2 and integrin-mediated adhesion signaling mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "In light of the marked differences in the intrinsic biological underpinnings and prognostic outcomes among different subtypes, Consensus Molecular Subtype (CMS) classification provides a new taxonomy of colorectal cancer (CRC) solely based on transcriptomics data and has been accepted as a standard rule for CRC stratification. Even though CMS was built on highly cancer relevant features, it suffers from limitations in capturing the promiscuous mechanisms in a clinical setting. There are at least two facts about using transcriptomic data for prognosis prediction: the engagement of genes or pathways that execute the clinical response pathway are highly dynamic and interactive with others; and a predefined patient stratification not only largely decrease the statistical analysis power, but also excludes the fact that clusters of patients that confer similar clinical outcomes may or may not overlap with a pre-defined subgrouping. To enable a flexible and prospective stratified exploration, we here present a novel computational framework based on bi-clustering aiming to identify gene regulatory mechanisms associated with various biological, clinical and drug-resistance features, with full recognition of the transiency of transcriptional regulation and complicacies of patients subgrouping with regards to different biological and clinical settings. Our analysis on multiple large scale CRC transcriptomics data sets using a bi-clustering based formulation suggests that the detected local low rank modules can not only generate new biological understanding coherent to CMS stratification, but also identify predictive markers for prognosis that are general to CRC or CMS dependent, as well as novel alternative drug resistance mechanisms. Our key results include: (1) a comprehensive annotation of the local low rank module landscape of CRC; (2) a mechanistic relationship between different clinical subtypes and outcomes, as well as their characteristic biological underpinnings, visible through a novel consensus map; and (3) a few (novel) resistance mechanisms of Oxaliplatin, 5-Fluorouracil, and the FOLFOX therapy are revealed, some of which are validated on independent datasets.",

    "abstract": "Due to its completeness, the A.L. 288-1 (\u201cLucy\u201d) skeleton has long served as the archetypal bipedal Australopithecus. However, there remains considerable debate about its limb proportions. There are three competing, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, explanations for the high humerofemoral index of A.L. 288-1: (1) a retention of proportions from an Ardipithecus-like most recent common ancestor (MRCA); (2) indication of some degree of climbing ability; (3) allometry. Recent discoveries of other partial skeletons of Australopithecus, such as those of A. sediba (MH1 and MH2) and A. afarensis (KSD-VP-1/1 and DIK-1/1), have provided new opportunities to test hypotheses of early hominin body size and limb proportions. Yet, no early hominin is as complete (&gt;90%), as is the ~3.67 Ma \u201cLittle Foot\u201d (StW 573) specimen, from Sterkfontein Member 2. Here, we provide the first descriptions of that skeleton\u2019s upper and lower long limb bones, as well as a comparative context of its limb proportions. As to the latter, we found that StW 573 possesses absolutely longer limb lengths than A.L. 288-1, but both skeletons show similar limb proportions. This finding seems to argue against a purely allometric explanation for A.L. 288-1\u2019s limb proportions. In fact, our multivariate allometric analysis suggests that limb lengths of Australopithecus, as represented by StW 573 and A.L. 288-1, developed along a significantly different (p &lt; 0.001) allometric scale than that which typifies modern humans and African apes. Our analyses also suggest, as have those of others, that hominin limb evolution occurred in two stages with: (1) a modest increase in lower limb length and a concurrent shortening of the antebrachium between Ardipithecus and Australopithecus, followed by (2) considerable lengthening of the lower limb along with a decrease of both upper limb elements occurring between Australopithecus and Homo sapiens.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Predation exerts one of the greatest selective pressures on prey organisms. Many studies showed the existence of innate anti-predator responses mostly in early stages of juveniles vertebrate. Learning is also possible but risky since it can cause death. There is now growing evidence that embryonic learning exists in animals but few studies have tested explicitly for learning in embryos. Here, Sepia pharaonis cuttlefish embryos respond to the presence or odour of a predator fish but not to a non-predator fish. Interestingly, embryos can learn to associate a non-threatening stimulus with an alarm signal: cuttlefish ink. After several paired exposures, they respond to the harmless fish as if it were dangerous. Our results demonstrate both innate and acquired predator recognition in a cephalopod. Embryos response is a decrease of ventilation rate. Such response is adaptive, especially in a translucent egg, since it reduces movement and hence the risk of being detected; this freezing-like behaviour may also reduce bioelectric field, which lessens shark predation risk. Last, our result is the first report of associative learning in an invertebrate embryo. This shows that a cuttlefish embryo can have both genetic predator avoidance skills and possesses enough cognitive abilities plasticity to learn and retain new threats before hatching. The combination of these mechanisms is an impressive example of the early adaptability of cephalopod molluscs. This amount of behavioural plasticity gives the newly-hatched sepia a huge selective advantage when dealing with known or new threats.",

    "abstract": "Background and ObjectivesThere is increasing evidence that frequent blood donation depletes the iron stores of some blood donors. The FinDonor 10 000 study was set up to study iron status and factors affecting iron stores in Finnish blood donors. In Finland, iron supplementation for at-risk groups has been in place since the 1980s.\n\nMaterial and Methods2584 blood donors (N= 8003 samples) were recruited into the study alongside the standard donation at three donation sites in the capital region of Finland between 5/2015 and 12/2017. All participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire about their health and lifestyle. Blood samples were collected from the sample pouch of whole blood collection set, kept in cool temperature and processed centrally. Whole blood count, CRP, ferritin and sTFR were measured from the samples and DNA was isolated for GWAS studies.\n\nResultsParticipant demographics, albeit in general similar to the general blood donor population in Finland, indicated some bias toward older and more frequent donors. Participation in the study increased median donation frequency of the donors. Analysis of the effect of time lag from the sampling to the analysis and the time of day when sample was drawn revealed small but significant time-dependent changes.\n\nConclusionThe FinDonor cohort now provides us with tools to identify potential donor groups at increased risk of iron deficiency as factors explaining this risk. The increase in donation frequency during the study suggests that scientific projects can be used to increase the commitment of blood donors.",

In multivariable linear regression analyses, significant clinical determinants of dyspnea were [{beta} (95% confidence interval)]: psychiatric illness [-20.8 (-32.4, -9.09) for No/Yes], heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [-15.5 (-28.0, -2.97) for No/Yes], and forced expiratory volume in 1 second [-0.28 (-0.49, -0.06) for each % predicted]. Dyspnea was an independent predictor of functional EC [-1.54 (-2.43, -0.64) for each point]. These results were similar with the SOBQ.\\n\\nConclusionWe identified clinical determinants of dyspnea which have pathophysiological bases. Dyspnea was independently associated with functional EC. Behavioral interventions to promote exercise in lung cancer survivors following curative-intent therapy may need to also optimize medical therapy for cardiopulmonary and/or psychiatric disease and reduce dyspnea to be effective.",

    "abstract": "The global geometrical arrangement of face parts (eyes over nose over mouth), commonly referred to as first order configural (FOC) properties, is believed to constitute a fundamental aspect of face detection. Indeed, several brain regions in the face processing network have been shown to display increased activity in response to abstract stimuli for face-like as compared to random spatial arrangements. However, the absence of a mathematical formalization of FOC properties makes it difficult to systematically study their contribution to face perception. To fill this gap, we used analytical geometry to define a set of 19 FOC features. In two psychophysical studies, a 2-alternative forced choice task assessing difference in perceived faceness between two stimuli and a Likert test assessing measuring perceived faceness of individual stimuli, we evaluated the contribution of each feature to the perceived faceness of abstract stimuli consisting of four black rectangular shapes reflecting the two eyes, the nose and the mouth. From the two experiments two subsets of features relevant for face detection were selected, including 10 and 11 features, respectively. Interestingly, 7 features are shared between the two sets. The difference between the subsets reflects processing of individual FOC features in the first study and holistic processing in the second study. The partial superimposition, on the other hand, is reflective of a shared basic mechanism in the perception of first order configural properties.",

    "abstract": "How does the size of a neural circuit influence its learning performance? Intuitively, we expect the learning capacity of a neural circuit to grow with the number of neurons and synapses. Larger brains tend to be found in species with higher cognitive function and learning ability. Similarly, adding connections and units to artificial neural networks can allow them to solve more complex tasks. However, we show that in a biologically relevant setting where synapses introduce an unavoidable amount of noise, there is an optimal size of network for a given task. Beneath this optimal size, our analysis shows how adding apparently redundant neurons and connections can make tasks more learnable. Therefore large neural circuits can either devote connectivity to generating complex behaviors, or exploit this connectivity to achieve faster and more precise learning of simpler behaviors. Above the optimal network size, the addition of neurons and synaptic connections starts to impede learning performance. This suggests that overall brain size may be constrained by the need to learn efficiently with unreliable synapses, and may explain why some neurological learning deficits are associated with hyperconnectivity. Our analysis is independent of specific learning rules and uncovers fundamental relationships between learning rate, task performance, network size and intrinsic noise in neural circuits.",

    "abstract": "Increasing population, rapid urbanization and climate change have immensely affected the freshwater sources around the world. The continuous decline in the number of natural potable water sources raises serious concern about the overall health of the human population. Developing countries are the most affected in this regard due to lack of proper hygienic maintenance protocols. Sikkim an Eastern Himalayan state with mountains as predominant topological features, harbors several natural spring water (SW). These spring waters are the primary source of potable water for the population in the four districts of the state viz. East (E), West (W), South (S) and North (N). Several incidences of water-borne diseases and the relative lack of scientific evaluation reports on the water quality of the area have educed this study. Lack of any standard filtration and purification practice among the population is one of the prime factors for the outspread of different waterborne pathogen in the state. The people of the state mostly use boiling as a dominant method of water purification, while only a small percentage of people in the West district were found to use modern standard purification system (W = 30%). The rainy season was found to be the major contributor of different diseases (E = 86%; W=100%; S=100%; N=80%) and statistical analysis of the fecal coliforms of the different season also indicated a significant difference at p < 0.05. There was no statistical significance among the physicochemical parameter of the SW but surprisingly the water from the four districts was recorded with traces of highly toxic heavy metals like mercury/WHO limit (0.001-0.007mg/l/0.001) as well as lead/WHO limit (0.001-0.007mg/l/0.05) and selenium/WHO limit (0.526-0.644 mg/l/0.01) which was above the WHO permissible limit. Piper analysis showed that water was dominated by cation sodium ion (Na+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) anion and the water can be categorized as Mg-HCO3- type. Pairwise Pearson correlation showed a significant correlation between Electrical conductivity and TDS (r = 0.998/1.00) as well as alkalinity and turbidity (0.993/1.00). The microbial confirmatory test showed severity in fecal contamination with high counts of Total Coliform (TC), Escherichia coli (EC) and Enterococcus (EN). Highest TC was recorded from W (37.26/ml) and lowest in N (22.13/ ml) in spring water. Highest contamination of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus was found in E (EC = 8.7/ml; EN = 2.08/ml) followed by S (EC = 8.4/ml and EN = 2.05/ml). It was found that community reservoir (CR) tank was more contaminated than SP, which indicates the negligence in maintenance and fecal contamination during transportation to the reservoir. Though household water was least contaminated compared to CR and SP, but it fails in WHO standard criteria for drinking water. These results indicate an immediate health risk of the resident of the state and which needs to be taken care of sooner as possible by protecting the important potable sources with required policies and regulations.",

    "abstract": "Language production ultimately aims to convey meaning. Yet, words differ widely in the richness and density of their semantic representations and these differences impact conceptual and lexical processes during speech planning. Here, we replicate the recent finding that semantic richness, measured as the number of associated semantic features according to semantic feature production norms, facilitates object naming. In contrast, intercorrelational semantic feature density, measured as the degree of intercorrelation of a concepts features, presumably resulting in the coactivation of closely related concepts, has an inhibitory influence. We replicate the behavioral effects and investigate their relative time course and electrophysiological correlates. Both the facilitatory effect of high semantic richness and the inhibitory influence of high feature density were reflected in an increased posterior positivity starting at about 250 ms, in line with previous reports of posterior positivities in paradigms employing contextual manipulations to induce semantic interference during language production. Furthermore, amplitudes at the same posterior electrode sites were positively correlated with object naming times between about 230 and 380 ms. The observed effects follow naturally from the assumption of conceptual facilitation and simultaneous lexical competition, and are difficult to explain by language production theories dismissing lexical competition.",

    "abstract": "Context effects have been explained by either high-level cognitive processes or low-level neural adjustments but not their combination. It is currently unclear how these processes interact to shape individuals responses to context. Here, we used a large cohort of human subjects in experiments involving choice between two or three gambles in order to study the dependence of context effects on neural adaptation and individuals risk attitudes. We found no evidence that neural adaptation on long timescales (~100 trials) contributes to context effects. However, we identified two groups of subjects with distinct patterns of responses to decoys, both of which depended on individuals risk aversion. Subjects in the first group exhibited strong, consistent decoy effects and became more risk averse due to decoy presentation. In contrast, subjects in the second group did not show consistent decoy effects and became more risk seeking. The degree of change in risk aversion due to decoy presentation was positively correlated with the initial degrees of risk aversion. To explain these results and reveal underlying neural mechanisms, we developed a new model that incorporates both low- and high-level processes to fit individuals choice behavior. We found that observed decoy effects can be explained by a combination of adjustments in neural representations and competitive weighting of reward attributes, both of which depend on risk aversion but in opposite directions. Altogether, our results demonstrate how a combination of low- and high-level processes shapes multi-attribute choice, modulates overall risk preference, and explains distinct behavioral phenotypes.\n\nSignificance statementA large body of experimental work has illustrated that the introduction of a new, and often irrelevant, option can influence preference among the existing options, a phenomenon referred to as context or decoy effects. Although context effects have been explained by high-level cognitive processes--such as comparisons and competitions between attributes--or low-level adjustments of neural representations, it is unclear how these processes interact to shape individuals responses to context. Here, we show that both high-level cognitive processes and low-level neural adjustments shift risk preference during choice between multiple options but in opposite directions. Moreover, we demonstrate that a combination of these processes can account for distinct patterns of context effects in human subjects.",

    "abstract": "Segmenting the continuous speech stream into units for further perceptual and linguistic analyses is fundamental to speech recognition. The speech amplitude envelope (SE) has long been considered a fundamental temporal cue for segmenting speech. Does the temporal fine structure (TFS), a significant part of speech signals often considered to contain primarily spectral information, contribute to speech segmentation? Using magnetoencephalography, we show that the TFS entrains cortical oscillatory responses between 3-6 Hz and demonstrate, using mutual information analysis, that (i) the temporal information in the TFS can be reconstructed from a measure of frame-to-frame spectral change and correlates with the SE and (ii) that spectral resolution is key to the extraction of such temporal information. Furthermore, we show behavioural evidence that, when the SE is temporally distorted, the TFS provides cues for speech segmentation and aids speech recognition significantly. Our findings show that it is insufficient to investigate solely the SE to understand temporal speech segmentation, as the SE and the TFS derived from a band-filtering method convey comparable, if not inseparable, temporal information. We argue for a more synthetic view of speech segmentation - the auditory system groups speech signals coherently in both temporal and spectral domains.",

Preemptive identification of patients at risk of opioid dependence and developing intelligent clinical decisions to deprescribe opioids to the vulnerable patient population may help in reducing the burden. Identifying patients susceptible to mortality due to opioid-induced side effects and understanding the landscape of drug-drug interaction pairs aggravating opioid usage are significant, yet, unexplored research questions. In this study, we present a collection of predictive models to identify patients at risk of opioid abuse, mortality and drug-drug interactions in the context of opioid usage. Using publicly available dataset from MIMIC-III, we developed predictive models (opioid abuse models a=Logistic Regression; b=Extreme Gradient Boosting and mortality model= Extreme Gradient Boosting) and identified potential drug-drug interaction patterns. To enable the translational value of our work, the predictive model and all associated software code is provided.

Cestode platyhelminth hooks and swellings by entoniscid isopods may be recognized in the future. Relative to 2014, we report an increase of 41% to 124 fossil decapod species with epicaridean-induced swellings in the branchial chamber (ichnotaxon Kanthyloma crusta). Furthermore, using a Late Jurassic (Tithonian) decapod assemblage from Austria, we find (1) no correlation between genus abundance and prevalence of K. crusta, (2) host preference for some galatheoid taxa (as for a mid-Cretaceous assemblage from Spain), and (3) a larger median size of parasitized versus non-parasitized specimens for two selected species. The latter result may be caused by infestation throughout ontogeny rather than exclusively in juveniles and/or possible selection for the larger sex.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The recruitment of leukocytes from blood vessels to inflamed zones is guided by biochemical and mechanical stimuli, with mechanisms only partially deciphered. We studied here the guidance by flow of primary human effector T lymphocytes crawling on substrates coated with ligands of integrins LFA-1 (L{beta}2) and VLA-4 (4{beta}1), and showed that cells segregated in two populations of opposite orientation for combined adhesion. Sharp decisions of orientation were shown to rely on a bistable mechanism between LFA-1-mediated upstream and VLA-4-dominant downstream phenotypes. At the molecular level, bistability results from a differential front-rear polarization of both integrins affinity, combined with an inhibiting crosstalk of LFA-1 toward VLA-4. At the cellular level, directivity with or against the flow is mechanically mediated by the passive orientation of detached uropod or lamellipod by flow. This complete chain of logical events provides a unique mechanistic picture of a guiding mechanism, from stimuli to cell orientation.\\n\\nSignificanceCellular guidance is crucial to many biological functions, but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. We have analyzed here an original phenotype of flow-guided cells mimicking leukocytes crawling into the blood vessels and showed that the controlling parameter of cells decision to migrate upstream or downstream was the relative number of two specific adhesion molecules, the integrins LFA-1 and VLA-4. The spatial polarisation of integrins affinity and an intermutually feedback of their activation create a bistable system where cells adhere either by their tip or their tail and orient respectively downstream or upstream. This mechanism therefore proposes a complete chain of event from stimuli to cell orientation and differs strongly from the chemotaxis paradigm because stimuli trigger no signaling.",

    "abstract": "Platelet integrin lIb{beta}3 plays a critical role in both hemostasis and thrombosis. Current IIb{beta}3 antagonists are potent anti-thrombotic drugs, but also cause adverse outcomes, which limited their clinical use. Drug-induced serious bleeding, thrombocytopenia and paradoxical thrombosis have been linked to impaired clot retraction and to conformational changes in IIb{beta}3 that promote binding of preformed antibodies, natural ligands or both to IIb{beta}3. We have used structure-guided design to generate the orthosteric inhibitor Hr10 that acts as a pure IIb{beta}3 antagonist, i.e. it does not induce the conformational changes in IIb{beta}3. Hr10 is as effective as the partial agonist drug eptifibatide in blocking platelet aggregation and arteriolar thrombosis in mice. In contrast to eptifibatide, however, Hr10 preserved thrombin-induced clot retraction, suggesting that it may not perturb hemostasis. Our structure-based approach can find general utility in designing pure orthosteric inhibitors for other integrins, in providing vital tools for dissecting structure-activity relationships in IIb{beta}3, and potentially in offering safer alternatives for human therapy.",

    "abstract": "Polypyrimidine tract-binding proteins (PTBPs) are RNA binding proteins that regulate a number of post-transcriptional events. Human PTBP1 transits between the nucleus and cytoplasm and is thought to regulate RNA processes in both. However, information about PTBP1 mRNA isoforms and regulation of PTPB1 expression remain incomplete. Here we mapped the major PTBP1 mRNA isoforms in HEK293T cells, and identified alternative 5 and 3untranslated regions (5 UTRs, 3 UTRs) as well as alternative splicing patterns in the protein coding region. We also assessed how the observed PTBP1 mRNA isoforms contribute to PTBP1 expression in different phases of the cell cycle. Previously, PTBP1 mRNAs were shown to crosslink to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3). We find that eIF3 binds differently to each PTBP1 mRNA isoform in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We also observe a strong correlation between eIF3 binding to PTBP1 mRNAs and repression of PTBP1 levels during the S phase of the cell cycle. Our results provide evidence of translational regulation of PTBP1 protein levels during the cell cycle, which may affect downstream regulation of alternative splicing and translation mediated by PTBP1 protein isoforms.",

    "abstract": "INF2 is a member of the formin family of actin assembly factors. Dominant mis-sense mutations in INF2 link to two diseases: focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a kidney disease; and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTD), a neuropathy. All disease mutations map to the autoinhibitory Diaphanous Inhibitory Domain (DID). Curiously, purified INF2 is not autoinhibited, suggesting the existence of additional cellular inhibitors. We purified an INF2 inhibitor from mouse brain, and identified it as a complex between lysine-acetylated actin (KAc-actin) and cyclase-associated protein (CAP). Inhibition of INF2 by CAP/KAc-actin requires INF2 DID. Treatment of CAP/KAc-actin with histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) releases INF2 inhibition, while HDAC6 inhibitors block cellular INF2 activation. INF2 disease mutants are poorly inhibited by CAP/KAc-actin, suggesting that FSGS and CMTD result from reduced CAP/KAc-actin binding. This is the first demonstrated role for lysine-acetylated actin: regulation of an actin assembly factor by a novel mechanism, which we call facilitated auto-inhibition.",

Here, we present a comprehensive extracellular RNA (exRNA) study in human blood circulation based on conventional small RNA-sequencing (sRNA-seq) and sRNA-seq after T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) end-treatment of total exRNA isolated from serum and platelet-poor EDTA, ACD, and heparin plasma. Applying strict criteria for read mapping and annotation, we found that compared to conventional sRNA-seq PNK-treatment increased the detection of informative ex-mRNAs reads up to 50-fold. Based on captured ex-mRNAs from healthy individuals, we concluded that the exRNA pool is dominated by hematopoietic cells and platelets, with additional contribution from the liver. About 60% of the 15- to 42-nt long reads originated from the coding sequences, in a pattern reminiscent of ribosome-profiling studies for high abundance transcripts. Blood sample type had a considerable influence on the exRNA profile. The number of detected distinct ex-mRNA transcripts ranged from on average ~350 to 1100 in the different plasma types. In serum, additional transcripts from neutrophils and hematopoietic cells increased this number to ~2300. For EDTA and ACD, in particular, we found evidence of destabilization of mRNA and non-coding RNA ribonucleoprotein complexes. In a proof-of-concept study, we compared patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to healthy controls. The improved tissue resolution of ex-mRNAs after PNK-treatment enabled us to detect a neutrophil-signature in ACS that escaped detection in an ex-miRNA analysis. Thus, ex-mRNAs provide superior resolution for the study of exRNA changes in vivo and ex vivo. They can be readily studied by sRNA-seq after T4 PNK end-treatment.",

Later stages of disease can be explored through analyzing multiple samples collected longitudinally, on or between successive treatments, and finally at time of autopsy. It is also possible to study earlier stages of cancer development through probabilistic reconstruction of developmental trajectories based on mutational information preserved in the genome. Here we present a suite of tools, called Phylogic N-Dimensional with Timing (PhylogicNDT), that statistically model phylogenetic and evolutionary trajectories based on mutation and copy-number data representing samples taken at single or multiple time points. PhylogicNDT can be used to infer: (i) the order of clonal driver events (including in pre-cancerous stages); (ii) subclonal populations of cells and their phylogenetic relationships; and (iii) cell population dynamics. We demonstrate the use of PhylogicNDT by applying it to whole-exome and whole-genome data of 498 lung adenocarcinoma samples (434 previously available and 64 of newly generated data). We identify significantly different progression trajectories across subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma (EGFR mutant, KRAS mutant, fusion-driven and EGFR/KRAS wild type cancers). In addition, we study the progression of fusion-driven lung cancer in 21 patients by analyzing samples from multiple timepoints during treatment with 1st and next generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We characterize their subclonal diversification, dynamics, selection, and changes in mutational signatures and neoantigen load.

Existing technologies allow interrogation of neuronal circuits by both read and write activity, albeit with inherent limitations. Here, we present the development of bioluminescent multi-characteristic opsin (bMCO-11), which is comprised of a highly photosensitive ambient light-activatable domain and a Ca2+-sensitive bioluminescence reporter. The high quantum efficiency of bMCO-11 enables light activation and recording of cellular activity upon local as well as wide area optical stimulation. Furthermore, persistent Ca2+ influx was achieved by bioluminescence based cyclic activation of the opsin-domain of bMCO-11 by transporting the ions only into bMCO expressing cells. This allowed us to continuously monitor visual cortical activity in wild type and retinal degenerated mice, without requiring any additional external excitation source.",

    "abstract": "The concept of brain states, functionally relevant large-scale activity patterns, has become popular in neuroimaging. Not all components of such patterns are equally characteristic for each brain state, but machine learning provides a possibility for extracting and comparing the structure of brain states from functional data. However, their characterization in terms of functional connectivity measures varies widely, from cross-correlation to phase coherence, and the idea that different measures provide similar or coherent information is a common assumption made in neuroimaging. Here, we compare the brain state signatures extracted from of phase coherence, pairwise covariance, correlation, regularized covariance and regularized precision for a dataset of subjects performing five different cognitive tasks. In addition, we compare the classification performance in identifying the tasks for each connectivity measure. The measures are evaluated in their ability to discriminate the five tasks with two types of cross-validation: within-subject cross-validation, which reflects the stability of the signature over time; and between-subject cross-validation, which aims at extracting signatures that generalize across subjects. Secondly, we compare the informative features (connections or links between brain regions/areas) across measures to test the assumption that similar information is obtained about brain state signatures from different connectivity measures. In our results, the different types of cross-validation give different classification performance and emphasize that functional connectivity measures on fMRI require observation windows of sufficient duration. Furthermore, we find that informative links for the classification, meaning changes between tasks that are consistent across subjects, are entirely uncorrelated between BOLD correlations and covariances. These results indicate that the corresponding FC signature can strongly differ across FC methods used and that interpretation is subject to caution in terms of subnetworks related to a task.",

Models based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) achieve a quality of fit that surpasses that of commonly-used linear forward and backward models. Here, we show that their performance can be further improved using several techniques that capture the time-varying and context-dependent relationships within the data, including adaptive beamforming, CCA weight optimization, and recurrent neural networks that capture the time-varying and context-dependent relationships within the data. We demonstrate these results using a match-vs-mismatch classification paradigm, in which the classifier must decide which of two stimulus samples produced a given EEG response and which is a randomly chosen stimulus sample. This task captures the essential features of the more complex auditory attention decoding (AAD) task explored in many other studies.",

To capture synaptic vesicle exocytosis at cultured mouse hippocampal synapses, we induced single action potentials by electrical field stimulation then subjected neurons to high-pressure freezing to examine their morphology by electron microscopy. During synchronous release, multiple vesicles can fuse at a single active zone; this multivesicular release is augmented by increasing extracellular calcium. Fusions during synchronous release are distributed throughout the active zone, whereas fusions during asynchronous release are biased toward the center of the active zone. Immediately after stimulation, the total number of docked vesicles across all synapses decreases by [~]40%. Between 8 and 14 ms, new vesicles are recruited to the plasma membrane and fully replenish the docked pool in a calcium-dependent manner, but docking of these vesicles is transient and they either undock or fuse within 100 ms. These results demonstrate that recruitment of synaptic vesicles to release sites is rapid and reversible.",

    "abstract": "NAD kinase (NADK) is the sole enzyme that phosphorylates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+/NADH) into NADP+/NADPH, which provides the chemical reducing power in anabolic (biosynthetic) pathways. While prokaryotes typically encode a single NADK, eukaryotes encode multiple NADKs. How these different NADK genes are all related to each other and those of prokaryotes is not known. Here we conduct phylogenetic analysis of NADK genes and identify major clade-defining patterns of NADK evolution. First, almost all eukaryotic NADK genes belong to one of two ancient eukaryotic sister clades corresponding to cytosolic (\\\"cyto\\\") and mitochondrial (\\\"mito\\\") clades. Secondly, we find that the cyto-clade NADK gene is duplicated in connection with loss of the mito-clade NADK gene in several eukaryotic clades or with acquisition of plastids in Archaeplastida. Thirdly, we find that horizontal gene transfers from proteobacteria have replaced mitochondrial NADK genes in only a few rare cases. Last, we find that the eukaryotic cyto and mito paralogs are unrelated to independent duplications that occurred in sporulating bacteria, once in mycelial Actinobacteria and once in aerobic endospore-forming Firmicutes. Altogether these findings show that the eukaryotic NADK gene repertoire is ancient and evolves episodically with major evolutionary transitions.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMetabolic enzymes are central to all living organisms and key to understanding the evolution of life on Earth. One important component of all metabolic pathways is the participation of chemically-reducing cofactors such as the redox system of NAD+ and NADH molecules. All living cells also possess a system for shifting their intracellular pool of NAD+ and NADH into NADP+ and NADPH via phosphorylation by the NAD kinase (NADK). Phosphorylation by NADK allows cells to regulate the use of their main chemical redox system for anabolic growth and the synthesis of basic cellular components. In our study we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the NAD kinase family. We find that eukaryotes possess two ancient NADK gene families of unknown provenance and also find unrelated bacterial families that also possess dual NADK genes. We also find that while NADK evolution has been mostly stable through the eons, this family has evolved substantially in association with the evolution of specific clades of organisms. Altogether these results provide a metabolic picture of the tree of life and its evolution.",
