    "abstract": "An important problem that hinders the use of supervised classification algorithms for brain imaging is that the number of variables per single subject far exceeds the number of training subjects available. Deriving multivariate measures of variable importance becomes a challenge in such scenarios. This paper proposes a new measure of variable importance termed sign-consistency bagging (SCB). The SCB captures variable importance by analyzing the sign consistency of the corresponding weights in an ensemble of linear support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Further, the SCB variable importances are enhanced by means of transductive conformal analysis. This extra step is important when the data can be assumed to be heterogeneous. Finally, the proposal of these SCB variable importance measures is completed with the derivation of a parametric hypothesis test of variable importance. The new importance measures were compared with a t-test based univariate and an SVM-based multivariate variable importances using anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. The obtained results demonstrated that the new SCB based importance measures were superior to the compared methods in terms of reproducibility and classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In meiosis, crossovers between homologous chromosomes link them together. This enables them to attach to microtubules of the meiotic spindle as a unit, such that the homologs will be pulled away from one another at anaphase I. Homologous pairs can sometimes fail to become linked by crossovers. In some organisms, these non-exchange partners are still able segregate properly. In several organisms, associations between the centromeres of non-exchange partners occur in meiotic prophase. These associations have been proposed to promote segregation in meiosis I. But how centromere pairing could promote subsequent proper segregation is unclear. Here we report that meiotic centromere pairing if chromosomes in mouse spermatocytes allows the formation of an association between chromosome pairs. We find that peri-centromeric heterochromatin connections tether the centromeres of chromosome pairs after dissolution of centromere paring. Our results suggest that, in mouse spermatocytes, heterochromatin maintains the association of chromosome centromeres in the absence crossing-over.",

    "abstract": "Skillful control of movement is central to our ability to sense and manipulate the world. A large body of work in nonhuman primates has demonstrated that motor cortex provides flexible, time-varying activity patterns that control the arm during reaching and grasping. Previous studies have suggested that these patterns are generated by strong local recurrent dynamics operating autonomously from inputs during movement execution. An alternative possibility is that motor cortex requires coordination with upstream brain regions throughout the entire movement in order to yield these patterns. Here, we developed an experimental preparation in the mouse to directly test these possibilities using optogenetics and electrophysiology during a skilled reach-to-grab-to-eat task. To validate this preparation, we first established that a specific, time-varying pattern of motor cortical activity was required to produce coordinated movement. Next, in order to disentangle the contribution of local recurrent motor cortical dynamics from external input, we optogenetically held the recurrent contribution constant, then observed how motor cortical activity recovered following the end of this perturbation. Both the neural responses and hand trajectory varied from trial to trial, and this variability reflected variability in external inputs. To directly probe the role of these inputs, we used optogenetics to perturb activity in the thalamus. Thalamic perturbation at the start of the trial prevented movement initiation, and perturbation at any stage of the movement prevented progression of the hand to the target; this demonstrates that input is required throughout the movement. By comparing motor cortical activity with and without thalamic perturbation, we were able to estimate the effects of external inputs on motor cortical population activity. Thus, unlike pattern-generating circuits that are local and autonomous, such as those in the spinal cord that generate left-right alternation during locomotion, the pattern generator for reaching and grasping is distributed across multiple, strongly-interacting brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation in new environments depends on the amount and type of genetic variation available for evolution, and the efficacy by which natural selection discriminates among this variation to favour the survival of the fittest. However, whether some environments systematically reveal more genetic variation in fitness, or impose stronger selection pressures than others, is typically not known. Here, we apply enzyme kinetic theory to show that rising global temperatures are predicted to intensify natural selection systematically throughout the genome by increasing the effects of DNA sequence variation on protein stability. We tested this prediction by i) estimating temperature-dependent fitness effects of induced random mutations in seed beetles adapted to ancestral or warm temperature, and ii) calculating 100 paired selection estimates on mutations in benign versus stressful environments from a diverse set of unicellular and multicellular organisms. Environmental stress per se did not increase the mean strength of selection on de novo mutation, suggesting that the cost of adaptation does not generally increase in new environments to which the organism is maladapted. However, elevated temperature increased the mean strength of selection on genome-wide polymorphism, signified by increases in both mutation load and mutational variance at elevated temperature. The theoretical predictions and empirical data suggest that this increase may correspond to a doubling of genome-wide selection for a predicted 2-4{degrees}C climate warming scenario in ectothermic organism living at temperatures close to their thermal optimum. These results have important implications for global patterns of genetic diversity and the rate and repeatability of evolution under climate change.\n\nImpact StatementNatural environments are constantly changing so organisms must also change to persist. Whether they can do so ultimately depends upon the reservoir of raw genetic material available for evolution, and the efficacy by which natural selection discriminates among this variation to favour the survival of the fittest. Here, the biochemical properties of molecules and proteins that underpin the link between genotype and phenotype can exert a major influence over how the physical environment affects the expression of phenotypes and the fitness consequences of DNA sequence polymorphism. Yet, the constraints set by these molecular features are often neglected within eco-evolutionary theory trying to predict evolution in new environments. Here we combine predictions from existing biophysical models of protein folding and enzyme kinetics with experimental data from ectothermic organisms across the tree of life, to show that rising global temperatures are predicted to increase the mean strength of selection on DNA sequence variation in cold-blooded organisms. We also show that environmental stress per se generally does not increase the mean strength of selection on new mutations, suggesting that genome-wide natural selection is not stronger in new environments to which an organism is maladapted. Theoretical predictions and data suggest that an expected climate warming scenario of a 2-4{degrees}C temperature raise within the forthcoming century will result in roughly a doubling of genome-wide selection for organisms living close to their thermal optima. However, our results also point to substantial variability in the temperature-dependence of selection on different proteins within and between organisms, suggesting scope for compensatory adaptation to shape this relationship. These results bear witness to and extend the universal temperature dependence of biological rates and have important implications for global patterns of genetic diversity and the rate and repeatability of genome evolution under environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Global food production is set to keep increasing despite a predicted decrease in total arable land [1]. To achieve higher production, denser planting will be required on increasingly degraded soils. When grown in dense stands, crops elongate and raise their leaves in an effort to reach sunlight, a process termed shade-avoidance [2]. Shade is perceived by a reduction in the ratio of red (R) to (FR) light and results in the stabilisation of a class of transcription factors known as PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) [3,4]. PIFs activate the expression of auxin biosynthesis genes [4,5] and enhance auxin sensitivity [6], which promotes cell wall loosening and drives elongation growth. Despite our molecular understanding of shade-induced growth, little is known about how this developmental programme is integrated with other environmental factors.\\n\\nHere we demonstrate that low levels of NaCl in soil strongly impair the ability of plants to respond to shade. This block is dependent upon abscisic acid (ABA) signalling and the canonical ABA signalling pathway. Low R:FR light enhances the expression of a positive regulator of the brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway, BRASSINOSTEROID SIGNALLING KINASE 5 (BSK5). We found that ABA inhibits BSK5 up-regulation and interferes with GSK3-like kinase inactivation by the BR pathway, thus leading to a suppression of PIF function. By demonstrating a link between the ABA and BR-signalling pathways this study provides an important step forward in our understanding of how environmental cues are integrated into plant development.",

The networks responsible for encoding and retrieving this value are largely unknown.

Projection-specific and bidirectional chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations revealed the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) supports the BLA in these processes. Critically, the function of ventrolateral (lOFC) and medial (mOFC) OFC[-&gt;]BLA projections was found to be doubly dissociable. Whereas activity in lOFC[-&gt;]BLA projections is necessary for and sufficient to drive encoding of a positive change in the value of a reward, mOFC[-&gt;]BLA projections are necessary and sufficient for retrieving this value from memory to guide its pursuit. These data reveal a new circuit for adaptive reward valuation and pursuit, indicate dissociability in the encoding and retrieval of reward memories, and provide insight into the dysfunction in these processes that characterizes myriad psychiatric diseases.",

    "abstract": "The mathematical theory describing small assemblages of interacting species (community modules or motifs) has proved to be essential in understanding the emergent properties of ecological communities. These models use differential equations to study pairwise interactions between species. However, as community modules become more complex, it is not certain that all potential interactions will be effectively realized. Here, we use community modules to experimentally explore whether the number of trophic links among species scales with community complexity (i.e., by adding species known to feed on each other from pair-wise trials). To investigate this question, we used a simple mite community present in avocado orchards (Persea americana), composed of two predators (Euseius stipulatus and Neoseiulus californicus), one herbivore as shared prey (Oligonychus perseae), and pollen of Carpobrotus edulis as an alternative food resource. These configurations enabled the potential for (intraguild) predation and (apparent) competition to be expressed. Using a series of controls, we assessed whether the presence of one species affected the survival of another, or its conversion of food into offspring). We found that increasing the number of potential interactions did not result in more complex realized community modules. Instead, all communities were reduced to one or two linear trophic chains. Our results show that trophic links assumed to occur when species are assembled in pairs do not necessarily occur when other components of the community are present. Consequently, food-web structure may be unrealistic in theoretical community modules that are parameterized based on pair-wise interactions observed when alternative prey is absent. This further suggests the need for empirical research to work in concert with theoretical approaches to develop more realistic and predictive food-web models.",

Nonetheless, conducting such exercise stress tests routinely is often inconvenient and logistically challenging for patients.

In recent years, an increasing number of human diseases have been found to be associated with ERVs. However, it remains challenging to accurately detect the full spectrum of polymorphic (unfixed) ERVs using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data.\\n\\nResultsWe designed a new tool, ERVcaller, to detect and genotype transposable element (TE) insertions, including ERVs, in the human genome. We evaluated ERVcaller using both simulated and real benchmark whole-genome sequencing (WGS) datasets. By comparing with existing tools, ERVcaller consistently obtained both the highest sensitivity and precision for detecting simulated ERV and other TE insertions derived from real polymorphic TE sequences. For the WGS data from the 1000 Genomes Project, ERVcaller detected the largest number of TE insertions per sample based on consensus TE loci. By analyzing the experimentally verified TE insertions, ERVcaller had 94.0% TE detection sensitivity and 96.6% genotyping accuracy. PCR and Sanger sequencing in a small sample set verified 86.7% of examined insertion statuses and 100% of examined genotypes. In conclusion, ERVcaller is capable of detecting and genotyping TE insertions using WGS data with both high sensitivity and precision.

    "abstract": "There is widespread agreement that episodic memory is organized into a timeline of past experiences. Recent work suggests that the hippocampus may parse the flow of experience into discrete episodes separated by event boundaries. A complementary body of work suggests that context changes gradually as experience unfolds. We recorded from hippocampal neurons as male long evans rats performed 6 blocks of an object discrimination task in sets of 15 trials. Each block was separated by removal from the testing chamber for a delay to enable segmentation. The reward contingency reversed from one block to the next to incentivize segmentation. We expected animals to hold two distinct, recurring representations of context to match the two distinct rule contingencies. Instead, we found that overtrained rats began each block neither above nor below chance but by guessing randomly. While many units had clear firing fields selective to the conjunction of objects in places, a significant population also reflected a continuously drifting code both within block and across blocks. Despite clear boundaries between blocks, we saw no neural evidence for event segmentation in this experiment. Rather, the hippocampal ensemble drifted continuously across time. This continuous drift in the neural representation was consistent with the lack of segmentation observed in behavior.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe neuroscience literature yet to reach consensus as to how hippocampal firing fields support the organizing of events across time in episodic memory. Initial reports of hippocampal activity focused on discrete episodes within which representations were stable, and across which representations remapped. However, it remains unclear whether this segmentation of representations is merely an artifact of cue responsivity. More recently, research has shown that a proportion of the population codes for temporal aspects of context by exhibiting varying degrees of drift in their firing fields. Drift is hypothesized to represent a continually evolving temporal context, however it is unclear whether this drift is continuous or is also a mere artifact of changing experiences. We recorded from the dorsal hippocampus of rats performing an object discrimination task that involved contexts that were segmented in time. Overtrained rats were unable to anticipate the identity of the upcoming context, but may have used context boundaries to their advantage. Event segmentation theory predicts that hippocampal ensembles would alternate between behaviorally-relevant segments. Contrary to these predictions, animals showed weak evidence of context segmentation, even across blocks with different reward contingencies. Hippocampal ensembles showed neither evidence of alternating between stable contexts nor sensitivity to context boundaries, but did show robust temporal drift.",

    "abstract": "Motor variability is inevitable in our body movements and is discussed from several various perspectives in motor neuroscience and biomechanics; it can originate from the variability of neural activities, it can reflect a large degree of freedom inherent in our body movements, it can decrease muscle fatigue, or it can facilitate motor learning. How to evaluate motor variability is thus a fundamental question in motor neuroscience and biomechanics. Previous methods have quantified (at least) two striking features of motor variability; the smaller variability in the task-relevant dimension than in the task-irrelevant dimension and the low-dimensional structure that is often referred to as synergy or principal component. However, those previous methods were not only unsuitable for quantifying those features simultaneously but also applicable in some limited conditions (e.g., a method cannot consider motion sequence, and another method cannot consider how each motion is relevant to performance). Here, we propose a flexible and straightforward machine learning technique that can quantify task-relevant variability, task-irrelevant variability, and the relevance of each principal component to task performance while considering the motion sequence and the relevance of each motion sequence to task performance in a data-driven manner. We validate our method by constructing a novel experimental setting to investigate goal-directed and whole-body movements. Furthermore, our setting enables the induction of motor adaptation by using perturbation and evaluating the modulation of task-relevant and task-irrelevant variabilities through motor adaptation. Our method enables the identification of a novel property of motor variability; the modulation of those variabilities differs depending on the perturbation schedule. Although a gradually imposed perturbation does not increase both task-relevant and task-irrelevant variabilities, a constant perturbation increases task-relevant variability.",

    "abstract": "We have previously reported a replicable association between variants at the PDE4D gene and familial schizophrenia in a Finnish cohort. In order to identify the potential functional mutations alluded to by these previous findings, we sequenced the 1.5Mb of the PDE4D genomic locus in 20 families (consisting of 96 individuals, and 79 independent chromosomes), followed by two stages of genotyping across 6,668 individuals from multiple Finnish cohorts for major mental illnesses. We identified 4,570 SNPs across the PDE4D gene, with 380 associated to schizophrenia (p[&le;]0.05). Importantly, two of these variants, rs35278 and rs165940, are located at transcription factor binding sites, and displayed replicable association in the two-stage enlargement of the familial schizophrenia cohort, (combined statistics for rs35278 p=0.0012; OR=1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.32; and rs165940 p=0.0016; OR=1.27, 95% CI 1.13-1.41). Further analysis using additional cohorts and endophenotypes revealed that rs165940 principally associates within the psychosis (p=0.025, OR=1.18, 95% CI 1.07-1.30) and cognitive domains of major mental illnesses (g-score p=0.044, beta=-0.033). Specifically, the cognitive domains represented verbal learning and memory (p=0.0091, beta=-0.044) and verbal working memory (p=0.0062, beta=-0.036). Moreover, expression data from the GTEx database demonstrated that rs165940 significantly correlates with the mRNA expression levels of PDE4D in the cerebellum (p-value=0.04; m-value=0.9), demonstrating a potential functional consequence for this variant. Thus, rs165940 represents the most likely functional variant for major mental illness at the PDE4D locus in the Finnish population, increasing risk broadly to psychotic disorders.",

Activation of the Wingless-related-integration-site (WNT) pathway is associated with a bad prognosis. Using Drosophila and primary xenograft models of human GB, we describe a mechanism that leads to the activation of WNT signaling [Wingless (Wg) in Drosophila] in tumor cells. GB cells display a network of tumor microtubes (TMs) which enwraps neurons, accumulates Wg receptor Frizzled1 (Fz1), and, thereby, actively depletes Wg from the neurons. Consequently, GB cells proliferate due to {beta}-catenin activation, and neurons degenerate due to Wg signaling extinction. This novel view explains both neuron-dependent tumor progression, and also the neural decay associated with GB.",

Decoding the relationship TF binding patterns and the regulation of cognate target genes is nontrivial, remaining a fundamental limitation in understanding cell decision-making mechanisms. Identification of TF physical binding that is biologically  neutral is a current challenge. We studied cell identity in the context of Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a cell programme fundamental for normal embryonic development that contributes to tumour progression and fibrosis.\\n\\nResultsWe developed the NetNC software for discovery of functionally coherent TF targets. NetNC was applied to analyse gene regulation by the EMT TFs Snail, Twist in early embryogenesis and also to modENCODE  HOT regions. Predicted neutral binding accounted for 50% to [&ge;]80% of candidate target genes assigned from significant binding peaks. Novel gene functions and network modules were identified, including regulation of chromatin organisation and crosstalk with notch signalling. Orthologues of predicted TF targets discriminated breast cancer molecular subtypes and NetNC analysis predicted new gene functions; for example, evidencing networks that reshape Waddingtons landscape during EMT-like phenotype switching. Predicted invasion roles for SNX29, ATG3, UNK and IRX4 were validated using a tractable cell model.\\n\\nConclusionsWe found extensive neutral TF binding across the nine datasets examined and showed that NetNC performs well in identifying functionally coherent targets. HOT regions had comparatively high functional coherence.

    "abstract": "BackgroundMultiplexed in-situ fluorescent imaging offers several advantages over single-cell assays that do not preserve the spatial characteristics of biological samples. This spatial information, in addition to morphological properties and extensive intracellular or surface marker profiling, comprise promising avenues for rapid advancements in the understanding of disease progression and diagnosis. As protocols for conducting such imaging experiments continue to improve, it is the intent of this study to provide and validate software for processing the large quantity of associated data in kind.\\n\\nResultsCytokit offers (i) an end-to-end, GPU-accelerated image processing pipeline; (ii) efficient input/output (I/O) strategies for operations specific to high dimensional microscopy; and (iii) an interactive user interface for cross filtering of spatial, graphical, expression, and morphological cell properties within the 100+ GB image datasets common to multiplexed immunofluorescence. Image processing operations supported in Cytokit are generally sourced from existing deep learning models or are at least in part adapted from open source packages to run in a single or multi-GPU environment. The efficacy of these operations is demonstrated through several imaging experiments that pair Cytokit results with those from an independent but comparable assay. A further validation also demonstrates that previously published results can be reproduced from a publicly available multiplexed image dataset.\\n\\nConclusionCytokit is a collection of open source tools for quantifying and analyzing properties of individual cells in large fluorescent microscopy datasets that are often, but not necessarily, generated from multiplexed antibody labeling protocols over many fields of view or time periods.

    "abstract": "Thousands of species of bees are in global decline, yet research addressing the ecology and status of these wild pollinators lags far behind work being done to address similar impacts on the managed honey bee. This knowledge gap is especially glaring in natural areas, despite knowledge that protected habitats harbor and export diverse bee communities into nearby croplands where their pollination services have been valued at over $3 billion per year. Surrounded by ranches and farmlands, Pinnacles National Park in the Inner South Coast Range of California contains intact Mediterranean chaparral shrubland. This habitat type is among the most valuable for bee biodiversity worldwide, as well as one of the most vulnerable to agricultural conversion, urbanization and climate change. Pinnacles National Park is also one of a very few locations where extensive native bee inventory efforts have been repeated over time. This park thus presents a valuable and rare opportunity to monitor long-term trends and baseline variability of native bees in natural habitats. Fifteen years after a species inventory marked Pinnacles as a biodiversity hotspot for native bees, we resurveyed these native bee communities over two flowering seasons using a systematic, plot-based design. Combining results, we report a total of 450 bee species within this 109km2 natural area of California, including 48 new species records as of 2012 and 95 species not seen since 1999. As far as we are aware, this species richness marks Pinnacles National Park as one of the most densely diverse places known for native bees. We explore patterns of bee diversity across this protected landscape, compare results to other surveyed natural areas, and highlight the need for additional repeated inventories in protected areas over time amid widespread concerns of bee declines.",

The ability to learn complex patterns in data has tremendous implications in the genomics and immunology worlds, where sequence motifs become learned  features that can be used to predict functionality, guiding our understanding of disease and basic biology 3-6. T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing assesses the diversity of the adaptive immune system, where complex structural patterns in the TCR can be used to model its antigenic interaction. We present DeepTCR, a broad collection of unsupervised and supervised deep learning methods able to uncover structure in highly complex and large TCR sequencing data by learning a joint representation of a given TCR by its CDR3 sequences, V/D/J gene usage, and HLA background in which the T-cells reside. We demonstrate the utility of deep learning to provide an improved  featurization of the TCR across multiple human and murine datasets, including improved classification of antigen-specific TCRs in both unsupervised and supervised learning tasks, understanding immunotherapy-related shaping of repertoire in the murine setting, and predicting response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy from pre-treatment tumor biopsies in a clinical trial of melanoma.

However, activation of the hypoxia response has been shown to protect mice against metabolic dysfunction2-4. We used Hb levels as an indicator for oxygenation status and studied its association with >170 anthropometric and metabolic parameters in two Finnish birth cohorts both in cross-sectional and longitudinal design (max n = 7,175). Here we show a positive linear association between Hb levels and body mass index (BMI). Subjects with the lower Hb levels had better glucose tolerance, lower cholesterol and blood pressure levels, less adverse metabolite profiles and lower inflammatory load. Notably, these associations were not only mediated by the lower BMI, and the effect size of many of them increased with age. Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses indicated shared genetic determinants between Hb levels and BMI, insulin, triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses could not demonstrate causal relationships between Hb and metabolic parameters. However, manipulation of Hb levels by venesection in mice showed evidence for causal associations with body weight and metabolic parameters. Our findings suggest that lower-end normal Hb levels may be favorable for systemic metabolism involving mild chronic activation of the hypoxia response. Therefore modulation of Hb levels could be a novel strategy towards maintenance of metabolic health.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBird plumage exhibits a diversity of colors that serve functional roles ranging from signaling to camouflage and thermoregulation. However, birds must maintain a balance between evolving colorful signals to attract mates, minimizing conspicuousness to predators, and optimizing adaptation to climate conditions. Examining plumage color macroevolution provides a framework for understanding this dynamic interplay over phylogenetic scales. Plumage evolution due to a single overarching process, such as selection, may generate the same macroevolutionary pattern of color variation across all body regions. In contrast, independent processes may partition plumage into sections and produce region-specific patterns. To test these alternative scenarios, we collected color data from museum specimens of an ornate clade of birds, the Australasian lorikeets, using visible-light and UV-light photography, and comparative methods. We predicted that the diversification of homologous feather regions, i.e., patches, known to be involved in sexual signaling (e.g., face) would be less constrained than patches on the back and wings, where new color states may come at the cost of crypsis. Because environmental adaptation may drive evolution towards or away from color states, we tested whether climate more strongly covaried with plumage regions under greater or weaker macroevolutionary constraint.\\n\\nResultsWe found that alternative macroevolutionary models and varying rates best describe color evolution, a pattern consistent with our prediction that different plumage regions evolved in response to independent processes. Modeling plumage regions independently, in functional groups, and all together showed that patches with similar macroevolutionary models clustered together into distinct regions (e.g., head, wing, belly), which suggests that plumage does not evolve as a single trait in this group. Wing patches, which were conserved on a macroevolutionary scale, covaried with climate more strongly than plumage regions (e.g., head), which diversified in a burst.\\n\\nConclusionsOverall, our results support the hypothesis that the extraordinary color diversity in the lorikeets was generated by a mosaic of evolutionary processes acting on plumage region subsets. Partitioning of plumage regions in different parts of the body provides a mechanism that allows birds to evolve bright colors for signaling and remain hidden from predators or adapt to local climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "The progressive reduction of gut microbiome (GM) biodiversity along human evolutionary history has been found to be particularly exacerbated in Western urban compared to traditional rural populations, and supposed to contribute to the increasing incidence of chronic non-communicable diseases. Together with sanitation, antibiotics and C-section, the Western diets, low in microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) while rich in industrialized and processed foods, are considered one of the leading causes of this shrinkage. However, significant questions remain unanswered, especially whether high-MAC low-processed diets may be sufficient to recover GM diversity in Western urban populations. Here, we profiled the GM structure of urban Italian subjects adhering to the modern Paleolithic diet (MPD), a dietary pattern featured by high consumption of MACs and low-to-zero intake of refined sugars and processed foods, and compared data with other Italian individuals following a Mediterranean Diet (MD), as well as worldwide traditional hunter-gatherer populations from previous publications. Notwithstanding a strong geography effect on the GM structure, our results show an unexpectedly high degree of GM biodiversity in MPD subjects, which well approximates that of traditional populations. Increasing the consumption of MACs at the expense of refined sugars, and minimizing the intake of processed foods, both hallmarks of the MPD, could be the key to rewild the Western microbiota, counteracting the loss of GM diversity and thus restoring evolutionarily important functionality to our gut for improved human health.",

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) arises from malignant immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells and remains an incurable, often lethal disease despite recent therapeutic advances. The unfolded-protein response sensor IRE1 supports protein secretion by deploying a kinase-endoribonuclease module to activate the transcription factor XBP1s. MM cells may coopt the IRE1-XBP1s pathway; however, the validity of IRE1 as a potential MM therapeutic target is controversial. Here we show that genetic disruption of IRE1 or XBP1s, or pharmacologic IRE1 kinase inhibition, attenuated subcutaneous or orthometastatic growth of MM tumors in mice, and augmented efficacy of two well-established frontline antimyeloma agents, bortezomib or lenalidomide. Mechanistically, IRE1 perturbation inhibited expression of key components of the ER-associated degradation machinery, as well as cytokines and chemokines known to promote MM growth. Selective IRE1 kinase inhibition reduced viability of CD138+ plasma cells while sparing CD138- cells from bone marrow of newly diagnosed MM patients or patients whose disease relapsed after 1 - 4 lines of treatment in both US- and EU-based cohorts. IRE1 inhibition preserved survival and glucose-induced insulin secretion by pancreatic microislets. Together, these results establish a strong therapeutic rationale for targeting IRE1 with kinase-based small-molecule inhibitors in MM.\\n\\nSignificance statementMultiple myeloma (MM) is a lethal malignancy of plasma cells. MM cells have an expanded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is constantly under stress due to immunoglobulin hyperproduction. The ER-resident sensor IRE1 mitigates ER stress by expanding the ERs protein-folding capacity while supporting proteasomal degradation of misfolded ER proteins. IRE1 elaborates these functions by deploying its cytoplasmic kinase-RNase module to activate the transcription factor XBP1s. The validity of IRE1 as a potential therapeutic target in MM has been questioned. Using genetic and pharmacologic disruption in vitro and in vivo, we demonstrate that the IRE1-XBP1s pathway plays a critical role in MM growth. We further show that IRE1s kinase domain is an effective and safe potential small-molecule target for MM therapy.",

    "abstract": "Ecological and evolutionary effects of individual variation on species coexistence remains unclear. Competition models for coexistence have emphasized species-level differences in pairwise interactions, and invoked no role for intraspecific variation. These models show that stronger competitive interactions result in smaller numbers of coexisting species. However, the presence of higher-order interactions (HOIs) among species appears to have a stabilizing influence on communities. How species coexistence is affected in a community where both pairwise and higher-order interactions are pervasive is not known. Furthermore, the effect of individual variation on species coexistence in complex communities with pairwise and HOIs remains untested. Using a Lotka-Volterra model, we explore the effects of intraspecific variation on the patterns of species coexistence in a competitive community dictated by pairwise and HOIs. We found that HOIs greatly stabilize species coexistence across different levels of strength in competition. Notably, high intraspecific variation promoted species coexistence, particularly when competitive interactions were strong. However, species coexistence promoted by higher levels of variation was less robust to environmental perturbation. Additionally, species traits tend to cluster together when individual variation in the community increased. We argue that individual variation can promote species coexistence by reducing trait divergence and attenuating the inhibitory effects of dominant species through HOIs",

    "abstract": "Here human trichromats were presented with two types of scenes - geometric and real-world scenes -tinted with a shade of colour in order to destabilize the perceived illumination, and chromaticity of the retinal image of each scene. Each trichromat was instructed to adjust the chromaticity of the object embedded within each scene until its surface appeared devoid of any hue in the DKL colour space which spans two chromatic opponent axes - the S-(L+M) and L- M axis - and a luminance axis - the L+M axis. The following observations were made : (i) across scenes, adjustments were dispersed along the S-(L+M) axis, along which daylight is known to vary; (ii) across trichromats, for the geometric scenes, adjustments were biased towards the S pole of the S-(L+M) axis for one group (group 1), and towards the (L+M) pole for the other group (group 2); (iii) for the real-world scenes, adjustments for both groups systematically converged towards the (L+M) pole. These results suggest that when the core set of priors upon which the human visual system typically relies become ill-equipped, the human visual system is able to recruit one of the two illumination priors - PriorS or PriorL+M - in combination with the representation it has formed over time about the spectral composition of the illuminant associated with scenes the trichromatic observer is currently being exposed to within its ecological niche, as it attempts to stabilize the chromaticity of the retinal image of real-world scenes.",

Left ventricular non-compaction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy were diagnosed when patients fulfilled current clinical and echocardiographic criteria. Clinical and echocardiographic characteristics including comorbidities, heart failure presentation, BAV morphology, function, and aorta phenotypes in BAV subjects with or without specific cardiomyopathies were compared.\\n\\nResultsOverall, 67 subjects (5.6 %) had concomitant cardiomyopathies: 40 (3.4%) patients with left ventricular non-compaction, 17 (1.4%) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 10 (0.8%) with dilated cardiomyopathy. BAV subjects with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and tended to have type 0 phenotype, while BAV subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy showed a higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. BAV subjects with left ventricular non-compaction were significantly younger, predominantly male, and had greater BAV dysfunction and a higher prevalence of normal aorta shape.

    "abstract": "Red and processed meat have been associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), whereas long-term use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may reduce the risk. The aim was to investigate potential interactions between meat intake, NSAID use, and gene variants in fatty acid metabolism and NSAID pathways in relation to the risk of CRC. A nested case-cohort study of 1038 CRC cases and 1857 randomly selected participants from the Danish prospective \\\"Diet, Cancer and Health\\\" study encompassing 57,053 persons was performed using the Cox proportional hazard models. Gene variants in SLC25A20, PRKAB1, LPCAT1, PLA2G4A, ALOX5, PTGER3, TP53, CCAT2, TCF7L2, BCL2 were investigated. CCAT2 rs6983267 was associated with risk of CRC per se (p<0.01). Statistically significant interactions were found between intake of red and processed meat and CCAT2 rs6983267, TP53 rs1042522, LPCAT1 rs7737692, SLC25A20 rs7623023 (pinteraction=0.04, 0.04, 0.02, 0.03, respectively), and use of NSAID and alcohol intake and TP53 rs1042522 (pinteraction=0.04, 0.04, respectively) in relation to risk of CRC. No other consistent associations or interactions were found. This study replicated an association of CCAT2 rs6983267 with CRC and an interaction between TP53 rs1042522 and NSAID in relation to CRC. Interactions between genetic variants in fatty acid metabolism and NSAID pathway and intake of red and processed meat were found. Our results suggest that meat intake and NSAID use affect the same carcinogenic mechanisms. All new findings should be sought replicated in independent prospective studies. Future studies on the cancer-protective effects of aspirin/NSAID should include gene and meat assessments.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIntake of red and processed meat has been associated with risk of cancer and in particular colorectal cancer. However, the underlying biological mechanisms are only incompletely understood. Gene-environment interaction analysis may be used for identifying underlying mechanisms for e.g. meat carcinogenesis. In this work, we have analyzed the interaction between the intake of red and processed meat, use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (including the anti-carcinogenic drug aspirin) and genetic variants. Our results suggest that meat intake and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug use affect the same carcinogenic mechanisms. These results need to be replicated in other cohort studies with lifestyle information. If replicated, these results may have future implications for developing new strategies for preventing colorectal cancer and other cancers that share similar pathways.",

    "abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a systemic infection caused by tick-borne pathogenic borreliae of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex or of the more heterogeneous relapsing fever borrelia group. Clinical distinction of the infections due to different borrelia species is difficult. Accurate knowledge of the prevalence and the species of borreliae in the infected ticks in the endemic areas is valuable for formulating appropriate guidelines for proper management of this infectious disease. The purpose of this research was to design a readily implementable protocol to detect the divergent species of borreliae known to exist in Europe, using Irish samples of Ixodes ricinus ticks as the subject for study. Questing I. ricinus nymph samples were taken at six localities within Ireland. The crude DNA of each dried tick was extracted by hot NH4OH and used to initiate a same-nested PCR with a pair of borrelial genus-specific primers to amplify a highly conserved 357/358 bp segment of the 16S rRNA gene for detection and as the template for Sanger sequencing. To distinguish B. garinii from B. burgdorferi and to discriminate the various strains of B. garinii, a second 282 bp segment of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified for Sanger sequencing. A signature segment of the DNA sequence excised from the computer-generated electropherogram was submitted to the GenBank for BLAST alignment analysis. A 100% ID match with the unique reference sequence in the GenBank was required for the molecular diagnosis of the borrelial species or strain. We found the overall rate of borrelial infection in the Irish tick population to be 5%, with a range from 2% to 12% depending on the locations of tick collection. At least 3 species, namely B. garinii, B. valaisiana and B. miyamotoi, are infecting the ticks collected in Ireland. The isolates of B. garinii were confirmed to be strain BgVir, strain Bernie or strain T25. Since antigens for diagnostic serology tests may be species- or even strain-specific, expanded surveillance of the species and strains of the borreliae among human-biting ticks in Ireland is needed to ensure that the antigens used for the serology tests do contain the epitopes matching the antibodies elicited by the borrelial species and strains in the ticks cohabitating in the same environment.",

Partial least-squares regression (PLSR) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN) were applied to build models that reflect the relationship between content of FAs and extraction conditions (temperature, time, and extraction solvent). Genetic algorithms (GAs) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) were utilized to optimize the combination of extraction conditions. The composition of FAs was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The PLSR models could reflect the relationship of FA content in both BCS and SCS and extraction conditions well, while the BPNN model was more suitable for TCS. The optimal extraction conditions for BCS and SCS were obtained by GAs, whereas those of TCS were obtained by PSO. The FA compositions of the three Coix seeds exhibited differences. The results show that ASE combined with chemometrics methods can rapidly and effectively obtain the optimal conditions for the extraction of FAs from Coix seed and there are differences in the extraction conditions and compositions of FAs among different varieties of Coix seed, but all the extraction time is shorter than other extractions methods.",

This study is an attempt to identify the areas of public interest, related to diabetes, by looking at online discussion forums and to evaluate their relationship to pages about diabetes found on Wikipedia and to the academic research about the topic. The main aim is to investigate the extent to which researchers are responding to the publics interests and concerns, and to the level of uptake of the research topics in the public sphere.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal findingsTo detect public interests and concerns in diabetes, we collected posts on a popular diabetes discussion forum (DiabeticConnect) and pages (articles) about diabetes published in Wikipedia. We also downloaded the titles and abstracts of research articles about diabetes from the Scopus database, all between 2008 and 2016. Tags assigned to each post in the discussion forum were used along with the post itself to compute a Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LLDA) model, which was then used to classify the Wikipedia pages and research articles. The resulting classifications were then used to compare the prevalence of the topics found in the discussion forum with those of the other two sources. The results show that while research articles and Wikipedia pages about diabetes focus on diabetes testing, treatments, and disease control, the public forum discussions focus on Type 2 diabetes, emotional support, and proper diet for diabetic patients. However, for some other topics there was an alignment in the relative rise and fall of interest across the three platforms.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceThe alignment and misalignment in the changes of relative interest over the various topics is evidence that the LLDA modelling can be useful for comparing a public corpus, like a diabetes forum, and an academic one, like research titles and abstracts. The success of using LLDA to classify research articles based on the tags assigned to posts in a public discussion forum shows that this a promising method for better understanding how the scientific community responds to public interests and needs, and, on the flip side, how the public takes up the language and topics discussed by the academic community.",

    "abstract": "The epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the male vs. female cell-fate decision in the mammalian bipotential gonad are poorly understood. In this study, we developed a quantitative genome-wide profile of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in isolated XY and XX gonadal supporting cells before and after sex determination. We show that male and female sex-determining (SD) genes are bivalent before sex determination, providing insight into how the bipotential state of the gonad is established at the epigenetic level. After sex determination, many SD genes of the alternate pathway remain bivalent, possibly contributing to the ability of these cells to transdifferentiate even in adults. It was previously shown that loss of CBX2, the Polycomb group subunit that binds H3K27me3 and mediates silencing, leads to loss of Sry and male-to-female sex reversal. The finding that many genes in the Wnt signaling pathway were targeted for H3K27me3-mediated repression in Sertoli cells led us to test whether deletion of Wnt4 could rescue male development in Cbx2 mutants. We show that Sry expression and testis development were rescued in XY Cbx2-/-;Wnt4-/- mice. Furthermore, we show that CBX2 directly binds the downstream Wnt signaler Lef1, a female-promoting gene that remains bivalent in Sertoli cells. Our results suggest that stabilization of the male fate requires CBX2-mediated repression of bivalent female-determining genes, which would otherwise block Sry expression and male development.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDuring development, the bipotential fetal gonad can commit to the male fate and develop as a testis, or to the female fate and develop as an ovary. Mutation of the epigenetic regulator CBX2 leads to ovary development in XY embryos, suggesting a critical role for chromatin remodeling during sex determination. However, the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the male vs. female cell-fate decision in the mammalian bipotential gonad are poorly understood. In this study, we developed a genome-wide profile of two histone modifications that play critical roles during development: H3K27me3 (repressive) and H3K4me3 (active). We find that sex-determining genes that are initially co-expressed in XX and XY bipotential gonads are bivalent (marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) prior to sex determination, poised to engage either the male or female fate. Remarkably, after sex determination, repressed genes that promote the alternate fate remain bivalent. We show that stabilization of the male fate requires CBX2-mediated repression of bivalent female-determining genes, which would otherwise block testis development. Our study provides insight into how the bipotential state of the gonad is established at the epigenetic level, and how the male fate is stabilized by repression of the female fate during sex determination.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid male progeny from interspecies cross are more prone to sterility or inviability than hybrid female progeny, and the male sterility and inviability often demonstrate a parent-of-origin asymmetry. However, the underlying mechanism of asymmetric sterility or inviability remains elusive. We previously established a genome-wide hybrid incompatibility (HI) landscape between Caenorhabditis briggsae and C. nigoni by phenotyping a large collection of C. nigoni strains each carrying a C. briggsae introgression. In this study, we investigate the genetic mechanism of asymmetric sterility and inviability in both hybrid male and female progeny between the two species. Specifically, we performed reciprocal crosses between C. briggsae and different C. nigoni strains that each carries a GFP-labeled C. briggsae genomic fragment referred to as introgression, and scored the HI phenotypes in the F1 progeny. The aggregated introgressions cover 94.6% of the C. briggsae genome, including 100% of the X chromosome. Surprisingly, we observed that two C. briggsae X fragments that produce C. nigoni male sterility as an introgression rescued hybrid F1 sterility in males fathered by C. briggsae, indicating that at least two separate X-autosome interactions are involved in the hybrid male sterility. In addition, we identified another two C. briggsae genomic intervals on the Chromosome II or IV, respectively, which can rescue the inviability, but not the sterility, of hybrid F1 males fathered by C. nigoni, suggesting the involvement of differential epistatic interactions in the asymmetric hybrid male fertility and inviability. Importantly, backcrossing of the rescued sterile males with C. nigoni led to isolation of a 1.1-Mb genomic interval that specifically interacts with an X-linked introgression, which is essential for hybrid male fertility. We further identified three C. briggsae genomic intervals on the Chromosome I, II and III, respectively that produce inviability in all F1 progeny dependent or independent of the parent-of-origin. Taken together, we identified multiple independent interacting loci that are responsible for asymmetric hybrid male and female sterility and inviability, which provides important insights into the asymmetric HI and lays a foundation for their molecular characterization.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIt is common that closely related species can mate with each other, but their hybrid progeny are often sterile or inviable, especially in the male progeny. The mechanism underlying the asymmetric sterility or inviability remains poorly understood. We previously addressed this question between two nematodes, Caenorhabditis briggsae and C. nigoni, by systematic substitution of various parts of the C. nigoni genome with its C. briggsaes equivalent followed by phenotypic examination. Here we investigate the genetic mechanism of the asymmetric sterility and inviability in the hybrid F1 male and female progeny between the two species. We achieved this through crossing a cohort of C. nigoni strains each carrying a substitution with C. briggsae, which led to differential homozygosity of the C. briggsae substitution in the hybrid progeny. The aggregated substitutions cover 94.6% of the C. briggsae genome, including 100% of the X chromosome. Surprisingly, we identified two C. briggsae X fragments that produced C. nigoni male sterility as a substitution but rescued hybrid F1 sterility in males fathered by C. briggsae, indicating that at least two separate X-autosome interactions are involved in the hybrid male sterility. In addition, we identified multiple genomic intervals on C. briggsae autosomes that can rescue the inviability, but not the sterility, of hybrid F1 males fathered by C. nigoni. Importantly, we isolated a 1.1-Mb genomic interval that specifically interacts with an X-linked introgression, which is essential for hybrid male fertility. We further identified three C. briggsae genomic intervals on the Chromosome I, II and III, respectively that produce inviability in all F1 progeny dependent or independent of the parent-of-origin.

In the present study, we evaluated the role of ELF3 in the pathogenesis of bladder carcinoma (BCa) using cell line model. The cell lines with low expression of ELF3 showed increased expression of mesenchymal markers and decreased expression of epithelial markers. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analysis of ELF3 showed selective expression in low-grade BCa cell lines and tumor tissues, respectively. We demonstrated that overexpression of ELF3 in UMUC3, a mesenchymal BCa cell line resulted in reduced invasion and decreased expression of mesenchymal markers. Furthermore, using publicly available data, we found that low expression of ELF3 was associated with increased risk and poor overall survival rate in BCa. In conclusion, ELF3-modulated reversal of EMT might be a useful strategy in the treatment of bladder cancer.",

Most tissues, animal brains in particular, comprise a mix of many cell types, with mounting evidence suggesting that neurons can recognize their respective types as they organize in space8-11. How cell diversity revises the current jamming paradigm is unknown. Here, in the brain of the flatworm planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, which exhibits remarkable tissue plasticity within a simple, quantifiable nervous system12-16, we identify a distinct packing state,  chromatic jamming. Combining experiments with computational modeling, we show that neurons of distinct types form independent percolating networks barring any physical contact. This jammed state emerges as cell packing configurations become constrained by cell type-specific interactions and therefore may extend to describe cell packing in similarly complex tissues composed of multiple cell types.",

    "abstract": "Henipaviruses are severe human pathogens responsible for severe encephalitis. Their V protein is a key player in the evasion of the host innate immune response. We have previously reported a biophysical characterization of the Henipavirus V proteins and shown that they interact with DDB1, a cellular protein that is a component of the ubiquitin ligase E3 complex. Here, we serendipitously discovered that the Hendra virus V protein undergoes a liquidhydrogel phase transition. By combining experimental and bioinformatics approaches, we have identified the V region responsible for this phenomenon. This region (referred to as PNT3), which falls within the long intrinsically disordered region of V, was further investigated using a combination of biophysical and structural approaches. ThioflavinT and Congo red binding assays, together with negative-staining electron microscopy studies, show that this region forms amyloid-like, {beta}-enriched structures. Such structures are also formed in mammal cells transfected to express PNT3. Those cells also exhibit a reduced viability in the presence of a stress agent. Interestingly, mammal cells expressing a rationally designed, non-amyloidogenic PNT3 variant (PNT33A), appear to be much less sensitive to the stress agent, thus enabling the establishment of a link between fibril formation and cell toxicity. The present findings therefore pinpoint a so far never reported possible mechanism of virus-induced cell toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated skin disorder associated with severe systemic co-morbidities. Both chronic and acute forms of the disease are characterised by abnormal interleukin (IL)-36 signalling. While the mechanisms whereby IL-36 promotes cutaneous inflammation are well established, its systemic effects have not been investigated. To address this issue, we initially measured leukocyte gene expression in generalised pustular psoriasis, an acute disease variant caused by mutations of the IL-36 receptor antagonist. By undertaking whole-blood and neutrophil RNA-sequencing in affected individuals, we identified a Type-I IFN signature, which correlated with IL-36 signalling up-regulation. We then validated these observations in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. Finally, we demonstrated that IL-36 acts directly on plasmacytoid dendritic cells, where it potentiates Toll-like Receptor (TLR)-9 activation and IFN production. This effect was mediated by the induction of PLSCR1, an endosomal TLR-9 transporter. These results define an IL-36/TLR-9/Type-I IFN axis that could be targeted for the treatment of psoriasis co-morbidities.",

    "abstract": "Most connectivity metrics in neuroimaging research reduce multivariate activity patterns in regions-of-interests (ROIs) to one dimension, which leads to a loss of information. Importantly, it prevents us from investigating the transformations between patterns in different ROIs. Here, we applied linear estimation theory in order to robustly estimate the linear transformations between multivariate fMRI patterns with a cross-validated Tikhonov regularisation approach. We derived three novel metrics that describe different features of these voxel-by-voxel mappings: goodness-of-fit, sparsity and pattern deformation. The goodness-of-fit describes the degree to which the patterns in an input region can be described as a linear transformation of patterns in an output region. The sparsity metric, which relies on a Monte Carlo procedure, was introduced in order to test whether the transformation mostly consists of one-to-one mappings between voxels in different regions. Furthermore, we defined a metric for pattern deformation, i.e. the degree to which the transformation rotates or rescales the input patterns. As a proof of concept, we applied these metrics to an event-related fMRI data set consisting of four subjects that has been used in previous studies. We focused on the transformations from early visual cortex (EVC) to inferior temporal cortex (ITC), fusiform face area (FFA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA). Our results suggest that the estimated linear mappings are able to explain a significant amount of variance of the three output ROIs. The transformation from EVC to ITC shows the highest goodness-of-fit, and those from EVC to FFA and PPA show the expected preference for faces and places as well as animate and inanimate objects, respectively. The pattern transformations are sparse, but sparsity is lower than would have been expected for one-to-one mappings, thus suggesting the presence of one-to-few voxel mappings. ITC, FFA and PPA patterns are not simple rotations of an EVC pattern, indicating that the corresponding transformations amplify or dampen certain dimensions of the input patterns. While our results are only based on a small number of subjects, they show that our pattern transformation metrics can describe novel aspects of multivariate functional connectivity in neuroimaging data.",

FVE and Neuroticism mediated the association between the 5HTT-LPR and symptoms of anxiety (i.e., Cognitive Anxiety and Emotional Arousal Control). Also, Neuroticism was a mediator of the association between the 5HTT-LPR and FVE. Finally, FVE also mediated effects on the relationship between Neuroticism and symptoms of anxiety.

    "abstract": "Knowledge of cell type specific synaptic connectivity is a crucial prerequisite for understanding brain wide neuronal circuits. The functional investigation of long-range connections requires targeted recordings of single neurons combined with the specific stimulation of identified distant inputs. This is often difficult to achieve with conventional, electrical stimulation techniques, because axons from converging upstream brain areas may intermingle in the target region. The stereotaxic targeting of a specific brain region for virus-mediated expression of light sensitive ion channels allows to selectively stimulate axons coming from that region with light. Intracerebral stereotaxic injections can be used in well-delimited structures, such as the anterodorsal thalamic nuclei, and also in other subcortical or cortical areas throughout the brain.\\n\\nHere we describe a set of techniques for precise stereotaxic injection of viral vectors expressing channelrhodopsin in the anterodorsal thalamus, followed by photostimulation of their axon terminals in hippocampal slices. In combination with whole-cell patch clamp recording from a postsynaptically connected presubicular neuron, photostimulation of thalamic axons allows the detection of functional synaptic connections, their pharmacological characterization, and the evaluation of their strength in the brain slice preparation. We demonstrate that axons originating in the anterodorsal thalamus ramify densely in presubicular layers 1 and 3. The photostimulation of Chronos expressing thalamic axon terminals in presubiculum initiates short latency postsynaptic responses in a presubicular layer3 neuron, indicating a monosynaptic connection. In addition, biocytin filling of the recorded neuron and posthoc revelation confirms the layer localization and pyramidal morphology of the postsynaptic neuron. Taken together, the optogenetic stimulation of long-range inputs in ex vivo brain slices is a useful method to determine the cell-type specific functional connectivity from distant brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Arabidopsis root development is predicted to be regulated by yet unidentified carotenoid-derived metabolite(s). In this work, we screened known and putative carotenoid cleavage products and identified anchorene, a predicted carotenoid-derived dialdehyde (diapocarotenoid) that triggers anchor root development. Anchor roots are the least characterized type of root in Arabidopsis. They form at the root-shoot junction, particularly upon damage to the root apical meristem. Using Arabidopsis reporter lines, mutants and chemical inhibitors, we show that anchor roots originate from pericycle cells and that the development of this root type is auxin-dependent and requires carotenoid biosynthesis. Transcriptome analysis and treatment of auxin-reporter lines indicate that anchorene triggers anchor root development by modulating auxin homeostasis. Exogenous application of anchorene restored anchor root development in carotenoid-deficient plants, indicating that this compound is the carotenoid-derived signal required for anchor root development. Chemical modifications of anchorene led to a loss of anchor root promoting activity, suggesting that this compound is highly specific. Furthermore, we demonstrate by LC-MS analysis that anchorene is a natural, endogenous Arabidopsis metabolite. Taken together, our work reveals a new member of the family of carotenoid-derived regulatory metabolites and hormones.\\n\\nSignificanceUnknown carotenoid-derived compounds are predicted to regulate different aspects of plant development. Here, we characterize the development of anchor roots, the least characterized root type in Arabidopsis, and show that this process depends on auxin and requires a carotenoid-derived metabolite. We identified a presumed carotenoid-derivative, anchorene, as the likely, specific signal involved in anchor root formation. We further show that anchorene is a natural metabolite that occurs in Arabidopsis. Based on the analysis of auxin reporter lines and transcriptome data, we provide evidence that anchorene triggers the growth of anchor roots by modulating auxin homeostasis. Taken together, our work identifies a novel carotenoid-derived growth regulator with a specific developmental function.",

    "abstract": "Competence for genetic transformation allows the opportunistic human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae to take up exogenous DNA for incorporation into its own genome. This ability may account for the extraordinary genomic plasticity of this bacterium, leading to antigenic variation, vaccine escape, and the spread of antibiotic resistance markers. The competence system has been thoroughly studied and its regulation is well-understood. Additionally, over the last decade, several stress factors have been shown to trigger the competent state, leading to the activation of several stress response regulons. The arrival of next-generation sequencing techniques allowed us to update the competence regulon, the latest report of which still depended on DNA microarray technology. Enabled by the availability of an up-to-date genome annotation, including transcript boundaries, we assayed time-dependent expression of all annotated features in response to competence induction, were able to identify the affected promoters and produced a more complete overview of the various regulons activated during competence. We show that 4% of all annotated genes are under direct control of competence regulators ComE and ComX, while the expression of a total of up to 17% of all genes is, either directly or indirectly, affected. Among the affected genes are various small RNAs with an as-of-yet unknown function. Besides the ComE and ComX regulons, we were also able to refine the CiaR, VraR (LiaR) and BlpR regulons, underlining the strength of combining RNA-seq with a well-annotated genome.",

Current clinical methods reply on culture and take at least 16 h. Here, using P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. aureus as models, we show that the AST can be finished in 10 minutes by stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging of D2O metabolic activities. The metabolic incorporation of D2O, which is used for biomolecule synthesis, can be monitored in a single bacterium. Time lapse experiments show that the C-D vibrational signal can be observed in a single bacterium within 10 minutes culture in D2O medium. Since water is universally used for biosynthesis in bacteria, SRS imaging of D2O metabolism has the potential to be generalizable to different bacteria species.",

    "abstract": "The cell type composition of many biological tissues varies widely across samples. Such sample heterogeneity hampers efforts to probe the role of each cell type in the tissue microenvironment. Current approaches that address this issue have drawbacks. Cell sorting or single-cell based experimental techniques disrupt in situ interactions and alter physiological status of cells in tissues. Computational methods are flexible and promising; but they often estimate either sample-specific proportions of each cell type or cell-type-specific gene expression profiles, not both, by requiring the other as input. We introduce a computational Complete Deconvolution method that can estimate both sample-specific proportions of each cell type and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles simultaneously using bulk RNA-Seq data only (CDSeq). We assessed our methods performance using several synthetic and experimental mixtures of varied but known cell type composition and compared its performance to the performance of two state-of-the art deconvolution methods on the same mixtures. The results showed CDSeq can estimate both sample-specific proportions of each component cell type and cell-typespecificgene expression profiles with high accuracy. CDSeq holds promise for computationally deciphering complex mixtures of cell types, each with differing expression profiles, using RNA-seq data measured in bulk tissue (MATLAB code is available at https://github.com/kkang7/CDSeq_011).",

    "abstract": "Meningiomas are the most common brain tumor with a prevalence of 3% in the population. Histological grading of meningiomas (1 through 3) has a major role in determining treatment choice and predicting outcome. While largely indolent grade 1 and the highly aggressive grade 3 meningiomas as considered mostly homogenous in clinical behavior, atypical or grade 2 meningiomas have highly diverse biological properties. Our aim was to identify homogenous subgroups of atypical meningiomas with the working hypothesis that these subgroups would share features with grade 1 and grade 3 counterparts. We carried out systems level analysis by gene module discovery using co-expression networks on the transcriptomics of 212 meningiomas. The newly identified subgroups were characterized in terms of recurrence rate and overlapping biological processes in gene ontology. We were able to reclassify 33 of 46 atypical meningiomas (72%) into a benign \\\"grade 1-like\\\" (14/46) and malignant \\\"grade 3-like\\\" (19/46) subgroup based on oncogenic signatures. Recurrence rates of \\\"Grade 1-like\\\" and \\\"grade 3-like\\\" tumors was 0% and 72% respectively. These two new subgroups showed similar recurrence rates and concordant biological processes with the respected grades. Our findings help resolve the heterogeneity/uncertainty around atypical meningioma biology and identify subgroups more homogenous than in prior studies. These results may help reshape prediction, follow-up planning, treatment decisions and recruitment protocols for future and ongoing clinical trials. The findings demonstrate the conceptual advantage of systems biology approaches and underpin the utility of molecular signatures as complements to the current histological grading system.",

    "abstract": "Early mouse embryos have an atypical translational machinery comprised of cytoplasmic lattices, poorly competent for translation. Thus, the impact of transcriptomic changes on the operational levels of proteins has likely been overestimated in the past. To find out, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to detect and quantify 6,550 proteins in the oocyte and in six developmental stages (from zygote to blastocyst) collected in triplicates, and we also performed mRNA sequencing.\\n\\nIn contrast to the known split between the 2-cell and 4-cell stages at the transcript level, on the protein level the oocyte-to-embryo transition appeared to last until the morula stage. In general, protein abundance profiles were weakly correlated with those of their cognate mRNAs and we found little or no concordance between changes in protein and transcript expression relative to the oocyte at early stages. However, concordance increased towards morula and blastocyst, hinting at a more direct coupling of proteins with transcripts at these stages, in agreement with the increase in free ribosome abundance. Independent validation by immunofluorescence and qPCR confirmed the existence of genes featuring strongly positively and negatively correlated protein and transcript. Moreover, consistent coverage of most known protein complexes indicates that our dataset represents a large fraction of the expressed proteome. Finally, we identified 20 markers, including members of the endoplasmic reticulum pathway, for discriminating between early and late stages.\\n\\nThis resource contributes towards closing the gap between the  predicted phenotype, based on mRNA, and the  actual phenotype, based on protein, of the mouse embryo.",

    "abstract": "Genus Frankia is comprised primarily of nitrogen-fixing actinobacteria that form root nodule symbioses with a group of hosts known as the actinorhizal plants. These plants are evolutionarily closely related to the legumes, which are nodulated by the rhizobia. Both host groups utilize homologs of nodulation genes for root-nodule symbiosis, derived from common plant ancestors. However the corresponding endosymbionts, Frankia and the rhizobia, are distantly related groups of bacteria, leading to questions of their symbiotic mechanisms and evolutionary history. To date, a stable system of genetic transformation has been lacking in Frankia. Here, we report the successful electrotransformation of Frankia alni ACN14a, by means of replicating plasmids expressing chloramphenicol-resistance for selection, and the use of GFP as a marker of gene expression. We have identified type IV methyl-directed restriction systems, highly-expressed in a range of actinobacteria, as a likely barrier to Frankia transformation and circumvented this barrier by using unmethylated plasmids, which allowed the transformation of F. alni as well as the maintenance of the plasmid. During nitrogen limitation, Frankia differentiates into two cell types: the vegetative hyphae and nitrogen-fixing vesicles. When the plasmid transformation system was used with expression of egfp under the control of the nif gene cluster promoter, it was possible to demonstrate by fluorescence imaging the expression of nitrogen fixation in vesicles but not hyphae in nitrogen-limited culture.\\n\\nImportanceTo date, the study of Frankia-actinorhizal symbioses has been complicated by the lack of genetic tools for manipulation of Frankia, especially stable genetic transformation. The transformation system reported here, particularly coupled with marker genes, can be used to differentiate patterns of gene expression between Frankia hyphae and vesicles in symbiosis or in free-living conditions. This will enable deeper comparisons between Frankia-actinorhizal symbioses and rhizobia-legume symbioses in terms of molecular signaling and metabolic exchange that will broaden understanding of the evolution of these symbioses and potentially make possible their application in agriculture. The development of transformation methods will allow further down-stream applications including gene knock-outs and complementation that will, in turn, open up a much broader range of experiments into Frankia and its symbioses.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe gene expression profile of a cell dictates its function in molecular processes, and can be used to probe its health status. This represents a step forward in the deep characterization of diseases such as cancer and may lead to breakthroughs in their treatment. The technology used to measure the gene expression of isolated cells, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), has emerged in the last decade as a key enabler of this progress. However, the use of existing methods for dimensionality reduction, clustering and differential expression is limited by the specificities of the data obtained from scRNA-seq experiments, where technical factors may confound analyses of the true biological signal and contribute to spurious results. To overcome this issue, a possible approach is designing probabilistic generative models of the data with hidden variables encoding different underlying processes.\\n\\nResultsWe propose two novel probabilistic models for scRNA-seq data: modified probabilistic count matrix factorization (m-pCMF) and Bayesian zero-inflated negative binomial factorization (ZINBayes). These build upon previous models in the literature while leveraging scalable Bayesian inference via variational methods. We show that the proposed methods are competitive with the state-of-the-art models for robust dimensionality reduction in modern data sets, and improve upon the current best Bayesian model for small numbers of cells. The results show that building probabilistic models of latent variables which encode domain knowledge and using variational inference constitute a promising approach to analyse scRNA-seq data in a scalable way.\\n\\nAvailabilitym-pCMF and ZINBayes are publicly available as Python packages at https://github.com/pedrofale/, along with the code to reproduce all the results.\\n\\nContactsusanavinga@tecnico.ulisboa.pt",

In response, those aged 14 months and 14 years are vaccinated with the conjugated MenACWY vaccine. In the spring of 2018 we aimed to explore the impact of adding a one-off catch-up campaign targeting those aged 15-18 years on the transmission of MenW and the cost-effectiveness of such a campaign.\\n\\nMethodsWe estimated the growth rate of the MenW outbreak and quantified the impact of various targeted vaccination strategies on the reproductive number, and subsequently projected the future incidence with and without vaccination. Future cases were expressed in costs and QALYS and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was obtained.\\n\\nResultsWe estimate a reproductive number of around 1.4 (95%CI 1.2-1.7) over the period February 2016-February 2018. Adding the catch-up campaign reduces the reproductive number five years earlier than without a catch-up campaign, to a level around 1.2. The vaccination campaign, including the catch-up, will prevent around 100 cases per year in our base case scenario. Given the projected impact and realistic assumptions on costs and QALYs, adding the catch-up can be considered cost-effective using a threshold of {euro}20,000 per QALY.\\n\\nConclusionAdding the catch-up campaign targeting those aged 15-18 brings the impact of vaccination on reducing transmission five years forward and directly prevents a high-incidence age group from carriage and disease. Such a campaign can be considered cost-effective. Our study did underpin the decision to introduce a catch-up campaign in spring 2019. Furthermore, our applied method can be of interest for anyone solving vaccine allocation questions in a developing outbreak.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundApproximately 70% of the global burden of dengue disease occurs on the Asian continent, where many large urban centres provide optimal environments for sustained endemic transmission and periodic epidemic cycles. Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, is a densely populated megacity with hyperendemic dengue transmission. Characterization of the spatiotemporal distribution of dengue transmission intensity is of key importance for optimal implementation of novel control and prevention programmes, including vaccination. In this paper we use mathematical models to provide the first detailed description of spatial and temporal variability in dengue transmission in Jakarta.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal FindingsWe applied catalytic models in a Bayesian framework to age-stratified dengue case notification data to estimate dengue force of infection and reporting probabilities in 42 subdistricts of Jakarta. The model was fit to yearly and average annual data covering a 10- year period between 2008 and 2017. We estimated a long-term average annual transmission intensity of 13.0% (95%CrI: 12.9-13.1%) per year in Jakarta province, ranging from 9.0% (95%CrI: 7.7-10.3%) to 16.4% (95%CrI: 15.3-17.4%) across subdistricts. Annual average transmission intensity in Jakarta province during the 10-year period ranged from 1.2% (95%CrI: 1.1-1.3%) in 2017 to 12.4% (95%CrI: 12.1-12.8%) in 2016.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceWhile the absolute number of dengue case notifications cannot be relied upon as a measure of endemicity, the age-distribution of reported dengue cases provides valuable insights into the underlying nature of transmission. Our estimates from yearly and average annual case notification data represent the first detailed estimates of dengue transmission intensity in Jakartas subdistricts, which will be important to consider when assessing the population-level impact and cost-effectiveness of potential control and prevention programmes in Jakarta province, such as the controlled release of Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes and vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Here, we report the first confirmed autochthonous tick-borne encephalitis case diagnosed in Moscow in 2016 and describe the detection of Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in ticks and small mammals in a Moscow park.\\n\\nThe paper includes data from two patients who were bitten by TBEV-infected ticks within the Moscow city limits; one of these cases led to the development of the meningeal form of TBE. Both TBEV-infected ticks attacked patients in the same area. We collected ticks and trapped small mammals in this area in 2017. All samples were screened for the presence of pathogens causing tick-borne diseases by PCR. The TBEV-positive ticks and small mammals tissue samples were subjected to virus isolation. The sequencing of the complete polyprotein gene of the positive samples was performed.\\n\\nA total of 227 questing ticks were collected. TBEV was detected in five specimens of Ixodes ricinus. We trapped 44 small mammals, mainly bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and pygmy field mice (Apodemus uralensis). Two samples of brain tissue from bank voles yielded a positive signal in RT-PCR for TBEV. We obtained six virus isolates from the ticks and brain tissue of a bank vole. Complete genome sequencing showed that the obtained isolates belong to the European subtype and have low diversity with sequence identities as high as 99.9%. GPS tracking showed that the maximum distance between the exact locations where the TBEV-positive ticks were collected was 185 m. We assume that the forest park was free of TBEV and that the virus was recently introduced.",

    "abstract": "Searching tandem mass spectra against a peptide database requires accurate knowledge of various experimental parameters, including machine settings and details of the sample preparation protocol. In some cases, such as in re-analysis of public data sets, this experimental metadata may be missing or inaccurate. We describe a method for automatically inferring the presence of various types of modifications, including stable-isotope and isobaric labeling, tandem mass tags, and phosphorylation, directly from a given set of mass spectra. We demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed approach, and we provide open source Python and C++ implementations in a new version of the software tool Param-Medic.",

    "abstract": "OsSPL14, identified as IDEAL PLANT ARCHITECTURE1 (IPA1) or WEALTHY FARMERS PANICLE (WFP) gene, plays a critical role in regulating rice plant architecture. Here, the study showed that OsSPL14-overexpression transgenic rice plants had shorter growth period, short-narrow flag leaves, and thick-green leaves. Compared with wild type plant  MH86, transgenic plants had higher chlorophyll a (Ca), chlorophyll b (Cb) and carotenoid (Cx) content at both seedling and maturity stage. Meanwhile, transcriptome analysis identified 473 up-regulated and 103 down-regulated genes in transgenic plant. The expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in carotenoid biosynthesis, abscisic acid (ABA) metabolism and lignin biosynthesis increased significantly. Most of DEGs participated in \\\"plant hormone signal transduction\\\" and \\\"starch and sucrose metabolism\\\" are also up-regulated in transgenic plant. In addition, there were higher levels of ABA and gibberellin acid (GA3) in OsSPL14-overexpression transgenic plants. Moreover, the content of culm lignin, cellulose, silicon and potassium all increased dramatically. Thus, these results demonstrate that overexpression of OsSPL14 has influence on leaf development, hormone level and culm composition in rice, which provide more insight into understanding the function of OsSPL14.\\n\\nHighlightOsSPL14-overexpression transgenic plants showed shorter growth period, short-narrow flag leaves, and thick-green leaves. Transcript profile, abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin acid (GA3) level, and culm composition also changed obviously.",

    "abstract": "Loss of sensory hair cells leads to deafness and balance deficiencies. In contrast to mammalian hair cells, zebrafish ear and lateral line hair cells regenerate from poorly characterized, proliferating support cells. Equally ill-defined is the gene regulatory network underlying the progression of support cells to cycling hair cell progenitors and differentiated hair cells. We used single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) of lateral line sensory organs and uncovered five different support cell types, including quiescent and activated stem cells. In silico ordering of support cells along a developmental trajectory identified cells that self-renew and new groups of genes required for hair cell differentiation. scRNA-Seq analyses of fgf3 mutants, in which hair cell regeneration is increased, demonstrates that Fgf and Notch signaling inhibit proliferation of support cells in parallel by inhibiting Wnt signaling. Our scRNA-Seq analyses set the foundation for mechanistic studies of sensory organ regeneration and is crucial for identifying factors to trigger hair cell production in mammals. As a resource, we implemented a shiny application that allows the community to interrogate cell type specific expression of genes of interest.",

    "abstract": "Retinal ganglion cells (RGC), together with cone photoreceptors, horizontal cells (HC) and amacrine cells (AC), are the first classes of neurons produced in the retina. Here we have profiled 5348 single retinal cells and provided a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas showing the broad diversity of the developing retina at the time when the four early-born cells are being produced. Our results show the transcriptional sequences that establish the hierarchical ordering of early cell fate specification in the retina. RGC maturation follows six waves of gene expression, giving new insight into the regulatory logic of RGC differentiation. Early-generated RGCs transcribe an increasing amount of guidance cues for young peripheral RGC axons that express the matching receptors. Finally, spatial signatures in sub-populations of RGCs allowed to define novel molecular markers that are spatially restricted during the development of the retina. Altogether this study is a valuable resource that identifies new players in mouse retinal development, shedding light on transcription factors sequence and guidance cues dynamics in space and time.",

    "abstract": "Sensorimotor information processing that underlies normal cognitive and behavioral traits is dysregulated across a subset of neurological and psychiatric disorders. The cross-disease deficit in sensorimotor gating poses a unique opportunity to integrate hierarchical findings at molecular, cellular, through circuitry levels to obtain an in-depth mechanistic understanding of this process that contributes to brain physiology and pathophysiology beyond categorical segmentation of brain disorders. Based on circuitry recording with wild-type mice, we demonstrated that the cortico-striatal projection mediates sensorimotor gating responses during prepulse inhibition (PPI) task. We also found that these circuitry responses were disrupted in Disc1 locus-impairment (LI) mice, a model representing neuropsychiatric conditions. Thus, we hypothesized that Disc1-mediated molecular and cellular machinery along the cortico-striatal circuit may regulate sensorimotor gating. Anatomical and biochemical analyses of Disc1-LI mice revealed attenuated Bdnf transport along the cortico-striatal circuit. Pharmacologically augmenting Bdnf transport by chronic lithium administration, in part via Ser-421 phosphorylation of Huntingtin (Htt) and its integration into the motor machinery, restored the striatal Bdnf levels and PPI deficits in Disc1-LI mice, suggesting that the Bdnf transport attenuation mechanistically underlies the circuitry and behavioral deficits. These results also shed light on a novel mechanism and utility of lithium that is currently used as a major mood stabilizer in clinical settings. Collectively, the present study illustrates integrative biological mechanisms for sensorimotor gating, underscoring the cross-disease nature of this behavioral dimension and translational utility of the findings under the era of precision medicine in brain disorders.",
