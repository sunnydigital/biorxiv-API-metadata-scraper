    "abstract": "In the context of genomic selection, we evaluated and compared recurrent selection breeding programs using either index selection or independent culling for selection of parents. We simulated a clonally propagated crop breeding program for 20 cycles of selection using either independent culling or an economic selection index with two unfavourably correlated traits under selection. Cycle time from crossing to selection of parents was kept the same for both strategies. Our results demonstrate that accurate knowledge of the economic importance of traits is essential even when performing independent culling. This is because independent culling achieved its optimum genetic gain when the culling threshold for each trait varied accordingly to the economic importance of the traits. When gains from independent culling were maximised, the efficiency of converting genetic diversity into genetic gain of both selection methods were equivalent. When the same proportion selected of 10% for each trait was used instead of optimal culling levels, index selection was 10%, 128% and 310% more efficient than independent culling when T2 had a relative economic importance of 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0, respectively. Given the complexity of estimating optimal culling levels and the fact that the gains achieved with independent culling are, at most, equivalent to index selection, the use of an economic selection index is recommended for multi-trait genomic selection.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder resulting from germline mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes neurofibromin. Patients experience a variety of symptoms, but pain in the context of NF1 remains largely underrecognized. Here, we characterize nociceptive signaling and pain behaviors in a miniswine harboring a disruptive NF1 mutation (exon 42 deletion). We explore these phenotypes in relationship to collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), a known interactor of neurofibromin. Mechanistically, we found two previously unknown phosphorylated residues of CRMP2 in NF1+/ex42del pig dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and replicated increased voltage-gated calcium channel currents in NF1+/ex42del pig DRGs previously described in rodent models of NF1. We present the first characterization of pain-related behaviors in a pig model of NF1, identifying unchanged agitation scores, lower tactile thresholds (allodynia), and decreased response latencies to thermal laser stimulation (hyperalgesia) in the NF1 mutant animals; NF1+/ex42del pigs demonstrated sexually dimorphic behaviors. NF1+/ex42del pigs showed reduced sleep quality and increased resting, two health-related quality of life symptoms found to be comorbid in people with NF1 pain. Finally, we show decreased depolarization-evoked calcium influx in both wildtype and NF1+/ex42del pig DRGs treated with CRMP2 phosphorylation inhibitor (5)-lacosamide. Our data supports use of NF1+/ex42del pigs as an ideal model for studying NF1-associated pain and are a better model for understanding the pathophysiology of NF1 compared to rodents. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that interfering with CRMP2 phosphorylation might be a promising therapeutic strategy for NF1-related pain management.",

    "abstract": "Imprinted genes are highly expressed in monoaminergic regions of the midbrain and their functions in this area are thought to have an impact on mammalian social behaviors. One such imprinted gene is Grb10, of which the paternal allele is currently recognized as mediating social dominance behavior. However, there has been no detailed study of social dominance in Grb10+/p mice. Moreover, the original study examined tube-test behavior in isolated mice 10 months of age. Isolation testing favors more territorial and aggressive behaviors, and does not address social dominance strategies employed in group housing contexts. Furthermore, isolation stress impacts midbrain function and dominance related behavior, often through alterations in monoaminergic signaling. Thus, we undertook a systematic study of Grb10+/p social rank and dominance behavior within the cage group, using a number of convergent behavioral tests. We examined both male and female mice to account for sex differences, and tested cohorts aged 2, 6, and 10 months to examine any developments related to age. We found group-housed Grb10+/p mice do not show evidence of enhanced social dominance, but cages containing Grb10+/p and wildtype mice lacked the normal correlation between three different measures of social rank. Moreover, a separate study indicated isolation stress induced inconsistent changes in tube test behavior. Taken together, these data suggest future research on Grb10+/p mice should focus on social stability, rather than dominance per se.",

We also reported some specificities in terms of brain oscillations. The sustained attention to response task was applied combined with electrophysiological recordings in 59 adults, aged from 19 to 86 years. We used a hierarchical cluster analysis to group individuals based on similarity of levels and patterns of performance across variables of interest. We focused on the most common attentional-related variables, which allowed us to identify four distinct clusters showing specific sustained attention profiles. Furthermore, our analysis clearly revealed that age was not the determinant factor of these profiles. Finally, we highlighted specificities in terms of brain oscillations. Subjects from cluster 1- the \\\"high-performers\\\" - demonstrated a globally increased theta-gamma coupling maintained over time and an increase of theta activity at the FC6 and F8 electrodes. Subjects from cluster 2, who adopted a more cautious response strategy, presented a higher level of modulation exerted by the electrode FT7 over Oz and a higher theta-gamma coupling at the Oz.

    "abstract": "When data are not normally distributed (e.g. skewed, zero-inflated, binomial, or count data) researchers are often uncertain whether it may be legitimate to use tests that assume Gaussian errors (e.g. regression, t-test, ANOVA, Gaussian mixed models), or whether one has to either model a more specific error structure or use randomization techniques.Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the pros and cons of fitting Gaussian models to non-normal data in terms of risk of type I error, power and utility for parameter estimation.We find that Gaussian models are remarkably robust to non-normality over a wide range of conditions, meaning that P-values remain fairly reliable except for data with influential outliers judged at strict alpha levels. Gaussian models also perform well in terms of power and they can be useful for parameter estimation but usually not for extrapolation. Transformation of data before analysis is often advisable and visual inspection for outliers and heteroscedasticity is important for assessment. In strong contrast, some non-Gaussian models and randomization techniques bear a range of risks that are often insufficiently known. High rates of false-positive conclusions can arise for instance when overdispersion in count data is not controlled appropriately or when randomization procedures ignore existing non-independencies in the data.Overall, we argue that violating the normality assumption bears risks that are limited and manageable, while several more sophisticated approaches are relatively error prone and difficult to check during peer review. Hence, as long as scientists and reviewers are not fully aware of the risks, science might benefit from preferentially trusting Gaussian mixed models in which random effects account for non-independencies in the data in a transparent way.Tweetable abstract Gaussian models are remarkably robust to even dramatic violations of the normality assumption.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

We present EmbedSOM, a non-linear embedding algorithm based on FlowSOM that improves the analyses by providing high-performance visualization of complex single cell distributions within cellular populations and their transition states. The algorithm is designed for linear scaling and speed suitable for interactive analyses of millions of cells without downsampling. At the same time, the visualization quality is competitive with current state-of-art algorithms. We demonstrate the properties of EmbedSOM on workflows that improve two essential types of analyses: The native ability of EmbedSOM to align population positions in embedding is used for comparative analysis of multi-sample data, and the connection to FlowSOM is exploited for simplifying the supervised hierarchical dissection of cell populations. Additionally, we discuss the visualization of the trajectories between cellular states facilitated by the local linearity of the embedding.",

    "abstract": "The popularity of CRISPR-based gene editing has resulted in an abundance of tools to design CRISPR-Cas9 guides. This is also driven by the fact that designing highly specific and efficient guides is a crucial, but not trivial, task in using CRISPR for gene editing. Here, we thoroughly analyse the performance of 17 design tools. They are evaluated based on runtime performance, compute requirements, and guides generated. To achieve this, we implemented a method for auditing system resources while a given tool executes, and tested each tool on datasets of increasing size, derived from the mouse genome. We found that only five tools had a computational performance that would allow them to analyse an entire genome in a reasonable time, and without exhausting computing resources. There was wide variation in the guides identified, with some tools reporting every possible guide while others filtered for predicted efficiency. Some tools also failed to exclude guides that would target multiple positions in the genome. We also considered a collection of over a thousand guides for which experimental data is available. For the tools that attempt to filter based on efficiency, 65% to 85% of the guides they reported were experimentally found to be efficient, but with limited overlap in the sets produced by different tools. Our results show that CRISPR-Cas9 guide design tools need further work in order to achieve rapid whole-genome analysis and that improvements in guide design will likely require combining multiple approaches.",

As such, we aimed to investigate the influence of P1P on oocyte maturation during porcine in vitro maturation (IVM). Here we report the expression of S1PR1-3 among P1P receptors (S1PR1-4) in cumulus cells and oocytes. When P1P was treated by concentrations 10 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM, and 1000 nM during IVM, Metaphase II rate was significantly increased in 1000 nM (=1 M) P1P treatment group. Maturation rate improvement by P1P supplementation was only observed in the presence of EGF. Oocytes under the influence of P1P decreased intracellular ROS levels yet did not show significant differences in GSH levels. In our molecular studies, P1P treatment up-regulated gene expressions involved in cumulus expansion (Has2 and EGF), antioxidant enzyme (SOD3 and Cat), and developmental competence (Oct4) while activating ERK1/2 and Akt signaling. P1P treatment also influenced oocyte survival by shifting the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax, while inactivating JNK signaling. We further demonstrated that oocytes matured with P1P significantly displayed not only higher developmental competence (cleavage and blastocyst formation rate), but also greater blastocyst quality (total cell number and the ratio of apoptotic cells) when activated via parthenogenetic activation (PA) and in vitro fertilization (IVF). Despite low levels of endogenous P1P found in animals, exogenous P1P was able to influence animal reproduction as shown by increased porcine oocyte maturation as well as preimplantation embryo development.",

    "abstract": "In many species, sperm can remain viable in the reproductive tract of a female well beyond the typical interval to remating. This creates an opportunity for sperm from different males to compete for oocyte fertilization inside the females reproductive tract. In Drosophila melanogaster, sperm morphology and seminal fluid content affect male success in sperm competition. On the other hand, although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have demonstrated that female genotype plays a role in sperm competition outcome as well, the biochemical, sensory and physiological processes by which females detect and selectively use sperm from different males remain elusive.\\n\\nHere, we functionally tested 27 candidate genes implicated via a GWAS for their contribution to the females role in sperm competition, measured as changes in the relative success of the first male to mate (P1). Of these 27 candidates, we identified eight genes that affect P1 when knocked down in females, and also showed that six of them do so when knocked down in the female nervous system. Two genes in particular, Rim and caup, lowered P1 when knocked down in sensory pickpocket (ppk)+ neurons and octopaminergic Tdc2+ neurons, respectively. These results establish a functional role for the females nervous system in the process of sperm competition and expand our understanding of the genetic, neuronal and mechanistic basis of female responses to multiple matings. We propose that through their nervous system, females actively assess male compatibility based on courtship or ejaculates and modulate sperm competition outcome accordingly.",

    "abstract": "A primary limitation to real-time imaging of metabolites and proteins has been the selective detection of biomolecules that have no naturally-occurring or stable molecular recognition counterparts. We present developments in the design of synthetic near-infrared fluorescent nanosensors based on the fluorescence modulation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) with select sequences of surface-adsorbed N-substituted glycine peptoid polymers. We assess the stability of the peptoid-SWNT nanosensor candidates under variable ionic strengths, protease exposure, and cell culture media conditions, and find that the stability of peptoid-SWNTs depends on the composition and length of the peptoid polymer. From our library, we identify a peptoid-SWNT assembly that can selectively detect lectin protein wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) with a sensitivity comparable to the concentration of serum proteins. This WGA protein nanosensor is characterized with near-infrared spectroscopy and microscopy to study protein-nanosensor interaction parameters. To demonstrate the retention of nanosensor-bound protein activity, we show that WGA on the nanosensor produces an additional fluorescent signal modulation upon exposure to the lectins conjugate sugars, suggesting the lectin protein selectively binds its target sugars through ternary molecular recognition interactions relayed to the nanosensor. Our results inform design considerations for developing synthetic molecular recognition elements by assembling peptoid polymers on SWNTs, and also demonstrate these assemblies can serve as optical nanosensors for lectin proteins and their target sugars. Together, these data suggest certain peptoid sequences can be assembled with SWNTs to serve as versatile optical probes to detect proteins and their molecular substrates.",

Using this approach, we identify 77 genes at 38 GWAS loci, with most loci harboring 1-2 candidate genes. Importantly, the hit set was strongly enriched for genes validated through orthogonal genetic approaches. Genes identified by this approach are enriched in specific and relevant biological pathways, allowing regulators of human erythropoiesis and modifiers of blood diseases to be defined. More generally, this functional screen provides a paradigm for gene-centric follow up of GWAS for a variety of human diseases and traits.",

    "abstract": "Flowers are composed of different organs, whose identity is defined at the molecular by the combinatorial activity of transcription factors (TFs). MADS-box TFs interact forming complexes that have been schematized in the quartet model. The gynoecium is the female reproductive part in the flower, crucial for plant reproduction, and fruit and seed production. Once carpel identity is established, a gynoecium containing many tissues arises. Several TFs have been identified as regulators of gynoecium development, and some of these TFs form complexes. However, broad knowledge about the interactions among these TFs is still scarce. In this work, we used a systems biology approach to understand the formation of a complex reproductive unit as the gynoecium by mapping binary interactions between well-characterized TFs. We analyzed over 3500 combinations and detected more than 200 protein-protein interactions (PPIs), resulting in a process specific interaction map. Topological analyses suggest hidden functions and novel roles for many TFs. Furthermore, a relationship between TFs involved in auxin and cytokinin signaling pathways and other TFs was observed. We analyzed the network by combining PPI data, expression and genetic data, allowing us to dissect it into several dynamic spatio-temporal sub-networks related to gynoecium development subprocesses.",

    "abstract": "Life-history theory states that, during the lifetime of an individual, resources are allocated to either somatic maintenance or reproduction. Resource allocation trade-offs determine the evolution and ecology of life-history strategies and determine an organisms position along the fast-slow continuum. Theory predicts that environmental stochasticity is an important driver of resource allocation and therefore life-history evolution. Highly stochastic environments are expected to increase uncertainty in reproductive success and select for iteroparity and a slowing down of the life history. To date, most empirical studies have used comparisons among species to examine these theoretical predictions. By contrast, few have investigated how environmental stochasticity affects life-history strategies at the intraspecific level. In this study, we examined how variation in breeding site stochasticity (among-year variability in pond volume and hydroperiod) promotes the co-occurrence of different life-history strategies in a spatially structured population, and determines life-history position along the fast-slow continuum in the yellow-bellied toad (Bombina variegata). We collected mark-recapture data from a metapopulation and used multievent capture-recapture models to estimate survival, recruitment and breeding probabilities. We found higher survival and longer lifespans in populations inhabiting variable sites compared to those breeding in stable ones. In addition, probabilities of recruitment and skipping a breeding event were higher in variable sites. The temporal variance of survival and recruitment probabilities as well as the probability to skip breeding was higher in variable sites. Taken together, these findings indicate that populations breeding in variable sites experienced a slowing down of the life-history. Our study thus revealed similarities in the macroevolutionary and microevolutionary processes shaping life-history evolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPredicting the evolutionary potential of natural tree populations requires the estimation of heritability and genetic correlations among traits on which selection acts, as differences in evolutionary success between species may rely on differences for these genetic parameters. In situ estimates are expected to be more accurate than measures done under controlled conditions which do not reflect the natural environmental variance.\\n\\nAimsThe aim of the current study was to estimate three genetic parameters (i.e. heritability, evolvability and genetic correlations) in a natural mixed oak stand composed of Quercus petraea and Quercus robur about 100 years old, for 58 traits of ecological and functional relevance (growth, reproduction, phenology, physiology, resilience, structure, morphology and defence).\\n\\nMethodsFirst we estimated genetic parameters directly in situ using realized genomic relatedness of adult trees and parentage relationships over two generations to estimate the traits additive variance. Secondly, we benefited from existing ex situ experiments (progeny tests and conservation collection) installed with the same populations, thus allowing comparisons of in situ heritability estimates with more traditional methods.\\n\\nResultsHeritability and evolvability estimates obtained with different methods varied substantially and showed large confidence intervals, however we found that in situ were less precise than ex situ esti-mates, and assessments over two generations (with deeper relatedness) improved estimates of heritability while large sampling sizes are needed for accurate estimations. At the biological level, heritability values varied moderately across different ecological and functional categories of traits, and genetic correlations among traits were conserved over the two species.\\n\\nConclusionWe identified limits for using realized genomic relatedness in natural stands to estimate the genetic variance, given the overall low variance of genetic relatedness and the rather low sampling sizes of currently used long term genetic plots in forestry. These limits can be overcome if larger sample sizes are considered, or if the approach is extended over the next generation.",

Recombinant native-like soluble Env trimer mimetics, such as SOSIP trimers, have taken a central role in HIV-1 vaccine research aimed at inducing bNAbs. We therefore performed a direct and thorough comparison of a full-length native Env trimer containing the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail, with the sequence matched soluble SOSIP trimer, both based on an early Env sequence (AMC011) from an HIV+ individual that developed bNAbs. The structures of the full-length AMC011 trimer bound to either bNAb PGT145 or PGT151 were very similar to the structures of SOSIP trimers. Antigenically, the full-length and SOSIP trimers were comparable, but in contrast to the full-length trimer, the SOSIP trimer did not bind at all to non-neutralizing antibodies, most likely as a consequence of the intrinsic stabilization of the SOSIP trimer. Furthermore, the glycan composition of full-length and SOSIP trimers was similar overall, but the SOSIP trimer possessed slightly less complex and less extensively processed glycans, which may relate to the intrinsic stabilization as well as the absence of the membrane tether. These data provide insights into how to best use and improve membrane-associated full-length and soluble SOSIP HIV-1 Env trimers as immunogens.",

    "abstract": "The increasing size and diversity of genome-wide association studies provide an exciting opportunity to study how the genetics of complex traits vary among diverse populations. Here, we introduce covariate-adjusted LD score regression (cov-LDSC), a method to accurately estimate genetic heritability [Formula] and its enrichment in both homogenous and admixed populations with summary statistics and in-sample LD estimates. In-sample LD can be estimated from a subset of the GWAS samples, allowing our method to be applied efficiently to very large cohorts. In simulations, we show that unadjusted LDSC underestimates [Formula] by 10% - 60% in admixed populations; in contrast, cov-LDSC is robust to all simulation parameters. We apply cov-LDSC to genotyping data from approximately 170,000 Latino, 47,000 African American and 135,000 European individuals. We estimate [Formula] and detect heritability enrichment in three quantitative and five dichotomous phenotypes respectively, making this, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive heritability-based analysis of admixed individuals. Our results show that most traits have high concordance of [Formula] and consistent tissue-specific heritability enrichment among different populations. However, for age at menarche, we observe population-specific heritability estimates of [Formula]. We observe consistent patterns of tissue-specific heritability enrichment across populations; for example, in the limbic system for BMI, the per-standardized-annotation effect size{tau} * is 0.16 {+/-} 0.04, 0.28 {+/-} 0.11 and 0.18 {+/-} 0.03 in Latino, African American and European populations respectively. Our results demonstrate that our approach is a powerful way to analyze genetic data for complex traits from underrepresented populations.\n\nAuthor summaryAdmixed populations such as African Americans and Hispanic Americans bear a disproportionately high burden of disease but remain underrepresented in current genetic studies. It is important to extend current methodological advancements for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits in homogeneous populations to individuals with admixed genetic backgrounds. Here, we develop a computationally efficient method to answer two specific questions. First, does genetic variation contribute to the same amount of phenotypic variation (heritability) across diverse populations? Second, are the genetic mechanisms shared among different populations? To answer these questions, we use our novel method to conduct the first comprehensive heritability-based analysis of a large number of admixed individuals. We show that there is a high degree of concordance in total heritability and tissue-specific enrichment between different ancestral groups. However, traits such as age at menarche show a noticeable differences among populations. Our work provides a powerful way to analyze genetic data in admixed populations and may contribute to the applicability of genomic medicine to admixed population groups.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is highly prevalent worldwide, with a significant socioeconomic burden, and also contributes to excess mortality. Chronic pain is a complex trait that is moderately heritable and genetically, as well as phenotypically, correlated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Use of the Conditional False Discovery Rate (cFDR) approach, which leverages pleiotropy identified from existing GWAS outputs, has been successful in discovering novel associated variants in related phenotypes. Here, genome-wide association study outputs for both von Korff chronic pain grade as a quasi-quantitative trait and for MDD were used to identify variants meeting a cFDR threshold for each outcome phenotype separately, as well as a conjunctional cFDR (ccFDR) threshold for both phenotypes together. Using a moderately conservative threshold, we identified a total of 11 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), six of which were associated with chronic pain grade and nine of which were associated with MDD. Four SNPs on chromosome 14 were associated with both chronic pain grade and MDD. SNPs associated only with chronic pain grade were located within SLC16A7 on chromosome 12. SNPs associated only with MDD were located either in a gene-dense region on chromosome 1 harbouring LINC01360, LRRIQ3, FPGT and FPGT-TNNI3K, or within/close to LRFN5 on chromosome 14. The SNPs associated with both outcomes were also located within LRFN5. Several of the SNPs on chromosomes 1 and 14 were identified as being associated with expression levels of nearby genes in the brain and central nervous system. Overall, using the cFDR approach, we identified several novel genetic loci associated with chronic pain and we describe likely pleiotropic effects of a recently identified MDD locus on chronic pain.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGenetic variants explaining variation in complex traits can often be associated with more than one trait at once ( pleiotropy). Taking account of this pleiotropy in genetic studies can increase power to find sites in the genome harbouring trait-associated variants. In this study we used the suspected underlying pleiotropy between chronic pain and major depressive disorder to discover novel variants associated with chronic pain, and to investigate genetic variation that may be shared between the two disorders.",

    "abstract": "The brain is constantly challenged by severely destabilizing forces: proteins turn over rapidly, Hebbian modifications alter and introduce positive feedback into networks, and environments change over many timescales. Homeostatic plasticity mechanisms, which operate via negative feedback, are believed to compensate for these changes and constrain neuronal activity to a firing rate (FR) set point1,2,3. For decades, it has been widely assumed that activity in neural networks is robust as a direct result of the widespread expression of FR homeostasis1,4. Here we reveal that network dynamics are stabilized independent of excitatory FR homeostasis and that cortical networks actively self-organize around an ideal computational regime.\\n\\nWe continuously tracked network spiking activity in the visual cortex (V1) of freely behaving rats for nine days. We found that, under baseline conditions, networks of excitatory neurons are robustly organized around criticality, a regime known to maximize information capacity and dynamic range. Monocular deprivation (MD) revealed a dissociation of excitatory FRs and network dynamics. MD immediately and severely disrupted network organization, which returned precisely to criticality over 48h. In contrast, both the excitatory FR drop and the subsequent FR recovery trailed the timecourse of network changes by more than 30h. Model investigations suggest a role for inhibitory neurons in maintaining critical dynamics. Collectively, these results show that complex activity in cortical circuits is actively maintained near criticality and that this organization is not explained by previously identified mechanisms of pyramidal neuron FR homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Human activities alter processes that control local biodiversity, causing changes in the abundance and identity of species in many ecosystems. However, restoring biodiversity to a previous state is rarely as simple as reintroducing lost species or restoring processes to their pre-disturbance state. Theory suggests that established species can impede shifts in species composition via a variety of mechanisms, including direct interference (e.g. territoriality), preempting resources, or habitat alteration. Here we use a long-term experimental manipulation of a desert rodent community to examine differences in the recolonization dynamics of a dominant competitor (kangaroo rats of the genus Dipodomys) when patches were already occupied by an existing rodent community relative to when patches were empty. Recovery of kangaroo rat populations was slow on plots with an established community of other rodent species, taking approximately two years. In contrast, recovery of kangaroo rat populations was rapid on empty plots with no established residents (approximately 3 months). We found little evidence that the delay in kangaroo rat colonization was due to direct interference from competitors, or could be explained by differences in habitat, implicating resource preemption by the established community as the most likely mechanism. These results demonstrate that the presence of an established alternate community inhibits recolonization by new species, even those that should be dominant in the community. This has important implications for understanding how biodiversity may change in the future, and what processes may slow or prevent this change.\\n\\nSignificance statementEcological communities are changing due to human activities altering the processes governing local biodiversity. However restoring these processes often fails to restore the previous biodiversity state, implying that additional mechanisms contribute to community dynamics. Here we use an experimental manipulation of a desert rodent community--in which dominant competitors (kangaroo rats) were removed and then reintroduced years later--to show that the presence of previously-established species alters the dynamics of the dominant competitors recovery. Kangaroo rat populations took two years to recover on patches where inferior competitors were already established, compared to three months on uninhabited patches. This suggests that priority effects and initial conditions are critical to consider when predicting community response to disturbance, or in ecological restoration projects.",

It has been proposed that these attractive biases help perception stabilization in the face of correlated natural scene statistics as an adaptive mechanism, although this remains mostly theoretical. Color, which is strongly correlated in natural scenes, has never been studied with regard to its serial dependencies. Here, we found significant serial dependence in 6 out of 7 datasets with behavioral data of humans (total n=111) performing delayed-estimation of color with uncorrelated sequential stimuli. Consistent with a drifting memory model, serial dependence was stronger when referenced relative to previous report, rather than to previous stimulus. In addition, it built up through the experimental session, suggesting metaplastic mechanisms operating at a slower time scale than previously proposed (e.g. short-term synaptic facilitation). Because, in contrast with natural scenes, stimuli were temporally uncorrelated, this build-up casts doubt on serial dependencies being an ongoing adaptation to the stable statistics of the environment.",

Following this assumption, midfrontal theta oscillations have recently been proposed to temporally organize brain computations during conflict processing. Using a multivariate analysis approach, we show that brain-behavior relationships during conflict tasks are modulated according to the phase of ongoing endogenous midfrontal theta oscillations recorded by scalp EEG. We found reproducible results in two independent datasets, using two different conflict tasks: brain-behavior relationships (correlation between reaction time and theta power) were theta phase-dependent in a subject-specific manner, and these \\\"behaviorally optimal\\\" theta phases were also associated with fronto-parietal cross-frequency dynamics emerging as theta phase-locked beta power bursts. These effects were present regardless of the strength of conflict. Thus, these results provide empirical evidence that midfrontal theta oscillations are involved in cyclically orchestrating brain computations likely related to response execution during the tasks rather than purely related to conflict processing. More generally, this study supports the hypothesis that phase-based computation is an important mechanism giving rise to cognitive processing.",

    "abstract": "Plants produce myriad taxonomically restricted specialized metabolites. This diversity - and our ability to correlate genotype with phenotype - makes the evolution of these ecologically and medicinally important compounds interesting and experimentally tractable. Trichomes of tomato and other nightshade family plants produce structurally diverse protective compounds termed acylsugars. While cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) accumulates strictly acylsucroses, the South American wild relative Solanum pennellii produces copious amounts of acylglucoses. Genetic, transgenic and biochemical dissection of the S. pennellii acylglucose biosynthetic pathway identified a trichome gland cell expressed invertase-like enzyme that hydrolyzes acylsucroses (Sopen03g040490). This enzyme acts on the pyranose ring-acylated acylsucroses found in the wild tomato but not the furanose ring-decorated acylsucroses of cultivated tomato. These results show that modification of the core acylsucrose biosynthetic pathway leading to loss of furanose ring acylation set the stage for co-option of a general metabolic enzyme to produce a new class of protective compounds.",

    "abstract": "In this work we present a framework for blood cholesterol levels prediction from genotype data. The predictor is based on an algorithm for cholesterol metabolism simulation available in literature, implemented and optimized by our group in R language. Main weakness of the former simulation algorithm was the need of experimental data to simulate mutations in genes altering the cholesterol metabolism. This caveat strongly limited the application of the model in the clinical practice. In this work we present how this limitation could be bypassed thanks to an optimization of model parameters based on patients cholesterol levels retrieved from literature. Prediction performance has been assessed taking in consideration several scoring indices currently used for performance evaluation of machine learning methods. Our assessment shows how the optimization phase improved model performance, compared to the original version available in literature.",

    "abstract": "Histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methylation is enriched on actively transcribed genes, and its misregulation is a hallmark of leukemia. Methylation of H3K79, which resides on the structured disk face of the nucleosome, is mediated by the Dot1L methyltransferase. Dot1L activity is part of a trans-histone crosstalk pathway, requiring prior histone H2B ubiquitylation of lysine 120 (H2BK120ub) for optimal activity. However, the molecular details describing both how Dot1L binds to the nucleosome and why Dot1L is activated by H2BK120 ubiquitylation are unknown. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of Dot1L bound to a nucleosome reconstituted with a site-specifically ubiquitylated H2BK120. The structure reveals that Dot1L engages the nucleosome acidic patch using an arginine anchor and occupies a conformation poised for methylation. Ubiquitin directly interacts with Dot1L and is positioned as a clamp on the nucleosome interacting region of Dot1L. Using our structure, we identify point mutations that disrupt the nucleosome-specific and ubiquitin-dependent activities of Dot1L. This study establishes a path to better understand Dot1L function in normal and leukemia cells.",

    "abstract": "Hair cells, the sensory receptors of the inner ear, respond to mechanical forces originating from sounds and accelerations1,2. An essential feature of each hair cell is an array of filamentous tip links, consisting of the proteins protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and cadherin 23 (CDH23)3, whose tension is thought to directly gate the cells transduction channels4,5,6. These links are considered far too stiff to represent the gating springs that convert hair-bundle displacement into forces capable of opening the channels7,8, and no mechanism has been suggested through which tip-link stiffness could be varied to accommodate hair cells of distinct frequency sensitivity in different receptor organs and animals. As a consequence, the gating springs identity and mechanism of operation remain central questions in sensory neuroscience. Using a high-precision optical trap, we show that an individual monomer of PCDH15 acts as an entropic spring that is much softer than its enthalpic stiffness alone would suggest7,8. This low stiffness implies that the protein is a significant part of the gating spring that controls a hair cells transduction channels. The tip links entropic nature then allows for stiffness control through modulation of its tension. We find that a PCDH15 molecule is unstable under tension and exhibits a rich variety of reversible unfolding events that are augmented when the Ca2+ concentration is reduced to physiological levels. Tip-link tension and Ca2+ concentration are therefore likely parameters through which nature tunes a gating springs mechanical properties.",

    "abstract": "A computer joystick is an efficient and cost-effective response device for recording continuous movements in psychological experiments. Movement trajectories and other measures from continuous responses have expanded the insights gained from discrete responses (e.g. button presses) by providing unique information on how cognitive processes unfold over time. However, few studies have evaluated the validity of joystick responses with reference to conventional key presses, and response modality can affect cognitive processes. Here, we systematically compared human participants behavioural performance of perceptual decision-making when they responded with either joystick movements or key presses in a four-alternative motion discrimination task. We found evidence that the response modality did not affect raw behavioural measures including decision accuracy and mean reaction time (RT) at the group level. Furthermore, to compare the underlying decision processes between the two response modalities, we fitted a drift-diffusion model of decision-making to individual participants behavioural data. Bayesian analyses of the model parameters showed no evidence that switching from key presses to continuous joystick movements modulated the decision-making process. These results supported continuous joystick actions as a valid apparatus for continuous movements, although we highlighted the need for caution when conducting experiments with continuous movement responses.",

To investigate the dynamics of activity across these networks on a finer timescale, we used human intracranial electroencephalography with simultaneous recordings within core nodes of the three networks. During attentional task performance, the three sites showed dissociable profiles of high-frequency broadband activity. Anticorrelated infraslow fluctuations of this activity were found across networks during task performance but also intermittently emerged during rest and sleep in concert with the expression of task-like network-level topographic patterns. Critically, on a finer timescale, DAN and SN activations preceded DMN deactivations by hundreds of milliseconds. Moreover, greater lagged, but not zero-lag, anticorrelation between DAN and DMN activity was associated with better attentional performance. These findings have implications for interpreting antagonistic network relationships and confirm the behavioral importance of time-lagged inter-network interactions.",

We conducted a systematic review to examine the relationship between professional medical writing support (PMWS) and the quality, ethics and timeliness of publications reporting clinical trials.\\n\\nMethodsUsing terms related to  medical writer and  observational study, we searched MEDLINE and Embase (no date limits), as well as abstracts and posters from meetings of the International Society for Medical Publication Professionals (ISMPP; 2014-2017). We also hand-searched the journals Medical Writing and The Write Stuff (2014-2017), and the bibliographies of studies identified in the electronic searches. We screened the results to identify studies that compared the quality, ethics and timeliness of clinical trial publications written with and without declared PMWS.\\n\\nResultsOur searches identified 97 potentially relevant studies, of which 89 were excluded during screening and full paper review. The remaining eight studies compared 849 publications with PMWS with 2073 articles developed without such support. In these eight studies, PMWS was shown to be associated with: increased adherence to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines (in 3/3 studies in which this was assessed); publication in journals with an impact factor (one study); a higher quality of written English (one study); and a lower likelihood of reporting non-pre-specified outcomes (one study). PMWS was not associated with increased adherence to CONSORT for Abstracts guidelines (one study) or with the impact of published articles (mean number of citations per year, mean number of article views per year and Altmetric score; one study). In studies that assessed timeliness of publication, PMWS was associated with a reduced time from last patient visit in clinical trials to primary publication (one study), whereas time from submission to acceptance showed inconsistent results (two studies).\\n\\nConclusionsThis systematic review of eight observational studies suggests that PMWS increases the overall quality of reporting of clinical trials and may improve the timeliness of publication.",

However, it is challenging to analyze whole slide image (WSI) at cellular level due to its huge size and nuclear variations. For efficient WSI analysis, this paper presents a general texture descriptor, statistical local binary patterns (SLBP), which is applied to prostate cancer Gleason score prediction from WSI. Unlike traditional local binary patterns (LBP) and many its variants, the presented SLBP encodes local texture patterns via analyzing both median and standard deviation over a regional sampling scheme, so that it can capture more micro- and macro-structure information in the image. Experiments on Gleason score prediction have been performed on 317 different patient cases selected from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) dataset. The presented SLBP descriptor provides over 80% accuracy on two-class (grade [&le;]7 vs grade [&ge;]8) distinction, which is superior to traditional texture descriptors such as histogram, Haralick and other state-of-art LBP variants.",

These ASD DMRs were significantly enriched at promoters, mapped to 596 genes functionally enriched in neuronal development, and overlapped genetic ASD risk. ASD DMRs at CYP2E1 and IRS2 reached genome-wide significance, replicated by pyrosequencing, and correlated with expression. Methylation at CYP2E1 associated with both ASD diagnosis and cis genotype, while methylation at IRS2 was unaffected by cis genotype but modified by preconceptional maternal prenatal vitamin use.

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed hundreds of genetic loci associated with the vulnerability to major psychiatric disorders, and post-GWAS analyses have shown substantial genetic correlations among these disorders. This evidence supports the existence of a higher-order structure of psychopathology at both the genetic and phenotypic levels. Despite recent efforts by collaborative consortia such as the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP), this structure remains unclear. In this study, we tested multiple alternative structural models of psychopathology at the genomic level, using the genetic correlations among fourteen psychiatric disorders and related psychological traits estimated from GWAS summary statistics. The best-fitting model included four correlated higher-order factors - externalizing, internalizing, thought problems, and neurodevelopmental disorders - which showed distinct patterns of genetic correlations with external validity variables and accounted for substantial genetic variance in their constituent disorders. A bifactor model including a general factor of psychopathology as well as the four specific factors fit worse than the above model. Several model modifications were tested to explore the placement of some disorders - such as bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and eating disorders - within the broader psychopathology structure. The best-fitting model indicated that eating disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder, on the one hand, and bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, on the other, load together on the same thought problems factor. These findings provide support for several of the HiTOP higher-order dimensions and suggest a similar structure of psychopathology at the genomic and phenotypic levels.",

We analysed >1,300 genomes of 70 different Streptococcus species for evidence of prophages and identified nearly 800 prophages and satellite prophages, the majority of which are reported here for the first time. We show that prophages and satellite prophages were widely distributed among streptococci, were two clearly different entities and each possessed a structured population. There was convincing evidence that cross-species transmission of prophages is not uncommon. Furthermore, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a leading human pathogen worldwide, but the genetic basis for its pathogenicity and virulence is not yet fully understood. Here we report that over one-third of pneumococcal genomes possessed satellite prophages and demonstrate for the first time that a satellite prophage was associated with virulence in a murine model of infection. Overall, our findings demonstrate that prophages are widespread components of Streptococcus species and suggest that they play a role in pneumococcal pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Cue combination occurs when two independent noisy perceptual estimates are merged together as a weighted average, creating a unified estimate that is more precise than either single estimate alone. Surprisingly, this effect has not been demonstrated compellingly in children under the age of 10 years, in contrast with the array of other multisensory skills that children show even in infancy. Instead, across a wide variety of studies, precision with both cues is no better than the best single cue - and sometimes worse. Here we provide the first consistent evidence of cue combination in children from 7-10 years old. Across three experiments, participants showed evidence of a bimodal precision advantage (Experiments 1a and 1b) and the majority were best-fit by a combining model (Experiment 2). The task was to localize a target horizontally with a binaural audio cue and a noisy visual cue in immersive virtual reality. Feedback was given as well, which could both (a) help participants judge how reliable each cue is and (b) help correct between-cue biases that might prevent cue combination. A feedback effect was found in Experiment 2, with children who were given single-cue feedback showing the highest rate of cue combination. Given this, we suggest that children at 7-10 years old are capable of cue combination in principle, but must have sufficient representations of reliabilities and biases in their own perceptual estimates as relevant to the task, which can be facilitated through task-specific feedback.",

This can be achieved using several cues, including binocular stereoscopic cues such as changing disparity and interocular velocity differences and monocular cues such as looming. While these have been studied in detail in humans, only looming responses have been well characterized in insects and we know nothing about the role that stereo cues play and how they might interact with looming cues. We used our 3D insect cinema in a series of experiments to investigate the role of the stereo cues mentioned above, as well as looming, in the perception of motion-in-depth during predatory strikes by the praying mantis. Our results show that motion-in-depth does increase the probability of mantis strikes but only for the classic looming stimulus, an expanding luminance edge. Approach indicated by radial motion of a texture or expansion of a motion-defined edge, or by stereoscopic cues, all failed to elicit increased striking. We conclude that mantises use stereopsis to detect depth but not motion-in-depth, which is detected via looming.\\n\\nSummary StatementBoth stereoscopic visual cues and changing luminance cues can enable detection of approaching objects. We show that mantises use looming rather than stereo cues to detect motion-in-depth.",

    "abstract": "We report on the variable venom composition of a population of the Caucasus viper (Vipera kaznakovi) in Northeastern Turkey. We applied a combination of venom gland transcriptomics, as well as de-complexing bottom-up and top-down venomics, enabling the comparison of the venom proteomes from multiple individuals. In total, we identified peptides and proteins from 15 toxin families, including snake venom metalloproteinases (svMP; 37.8%), phospholipases A2 (PLA2; 19.0%), snake venom serine proteinases (svSP; 11.5%), C-type lectins (CTL; 6.9%) and cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP; 5.0%), in addition to several low abundant toxin families. Furthermore, we identified intra-species variations of the V. kaznakovi venom composition, and find these were mainly driven by the age of the animals, with lower svSP abundance in juveniles. On a proteoform level, several small molecular weight toxins between 5 and 8 kDa in size, as well as PLA2s, drove the difference between juvenile and adult individuals. This study provides first insights into venom variability of V. kaznakovi and highlights the utility of intact mass profiling for a fast and detailed comparison of snake venoms of individuals from a community.\\n\\nBiological SignificancePopulation level and ontogenetic venom variation (e.g. diet, habitat, sex or age) can cause a loss of antivenom efficacy against snake bites from wide ranging snake populations. The state of the art for the analysis of snake venoms are de-complexing bottom-up proteomics approaches. While useful, these have the significant drawback of being time-consuming and following costly protocols, and consequently are often applied to pooled venom samples. To overcome these shortcomings and to enable rapid and detailed profiling of large numbers of individual venom samples, we integrated an intact protein analysis workflow into a transcriptomics-guided bottom-up approach. The application of this workflow to snake individuals of a local population of V. kaznakovi revealed intra-species variations in venom composition, which are primarily explained by the age of the animals, and highlighted svSP abundance to be one of the molecular drivers for the compositional differences.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIFirst community venomic analysis of a local population of the Caucasian viper (Vipera kaznakovi).\\nC_LIO_LIThe venom gland transcriptome of V. kaznakovi identified 46 toxin genes relating to 15 venom toxin families.\\nC_LIO_LIBottom-up venomics revealed the identification of 25 proteins covering 7 toxin families mainly dominated by snake venom metalloproteinases (svMP).\\nC_LIO_LICommunity venomics by top-down mass profiling revealed ontogenetic shifts between juvenile and adult snakes.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Polarity decisions are central to many processes, including mitosis and chemotropism. In S. cerevisiae, budding and mating projection (MP) formation use an overlapping system of cortical landmarks that converge on the small G-protein Cdc42. However, pheromone gradient sensing must override the Rsr1-dependent internal polarity cues used for budding. Using this model system, we asked what happens when intrinsic and extrinsic spatial cues are misaligned. Is there competition, or collaboration? By live cell microscopy and microfluidics technics we uncovered three previously overlooked features of this signaling system. First, the cytokinesis-associated polarization patch serves as a polarity landmark independently of all known cues. Second, the Rax1-Rax2 complex functions as novel pheromone promoted polarity cue in the distal pole of the cells. Finally, we showed that internal cues remain active during pheromone gradient tracking and that they interfere with this process biasing the location of MPs, since yeast defective in internal cue utilization align significantly better than wild-type with artificially generated pheromone gradients.",

    "abstract": "Insecticide resistance is a paradigm of microevolution and insecticides are responsible for the strongest cases of recent selection in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Here we use a naive population and a novel insecticide class to examine the ab initio genetic architecture of a potential selective response. Genome wide association studies of chlorantraniliprole susceptibility reveal variation in a gene of major effect, Stretchin Myosin light chain kinase (Strn-Mlck), which we validate with linkage mapping and transgenic manipulation of gene expression. We propose that allelic variation in Strn-Mlck alters sensitivity to the calcium depletion attributable to chlorantraniliproles mode of action. Genome-wide association studies also reveal a network of genes involved in neuromuscular biology. In contrast, phenotype to transcriptome associations identify differences in constitutive levels of multiple transcripts regulated by cnc, the homologue of mammalian Nrf2. This suggests that genetic variation acts in trans to regulate multiple metabolic enzymes in this pathway. The most outstanding association is with the transcription level of Cyp12d1 which is also affected in cis by copy number variation. Transgenic overexpression of Cyp12d1 reduces susceptibility to both chlorantraniliprole and the closely related insecticide cyantraniliprole. This systems genetics study reveals multiple allelic variants segregating at intermediate frequency in a population that is completely naive to this new insecticide chemistry and it adumbrates a selective response among natural populations to these chemicals.\\n\\nSignificanceAround the world insecticides are being deregistered and banned, as their environmental costs are deemed too great or their efficacy against pest insects is reduced through the evolution of insecticide resistance. With the introduction of replacement insecticides comes the responsibility to assess the way new insecticides perturb various levels of biological systems; from insect physiology to ecosystems. We used a systems genetics approach to identify genetic variants affecting survivorship of Drosophila melanogaster exposed to chlorantraniliprole. The study population was completely naive to this insecticide chemistry and yet we find associations with variants in neuromuscular genes and co-regulated detoxification genes. We predict that these variants will increase in populations of this  sentinel species as these insecticides are applied in the environment.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we evaluate the performance of using a family-specific low-density genotype arrays to increase the accuracy of pedigree based imputation. Genotype imputation is a widely used tool that decreases the costs of genotyping a population by genotyping the majority of individuals using a low-density array and using statistical regularities between the low-density and high-density individuals to fill in the missing genotypes. Previous work on population based imputation has found that it is possible to increase the accuracy of imputation by maximizing the number of informative markers on an array. In the context of pedigree based imputation, where the informativeness of a marker depends only on the genotypes of an individuals parents, it may be beneficial to select the markers on each low-density array on a family-by-family basis. In this paper we examined four family-specific low-density marker selection strategies, and evaluated their performance in the context of a real pig breeding dataset. We found that family-specific or sire-specific arrays could increase imputation accuracy by 0.11 at 1 marker per chromosome, by 0.027 at 25 markers per chromosome and by 0.007 at 100 markers per chromosome. These results suggest that there may be a room to use family-specific genotyping for very-low-density arrays particularly if a given sire or sire-dam pairing have a large number of offspring.",

Identifying PND-associated autoantibodies and their cognate antigens can assist with proper diagnosis and treatment while also enhancing our understanding of tumor-associated immune processes, triggers for autoimmune disease, and the functional significance of onconeuronal proteins. Here, we employed an enhanced version of phage display immunoprecipitation and sequencing (PhIP-Seq) leveraging a library of over 731,000 unique phage clones tiling across the entire human proteome to detect autoantibodies and create high-resolution epitope profiles in serum and CSF samples from patients suffering from two common PNDs, the anti-Yo (n = 36 patients) and anti-Hu syndromes (n = 44 patients). All patient samples positive for anti-Yo antibody by a validated clinical assay yielded polyspecific enrichment of phage presenting peptides from the canonical anti-Yo (CDR2 and CDR2L) antigens, while 38% of anti-Hu patients (17/44) had a serum and/or CSF sample that significantly enriched peptides deriving from the ELAVL family of proteins, the anti-Hu autoantigenic target. The anti-Hu antibodies showed a remarkably convergent antigenic signature across 15/17 patients corresponding to residues surrounding and including the degenerate motif, RLDxLL, shared by ELAVL2, 3 and 4. Lastly, PhIP-Seq identified several known and novel autoantigens in these same patient samples, representing potential biomarkers that could aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of PND and cancer.",

Here we present ASCOT, a resource that allows researchers to summarize, visualize, and query alternative splicing patterns in public RNA-Seq data. ASCOT enables rapid identification of splice-variants across tens of thousands of bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq datasets in human and mouse. To demonstrate the utility of ASCOT, we first focused on the nervous system and identified many alternative exons used only by a single neuronal subtype. We then leveraged datasets from the ENCODE and GTEx consortiums to study the unique splicing patterns of rod photoreceptors and found that PTBP1 knockdown combined with overexpression of MSI1 and PCBP2 activates rod-specific exons in HepG2 liver cancer cells. Furthermore, we observed that MSI1 targets intronic UAG motifs proximal to the 5 splice site and interacts synergistically with PTBP1 downregulation. Finally, we show that knockdown of MSI1 in the retina abolishes rod-specific splicing. This work demonstrates how large-scale analysis of public RNA-Seq datasets can yield key insights into cell type-specific control of RNA splicing and underscores the importance of considering both annotated and unannotated splicing events.

They were assessed with the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised (ADI-R). We found no significant differences in BRIEF or ADI-R scores between girls and boys after correcting for multiple testing. Nested linear regression models revealed significant sex differences in the relationship between executive function and both reciprocal social interaction (p<0.001) and communication (p=0.001) over and above the main effects of age, sex, IQ and comorbid attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnosis. We did not find sex differences in the relationship between executive dysfunction and restricted and repetitive behaviors. Altogether, our results provide a greater understanding of the sex-specific characteristics of ASD and may suggest that boys and girls can benefit from different intervention strategies.",

We developed a simple and inexpensive method of marking eggs inside of the ovary of a nesting fish, the bluebanded goby (Lythrypnus dalli), in order to quantify female reproductive success. Multiple females in a harem of L. dalli can lay eggs inside of the males nest within a short period of time, making the timing of egg laying or developmental stage of the eggs insufficient to identify which female laid which clutch of eggs. After injecting small volumes of food coloring into the ovaries, each females eggs can be identified throughout development by the color of the yolk. We make preliminary observations about the efficacy of different colors (red, yellow, green, blue) for use in L. dalli, including effects on female survival, social behavior, and the enzyme immunoassays used to quantify hormones. While rigorous validations should be conducted for each species and experimental context, this method of marking eggs has the potential to be broadly useful for directly estimating fitness in species with external fertilization, as well as research in reproductive biology, development, behavioral ecology, and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication, and in mammals are generally classified as ~50-150nm exosomes, ~100-1000nm microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, each arising as a result of different biological processes. EVs carry protein, lipids, and nucleic acids within the circulation, to target cells whereupon they mediate physiological changes. Due to their small size, quantification and characterization by conventional microscopy is not possible. However, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) has provided a method to determine the fluid concentration and size of extracellular vesicles and other nanoparticles. While NTA provides statistical summaries of samples in an experiment, a recurring difficulty is the organization, manipulation, and management of raw particle count data because of the large size of datasets, and resultant vulnerability to user error. To address these limitations, we developed tidyNano, an R package that provides functions to import, clean, and quickly summarize raw NanoSight (Malvern Panalytical) data for efficient calculation of statistics and visualization. Here, we provide a framework for importing raw nanoparticle data and provide functions to facilitate rapid and efficient analysis, visualization and calculation of summary statistics. tidyNano was used to analyze murine plasma extracellular vesicles across gestation by aggregating and summarizing samples based on technical, biological and gestational parameters. In addition, we developed shinySIGHT, a Shiny web application that allows for interactive exploration and visualization of EV data. Using this package, we analyzed data generated from 36 samples of EV derived from the plasma of mice across gestation.\\n\\nPeripheral EV concentration increased linearly across pregnancy, with trending increases as early as gestation day (GD) 5.5 and significant rises at GD14.5, and 17.5 relative to EV concentrations in nonpregnant females. Thus, the data highlight the utility of the mouse as a model of EV biology in pregnancy. Further, the package provides a mechanism for seamless analysis of EV data generated by NanoSight. Importantly, this package provides a straightforward framework by which diverse types of large datasets can be simply and efficiently analyzed. tidyNano and shinySIGHT are freely available under the MIT license and is hosted on GitHub (https://nguyens7.github.io/tidyNano/).",

    "abstract": "The episodic production of large seed crops by some perennial plants, is referred to as masting and is known to increase seed escape by alternately starving and swamping seed predators. These pulses of resources, however, might also act as an agent of selection on the life histories of seed predators, which could indirectly enhance seed escape by inducing an evolutionary load on seed predator populations. Lag loads in seed predators could result from mast-induced shifts in optimum phenotypes that exceed the capacity of seed predators to adaptively track optimum phenotypes through phenotypic plasticity. Alternatively, masting could generate mismatches in selection across generations, where adaptation to the parental environment leads to maladaptation in the offspring environment. Here we measured natural selection on female North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) across 28 years and five white spruce (Picea glauca) masting events. Red squirrel litter sizes were similar to optimum litter sizes during non-mast years, but were well below optimum litter sizes during resource-rich mast years. Mast events, therefore caused selection for larger litters ({beta} = 0.25) and a lag load (L = 0.25) on red squirrels during mast years. Furthermore, we found that the annual fitness of spruce trees was negatively related to the local density of squirrels during mast years, indicating that the observed lag load on squirrels enhanced the number of spruce cones escaping squirrel predation. Although, the frequency of mast events and the demography of red squirrels were such that offspring and parents often experienced opposite environments with respect to the mast, we found no effect of environmental mismatches across generations on either offspring survival or population growth. Instead, squirrels plastically increased litter sizes in anticipation of mast events, which partially, although not completely, reduced the lag load resulting from this change in food availability. Variable selection on litter size caused by white spruce mast events, therefore, induced a lag load on the population of red squirrels that was not affected by whether individual squirrels were born during mast (matching) or non-mast (mismatching) conditions.",

    "abstract": "The earliest event recorded in the molecular evolution of photosynthesis is the structural and functional specialisation of Type I (ferredoxin-reducing) and Type II (quinone-reducing) reaction centres. Here we point out that the homodimeric Type I reaction centre of Heliobacteria has a Ca2+-binding site with a number of striking parallels to the Mn4CaO5 cluster of cyanobacterial Photosystem II. This structural parallels indicate that water oxidation chemistry originated at the divergence of Type I and Type II reaction centres. We suggests that this divergence was triggered by a structural rearrangement of a core transmembrane helix resulting in a shift of the redox potential of the electron donor side and electron acceptor side at the same time and in the same redox direction.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is highly prevalent worldwide, contributing a significant socioeconomic and public health burden. Several aspects of chronic pain, for example back pain and a severity-related phenotype, chronic pain grade, have been shown to be complex, heritable traits with a polygenic component. Additional pain-related phenotypes capturing aspects of an individuals overall sensitivity to experiencing and reporting chronic pain have also been suggested. We have here made use of a measure of the number of sites of chronic pain in individuals within the general UK population. This measure, termed Multisite Chronic Pain (MCP), is also a complex trait, but its genetic architecture has not previously been investigated. To address this, a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MCP was carried out in ~380,000 UK Biobank participants to identify associated genetic variants. Findings were consistent with MCP having a significant polygenic component with a SNP heritability of 10.2%, and 76 independent lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 39 risk loci were identified. Additional gene-level association analyses identified neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, nervous system development, cell-cycle progression and apoptosis genes as being enriched for genetic association with MCP. Genetic correlations were observed between MCP and a range of psychiatric, autoimmune and anthropometric traits including major depressive disorder (MDD), asthma and BMI. Furthermore, in Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses a bi-directional causal relationship was observed between MCP and MDD. A polygenic risk score (PRS) for MCP was found to significantly predict chronic widespread pain (pain all over the body), indicating the existence of genetic variants contributing to both of these pain phenotypes. These findings support the proposition that chronic pain involves a strong nervous system component and have implications for our understanding of the physiology of chronic pain and for the development of novel treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Automated machine learning (AutoML) systems are helpful data science assistants designed to scan data for novel features, select appropriate supervised learning models and optimize their parameters. For this purpose, Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) was developed using strongly typed genetic programming to recommend an optimized analysis pipeline for the data scientists prediction problem. However, TPOT may reach computational resource limits when working on big data such as whole-genome expression data. We introduce two new features implemented in TPOT that helps increase the systems scalability: Dataset selector and Template. Dataset selector (DS) provides the option to specify subsets of the features as separate datasets, assuming the signals come from one or more of these specific data subsets. Built in at the beginning of each pipeline structure, DS reduces the computational expense of TPOT to only evaluate on a smaller subset of data rather than the entire dataset. Consequently, DS increases TPOTs efficiency in application on big data by slicing the dataset into smaller sets of features and allowing genetic programming to select the best subset in the final pipeline. Template enforces type constraints with strongly typed genetic programming and enables the incorporation of DS at the beginning of each pipeline. We show that DS and Template help reduce TPOT computation time and may provide more interpretable results. Our simulations show TPOT-DS significantly outperforms a tuned XGBoost model and standard TPOT implementation. We apply TPOT-DS to real RNA-Seq data from a study of major depressive disorder. Independent of the previous study that identified significant association with depression severity of the enrichment scores of two modules, in an automated fashion, TPOT-DS corroborates that one of the modules is largely predictive of the clinical diagnosis of each individual.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBig data have recently become prevalent in many fields including meteorology, complex physics simulations, large scale imaging, genomics, biomedical research, environmental research and more. TPOT is a Python Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) tool that uses genetic programming to optimize machine learning pipelines for analyzing biomedical data. However, like other AutoML tools, when analyzing big data, the early implementations of TPOT face the challenges of long runtime, high computational expense as well complex pipeline with low interpretability. Here, we develop two novel features for TPOT, Dataset Selector and Template, that leverage domain knowledge, greatly reduce the computational expense and flexibly extend TPOTs application to biomedical big data analysis.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune connective tissue diseases arise in a stepwise fashion from asymptomatic preclinical autoimmunity. Type I interferons (IFNs) have a crucial role in the progression to established autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, their cellular source and regulation in disease initiation are unclear. The current paradigm suggests that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are activated in SLE contributing to excessive IFN production. Here, we show that in preclinical autoimmunity, established SLE, and primary Sjogrens Syndrome, pDCs are not effector cells, but rather have lost their capacity for TLR-mediated IFN- and TNF production and fail to induce T cell activation, independently of disease activity and blood IFN signature. In addition, pDCs present a transcriptional signature of cellular stress and senescence accompanied by increased telomere erosion. Instead, we demonstrate a marked enrichment of IFN signature in non-lesional skin in preclinical autoimmunity. In these individuals and SLE patients, type I IFNs were abundantly produced by keratinocytes in the absence of infiltrating leucocytes. These findings revise our understanding of the role of IFN in the initiation of human autoimmunity, with non-haematopoietic tissues perpetuating IFN responses, which in turn predict clinical disease. These data indicate potential therapeutic targets outside the conventional immune system for treatment and prevention.",

    "abstract": "Local translation can support memory consolidation by supplying new proteins to synapses undergoing plasticity. Translation in adult forebrain dendrites is an established mechanism of synaptic plasticity and is regulated by learning, yet there is no evidence for learning-regulated protein synthesis in adult forebrain axons, which have traditionally been believed to be incapable of translation. Here we show that axons in the adult rat amygdala contain translation machinery, and use translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) with RNASeq to identify mRNAs in cortical axons projecting to the amygdala, over 1200 of which were regulated during consolidation of associative memory. Mitochondrial and translation-related genes were upregulated, whereas synaptic, cytoskeletal, and myelin-related genes were downregulated; the opposite effects were observed in the cortex. Our results demonstrate that learning-regulated axonal translation occurs in the adult forebrain, and support the likelihood that local translation is more a rule than an exception in neuronal processes.",

    "abstract": "The brain adapts to the sensory environment. For example, simple sensory exposure can modify the response properties of early sensory neurons. How these changes affect the overall encoding and maintenance of stimulus information across neuronal populations remains unclear. We perform parallel recordings in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized cats and find that brief, repetitive exposure to structured visual stimuli enhances stimulus encoding by decreasing the selectivity and increasing the range of the neuronal responses that persist after stimulus presentation. Low-dimensional projection methods and simple classifiers demonstrate that visual exposure increases the segregation of persistent neuronal population responses into stimulus-specific clusters. These observed refinements preserve the representational details required for stimulus reconstruction and are detectable in post-exposure spontaneous activity. Assuming response facilitation and recurrent network interactions as the core mechanisms underlying stimulus persistence, we show that the exposure-driven segregation of stimulus responses can arise through strictly local plasticity mechanisms, also in the absence of firing rate changes. Our findings provide evidence for the existence of an automatic, unguided optimization process that enhances the encoding power of neuronal populations in early visual cortex, thus potentially benefiting simple readouts at higher stages of visual processing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSystemic inflammation, such as occurs during sepsis, bone fracture, infections or post-operative trauma, has been linked to synapse loss and cognitive decline in human patients and animal models. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) represent an underused tool in neuroinflammation; retaining much of the neuronal architecture, synaptic connections and diversity of cell types present in the hippocampus in vivo whilst providing convenient access to manipulate and sample the culture medium and observe cellular reactions as in other in vitro methods. Here we report the development of an OHSC model of synaptic disruption after aseptic inflammation and investigate the underlying mechanism.\\n\\nMethodsOHSCs were generated from P6-P9 C57BL/6, the APP transgenic TgCRND8 model, or wild-type littermate mice according to the interface method. Aseptic inflammation was induced via addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cultures were analysed for changes in synaptic proteins via western blot. qPCR and ELISA analysis of the slice tissue and culture medium respectively determined changes in gene expression and protein secretion. Microglia were selectively depleted using the toxin clodronate and the effect of IL1{beta} was assessed using a specific neutralising monoclonal antibody.\\n\\nResultsAddition of LPS caused a loss of the presynaptic protein synaptophysin via a mechanism dependent on microglia and involving IL1{beta}. Washout of LPS via medium exchange allows for partial recovery of synaptic protein levels after 2 weeks. TgCRND8 OHSCs do not show alterations in IL1{beta} expression at a timepoint where they exhibit spontaneous synaptophysin loss, and LPS does not alter levels of APP or A{beta} in wild-type OHSCs. This indicates that although synaptophysin loss is seen in both systems, there is likely to be distinct underlying pathogenic mechanisms between the neuroinflammatory and amyloid models.\\n\\nConclusionsWe report the development of an OHSC model of LPS-induced synaptophysin loss and demonstrate a key role for microglia and involvement of IL1{beta}. We propose that distinct molecular mechanisms lead to synaptophysin protein loss in LPS-exposed versus TgCRND8 OHSCs and provide a new experimental paradigm for assessing chronic changes in synaptic proteins, and synaptic plasticity, following acute inflammatory insults.",

Mice perform warm discrimination tasks without dedicated thermoreceptors, but use information carried by unmyelinated polymodal C-fibers. Deletion of the heat-sensitive transduction channels TRPM2 and TRPV1 did not impact warming perception or afferent coding of warm. However, without the cold sensitive TRPM8 channel, afferent coding of cooling was impaired and these mice cannot perceive warming or cooling. Our data is incompatible with the existence of thermospecific labelled lines, but can be reconciled by the existence of central circuits that compare and integrate the input from at least two types of polymodal afferents, hitherto thought to exclusively signal pain.",

Since March 2016, CHIKV is the arbovirus infection most frequently diagnosed in Rio de Janeiro. In the analysis of 1835 syndromic patients, screened by real time RT-PCR, 56.4% of the cases were attributed to CHIKV, 29.6% to ZIKV, and 14.1% to DENV-4. Sequence analyses of CHIKV from sixteen samples revealed that the East-Central-South-African (ECSA) genotype of CHIKV has been circulating in Brazil since 2013 [95% bayesian credible interval (BCI): 03/2012-10/2013], almost a year before it was detected by arbovirus surveillance program. Brazilian cases are related to Central African Republic sequences from 1980s. To the best of our knowledge, given the available sequence published here and elsewhere, the ECSA genotype was likely introduced to Rio de Janeiro early on 2014 (02/2014; BCI: 07/2013-08/2014) through a single event, after primary circulation in the Bahia state at the Northestern Brazil in the previous year. The observation that the ECSA genotype of CHIKV was circulating undetected underscores the need for improvements in molecular methods for viral surveillance.",

However, no study has yet evaluated the impact of dual language experience on variability in fMRI responses during a higher-level spoken and written language processing task. In the current study, we calculated trial-by-trial variability in neural activation during an fMRI task that involved deciding whether spoken or printed English words matched pictures of items. We compared trial-by-trial neural activation variability between two groups of 8-15 year-old children: a group of dual language learners (N = 24; 11 female) who were Spanish-dominant and acquiring English, and a group of monolingual learners who were English-dominant (N = 17; 9 female). We found that when controlling for a variety of language, general cognitive, and demographic measures, neural activation variability for printed words was greater in the dual language learners compared to the monolingual learners in the right middle frontal gyrus, a brain region previously associated with attentional control. This finding highlights how neural variability offers a window of opportunity to examine experience-dependent mechanisms during human development, and motivates future research on bilingual language processing.",

The mechanism of increased local and systemic acquired resistance mediated by Trichoderma involved increased N uptake and enhanced protein levels via modulation of nitrate transporter genes. The nrt2.1 mutant is compromised in local and systemic acquired resistance responses suggesting a link between enhanced N transport and defense. Enhanced N uptake was mediated by Trichoderma elicited nitric oxide (NO). Low NO producing nia1,2 mutant and nsHb+ over expressing lines were unable to induce nitrate transporters and thereby compromised defense in the presence of Trichoderma under low N suggesting a signaling role of Trichoderma elicited NO. Trichoderma also induced SA and defense gene expression under low N. The SA deficient NahG transgenic line and the npr1 mutant were also compromised in Trichoderma-mediated local and systemic acquired resistance responses. Collectively our results indicated that the mechanism of enhanced plant defense under low N mediated by Trichoderma involves NO, ROS, SA production as well as the induction of NRT and marker genes for systemic acquired resistance.\n\nOne-sentence summaryTrichoderma enhances local and systemic acquired resistance under low nitrate nutrition",
