    "abstract": "We propose a computational model of vision that describes the integration of cross-modal sensory information between the olfactory and visual systems in zebrafish based on the principles of the statistical extreme value theory. The integration of olfacto-retinal information is mediated by the centrifugal pathway that originates from the olfactory bulb and terminates in the neural retina. Motivation for using extreme value theory stems from physiological evidence suggesting that extremes and not the mean of the cell responses direct cellular activity in the vertebrate brain. We argue that the visual system, as measured by retinal ganglion cell responses in spikes/sec, follows an extreme value process for sensory integration and the increase in visual sensitivity from the olfactory input can be better modeled using extreme value distributions. As zebrafish maintains high evolutionary proximity to mammals, our model can be extended to other vertebrates as well.",

    "abstract": "Many models of classical conditioning fail to describe important phenomena, notably the rapid return of fear after extinction. To address this shortfall, evidence converged on the idea that learning agents rely on latent-state inferences, i.e. an ability to index disparate associations from cues to rewards (or penalties) and infer which index (i.e. latent state) is presently active. Our goal was to develop a model of latent-state inferences that uses latent states to predict rewards from cues efficiently and that can describe behavior in a diverse set of experiments. The resulting model combines a Rescorla-Wagner rule, for which updates to associations are proportional to prediction error, with an approximate Bayesian rule, for which beliefs in latent states are proportional to prior beliefs and an approximate likelihood based on current associations. In simulation, we demonstrate the models ability to reproduce learning effects both famously explained and not explained by the Rescorla-Wagner model, including rapid return of fear after extinction, the Hall-Pearce effect, partial reinforcement extinction effect, backwards blocking, and memory modification. Lastly, we derive our model as an online algorithm to maximum likelihood estimation, demonstrating it is an efficient approach to outcome prediction. Establishing such a framework is a key step towards quantifying normative and pathological ranges of latent-state inferences in various contexts.\\n\\nAuthor summaryComputational researchers are increasingly interested in a structured form of learning known as latent-state inferences. Latent-state inferences is a type of learning that involves categorizing, generalizing, and recalling disparate associations between observations in ones environment and is used in situations when the correct association is latent or unknown. This type of learning has been used to explain overgeneralization of a fear memory and the cognitive role of certain brain regions important to cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry. Accordingly, latent-state inferences are an important area of inquiry. Through simulation and theory, we establish a new model of latent-state inferences. Moving forward, we aim to use this framework to measure latent-state inferences in healthy and psychiatric populations.",

    "abstract": "Coral disease research encompasses five decades of undeniable progress. Since the first descriptions of anomalous signs, we have come to understand multiple processes and environmental drivers that interact with coral pathologies. To gain a better insight into the knowledge we already have, we explored how key topics in coral disease research have been related to each other using network analysis. We reviewed 719 papers and conference proceedings published from 1965 to 2017. From each study, four elements determined our network nodes: 1) studied disease(s); 2) host genus; 3) marine ecoregion(s) associated with the study site; and 4) research objectives. Basic properties of this network confirmed that there is a set of specific topics comprising the majority of research. The top five diseases, genera, and ecoregions studied accounted for over 48% of the research effort in all cases. The community structure analysis identified 15 clusters of topics with different degrees of overlap among them. These clusters represent the typical sets of elements that appear together for a given study. Our results show that while some coral diseases have been studied considering multiple aspects, the overall trend is for most diseases to be understood under a limited range of approaches, e.g. bacterial assemblages have been considerably studied in Yellow and Black band diseases while immune response has been better examined for the aspergillosis-Gorgonia system. Thus, our challenge in the near future is to identify and resolve potential gaps in order to achieve a more comprehensive progress on coral disease research.",

    "abstract": "1.What is the role of each node in a system of many interconnected nodes? This can be quantified by comparing the dynamics of the nodes in the intact system, with their modified dynamics in the edited system, where one node is deleted. In detail, the spectra are calculated from a causal multivariate autoregressive model for the intact system. Next, without re-estimation, one node is deleted from the model and the modified spectra at all other nodes are re-calculated. The change in spectra from the edited system to the intact system quantifies the role of the deleted node, giving a measure of its Granger-causal effects (CFX) on the system. A generalization of this novel measure is available for networks (i.e. for groups of nodes), which quantifies the role of each network in a system of many networks.

    "abstract": "In an ever-changing environment, survival depends on learning which stimuli represent threat, and also on updating such associations when circumstances shift. Humans can acquire physiological responses to threat-associated stimuli even when they are unaware of them, but the role of awareness in updating threat contingencies remains unknown. This complex process - generating novel responses while simultaneously suppressing learned ones - relies on distinct neural mechanisms from initial learning, and has only been shown with awareness. Can it occur unconsciously? Here we show that it can. Participants underwent classical threat conditioning to visual stimuli that were suppressed from their awareness. One of two images was paired with an electric shock; halfway through the experiment, contingencies were reversed and the shock was paired with the other image. We found that physiological responses reflected changes in stimulus-threat pairings independently of stimulus awareness, demonstrating the sophistication of unconscious affective flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Sensing and responding to environmental water deficiency and osmotic stresses is essential for the growth, development and survival of plants. Recently, an osmolality-sensing ion channel called OSCA1 was discovered that functions in sensing hyperosmolality in Arabidopsis. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure and function of an ion channel from rice (Oryza sativa; OsOSCA1.2), showing how it mediates hyperosmolality sensing and ion permeability. The structure reveals a dimer; the molecular architecture of each subunit consists of eleven transmembrane helices and a cytosolic soluble domain that has homology to RNA recognition proteins. The transmembrane domain is structurally related to the TMEM16 family of calcium dependent ion channels and scramblases. The cytosolic soluble domain possesses a distinct structural feature in the form of extended intracellular helical arms that is parallel to the plasma membrane. These helical arms are well positioned to sense lateral tension on the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer caused by changes in turgor pressure. Computational dynamic analysis suggests how this domain couples to the transmembrane portion of the molecule to open the channel. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) experimentally confirms the conformational dynamics of these coupled domains. The structure provides a framework to understand the structural basis of hyperosmolality sensing in an important crop plant, extends our knowledge of the anoctamin superfamily important for plants and fungi, and provides a structural mechanism for translating membrane stress to ion transport regulation.",

The GATA1 transcription factor is an established mediator of RBC development. However, the upstream mechanisms that regulate the expression of GATA1 are not completely characterized. Cholesterol is one potential upstream mediator of GATA1 expression because previously published studies suggest that defects in cholesterol synthesis disrupt RBC differentiation. Here we characterize RBC development in a zebrafish harboring a single missense mutation in the hmgcs1 gene (Vu57 allele). hmgcs1 encodes the first enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway and mutation of hmgcs1 inhibits cholesterol synthesis. We analyzed the number of RBCs in hmgcs1 mutants and their wildtype siblings. Mutation of hmgcs1 resulted in a decrease in the number of mature RBCs, which coincides with reduced gata1a expression. We combined these experiments with pharmacological inhibition and confirmed that cholesterol and isoprenoid synthesis are essential for RBC differentiation, but that gata1a expression is isoprenoid dependent. Collectively, our results reveal two novel upstream regulators of RBC development and suggest that appropriate cholesterol homeostasis is critical for primitive erythropoiesis.\\n\\nKey PointsO_LIThe products of the cholesterol synthesis pathway regulate red blood cell development during primitive erythropoiesis.\\nC_LIO_LIIsoprenoids regulate erythropoiesis by modulating the expression of the GATA1 transcription factor.\\nC_LI",

Such multi-factorial systems are difficult to decode in vertebrates owing to their complex gene hierarchies and transient dynamic molecular interactions. Here we present a genome-wide in vivo reconstruction of the GRN underlying development of neural crest (NC), an emblematic embryonic multipotent cell population. By coupling NC-specific epigenomic and single-cell transcriptome profiling with genome/epigenome engineering in vivo, we identify multiple regulatory layers governing NC ontogeny, including NC-specific enhancers and super-enhancers, novel trans-factors and cis-signatures. Assembling the NC regulome has allowed the comprehensive reverse engineering of the NC-GRN at unprecedented resolution. Furthermore, identification and dissection of divergent upstream combinatorial regulatory codes has afforded new insights into opposing gene circuits that define canonical and neural NC fates. Our integrated approach, allowing dissection of cell-type-specific regulatory circuits in vivo, has broad implications for GRN discovery and investigation.",

    "abstract": "Sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) is a transmembrane pump that plays an important role in transporting calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). While calcium (Ca2+) binds SERCA with micro-molar affinity, magnesium (Mg2+) and potassium (K+) also compete with calcium (Ca2+) binding. However, the molecular bases for these competing ions influence on SERCA function and the selectivity of the pump for Ca2+ are not well-established. We therefore used in silico methods to resolve molecular determinants of cation binding in the canonical site I and II Ca2+ binding sites: 1) triplicate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Mg2+, Ca2+and K+-bound SERCA. 2) mean spherical approximation (MSA) theory to determine the affinity and selectivity of cation binding to the MD-resolved structures and 3) state models of SERCA turnover informed from MSA-derived affinity data. Our key findings are that a) coordination at sites I and II are optimized for Ca2+and to a lesser extent for Mg2+ and K+, as determined by MD-derived cation-amino acid oxygen and bound water configurations, b) the impaired coordination and high desolvation cost for Mg2+ precludes favorable Mg2+ binding relative to Ca2+, while K+ has limited capacity to bind site I, c) Mg2+ most likely acts as inhibitor and K+ as intermediate in SERCAs reaction cycle, based on a best-fit state model of SERCA turnover. These findings provide a quantitative basis for SERCA function that leverages molecular-scale thermodynamic data and rationalize enzyme activity across broad ranges of K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations.",

Our studies show that AAUAAA is recognized with ~1 nM affinity by the CPSF-160-WDR33-CPSF-30 ternary complex. Variations in the RNA sequence can greatly reduce the affinity. Similarly, mutations of residues that have van der Waals interactions with the bases of AAUAAA also lead to substantial reductions in affinity.

Swsap1-deficient cells show defects in DNA damage-induced RAD51 assembly during both mitosis and meiosis. Defective RAD51 assembly in SWSAP1-depleted cells is suppressed by the depletion of FIGNL1, an AAA+ ATPase, which binds to RAD51 as well as SWSAP1. Purified FIGNL1 promotes the dissociation of RAD51 from ssDNAs. The in vitro dismantling activity of FIGNL1 does not require its ATPase but depends on RAD51-binding, suggesting a novel mechanism of RAD51 filament remodelling. Purified SWSAP1 inhibits the RAD51-dismantling activity of FIGNL1. Taken together, our data suggest that SWSAP1 protects RAD51 filaments by antagonizing the anti-recombinase, FIGNL1.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing the efficacy of proteasome inhibitors is a central goal in myeloma therapy. We proposed that signaling-level responses after PI would reveal new mechanisms of action that could be therapeutically exploited. Unbiased phosphoproteomics after the PI carfilzomib surprisingly demonstrated the most prominent phosphorylation changes on splicing related proteins. Spliceosome modulation was invisible to RNA or protein abundance alone. Transcriptome analysis after PI demonstrated broad-scale intron retention, suggestive of spliceosome interference, as well as specific alternative splicing of protein homeostasis machinery components. These findings led us to evaluate direct spliceosome inhibition in myeloma, which synergized with carfilzomib and showed potent anti-tumor activity. Functional genomics and exome sequencing further supported the spliceosome as a specific vulnerability in myeloma. Our results propose splicing interference as an unrecognized modality of PI mechanism, reveal additional modes of spliceosome modulation, and suggest spliceosome targeting as a promising therapeutic strategy in myeloma.\n\nSignificanceNew ways to enhance PI efficacy are of major interest. We combine systems-level analyses to discover that PIs specifically interfere with splicing and that myeloma is selectively vulnerable to spliceosome inhibition. We reveal a new approach to advance myeloma therapy and uncover broader roles of splicing modulation in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Migration through constrictions can clearly rupture nuclei and mis-localize nuclear proteins but damage to DNA remains uncertain as does any effect on cell cycle. Here, myosin-II inhibition rescues rupture and partially rescues the DNA damage marker {gamma}H2AX, but an apparent delay in cell cycle is unaffected. Co-overexpression of multiple DNA repair factors and antioxidant inhibition of break formation also have partial effects, independent of rupture. However, there seems to be a bimodal dependence of cell cycle on DNA damage. Migration through custom-etched pores yields the same bimodal, with ~4-m pores causing intermediate levels of damage and cell cycle delay. Micronuclei (generated in faulty division) of the smallest diameter appear similar to ruptured nuclei, with high DNA damage and entry of chromatin-binding cGAS (cyclic-GMP-AMP-synthase) from cytoplasm but low repair factor levels. Increased genomic variation after constricted migration is quantified in expanding clones and is consistent with (mis)repair of excess DNA damage and subsequent proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Speaking is a sensorimotor behavior whose neural basis is difficult to study at the resolution of single neurons due to the scarcity of human intracortical measurements and the lack of animal models. We recorded from electrode arrays in the  hand knob area of motor cortex in people with tetraplegia. Neurons in this area, which have not previously been implicated in speech, modulated during speaking and during non-speaking movement of the tongue, lips, and jaw. This challenges whether the conventional model of a  motor homunculus division by major body regions extends to the single-neuron scale. Spoken words and syllables could be decoded from single trials, demonstrating the potential utility of intracortical recordings for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to restore speech. Two neural population dynamics features previously reported for arm movements were also present during speaking: a large initial condition-invariant signal, followed by rotatory dynamics. This suggests that common neural dynamical motifs may underlie movement of arm and speech articulators.",

    "abstract": "Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common childhood kidney cancer. To improve risk stratification and identify novel therapeutic targets for patients with WT, we used high-resolution mass spectrometry proteomics to identify urine tumor markers associated with WT relapse. We determined urine proteomes at diagnosis of 49 patients with WT, non-WT renal tumors, and age-matched controls, leading to the quantitation of 6,520 urine proteins. Supervised analysis revealed specific urine markers of renal rhabdoid tumors, kidney clear cell sarcomas, renal cell carcinomas, as well as those detected in cured and relapsed WT. In particular, urine prohibitin was significantly elevated at diagnosis in patients with relapsed as compared to cured WT. In a validation cohort of 139 patients, a specific urine prohibitin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that prohibitin concentrations greater than 998 ng/mL at diagnosis were significantly associated with ultimate WT relapse. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that prohibitin was highly expressed in primary WT specimens and associated with disease stage. Using functional genetic experiments, we found that prohibitin was required for the growth and survival of WT cells. Overexpression of prohibitin was sufficient to block intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis and to cause resistance to diverse chemotherapy drugs, at least in part by dysregulating factors that control apoptotic cytochrome c release from mitochondrial cristae. Thus, urine prohibitin may improve therapy stratification, non-invasive monitoring of treatment response and early disease detection. In addition, therapeutic targeting of chemotherapy resistance induced by prohibitin dysregulation may offer improved therapies for patients with Wilms and other relapsed or refractory tumors.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIdentification of host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) can reveal mechanistic insights of infectious diseases for potential treatments and drug discoveries. Current computational methods for the prediction of HPIs often rely on our knowledge on the sequences and functions of pathogen proteins, which is limited for many species, especially for emerging pathogens. Matching the phenotypes elicited by pathogens with phenotypes associated with host proteins might improve the prediction of HPIs.\n\nResultsWe developed an ontology-based machine learning method that predicts potential interaction protein partners for pathogens. Our method exploits information about disease mechanisms through features learned from phenotypic, functional and taxonomic knowledge about pathogens and human proteins. Additionally, by embedding the phenotypic information of the pathogens within a formal representation of pathogen taxonomy, we demonstrate that our model can accurately predict interaction partners for pathogens without known phenotypes, using a combination of their taxonomic relationships with other pathogens and information from ontologies as background knowledge. Our results show that the integration of phenotypic, functional and taxonomic knowledge not only improves the prediction of HPIs, but also enables us to investigate novel pathogens in emerging infectious diseases.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/hpi-predict\n\nContactrobert.hoehndorf@kaust.edu.sa",
