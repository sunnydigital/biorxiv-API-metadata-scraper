    "abstract": "Systematically organizing the anatomical, molecular, and physiological properties of cortical neurons is important for understanding their computational functions. Hippocampome.org defines 122 neuron types in the rodent hippocampal formation (dentate gyrus, CA3, CA2, CA1, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex) based on their somatic, axonal, and dendritic locations, putative excitatory/inhibitory outputs, molecular marker expression, and biophysical properties such as time constant and input resistance. Here we augment the electrophysiological data of this knowledge base by collecting, quantifying, and analyzing the firing responses to depolarizing current injections for every hippocampal neuron type from available published experiments. We designed and implemented objective protocols to classify firing patterns based on both transient and steady-state activity. Specifically, we identified 5 transients (delay, adapting spiking, rapidly adapting spiking, transient stuttering, and transient slow-wave bursting) and 4 steady states (non-adapting spiking, persistent stuttering, persistent slow-wave bursting, and silence). By characterizing the set of all firing responses reported for hippocampal neurons, this automated classification approach revealed 9 unique families of firing pattern phenotypes while distinguishing potential new neuronal subtypes. Several novel statistical associations also emerged between firing responses and other electrophysiological properties, morphological features, and molecular marker expression. The firing pattern parameters, complete experimental conditions (including solution and stimulus details), digitized spike times, exact reference to the original empirical evidence, and analysis scripts are released open-source through Hippocampome.org for all neuron types, greatly enhancing the existing search and browse capabilities. This information, collated online in human-and machine-accessible form, will help design and interpret both experiments and hippocampal model simulations.\\n\\nSignificance StatementComprehensive characterization of nerve cells is essential for understanding signal processing in biological neuronal networks. Firing patterns are important identification characteristics of neurons and play crucial roles in information coding in neural systems. Building upon the comprehensive knowledge base Hippocampome.org, we developed and implemented automated protocols to classify all known firing responses exhibited by each neuron type of the rodent hippocampus based on analysis of transient and steady-state activity. This approach identified the most distinguishing elements of every firing phenotype and revealed previously unnoticed statistical associations of firing responses with other electrophysiological, morphological, and molecular properties. The resulting data, freely released online, constitute a powerful resource for designing and interpreting experiments as well as developing and testing hippocampal models.",

    "abstract": "In crown group tetrapods, individual digits are homologized in relation to a pentadactyl ground plan. However, testing hypotheses of digit homology is challenging because it is unclear whether digits develop with distinct and conserved gene regulatory states. Here we show dramatic evolutionary dynamism in the gene expression profiles of digits, challenging the notion that five digit identities are conserved across amniotes. Transcriptomics of developing limbs shows diversity in the patterns of genetic differentiation of digits, although the anterior-most digit of the pentadactyl limb has a unique, conserved expression profile. Further, we identify a core set of transcription factors that are differentially expressed among the digits of amniote limbs; their spatial expression domains, however, vary between species. In light of these results, we reevaluate the frame shift hypothesis of avian wing evolution and conclude that only the identity of the anterior-most digit has shifted position, suggesting a 1,3,4 digit identity in the bird wing.",

    "abstract": "Patterns of trait distribution among competing species can potentially reveal the processes that allow them to coexist. It has been recently proposed that competition may drive the spontaneous emergence of niches comprising clusters of similar species, in contrast with the dominant paradigm of greater-than-chance species differences. However, current clustering theory relies largely on heuristic rather than mechanistic models. Furthermore, studies of models incorporating demographic stochasticity and immigration, two key players in community assembly, did not observe clusters. Here we demonstrate clustering under partitioning of resources, partitioning of environmental gradients, and a competition-colonization tradeoff. We show that clusters are robust to demographic stochasticity, and can persist under immigration. While immigration may sustain clusters that are otherwise transient, too much dilutes the pattern. In order to detect and quantify clusters in nature, we introduce and validate metrics which have no free parameters nor require arbitrary trait binning, and weigh species by their abundances rather than relying on a presence-absence count. By generalizing beyond the circumstances where clusters have been observed, our study contributes to establishing them as an update to classical trait patterning theory.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySpecies traits determine how they compete with each other. As such, patterns in the distributions of traits in a community of competing species may reveal the processes responsible for coexistence. One central idea in theoretical ecology is that the strength of competition relates to similarity in species needs and strategies, and therefore if competition plays out at short timescales, coexisting species should be more different than expected by chance. However, recent theory suggests that competition may lead species to temporarily self-organize into groups with similar traits. Here we show that this clustering is a generic feature of competitive dynamics, which is robust to demographic stochasticity and can be indefinitely maintained by immigration. We show that clustering arises whether species coexist by partitioning resources, environmental preferences, or through tradeoffs in life-history strategies. We introduce and validate metrics that, given species traits and abundances, determine whether they are clustered, and if so, how many clusters occur. By showing the generality of self-organized species clusters and providing a tools for their detection, our study contributes to updating classical ideas about how competition shapes communities, and motivates searches for them in nature.",

Heritability of structural changes of WM tracts has been examined using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in family-based studies for different age groups. The availability of genetic and DTI data from recent large population-based studies offers opportunity to further improve our understanding of genetic contributions. Here, we analyzed the genetic architecture of WM tracts using DTI and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of unrelated individuals in the UK Biobank (n [~] 8000). The DTI parameters were generated using the ENIGMA-DTI pipeline. We found that DTI parameters are substantially heritable on most WM tracts. We observed a highly polygenic or omnigenic architecture of genetic influence across the genome as well as the enrichment of SNPs in active chromatin regions. Our bivariate analyses showed strong genetic correlations for several pairs of WM tracts as well as pairs of DTI parameters. We performed voxel-based analysis to illustrate the pattern of genetic effects on selected parts of the tract-based spatial statistics skeleton. Comparing the estimates from the UK Biobank to those from small population-based studies, we illustrated that sufficiently large sample size is essential for genetic architecture discovery in imaging genetics. We confirmed this finding with a simulation study.",

Recent studies have separately highlighted a correlation of platelet activation with TB severity and utility of aspirin as a host-directed therapy for TB that modulates the inflammatory response. Here we investigate the possibility that the beneficial effects of aspirin are related to an anti-platelet mode of action. We utilize the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum model to show mycobacteria drive host hemostasis through the formation of granulomas. Treatment of infected zebrafish with aspirin or platelet-specific glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors reduced mycobacterial burden demonstrating a detrimental role for infection-induced thrombocyte activation. We found platelet inhibition reduced thrombocyte-macrophage interactions and restored indices of macrophage-mediated immunity to mycobacterial infection. Pathological thrombocyte activation and granuloma formation were found to be intrinsically linked illustrating a bidirectional relationship between host hemostasis and TB pathogenesis.

After more than a decade of genome-wide association study efforts, these can account for only a fraction of the heritability implied by familial studies, the so-called \\\"missing heritability\\\" problem.\\n\\nMethodsComputer simulations of polygenic late-onset diseases in an aging population have quantified the risk allele frequency decrease at older ages caused by individuals with higher polygenic risk scores becoming ill proportionately earlier. This effect is most prominent for diseases characterized by high cumulative incidence and high heritability, examples of which include Alzheimers disease, coronary artery disease, cerebral stroke, and type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nResultsThe incidence rate for late-onset diseases grows exponentially for decades after early onset ages, guaranteeing that the cohorts used for genome-wide association studies overrepresent older individuals with lower polygenic risk scores, whose disease cases are disproportionately due to environmental causes such as old age itself. This mechanism explains the decline in clinical predictive power with age and the lower discovery power of familial studies of heritability and genome-wide association studies. It also explains the relatively constant-with-age heritability found for late-onset diseases of lower prevalence, exemplified by cancers.\\n\\nConclusionsFor late-onset polygenic diseases showing high cumulative incidence together with high initial heritability, rather than using relatively old age-matched cohorts, study cohorts combining the youngest possible cases with the oldest possible controls may significantly improve the discovery power of genome-wide association studies.",

Bacterial biofilms represent a major obstacle in the fight against bacterial infections as they are inherently refractory to many types of antibiotics. Treating biofilms with phage has shown promise in a handful of experimental and case studies. However, quantification of the effect of phage combined with antibiotics is needed to pave the way for larger clinical trials. Here we explore the effect of using phage in combination with a total of nine antibiotics, applied simultaneously or as a pretreatment before antibiotics are applied to in vitro biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus. Most antibiotics alone were ineffective at low concentration (2xMIC), but the addition of phage to treatment regimens led to substantial improvements in efficacy. At high concentration (10xMIC), antibiotics alone were effective, and in most cases the addition of phage to treatment regimens did not improve efficacy. Using phage with rifampin was also very effective at reducing the outgrowth of resistant strains during the course of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factor (TF) activity is an important read-out of cellular signalling pathways and thus to assess regulatory differences across conditions. However, current technologies lack the ability to simultaneously assess activity changes for multiple TFs and in particular to determine whether a specific TF acts globally as transcriptional repressor or activator. To this end, we introduce a widely applicable genome-wide method diffTF to assess differential TF activity and to classify TFs as activator or repressor (available at https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg/diffTF). This is done by integrating any type of genome-wide chromatin accessibility data with RNA-Seq data and in-silico predicted TF binding sites. We corroborated the classification of TFs into repressors and activators by three independent analyses based on enrichments of active/repressive chromatin states, correlation of TF activity with gene expression, and activator-and repressor-specific chromatin footprints. To show the power of diffTF, we present two case studies: First, we applied diffTF in to a large ATAC-Seq/RNA-Seq dataset comparing mutated and unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples, where we identified dozens of known (40%) and potentially novel (60%) TFs that are differentially active. We were also able to classify almost half of them as either repressor and activator. Second, we applied diffTF to a small ATAC-Seq/RNA-Seq data set comparing two cell types along the hematopoietic differentiation trajectory (multipotent progenitors - MPP - versus granulocyte-macrophage progenitors - GMP). Here we identified the known drivers of differentiation and found that the majority of the differentially active TFs are transcriptional activators. Overall, diffTF was able to recover the known TFs in both case studies, additionally identified TFs that have been less well characterized in the given condition, and provides a classification of the TFs into transcriptional activators and repressors.",

A number of protein extraction methods have been applied to various biological samples. TCA/acetone precipitation and phenol extraction, a common method of protein extraction, is thought to minimize protein degradation and activity of proteases as well as reduce contaminants like salts and polyphenols. However, the TCA/acetone precipitation method relies on the complete pulverization and repeated rinsing of tissue powder to remove the interfering substances, which is laborious and time-consuming. In addition, by prolonged incubation in TCA/acetone, the precipitated proteins are more difficult to re-dissolve. We have described a modified method of TCA/acetone precipitation of plant proteins for proteomic analysis. Proteins of cells or tissues were extracted using SDS-containing buffer, precipitated with equal volume of 20% TCA/acetone, and washed with acetone. Compared to classical TCA/acetone precipitation and simple acetone precipitation, this protocol generates comparable yields, spot numbers, and proteome profiling, but takes less time (ca. 45 min), thus avoiding excess protein modification and degradation after extended-period incubation in TCA/acetone or acetone. The modified TCA/acetone precipitation method is simple, fast, and suitable for proteomic analysis of various plant tissues in proteomic analysis.",

    "abstract": "Predictive coding is a theoretical framework that provides a functional interpretation of top-down and bottom up interactions in sensory processing. The theory has suggested that specific frequency bands relay bottom-up and top-down information (e.g. \\\"{gamma} up, {beta} down\\\"). But it remains unclear whether this notion generalizes to cross-frequency interactions. Furthermore, most of the evidence so far comes from visual pathways. Here we examined cross-frequency coupling across four sectors of the auditory hierarchy in the macaque. We computed two measures of cross-frequency coupling, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC). Our findings revealed distinct patterns for bottom-up and top-down information processing among cross-frequency interactions. Both top-down and bottom-up made prominent use of low frequencies: low-to-low frequency ({theta}, , {beta}) and low frequency-to-high {gamma} couplings were predominant top-down, while low frequency-to-low {gamma} couplings were predominant bottom-up. These patterns were largely preserved across coupling types (PAC and AAC) and across stimulus types (natural and synthetic auditory stimuli), suggesting they are a general feature of information processing in auditory cortex. Moreover, our findings showed that low-frequency PAC alternated between predominantly top-down or bottom-up over time. Altogether, this suggests sensory information need not be propagated along separate frequencies upwards and downwards. Rather, information can be unmixed by having low frequencies couple to distinct frequency ranges in the target region, and by alternating top-down and bottom-up processing over time.\\n\\n1 SignificanceThe brain consists of highly interconnected cortical areas, yet the patterns in directional cortical communication are not fully understood, in particular with regards to interactions between different signal components across frequencies. We employed a a unified, computationally advantageous Granger-causal framework to examine bi-directional cross-frequency interactions across four sectors of the auditory cortical hierarchy in macaques. Our findings extend the view of cross-frequency interactions in auditory cortex, suggesting they also play a prominent role in top-down processing. Our findings also suggest information need not be propagated along separate channels up and down the cortical hierarchy, with important implications for theories of information processing in the brain such as predictive coding.",

    "abstract": "The sensation of touch in the glabrous skin of the human hand is conveyed by thousands of fast-conducting mechanoreceptive afferents, which can be categorised into four distinct types. The spiking properties of these afferents in the periphery in response to varied tactile stimuli are well-characterised, but relatively little is known about the spatiotemporal properties of the neural representations of these different receptor types in the human cortex. Here, we use the novel methodological combination of single-unit intraneural microstimulation (INMS) with magnetoencephalography (MEG) to localise cortical representations of individual touch afferents in humans, by measuring the extracranial magnetic fields from neural currents. We found that by assessing the modulation of the beta (13-30 Hz) rhythm during single-unit INMS, significant changes in oscillatory amplitude occur in the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex within and across a group of fast adapting type I mechanoreceptive 20 afferents, which corresponded well to the induced response from matched vibrotactile stimulation. Combining the spatiotemporal specificity of MEG with the selective single-unit stimulation of INMS enables the interrogation of the central representations of different aspects of tactile afferent signalling within the human cortices. The fundamental finding that single-unit INMS ERD responses are robust and consistent with natural somatosensory stimuli will permit us to more dynamically probe the central nervous system responses in humans, to address questions about the processing of touch from the different classes of mechanoreceptive afferents and the effects of varying the stimulus frequency and patterning.",

The human anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) responds while experiencing pain in the self and witnessing pain in others, but underlying cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood.

Deactivating this region reduces freezing while witnessing footshocks to others but not while hearing the CS. A decoder trained on spike counts while witnessing footshocks can decode the animals own pain intensity when experiencing pain.

    "abstract": "The balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone provides exquisite control of heart rate and contractility and has also been shown to modulate coronary flow and inflammation. Understanding how autonomic balance is altered by cardiac disease is an active area of research and developing new ways to control this balance is providing insights into disease therapies. However, achieving acute neuron-specific stimulation of autonomic neurons can be difficult in experiments that measure the acute effects of nerve stimulation on the heart. Conventional electrical and pharmacological approaches can be spatially and temporally non-selective. Cell-specific expression of light-activated channels (channelrhodopsin, ChR2) is a powerful approach that enables control of the timing and distribution of cellular stimulation using light. We present such an optogenetic approach where parasympathetic cardiac neurons are selectively photoactivated at high temporal precision to initiate cholinergic-mediated slowing of heart rate.\\n\\nMice were crossbred to express ChR2 in peripheral cholinergic neurons using Cre-Lox recombination driven by a choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) promoter. Hearts from adult mice were excised, perfused, and the epicardium was illuminated (peak 460-465nm) to photoactivate ChR2. In one set of studies, hearts were illuminated using a large-field LED light source. In other studies, a micro LED was placed on the right atrium to selectively illuminate the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium. The ECG was acquired before, during, and after tissue illumination to measure changes in heart rate. Upon illumination, hearts exhibited sudden and dramatic reductions in heart rate with restoration of normal heart rate after cessation of illumination. Delays in atrioventricular conduction were also observed. Heart rate reductions at the highest irradiance levels were similar to heart rate reductions caused by application of bethanechol (10{micro}M) or acetylcholine (800{micro}M). Atropine (50nM) completely blocked the effect of ChR2 photoactivation, confirming cholinergic mediation.\\n\\nOptogenetic activation of intrinsic parasympathetic neurons reduced heart rate in an immediate, dose-dependent fashion, resembling the slowing of sinus rate in response to acetylcholine. Our results demonstrate a new approach for controlling parasympathetic modulation of cardiac function by selectively activating the endogenous release of acetylcholine from intrinsic cardiac cholinergic neurons.\\n\\nKey MessageOptogenetic photoactivation of intrinsic cardiac neurons provides immediate, tissuespecific stimulation with minimal cross-reactivity. Our results demonstrate that selective expression of channelrhodopsin within cardiac cholinergic neurons enables photoactivated release of acetylcholine, thereby instantaneously slowing sinus rate and altering atrioventricular conduction. This provides for indepth examination of the endogenous interplay between cardiac autonomic neurons and the functional outcomes of downstream post-synaptic receptor activation.",

    "abstract": "To better understand the representations in visual cortex, we need to generate better predictions of neural activity in awake animals presented with their ecological input: natural video. Despite recent advances in models for static images, models for predicting responses to natural video are scarce and standard linear-nonlinear models perform poorly. We developed a new deep recurrent network architecture that predicts inferred spiking activity of thousands of mouse V1 neurons simulta-neously recorded with two-photon microscopy, while accounting for confounding factors such as the animals gaze position and brain state changes related to running state and pupil dilation. Powerful system identification models provide an opportunity to gain insight into cortical functions through in silico experiments that can subsequently be tested in the brain. However, in many cases this approach requires that the model is able to generalize to stimulus statistics that it was not trained on, such as band-limited noise and other parameterized stimuli. We investigated these domain transfer properties in our model and find that our model trained on natural images is able to correctly predict the orientation tuning of neurons in responses to artificial noise stimuli. Finally, we show that we can fully generalize from movies to noise and maintain high predictive performance on both stimulus domains by fine-tuning only the final layers weights on a network otherwise trained on natural movies.

    "abstract": "Social transmission of distress has been conceived of as a one-way phenomenon in which an observer catches the emotions of another. Here we use a paradigm in which an observer rat witnesses another receive electro-shocks. Bayesian model comparison and Granger causality argue against this one-way vision in favor of bidirectional information transfer: how the observer reacts to the demonstrators distress influences the behavior of the demonstrator. Intriguingly, this was true to a similar extent across highly familiar and entirely unfamiliar rats. Injecting muscimol in the anterior cingulate of observers reduced freezing in the observers and in the demonstrators receiving the shocks. That rats share the distress of unfamiliar strains is at odds with evolutionary thinking that empathy should be biased towards close individuals. Using simulations, we support the complementary notion that distress transmission could be selected to more efficiently detect dangers in a group.",

    "abstract": "In many areas of the brain, both spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity can manifest as synchronous activation of neuronal ensembles. The characterization of ensemble structure and dynamics provides important insights into how brain computations are distributed across neural networks. The proliferation of experimental techniques for recording the activity of neuronal ensembles calls for a comprehensive statistical method to describe, analyze and characterize these high dimensional datasets. Here we introduce a generative model of synchronous activity to describe spontaneously active neural ensembles. Unlike existing methods, our analysis provides a simultaneous estimation of ensemble composition, dynamics and statistical features of these neural populations, including ensemble noise and activity rate. We also introduce ensemble \\\"coherence\\\" as a measure of within-ensemble synchrony. We have used our method to characterize population activity throughout the tectum of larval zebrafish, allowing us to make statistical inference on the spatiotemporal organization of tectal ensembles, their composition and the logic of their interactions. We have also applied our method to functional imaging and neuropixels recordings from the mouse, allowing us to relate the activity of identified ensembles to specific behaviours such as running or changes in pupil diameter.",

    "abstract": "Plant plasma-membrane (PM) proteins are involved in several vital processes, such as detection of pathogens, solute transport and cellular signalling. Recent models suggest that for these proteins to function effectively there needs to be structure within the PM allowing, for example, proteins in the same signalling cascade to be spatially organized. Here we demonstrate that several proteins with divergent functions are located in clusters of differing size in the membrane using sub-diffraction-limited Airyscan confocal microscopy. In addition, single particle tracking reveals that these proteins move at different rates within the membrane. We show that the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons appear to significantly regulate the mobility of one of these proteins (the pathogen receptor FLS2) and we further demonstrate that the cell wall is critical for the regulation of cluster size by affecting single particle dynamics of two proteins with key roles in morphogenesis (PIN3) and pathogen perception (FLS2). We propose a model in which the cell wall and cytoskeleton are pivotal for differentially regulating protein cluster size and dynamics thereby contributing to the formation and functionality of membrane nanodomains.\\n\\nOne sentence summarySize and mobility of protein nanodomains in the plant plasma-membrane are regulated by interaction with the cell wall extracellular matrix.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe plant plasma membrane acts as the front line for cellular perception of the environment. As such, a large number of signalling and transport proteins which perceive or transport environmental signals, developmental cues and nutrients are located within it. Recently, a number of studies have revealed that proteins located within the plasma membrane do not simply freely diffuse within its plane. Rather, proteins are localized in nanometer sized structures called nanodomains. In addition to the plasma-membrane, plant cells also have an extracellular matrix, the cell wall. Here we have shown that the cell wall has a role in regulating the dynamics and size of plasma membrane nanodomains for proteins involved in morphogenesis (PIN3) and pathogen perception (FLS2).",

    "abstract": "Forest models often reflect the dominant management paradigm of their time. Until the late 1970s, this meant sustaining yields. Following landmark work in forest ecology, physiology, and biogeochemistry, the current generation of models is further intended to inform ecological and climatic forest management in alignment with national biodiversity and climate mitigation targets. This has greatly increased the complexity of models used to inform management, making them difficult to diagnose and understand. State-of-the-art forest models are often complex, analytically intractable, and computationally-expensive, due to the explicit representation of detailed biogeochemical and ecological processes. Different models often produce distinct results while predictions from the same model vary with parameter values. In this project, we developed a rigorous quantitative approach for conducting model intercomparisons and assessing model performance. We have applied our original methodology to compare two forest biogeochemistry models, the Perfect Plasticity Approximation with Simple Biogeochemistry (PPA-SiBGC) and Landscape Disturbance and Succession with Net Ecosystem Carbon and Nitrogen (LANDIS-II NECN). We simulated past-decade conditions at flux tower sites located within Harvard Forest, MA, USA (HF-EMS) and Jones Ecological Research Center, GA, USA (JERC-RD). We mined field data available for both sites to perform model parameterization, validation, and intercomparison. We assessed model performance using the following time-series metrics: net ecosystem exchange, aboveground net primary production, aboveground biomass, C, and N, belowground biomass, C, and N, soil respiration, and, species total biomass and relative abundance. We also assessed static observations of soil organic C and N, and concluded with an assessment of general model usability, performance, and transferability. Despite substantial differences in design, both models achieved good accuracy across the range of pool metrics. While LANDIS-II NECN showed better fidelity to interannual NEE fluxes, PPA-SiBGC indicated better overall performance for both sites across the 11 temporal and 2 static metrics tested (HF-EMS [Formula] = 0.73, +0.07, [Formula] = 4.84, -10.02; JERC-RD [Formula] = 0.76, +0.04, [Formula] = 2.69, -1.86). To facilitate further testing of forest models at the two sites, we provide pre-processed datasets and original software written in the R language of statistical computing. In addition to model intercomparisons, our approach may be employed to test modifications to forest models and their sensitivity to different parameterizations.",

    "abstract": "PurposeAmpliSeq technology, the target enrichment method for next-generation sequencing (NGS), enables quick and easy detection of the genomic \\\"hot spot\\\" region frequently mutated in species. Even though the cost of NGS has decreased, library preparation cost accounts for a more significant proportion of the total cost. If AmpliSeq library can be prepared at a lower cost, large-scale precision oncology can be more easily carried out. Furthermore, this technology can be widely applied not only to medical research, but also to polymorphism detection in biology. This study aimed to reduce the cost of AmpliSeq library preparation by adopting miniaturization technology.\\n\\nMethodsWe used approximately 10 ng of genomic DNA for ultra-multiplex PCR of 384, 768, 1152, 1920, and 3072 amplicons. Multiplex PCR was performed in a total volume of 1.6, 2.0, and 2.4 L, using a nano-liter liquid handler, for library preparation.\\n\\nResultsThe success rate of library construction decreased with decreasing total multiplex PCR reaction volume. Using 1.6-, 2.0-, and 2.4-L reactions, the success rates of ultra-multiplex PCR were 25%, 95%, and 100%, respectively. We could stably create libraries of the correct amplicon size, with an amplicon number of approximately 1500 or less. As a result of NGS, uniformity of PCR amplification and read length of quality-checked libraries were hardly affected by the number of amplicons.\\n\\nConclusionHere, we show that the minimum volume for a stable reaction was 2.4 L and the maximum number of amplicons obtained was approximately 1500. The protocol saved 86.8% in reagent usage and reduced handling time by 85% compared to that required by the manual protocol. Therefore, miniaturization technologies could reduce the cost of AmpliSeq library preparation through minimization of reagents.",

    "abstract": "The impermeability of the luminal endothelial cell monolayer is crucial for the normal performance of the vascular and lymphatic systems. A key to this function is the integrity of the monolayers intercellular junctions. The known repertoire of junction-regulating genes is incomplete.

To overcome these limitations, we designed a new permeability assay that consists of cell monolayers grown on [~]150 m microcarriers. Each microcarrier functions as a miniature individual assay of permeability (MAP). We demonstrate that false-positive results can be minimized, and that MAP sensitivity to thrombin-induced increase in monolayer permeability is similar to the sensitivity of the measurement of impedance. We validate the assay by showing that the expression of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that target genes encoding known thrombin signaling proteins blocks effectively thrombin-induced junction disassembly, and that MAPs carrying such cells can be separated effectively by a fluorescent probe from those that carry cells expressing non-targeting sgRNAs. These results indicate that MAPs are suitable for high-throughput experimentation and for genome-wide screens for genes that mediate the disruptive effect of thrombin on endothelial cell junctions.",

    "abstract": "The coordinated spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression in the vertebrate neural tube determines the identity of neural progenitors and the function and physiology of the neurons they generate. Progress has been made deciphering the gene regulatory programmes responsible for this process, however, the complexity of the tissue has hampered the systematic analysis of the network and the underlying mechanisms. To address this, we used single cell mRNA sequencing to profile cervical and thoracic regions of the developing mouse neural tube between embryonic days (e)9.5-e13.5. We confirmed the data accurately recapitulates neural tube development, allowing us to identify new markers for specific progenitor and neuronal populations. In addition, the analysis highlighted a previously underappreciated temporal component to the mechanisms generating neuronal diversity and revealed common features in the sequence of transcriptional events that lead to the differentiation of specific neuronal subtypes. Together the data provide a compendium of gene expression for classifying spinal cord cell types that will support future studies of neural tube development, function, and disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCattle populations are highly amenable to the genetic mapping of male reproductive traits because longitudinal data on ejaculate quality and dense microarray-derived genotypes are available for many artificial insemination bulls. Two young Nordic Red bulls delivered sperm with low progressive motility (i.e., asthenospermia) during a semen collection period of more than four months. The bulls were related through a common ancestor on both their paternal and maternal ancestry. Thus, a recessive mode of inheritance of asthenospermia was suspected.\n\nResultsBoth bulls were genotyped at 54,001 SNPs using the Illumina BovineSNP50 Bead chip. A scan for autozygosity revealed that they were identical by descent for a 2.98 Mb segment located on bovine chromosome 25. This haplotype was not found in the homozygous state in 8,557 fertile bulls although five homozygous haplotype carriers were expected (P=0.018). Whole genome-sequencing uncovered that both asthenospermic bulls were homozygous for a mutation that disrupts a canonical 5 splice donor site of CCDC189 encoding the coiled-coil domain containing protein 189. Transcription analysis showed that the derived allele activates a cryptic splice site resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of translation. The mutated CCDC189 protein is truncated by more than 40%, thus lacking the flagellar C1a complex subunit C1a-32 that is supposed to modulate the physiological movement of the sperm flagella. The mutant allele occurs at a frequency of 2.5% in Nordic Red cattle.\n\nConclusionsOur study in cattle uncovered that CCDC189 is required for physiological movement of sperm flagella thus enabling active progression of spermatozoa and fertilization. A direct gene test may be implemented to monitor the asthenospermia-associated allele and prevent the birth of homozygous bulls that are infertile. Our results have been integrated in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA) database (https://omia.org/OMIA002167/9913/).",

Originally, telomerase activity was only detected in cancer cells but is now recognized as being detectable in transit amplifying cells in tissues undergoing regeneration or in extreme conditions of wound repair. Here we report that in vitro low stress culture conditions allow normal human lung basal epithelial cells to grow for over 200 population doublings without engaging any telomere maintenance mechanism.

    "abstract": "Success in precision medicine depends on our ability to determine which rare human genetic variants have functional effects. Classical homocystinuria--characterized by elevated homocyst(e)ine in plasma and urine--is caused by primarily-rare variants in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene. About half of patients respond to vitamin B6 therapy. With early detection in newborns, existing therapies are highly effective. Functional CBS variants, especially those that respond to vitamin B6, can be detected based on their ability to restore growth in yeast cells lacking CYS4 (the yeast ortholog of CBS). This assay has previously been carried out only  reactively after first observation of a variant in patients. Here we describe a  proactive comprehensive missense variant effect map for human CBS. Together, saturation codon-replacement mutagenesis, en masse growth selection at different vitamin B6 levels, and sequencing yielded a  look-up table for CBS missense variant function and vitamin B6-remediability in yeast. The CBS variant effect map identified disease variants and predicted both disease severity (r = 0.82) and human clinical response to vitamin B6 (r = 0.89). Thus, highly-multiplexed cell-based assays can yield proactive maps of variant function and patient response to therapy, even for rare variants not previously seen in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Early marine survival of juvenile salmon is intimately associated with their physiological condition during ocean entry and especially smoltification. Smoltification is a developmental parr-smolt transformation allowing salmon to acquire the trait of seawater tolerance in preparation for marine living. Traditionally, this developmental process has been monitored using gill Na+/K+ATPase (NKA) activity or plasma hormones, but gill gene expression can be reliably used. Here, we describe the discovery of candidate genes from gill tissue for staging smoltification using comparisons of microarray studies with particular focus on the commonalities between anadromous Rainbow trout and Sockeye salmon datasets, as well as literature comparison encompassing more species. A subset of 37 candidate genes mainly from the microarray analyses was used for Taq-Man qPCR assay design and their monthly expression patterns were validated using gill samples from four groups, representing three species and two ecotypes: Coho salmon, Sockeye salmon, stream-type Chinook salmon, and ocean-type Chinook salmon. The best smoltification biomarkers, as measured by consistent changes across these four groups, were genes involved in ion regulation, oxygen transport, and immunity. Smoltification gene expression patterns (using the top 10 biomarkers) were confirmed by significant correlations with NKA activity and were associated with changes in body brightness, caudal fin darkness, and caudal peduncle length. We incorporate gene expression patterns of pre-smolt, smolt, and de-smolt trials from acute seawater transfers using a companion study to develop a preliminary seawater tolerance classification model for ocean-type Chinook salmon. This work demonstrates the potential of gene expression biomarkers to stage smoltification and classify juveniles as pre-smolt, smolt, or de-smolt.",

    "abstract": "Examination of large-scale distributed networks within the individual reveals details of cortical network organization that are absent in group-averaged studies. One recent discovery is that a distributed transmodal network, often referred to as the  default network, is comprised of two separate but closely interdigitated networks, only one of which is coupled to posterior parahippocampal cortex. Not all studies of individuals have identified the same networks and questions remain about the degree to which the two networks are separate, particularly within regions hypothesized to be interconnected hubs. Here we replicate the observation of network separation across analytical (seed-based connectivity and parcellation) and data projection (volume and surface) methods in 2 individuals each scanned 31 times. Additionally, 3 individuals were examined with high-resolution fMRI to gain further insight into the anatomical details. The two networks were identified with separate regions localized to adjacent portions of the cortical ribbon, sometimes inside the same sulcus. Midline regions previously implicated as hubs revealed near complete spatial separation of the two networks, displaying a complex spatial topography in the posterior cingulate and precuneus. The network coupled to parahippocampal cortex also revealed a separate region directly within the hippocampus at or near the subiculum. These collective results support that the default network is composed of at least two spatially juxtaposed networks. Fine spatial details and juxta-positions of the two networks can be identified within individuals at high resolution, providing insight into the network organization of association cortex and placing further constraints on interpretation of group-averaged neuroimaging data.",

    "abstract": "Parvalbumin (PV) positive interneurons modulate cortical activity through highly specialized connectivity patterns onto excitatory pyramidal neurons (PNs) and other inhibitory cells. PV cells are auto-connected through powerful autapses, but the contribution of this form of fast disinhibition to cortical function is unknown. We found that autaptic transmission represents the most powerful input of PV cells in neocortical Layer V. Autaptic strength was greater than synaptic strength onto PNs as result of a larger quantal size, whereas autaptic and heterosynaptic PV-PV synapses differed in the number of release sites. Overall, single-axon autaptic transmission contributed to ~40% of the total perisomatic inhibition that PV interneurons received. The strength of autaptic transmission modulated the coupling of PV-cell firing with optogenetically-induced {gamma}-oscillations preventing high frequency bursts of spikes. Autaptic self-inhibition represents an exceptionally large and fast disinhibitory mechanism to synchronize the output of PV cells during cognitive-relevant cortical network activity.",

By using regular LED illumination, we acquire the single lower-resolution image of the objects placed approximate to the sensor with unit fringe magnification. For the raw contact-mode lens-free image, the pixel size of the sensor chip limits the spatial resolution. We apply a generative and adversarial network (GAN), a type of deep learning algorithm, to circumvent this limitation and effectively recover much higher resolution image of the objects, permitting sub-micron spatial resolution to be achieved across the entire sensor chip active area, which is also equivalent to the imaging field-of-view (24 mm2) due to unit magnification. This GAN-contact imaging approach eliminates the need of either lens or multi-frame acquisition, being very handy and cost-effective. We demonstrate the success of this approach by imaging the proliferation dynamics of cells directly cultured on the chip.",

    "abstract": "In human sperm, a fraction of its chromatin retains nucleosomes that are positioned on specific sequences containing genes and regulatory units essential for embryonic development. This nucleosome positioning (NP) feature provides an inherited epigenetic mark for sperm. However, it is not known whether there is a structural constraint for these nucleosomes and, if so, how they are localized in a three-dimensional (3D) context of the sperm nucleus. In this study, we examine the 3D organization of sperm chromatin and specifically determine its 3D localization of nucleosomes using structured illumination microscopy. A fraction of the sperm chromatin form nucleosome domains (NDs), visible as microscopic puncta ranging from 40 m to 700 m in diameter, and these NDs are precisely localized in the postacrosome region (PAR), outside the sperms core chromatin. Importantly, these types of NDs exist only in sperm from fertile men but not in sperm from sterile men. This study uncovers a new spatially restricted sub-nuclear structure containing NDs that are consistent with NPs of the sperm. This represents a novel form of epigenetic mark for healthy sperms and can provide a potential new therapeutic and diagnostic target for treating male infertility.",

However, the reason for the association between APOE4 and AD remains unclear. While much of the research has focused on the ability of the apoE4 protein to increase the aggregation and decrease the clearance of A{beta}, there is also an abundance of data showing that APOE4 negatively impacts many additional processes in the brain, including bioenergetics. In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the APOE4s role in AD pathogenesis, we performed a multi-omic analysis of APOE4 vs. APOE3 expression in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and primary visual cortex (PVC) of aged APOE mice. These studies revealed region-specific alterations in several bioenergetic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), the TCA-cycle and fatty acid metabolism. Follow-up analysis utilizing the Seahorse platform revealed decreased mitochondrial respiration in the hippocampus and cortex of aged APOE4 vs. APOE3 mice, but not in the EC of these mice. Additional studies, as well as the original multi-omic data suggest that bioernergetic pathways in the EC of aged APOE mice may be differentially regulated by APOE4 expression. Given the importance of the EC as one of the first regions to be affected by AD pathology in humans, this differential bionenergetic regulation observed in the EC vs. other brain regions of aged APOE4 mice may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD, particularly among APOE4 carriers.",

Geneset and protein overrepresentation analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI), DEGs-Transcription Factor interactions, DEGs-MicroRNAs interactions, protein-drug interactions, and protein subcellular localizations analyses were done on common DEGs.\\n\\nResultsTotal 25 DEGs were detected between the two datasets. Integration of DEGs with biomolecular networks revealed hub proteins (TUBB, ATF3, NOL6, UQCRC1, SND1, CASP2, BTF3, INPP5K, VCAM1, and CSTF1), TFs (FOXC1, ZNF3, GEMIN7, and SMG9), miRNAs (mir-20a-5p, mir-93-5p, mir-16-5p, let-7b-5p, mir-708-5p, mir-24-3p, mir-26b-5p, mir-17-5p, mir-4270, and mir-4441).

The protein-drug interactions revealed 10 candidate drugs consisting of antineoplastic (Vinorelbine, Vincristine, Vinblastine, Epothilone D, Epothilone B, CYT997, and ZEN-012), dermatologicals (Podofilox), and immunosuppressive agents (Colchicine) that may target the candidate systems biomarkers. The subcellular localization analysis revealed the interactions of the DEGs range from nucleus to plasma membrane through cytosol.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study presents blood based systems molecular biomarker signatures at RNA and protein levels which might be useful as peripheral biomarkers in the AD. The candidate drugs, histone modification sites, and subcellular localizations will be useful in future drug design in the AD.",

    "abstract": "Optimal sensory decision-making requires the combination of uncertain sensory signals with prior expectations. The effect of prior probability is often described as a shift in the decision criterion. Can observers track sudden changes in probability? To answer this question, we used a change-point detection paradigm that is frequently used to examine behavior in changing environments. In a pair of orientation-categorization tasks, we investigated the effects of changing probabilities on decision-making. In both tasks, category probability was updated using a sample-and-hold procedure. We developed an ideal Bayesian change-point detection model in which the observer marginalizes over both the current run length (i.e., time since last change) and the current category probability. We compared this model to various alternative models that correspond to different strategies - from approximately Bayesian to simple heuristics - that the observers may have adopted to update their beliefs about probabilities. We find that probability is estimated following an exponential averaging model with a bias towards equal priors, consistent with a conservative bias. The mechanism underlying change of decision criterion is a combination of on-line estimation of prior probability and a stable, long-term equal-probability prior, thus operating at two very different timescales.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe demonstrate how people learn and adapt to changes to the probability of occurrence of one of two categories on decision-making under uncertainty. The study combined psychophysical behavioral tasks with computational modeling. We used two behavioral tasks: a typical forced-choice categorization task as well as one in which the observer specified the decision criterion to use on each trial before the stimulus was displayed. We formulated an ideal Bayesian change-point detection model and compared it to several alternative models. We found that the data are best fit by a model that estimates category probability based on recently observed exemplars with a bias towards equal probability. Our results suggest that the brain takes multiple relevant time scales into account when setting category expectations.",

    "abstract": "Molecular phylogenetics has neglected polymorphisms within present and ancestral populations for a long time. Recently, multispecies coalescent based methods have increased in popularity, however, their application is limited to a small number of species and individuals. We introduced a polymorphism-aware phylogenetic model (PoMo), which overcomes this limitation and scales well with the increasing amount of sequence data while accounting for present and ancestral polymorphisms. PoMo circumvents handling of gene trees and directly infers species trees from allele frequency data. Here, we extend the PoMo implementation in IQ-TREE and integrate search for the statistically best-fit mutation model, the ability to infer mutation rate variation across sites, and assessment of branch support values. We exemplify an analysis of a hundred species with ten haploid individuals each, showing that PoMo can perform inference on large data sets. While PoMo is more accurate than standard substitution models applied to concatenated alignments, it is almost as fast. We also provide bmm-simulate, a software package that allows simulation of sequences evolving under PoMo. The new options consolidate the value of PoMo for phylogenetic analyses with population data.",

    "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a state of unrelenting seizure activity. It is associated with a rapidly rising mortality rate, and thus constitutes a medical emergency. Benzodiazepines, which act as positive modulators of chloride (Cl-) permeable GABAA receptors, are indicated as the first line of treatment, but this is ineffective in many cases. We found that 48% of children presenting with SE were unresponsive to benzodiazepine treatment, and critically, that the duration of SE at the time of treatment is an important predictor of non-responsiveness. We therefore investigated the cellular mechanisms that underlie acquired benzodiazepine resistance, using rodent organotypic brain slices. Removing Mg2+ ions leads to an evolving pattern of epileptiform activity, and eventually to a persistent state of repetitive discharges that strongly resembles clinical EEG recordings of SE. We show that the persistent SE-like activity is associated with a reduction in GABAA receptor conductance and Cl- extrusion capability. We explored the effect on intraneuronal Cl- using both gramicidin, perforated-patch clamp recordings and Cl- imaging. This showed that during SE-like activity, reduced Cl- extrusion capacity was further exacerbated by activity-dependent Cl- loading, resulting in a persistently high intraneuronal Cl-. Consistent with these results, we found that optogenetic stimulation of GABAergic interneurons in the SE-like state, actually enhanced epileptiform activity in a GABAAR dependent manner. Together our findings describe a novel potential mechanism underlying benzodiazepine-resistant SE, with relevance to how this life-threatening condition should be managed in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria that engage in longstanding associations with particular hosts are expected to evolve host-specific adaptations that limit their capacity to thrive in other environments. Consistent with this, many gut symbionts seem to have a limited host range, based on community profiling and phylogenomics. However, few studies have experimentally investigated host specialization of gut symbionts and underlying mechanisms have largely remained elusive. Here, we studied host specialization of a dominant gut symbiont of social bees, Lactobacillus Firm5. We show that Firm5 strains isolated from honey bees and bumble bees separate into deep-branching phylogenetic lineages. Despite their divergent evolution, colonization experiments show that bumble bee strains are capable of colonizing the honey bee gut. However, they were less successful than honey bee strains, and competition with honey bee strains completely abolished their colonization, whereas honey bee strains were able to coexist. This suggests that both host selection and interbacterial competition play important roles for host specialization. Using comparative genomics of 27 Firm5 isolates, we identified candidate genomic changes underlying host specialization. We found that honey bee strains harbored a larger and more diverse gene pool of carbohydrate-related functions than bumble bee strains. As dietary-derived carbohydrates are the main energy source for strains of the Firm5 phylotype, the metabolic flexibility of honey bee strains may give these bacteria a competitive advantage over bumble bee strains in colonizing the gut niche and hence contribute to host specialization.",

In particular, they are parameterizable from quantities we can estimate such as the force of infection (FOI), the rate of natural recovery from a single infection, the treatment rate, and the rate of demographic turnover. However, malaria parasites can superinfect their host which has the effect of increasing the duration of infection before total recovery. Queueing theory has been applied to capture this behavior, but a problem with current queueing models is the exclusion of factors such as demographic turnover and treatment. These factors in particular can affect the entire shape of the distribution of the multiplicity of infection (MOI) generated by the superinfection process, its transient dynamics, and the population mean recovery rate. Here we show the distribution of MOI can be described by an alternative hyper-Poisson distribution. We then couple our resulting equations to a simple vector transmission model, extending previous Ross-Macdonald theory.",

Resolving the programs driving neurogenesis has been a major challenge owing to the complexity and rapidity with which distinct cell populations arise.

The resulting gene expression atlas comprises a detailed resource of global transcriptome dynamics that permits systematic analysis of how cells in the nervous system acquire distinct fates. We resolve known gene expression dynamics and uncover novel expression signatures for hundreds of genes among diverse neurogenic cell types, most of which remain unstudied. We also identified a set of conserved and processed long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that exhibit spatiotemporal expression during neurogenesis with exquisite specificity. LncRNA expression is highly dynamic and demarcates specific subpopulations within neurogenic cell types. Our spatiotemporal transcriptome atlas provides a comprehensive resource to investigate the function of coding genes and noncoding RNAs during critical stages of early neurogenesis.\\n\\nSummary statementWe present a spatiotemporal transcriptome during early Drosophila embryonic nervous system development, revealing a complex cell type-specific network of mRNAs and IncRNAs.",

The major immediate early promoter (MIEP) of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) drives the expression of crucial lytic cycle transactivators but is silenced during latency in hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Because the MIEP is poorly active in HPCs, it is unclear how viral transactivators are expressed during reactivation. We demonstrate that transcripts originating from alternative promoters within the canonical major immediate early locus are abundantly expressed upon reactivation, whereas MIEP-derived transcripts remain undetectable. Further, we show that these promoters are necessary for efficient reactivation in primary CD34+ HPCs.

    "abstract": "Virus-host interactions are frequently studied in bulk cell populations, obscuring cell-to-cell variation. Here we investigate endogenous herpesvirus gene expression at the single-cell level, combining a sensitive and robust fluorescent in situ hybridization platform with multiparameter flow cytometry, to study the expression of gammaherpesvirus non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) during lytic replication, latent infection and reactivation in vitro. This method allowed robust detection of viral ncRNAs of murine gammaherpesvirus 68 ({gamma}HV68), Kaposis sarcoma associated herpesvirus and Epstein-Barr virus, revealing variable expression at the single-cell level. By quantifying the inter-relationship of viral ncRNA, viral mRNA, viral protein and host mRNA regulation during {gamma}HV68 infection, we find heterogeneous and asynchronous gene expression during latency and reactivation, with reactivation from latency identified by a distinct gene expression profile within rare cells. Further, during lytic replication with {gamma}HV68, we find many cells have limited viral gene expression, with only a fraction of cells showing robust gene expression, dynamic RNA localization, and progressive infection. These findings, powered by single-cell analysis integrated with automated clustering algorithms, suggest inefficient or abortive {gamma}HV infection in many cells, and identify substantial heterogeneity in viral gene expression at the single-cell level.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARY\\n\\nThe gammaherpesviruses are a group of DNA tumor viruses that establish lifelong infection. How these viruses infect and manipulate cells has frequently been studied in bulk populations of cells. While these studies have been incredibly insightful, there is limited understanding of how virus infection proceeds within a single cell. Here we present a new approach to quantify gammaherpesvirus gene expression at the single-cell level. This method allows us to detect cell-to-cell variation in the expression of virus non-coding RNAs, an important and understudied class of RNAs which do not encode for proteins. By examining multiple features of virus gene expression, this method further reveals significant variation in infection between cells across multiple stages of infection. These studies emphasize that gammaherpesvirus infection can be surprisingly heterogeneous when viewed at the level of the individual cell. Because this approach can be broadly applied across diverse viruses, this study affords new opportunities to understand the complexity of virus infection within single cells.",

Micronuclei show aberrant nuclear envelopes that collapse, generating damaged DNA and promoting complex genome alterations. However, ruptured micronuclei also provide a pool of cytosolic DNA that stimulates anti-tumour immunity, revealing the complexity of micronuclei impact on tumour progression.\\n\\nThe ESCRT-III complex ensures nuclear envelope (NE) resealing during late mitosis and NE repair in interphase. Therefore, ESCRT-III activity maybe crucial for maintaining the integrity of other genomic structures enclosed by a nuclear envelope. ESCRT-III activity at the nuclear envelope is coordinated by the subunit CHMP7.\\n\\nWe show that CHMP7 and ESCRT-III protects against the genomic instability associated with micronuclei formation. Loss of ESCRT-III activity increases the population of micronuclei with ruptured nuclear envelopes, in interphase cells. Surprisingly, ESCRT-III is retained at acentric micronuclei suggesting that ESCRT-III cannot repair these structures. Depletion of CHMP7 expression removes ESCRT-III accumulations at ruptured micronuclei, and removes the population of micronuclei with damaged DNA also containing a sensor for cytosolic DNA.\\n\\nThus, ESCRT-III activity appears to protect from the consequence of genomic instability in a dichotomous fashion. Membrane repair activity prevents the occurrence of MN with weak envelopes; conversely, aberrant membrane remodelling at micronuclei generates a steady state pool of cytosolic DNA that may contribute to sustaining pro-inflammatory pathways in cancer cells.",

IL-22 also promotes wound healing and tissue regeneration, which can support the growth of colorectal tumours. Mutations in the tumour suppressor Adenomatous Polyposis Coli gene (Apc) cause intestinal tumorigenesis and are a major driver of familial colorectal cancers. To understand the role of IL-22 in APC-mediated tumorigenesis, we analysed IL-22 signalling in wild-type (WT) and APC-mutant cells in murine small intestinal epithelial organoids and in mice. In WT epithelia, antimicrobial defence, mucus production, and cellular stress response pathways were most strongly upregulated by IL-22. Surprisingly, we found that although IL-22 activated STAT3 in APC-mutant cells, STAT3 target genes were not effectively induced. Our analyses revealed that ApcMin/Min cells were resistant to IL-22 due to reduced expression of the IL-22 receptor, and increased expression of inhibitors of STAT3, including histone deacetylases. We further show that IL-22 induced expression of nitric oxide synthase in WT epithelial cells and corresponding DNA damage. These findings suggest that IL-22 does not promotes tumour formation by driving the proliferation of transformed intestinal epithelial cells. Rather, IL-22 increases genetic instability thereby accelerating transition from heterozygosity (ApcMin/+) to homozygosity (ApcMin/Min) to drive tumour progression.",

Despite numerous mechanisms to restrict vertebrate hosts IFN-I response, West Nile Virus (WNV) replication is sensitive to pre-treatment with IFN-I. However, the regulators and products of the IFN-I pathway important in regulating WNV replications are incompletely defined. Consistent with WNVs sensitivity to IFN-I, we found that in TRIM6 knockout (TRIM6 KO) A549 cells WNV replication is significantly increased. Additionally, induction of Ifnb mRNA was delayed and the expression of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) was reduced in TRIM6 KO cells. IFN{beta} pre-treatment was more effective in protecting against subsequent WNV infection in wt cells, indicating that TRIM6 contributes to the establishment of an IFN-induced antiviral response against WNV. Using next generation sequencing, we identified potential factors involved in this TRIM6-mediated antiviral response. One identified gene, VAMP8, is a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) in the vesicle-associated membrane protein subfamily. Knockdown of VAMP8 resulted in reduced STAT1 phosphorylation and impaired induction of several ISGs following WNV infection or IFN{beta} treatment. Therefore, VAMP8 is a novel gene involved in the regulation of IFN-I signaling, and its expression is dependent on TRIM6 function. Overall, these results indicate that TRIM6 contributes to the antiviral response against WNV by regulating the IFN-I system.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEWNV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that poses threat to human health across large discontinuous areas throughout the world. Infection with WNV results in febrile illness, which can progress to severe neurological disease. Currently, there are no approved treatment options to control WNV infection. Understanding the cellular immune responses that regulate viral replication is important in diversifying the resources available to control WNV. Here we show that the elimination of TRIM6 in human cells results in an increase in WNV replication and alters the expression and function of other components of the IFN-I pathway through VAMP8. Dissecting the interactions between WNV and host defenses both informs basic molecular virology and promotes the development of host- and viral-targeted antiviral strategies.",

    "abstract": "Current knowledge of the mechanisms of cell migration is based on differentiated cells in culture where it is known that the actomyosin machinery drives migration via dynamic interactions with the extracellular matrix and adhesion complexes. However, unlike differentiated cells, cells in early metazoan embryos must also dynamically change cell sizes as they migrate. The relevance of cell size to cell migration and embryonic development is not known. Here we investigate this phenomena in zebrafish embryos, a model system in which reductive cell divisions causes cell sizes to decrease naturally over time as cells migrate collectively to sculpt the embryonic body plan. We show that cell size reduction during early development follows power-law scaling. Because mutations that can perturb cell sizes so early in development do not exist, we generate haploid and tetraploid zebrafish embryos and show that cell sizes in such embryos are smaller and larger than the diploid norm, respectively. Cells in embryos made of smaller or larger than normal cells migrate sub-optimally, leading to gastrulation defects. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the observed defects originate from altered cell size rather than from pleotropic effects of altered ploidy. This interpretation is strengthened by the result wherein restoring cell sizes to normal diploid-like values rescues gastrulation defects. Live imaging of chimeric embryos where haploid/tetraploid cells are introduced into diploid embryos reveal the cell-autonomous nature of the migration defects. Additionally, aberrant intracellular actin dynamics with respect to the vectorial direction of motion suggests a cellular mechanism behind the migration defects. Taken together, early reductive cell divisions potentially allow dynamic, stage-specific cell size norms to emerge, which enables efficient collective cell migration to correctly position cells in space and time to shape an amorphous ball of blastoderm into an embryo.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are abundant in eukaryotic transcriptomes and have been linked to various human disorders. However, understanding genetic control of circular RNA expression is in early stages. Here we present the first integrated analysis of circRNAs and genome sequence variation from lymphoblastoid cell lines of the 1000 genomes project. We identified thousands of circRNAs in the RNA-seq data and show their association with local single nucleotide polymorphic sites, referred to as circQTLs, which influence the circRNA transcript abundance. Strikingly, we found that circQTLs exist independently of eQTLs with most circQTLs having no effect on mRNA expression. Only a fraction of the polymorphic sites are shared and linked to both circRNA and mRNA expression with mostly similar effects on circular and linear RNA. A shared intronic QTL, rs55928920, of HMSD gene drives the circular and linear expression in opposite directions, potentially modulating circRNA levels at the expense of mRNA. Finally, circQTLs and eQTLs are largely independent and exist in separate linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks with circQTLs highly enriched for functional genomic elements and regulatory regions. This study reveals a previously uncharacterized role of DNA sequence variation in human circular RNA regulation.",
