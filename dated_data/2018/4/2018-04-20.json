    "abstract": "The analysis and interpretation of the RNA-Seq data can be time-consuming and challenging. We aim to streamline the bioinformatic analyses of gene-level data by developing a user-friendly web application for exploratory data analysis, differential expression, and pathway analysis. iDEP (integrated Differential Expression and Pathway analysis) seamlessly connects 63 R/Bioconductor packages, 208 annotation databases for plant and animal species, and 2 web services. The workflow can be reproduced by downloading customized R code and related files. As demonstrated by two examples, iDEP (http://ge-lab.org/idep/) democratizes access to bioinformatics resources and empowers biologists to easily gain actionable insights from transcriptomic data.",

    "abstract": "During mitosis, chromosomes fold into compacted rod shaped structures. We combined imaging and Hi-C of synchronous DT40 cell cultures with polymer simulations to determine how interphase chromosomes are converted into compressed arrays of loops characteristic of mitotic chromosomes. We found that the interphase organization is disassembled within minutes of prophase entry and by late prophase chromosomes are already folded as arrays of consecutive loops. During prometaphase, this array reorganizes to form a helical arrangement of nested loops. Polymer simulations reveal that Hi-C data are inconsistent with solenoidal coiling of the entire chromatid, but instead suggest a centrally located helically twisted axis from which consecutive loops emanate as in a spiral staircase. Chromosomes subsequently shorten through progressive helical winding, with the numbers of loops per turn increasing so that the size of a helical turn grows from around 3 Mb (~40 loops) to ~12 Mb (~150 loops) in fully condensed metaphase chromosomes. Condensin is essential to disassemble the interphase chromatin conformation. Analysis of mutants revealed differing roles for condensin I and II during these processes. Either condensin can mediate formation of loop arrays. However, condensin II was required for helical winding during prometaphase, whereas condensin I modulated the size and arrangement of loops inside the helical turns. These observations identify a mitotic chromosome morphogenesis pathway in which folding of linear loop arrays produces long thin chromosomes during prophase that then shorten by progressive growth of loops and helical winding during prometaphase.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryMitotic chromosome morphogenesis occurs through condensin-mediated disassembly of the interphase conformation and formation of extended prophase loop arrays that then shorten by loop growth and condensin-dependent helical winding.",

    "abstract": "The goal of Phylogenetic Comparative Methods (PCMs) is to study the distribution of quantitative traits among related species. The observed traits are often seen as the result of a Brownian Motion (BM) along the branches of a phylogenetic tree. Reticulation events such as hybridization, gene flow or horizontal gene transfer, can substantially affect a species traits, but are not modeled by a tree. Phylogenetic networks have been designed to represent reticulate evolution. As they become available for downstream analyses, new models of trait evolution are needed, applicable to networks. One natural extension of the BM is to use a weighted average model for the trait of a hybrid, at a reticulation point. We develop here an efficient recursive algorithm to compute the phylogenetic variance matrix of a trait on a network, in only one preorder traversal of the network. We then extend the standard PCM tools to this new framework, including phylogenetic regression with covariates (or phylogenetic ANOVA), ancestral trait reconstruction, and Pagels {lambda} test of phylogenetic signal. The trait of a hybrid is sometimes outside of the range of its two parents, for instance because of hybrid vigor or hybrid depression. These two phenomena are rather commonly observed in present-day hybrids. Transgressive evolution can be modeled as a shift in the trait value following a reticulation point. We develop a general framework to handle such shifts, and take advantage of the phylogenetic regression view of the problem to design statistical tests for ancestral transgressive evolution in the evolutionary history of a group of species. We study the power of these tests in several scenarios, and show that recent events have indeed the strongest impact on the trait distribution of present-day taxa. We apply those methods to a dataset of Xiphophorus fishes, to confirm and complete previous analysis in this group. All the methods developed here are available in the Julia package PhyloNetworks.",

    "abstract": "While anatomical pathways between forebrain cognitive and brainstem autonomic nervous centers are well defined, autonomic-central interactions during sleep and their contribution to waking performance are not understood. Here, we analyzed simultaneous central activity via electroencephalography (EEG) and autonomic heart beat-to-beat intervals (RR intervals) from electrocardiography (ECG) during wake and daytime sleep. We identified bursts of ECG activity that lasted 4-5 seconds and predominated in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREM). Using event-based analysis of NREM sleep, we found an increase in delta (0.5-4Hz) and sigma (12-15Hz) power and an elevated density of slow oscillations (0.5-1Hz) about 5 secs prior to peak of the heart rate burst, as well as a surge in vagal activity, assessed by high-frequency (HF) component of RR intervals. Using regression framework, we show that these Autonomic/Central Events (ACE) positively predicted post-nap improvement in a declarative memory task after controlling for the effects of spindles and slow oscillations from sleep periods without ACE. No such relation was found between memory performance and a control nap. Additionally, NREM ACE negatively correlated with REM sleep and learning in a non-declarative memory task. These results provide the first evidence that coordinated autonomic and central events play a significant role in declarative memory consolidation.",

Moreover, land managers and planners are often unable to gain timely access to maps they need to support their routine decision-making. This deficiency is partly due to a lack of suitable data on ecosystem change, driven mostly by the considerable technical expertise needed to make ecosystem maps from remote sensing data.\\nC_LIO_LIWe have developed a free and open-access online remote sensing and environmental modelling application, REMAP (the remote ecosystem monitoring and assessment pipeline; https://remap-app.org) that enables volunteers, managers, and scientists with little or no experience in remote sensing to develop high-resolution classified maps of land cover and land use change over time.\\nC_LIO_LIREMAP utilizes the geospatial data storage and analysis capacity of the Google Earth Engine, and requires only spatially resolved training data that define map classes of interest (e.g., ecosystem types). The training data, which can be uploaded or annotated interactively within REMAP, are used in a random forest classification of up to 13 publicly available predictor datasets to assign all pixels in a focal region to map classes. Predictor datasets available in REMAP represent topographic (e.g. slope, elevation), spectral (Landsat Archive image composites) and climatic variables (precipitation, temperature) that can inform on the distribution of ecosystems and land cover classes.\\nC_LIO_LIThe ability of REMAP to develop and export high-quality classified maps in a very short (<10 minute) time frame represents a considerable advance towards globally accessible and free application of remote sensing technology. By enabling access to data and simplifying remote sensing classifications, REMAP can catalyse the monitoring of land use and change to support environmental conservation, including developing inventories of biodiversity, identifying hotspots of ecosystem diversity, ecosystem-based spatial conservation planning, mapping ecosystem loss at local scales, and supporting environmental education initiatives.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Modern spatial navigation requires fluency with multiple representational formats, including visual scenes, signs, and words. These formats convey different information. Visual scenes are rich and specific, but contain extraneous details. Arrows, as an example of signs, are schematic representations in which the extraneous details are eliminated, but analog spatial properties are preserved. Words eliminate all spatial information and convey spatial directions in a purely abstract form. How does the human brain compute spatial directions within and across these formats? To investigate this question, we conducted two experiments on men and women: a behavioral study that was preregistered, and a neuroimaging study using multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data to uncover similarities and differences among representational formats. Participants in the behavioral study viewed spatial directions presented as images, schemas, or words (e.g., \\\"left\\\"), and responded to each trial, indicating whether the spatial direction was the same or different as the one viewed previously. They responded more quickly to schemas and words than images, despite the visual complexity of stimuli being matched. Participants in the fMRI study performed the same task, but responded only to occasional catch trials. Spatial directions in images were decodable in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) bilaterally, but were not in schemas and words. Spatial directions were also decodable between all three formats. These results suggest that IPS plays a role in calculating spatial directions in visual scenes, but this neural circuitry may be bypassed when the spatial directions are presented as schemas or words.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHuman navigators encounter spatial directions in various formats: words (\\\"turn left\\\"), schematic signs (an arrow showing a left turn), and visual scenes (a road turning left). The brain must transform these spatial directions into a plan for action. Here, we investigate similarities and differences between neural representations of these formats. We found that bilateral intraparietal sulci represents spatial directions in visual scenes and across the three formats. We also found that participants respond quickest to schemas, then words, then images, suggesting that spatial directions in abstract formats are easier to interpret than concrete formats. These results support a model of spatial direction interpretation in which spatial directions are either computed for real world action, or computed for efficient visual comparison.",

    "abstract": "In the history of life, some phenotypes have been acquired several times independently, through convergent evolution. Recently, lots of genome-scale studies have been devoted to identify nucleotides or amino acids that changed in a convergent manner when the convergent phenotypes evolved. These efforts have had mixed results, probably because of differences in the detection methods, and because of conceptual differences about the definition of a convergent substitution. Some methods contend that substitutions are convergent only if they occur on all branches where the phenotype changed towards the exact same state at a given nucleotide or amino acid position. Others are much looser in their requirements and define a convergent substitution as one that leads the site at which they occur to prefer a phylogeny in which species with the convergent phenotype group together. Here we suggest to look for convergent shifts in amino acid preferences instead of convergent substitutions to the exact same amino acid. We define as convergent shifts substitutions that occur on all branches where the phenotype changed and such that they correspond to a change in the type of amino acid preferred at this position. We implement the corresponding model into a method named PCOC. We show on simulations that PCOC better recovers convergent shifts than existing methods in terms of sensitivity and specificity. We test it on a plant protein alignment where convergent evolution has been studied in detail and find that our method recovers several previously identified convergent substitutions and proposes credible new candidates.",

    "abstract": "Streptomycetes are extensively used for the production of valuable products, including various antibiotics and industrial enzymes. The preferred way to grow these bacteria in industrial settings is in large-scale fermenters. Growth of streptomycetes under these conditions is characterized by the formation of complex mycelial particles, called pellets. While the process of pellet formation is well characterized, little is known about their disintegration. Here, we use a qualitative and quantitative approach to show that pellet fragmentation in Streptomyces lividans is initiated when cultures enter the stationary phase, which coincides with a remarkable change in pellet architecture. Unlike young pellets, aging pellets have a less dense appearance and are characterized by the appearance of filaments protruding from their outer edges. These morphological changes are accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of mycelial fragments in the culture broth. In the presence of fresh nutrients, these fragments are able to aggregate with other small fragments, but not with disintegrating pellets, to form new mycelial particles. Altogether, our work indicates that fragmentation might represent an escape mechanism from the environmental stress caused by nutrient scarcity, with striking similarities to the disassembly of bacterial biofilms.",

Ciliate mitochondrial genomes exhibit a unique combination of characteristics, including a linear organization and the presence of multiple genes with no known function or detectable homologs in other eukaryotes. Here we study the variation of ciliate mitochondrial genomes both within and across thirteen highly diverged Paramecium species, including multiple species from the P. aurelia species complex, with four outgroup species: P. caudatum, P. multimicronucleatum, and two strains that may represent novel related species. We observe extraordinary conservation of gene order and protein-coding content in Paramecium mitochondria across species. In contrast, significant differences are observed in tRNA content and copy number, which is highly conserved in species belonging to the P. aurelia complex but variable among and even within the other Paramecium species. There is an increase in GC content from ~20% to ~40% on the branch leading to the P. aurelia complex. Patterns of polymorphism in population-genomic data and mutation-accumulation experiments suggest that the increase in GC content is primarily due to changes in the mutation spectra in the P. aurelia species. Finally, we find no evidence of recombination in Paramecium mitochondria and find that the mitochondrial genome appears to experience either similar or stronger efficacy of purifying selection than the nucleus.",

    "abstract": "The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a leading animal model to study how signaling pathway components function in conserved biological processes. Here, we describe the role of an Axin family member, pry-1, in lipid metabolism. As a central component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, pry-1 acts as a scaffold to multiprotein destruction complex that negatively regulates the expression of Wnt target genes. A genome-wide transcriptome profiling of pry-1 mutant revealed genes associated with aging and lipid metabolism such as vitellogenins (yolk lipoproteins), fatty acid desaturases, lipases, and fatty acid transporters. Consistent with this we found that pry-1 is crucial for the normal adult lifespan and maintenance of lipid levels. Knock-downs of vit genes in pry-1 mutant background restored lipid levels, suggesting that Vitellogenins contribute to PRY-1 function in lipid metabolic processes. Additionally, lowered expression of desaturases and lipidomics analysis provided evidence that the fatty acid synthesis is reduced in pry-1 mutants. In agreement with this an exogenous supply of oleic acid restored depleted lipids in somatic tissues of worms. Overall, our findings demonstrate that PRY-1/Axin signaling is essential for lipid metabolism and involves regulation of yolk proteins.",

However, in mycobacteria, L,D-transpeptidase (LDT)-mediated crosslinks are highly abundant. To elucidate the role of these unusual crosslinks, we characterized mycobacterial cells lacking all LDTs. We find that LDT-mediated crosslinks are required for rod shape maintenance specifically at sites of aging cell wall, a byproduct of polar elongation. Asymmetric polar growth leads to a non-uniform distribution of these two types of crosslinks in a single cell. Consequently, in the absence of LDT-mediated crosslinks, PBP-catalyzed crosslinks become more important. Because of this, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is more rapidly killed using a combination of drugs capable of PBP- and LDT-inhibition. Thus, knowledge about the single-cell distribution of drug targets can be exploited to more effectively treat this pathogen.",

To more systematically ascertain and learn from cellular specializations in the brain, we used Drop-seq to perform single-cell RNA sequencing of 690,000 cells sampled from nine regions of the adult mouse brain: frontal and posterior cortex (156,000 and 99,000 cells, respectively), hippocampus (113,000), thalamus (89,000), cerebellum (26,000), and all of the basal ganglia - the striatum (77,000), globus pallidus externus/nucleus basalis (66,000), entopeduncular/subthalamic nuclei (19,000), and the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (44,000). We developed computational approaches to distinguish biological from technical signals in single-cell data, then identified 565 transcriptionally distinct groups of cells, which we annotate and present through interactive online software we developed for visualizing and re-analyzing these data (DropViz). Comparison of cell classes and types across regions revealed features of brain organization. These included a neuronal gene-expression module for synthesizing axonal and presynaptic components; widely shared patterns in the combinatorial co-deployment of voltage-gated ion channels by diverse neuronal populations; functional distinctions among cells of the brain vasculature; and specialization of glutamatergic neurons across cortical regions to a degree not observed in other neuronal or non-neuronal populations. We describe systematic neuronal classifications for two complex, understudied regions of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus externus and substantia nigra reticulata. In the striatum, where neuron types have been intensely researched, our data reveal a previously undescribed population of striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) comprising 4% of SPNs. The adult mouse brain cell atlas can serve as a reference for analyses of development, disease, and evolution.",

    "abstract": "For the first time, a complete genome of an RNA virus has been sequenced in its original form. Previously, RNA was sequenced by the chemical degradation of radiolabelled RNA, a difficult method that produced only short sequences. Instead, RNA has usually been sequenced indirectly by copying it into cDNA, which is often amplified to dsDNA by PCR and subsequently analyzed using a variety of DNA sequencing methods. We designed an adapter to short highly conserved termini of the influenza virus genome to target the (-) sense RNA into a protein nanopore on the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. Utilizing this method and total RNA extracted from the allantoic fluid of infected chicken eggs, we demonstrate successful sequencing of the complete influenza virus genome with 100% nucleotide coverage, 99% consensus identity, and 99% of reads mapped to influenza. By utilizing the same methodology we can redesign the adapter in order to expand the targets to include viral mRNA and (+) sense cRNA, which are essential to the viral life cycle. This has the potential to identify and quantify splice variants and base modifications, which are not practically measurable with current methods.",

    "abstract": "Generating a complete, de novo genome assembly for prokaryotes is often considered a solved problem. However, we here show that Pseudomonas koreensis P19E3 harbors multiple, near identical repeat pairs up to 70 kilobase pairs in length. Beyond long repeats, the P19E3 assembly was further complicated by a shufflon region. Its complex genome could not be de novo assembled with long reads produced by Pacific Biosciences technology, but required very long reads from the Oxford Nanopore Technology. Another important factor for a full genomic resolution was the choice of assembly algorithm.\\n\\nImportantly, a repeat analysis indicated that very complex bacterial genomes represent a general phenomenon beyond Pseudomonas. Roughly 10% of 9331 complete bacterial and a handful of 293 complete archaeal genomes represented this dark matter for de novo genome assembly of prokaryotes. Several of these dark matter genome assemblies contained repeats far beyond the resolution of the sequencing technology employed and likely contain errors, other genomes were closed employing labor-intense steps like cosmid libraries, primer walking or optical mapping. Using very long sequencing reads in combination with assemblers capable of resolving long, near identical repeats will bring most prokaryotic genomes within reach of fast and complete de novo genome assembly.",

NAc encodes outcome-related cue features such as the magnitude and identity of reward. However, little is known about how features of cues themselves are encoded. We designed a decision making task where rats learned multiple sets of outcome-predictive cues, and recorded single-unit activity in the NAc during performance. We found that coding of cue identity and location occurred alongside coding of expected outcome. Furthermore, this coding persisted both during a delay period, after the rat made a decision and was waiting for an outcome, and after the outcome was revealed. Encoding of cue features in the NAc may enable contextual modulation of ongoing behavior, and provide an eligibility trace of outcome-predictive stimuli for updating stimulus-outcome associations to inform future behavior.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCohesive visualization and interpretation of hyperdimensional, large-scale -omics data is an ongoing challenge, particularly for biologists and clinicians involved in current highly complex sequencing studies. Multivariate studies are often better suited towards non-linear network analysis than differential expression testing. Here, we present PRESTO, a  PREdictive Stochastic neighbor embedding Tool for Omics, which allows unsupervised dimensionality reduction of multivariate data matrices with thousands of subjects or conditions. PRESTO is intuitively integrated into an interactive user interface that helps to visualize the multidimensional patterns in genome-wide transcriptomic data from basic science and clinical studies.\\n\\nResultsPRESTO was tested with multiple input omics platforms, including microarray and proteomics from both mouse and human clinical datasets. PRESTO can analyze up to tens of thousands of genes and shows no increase in processing time with a large number of samples or patients. In complex datasets, such as those with multiple time points, several patient groups, or diverse mouse strains, PRESTO outperformed conventional methods. Core co-expressed gene networks were intuitively grouped in clusters, or gates, after dimensionality reduction and remained consistent across users. Networks were identified and assigned to physiological and pathological functions that cannot be gleaned from conventional bioinformatics analyses. PRESTO detected gene networks from the natural variations among mouse macrophages and human blood leukocytes. We applied PRESTO to clinical transcriptomic and proteomic data from large patient cohorts and detected disease-defining signatures in antibody-mediated kidney transplant rejection, renal cell carcinoma, and relapsing acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In AML, PRESTO confirmed a previously described gene signature and found a new signature of 10 genes that is highly predictive of patient outcome.\\n\\nConclusionsPRESTO offers an important integration of powerful bioinformatics tools with an interactive user interface that increases data analysis accessibility beyond bioinformaticians and  coders. Here, we show that PRESTO out performs conventional methods, such as DE analysis, in multi-dimensional datasets and can identify biologically relevant co-expression gene networks. In paired samples or time points, co-expression networks could be compared for insight into longitudinal regulatory mechanisms. Additionally, PRESTO identified disease-specific signatures in clinical datasets with highly significant diagnostic and prognostic potential.",

To address these challenges and maintain reproducibility of results, researchers need (i) a reliable way to run processing stages in any computational environment, (ii) a well-defined way to orchestrate those processing stages, and (iii) a data management layer that tracks data as it moves through the processing pipeline.\\n\\nResultsPachyderm is an open-source workflow system and data management framework that fulfills these needs by creating a data pipelining and data versioning layer on top of projects from the container ecosystem, having Kubernetes as the backbone for container orchestration. We adapted Pachyderm and demonstrated its attractive properties in bioinformatics. A Helm Chart was created so that researchers can use Pachyderm in multiple scenarios. The Pachyderm File System was extended to support block storage. A wrapper for initiating Pachyderm on cloud-agnostic virtual infrastructures was created. The benefits of Pachyderm are illustrated via a large metabolomics workflow, demonstrating that Pachyderm enables efficient and sustainable data science workflows while maintaining reproducibility and scalability.\\n\\nAvailabilityPachyderm is available from https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm.

    "abstract": "Sorting spikes from extracellular recording into clusters associated with distinct single units (putative neurons) is a fundamental step in analyzing neuronal populations. Such spike sorting is intrinsically unsupervised, as the number of neurons are not known a priori. Therefor, any spike sorting is an unsupervised learning problem that requires either of the two approaches: specification of a fixed value c for the number of clusters to seek, or generation of candidate partitions for several possible values of c, followed by selection of a best candidate based on various post-clustering validation criteria. In this paper, we investigate the first approach and evaluate the utility of several methods for providing lower dimensional visualization of the cluster structure and on subsequent spike clustering. We also introduce a visualization technique called improved visual assessment of cluster tendency (iVAT) to estimate possible cluster structures in data without the need for dimensionality reduction. Experimental results are conducted on two datasets with ground truth labels. In data with a relatively small number of clusters, iVAT is beneficial in estimating the number of clusters to inform the initialization of clustering algorithms. With larger numbers of clusters, iVAT gives a useful estimate of the coarse cluster structure but sometimes fails to indicate the presumptive number of clusters. We show that noise associated with recording extracellular neuronal potentials can disrupt computational clustering schemes, highlighting the benefit of probabilistic clustering models. Our results show that t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) provides representations of the data that yield more accurate visualization of potential cluster structure to inform the clustering stage. Moreover, The clusters obtained using t-SNE features were more reliable than the clusters obtained using the other methods, which indicates that t-SNE can potentially be used for both visualization and to extract features to be used by any clustering algorithm.",

Structure determination usually relies on physical techniques including x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy. Here we present a method that allows the high-resolution three-dimensional structure of a biological macromolecule to be determined only from measurements of the activity of mutant variants of the molecule. This genetic approach to structure determination relies on the quantification of genetic interactions (epistasis) between mutations and the discrimination of direct from indirect interactions. This provides a new experimental strategy for structure determination, with the potential to reveal functional and in vivo structural conformations at low cost and high throughput.",

    "abstract": "Eiger (Egr), the homolog of the mammalian tumor-necrosis factor (TNF), is the ligand of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) stress response signaling pathway in Drosophila. Although expression of Egr frequently leads to apoptosis, it has also been implicated in activation of non-apoptotic cell death. However, it is not yet clear how Egr can induce both apoptosis and non-apoptotic cell death, and if so, how such processes are coordinated. Here, we show that expression of Egr in the developing Drosophila eye induces apoptosis and non-apoptotic developmental defects, both of which are JNK-dependent. Intriguingly, when apoptotic effector caspases DrICE and Dcp-1 are defective or inhibited, expression of Egr induces necrosis characterized by loss of cell membrane integrity, translucent cytoplasm and aggregation of cellular organelles. Surprisingly, the induction of necrosis depends on the catalytic activity of the initiator caspase Dronc and the input from JNK signaling independently of their roles in apoptosis. Therefore, similar to the mammalian caspase-8, caspases in Drosophila also have dual roles in promoting TNF-mediated apoptosis and inhibiting necrosis.",

    "abstract": "A significant fraction of microRNA loci are organized in genomic clusters. The origin and evolutionary dynamics of these clusters have been extensively studied, although different authors have come to different conclusions. In a recent paper, it has been suggested that microRNAs in the same clusters evolve to target overlapping sets of genes. The authors interpret this as functional co- adaptation between clustered microRNAs. Here I reanalyze their results and I show that the observed overlap is mostly due to two factors: similarity between two seed sequences of a pair of clustered microRNAs, and the expected high number of common targets between pairs of microRNAs that have a large number of targets each. After correcting for these factors, I observed that clustered microRNAs from different microRNA families do not share more targets than expected by chance. During an exchange of correspondence and manuscripts, the authors of the original report acknowledged that the permutation methods they performed was not the method they described in their original paper. Here I show that the new permutation test proposed is biased and leads to systematic errors of the first kind, which will explain why the p-values reported were extremely (and unrealistically) low. I also discuss how to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of clustered microRNAs and their targets. In conclusion, there is no evidence of widespread functional co-adaptation between clustered microRNAs.",

However, their physiological functions in the mature nervous system are not fully understood. Here we use the C. elegans GABAergic motor neurons to study the post-developmental function of the APP-like protein APL-1 in vivo. We find that apl-1 has minimum roles in the maintenance of gross neuron morphology and function. However, we show that apl-1 is an inhibitor of axon regeneration, acting on mature neurons to limit regrowth in response to injury. The small GTPase Rab6/RAB-6.2 also inhibits regeneration, and does so in part by maintaining protein levels of APL-1. To inhibit regeneration, APL-1 functions via the E2 domain of its ectodomain; the cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane anchoring, and the E1 domain are not required for this function. Our data defines a novel role for APL-1 in modulating the neuronal response to injury.",

Global loss manifests itself in partially methylated domains (PMDs) which can extend up to megabases. However, the distribution of PMDs within and between tumor types, and their effects on key functional genomic elements including CGIs are poorly defined. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of breast cancers, we comprehensively show that loss of methylation in PMDs occurs in a large fraction of the genome and represents the prime source of variation in DNA methylation. PMDs are hypervariable in methylation level, size and distribution, and display elevated mutation rates. They impose intermediate DNA methylation levels incognizant of functional genomic elements including CGIs, underpinning a CGI methylator phenotype (CIMP). However, significant repression effects on cancer-genes are negligible as tumor suppressor genes are generally excluded from PMDs. The genomic distribution of PMDs reports tissue-of-origin of different cancers and may represent tissue-specific  silent regions of the genome, which tolerate instability at the epigenetic, transcriptomic and genetic level.",

Nonetheless, so far there is no evidence for the presence of piRNAs in the neurosensory retina.

The identified piRNAs were enriched with three motifs predicted to be involved in rRNA processing and sensory perception. Further, expression of piRNAs in donor eyes were assessed by qRT-PCR. Loss of piRNAs in HIWI2 knockdown ARPE19 cells downregulated targets implicated in intracellular transport (SNAREs and Rabs), circadian clock (TIMELESS) and retinal degeneration (LRPAP1 and RPGRIP1). Moreover, piRNAs were dysregulated under oxidative stress indicating their potential role in retinal pathology. Intriguingly, computational analysis revealed complete and partial seed sequence similarity between piR-62011 and sensory organ specific miR-183/96/182 cluster. Furthermore, the expression of retina enriched piR-62011 positively correlated with miR-182 in HIWI2 silenced Y79 cells.

Here, we examine theoretically the effect of progenitor compartments with varying differentiation and self-renewal capacities on the resulting observable distributions of replicative cellular ages. We find that strongly amplifying progenitor compartments, i.e. compartments with high self-renewal capacities, substantially broaden the age distributions which become skewed towards younger cells with a long tail of few old cells. However, since mutations predominantly accumulate during cell division, a few old cells may considerably increase cancer risk. In contrast, if tissues are organised into many downstream compartments with low self-renewal capacity, the shape of the replicative cell distributions in more differentiated compartments are dominated by stem cell dynamics with little added variation. In the limiting case of a strict binary differentiation tree without self-renewal, the shape of the output distribution becomes indistinguishable from the shape of the input distribution. Our results suggest that a comparison of cellular age distributions between healthy and cancerous tissues may inform about dynamical changes within the hierarchical tissue structure, i.e. an acquired increased self-renewal capacity in certain tumours.",

The aim of our study was to state whether monocrotaline pyrrole (MCTp), the main monocrotaline metabolite, could induce significant injury in mouse lung when given intravenously. MCTp caused moderate pulmonary inflammation, remodelling of small distal vessels (percentage of muscularized arteries: 33,5 vs 20,6%, p[&le;]0,0006) and a right ventricular dysfunction (RVSP 27,8mmHg vs 16,4mmHg, p[&le;]0,0001; Fulton index 0,35 vs 0,26, p[&le;]0,0007). These vascular effects were associated with a decrease in eNOS protein expression in lung tissues and resolved after 45 days.

    "abstract": "MotivationAlthough the characterization of within species genomic diversity continues to increase, this information is usually not incorporated in the sequencing analysis process. Existing reference genomes can easily be converted to graph-based reference genomes by extending them with known sequence variations. However, the practical use of these graph-based reference genomes depends on the ability to align reads to them. Performing substring queries to paths through these graphs lies at the core of this task. The combination of increasing pattern length and encoded variations inevitably leads to a combinatorial explosion of the search space. We present a solution that uses haplotype information to prevent this from happening.\\n\\nResultsWe present CHOP, a method that uses haplotype information to retrieve the constrained sequence search space of a graph-based reference genome. Our approach enables typical sequence aligners to perform read alignments to graphs that store any type of variation. CHOP performs similarly to another graph alignment method that unnecessarily indexes all combinations of sequence, while aligning reads to a population reference graph of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes. CHOP can achieve increased sensitivity for variation detection by iteratively integrating variation into a graph. Finally, we show that CHOP can be applied to large and complex datasets, by applying it on a graph-based representation of chromosome 6 of the human genome encoding the variants reported by the 1000 Genomes project.",

    "abstract": "Data of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and their analysis have been facilitating advances in our understanding of microbial ecosystems such as human gut microbiota. However, inference of microbial interactions occurring within an ecosystem is still a challenge mainly due to metagenomics sequencing (e.g., 16S rDNA sequences) providing relative abundance of microbes instead of absolute cell count. In order to describe the population dynamics in microbial communities and estimate the involved microbial interactions, we introduce a procedure by integrating generalized Lotka-Volterra equations, forward stepwise regression and bootstrap aggregation. First, we successfully identify experimentally confirmed microbial interactions with relative abundance data of a cheese microbial community. Then, we apply the procedure to time-series of 16S rDNA sequences of gut microbiomes of children who were progressing to Type 1 diabetes (T1D progressors), and compare their gut microbial interactions to a healthy control group. Our results suggest that the number of inferred microbial interactions increased over time during the first three years of life. More microbial interactions are found in the gut flora of healthy children than the T1D progressors. The inhibitory effects from Actinobacteria and Bacilli to Bacteroidia, from Bacteroidia to Clostridia, and the benifit effect from Clostridia to Bacteroidia are shared between healthy children and T1D progressors. An inhibition of Clostridia by Gammaproteobacteria is found in healthy children that maintains through their first three years of life. This suppression appears in T1D progressors during the first year of life, which transforms to a commensalism relationship at the age of three years old. Gammaproteobacteria is found exerting an inhibition on Bacteroidia in the T1D progressors, which is not identified in the healthy controls.",

    "abstract": "A plausible explanation for statistical epistasis revealed in genome wide association analyses is the presence of high order linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the genotyped markers tested for interactions and unobserved functional polymorphisms. Based on findings in experimental data, it has been suggested that high order LD might be a common explanation for statistical epistasis inferred between local polymorphisms in the same genomic region. Here, we empirically evaluate how prevalent high order LD is between local, as well as distal, polymorphisms in the genome. This could provide insights into whether we should account for this when interpreting results from genome wide scans for statistical epistasis. An extensive and strong genome wide high order LD was revealed between pairs of markers on the high density 250k SNP-chip and individual markers revealed by whole genome sequencing in the A. thaliana 1001-genomes collection. The high order LD was found to be more prevalent in smaller populations, but present also in samples including several hundred individuals. An empirical example illustrates that high order LD might be an even greater challenge in cases when the genetic architecture is more complex than the common assumption of bi-allelic loci. The example shows how significant statistical epistasis is detected for a pair of markers in high order LD with a complex multi allelic locus. Overall, our study illustrates the importance of considering also other explanations than functional genetic interactions when genome wide statistical epistasis is detected, in particular when the results are obtained in small populations of inbred individuals.",

Three recombinant pneumococcal surface proteins A (come from family1 and family 2) were expressed by prokaryotic expression system and were conjugated to group A meningococcal polysaccharide (GAMP) to make three polysaccharide-protein conjugates. The conjugates, un-conjugated proteins, GAMP and GAMP-TT vaccine bulk (used as positive control) were immunized to mice and their immune effects were evaluated by the method of ELISA, FCM and SBA. The results showed that the polysaccharide-protein conjugates can produce higher levels of anti-GAMP IgG titers (P < 0.05), higher ratios of Th1/Th2 (P < 0.05) and higher levels of serum bactericidal activity (P < 0.05) compared with the un-conjugated GAMP. The conjugation of PspAs to GAMP also enhanced the anti-PspA responses compared with un-conjugated PspAs except PspA3. In conclusion, all the results indicated that three PspAs were suitable carrier protein as demonstrated by the characteristics of a T-cell dependent response to the GAMP, and would protect against group A of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis and also have the potential to provide broad protection from Streptococcus pneumonia.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing view on murine hematopoiesis and on hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in particular derives from experiments that are related to regeneration after irradiation and HSC transplantation. However, over the past years, different experimental techniques have been developed to investigate hematopoiesis under homeostatic conditions, thereby providing access to proliferation and differentiation rates of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the unperturbed situation. Moreover, it has become clear that hematopoiesis undergoes distinct changes during aging with large effects on HSC abundance, lineage contribution, asymmetry of division and self-renewal potential. However, it is currently not fully resolved how stem and progenitor cells interact to respond to varying demands and how this balance is altered by an aging-induced shift in HSC polarity.\\n\\nHere, we present an in-silico model to investigate the dynamics of HSC response to varying demand. By introducing an internal feedback between stem and progenitor cells, the model is suited to consistently describe both hematopoietic homeostasis and regeneration, including the limited regulation of HSCs in the homeostatic situation. The model further explains the age-dependent increase in phenotypic HSCs as a consequence of the cells inability to preserve divisional asymmetry.\\n\\nOur model suggests a dynamically regulated population of intrinsically asymmetrically dividing HSCs as suitable control mechanism that adheres with many qualitative and quantitative findings on hematopoietic recovery after stress and aging. The modeling approach thereby illustrates how a mathematical formalism can support the conceptual and the quantitative understanding of regulatory principles in HSC biology.",

    "abstract": "Ran (Ras-related nuclear protein) plays several important roles in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, mitotic spindle formation, nuclear envelope/nuclear pore complex assembly, and other diverse functions in the cytoplasm, as well as in cellular transformation when activated. Unlike other Ras superfamily proteins, Ran contains an auto-inhibitory C-terminal tail, which packs against its G domain and bias Ran towards binding GDP over GTP. The biological importance of this C-terminal tail is not well understood. By disrupting the interaction between the C-terminus and the G domain, we were able to generate Ran mutants that are innately active and potently bind to RanBP1 (Ran Binding Protein 1), nuclear export factor CRM1 and nuclear import factor KPNB1. In contrast to previously reported activated Ran mutants, the C-terminus destabilized mutants are hydrolysis competent in cells, support nuclear transport, and do not form nuclear rim staining. Crystal structures show that one of these C-terminal mutations slightly changes its mode of binding to RanBP1. Finally, a high percentage of Ran C-terminus mutations from cancer patients were found to be destabilizing and hyperactivating, suggesting that Ran C-destabilization might be an unprecedented cellular transformation mechanism in affected cancers. This study also highlights a new drug design strategy towards treating patients with hyperactivated Ras proteins including K-Ras.",

    "abstract": "ONE SENTENCE SUMMARYA Tribbles 2 pseudokinase small molecule screen led to the identification of known EGFR/HER2 inhibitors that alter the stability of TRIB2 in vitro and lead to rapid on-target degradation of TRIB2 in human cancer cells.\\n\\nSHORT ABSTRACTTribbles 2 (TRIB2) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with a diverse interactome, including the AKT signaling module. Substantial evidence demonstrates that TRIB2 dysregulation is important in multiple human tumors. The non-canonical TRIB2 pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine rich region and interacts with a peptide motif in its own C-terminal tail. We demonstrate that TRIB2 is a target for previously described small molecule protein kinase  inhibitors, which were originally designed to inhibit the catalytic domain of EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinases. Using thermal-shift assays and drug repurposing, we classify ligands that stabilize or destabilize the TRIB2 pseudokinase domain. TRIB2 destabilizing agents, including the clinical inhibitor afatinib, lead to rapid and on-target TRIB2 protein degradation in tumor cells, eliciting tractable effects on cell signaling and survival. Our data identifies leads for further development of TRIB2-degrading drugs and highlights compound-induced TRIB2 downregulation, which might be mechanistically relevant for other catalytically-deficient (pseudo)kinases targeted by small molecules.\\n\\nFULL ABSTRACTA major challenge associated with biochemical and cellular analysis of pseudokinases is the lack of target-validated small molecule ligands with which to probe molecular function. Human Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with a diverse interactome, which includes the canonical AKT signaling module. There is substantial evidence that human TRIB2 is a therapeutic target in both solid tumors and blood cancers. The non-canonical TRIB2 pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine-rich region and interacts with a peptide motif in its own C-terminal tail, which was previously shown to drive interaction with cellular E3 ubiquitin ligases. In this study we demonstrate that TRIB2 is a target for previously described small molecule protein kinase inhibitors, which were originally designed to inhibit the canonical catalytic domain of the tyrosine kinases EGFR/HER2. Using a thermal-shift assay, we discovered TRIB2 ligands within the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS), and employed a drug repurposing approach to classify compounds that either stabilize or destabilize TRIB2 in vitro. Remarkably, TRIB2 destabilizing agents, including the clinical covalent drug afatinib, lead to rapid and on-target TRIB2 degradation in human cells, eliciting tractable effects on signaling and survival. Our data reveal the first drug-leads for development of TRIB2-degrading ligands, which will also be invaluable for unravelling the cellular mechanisms of TRIB2-based signaling. Our study highlights that small molecule-induced protein downregulation through drug  off-targets might be relevant for other inhibitors that serendipitously target pseudokinases.",

    "abstract": "TRF2 binds to telomeric repeats and is critical for telomere integrity. Evidence suggests that it also localizes to non-telomeric DNA damage sites. However, this recruitment appears to be precarious and functionally controversial. We find that TRF2 recruitment to damage sites occurs by a two-step mechanism: the initial rapid recruitment (phase I) and stable and prolonged association with damage sites (phase II). Phase I is poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent and requires the N-terminal basic domain. The phase II recruitment requires the C-terminal MYB/SANT domain and the iDDR region in the hinge domain, which is mediated by the MRE11 complex and is stimulated by hTERT. PARP-dependent recruitment of intrinsically disordered proteins contributes to transient displacement of TRF2 that separates two phases. TRF2 binds to the I-PpoI-induced DNA double-strand break sites, which is enhanced by the presence of complex damage and is dependent on PARP and the MRE11 complex. TRF2 depletion affects non-sister chromatid homologous recombination (HR) repair, but not HR between sister chromatids or non-homologous endjoining pathways. Our results demonstrate a unique recruitment mechanism and function of TRF2 at non-telomeric DNA damage sites.\\n\\nSummary StatementTRF2 is recruited to DNA double-strand break damage sites by a two-step mechanism and functions in non-sister chromatid homologous recombination repair",

While 13 core chromosomes are found in all strains, as many as eight accessory chromosomes show presence/absence variation and rearrangements among field isolates.

We report extremely high and variable rates of accessory chromosome loss during mitotic propagation in vitro and in planta. Spontaneous chromosome loss was observed in 2 to >50 % of cells during four weeks of incubation. Similar rates of chromosome loss in the closely related Z. ardabiliae suggest that this extreme chromosome dynamic is a conserved phenomenon in the genus. Elevating the incubation temperature greatly increases instability of accessory and even core chromosomes, causing severe rearrangements involving telomere fusion and chromosome breakage. Chromosome losses do not impact the fitness of Z. tritici in vitro, but some lead to increased virulence suggesting an adaptive role of this extraordinary chromosome instability.",

We further demonstrated that tissue-specificity correlates with specific families of canine transposable elements. In addition, we identified more than 900 conserved dog-human lncRNAs for which we show their overall reproducible expression patterns between dog and humans through comparative transcriptomics. Finally, co-expression analyses of lncRNA and neighbouring protein-coding genes identified more than 3,400 canine lncRNAs, suggesting that functional roles of these lncRNAs act as regulatory elements.

A replication analysis was conducted using 337,112 individuals from the UK Biobank (54% female, mean age =56.87, SD=8.00 years at recruitment).\\n\\nMain outcome measuresCoronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, BMI and subjective wellbeing.\\n\\nResultsThere was evidence of a causal effect of BMI on subjective wellbeing such that each 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI caused a 0.045 (95%CI 0.006 to 0.084, p=0.023) SD reduction in subjective wellbeing. Replication analyses provided strong evidence of an effect of BMI on satisfaction with health ({beta}=0.034 (95% CI: -0.042 to -0.026) unit decrease in health satisfaction per SD increase in BMI, p<2-16). There was no clear evidence of a causal effect between subjective wellbeing and the other physical health measures in either direction.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results suggest that a higher BMI lowers subjective wellbeing. Our replication analysis confirmed this finding, suggesting the effect in middle-age is driven by satisfaction with health. BMI is a modifiable determinant and therefore, our study provides further motivation to tackle the obesity epidemic because of the knock-on effects of higher BMI on subjective wellbeing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBody mass index (BMI) and alcohol consumption are suggested to independently and interactively increase the risk of liver disease. We assessed this combined effect using factorial Mendelian randomization (MR).\\n\\nMethodsWe used multivariable adjusted regression and MR to estimate individual and joint associations of BMI and alcohol consumption and liver disease biomarkers (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) y-glutamyltransferase (GGT)) and incident liver disease. We undertook a factorial MR study splitting participants by median of measured BMI or BMI allele score then by median of reported alcohol consumption or ADH1B genotype (AA/AG and GG), giving four groups; low BMI/low alcohol (-BMI/-alc), low BMI/high alcohol (-BMI/+alc), high BMI/low alcohol (+BMI/-alc) and high BMI/high alcohol (+BMI/+alc).\\n\\nResultsIndividual positive associations of BMI and alcohol with ALT, GGT and incident liver disease were found. In the factorial MR analyses, considering the +BMI/+alc group as the reference, mean circulating ALT and GGT levels were lowest in the -BMI/-alc group (2.32% (95% CI: -4.29, -0.35) and -3.56% (95% CI: -5.88; -1.24) for ALT and GGT respectively). Individuals with -BMI/+alc and +BMI/-alc had lower mean circulating ALT and GGT compared to the reference group (+BMI/+alc). For incident liver disease multivariable factorial analyses followed a similar pattern to those seen for the biomarkers, but little evidence of differences between MR factorial categories for odds of liver disease.\\n\\nConclusionsConsistent results from multivariable regression and MR analysis, provides compelling evidence for the individual adverse effects of BMI and alcohol consumption on liver disease. Intervening on both BMI and alcohol may improve the profiles of circulating liver biomarkers. However, this may not reduce clinical liver disease risk.",

    "abstract": "The relative evolutionary rates at individual sites in proteins are informative measures of conservation or adaptation. Often used as evolutionarily-aware conservation scores, relative rates reveal key functional or strongly-selected residues. Estimating rates in a phylogenetic context requires specifying a protein substitution model, which is typically a phenomenological model trained on a large empirical dataset. A strong emphasis has traditionally been placed on selecting the \\\"best-fit\\\" model, with the implicit understanding that suboptimal or otherwise ill-fitting models can potentially bias inferences. However, the pervasiveness and degree of such bias has not been systematically examined. We investigated how model choice impacts site-wise relative rates from a large set of empirical protein alignments. We compared models designed for use on any general protein, models designed for specific domains of life, and the simple equal-rates Jukes Cantor-style model (JC). As expected, information theoretic measures showed overwhelming evidence that some models fit the data decidedly better than others. By contrast, estimates of site-specific evolutionary rates were impressively insensitive to the substitution model used, revealing an unexpected degree of robustness to potential model misspecification. A deeper examination of the fewer than 5% of sites for which model inferences differed in a meaningful way showed that the JC model can uniquely identify rapidly-evolving sites that models with empirically-derived exchangeabilities fail to detect. We conclude that relative protein rates appear robust to the applied substitution model, and any sensible model of protein evolution, regardless of its fit to the data, should produce broadly consistent evolutionary rates.",

    "abstract": "Genetic association studies have detected two trans-acting quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 2, 6 and one cis-acting QTL on chromosome 11 that were associated with fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels. In these studies, HbF was expressed as a percentage of total hemoglobin or the number of erythrocytes that contain HbF (F-cells). As the{gamma} -globin chains of HbF are encoded by two non-allelic genes (HBG2, HBG1) that are expressed at different levels we used normalized gene expression and genotype data from The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)-project to study the effects of cis- and trans-acting HbF expression or eQTL. This allowed us to examine mRNA expression of HBG2 and HBG1individually. In addition to studying eQTL for globin genes we examined genes co-expressed with HBG1, studied upstream regulators of HBG1 co-expressed genes and performed a correlation analysis between HBG2 and HBG1 and known HbF regulators. Our results suggest differential effect of cis and trans-acting QTL on HBG and HBG1 expression. Trans-acting eQTLs have the same magnitude of effect on the expression of both HBG2 and HBG1 while the sole cis-acting eQTL affected only HBG2. Furthermore, the analysis of upstream regulators and the correlation analysis suggested that BCL2L1 might be a new potential trans-acting HbF activator. HbF is the major modulator of the phenotype of sickle cell anemia and {beta} thalassemia. Depending on the effect size, modification of trans-acting elements might have a greater impact on HbF levels than cis-acting elements alone.",

    "abstract": "DNA sequencing and analysis methods were compared for 16S rRNA V4 PCR amplicon and gDNA mock communities encompassing nine bacterial species commonly found in milk and dairy products. The communities were examined using Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent PGM DNA sequencing methods followed by the QIIME 1 (UCLUST) and Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm 2 (DADA2) data analysis pipelines including taxonomic comparisons to the Greengenes and Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) databases. Examination of the PCR amplicon mock community with these methods resulted in Operation Taxonomy Units (OTUs) and Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) that ranged from a low of 13 to high of 118 and were dependent on the DNA sequencing method and read assembly step. The elevated numbers of OTUs and ASVs included assignments to spurious taxa as well as sequence variants of the nine species included in the mock community. Comparisons between the gDNA and PCR amplicon mock communities showed that combining gDNA from the different strains prior to PCR resulted in up to 8.9-fold greater numbers of spurious OTUs and ASVs. However, the DNA sequencing method and initial data assembly steps conferred the largest effects on predictions of bacterial diversity, independent of the mock community type (PCR amplicon or gDNA; Bray-Curtis R2 = 0.88 and weighted Unifrac, R2 = 0.32). Overall, DNA sequencing performed with the Ion Torrent PGM and analyzed with DADA2 and the Greengenes database resulted in the most accurate predictions of the mock community phylogeny, taxonomy, and diversity.\\n\\nImportanceValidated methods are urgently needed to improve DNA-sequence based assessments of complex bacterial communities. In this study, we used 16S rRNA PCR amplicon and gDNA mock community standards, consisting of nine, dairy-associated bacterial species, to evaluate the most commonly applied 16S rRNA marker gene DNA sequencing and analysis platforms used in evaluating dairy and other bacterial habitats. Our results show that bacterial metataxonomic assessments are largely dependent on the DNA sequencing platform and read curation method used. DADA2 improved sequence annotation compared with QIIME 1, and when combined with the Ion Torrent PGM DNA sequencing platform and the Greengenes database for taxonomic assignment, the most accurate representation of the dairy mock community standards was reached. This approach will be useful for validating sample collection and DNA extraction methods and ultimately investigating bacterial population dynamics in milk and dairy-associated environments.",

    "abstract": "The eye muscles of humans with either inherited or sporadic forms of ALS are relatively unaffected during disease progression, a function of sparing of the cranial nerve motor neurons supplying them. Here we observe that cranial nerve nuclei are also spared in a mouse model of inherited SOD1-linked ALS. We examined the cranial nerve motor nuclei in a mouse strain, G85R SOD1YFP, which carries a high copy transgene encoding a mutant human SOD1-YFP fusion protein, that exhibits florid YFP-fluorescent aggregates in spinal cord motor neurons and paralyzes by 6 months of age. We observed in the cranial nerve nuclei that innervate the eye, 3N (oculomotor), 4N (trochlear), and 6N (abducens), that there was little (4N, 6N) or no (3N) aggregation, in comparison with other motor nuclei, 5N (trigeminal), 7N (facial), and 12N (hypoglossal), in the latter two of which florid aggregation was observed. Correspondingly, the number of ChAT positive motor neurons in 3N of G85R SOD1YFP relative to that in 3N of ChAT-EGFP mice showed that there was no loss of motor neurons over time, whereas in 12N there was progressive loss of motor neurons, amounting to a loss of [~]30% from G85R SOD1YFP by end-stage. Thus, the sparing of extraocular motor neurons as occurs in humans with ALS appears to be replicated in our SOD1-linked ALS mouse strain, supporting the validity of the mouse model for studying this aspect of selective motor system loss in ALS. Comparisons of extraocular motor neurons (e.g., from 3N), resistant to ALS pathology, with other cranial motor neurons (e.g., from 12N), sensitive to such pathology, may thus be of value in understanding mechanisms of protection vs. susceptibility of motor neurons.",

    "abstract": "Accurate identification of parasite species and strains is crucial to mitigate the risk of epidemics and emerging disease. Species of Neobenedenia are harmful monogenean ectoparasites that infect economically important bony fishes in aquaculture worldwide, however, the species boundaries between two of the most notorious taxa, N. melleni and N. girellae, has been a topic of contention for decades. Historically, identifications of Neobenedenia isolates have overwhelmingly been attributed to N. melleni, and it has been proposed that N. girellae is synonymous with N. melleni. We collected 33 Neobenedenia isolates from 22 host species spanning nine countries and amplified three genes including two nuclear (Histone 3 and 28S rDNA) and one mitochondrial (cytochrome b). Four major clades were identified using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses; clades A-D corresponding to N. girellae, N. melleni, N. longiprostata and N. pacifica respectively. All unidentified isolates and the majority of Neobenedenia sequences from GenBank fell into clade A. The results of this study indicate that N. girellae is a separate species to N. melleni, and that a large proportion of previous samples identified as N. melleni may be erroneous and a revision of identifications is needed.\\n\\nThe large diversity of host species that N. girellae is able to infect as determined in this study and the geographic range in which it is present (23.8426{degrees} S and 24.1426{degrees} N) makes it a globally cosmopolitan species and a threat to aquaculture industries around the world.",

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations in mononucleotide repeats are commonly used to assess the mismatch repair status of tumours. Current tests focus on repeats with a length above 15bp, which tend to be somatically more unstable than shorter ones. These longer repeats also have a substantially higher PCR error rate and tests that use capillary electrophoresis for fragment size analysis often require expert interpretation. In this communication, we present a panel of 17 short repeats (length 7-12bp) for sequence-based microsatellite instability (MSI) testing. Using a simple scoring procedure that incorporates the allelic distribution of the mutant repeats, and analysis of two cohort of tumours totalling 209 samples, we show that this panel is able to discriminate between MMR proficient and deficient tumours, even when constitutional DNA is not available. In the training cohort, the method achieved 100% concordance with fragment analysis, while in the testing cohort, 4 discordant samples were observed (corresponding to 97% concordance). Of these, 2 showed discrepancies between fragment analysis and immunohistochemistry and one was reclassified after re-testing using fragment analysis. These results indicate that our approach offers the option of a reliable, scalable routine test for MSI.",

This gap can be attributed to the difficulty in establishing general rules to encompass the immense diversity and complexity of biological systems. Even when a rule is established, it is often challenging to map it to mechanistic details and to quantify these details. We here address these challenges on a study of mutualism, an essential type of ecological interaction in nature. Using an appropriate level of abstraction, we deduced a general rule that predicts the outcomes of mutualistic systems, including coexistence and productivity. We further developed a standardized calibration procedure to apply the rule to mutualistic systems without the need to fully elucidate or characterize their mechanistic underpinnings. Our approach consistently provides explanatory and predictive power with various simulated and experimental mutualistic systems. Our strategy can pave the way for establishing and implementing other simple rules for biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Genome sequencing yields the sequence of many short snippets of DNA (reads) from a genome. Genome assembly attempts to reconstruct the original genome from which these reads were derived. This task is difficult due to gaps and errors in the sequencing data, repetitive sequence in the underlying genome, and heterozygosity, and assembly errors are common. These misassemblies may be identified by comparing the sequencing data to the assembly, and by looking for discrepancies between the two. Once identified, these misassemblies may be corrected, improving the quality of the assembly. Although tools exist to identify and correct misassemblies using Illumina pair-end and mate-pair sequencing, no such tool yet exists that makes use of the long distance information of the large molecules provided by linked reads, such as those offered by the 10x Genomics Chromium platform. We have developed the tool Tigmint for this purpose. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Tigmint, we corrected assemblies of a human genome using short reads assembled with ABySS 2.0 and other assemblers. Tigmint reduced the number of misassemblies identified by QUAST in the ABySS assembly by 216 (27%). While scaffolding with ARCS alone more than doubled the scaffold NGA50 of the assembly from 3 to 8 Mbp, the combination of Tigmint and ARCS improved the scaffold NGA50 of the assembly over five-fold to 16.4 Mbp. This notable improvement in contiguity highlights the utility of assembly correction in refining assemblies. We demonstrate its usefulness in correcting the assemblies of multiple tools, as well as in using Chromium reads to correct and scaffold assemblies of long single-molecule sequencing.

    "abstract": "Despite decades of focused research, the field has yet to develop a prophylactic vaccine. In the RV144 vaccine trial, non-neutralizing antibody responses were identified as a correlate for prevention of HIV acquisition. However, factors that predict the development of such antibodies are not fully elucidated. We sought to define the contribution of circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cell subsets to the development of non-neutralizing antibodies in HIV-1 clade C infection. Study participants were recruited from an acute HIV-1 clade C infection cohort. Plasma anti-gp41, -gp120, -p24 and -p17 antibodies were screened using a customized multivariate Luminex assay. Phenotypic and functional characterization of cTfh were performed using HLA class II tetramers and intracellular cytokine staining. In this study, we found that acute HIV-1 clade C infection skewed differentiation of functional cTfh subsets towards increased Tfh1 (p=0.02) and Tfh2 (p<0.0001) subsets, with a concomitant decrease in overall Tfh1-17 (that shares both Tfh1 and Tfh17 properties) (p=0.01) and Tfh17 subsets (p<0.0001) compared to HIV negative subjects. Interestingly, the frequencies of Tfh1 during acute infection (5.0-8.0 weeks post-infection) correlated negatively with set point viral load (p=0.03, r=-60) and were predictive of p24-specific plasma IgG titers at one year of infection (p=0.003, r=0.85). Taken together, our results suggest that circulating the Tfh1 subset plays an important role in the development of anti-HIV antibody responses and contributes to HIV suppression during acute HIV-1 infection. These results have implications for vaccine studies aimed at inducing long lasting anti-HIV antibody responses.\\n\\nImportanceThe HIV epidemic in southern Africa accounts for almost half of the global HIV burden with HIV-1 clade C being the predominant strain. It is therefore important to define immune correlates of clade C HIV control that might have implications for vaccine design in this region. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are critical for the development of HIV-specific antibody responses and could play a role in viral control. Here we showed that the early induction of circulating Tfh1 cells during acute infection correlated positively with the magnitude of p24-specific IgG and was associated with lower set point viral load. This study highlights a key Tfh cell subset that could limit HIV replication by enhancing antibody generation. This study underscores the importance of circulating Tfh cells in promoting non-neutralizing antibodies during HIV-1 infection.",

    "abstract": "When human cells enter mitosis, chromosomes undergo substantial changes in their organisation to resolve sister chromatids and compact chromosomes. Despite the fundamental importance of this phenomenon to genome stability, we still do not fully comprehend the timing and coordination of these events. To address these questions, we need to evaluate the progression of both sister chromatid resolution and chromosome compaction in one assay. We achieved this by analysing changes in configuration of marked chromosome regions over time, with high spatial and temporal resolution. This assay showed that sister chromatid resolution is an iterative process that begins in late G2 phase and completes in prophase. Cohesins and WAPL antagonistically regulate sister chromatid resolution in late G2 and prophase whilst local enrichment of cohesin on chromosomes prevents precocious sister chromatid resolution. Moreover, our assay allowed quantitative evaluation of the timing and efficiency of condensin II and I activities in promoting sister chromatid resolution and chromosome compaction, respectively. Thus, our real-time assay sheds new light on the dynamics of mitotic chromosome resolution and compaction.",

    "abstract": "To ensure a faithful segregation of chromosomes, DNA must be fully replicated before mitotic entry. However, how cells sense the completion of DNA replication and to what extent this is linked to the activation of the mitotic machinery remains poorly understood. We previously showed that USP7 is a replisome-associated deubiquitinase with an essential role in DNA replication. Here, we reveal that USP7 inhibition leads to the ubiquitination of MCM7, a hallmark of DNA replication termination. In addition, USP7 inhibition leads to the ubiquitination of additional replisome components such as POLD1, which are displaced from replisomes. Surprisingly, this premature termination of DNA replication occurs concomitant to a generalized activation of CDK1 throughout the entire cell cycle, which impairs chromosome segregation and is toxic for mammalian cells. Accordingly, the toxicity of USP7 inhibitors is alleviated by CDK1 inhibition. Our work sheds light into the mechanism of action of USP7 inhibitors and provides evidence to the concept that DNA replication termination is coupled to the activation of the mitotic program.",

We report the results of an extensive study evaluating the most popular protein alignment methods as well as the statistical co-estimation method BAli-Phy on 1192 protein data sets from established benchmarks as well as on 120 simulated data sets. Our study (which used more than 230 CPU years for the BAli-Phy analyses alone) shows that BAli-Phy is dramatically more accurate than the other alignment methods on the simulated data sets, but is among the least accurate on the biological benchmarks. There are several potential causes for this discordance, including model misspecification, errors in the reference alignments, and conflicts between structural alignment and evolutionary alignments; future research is needed to understand the most likely explanation for our observations. multiple sequence alignment, BAli-Phy, protein sequences, structural alignment, homology",

    "abstract": "An essential property of microbial communities is the ability to survive a disturbance. Survival can be achieved through resistance, the ability to absorb effects of a disturbance without a significant change, or resilience, the ability to recover after being perturbed by a disturbance. These concepts have long been applied to the analysis of ecological systems, though their interpretations are often subject to debate. Here we show that this framework readily lends itself to the dissection of the bacterial response to antibiotic treatment, where both terms can be unambiguously defined. The ability to tolerate the antibiotic treatment in the short term corresponds to resistance, which primarily depends on traits associated with individual cells. In contrast, the ability to recover after being perturbed by an antibiotic corresponds to resilience, which primarily depends on traits associated with the population. This framework effectively reveals the phenotypic signatures of bacterial pathogens expressing extended spectrum {beta}-lactamases (ESBLs), when treated by a {beta}-lactam antibiotic. Our analysis has implications for optimizing treatment of these pathogens using a combination of a {beta}-lactam and a {beta}-lactamase (Bla) inhibitor. In particular, our results underscore the need to dynamically optimize combination treatments based on the quantitative features of the bacterial response to the antibiotic or the Bla inhibitor.",

    "abstract": "In most mammals, including mice and humans, meiotic recombination is determined by the meiosis specific histone methytransferase PRDM9, which binds to specific DNA sequences and trimethylates histone 3 at lysine-4 and lysine-36 at the adjacent nucleosomes. These actions ensure successful DNA double strand break initiation and repair that occur on the proteinaceous structure forming the chromosome axis. The process of hotspot association with the axis after their activation by PRDM9 is poorly understood. Previously, we and others have identified CXXC1, an ortholog of S. cerevisiae Spp1 in mammals, as a PRDM9 interactor. In yeast, Spp1 is a histone methyl reader that links H3K4me3 sites with the recombination machinery, promoting DSB formation. Here we investigated whether CXXC1 has a similar function in mouse meiosis. We found that CXXC1 is co-expressed and interacts with PRDM9 in mouse spermatocytes. To investigate the meiotic function of CXXC1, we created a Cxxc1 conditional knockout mouse to deplete CXXC1 before the onset of meiosis. Surprisingly, knockout mice were fertile, and the loss of CXXC1 in spermatocytes had no effect on hotspot trimethylation activity, double-strand break formation or repair. Our results demonstrate that CXXC1 is not an essential link between recombination hotspot sites and DSB machinery and that the hotspot recognition pathway in mouse is independent of CXXC1.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMeiotic recombination increases genetic diversity by ensuring novel combination of alleles passing onto the next generation correctly. In most mammals, the meiotic recombination sites are determined by histone methyltransferase PRDM9. These sites subsequently become associated with the chromosome axis with the participation of additional proteins and undergo double strand breaks, which are repaired by homologous recombination. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Spp1 (ortholog of CXXC1) binds to methylated H3K4 and connects these sites with chromosome axis promoting DSB formation. However, our data suggest that even though CXXC1 interacts with PRDM9 in male germ cells, it does not play a crucial role in mouse meiotic recombination. These results indicate that, unlike in S. cerevisiae, a recombination initiation pathway that includes CXXC1 could only serve as a non-essential pathway in mouse meiotic recombination.",

    "abstract": "Mammals lack robust regenerative abilities. Lost cells in impaired tissue could potentially be compensated by converting nearby cells in situ through in vivo reprogramming. Small molecule-induced reprogramming is a spatiotemporally flexible and non-integrative strategy for altering cell fate, which is, in principle, favorable for the in vivo reprogramming in organs with poor regenerative abilities, such as the brain. Here, we demonstrate that in the adult mouse brain, small molecules can reprogram resident astrocytes into functional neurons. The in situ chemically induced neurons (CiNs) resemble endogenous neurons in terms of neuron-specific marker expression and electrophysiological properties. Importantly, these CiNs can integrate into the mouse brain.

    "abstract": "Morphogen gradients provide concentration-dependent positional information along polarity axes. Although the dynamics of establishment of these gradients is well described, precision and noise in the downstream activation processes remain elusive. A simple paradigm to address these questions is the Bicoid morphogen gradient that elicits a rapid step-like transcriptional response in young fruit fly embryos. Focusing on the expression of the main Bicoid target, hunchback (hb), at the onset of zygotic transcription, we used the MS2-MCP approach which combines fluorescent labeling of nascent mRNA with live imaging at high spatial and temporal resolution. Removing 36 putative Zelda binding sites unexpectedly present in the original MS2 reporter, we show that the 750 bp of the hb promoter are sufficient to recapitulate endogenous expression at the onset of zygotic transcription. After each mitosis, in the anterior, expression is turned on to rapidly reach a plateau with all nuclei expressing the reporter. Consistent with a Bicoid dose-dependent activation process, the time period required to reach the plateau increases with the distance to the anterior pole. Remarkably, despite the challenge imposed by frequent mitoses and high nuclei-to-nuclei variability in transcription kinetics, it only takes 3 minutes at each interphase for the MS2 reporter loci to measure subtle differences in Bicoid concentration and establish a steadily positioned and steep (Hill coefficient ~ 7) expression boundary. Modeling based on cooperativity between the 6 known Bicoid binding sites in the hb promoter region and assuming rate limiting concentrations of the Bicoid transcription factor at the boundary is able to capture the observed dynamics of pattern establishment but not the steepness of the boundary. This suggests that additional mechanisms are involved in the steepness of the response.",

    "abstract": "Identifying what an object is, and whether an object has been encountered before, is a crucial aspect of human behavior. Despite this importance, we do not have a complete understanding of the neural basis of these abilities. Investigations into the neural organization of human object representations have revealed category specific organization in the ventral visual stream in perceptual tasks. Interestingly, these categories fall within broader domains of organization, with distinctions between animate, inanimate large, and inanimate small objects. While there is some evidence for category specific effects in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), it is currently unclear whether domain level organization is also present across these structures. To this end, we used fMRI with a continuous recognition memory task. Stimuli were images of objects from several different categories, which were either animate or inanimate, or large or small within the inanimate domain. We employed representational similarity analysis (RSA) to test the hypothesis that object-evoked responses in MTL structures during recognition-memory judgments also show evidence for domain-level organization along both dimensions. Our data support this hypothesis. Specifically, object representations were shaped by either animacy, real-world size, or both, in perirhinal and parahippocampal cortex, as well as the hippocampus. While sensitivity to these dimensions differed when structures when probed individually, hinting at interesting links to functional differentiation, similarities in organization across MTL structures were more prominent overall. These results argue for continuity in the organization of object representations in the ventral visual stream and the MTL.",

    "abstract": "Systematic reviews aim to maximise transparency and comprehensiveness, whilst also minimising subjectivity and sources of bias. Because of these time-consuming and complex tasks, systematic reviews are perceived as being resource-intensive. To date, published estimates of systematic review resource requirements have been largely anecdotal, being imprecise and not based on evidence. However, it is valuable to provide reliable means of estimating the resource and time requirements of systematic reviews and maps. We analysed all CEE systematic reviews (n=66) and maps (n=20) published or registered between 2012 and 2017 to estimate the average time needed to complete a systematic review and map. We then surveyed 33 experienced systematic reviewers to collate information on time needed for each stage of the review process. Our results show that the average CEE systematic review takes 157 days (SD; {+/-}22), whilst the average CEE systematic map takes 209 days (SD; {+/-}53). While screening of titles and abstracts is widely accepted to be time-consuming, in practice meta-data extraction and critical appraisal can take as long (or even longer) to complete, especially when producing systematic maps. Finally, we present a tool that allows the user to predict the time requirements of a review or map given information known about the planned methods and evidence base likely to be identified. Our tool uses evidence-based defaults as a useful starting point for those wishing to predict the time requirements for a particular review. Our analyses shed light on the most time-consuming stages of the systematic review and map process, and highlight key bottlenecks from the perspective of time requirements, helping future reviewers to plan their time accordingly. Future predictions of effort required to complete systematic reviews and maps could be improved if CEE and CEE review authors provided more detailed reporting of the methods and results of their reviewing processes.",

    "abstract": "It has long been posited that threat learning operates and forms under an affective and a cognitive learning system that are supported by different brain circuits. A primary drawback in exposure-based therapies is the high rate of relapse when higher order inhibitory structures failed to inhibit the emotional responses driven by the defensive circuit. It has been shown that implicit exposure of fearful stimuli leads to a long-lasting reduction of avoidance behavior in patients with phobia through the facilitation of fear processing areas in the absence of subjective fear. Despite the potential benefits of this approach in the treatment of phobias and PTSD, implicit exposure to fearful stimuli is still under-investigated. Here, we used unconscious presentation of threat-conditioned stimuli in healthy humans, using a continuous flash suppression technique. We found that implicit exposure of a conditioned stimulus reduced, on the following day, defensive responses to the conditioned stimulus measured by threat-potentiated startle responses but not by the electrodermal activity. Our results suggest that implicit exposure using CFS might facilitate the modulation of the affective component of fearful memories, representing an important therapeutic target to further advance exposure-based psychotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), an imprinted neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by metabolic, sleep, and neuropsychiatric features, is caused by the loss of paternal SNORD116, containing only noncoding RNAs. The primary SNORD116 transcript is processed into small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), which localize to nucleoli, and their spliced host gene 116HG, which is retained at its site of transcription. While functional complementation of the SNORD116 noncoding RNAs is a desirable goal for treating PWS, the mechanistic requirements of SNORD116 RNA processing are poorly understood. Here we developed and tested a novel transgenic mouse which ubiquitously expresses Snord116 on both a wild-type and Snord116 paternal deletion (Snord116+/-) background. Interestingly, while the Snord116 transgene was ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues, splicing of the transgene and production of snoRNAs was limited to brain tissues. Knockdown of Rbfox3, encoding neuron-specific splicing factor NeuN, in Snord116+/--derived neurons reduced splicing of the transgene in neurons. RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization for 116HG revealed a single significantly larger signal in transgenic mice, demonstrating colocalization of transgenic and endogenous 116HG RNAs. Similarly, significantly increased snoRNA levels were detected in transgenic neuronal nucleoli, indicating that transgenic Snord116 snoRNAs were effectively processed and localized. In contrast, neither transgenic 116HG nor snoRNAs were detectable in either non-neuronal tissues or Snord116+/- neurons. Together, these results demonstrate that exogenous expression and neuron-specific splicing of the Snord116 locus are insufficient to rescue the genetic deficiency of Snord116 paternal deletion. Elucidating the mechanisms regulating Snord116 processing and localization are essential to develop effective gene replacement therapies for PWS.",

The electrophysiological P300 is associated with rapid allocation of attention, and bridges stimulus and response processing. P300 is among the most studied and robust electrophysiological components, but how different subcomponents of the P300 develop from childhood to adulthood and relate to structural properties of the cerebral cortex is not well understood. We investigated age-related differences in both early visual and P300 components, and how individual differences in these components related to cortical structure in a cross-sectional sample of participants 8-19 years (n=86). Participants completed a three-stimulus visual oddball task while high-density EEG was recorded. Cortical surface area and thickness were estimated from T1-weighthed MRI. Group-level blind source separation of the EEG data identified two P300-like components, a fronto-central P300 and a parietal P300, as well as a component reflecting N1 and P2. Differences in activity across age were found for the parietal P300, N1 and P2, with the parietal P300 showing stronger activity for older participants, while N1 and P2 were stronger for younger participants. Stronger P300 components were positively associated with task performance, independently of age, while negative associations were found for P2 strength. Parietal P300 strength was age-independently associated with larger surface area in a region in left lateral inferior temporal cortex. We suggest that the age differences in component strength reflect development of attentional mechanisms, with increased brain responses to task-relevant stimuli representing an increasing ability to focus on relevant information and to respond accurately and efficiently.",

    "abstract": "RNA binding proteins are a diverse class of proteins that regulate all aspects of RNA metabolism. Accumulating studies indicate that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins are associated with cellular adaptations in response to drugs of abuse. We recently mapped and validated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (Hnrnph1) as a quantitative trait gene underlying differential behavioral sensitivity to methamphetamine. The molecular mechanisms by which hnRNP H1 alters methamphetamine behaviors are unknown but could involve preand/or post-synaptic changes in protein localization and function. Methamphetamine initiates post-synaptic D1 dopamine receptor signaling indirectly by binding to pre-synaptic dopamine transporters and vesicular monoamine transporters of midbrain dopaminergic neurons which triggers revers e transport and accumulation of dopamine at the synapse. Here, we examined changes in neuronal localization of hnRNP H in primary rat cortical neurons that express dopamine receptors that can be modulated by the D1 or D2 dopamine receptor agonists SKF38393 and (-)-Quinpirole HCl, respectively. Basal immunostaining of hnRNP H was localized primarily to the nucleus. D1 dopamine receptor activation induced an increase in hnRNP H nuclear immunostaining as detected by immunocytochemistry with a C-domain directed antibody containing epitope near the glycine-rich domain but not with an N-domain specific antibody. Although there was no change in hnRNP H protein in the nucleus or cytoplasm, there was a decrease in Hnrnph1 transcript following D1 receptor stimulation. Taken together, these results suggest that D1 receptor activation increases availability of the hnRNP H C-terminal epitope, which could potentially reflect changes in protein-protein interactions. Thus, D1 receptor signaling could represent a key molecular post-synaptic event linking Hnrnph1 polymorphisms to drug-induced behavior.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe investigated immunofluorescence and localization of hnRNP H following dopamine receptor activation in primary rat cortical neurons.\\nC_LIO_LIActivation of D1 dopamine receptor increased nuclear immunofluorescence of the C-terminal domain but not the N-terminal domain of hnRNP H with no change in either nuclear or cytoplasmic levels of hnRNP H protein.\\nC_LIO_LID1 dopamine signaling could alter interaction of hnRNP H with other proteins.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Economic choice and stopping are not traditionally treated as related phenomena. However, we were motivated by foraging models of economic choice to hypothesize that they may reflect similar neural processes occurring in overlapping brain circuits. We recorded neuronal activity in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), while macaques performed a stop signal task interleaved with a structurally matched economic choice task. Decoding analyses show that OFC ensembles predict successful versus failed stopping both before the trial and immediately after the stop signal, even after controlling for value predictions. These responses indicate that OFC contributes both proactively and reactively to stopping. Moreover, OFC neurons engagement in one task positively predicted their engagement in the other. Finally, firing patterns that distinguished low from high value offers in the economic task distinguished failed and successful trials in the stopping task. These results endorse the idea that economic choice and inhibition may be subject to theoretical unification.",

    "abstract": "Hand preference is a conspicuous variation in human behaviour, with a worldwide proportion of around 90% of people preferring to use the right hand for many tasks, and 10% the left hand. We used the large, general population cohort of the UK biobank (~500,000 participants) to study possible relations between early life factors and adult hand preference. The probability of being left-handed was affected by the year and location of birth, likely due to cultural effects. In addition, handedness was affected by birthweight, being part of a multiple birth, season of birth, breastfeeding, and sex, with each effect remaining significant after accounting for all others. Maternal smoking showed no association with handedness. Analysis of genome-wide genotype data showed that left-handedness was very weakly heritable, but shared no genetic basis with birthweight. Although on average left-handers and right-handers differed for a number of early life factors, all together these factors had only a minimal predictive value for individual hand preference. Therefore other, unknown effects must be involved, including possible environmental factors, and/or random developmental variation with respect to the left-right formation of the embryonic brain.\\n\\nSignificance statementLeft-right laterality is an important aspect of human brain organization which is set up early in development. Left-handedness is an overt and relatively prevalent form of atypical brain laterality. Various, often related, early life factors have been previously studied in relation to handedness, but often in small samples, or samples with biased selection schemes. Here we have performed the largest ever study of left-handedness in relation to early life factors. Left-handedness was very weakly heritable and there were significant effects of various factors such as birthweight, which remained significant after controlling for all others. However, considered all together, early life factors still had poor predictive power for the handedness of any given individual. Very early developmental perturbations, caused by environmental or chance effects in embryonic development, are therefore likely to cause left-handedness.",

Despite their importance for understanding global ecological and evolutionary processes, plant-animal interaction gradients are particularly difficult to test systematically across large geographic gradients, and evidence from smaller, disparate studies is inconclusive. By systematically measuring post-dispersal seed predation using 6980 standardized seed depots along 18 mountains in the Pacific cordillera, we found that seed predation increases 18% from the Arctic to Equator and 16% from 4000 masl to sea level. Clines in total predation, likely driven by invertebrates, were consistent across tree-line ecotones and in continuous forest, and were better explained by climate seasonality than by productivity, biodiversity, or latitude. These results suggest that species interactions play predictably greater ecological and evolutionary roles in tropical, lowland, and other less seasonal ecosystems.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryPost-dispersal seed predation increases from the Arctic to the Equator and from high elevations to sea level.",

    "abstract": "Cryptosporidiosis is a leading cause of diarrhea in infants and immune-compromised individuals. The lack of effective drugs against this enteric infection is motivating research to develop alternative treatments. To this aim, the impact of probiotics on the course of cryptosporidiosis was explored. The native intestinal microbiota of specific pathogen-free immunosuppressed mice was initially depleted with orally administered antibiotics. Then, a commercially available probiotic product intended for human consumption was added (or not) to the drinking water. Probiotic treated and untreated mice were orally infected with Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. On average, mice treated with probiotic excreted more oocysts, indicative of a more severe infection. The probiotic treatment significantly altered the fecal microbiota, but taxonomic analyses showed no direct association between ingestion of probiotic bacteria and their abundance in fecal microbiota. These results suggest that probiotics indirectly alter the intestinal microenvironment in such a way that favors proliferation of C. parvum. The increase in the relative abundance of facultative anaerobes observed in mice with severe cryptosporidiosis indicates that dysbiosis is a consequence of severe cryptosporidiosis. The increase in the abundance of facultative anaerobes observed in severely infected animals is consistent with analyses of microbiota from individuals infected with other enteric pathogens. The results are significant because they show that C. parvum responds to changes in the intestinal microenvironment induced by a nutritional supplement.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryMice treated with probiotics develop more severe symptoms of cryptosporidiosis.",

Therefore, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) plays an important diagnostic role. Here we designed the primer set FM8/9 to amplify 644 bases of the conserved 3D region of all seven serotypes of FMD virus (FMDV). We compared the performance of RT-PCR assays using FM8/9 with that using the primer set 1F/R targeting the 5-UTR described in the manual of the World Organization for Animal Health. The detection limits of the RT-PCR assays were determined for 14 strains representing all serotypes. Compared with the sensitivities of the RT-PCR assay using 1F/R, those using FM8/9 were 101-to 104-fold higher for eight strains. To assess the validity of the methods for analyzing clinical samples, sera and saliva samples from pigs and cows infected with FMDV were collected daily and analyzed using the two PCR assays. The FM8/9 assay detected FMDV from all infected pigs and cows for longer times compared with the 1F/R assay, therefore revealing higher sensitivity for the clinical samples. Our results suggest that the FM8/9 RT-PCR assay is highly sensitive and is therefore suitable for the diagnosis of FMD.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging studies have implicated a set of striatal and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) regions that are commonly activated during reward processing tasks. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) studies have demonstrated that the human brain is organized into several functional systems that show strong temporal coherence even in the absence of goal-directed tasks. Here we use seed-based and graph-theory RSFC approaches to characterize the systems-level organization of putative reward regions of at rest. Peaks of connectivity from seed-based RSFC patterns for the nucleus accumbens (NAcc, anatomically defined) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, functionally defined) were used to identify candidate reward regions which were merged with a previously used set of regions (Power et al., 2011). Graph-theory was then used to determine system-level membership for all regions. Several regions previously implicated in reward-processing (NAcc, lateral and medial OFC, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex) comprised a distinct, preferentially coupled system. This RSFC system is stable across a range of connectivity thresholds and shares strong overlap with meta-analyses of task-based reward studies. This reward system shares between-system connectivity with systems implicated in cognitive control and self-regulation, including the fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular, and default systems. Further, differences may exist in the pathways through which control systems interact with key regions of this reward system. Whereas NAcc regions of the reward system are functionally connected to cingulo-opercular and default systems, OFC regions of the reward system show stronger connectivity with the fronto-parietal system. We propose that future work may be able to interrogate group or individual differences in connectivity profiles using the regions delineated in the current work to explore potential relationships to appetitive behaviors, self-regulation failure, and addiction.",

    "abstract": "The dentate gyrus is essential for remembering the fine details of experiences that comprise episodic memory. Dentate gyrus granule cells receive highly-processed sensory information and are hypothesized to perform a pattern separation function, whereby similar sensory inputs are transformed into orthogonal neural representations. Behaviorally, this is believed to enable distinct memory for highly interfering stimuli. Since the dentate gyrus is comprised of a large number of adult-born neurons, which have unique synaptic wiring and neurophysiological firing patterns, it has been proposed that neurogenesis may contribute to this process in unique ways. Some behavioral evidence exists to support this role, whereby neurogenesis-deficient rodents are impaired at discriminating the fine visuospatial details of experiences. However, the extent to which newborn neurons contribute to dentate gyrus-dependent learning tasks is unclear. Furthermore, since most studies of dentate gyrus function are conducted in male rats, little is known about how females perform in similar situations, and whether there might be sex differences in the function of adult neurogenesis. To address these issues, we examined spatial discrimination memory in transgenic male and female rats that lacked adult neurogenesis. The first task probed memory for the position of local objects in an open field, assessed by behavioral responses to novel object locations. The second task examined memory for distal environmental cues. All rats were able to successfully discriminate local and distal cue changes. Males and females also performed comparably, although females displayed higher levels of rearing and locomotion. Collectively, our results indicate that rats are capable of learning about local and distal cues in the absence of adult neurogenesis.",

    "abstract": "We consider the inference problem of reconstructing a visual stimulus from brain activity measurements (e.g. fMRI) that encode this stimulus. Recovering a complete image is complicated by the fact that neural representations are noisy, high-dimensional, and contain incomplete information about image details. Thus, reconstructions of complex images from brain activity require a strong prior. Here we propose to train generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn a generative model of images that is conditioned on measurements of brain activity. We consider two challenges of this approach: First, given that GANs require far more data to train than is typically collected in an fMRI experiment, how do we obtain enough samples to train a GAN that is conditioned on brain activity? Secondly, how do we ensure that our generated samples are robust against noise present in fMRI data? Our strategy to surmount both of these problems centers around the creation of surrogate brain activity samples that are generated by an encoding model. We find that the generative model thus trained generalizes to real fRMI data measured during perception of images and is able to reconstruct the basic outline of the stimuli.",

We report that in co-immunoprecipitation assays PARP2 interacts with several isoforms of the importin- group of nuclear transport adapters and that PARP2 binding to IMPORTIN-2 is mediated by the identified nuclear localization sequence.

    "abstract": "Plant specialized metabolism (SM) enzymes produce lineage-specific metabolites with important ecological, evolutionary, and biotechnological implications. Using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model, we identified distinguishing characteristics of SM and GM (general metabolism, traditionally referred to as primary metabolism) genes through a detailed study of features including duplication pattern, sequence conservation, transcription, protein domain content, and gene network properties. Analysis of multiple sets of benchmark genes revealed that SM genes tend to be tandemly duplicated, co-expressed with their paralogs, narrowly expressed at lower levels, less conserved, and less well connected in gene networks relative to GM genes. Although the values of each of these features significantly differed between SM and GM genes, any single feature was ineffective at predicting SM from GM genes. Using machine learning methods to integrate all features, a well performing prediction model was established with a true positive rate of 0.87 and a true negative rate of 0.71. In addition, 86% of known SM genes not used to create the machine learning model were predicted as SM genes, further demonstrating its accuracy. We also demonstrated that the model could be further improved when we distinguished between SM, GM, and junction genes responsible for reactions shared by SM and GM pathways. Application of the prediction model led to the identification of 1,217 A. thaliana genes with previously unknown functions, providing a global, high-confidence estimate of SM gene content in a plant genome.\\n\\nSignificanceSpecialized metabolites are critical for plant-environment interactions, e.g., attracting pollinators or defending against herbivores, and are important sources of plant-based pharmaceuticals. However, it is unclear what proportion of enzyme-encoding genes play roles in specialized metabolism (SM) as opposed to general metabolism (GM) in any plant species. This is because of the diversity of specialized metabolites and the considerable number of incompletely characterized pathways responsible for their production. In addition, SM gene ancestors frequently played roles in GM. We evaluate features distinguishing SM and GM genes and build a computational model that accurately predicts SM genes. Our predictions provide candidates for experimental studies, and our modeling approach can be applied to other species that produce medicinally or industrially useful compounds.",

    "abstract": "The results of most neuroimaging studies are reported in volumetric (e.g., MNI152) or surface (e.g., fsaverage) coordinate systems. Accurate mappings between volumetric and surface coordinate systems can facilitate many applications, such as projecting fMRI group analyses from MNI152/Colin27 to fsaverage for visualization, or projecting resting-state fMRI parcellations from fsaverage to MNI152/Colin27 for volumetric analysis of new data. However, there has been surprisingly little research on this topic. Here, we evaluated three approaches for mapping data between MNI152/Colin27 and fsaverage coordinate systems by simulating the above applications: projection of group-average data from MNI152/Colin27 to fsaverage and projection of fsaverage parcellations to MNI152/Colin27. Two of the approaches are currently widely used. A third approach (registration fusion) was previously proposed, but not widely adopted. Two implementations of the registration fusion (RF) approach were considered, with one implementation utilizing the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs). We found that RF-ANTs performed the best for mapping between fsaverage and MNI152/Colin27, even for new subjects registered to MNI152/Colin27 using a different software tool (FSL FNIRT). This suggests that RF-ANTs would be useful even for researchers not using ANTs. Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the most optimal approach for mapping data to a coordinate system (e.g., fsaverage) is to register individual subjects directly to the coordinate system, rather than via another coordinate system. Only in scenarios where the optimal approach is not possible (e.g., mapping previously published results from MNI152 to fsaverage), should the approaches evaluated in this manuscript be considered. In these scenarios, we recommend RF-ANTs (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/registration/Wu2017_RegistrationFusion).",

    "abstract": "Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 alpha (HNF4) is critical for hepatic differentiation. Recent studies have highlighted its role in inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation and tumor suppression. However, the role of HNF4 in liver regeneration is not known. We hypothesized that hepatocytes modulate HNF4 activity when navigating between differentiated and proliferative states during liver regeneration. Western blot analysis revealed a rapid decline in nuclear and cytoplasmic HNF4 protein levels accompanied with decreased target gene expression within 1 hour after 2/3 partial hepatectomy (post-PH) in C57BL/6J mice. HNF4 protein expression did not recover to the pre-PH levels until day 3. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of HNF4 (HNF4-KO) in mice resulted in 100% mortality post-PH despite increased proliferative marker expression throughout regeneration. Sustained loss of HNF4 target gene expression throughout regeneration indicated HNF4-KO mice were unable to compensate for loss of HNF4 transcriptional activity. Deletion of HNF4 resulted in sustained proliferation accompanied by c-myc and cyclin D1 over expression and a complete deficiency of hepatocyte function after PH. Interestingly, overexpression of degradation-resistant HNF4 in hepatocytes did not prevent initiation of regeneration after PH. Finally, AAV8-mediated reexpression of HNF4 in hepatocytes of HNF4-KO mice post-PH restored HNF4 protein levels, induced target gene expression and improved survival of HNF4-KO mice post-PH. In conclusion, these data indicate that HNF4 reexpression following initial decrease is critical for hepatocytes to exit from cell cycle and resume function during the termination phase of liver regeneration. These results reveal the role of HNF4 in liver regeneration and have implications for therapy of liver failure.",

    "abstract": "In spite of much effort, many aspects of chromosome organisation and segregation in bacteria remain unclear. Even for Escherichia coli, the most widely studied bacterial model organism, we still do not know the underlying mechanisms. Like many other bacteria, the chromosomal origin of replication in E. coli is dynamically positioned throughout the cell cycle. Initially maintained at mid-cell, where replication occurs, origins are subsequently partitioned to opposite quarter positions. The Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complex, MukBEF, which is required for correct chromosome compaction and organisation, has been implicated in this behaviour but the mode of action is unknown. Here, we build on a recent self-organising model for the positioning of E. coli MukBEF, to propose an explanation for the positioning and partitioning of origins. We propose that a specific association of MukBEF with the origin region, results in a non-trivial feedback between the self-organising MukBEF gradient and the origins, leading to accurate positioning and partitioning as an emergent property. We compare the model to quantitative experimental data of origin dynamics and their colocalisation with MukBEF clusters and find excellent agreement. Overall, the model suggests that MukBEF and origins act together as a self-organising system for chromosome segregation and introduces protein self-organisation as an important consideration for future studies of chromosome dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Intra-tumour heterogeneity is the molecular hallmark of renal cancer, and the molecular tumour composition determines the treatment outcome of renal cancer patients. In renal cancer tumourigenesis, in general, different tumour clones evolve over time. We analysed intra-tumour heterogeneity and subclonal mutation patterns in 178 tumour samples obtained from 89 clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients. In an initial discovery phase, whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing data from paired tumour biopsies from 16 ccRCC patients were used to design a gene panel for follow-up analysis. In this second phase, 826 selected genes were targeted at deep coverage in an extended cohort of 89 patients for a detailed analysis of tumour heterogeneity. On average, we found 22 mutations per patient. Pairwise comparison of the two biopsies from the same tumour revealed that on average 62% of the mutations in a patient were detected in one of the two samples. In addition to commonly mutated genes (VHL, PBRM1, SETD2 and BAP1), frequent subclonal mutations with low variant allele frequency (<10%) were observed in TP53 and in mucin coding genes MUC6, MUC16, and MUC3A. Of the 89 ccRCC tumours, 87 (~98%) harboured private mutations, occurring in only one of the paired tumour samples. Clonally exclusive pathway pairs were identified using the WES data set from 16 ccRCC patients. Our findings imply that shared and private mutations significantly contribute to the complexity of differential gene expression and pathway interaction, and might explain clonal evolution of different molecular renal cancer subgroups. Multi-regional sequencing is central for the identification of subclones within ccRCC.",

Here we report the first complete genomes for seven Fusobacterium strains, as well as resequencing of the reference strain F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ATCC 25586 (seven total species, eight total genomes). A highly efficient and cost-effective sequencing pipeline was achieved using sample multiplexing for short-read Illumina (150 bp) and long-read Oxford Nanopore MinION (>80 kbp) platforms, coupled with genome assembly using the open-source software Unicycler. When compared to currently available draft assemblies (previously 24-67 contigs), these genomes are highly accurate and consist of only one complete chromosome. We present the complete genome sequence of F. nucleatum 23726, a genetically tractable and biomedically important strain, and in addition, reveal that the previous F. nucleatum 25586 genome assembly contains a 452 kb genomic inversion that has been corrected using our sequencing and assembly pipeline. To enable the scientific community, we concurrently use these genomes to launch FusoPortal, a repository of interactive and downloadable genomic data, genome maps, gene annotations, and protein functional analysis and classification. In summary, this study provides detailed methods for accurately sequencing, assembling, and annotating Fusobacterium genomes, which will enhance efforts to properly identify virulence proteins that may contribute to a repertoire of diseases including periodontitis, pre-term birth, and colorectal cancer.",

Heterogeneity arises due to the genetic and epigenetic variation of tumor cells in response to microenvironmental interactions and cytotoxic therapy. We explored specific signaling pathway activation in glioblastoma (GBM) by investigating the intratumoral activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways. We present data demonstrating a striking preponderance for mutual exclusivity of MAPK and PI3K activation in GBM tissue, where MAPK activation correlates with proliferation and transcription factor CREB activation and PI3K activation correlates with CD44 expression. Bioinformatic analysis of signaling and CREB-regulated target genes supports the immunohistochemical data, showing that the MAPK-CREB activation correlates with proliferative regions. In-silico analysis suggests that MAPK-CREB signaling activates a pro-inflammatory molecular signature and correlates with a mesenchymal GBM subtype profile, while PI3K-CREB activation correlates with the proneural GBM subtype and a tumor cell invasive gene signature. Overall, the data suggests the existence of intratumoral subtype heterogeneity in GBM and that using combinations of both MAPK and PI3K drug inhibitors is necessary for effective targeted therapy.",

Here, a new statistical approach that captures transcriptional heterogeneity in tumor and adjacent normal (i.e. tumor-free) mRNA expression profiles was developed to identify oncogene candidates that were overexpressed in a subset of breast tumors. Intronic DNA methylation was strongly associated with the overexpression of chromobox 2 (CBX2), an oncogene candidate that was identified using our method but not through prior analytical approaches. CBX2 overexpression in breast tumors was associated with the upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression and is associated with poorer 5-year survival. The predicted function of CBX2 was confirmed in vitro providing the first experimental evidence that CBX2 promotes breast cancer cell growth. Modeling mRNA expression heterogeneity in tumors is a novel powerful approach with the potential to uncover therapeutic targets that benefit subsets of cancer patients.",

Using transcriptomic data from 10,704 tumor and normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, across 26 disease sites, we developed a novel bioinformatics pipeline that distinguishes tumor from normal tissues, based on differential gene expression for 114 metabolic pathways. This pathway dysregulation was confirmed in separate patient populations, further demonstrating the robustness of this approach. A bootstrapping simulation was then applied to assess whether these alterations were biologically meaningful, rather than expected by chance. We provide distinct examples of the types of analysis that can be accomplished with this tool to understand cancer specific metabolic dysregulation, highlighting novel pathways of interest in both common and rare disease sites. Utilizing a pathway mapping approach to understand patterns of metabolic flux, differential drug sensitivity, can accurately be predicted. Further, the identification of Master Metabolic Transcriptional Regulators, whose expression was highly correlated with pathway gene expression, explains why metabolic differences exist in different disease sites. We demonstrate these also have the ability to segregate patient populations and predict responders to different metabolism-targeted therapeutics.",

Active islet regulatory elements preferentially interacted with other active elements, often at distances over 1MB, and we identified target genes for thousands of distal islet enhancers. A third of T2D risk signals mapped in islet enhancers, and target genes regulated by these signals were specifically involved in processes related to protein transport and secretion.

    "abstract": "Ionic homeostasis in the brain involves redistribution of ionic fluxes in several cell types and compartments, including neurons, astrocytes and the extracellular space. How the major ionic activity-dependent fluxes of potassium and sodium are individually regulated remains difficult to dissociate and to track experimentally. We here review recent progress in modeling the ionic fluxes evoked by neuronal activity based on mass conservation. Excitability of neurons indeed relies on inward sodium and outward potassium fluxes during action potential firing. Recently, we have developed a tri-compartment model based on mass-action kinetics equations that account for potassium dynamics between neurons, astrocytes and the extracellular space. This review describes how such type of model can be used to spatially and temporally predict potassium fluxes during various regimes of neuronal activity. In particular, the model initially showed that it takes several seconds for astrocytes to buffer the majority of the potassium rapidly released by neurons in both basal and high regime of activity. Such model can also probe the selective contribution of ionic channels, and revealed for instance that disruption of the main astroglial potassium Kir4.1 channels not only favors the emergence of epileptiform activity, but also dysregulates neuronal excitability specifically during slow rhythmic activities. We here also extend the predictions of the model by assessing the selective contribution of the astroglial and neuronal Na/K ATPase, or volume of the extracellular space on potassium dynamics. We discuss these findings and their implications for neuronal information processing in the healthy and diseased brain.",

Here, we show that increased levels of the nutrient-responsive, post-translational protein modification, O-GlcNAc (O-linked {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine) are present in naive CD4+ T cells from a diet-induced obesity murine model, and elevation in O-GlcNAc leads to increased pro-inflammatory IL-17A production. Importantly, CD4+ T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which secrete IL-17A, are increased in obesity and contribute to the inflammatory milieu. We found increased binding of the Th17 master transcription factor, ROR{gamma}t, at the IL-17 locus and significant alterations in the lipid microenvironment, leading to increased ligands capable of increasing ROR{gamma}t transcriptional activity. Importantly, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid biosynthesis, acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), is necessary for production of these ROR{gamma}t activating ligands and is O-GlcNAcylated. Thus, we have identified O-GlcNAc as a critical link between excess nutrients and pathological inflammation.",
