    "abstract": "Intraspecific diversity informs the demographic and evolutionary histories of populations, and should be a main conservation target. Although approaches exist for identifying relevant biological conservation units, attempts to identify priority conservation areas for intraspecific diversity are scarce, especially within a multi-specific framework. We used neutral molecular data on six European freshwater fish species (Squalius cephalus, Phoxinus phoxinus, Barbatula barbatula, Gobio occitaniae, Leuciscus burdigalensis and Parachondrostoma toxostoma) sampled at the riverscape scale (i.e. the Garonne-Dordogne River basin, France) to determine hot- and cold-spots of genetic diversity, and to identify priority conservation areas using a systematic conservation planning approach. We demonstrate that systematic conservation planning is efficient for identifying priority areas representing a predefined part of the total genetic diversity of a whole landscape. With the exception of private allelic richness, classical genetic diversity indices (allelic richness, genetic uniqueness) were poor predictors for identifying priority areas. Moreover, we identified weak surrogacies among conservation solutions found for each species, implying that conservation solutions are highly species-specific. Nonetheless, we showed that priority areas identified using intraspecific genetic data from multiple species provide more effective conservation solutions than areas identified for single species or on the basis of traditional taxonomic criteria.",

    "abstract": "Women with X chromosome aneuploidy such as 45,X (Turner syndrome) or 47,XXX (Triple X syndrome) present with characteristics including differences in stature, increased cardiovascular disease risk and primary ovarian insufficiency. Many women with X chromosome aneuploidy undergo lifetime clinical monitoring for possible complications. However, ascertainment of cases in the clinic may mean that the phenotypic penetrance is overestimated. Studies of prenatally ascertained X chromosome aneuploidy cases have limited follow-up data and so the long-term consequences into adulthood are often not reported. We aimed to characterise the prevalence and phenotypic consequences of X chromosome aneuploidy in a large population of women over 40 years of age. We detected 30 women with 45,X, 186 with mosaic 45,X/46,XX and 110 with 47,XXX among 244,848 UK Biobank women, using SNP array data. The prevalence of non-mosaic 45,X (1/8,162) and 47,XXX (1/2,226) was lower than expected, but was higher for mosaic 45,X/46,XX (1/1,316). The characteristics of women with 45,X were consistent with the characteristics of a clinically recognised Turner syndrome phenotype, including a 17.2cm shorter stature (SD = 5.72cm; P = 1.5 x 10-53) and 16/30 did not report an age at menarche. The phenotype of women with 47,XXX included taller stature (5.3cm; SD = 5.52cm; P = 5.8 x 10-20), earlier menopause age (5.12 years; SD = 5.1 years; P = 1.2 x 10-14) and a lower fluid intelligence score (24%; SD = 29.7%; P = 3.7 x 10-8). In contrast, the characteristics of women with mosaic 45,X/46,XX were much less pronounced than expected. Women with mosaic 45,X/46,XX were less short, had a normal reproductive lifespan and birth rate, and no reported cardiovascular complications. In conclusion, the availability of data from 244,848 women allowed us to assess the phenotypic penetrance of traits associated with X chromosome aneuploidy in an adult population setting. Our results suggest that the clinical management of women with 45,X/46,XX mosaicism should be minimal, particularly those identified incidentally.\\n\\nFundingNone",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence from genome-wide studies of cancer show that chromatin-mediated epigenetic silencing at large cohorts of genes is strongly linked to a poor prognosis. This mechanism is thought to prevent cell differentiation and enable evasion of the immune system. Drugging the cancer epigenome with small molecule inhibitors to release silenced genes from the repressed state has emerged as a powerful approach for cancer research and drug development. Targets of these inhibitors include chromatin-modifying enzymes that can acquire drug-resistant mutations. In order to directly target a generally conserved feature, elevated trimethyl-lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), we developed the Polycomb-based Transcription Factor (PcTF), a fusion activator that targets methyl-histone marks via its N-terminal H3K27me3-binding motif, and co-regulates sets of silenced genes. Here, we report transcriptome profiling analyses of PcTF-treated breast cancer model cell lines. We identified a set of 19 PcTF-upregulated genes, or PUGs, that were consistent across three distinct breast cancer cell lines. These genes are associated with the interferon response pathway. Our results demonstrate for the first time a chromatin-mediated interferon-related transcriptional response driven by an engineered fusion protein that physically links repressive histone marks with active transcription.",

    "abstract": "Almost every cell in the human body extends a primary cilium. Defective cilia function leads to a set of disorders known as ciliopathies characterised by debilitating developmental defects affecting many tissues. Here we report a new role for regulator of calcineurin 2, RCAN2, in primary cilia function. It localises to centrioles and the basal body and is required to maintain normal cilia length. RCAN2 was identified as the most strongly upregulated gene from a comparative RNAseq analysis of cells in which expression of the Golgi matrix protein giantin had been abolished by gene editing. In contrast to previous work where we showed that depletion of giantin by RNAi results in defects in ciliogenesis and in cilia length control, giantin knockout cells generate normal cilia on serum withdrawal. Furthermore, giantin knockout zebrafish show increased expression of RCAN2. Importantly, suppression of RCAN2 expression in giantin knockout cells results in the same defects in cilia length control seen on RNAi of giantin itself. Together these data define RCAN2 as a regulator of cilia function that can compensate for loss of giantin function.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTumor neoantigens are a driver of cancer immunotherapy response; however, current neoantigen prediction tools produce many candidates that require further prioritization for research/clinical applications. Additional filtration criteria and population-level understanding may help to produce refined lists of putative neoantigens. Herein, we show neoepitope immunogenicity is likely related to measures of peptide novelty and report population-level behavior of these and other metrics.\\n\\nMethodsWe propose four peptide novelty metrics to refine predicted neoantigenicity: tumor vs. paired normal peptide binding affinity difference, tumor vs. paired normal peptide sequence similarity, tumor vs. closest human peptide sequence similarity, and tumor vs. closest microbial peptide sequence similarity. We apply these metrics to tumor neoepitopes predicted from somatic missense mutations in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and a cohort of melanoma patients, as well as to a group of peptides with neoepitope-specific immune response data using an extension of pVAC-Seq [1].\\n\\nResultsWe show neoepitope burden varies across TCGA disease sites and HLA alleles, with surprisingly low repetition of neoepitope sequences across patients or neoepitope preferences among sets of HLA alleles. Only 20.3% of predicted neoepitopes across TCGA patients displayed novel binding change based on our binding affinity difference criteria. Similarity of amino acid sequence was typically high between paired tumor-normal epitopes, but in 24.6% of cases, neoepitopes were more similar to other human peptides, or even to bacterial (56.8% of cases) or viral peptides (15.5% of cases), than their paired normal counterparts. Applied to peptides with neoepitope-specific immune response, a linear model incorporating neoepitope binding affinity, protein sequence similarity between neoepitopes and their closest viral peptides, and paired binding affinity difference was able to predict immunogenicity with an AUROC of 0.66.\\n\\nConclusionsOur proposed neoepitope prioritization criteria emphasize neoepitope novelty and refine patient neoepitope predictions for focus on biologically meaningful candidate neoantigens. We have demonstrated that neoepitopes should be considered not only with respect to their paired normal epitope, but with respect to the entire human proteome, as well as bacterial and viral peptides, with potential implications for neoepitope immunogenicity and personalized vaccines for cancer treatment. We conclude that putative neoantigens are highly variable across individuals as a function of both cancer genetics and personalized HLA repertoire, while the overall behavior of filtration criteria reflects predictable patterns.",

Studies of brain disorders such as Alzheimers disease or depression have adapted tools from graph theory to characterize differences between healthy and patient populations. Here, we conducted a review of clinical network neuroscience, summarizing methodological details from 106 RSFC studies. Although this approach is prevalent and promising, our review identified four challenges. First, the composition of networks varied remarkably in terms of region parcellation and edge definition, which are fundamental to graph analyses. Second, many studies equated the number of connections across graphs, but this is conceptually problematic in clinical populations and may induce spurious group differences. Third, few graph metrics were reported in common, precluding meta-analyses. Fourth, some studies tested hypotheses at one level of the graph without a clear neurobiological rationale or considering how findings at one level (e.g., global topology) are contextualized by another (e.g., modular structure). Based on these themes, we conducted network simulations to demonstrate the impact of specific methodological decisions on case-control comparisons. Finally, we offer suggestions for promoting convergence across clinical studies in order to facilitate progress in this important field.",

Depletion of LDLR, a key lipid metabolism node, decreased M. marinum burden, and corrected infection-induced altered lipid metabolism resulting in decreased LDL and reduced the rate of macrophage transformation into foam cells.

    "abstract": "T7 development in Escherichia coli requires the inhibition of the housekeeping form of the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP), E{sigma}70, by two T7 proteins: Gp2 and Gp5.7. While the biological role of Gp2 is well understood, that of Gp5.7 remains to be fully deciphered. Here, we present results from functional and structural analyses to reveal that Gp5.7 primarily serves to inhibit E{sigma}S, the predominant form of the RNAP in the stationary phase of growth, which accumulates in exponentially growing E. coli as a consequence of buildup of guanosine pentaphosphate ((p)ppGpp) during T7 development. We further demonstrate a requirement of Gp5.7 for T7 development in E. coli cells in the stationary phase of growth. Our finding represents a paradigm for how some lytic phages have evolved distinct mechanisms to inhibit the bacterial transcription machinery to facilitate phage development in bacteria in the exponential and stationary phases of growth.\\n\\nSignificance statementVirus that infect bacteria (phages) represent the most abundant living entities on the planet and many aspects of our fundamental knowledge of phage-bacteria relationships have been derived in the context of exponentially growing bacteria. In the case of the prototypical Escherichia coli phage T7, specific inhibition of the housekeeping form of the RNA polymerase (E{sigma}70) by a T7 protein, called Gp2, is essential for the development of viral progeny. We now reveal that T7 uses a second specific inhibitor that selectively inhibits the stationary phase RNAP (E{sigma}S), which enables T7 to develop well in exponentially growing and stationary phase bacteria. The results have broad implications for our understanding of phage-bacteria relationships and therapeutic application of phages.",

The present work was aimed to study CK signal perception in potato. The sequenced potato genome of doubled monoploid Phureja was used for bioinformatic analysis and as a tool for identification of putative CK receptors from autotetraploid potato cv. Desiree. All basic elements of multistep phosphorelay (MSP) required for CK signal transduction were identified in Phureja genome, including three genes orthologous to three CK receptor genes (AHK 2-4) of Arabidopsis. As distinct from Phureja, autotetraploid potato contains at least two allelic isoforms of each receptor type. Putative receptor genes from Desiree plants were cloned, sequenced and expressed, and main characteristics of encoded proteins, firstly their consensus motifs, structure models, ligand-binding properties, and the ability to transmit CK signal, were determined. In all studied aspects the predicted sensor histidine kinases met the requirements for genuine CK receptors. Expression of potato CK receptors was found to be organ-specific and sensitive to growth conditions, particularly to sucrose content.

Enduring relationships may engender parallel phylogenies among hosts and parasites3,4, but so may more ephemeral relationships when parasites disproportionately colonize related hosts5. When considering these relationships temporal durability, it would be useful to understand whether parasite and host populations have grown and contracted in concert. Here, we devised methods to compare demographic histories, derived from genomic data6. We used these methods to compare the historical growth of the agent of severe human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, to human and primate histories7,8 and to that of their mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae9, thereby discerning long-term parallels and anthropogenic population explosions10,11. The growth history of Trichinella spiralis, a zoonotic parasite disseminated by swine domestication12,13, proved regionally-specific, paralleling distinctive growth histories for wild boar in Asia and Europe14. Parallel histories were inferred for an anemone and its algal symbiont (Aiptasia pallida15 and Symbiodinium minutum16). Concerted growth in potatoes and the agent of potato blight (Solanum tuberosum17 and Phytophthora infestans18) did not commence until the age of potato domestication, helping date the acquisition of this historically consequential fungal plant pathogen. Therefore, comparative historical demography provides a powerful new means by which to interrogate the history of myriad ecological relationships, enriching our understanding of their origins and durability.",

    "abstract": "We previously demonstrated how sharing of rare variants (RVs) in distant affected relatives can be used to identify variants causing a complex and heterogeneous disease. This approach tested whether single RVs were shared by all sequenced affected family members. However, as with other study designs, joint analysis of several RVs (e.g. within genes) is sometimes required to obtain sufficient statistical power. Further, phenocopies can lead to false negatives for some causal RVs if complete sharing among affecteds is required. Here we extend our methodology (Rare Variant Sharing, RVS) to address these issues. Specifically, we introduce gene-based analyses, refine RV definition based on haplotypes, and introduce a partial sharing test based on RV sharing probabilities for subsets of affected family members. RVS also has the desirable features of not requiring external estimates of variant frequency or control samples, provides functionality to assess and address violations of key assumptions, and is available as open source software for genome-wide analysis. Simulations including phenocopies, based on the families of an oral cleft study, revealed the partial and complete sharing versions of RVS achieved similar statistical power compared to alternative methods (RareIBD and the Gene-Based Segregation Test), and had superior power compared to the pedigree Variant Annotation, Analysis and Search Tool (pVAAST) linkage statistic. In studies of multiplex cleft families, analysis of rare single nucleotide variants in the exome of 151 affected relatives from 54 families revealed no significant excess sharing in any one gene, but highlighted different patterns of sharing revealed by the complete and partial sharing tests.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of genetic risk loci for autoimmune diseases. However, the functional variants underlying these disease associations remain largely unknown. There is evidence that microRNA-mediated regulation may play an important role in this context. Therefore, we assessed whether autoimmune disease loci unfold their effects via altering microRNA expression in relevant immune cells.\\n\\nTo this end, we performed microRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses across 115 GWAS regions associated with 12 autoimmune diseases using next-generation sequencing data of 345 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Statistical analyses included the application and extension of a recently proposed framework (joint likelihood mapping), to microRNA expression data and microRNA target gene enrichment analyses of relevant GWAS data.\\n\\nOverall, only a minority of autoimmune disease risk loci may exert their pathophysiologic effects by altering miRNA expression based on JLIM. However, detailed functional fine-mapping revealed two independent GWAS regions harboring autoimmune disease risk SNPs with significant effects on microRNA expression. These relate to SNPs associated with Crohns disease (CD; rs102275) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; rs968567), which affect the expression of miR-1908-5p (prs102275=1.44e-20, prs968567=2.54e-14). In addition, an independent CD risk SNP, rs3853824, was found to alter the expression of miR-3614-5p (p=5.70e-7). To support these findings, we demonstrate that GWAS signals for RA and CD were enriched in genes predicted to be targeted by both miRNAs (all with p<0.05).\\n\\nIn summary, our study points towards a pathophysiological role of miR-1908-5p and miR- 3614-5p in autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "Functional integrity of eukaryotic organelles relies on direct physical contacts between distinct organelles. However, the entity of organelle-tethering factors is not well understood due to lack of means to analyze inter-organelle interactions in living cells. Here we evaluate the split-GFP system for visualizing organelle contact sites in vivo and show its advantages and disadvantages. We observed punctate GFP signals from the split-GFP fragments targeted to any pairs of organelles among the ER, mitochondria, peroxisomes, vacuole and lipid droplets in yeast cells, which suggests that these organelles form contact sites with multiple organelles simultaneously although it is difficult to rule out the possibilities that these organelle contacts sites are artificially formed by the irreversible associations of the split-GFP probes. Importantly, split-GFP signals in the overlapped regions of the ER and mitochondria were mainly co-localized with ERMES, an authentic ER-mitochondria tethering structure, suggesting that split-GFP assembly depends on the preexisting inter-organelle contact sites. We also confirmed that the split-GFP system can be applied to detection of the ER-mitochondria contact sites in HeLa cells. We thus propose that the split-GFP system is a potential tool to observe and analyze inter-organelle contact sites in living yeast and mammalian cells.",

We performed a meta-analysis of seven studies (a total of 1825 stool samples from 684 infants) to investigate effects of EBF compared to non-EBF on infant gut microbiota across different populations. In the first 6 months of life, overall bacterial diversity, gut microbiota age, relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and microbial-predicted pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism were consistently increased; while relative abundances of pathways related to lipid, vitamin metabolism and detoxification were decreased in non-EBF vs. EBF infants. The perturbation in microbial-predicted pathways associated with non-EBF was larger in infants delivered by C-section than delivered vaginally. Longer duration of EBF mitigated diarrhea-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis and the effects of EBF persisted after 6 months of age. These consistent findings across vastly different populations suggest that one of the mechanisms of short and long-term benefits of EBF may be alteration in gut microbes.",

Collectively, these microbes break down and ferment saccharides present in the hosts diet. The model of metabolism for these gut symbionts is rooted in previous analyses of genomes, metagenomes, and metatranscriptomes of this environment. Importantly, there is a correlation between the composition of the gut microbiome and weight gain in the honey bee, suggesting that bacterial production of organic acids might contribute to the observed phenomenon. Here we identify potential metabolic contributions of symbionts within the honey bee gut. We show significant variation in the metabolic capabilities of these microbes, highlighting the fact that although the microbiota appears simple and consistent based on 16S rRNA gene profiling, strains are highly variable in their ability to use specific carbohydrates and produce organic acids. Finally, we confirm that the honey bee core microbes, especially a clade of {gamma}-proteobacteria (i.e. Gilliamella), are highly active in vivo, expressing key enzymatic genes critical for utilizing plant-derived molecules and producing organic acids. These results suggest that Gilliamella, and other core taxa, may contribute significantly to weight gain in the honey bee, specifically through the production of organic acids.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe rapid growth of high-throughput sequencing-based microbiome profiling has yielded tremendous insights into human health and physiology. Data generated from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons are often preprocessed into composition or relative abundance. However, reproducibility has been lacking due to the myriad of different experimental and computational approaches taken in these studies. Microbiome studies may report varying results on the same topic, therefore, meta-analyses examining different microbiome studies to provide robust results are important. So far, there is still a lack of implemented methods to properly examine differential relative abundances of microbial taxonomies and to perform meta-analysis examining the heterogeneity and overall effects across microbiome studies.\\n\\nResultsWe developed an R package  metamicrobiomeR that applies Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) with a zero-inflated beta (BEZI) family (GAMLSS-BEZI) for analysis of microbiome relative abundance datasets. Both simulation studies and application to real microbiome data demonstrate that GAMLSS-BEZI well performs in testing differential relative abundances of microbial taxonomies. Importantly, the estimates from GAMLSS-BEZI are log(odds ratio) of relative abundances between groups and thus are comparable between microbiome studies. As such, we also apply random effects meta-analysis models to pool estimates and their standard errors across microbiome studies. We demonstrate the meta-analysis workflow and highlight the utility of our package on four studies comparing gut microbiomes between male and female infants in the first six months of life.\\n\\nConclusionsGAMLSS-BEZI allows proper examination of microbiome relative abundance data. Random effects meta-analysis models can be directly applied to pool comparable estimates and their standard errors to evaluate the heterogeneity and overall effects across microbiome studies.

    "abstract": "Adult plant resistance (APR) is an enigmatic phenomenon in which resistance genes are ineffective in protecting seedlings from disease but confer robust resistance at maturity. Maize has multiple cases in which genes confer APR to northern leaf spot, a lethal disease caused by Cochliobolus carbonum race 1 (CCR1). The first identified case of APR in maize is encoded by a hypomorphic allele, Hm1A, at the hm1 locus. In contrast, wild type alleles of hm1 provide complete protection at all developmental stages and in every part of the maize plant. Hm1 encodes an NADPH-dependent reductase, which inactivates HC-toxin, a key virulence effector of CCR1. Cloning and characterization of Hm1A ruled out differential transcription or translation for its APR phenotype and identified an amino acid substitution that reduced HC-toxin reductase (HCTR) activity. The possibility of a causal relationship between the weak nature of Hm1A and its APR phenotype was confirmed by the generation of two new APR alleles of Hm1 by mutagenesis. The HCTRs encoded by these new APR alleles had undergone relatively conservative missense changes that partially reduced their enzymatic activity similar to HM1A. No difference in accumulation of HCTR was observed between adult and juvenile plants, suggesting that the susceptibility of seedlings derives from a greater need for HCTR activity, not reduced accumulation of the gene product. Conditions and treatments that altered the photosynthetic output of the host had a dramatic effect on resistance imparted by the APR alleles, demonstrating a link between the energetic or metabolic status of the host and disease resistance affected by HC-toxin catabolism by the APR alleles of HCTR.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYAdult plant resistance (APR) is a phenomenon in which disease resistance genes are able to confer resistance at the adult stages of the plant but somehow fail to do so at the seedling stages. Despite the widespread occurrence of APR in various plant diseases, the mechanism underlying this trait remains obscure. It is not due to the differential transcription of these genes, and here we show that it is also not due to the differential translation or activity of the APR alleles of the maize hm1 gene at different stages of development. Using a combination of molecular genetics, biochemistry and physiology, we present multiple lines of evidence that demonstrate that APR is a feature or symptom of weak forms of resistance. While the mature parts of the plant are metabolically robust enough to manifest resistance, seedling tissues are not, leaving them vulnerable to disease. Growth conditions that compromise the photosynthetic output of the plant further deteriorate the ability of the seedlings to protect themselves from pathogens.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryCharacterization of adult plant resistance in the maize-CCR1 pathosystem reveals a causal link between weak resistance and APR.",

    "abstract": "The massive accumulation of genome-sequences in public databases promoted the proliferation of genome-level phylogenetic analyses in many areas of biological research. However, due to diverse evolutionary and genetic processes, many loci have undesirable properties for phylogenetic reconstruction. These, if undetected, can result in erroneous or biased estimates, particularly when estimating species trees from concatenated datasets. To deal with these problems, we developed GET_PHYLOMARKERS, a pipeline designed to identify high-quality markers to estimate robust genome phylogenies from the orthologous clusters, or the pan-genome matrix (PGM), computed by GET_HOMOLOGUES. In the first context, a set of sequential filters are applied to exclude recombinant alignments and those producing anomalous or poorly resolved trees. Multiple sequence alignments and maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies are computed in parallel on multi-core computers. A ML species tree is estimated from the concatenated set of top-ranking alignments at the DNA or protein levels, using either FastTree or IQ-TREE (IQT). The latter is used by default due to its superior performance revealed in an extensive benchmark analysis. In addition, parsimony and ML phylogenies can be estimated from the PGM.\\n\\nWe demonstrate the practical utility of the software by analyzing 170 Stenotrophomonas genome sequences available in RefSeq and 10 new complete genomes of environmental S. maltophilia complex (Smc) isolates reported herein. A combination of core-genome and PGM analyses was used to revise the molecular systematics of the genus. An unsupervised learning approach that uses a goodness of clustering statistic identified 20 groups within the Smc at a core-genome average nucleotide identity of 95.9% that are perfectly consistent with strongly supported clades on the core- and pan-genome trees. In addition, we identified 14 misclassified RefSeq genome sequences, 12 of them labeled as S. maltophilia, demonstrating the broad utility of the software for phylogenomics and geno-taxonomic studies.

We previously showed that the acetylated histone H4-binding protein BET-1 maintains cell fate by recruiting the histone variant H2A.z. Here, we report that Caenorhabditis elegans tousled-like kinase TLK-1 and the histone H3 chaperone CAF1 maintain cell fate by preventing the incorporation of histone variant H3.3 into nucleosomes, thereby repressing ectopic expression of transcription factors that induce cell-fate specification. Genetic analyses suggested that TLK-1 and BET-1 act in parallel pathways. In tlk-1 mutants, the loss of SIN-3, which promotes histone acetylation, suppressed a defect in cell-fate maintenance in a manner dependent on MYST family histone acetyltransferase MYS-2 and BET-1. sin-3 mutation also suppressed abnormal H3.3 incorporation. Thus, we propose that the regulation and interaction of histone variants play crucial roles in cell-fate maintenance through the regulation of selector genes.",

    "abstract": "The ability to colonize the rhizosphere is an important basics requirement for field application of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strains. There are complex signal exchanges and mutual recognition between microbes and plants. In this study, phosphate-solubilizing Pseudomonas sp. P34, a PGPR strain with affinity to wheat, was isolated from the wheat rhizosphere by wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). The plasmid pTR102 harboring the luciferase luxAB gene was transferred into P34 to create P34-L. The labeled strain was used to track the temporal and spatial characteristics of colonization in wheat rhizosphere and its effects on wheat development. The transcript level of phosphate transporter gene TaPT4, a phosphorus deficiency indicator gene, in wheat roots was monitored by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. The experimental results indicated that there was a high density of stain P34-L within the top 8-cm depth of the wheat rhizosphere on day 36 of wheat growth. The strain could survive in the wheat rhizosphere for a long time, and colonize new spaces in wheat rhizosphere following the extension of wheat roots. Compared with uninoculated wheat plants, those inoculated with P34-L showed significantly increased phosphorus accumulation in leaves, seedling fresh and dry weight, root fresh and dry weight, total root length, and number of root tips, forks, crossings, which showed a great value of application of the strain on wheat production by promoting the root growth and dry matter accumulation. Strain P34-L down-regulated the transcript level of TaPT4 in wheat roots, which means a well phosphorus supplementation environment was established by P34-L.\\n\\nImportanceMany PGPR strains often failed to achieve the desired effects when applied in the field. One major reason for the failure is lack of a special affinity between a certain strain and the target host plant, so those strains have low competitive ability with the indigenous microorganism, and unable to survive constantly in rhizosphere. In this work, a new technique to isolate wheat-specific phosphate-solubilizing PGPR strain by WGA was established. The isolate P34 was confirmed can colonize the wheat rhizosphere, and have significantly ability in promoting phosphorus absorption and wheat growth by luminescence labeling techniques. Furthermore, the phosphate-solubilizing ability of this affinity PGPR strain was verified in gene level by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. These results lay a firm foundation for further research on the relationships between PGPR and their host plants. Meanwhile, this work supplied a potential ideal biofertilizer producing strain for sustainable agriculture.",

    "abstract": "MotivationWhen gene duplication occurs, one of the copies may become free of selective pressure and evolve at an accelerated pace. This has important consequences on the prediction of orthology relationships, since two orthologous genes separated by divergence after duplication may differ in both sequence and function. In this work, we make the distinction between the primary orthologs, which have not been affected by accelerated mutation rates on their evolutionary path, and the secondary orthologs, which have. Similarity-based prediction methods will tend to miss secondary orthologs, whereas phylogeny-based methods cannot separate primary and secondary orthologs. However, both types of orthology have applications in important areas such as gene function prediction and phylogenetic reconstruction, motivating the need for methods that can distinguish the two types.\\n\\nResultsWe formalize the notion of divergence after duplication, and provide a theoretical basis for the inference of primary and secondary orthologs. We then put these ideas to practice with the HyPPO (Hybrid Prediction of Paralogs and Orthologs) framework, which combines ideas from both similarity and phylogeny approaches. We apply our method to simulated and empirical datasets, and show that we achieve superior accuracy in predicting primary orthologs, secondary orthologs and paralogs.\\n\\nAvailabilityHyPPO is a modular framework with a core developed in Python, and is provided with a variety of C++ modules.

Attempts to understand the heritability of complex phenotypes attributable to genome-wide SNP variation data has motivated the analysis of large datasets as well as the development of sophisticated tools to estimate heritability in these datasets.\\n\\nLinear Mixed Models (LMMs) have emerged as a key tool for heritability estimation where the parameters of the LMMs, i.e., the variance components, are related to the heritability attributable to the SNPs analyzed. Likelihood-based inference in LMMs, however, poses serious computational burdens.\\n\\nResultsWe propose a scalable randomized algorithm for estimating variance components in LMMs. Our method is based on a MoM estimator that has a runtime complexity [Formula] for N individuals and M SNPs (where B is a parameter that controls the number of random matrix-vector multiplications). Further, by leveraging the structure of the genotype matrix, we can reduce the time complexity to [Formula].\\n\\nWe demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our method on simulated as well as on empirical data. On standard hardware, our method computes heritability on a dataset of 500, 000 individuals and 100, 000 SNPs in 38 minutes.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe RHE-reg software is made freely available to the research community at: https://github.com/sriramlab/RHE-reg\\n\\nContactsriram@cs.ucla.edu",

Controversy exists as to whether a liver stem/progenitor cell capable of renewing both hepatocytes and BECs exists. Single cell RNA sequencing of freshly isolated human foetal and healthy adult liver identified hepatocyte, hepatoblast and liver progenitor cell (hLPC) populations. hLPCs, found at the interface between hepatocytes and bile ducts in both foetal and adult tissue, were distinguishable from BECs by their negative expression of TROP-2. Prospective isolation followed by in vitro culture demonstrated their potential for expansion and bi-lineage differentiation. The hLPC expression signature was also conserved within expanded cell populations specific to certain cases of liver injury and cancer. These data support the idea of a true progenitor existing within healthy adult liver that can be activated upon injury.

    "abstract": "The family of forkhead box (Fox) transcription factors regulate gonadogenesis and embryogenesis, but the role of foxr1/foxn5 in reproduction is unknown. Evolution of foxr1 in vertebrates was examined and the gene found to exist in most vertebrates, including mammals, ray-finned fish, amphibians, and sauropsids. By quantitative PCR and RNA-seq, we found that foxr1 had an ovarian-specific expression in zebrafish, a common feature of maternal-effect genes. In addition, it was demonstrated using in situ hybridization that foxr1 was a maternally-inherited transcript that was highly expressed even in early-stage oocytes and accumulated in the developing eggs during oogenesis. We also analyzed the function of foxr1 in female reproduction using a zebrafish CRISPR/Cas9 knockout model. It was observed that embryos from the foxr1-deficient females had a significantly lower survival rate whereby they either failed to undergo cell division or underwent abnormal division that culminated in growth arrest at around the mid-blastula transition and early death. These mutant-derived eggs contained a dramatically increased level of p21, a cell cycle inhibitor, and reduced rictor, a component of mTOR and regulator of cell survival, which were in line with the observed growth arrest phenotype. Our study shows for the first time that foxr1 is an essential maternal-effect gene and is required for proper cell division and survival via the p21 and mTOR pathways. These novel findings will broaden our knowledge on the functions of specific maternal factors stored in the developing egg and the underlying mechanisms that contribute to reproductive fitness.\\n\\nSummary sentenceThe foxr1 gene in zebrafish is a novel maternal-effect gene that is required for proper cell division in the earliest stage of embryonic development possibly as a transcriptional factor for cell cycle progression regulators, p21 and rictor.",

To identify additional LOAD risk loci, the we performed the largest GWAS to date (89,769 individuals), analyzing both common and rare variants. We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify four new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, and ADAMTS1).

    "abstract": "Eukaryotes utilize a highly-conserved set of drug efflux transporters to confer pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR). Despite decades of effort interrogating this process, multiple aspects of the PDR process, in particular PDR regulation, remain mysterious. In order to interrogate the regulation of this critical process, we have developed a small-molecule responsive biosensor that couples PDR transcriptional induction to growth rate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We applied this system to genome-wide screens for potential PDR regulators using the homozygous diploid deletion collection. These screens identified and characterized a series of genes with significant but previously uncharacterized roles in the modulation of the yeast PDR in addition to recapitulating previously-known factors involved in PDR regulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that disruptions of the mitotic spindle checkpoint assembly lead to elevated PDR response in response to exposure to certain compounds. These results not only establish our biosensor system as a viable tool to investigate PDR in high-throughput, but also uncovers novel control mechanisms governing PDR response and a previously uncharacterized link between this process and cell cycle regulation.\\n\\nSignificancePleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) is a conserved mechanism by which cells utilize membrane bound pumps to transport chemicals out of the cell. Here, we develop a growth-based biosensor system in yeast that enables high-throughput identification of factors that transcriptionally regulate PDR. Among the novel PDR regulators identified here, we show that spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins, which are important for cell cycle regulation, inhibit hyperactivation of PDR upon drug treatment. This result provides insights into PDR regulation, as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention, particularly in chemoresistant cancers where the cell cycle regulation is often disrupted.",

    "abstract": "Recent investigation established a link between DNA sequences and chromatin architecture and explained the evolutionary conservation of TADs (Topologically Associated Domains) and LADs (Lamina Associated Domains) in mammals. This prompted us to analyse the relationship between chromatin architecture and recombination landscapes of human and mouse. The results revealed that: (1) Blocks of elevated linkage disequilibrium tend to coincide with TADs and isochores, indicating co-evolving regulatory elements and genes in insulated neighbourhood; (2) double strand break (DSB) and recombination frequencies increase in GC-rich TADs, whereas recombination cold spots are typical of LADs; (3) binding and loading of proteins which are critical for DSB and meiotic recombination (Spo11, DMC1, H3K4me3 and PRMD9) are higher in GC-rich TADs. One explanation for these observations is that the occurrence of DSB and recombination in meiotic cells are associated to compositional and epigenetic features (genomic code) that are similar to those guiding the architecture of chromosomes in the interphase nucleus of pre-leptotene spermatocytes.",

    "abstract": "Genomic structural variants (SVs) are distributed nonrandomly across the human genome. These \\\"hotspots\\\" have been implicated in critical evolutionary innovations, as well as serious medical conditions. However, the evolutionary and biomedical features of these hotspots remain incompletely understood. In this study, we analyzed data from 2,504 genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium and constructed a refined map of 1,148 SV hotspots in human genomes. By studying the genomic architecture of these hotspots, we found that both nonallelic homologous recombination and non-homologous mechanisms act as mechanistic drivers of SV formation. We found that the majority of SV hotspots are within gene-poor regions and evolve under relaxed negative selection or neutrality. However, we found that a small subset of SV hotspots harbor genes that are enriched for anthropologically crucial functions, including blood oxygen transport, olfaction, synapse assembly, and antigen binding. We provide evidence that balancing selection may have maintained these SV hotspots, which include two independent hotspots on different chromosomes affecting alpha and beta hemoglobin gene clusters. Biomedically, we found that the SV hotspots coincide with breakpoints of clinically relevant, large de novo SVs, significantly more often than genome-wide expectations. As an example, we showed that the breakpoints of multiple large de novo SVs, which lead to idiopathic short stature, coincide with SV hotspots. As such, the mutational instability in SV hotpots likely enables chromosomal breaks that lead to pathogenic structural variation formations. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the mutational landscape of the genome and implicates both mechanistic and adaptive forces in the formation and maintenance of SV hotspots.",

We hypothesised that the capacity of donor HLA to induce a specific alloantibody response depends on their structural and physicochemical dissimilarity compared to recipient HLA. To test this hypothesis, we first developed a novel computational scoring system that enables quantitative assessment of surface electrostatic potential differences between donor and recipient HLA molecules at the tertiary structure level (electrostatic mismatch score-three dimensional; EMS-3D). We then examined humoral alloimmune responses in healthy females subjected to a standardised injection of donor lymphocytes from their male partner. This analysis showed a strong association between the EMS-3D of donor HLA and donor-specific alloantibody development; this relationship was strongest for HLA-DQ alloantigens. In the clinical transplantation setting, the immunogenic potential of HLA-DRB1 and -DQ mismatches expressed on donor kidneys, as assessed by their EMS-3D, was an independent predictor of development of donor-specific alloantibody after graft failure. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the translational potential of our approach to improve immunological risk assessment and to decrease the burden of humoral alloimmunity in organ transplantation.",

Therefore, this research was aimed at determining the cellular profile of VBNC cells of V. parahaemolyticus upon exposure to the refrigerator temperature. Strains of V. parahaemolyticus were incubated in artificial sea water (ASW) microcosms (pH 6) added with different amounts of NaCl at 4{degrees}C until these pathogens entered into such a dormant state. At a regular time-interval, both culturability and viability of these bacteria were enumerated, and then cellular profiling were carried out in terms of cellular membrane permeability, enzymatic activity, hydrophobicity, fatty acid composition, and morphological changes after cells of V. parahaemolyticus became the VBNC state. Three strains of V. parahaemolyticus used in this study showed that VBNC cells retained the strong virulent properties to Vero and CACO-2 cell lines, re-gained the cytotoxicity even after resuscitation, became permeabilized in terms of the outer membrane, showed lower levels of enzymatic (catalase and glutathione-S-transferase) activities, exerted the increasing hydrophobicity, and then exhibited increasing amounts of saturated fatty acids.\\n\\nIMPORTANCETo the current best knowledge, there are restricted information available on understanding the physiological characterization of viable-but-nonculturable cells. Most previous studies are still making a degree of efforts in discovering the causative effector causing microorganisms to be induced into the VBNC state.

Importantly, it was indicated that VBNC V. parahaemolyticus maintained peculiarly different physiological characteristics. Furthermore, this study proposed a novel approach on the transient/stepwise conversion of the bacteria into the VBNC state. Specific alternative tools for measuring and controlling the incidence of VBNC pathogens on food are not established until now.

Few reports have been focused on the regulation network of {gamma}-PGA synthesis in recent years. In this study, we have demonstrated that Bacillus licheniformis global nitrogen homeostatic regulator TnrA is a direct repressor of {gamma}-PGA synthase PgsBCAA in {gamma}-PGA synthesis. First, our results confirmed that TnrA repressed {gamma}-PGA synthesis, deficiency of tnrA led to a 22.03% increase of {gamma}-PGA production, and the {gamma}-PGA yield was decreased by 19.02% in the TnrA overexpression strain. Transcriptional level assay illustrated that the {gamma}-PGA synthase gene cluster pgsBCAA transcriptional level were increased in the tnrA deficient strain WX{Delta}tnrA, indicating that {gamma}-PGA synthase PgsBCAA was negatively regulated by TnrA. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and enzyme expression assays confirmed that TnrA directly repressed pgsBCAA expression by binding to pgsBCAA promoter, and the TnrA-binding site \\\"CGTCGTCTTCTGTTACA\\\" in the pgsBCAA promoter was identified by sequence and software analysis. Finally, computer analysis confirmed that the transcription regulations of {gamma}-PGA synthase PgsBCAA by TnrA were highly conserved in other well-studied Bacillus species (B. licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens).

Glutamic acid is the precursor for {gamma}-PGA synthesis, which is catalyzed by the {gamma}-PGA synthase PgsBCAA. Previously, the expression of PgsBCAA was reported to be regulated by ComA-ComP and DegS-DegU, DegQ and SwrA systems, however, few researches were focused on the regulation network of {gamma}-PGA synthesis in recent years. In our research, the {gamma}-PGA synthase PgsBCAA was confirmed to be negatively regulated by the nitrogen metabolism regulator TnrA, and the TnrA binding site in the pgsBCAA promoter was identified in B. licheniformis WX-02.

Especially, VBNC cells can be recovered to the culturable state reversibly by removing the causative stress, expressing higher levels of virulence factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if VBNC V. parahaemolyticus strains retain the resuscitation-availability upon eliminating the adverse condition, followed by the enrichment in developed resuscitation-facilitating buffers. Bacterial cells were shown to enter into the VBNC state in artificial sea water (ASW, pH 6) microcosms at 4{degrees}C within 70 days.

Hence, the ability of VBNC V. parahaemolyticus to re-enter into the culturable state was examined, using various resuscitation buffers that were formulated in this study. VBNC cells re-gained the culturability successfully when transferred onto the resuscitation-buffer D, and then incubated at 25{degrees}C for several days. Resuscitation-facilitating agent D is consisting of antioxidizing agents, mineral, an emulsifier, and cell free supernatants from the actively growing cells of V. parahaemolyticus. It appeared that such a reversible conversion of VBNC cells to the culturable state would depend on multiple resuscitation-related channels.",

    "abstract": "Circadian (~24 h) rhythms influence nearly all aspects of physiology, including sleep/wake, metabolism, and hormone release. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronizes these daily rhythms to the external light cycle, but the mechanisms by which this occurs is unclear. The neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is the predominant contributor to synchrony within the SCN and is important for circadian light responses, but the role of VIP neurons themselves is unclear. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that rhythmic SCN VIP neurons mediate circadian light responses. Using in vivo fiber photometry recording of SCN VIP neurons we found daily rhythms in spontaneous calcium events that peaked during the subjective day and in light-evoked calcium events that exhibited the greatest response around subjective dusk. These rhythms were correlated with spontaneous and NMDA-evoked VIP release from SCN VIP neurons in vitro. Finally, in vivo hyperpolarization of VIP neurons attenuated light-induced shifts of daily rhythms in locomotion. We conclude that SCN VIP neurons are circadian and depolarize to light to modulate entrainment of daily rhythms in the SCN and behavior.",

    "abstract": "Each eye movement shifts the projections of the visual scene on the retina. It has been proposed that the receptive fields of neurons in oculomotor areas are remapped pre-saccadically to account for these shifts. While remapping of the whole visual scene seems prohibitively complex, selection by visual attention may limit these processes to a subset of attended locations. Because attentional selection consumes time, remapping of attended locations should evolve in time, too. In our study, we cued a spatial location by presenting an attention capturing cue at different times before a saccade and constructed detailed maps of attentional allocation across the visual field. We observed no remapping when the cue appeared shortly before saccade. In contrast, when the cue appeared sufficiently early before saccade, attentional resources were reallocated to the remapped location. Our results suggest that pre-saccadic remapping is an attentional process relying on the spatial and temporal dynamics of visual attention.",

    "abstract": "For millennia, humans have used plants for medicinal purposes. However, our limited understanding of plant biochemistry hinders the translation of such ancient wisdom into modern pharmaceuticals1. Kava (Piper methysticum) is a medicinal plant native to the Polynesian islands with anxiolytic and analgesic properties supported by over 3,000 years of traditional use as well as numerous recent clinical trials2-5. The main psychoactive principles of kava, kavalactones, are a unique class of polyketide natural products known to interact with central nervous system through mechanisms distinct from those of the prescription psychiatric drugs benzodiazepines and opioids6,7. Here we report de novo elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of kavalactones, consisting of seven specialized metabolic enzymes. Based on phylogenetic and crystallographic analyses, we highlight the emergence of two paralogous styrylpyrone synthases, both of which have neofunctionalized from an ancestral chalcone synthase to catalyze the formation of the kavalactone scaffold. Structurally diverse kavalactones are then biosynthesized by subsequent regio- and stereo-specific tailoring enzymes. We demonstrate the feasibility of engineering heterologous production of kavalactones and their derivatives in bacterial, yeast, and plant hosts, thus opening an avenue towards the development of new psychiatric therapeutics for anxiety disorders, which affect over 260 million people globally8.",

We have shown that the purple color of the abaxial surfaces generates an interesting contrast between the color of the stomata arranged on the epidermis, generally green, and the purple color of the pavement. This contrast makes the stomata completely visible to optic microscopy of the extant plants. This phenomenon made possible the proposition of a strategy to measure the distance between the stomata of the layer. The measurement of the distance between stomata generates accurate information of the distribution of stomata on the epidermis of living purple plants. In future ecophysiological inferences will be established from the information brought about by the measurements of the distance between stomata in purple plants.",

Here we combine Bayesian analysis with global sensitivity analysis in order to give better informed predictions; to point out weaker parts of the model that are important targets for further experiments, as well as give guidance on parameters that are essential in distinguishing different qualitative output behaviours.\\n\\nResultsWe used approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to estimate the model parameters from experimental data, as well as to quantify the uncertainty in this estimation (inverse uncertainty quantification), resulting in a posterior distribution for the parameters. This parameter uncertainty was next propagated to a corresponding uncertainty in the predictions (forward uncertainty propagation), and a global sensitivity analysis was performed on the prediction using the posterior distribution as the possible values for the parameters. This methodology was applied on a relatively large and complex model relevant for synaptic plasticity, using experimental data from several sources. We could hereby point out those parameters that by themselves have the largest contribution to the uncertainty of the prediction as well as identify parameters important to separate between qualitatively different predictions.This approach is useful both for experimental design as well as model building.",

    "abstract": "Suppose we aim to use data obtained by studying a biomolecular interaction system with a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor in quantifying some system feature. We assume a parametric mathematical model for biosensor response due to sources of mass such as analyte-ligand complexes. Some parameters represent interaction features, such as rate constants. Whenever we attempt to estimate parameters from data, we may obtain multiple estimates, regardless of the amount and quality of data. Inconveniently, we may be unable to distinguish between alternatives. This is problematic when alternative parameter values lead to very different predictions of system behaviour for a situation where we lack data. Anticipating this issue prior to data collection allows us to redesign the combination of planned experiments and model, replacing a certain failure to achieve our studys aim with the possibility of success. The literature on SPR biosensors (and computational biology more generally) has paid little attention to this matter. In order to remedy this, it is appropriate to begin with a consideration of the assumed models. These are rarely specified completely, causing ambiguity that impedes scrutiny of their properties and comparison with other models. We demonstrate this by reviewing some model types seen in the Biacore biosensor literature. We propose to eliminate model ambiguity by providing a suitable framework for specifing models for biosensor data. This framework will aid future efforts to compose models for data arising from particular interaction mechanisms in a form that is amenable to scrutiny. We expect that the issues raised here will have relevance to the modelling of data obtained from other apparatus employed in quantifying binding behaviour.",

    "abstract": "The solvent-excluded surface (SES) of a protein is determined by and in turn affects protein-solvent interaction and consequently plays important roles in its solvation, folding and function. However, accurate quantitative relationships between them remain largely unknown at present. To evaluate SESs contribution to protein-solvent interaction we have applied our accurate and robust SES computation algorithm to various sets of proteins and ligand-protein interfaces. Our results show that each of the analyzed water-soluble proteins has a negative net charge on its SES. In addition we have identified a list of SES-defined physical and geometrical properties that likely pertain to protein solvation and folding based on their characteristic changes with protein size, their differences between folded and extended conformations, and their correlations with known hydrophobicity scales and with experimentally-determined protein solubility. The relevance of the list of SES-defined properties to protein structure and function is supported by their differences between water-soluble proteins and transmembrane proteins and between solvent-accessible regions and ligand-binding interfaces. Taken together our analyses reveal the importance of SES for protein solvation, folding and function. In particular the universal enrichment of negative charge and the larger than average SES area for a polar atom on the surface of a water-soluble protein suggest that from a protein-solvent interaction perspective to fold into a native state is to optimize the electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions between solvent molecules and the surface polar atoms of a protein rather than to only minimize its apolar surface area.",

    "abstract": "When plated onto substrates, cell morphology and even stem cell differentiation are influenced by the stiffness of their environment. Stiffer substrates give strongly spread (eventually polarized) cells with strong focal adhesions, and stress fibers; very soft substrates give a less developed cytoskeleton, and much lower cell spreading. The kinetics of this process of cell spreading is studied extensively, and important universal relationships are established on how the cell area grows with time. Here we study the population dynamics of spreading cells, investigating the characteristic processes involved in cell response to the substrate. We show that unlike the individual cell morphology, this population dynamics does not depend on the substrate stiffness. Instead, a strong activation temperature dependence is observed. Different cell lines on different substrates all have long-time statistics controlled by the thermal activation over a single energy barrier {triangleup}G {approx} 19 kcal/mol, while the early-time kinetics follows a power law ~ t5. This implies that the rate of spreading depends on an internal process of adhesion-mechanosensing complex assembly and activation: the operational complex must have 5 component proteins, and the last process in the sequence (which we believe is the activation of focal adhesion kinase) is controlled by the binding energy {triangleup}G.",

Here, by employing both in vivo and in vitro models, we report that METTL14 was indispensable for post-implantation embryonic development by facilitating the conversion from naive to primed state of the epiblast.

However, mathematical models of competition between pathogen strains with differing natural history profiles typically assume that human behaviour is fixed. Here, our objective is to model the influence of social behaviour on the competition between pathogen strains with differing virulence. We couple a compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model for a resident pathogen strain and a mutant strain with higher virulence, with a differential equation of a population where individuals learn to adopt protective behaviour from others according to the prevalence of infection of the two strains and the perceived severity of the respective strains in the population. We perform invasion analysis, time series analysis and phase plane analysis to show that perceived severities of pathogen strains and the efficacy of infection control against them can greatly impact the invasion of more virulent strain. We demonstrate that adaptive social behaviour enables invasion of the mutant strain under plausible epidemiological scenarios, even when the mutant strain has a lower basic reproductive number than the resident strain. Surprisingly, in some situations, increasing the perceived severity of the resident strain can facilitate invasion of the more virulent mutant strain. Our results demonstrate that for certain applications, it may be necessary to include adaptive social behaviour in models of the emergence of virulent pathogens, so that the models can better assist public health efforts to control infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Non-genetic inheritance media, from methyl-accepting cytosines to culture, tend to  mutate more frequently than DNA sequences. Whether or not this makes them inexhaustible suppliers for adaptive evolution will depend on the effect of non-genetic mutations (hereafter epimutations) on fitness-related traits. Here we investigate how the magnitude of these effects might themselves evolve. More specifically, we examine the hypothesis that natural selection could set boundaries to the adaptive potential of non-genetic inheritance media due to their higher mutability. In our model, the genetic and epigenetic contributions to a non-neutral phenotype are controlled by an epistatic modifier locus, which we let evolve under the combined effects of drift and selection, in stable and in variable environments. We show that a pure genetic control evolves when the environment is stable, provided that the population is large enough, such that the phenotype becomes robust to frequent epimutations. When the environment fluctuates, however, the direction of selection on the modifier locus also fluctuates and can overall produce a large non-genetic contribution to the phenotype, especially when the epimutation rate matches the rate of environmental variation. We further show that selection on the modifier locus is mostly direct - i.e. it does not rely on subsequent effects in future generations - as our results are generally insensitive to recombination. These results suggest that unstable inheritance media might significantly contribute to fitness variation of traits subject to highly variable selective pressures, but little to traits responding to scarcely variable aspects of the environment, which likely represent a majority. More generally, our study demonstrates that the rate of mutation and the adaptive potential of any inheritance media should not be seen as independent properties.",

    "abstract": "RNA-seq has emerged as an important technology for measuring gene expression in peripheral blood samples collected from humans and other vertebrate species. In particular, transcriptomics analyses of whole blood can be used to study immunobiology and develop novel biomarkers of infectious disease. However, an obstacle to these methods in many mammalian species is the presence of reticulocyte-derived globin mRNAs in large quantities, which can complicate RNA-seq library sequencing and impede detection of other mRNA transcripts. A range of supplementary procedures for targeted depletion of globin transcripts have, therefore, been developed to alleviate this problem. Here, we use comparative analyses of RNA-seq data sets generated from human, porcine, equine and bovine peripheral blood to systematically assess the impact of globin mRNA on routine transcriptome profiling of whole blood in cattle and horses. The results of these analyses demonstrate that total RNA isolated from equine and bovine peripheral blood contains very low levels of globin mRNA transcripts, thereby negating the need for globin depletion and greatly simplifying blood-based transcriptomic studies in these two domestic species.",

The transposon, an important means of HGT, is recognized as a mobile genetic element that can integrate in plasmids, replicate and transfer to other strains. We have previously reported a novel structure of the Enterococcus faecium-originated Tn1546-ermB element in S. aureus. The emergence of the Tn1546-like element is an emerging problem that requires continuous monitoring. In the present study, we expand the examination of Tn1546-ermB element to ermB-positive methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) (n = 116) and ermB-positive methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (n = 253) during a 16-year period, from 2000 to 2015. PCR mapping showed that 10 MSSA and 10 MRSA carried the Tn1546-ermB element. The 10 MSSA belonged to three sequence types (ST), ST7 (n = 6), ST5 (n = 3), and ST59 (n = 1), and the 10 MRSA belonged to two STs, ST188 (n = 8) and ST965 (n = 2). Since only clonal complex 5 (including ST5, ST85, ST231, and ST371) MRSA, ST8 MRSA and ST5 MSSA have been previously reported to carry Tn1546 plasmids, this is the first report describing the presence of the Tn1546-ermB element in ST7/5/59 MSSA and ST188/965 MRSA.

    "abstract": "Strains of Helicobacter pylori that cause ulcer or gastric cancer typically express a type IV secretion system (T4SS) encoded by the cag pathogenicity island (PAI). CagY is an ortholog of VirB10 that, unlike other VirB10 orthologs, has a large middle repeat region (MRR) with extensive repetitive sequence motifs, which undergo CD4+ T cell-dependent recombination during infection of mice. Recombination in the CagY MRR reduces T4SS function, diminishes the host inflammatory response, and enables the bacteria to colonize at a higher density. Since CagY is known to bind human 5{beta}1 integrin, we tested the hypothesis that recombination in the CagY MRR regulates T4SS function by modulating binding to 5{beta}1 integrin. Using a cell-free microfluidic assay, we found that H. pylori binding to 5{beta}1 integrin under shear flow is dependent on the CagY MRR, but independent of the presence of the T4SS pili, which are only formed when H. pylori is in contact with host cells. Similarly, expression of CagY in the absence of other T4SS genes was necessary and sufficient for whole bacterial cell binding to 5{beta}1 integrin. Bacteria with variant cagY alleles that reduced T4SS function showed comparable reduction in binding to 5{beta}1 integrin, though CagY was still expressed on the bacterial surface. We speculate that cagY-dependent modulation of H. pylori T4SS function is mediated by alterations in binding to 5{beta}1 integrin, which in turn regulates the host inflammatory response so as to maximize persistent infection.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEInfection with H. pylori can cause peptic ulcers, and is the most important risk factor for gastric cancer, the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The major H. pylori virulence factor that determines whether infection causes disease or asymptomatic colonization is the type IV secretion system (T4SS), a sort of molecular syringe that injects bacterial products into gastric epithelial cells and alters host cell physiology. We previously showed that recombination in CagY, an essential T4SS component, modulates the function of the T4SS. Here we found that these recombination events produce parallel changes in specific binding to 5{beta}1 integrin, a host cell receptor that is essential for T4SS-dependent translocation of bacterial effectors. We propose that CagY-dependent binding to 5{beta}1 integrin acts like a molecular rheostat that alters T4SS function and modulates the host immune response to promote persistent infection.",

Development of genetic resistance to seedling blight in maize germplasm requires efficient and accurate quantitative assessment of disease severity. Through artificial inoculation experiments under controlled growth conditions, we determined that host genotype, pathogen genotype, and infection dose influence the extent to which F. graminearum induces shoot elongation and inhibits root growth in maize seedlings. A comparison of fifteen maize inbred lines showed independent variation of these two fungus-induced effects on seedling growth. In a broader survey with nine commercial maize hybrids and three field-collected fungal isolates, there was significant correlation between these seedling growth responses, as well as with later seedling blight severity. Analysis of variance suggested that this variation and the observed correlative relationships were primarily driven by differing pathogenicity of the three fungal isolates. Together, our results indicate that F. graminearum-induced shoot elongation and root reduction in maize seedlings have distinct underlying physiological mechanisms, and that early observations of seedling growth responses can serve as a proxy for investigating natural variation in host resistance and pathogen aggressiveness at later growth stages.",

Here, we describe a new statistical method for calling cells from droplet-based data, based on detecting significant deviations from the expression profile of the ambient solution. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our method has greater power than existing approaches for detecting cell libraries with low UMI counts, while controlling the false discovery rate among detected cells. We also apply our method to real data, where we show that the use of our method results in the retention of distinct cell types that would otherwise have been discarded.",

    "abstract": "Inference of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data has been a long-standing and notoriously difficult task in systems biology. Recently, single-cell transcriptomic data have been massively used for gene regulatory network inference, with both successes and limitations. In the present work we propose an iterative algorithm called WASABI, dedicated to inferring a causal dynamical network from time-stamped single-cell data, which tackles some of the limitations associated with current approaches. We first introduce the concept of waves, which posits that the information provided by an external stimulus will affect genes one-by-one through a cascade, like waves spreading through a network. This concept allows us to infer the network one gene at a time, after genes have been ordered regarding their time of regulation. We then demonstrate the ability of WASABI to correctly infer small networks, which have been simulated in silico using a mechanistic model consisting of coupled piecewise-deterministic Markov processes for the proper description of gene expression at the single-cell level. We finally apply WASABI on in vitro generated data on an avian model of erythroid differentiation. The structure of the resulting gene regulatory network sheds a fascinating new light on the molecular mechanisms controlling this process. In particular, we find no evidence for hub genes and a much more distributed network structure than expected. Interestingly, we find that a majority of genes are under the direct control of the differentiation-inducing stimulus. In conclusion, WASABI is a versatile algorithm which should help biologists to fully exploit the power of time-stamped single-cell data.",

Here, we compare transcriptome data under light-dark cycles to partial proteome and phosphoproteome data, assayed using shotgun mass-spectrometry, from the alga Ostreococcus tauri, the smallest free-living eukaryote. 10% of quantified proteins but two-thirds of phosphoproteins were rhythmic. Mathematical modelling showed that light-stimulated protein synthesis can account for the observed clustering of protein peaks in the daytime. Prompted by night-peaking and apparently dark-stable proteins, we also tested cultures under prolonged darkness, where the proteome changed less than under the diel cycle. The dark-stable, prasinophyte-specific proteins were also reported to accumulate when O. tauri formed lipid droplets. In the phosphoproteome, 39% of rhythmic phospho-sites reached peak levels just before dawn. This anticipatory phosphorylation suggests that a clock-regulated phospho-dawn prepares green cells for daytime functions. Acid-directed and proline-directed protein phosphorylation sites were regulated in antiphase, implicating the clock-related, casein kinases 1 and 2 in phase-specific regulation, alternating with the CMGC protein kinase family. Understanding the dynamic phosphoprotein network should be facilitated by the minimal kinome and proteome of O. tauri.

    "abstract": "Summary ParagraphThe field of gene therapy has been galvanized by the discovery of the highly efficient and adaptable site-specific nuclease system CRISPR/Cas9 from bacteria.1,2 Immunity against therapeutic gene vectors or gene-modifying cargo nullifies the effect of a possible curative treatment and may pose significant safety issues.3-5 Immunocompetent mice treated with CRISPR/Cas9-encoding vectors exhibit humoral and cellular immune responses against the Cas9 protein, that impact the efficacy of treatment and can cause tissue damage.5,6 Most applications aim to temporarily express the Cas9 nuclease in or deliver the protein directly into the target cell. Thus, a putative humoral antibody response may be negligible.5 However, intracellular protein degradation processes lead to peptide presentation of Cas9 fragments on the cellular surface of gene-edited cells that may be recognized by T cells. While a primary T cell response could be prevented or delayed, a pre-existing memory would have major impact. Here, we show the presence of a ubiquitous memory/effector T cell response directed towards the most popular Cas9 homolog from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) within healthy human subjects. We have characterized SpCas9-reactive memory/effector T cells (TEFF) within the CD4/CD8 compartments for multi-effector potency and lineage determination. Intriguingly, SpCas9-specific regulatory T cells (TREG) profoundly contribute to the pre-existing SpCas9-directed T cell immunity. The frequency of SpCas9-reactive TREG cells inversely correlates with the magnitude of the respective TEFF response. SpCas9-specific TREG may be harnessed to ensure the success of SpCas9-mediated gene therapy by combating undesired TEFF response in vivo. Furthermore, the equilibrium of Cas9-specific TEFF and TREG cells may have greater importance in Streptococcus pyogenes-associated diseases. Our results shed light on the T cell mediated immunity towards the much-praised gene scissor SpCas9 and offer a possible solution to overcome the problem of pre-existing immunity.",

While certain potential advantages of manganese oxidation have been suggested, to date there is no conclusive experimental evidence for, how and if this process impacts microbial fitness in the environment. Here we show how a model organism for manganese oxidation, Roseobacter sp. AzwK-3b, is growth-inhibited by nitrite, and that this inhibition is mitigated when manganese is added to the culture medium. We show that manganese-mediated mitigation of nitrite-inhibition is dependent on the culture inoculum size, with larger inocula being able to withstand higher concentrations of nitrite stress. Furthermore, the bio-mineralized manganese oxide (MnOX) forms granular precipitates in the culture, rather than sheaths around individual cells. These findings support the notion that MnOX is a shared community product that improves the cultures survival against nitrite-stress. We show that the mechanistic basis of the MnOX effect involves both its ability to catalyze nitrite oxidation into (non-toxic) nitrate under physiological conditions, and its potential role in influencing redox chemistry around reactive oxygen species (ROS). Taken together, these results provide for the first direct evidence of improved microbial fitness by MnOX deposition in an ecological setting, i.e. mitigation of nitrite toxicity, and point to a key role of MnOX in handling stresses arising from ROS. These findings could be of general relevance for all organisms oxidizing manganese, allowing them to offset costs associated with extracellular bio-mineralization.",

    "abstract": "Reduction of native prion protein (PrP) levels in the brain is an attractive and genetically validated strategy for the treatment or prevention of human prion diseases. However, clinical development of any PrP-reducing therapeutic will require an appropriate pharmacodynamic biomarker: a practical and robust method for quantifying PrP, and reliably demonstrating its reduction, in the central nervous system (CNS) of a living patient. Here we evaluate the potential of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based quantification of human PrP in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to serve as a biomarker for PrP-reducing therapeutics. We show that CSF PrP is highly sensitive to plastic adsorption during handling and storage, but its loss can be minimized by addition of detergent. We find that blood contamination does not affect CSF PrP levels, and that CSF PrP and hemoglobin are uncorrelated, together suggesting that CSF PrP is CNS-derived, supporting its relevance for monitoring the tissue of interest and in keeping with high PrP abundance in brain relative to blood. In a cohort with controlled sample handling, CSF PrP exhibits good within-subject test-retest reliability (mean coefficient of variation 13% in samples collected 8-11 weeks apart), a sufficiently stable baseline to allow therapeutically meaningful reductions in brain PrP to be readily detected in CSF. Together, these findings supply a method for monitoring the effect of a PrP-reducing drug in the CNS, enabling the development of prion disease therapeutics with this mechanism of action.",

    "abstract": "Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated proteins (Cas) have recently opened a new avenue for gene therapy. Cas9 nuclease guided by a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) has been extensively used for genome editing. Currently, three Cas9 orthologs have been adapted for in vivo genome engineering applications: SpyCas9, SauCas9 and CjeCas9. However, additional in vivo editing platforms are needed, in part to enable a greater range of sequences to be accessed via viral vectors, especially those in which Cas9 and sgRNA are combined into a single vector genome. Here, we present an additional in vivo editing platform using Neisseria meningitidis Cas9 (NmeCas9). NmeCas9 is compact, edits with high accuracy, and possesses a distinct PAM, making it an excellent candidate for safe gene therapy applications. We find that NmeCas9 can be used to target the Pcsk9 and Hpd genes in mice. Using tail vein hydrodynamic-based delivery of NmeCas9 plasmid to target the Hpd gene, we successfully reprogrammed the tyrosine degradation pathway in Hereditary Tyrosinemia Type I mice. More importantly, we delivered NmeCas9 with its single-guide RNA in a single recombinant adeno-associated vector (rAAV) to target Pcsk9, resulting in lower cholesterol levels in mice. This all-in-one vector yielded >35% gene modification after two weeks of vector administration, with minimal off-target cleavage in vivo. Our findings indicate that NmeCas9 can facilitate future efforts to correct disease-causing mutations by expanding the targeting scope of RNA-guided nucleases.",

    "abstract": "With 302 neurons and a near complete reconstruction of the neural and muscle anatomy at the cellular level, C. elegans is an ideal candidate organism to study the neuromechanical basis of behavior. Yet, despite the breadth of knowledge about the neurobiology, anatomy and physics of C. elegans, there are still a number of unanswered questions about one of its most basic and fundamental behaviors: forward locomotion. How the rhythmic pattern is generated and propagated along the body is not yet well understood. We report on the development and analysis of a model of forward locomotion that integrates the neuroanatomy, neurophysiology and body mechanics of the worm. Our model is motivated by experimental analysis of the structure of the ventral cord circuitry and the effect of local body curvature on nearby motoneurons. We developed a neuroanatomically-grounded model of the head motoneuron circuit and the ventral nerve cord circuit. We integrated the neural model with an existing biomechanical model of the worm s body, with updated musculature and stretch receptors. Unknown parameters were evolved using an evolutionary algorithm to match the speed of the worm on agar. We performed 100 evolutionary runs and consistently found electrophysiological configurations that reproduced realistic control of forward movement. The ensemble of successful solutions reproduced key experimental observations that they were not designed to fit, including the wavelength and frequency of the propagating wave. Analysis of the ensemble revealed that head motoneurons SMD and RMD are sufficient to drive dorsoventral undulations in the head and neck and that short-range posteriorly-directed proprioceptive feedback is sufficient to propagate the wave along the rest of the body.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian brains have largely lost internal neural regeneration capability except for a few discrete neurogenic niches. After brain injury, the cerebral cortex is especially difficult to repair due to its extremely low rate of adult neurogenesis. Previous studies have converted glial cells into neurons, but the total number of neurons generated is rather limited, casting doubt about its therapeutic potential. Here, we demonstrate that high-efficiency neuroregeneration can be achieved in adult mammalian brains by making use of an engineered AAV Cre-FLEX system to convert a large number of reactive astrocytes into functional neurons. Specifically, using a combination of GFAP::Cre and FLEX-NeuroD1 AAV system, we were able to regenerate enough new neurons from astrocytes to cover about 40% of the neurons lost from an ischemic injury (400 NeuN+ new neurons/mm2), compared to previously reported an average of <1% of cortical neurons (2-8 NeuN+ neurons/mm2) in an ischemic-injured adult mammalian cortex. Importantly, this in situ astrocyte-to-neuron conversion process also improved survival of injured pre-existing neurons, (additional 400 neurons/mm2), leading to a repaired motor cortex with layered cortical structures. Moreover, NeuroD1-converted neurons not only form functional neural circuits but also rescue motor and memory deficits after ischemic injury. Our results establish the proof-of-principle that a highly efficient in situ astrocyte-to-neuron conversion approach provides a novel treatment for neurological disorders that are in need of new neurons.",

The DII sensor and mDII control sensor are driven by the widely used constitutive 35S promoter. However, the reliability of DII sensor has recently been questioned (Bhatia and Heisler, 2018). Here we provide additional evidence to show that the mDII control sensor is indeed uniformly distributed in early leaf primordia, which echoes the original reports (Vernoux et al., 2011; Brunoud et al., 2012). We also use DII/mDII and the PRS5A promoter-driven R2D2 sensors to confirm asymmetric auxin signaling in early leaf primordia. On the other hand, we provide evidence that light penetration may lead to artifacts during whole-mount imaging.",
