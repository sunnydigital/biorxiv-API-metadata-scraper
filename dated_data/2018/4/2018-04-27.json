    "abstract": "The evolution of sexual dimorphism is constrained by a shared genome, leading to  sexual antagonism where different alleles at given loci are favoured by selection in males and females. Despite its wide taxonomic incidence, we know little about the identity, genomic location and evolutionary dynamics of antagonistic genetic variants. To address these deficits, we use sex-specific fitness data from 202 fully sequenced hemiclonal D. melanogaster fly lines to perform a genome-wide association study of sexual antagonism. We identify ~230 chromosomal clusters of candidate antagonistic SNPs. In contradiction to classic theory, we find no clear evidence that the X chromosome is a hotspot for sexually antagonistic variation. Characterising antagonistic SNPs functionally, we find a large excess of missense variants but little enrichment in terms of gene function. We also assess the evolutionary persistence of antagonistic variants by examining extant polymorphism in wild D. melanogaster populations. Remarkably, antagonistic variants are associated with multiple signatures of balancing selection across the D. melanogaster distribution range, indicating widespread and evolutionarily persistent (>10,000 years) genomic constraints. Based on our results, we propose that antagonistic variation accumulates due to constraints on the resolution of sexual conflict over protein coding sequences, thus contributing to the long-term maintenance of heritable fitness variation.",

    "abstract": "Human motor control requires the coordination of muscle activity under the anatomical constraints imposed by the musculoskeletal system. Interactions within the central nervous system are fundamental to motor coordination, but the principles governing functional integration remain poorly understood. We used network analysis to investigate the relationship between anatomical and functional connectivity amongst 36 muscles. Anatomical networks were defined by the physical connections between muscles and functional networks were based on intermuscular coherence assessed during postural tasks. We found a modular structure of functional networks that was strongly shaped by the anatomical constraints of the musculoskeletal system. Changes in postural tasks were associated with a frequency-dependent reconfiguration of the coupling between functional modules. These findings reveal distinct patterns of functional interactions between muscles involved in flexibly organising muscle activity during postural control. Our network approach to the motor system offers a unique window into the neural circuitry driving the musculoskeletal system.",

    "abstract": "Integrating genome-wide association (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data into transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) based on predicted expression can boost power to detect novel disease loci or pinpoint the susceptibility gene at a known disease locus. However, it is often the case that multiple eQTL genes colocalize at disease loci, making the identification of the true susceptibility gene challenging, due to confounding through linkage disequilibrium (LD). To distinguish between true susceptibility genes (where the genetic effect on phenotype is mediated through expression) and colocalization due to LD, we examine an extension of the Mendelian Randomization Egger regression method that allows for LD while only requiring summary association data for both GWAS and eQTL. We derive the standard TWAS approach in the context of Mendelian Randomization and show in simulations that the standard TWAS does not control Type I error for causal gene identification when eQTLs have pleiotropic or LD-confounded effects on disease. In contrast, LD Aware MR-Egger regression can control Type I error in this case while attaining similar power as other methods in situations where these provide valid tests. However, when the direct effects of genetic variants on traits are correlated with the eQTL associations, all of the methods we examined including LD Aware MR-Egger regression can have inflated Type I error. We illustrate these methods by integrating gene expression within a recent large-scale breast cancer GWAS to provide guidance on susceptibility gene identification.",

    "abstract": "Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus epidemics transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have recently (re)emerged and spread throughout the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and elsewhere. Understanding how environmental conditions affect epidemic dynamics is critical for predicting and responding to the geographic and seasonal spread of disease. Specifically, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how seasonal variation in temperature affects epidemic magnitude and duration. Here, we develop a dynamic disease transmission model for dengue virus and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that integrates mechanistic, empirically parameterized, and independently validated mosquito and virus trait thermal responses under seasonally varying temperatures. We examine the influence of seasonal temperature mean, variation, and temperature at the start of the epidemic on disease dynamics. We find that at both constant and seasonally varying temperatures, warmer temperatures at the start of epidemics promote more rapid epidemics due to faster burnout of the susceptible population. By contrast, intermediate temperatures (24-25{degrees}C) at epidemic onset produced the largest epidemics in both constant and seasonally varying temperature regimes. When seasonal temperature variation was low, 25-35{degrees}C annual average temperatures produced the largest epidemics, but this range shifted to cooler temperatures as seasonal temperature variation increased (analogous to previous results for diurnal temperature variation). Tropical and sub-tropical cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza, and Salvador, Brazil; Cali, Cartagena, and Barranquilla, Colombia; Delhi, India; Guangzhou, China; and Manila, Philippines have mean annual temperatures and seasonal temperature ranges that produced the largest epidemics. However, more temperate cities like Shanghai, China had high epidemic suitability because large seasonal variation offset moderate annual average temperatures. By accounting for seasonal variation in temperature, the model provides a baseline for mechanistically understanding environmental suitability for virus transmission by Aedes aegypti. Overlaying the impact of human activities and socioeconomic factors onto this mechanistic temperature-dependent framework is critical for understanding likelihood and magnitude of outbreaks.\\n\\nNon-Technical SummaryMosquito-borne viruses like dengue, Zika, and chikungunya have recently caused large epidemics that are partly driven by temperature. Using a mathematical model built from laboratory experimental data for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and dengue virus, we examine the impact of variation in seasonal temperature regimes on epidemic size and duration. At constant temperatures, both low and high temperatures (20{degrees}C and 35{degrees}C) produce small epidemics, while intermediate temperatures like 25{degrees}C and 30{degrees}C produce much larger epidemics. In seasonally varying temperature environments, epidemics peak more rapidly at higher starting temperatures, while intermediate starting temperatures produce the largest epidemics. Seasonal mean temperatures of 25-35{degrees}C are most suitable for large epidemics when seasonality is low, but in more variable seasonal environments epidemic suitability peaks at lower annual average temperatures. Tropical and sub-tropical cities have the highest temperature suitability for epidemics, but more temperate cities with high seasonal variation also have the potential for very large epidemics.",

Direct coupling analysis (DCA) is popular for intra-protein contact prediction, but extending it to inter-protein contact prediction is challenging since it requires too many interlogs (i.e., interacting homologs) to be effective, which cannot be easily fulfilled especially for a putative interacting protein pair in eukaryotes. We show that deep learning, even trained by only intra-protein contact maps, works much better than DCA for inter-protein contact prediction. We also show that a phylogeny-based method can generate a better multiple sequence alignment for eukaryotes than existing genome-based methods and thus, lead to better inter-protein contact prediction.

    "abstract": "Temperature is a strong driver of vector-borne disease transmission. Yet, for emerging arboviruses we lack fundamental knowledge on the relationship between transmission and temperature. Current models rely on the untested assumption that Zika virus responds similarly to dengue virus, potentially limiting our ability to accurately predict the spread of Zika. We conducted experiments to estimate the thermal performance of Zika virus (ZIKV) in field-derived Aedes aegypti across eight constant temperatures. We observed strong, unimodal effects of temperature on vector competence, extrinsic incubation period, and mosquito survival. We used thermal responses of these traits to update an existing temperature-dependent model to infer temperature effects on ZIKV transmission. ZIKV transmission was optimized at 29{degrees}C, and had a thermal range of 22.7{degrees}C - 34.7{degrees}C. Thus, as temperatures move toward the predicted thermal optimum (29{degrees}C) due to climate change, urbanization, or seasonally, Zika could expand north and into longer seasons. In contrast, areas that are near the thermal optimum were predicted to experience a decrease in overall environmental suitability. We also demonstrate that the predicted thermal minimum for Zika transmission is 5{degrees}C warmer than that of dengue, and current global estimates on the environmental suitability for Zika are greatly over-predicting its possible range.",

Activation of PSCs plays a pivotal role for developing fibrotic reactions to affect themselves or pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs). In the current study, we demonstrated that hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) was secreted from transforming growth factor-{beta}1 (TGF-{beta}1)-treated PSCs. We found that HDGF contributed to anti-apoptosis of PSCs and led to synthesis and depositions of extracellular matrix proteins for stabilizing PSCs/PCCs tumor foci. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein {delta} (CEBPD) responds to TGF-{beta}1 through a reciprocal loop regulation and further activated hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) contributed to up-regulation of HDGF gene. It agrees with the observation that severe stromal growth positively correlated with stromal HDGF and CEBPD in pancreatic cancer specimens. Collectively, the identification of TGF-{beta}1-activated CEBPD/HIF-1/HDGF axis provides new insights for the novel discoveries of HDGF in anti-apoptosis and pro-fibrosis of PSCs and outgrowth of pancreatic cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "AimThe latitudinal diversity gradient is the dominant pattern of life on Earth, but a consensus understanding of its origins has remained elusive. The analysis of recently diverged, hyper-rich invertebrate groups provides an opportunity to investigate latitudinal patterns with the statistical power of large trees while minimizing potentially confounding variation in ecology and history. Here, we synthesize global phylogenetic and macroecological data on a hyperdiverse (>1100 species) ant radiation, Pheidole, and evaluate the roles of three general explanations for the latitudinal gradient: variation in diversification rate, tropical conservatism, and ecological regulation.\\n\\nLocationGlobal.\\n\\nTime PeriodThe past 35 million years.\\n\\nMajor taxa studiedThe hyperdiverse ant genus Pheidole Westwood.\\n\\nMethodsWe assembled geographic data for 1499 species and morphospecies, and inferred a dated phylogeny of Pheidole of 449 species, including 150 species newly sequenced for this study. We tested correlations between diversification rate and latitude with BAMM, HiSSE, GeoSSE, and FiSSE, and examined patterns of diversification as Pheidole spread around the globe.\\n\\nResultsWe found that Pheidole diversification occurred in series of bursts when new continents were colonized, followed by a slowdown in each region. There was no evidence of systematic variation of net diversification rates with latitude across any of the methods. Additionally, we found latitudinal affinity is moderately conserved with a Neotropical ancestor and phylogenetic inertia alone is sufficient to produce the gradient pattern.\\n\\nMain ConclusionsOverall our results are consistent with tropical conservatism explaining the diversity gradient, while providing no evidence that diversification rate varies systematically with latitude. There is evidence of ecological regulation on continental scales through the pattern of diversification after colonization. These results shed light on the mechanisms underlying the diversity gradient, while contributing toward a much-needed invertebrate perspective on global biodiversity dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The results of most neuroimaging studies are reported in volumetric (e.g., MNI152) or surface (e.g., fsaverage) coordinate systems. Accurate mappings between volumetric and surface coordinate systems can facilitate many applications, such as projecting fMRI group analyses from MNI152/Colin27 to fsaverage for visualization, or projecting resting-state fMRI parcellations from fsaverage to MNI152/Colin27 for volumetric analysis of new data. However, there has been surprisingly little research on this topic. Here, we evaluated three approaches for mapping data between MNI152/Colin27 and fsaverage coordinate systems by simulating the above applications: projection of group-average data from MNI152/Colin27 to fsaverage and projection of fsaverage parcellations to MNI152/Colin27. Two of the approaches are currently widely used. A third approach (registration fusion) was previously proposed, but not widely adopted. Two implementations of the registration fusion (RF) approach were considered, with one implementation utilizing the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs). We found that RF-ANTs performed the best for mapping between fsaverage and MNI152/Colin27, even for new subjects registered to MNI152/Colin27 using a different software tool (FSL FNIRT). This suggests that RF-ANTs would be useful even for researchers not using ANTs. Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the most optimal approach for mapping data to a coordinate system (e.g., fsaverage) is to register individual subjects directly to the coordinate system, rather than via another coordinate system. Only in scenarios where the optimal approach is not possible (e.g., mapping previously published results from MNI152 to fsaverage), should the approaches evaluated in this manuscript be considered. In these scenarios, we recommend RF-ANTs (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/registration/Wu2017_RegistrationFusion).",

    "abstract": "Bacterial infection of humans, animals and plants relies heavily on secreted proteases that degrade host defences or activate bacterial toxins. The largest family of proteins secreted by Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, the Autotransporters (ATs), includes key proteolytic virulence factors. There remains uncertainty about the mechanistic steps of the pathway ATs share to exit bacteria, and how it is energetically driven. This study set out to shed light on the AT secretion pathway with the ultimate aim of uncovering novel antimicrobial targets that would be unlikely to trigger the development of resistance mechanisms in bacteria. To do this, two AT virulence factors with distinct proteolytic functions, EspC (secreted from Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli) and AaaA (tethered to the extracellular surface of Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were chosen. EspC and AaaA were fluorescently labelled using two separate methods to establish the localization patterns of ATs as they are secreted from a bacterial cell. Super resolution microscopy revealed that localization of ATs occurs via a helical route along the bacterial cytoskeleton. In addition to requiring the conserved C-terminal {beta}-barrel translocator domain of the AT, we present the first evidence that secretion is dependent on a dynamic interaction with a structure reliant upon the actin homologue MreB and the Sec translocon. These findings provide a step forward in the mechanistic understanding of the secretion of this widely distributed family of proteins that have pivotal roles in bacterial pathogenesis and conserved structural properties that could serve as novel broad-range antimicrobial targets.\\n\\nSignificanceSecreted bacterial proteases facilitate the infection of human, animal and plant hosts by degrading host defences or activating bacterial toxins. The autotransporter family is the largest family of proteins secreted from Gram-negative bacteria, and includes proteolytic virulence factors crucial to bacterial infection. Precisely how autotransporters migrate from the inside to the outside of the cell, and how this movement is energetically driven is a mystery. We demonstrate a spiral pathway of autotransporter secretion, presenting evidence that it involves a dynamic interaction with the actin homologue MreB that comprises the bacterial cytoskeleton. Our findings open the way to unravelling the mechanism of autotransporter secretion and offer the possibility to identify novel antimicrobial targets unlikely to trigger the development of antimicrobial resistance.",

We modelled the function of the auditory system with a deep neural network (DNN) optimized for natural sound recognition. Neurophysiological analysis of the DNN revealed that AM representation similar to the auditory system emerged during the optimization. The better-recognizing DNNs exhibited larger similarity to the auditory system. The control experiments suggest that the cascading architecture, the data structure, and the optimization objective may be essential factors for the lower, middle and higher regions, respectively. The results were consistently observed across independent datasets. These results suggest the emergence of AM representation in the auditory system during optimization for natural sound recognition.",

    "abstract": "Members of the Staphylococcus aureus phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) peptide family are secreted as functional amyloids that serve diverse roles in pathogenicity and may be present as full-length peptides or as naturally occurring truncations. We recently showed that the activity of PSM3, the most toxic member, stems from the formation of cross- fibrils, which are at variance with the cross-{beta} fibrils linked with eukaryotic amyloid pathologies. Here, we show that PSM1 and PSM4, involved in biofilm structuring, form canonical cross-{beta} amyloid fibrils wherein {beta}-sheets tightly mate through steric zipper interfaces, conferring high stability. Contrastingly, a truncated PSM3 has antibacterial activity, forms reversible fibrils, and reveals two polymorphic and atypical {beta}-rich fibril architectures. These architectures are radically different from both the cross- fibrils formed by full-length PSM3, and from the canonical cross-{beta} fibrils. Our results point to structural plasticity being at the basis of the functional diversity exhibited by S. aureus PSMs.",

    "abstract": "The movement of a molecular motor protein along a cytoskeletal track requires communication between enzymatic, polymer-binding, and mechanical elements. Such communication is particularly complex and not well understood in the dynein motor, an ATPase that is comprised of a ring of six AAA domains, a large mechanical element (linker) spanning over the ring, and a microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) that is separated from the AAA ring by a ~135 [A] coiled-coil stalk. We identified mutations in the stalk that disrupt directional motion, have microtubule-independent hyperactive ATPase activity, and nucleotide-independent low affinity for microtubules. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of a mutant that uncouples ATPase activity from directional movement reveal that nucleotide-dependent conformational changes occur normally in one half of the AAA ring, but are disrupted in the other half. The large-scale linker conformational change observed in the wild-type protein is also inhibited, revealing that this conformational change is not required for ATP hydrolysis. These results demonstrate an essential role of the stalk in regulating motor activity and coupling conformational changes across the two halves of the AAA ring.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is orchestrated by the Atg1-Atg13 complex in budding yeast. Under nutrient-rich conditions, Atg13 is maintained in a hyperphosphorylated state by TORC1 kinase. After nutrient starvation, Atg13 is dephosphorylated, triggering Atg1 kinase activity and autophagy induction. The phosphatases that dephosphorylate Atg13 remain uncharacterized. We show that two redundant PP2C phosphatases, Ptc2 and Ptc3, regulate autophagy via dephosphorylating both Atg13 and Atg1. In the absence of these phosphatases, starvation-induced macroautophagy is inhibited, as is the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway, and the recruitment of the essential autophagy machinery to phagophore assembly sites (PAS) is impaired. Despite prolongation of the DNA damage-induced checkpoint in ptc2{Delta} ptc3{Delta} cells, genotoxin-induced autophagy is also blocked. Creating a genomic atg13-8SA allele under its endogenous promoter, lacking key TORC1 phosphorylation sites, bypasses the autophagy defect in ptc2{Delta} ptc3{Delta} strains. Taken together, these results imply that PP2C type phosphatases promote autophagy by regulating Atg1 complex.",

    "abstract": "Ataxin-7 (Atxn7), a subunit of the SAGA chromatin remodeling complex, is subject to polyglutamine expansion at the amino terminus, causing spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a progressive retinal and neurodegenerative disease. Within SAGA, the amino terminus of Atxn7 anchors the Non-stop deubiquitinase to the complex. To understand the consequences of Atxn7-dependent regulation of Non-stop, we sought substrates for Non-stop and discovered the deubiquitinase, dissociated from SAGA, interacts with Arp2/3 and WAVE regulatory complexes (WRC). Protein levels of WRC subunit suppressor of extracellular cAMP receptor (cAR) (SCAR) are regulated by a constant ubiquitination/proteasomal degradation mechanism. Loss of Atxn7 frees Non-stop from SAGA, leading to increased Non-stop interaction with SCAR and also increased SCAR protein levels. A Non-stop enzymatic pocket mutation that increases binding to ubiquitin increased interaction with SCAR, while an enzymatic pocket mutation reducing binding to ubiquitin also reduced binding to SCAR. Loss of Non-stop increased polyubiquitination of SCAR and reduced SCAR protein levels although SCAR protein levels were rescued by protease inhibition. Dependent on conserved WRC interacting receptor sequences (WIRS), Non-stop overexpression increased SCAR protein levels and directed subcellular localization of SCAR, leading to decreased cell area and decreased number of protrusions. In vivo, heterozygous mutation of Atxn7 rescued haploinsufficiency of SCAR to produce F actin, but heterozygous mutation of SCAR did not significantly rescue retinal axon mistargeting upon knockdown of Atxn7.\\n\\nSummarySAGA subunits Ataxin-7 and Non-stop regulate stability and subcellular localization of WRC subunit SCAR.

    "abstract": "We used electron cryo-micrographs to reconstruct actin filaments with bound AMPPNP ({beta},{gamma}-imidoadenosine 5-triphosphate, an ATP analog), ADP-Pi (ADP with inorganic phosphate) or ADP to resolutions of 3.4 [A], 3.4 [A] and 3.6 [A]. Subunits in the three filaments have nearly identical backbone conformations, so assembly rather than ATP hydrolysis or phosphate dissociation is responsible for their flattened conformation in filaments. Polymerization increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis by changing the conformations of the three ATP phosphates and the side chains of Gln137 and His161 in the active site. Flattening also promotes interactions along both the long-pitch and short-pitch helices. In particular, conformational changes in subdomain 3 open up favorable interactions with the DNase-I binding loop in subdomain 2 of the adjacent subunit. Subunits at the barbed end of the filament are likely to be in this favorable conformation, while monomers are not. This difference explains why filaments grow faster at the barbed end than the pointed end. Loss of hydrogen bonds after phosphate dissociation may account for the greater flexibility of ADP-actin filaments.\\n\\nSignificance StatementActin filaments comprise a major part of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells and serve as tracks for myosin motor proteins. The filaments assemble from actin monomers with a bound ATP. After polymerization, actin rapidly hydrolyzes the bound ATP and slowly dissociates the {gamma}-phosphate. ADP-actin filaments then disassemble to recycle the subunits. Understanding how actin filaments assemble, disassemble and interact with numerous regulatory proteins depends on knowing the structure of the filament. High quality structures of ADP-actin filaments were available, but not of filaments with bound ATP- or with ADP and phosphate. We determined structures of actin filaments with bound AMPPNP (a slowly hydrolyzed ATP analog), ADP and phosphate and ADP by cryo-electron microscopy. These structures show how conformational changes during actin assembly promote ATP hydrolysis and faster growth at one end of the filament than the other.",

    "abstract": "Outer membrane beta barrels (OMBBs) are the proteins on the surface of Gram negative bacteria. These proteins have diverse functions but only a single topology, the beta barrel. It has been suggested that this common fold is a repeat protein with the repeating unit of a beta hairpin. By grouping structurally solved OMBBs by sequence, a detailed evolutionary story unfolds. A strand-number based pathway manifests with progression from a primordial 8-stranded barrel to 16-stranded and then to 18-stranded barrels. The transitions from 16- to 18-stranded barrels show mechanisms of strand number variation without domain duplication, such as a loop to hairpin transition. This indicates that repeat protein topology can be perpetuated without genetic duplication likely because the topology is being enforced by the membrane environment. Moreover, we find the evolutionary trace is particularly prominent in the C-terminal half of OMBBs which may be relevant to understanding OMBB folding pathways.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial growth is an important topic in microbiology and of crucial importance to better understand living cells. Bacterial growth dynamics are quantitatively examined using various methods to determine the physical, chemical or biological features of growing populations. Due to methodological differences, the exponential growth rate, which is a parameter that is representative of growth dynamics, should be differentiated. This study experimentally verified the differentiation in growth rates attributed to different methodologies, and demonstrated that the most popular method, optical turbidity, led to the determination of a lower growth rate in comparison to the methods based on colony formation and ATP abundance, due to a decay effect of reading OD600 during a population increase. Accordingly, the logistic model, which is often applied to growth data reading the OD600, was revised by introducing a new parameter: the decay rate, to compensate for the lowered estimation in growth rates. The modified logistic model not only presented an improved goodness of fit in comparison to the original model but also led to an intriguing finding of a correlation between genome reduction and the decay rate. The decay effect seemed to be partially attributed to the decrease in cell size accompanied by a population increase and was medium dependent. In summary, the present study provides not only a better theoretical tool for the high-throughput studies on bacterial growth dynamics linking with experimental data using optical turbidity to the theoretical analysis with biological importance, but also a valuable insight for understanding the genome evolution and fitness increase in microbial life.",

    "abstract": "Mosaic interspecifically acquired alleles of the multiple transferable resistance (mtr) efflux pump operon correlate with reduced susceptibility to azithromycin in Neisseria gonorrhoeae in epidemiological studies. However, whether and how these alleles cause resistance is unclear. Here, we use population genomics, transformations, and transcriptional analyses to dissect the relationship between variant mtr alleles and azithromycin resistance. We find that the locus encompassing the mtrR transcriptional repressor and the mtrCDE pump is a hotspot of interspecific recombination introducing alleles from N. meningitidis and N. lactamica into N. gonorrhoeae, with multiple rare haplotypes in linkage disequilibrium at mtrD and the mtr promoter region. Transformations demonstrated that resistance is mediated through epistasis between these two loci and that the full length of the mosaic mtrD allele is required. Gene expression profiling revealed the mechanism of resistance in mosaics couples the novel mtrDalleles with promoter mutations enhancing expression of the pump. Overall, our results demonstrate that epistatic interactions at mtr gained from multiple Neisseria has contributed to azithromycin resistance in the gonococcal population.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYNeisseria gonorrhoeae is the sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen responsible for over 100 million cases of gonorrhea worldwide each year. The incidence of reduced susceptibility to the macrolide class antibiotic azithromycin has increased in the past decade; however, a large proportion of the genetic basis of resistance to this drug remains unexplained. Recently, resistance has been shown to be highly associated with mosaic alleles of the multiple transferable resistance (mtr) efflux pump, which have been gained via horizontal gene exchange with other Neisseria. However, if and how these alleles caused resistance was unknown. Here, we demonstrate that resistance has been gained through epistasis between mtrD and the mtr promoter region using evidence from both population genomics and experimental genetic manipulation. Epistasis also acts within the mtrD locus alone, requiring the full length of the gene for phenotypic resistance. Transcriptomic profiling indicates that the mechanism of resistance in mosaics is likely derived from both structural changes to mtrD, coupled with promoter mutations that result in regulatory changes to mtrCDE.",

    "abstract": "It has become increasingly clear that learning in visuomotor rotation tasks, which induce an angular mismatch between movements of the hand and visual feedback, largely results from the combined effort of two distinct processes: implicit motor adaptation and explicit re-aiming. However, it remains unclear how these two processes work together to produce trial-by-trial learning. Previous work has found that implicit motor adaptation operates automatically, regardless of task relevancy, and saturates for large errors. In contrast, little is known about the automaticity of explicit re-aiming and its sensitivity to error magnitude. Here we sought to characterize the automaticity and sensitivity function of these two processes to determine how they work together to facilitate performance in a visuomotor rotation task. We found that implicit adaptation scales relative to the visual error, but only for small perturbations - replicating prior work. In contrast, explicit re-aiming scales linearly for all tested perturbation sizes. Furthermore, the consistency of the perturbation appears to diminish both implicit adaptation and explicit re-aiming, but to different degrees. Whereas implicit adaptation always displayed a response to the error, explicit re-aiming was only engaged when errors displayed a minimal degree of consistency. This comports with the idea that implicit adaptation is obligatory and less flexible, while explicit re-aiming is volitional and flexible.",

Additionally, manual scoring often omits information on SWD confidence/intensity which may be important for the investigation of mechanistic-based research questions. Our objective is to develop an automated method for the detection of SWDs in a mouse model of absence epilepsy that is focused on the characteristics of human scoring of pre-selected events to establish a confidence-based, continuous-valued scoring.\\n\\nMethodsWe develop a support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm for the automated detection of SWDs in the {gamma}2R43Q mouse model of absence epilepsy. The algorithm first identifies putative SWD events using frequency- and amplitude-based peak detection. Four humans scored a set of 2500 putative events identified by the algorithm. Then, using predictors calculated from the wavelet transform of each event and the labels from human scoring, we trained a SVM to classify (SWD/nonSWD) and assign confidence scores to each event identified from 60 24-hour EEG records. We provide a detailed assessment of intra- and inter-rater scoring that demonstrates advantages of automated scoring.\\n\\nResultsThe algorithm scored SWDs along a continuum that is highly correlated with human confidence and that allows us to more effectively characterize ambiguous events. We demonstrate that events along our scoring continuum are temporally and proportionately correlated with abrupt changes in spectral power bands relevant to normal behavioral states including sleep.\\n\\nSignificanceWhile there are automated and semi-automated methods for the detection of SWDs in humans and rats, we contribute to the need for continued development of SWD detection in mice.

Here, our goal was twofold. First, we were interested in delineating connectivity patterns between distinct regions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, known to have topologically distinct connectivity patterns with cortex. Our second goal was to quantify age-differences in these cerebellar-striatal circuits. We performed a targeted rs-fMRI analysis of the cerebellum and basal ganglia in 33 YA and 31 OA individuals. In the YA, we found significant connectivity both within and between the cerebellum and basal ganglia, in patterns supporting semi-discrete circuits that may differentially subserve motor and cognitive performance. We found a shift in connectivity, from one of synchrony in YA, to asynchrony in OA, resulting in substantial age differences. Connectivity was also associated with behavior.

    "abstract": "The glycine betaine symporter BetP regulates the osmotic stress response of Corynebacterium glutamicum, a soil bacterium used extensively in biotechnology. Although BetP is a homotrimer, biochemical studies have shown that each protomer is able to transport its substrate independently. Crystallographic structures of BetP have been determined in several conformations, seemingly capturing outward-open, inward-open and occluded states, both loaded with the substrate and in the apo form. However, it has been challenging to establish a correspondence between each of these structures and specific states in the mechanism of the transporter under more physiological conditions. To this end, we examined the dynamics of spin-labelled BetP using pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR) under different stimuli. We then carried out molecular simulations of structures of the BetP monomer to interpret the PELDOR data, using the enhanced-sampling methodology EBMetaD (1), whereby the dynamics of the protein are minimally biased so as to reproduce the experimental data. Comparison of the magnitude of the biasing work required for different input structures permitted us to assign them to specific states of the transport cycle under each of the experimental conditions. In particular, this analysis showed that BetP adopts inward-facing conformations in the presence of excess sodium, and a mixture of states when betaine is added. These studies better delineate the major conformations adopted by BetP in its transport cycle, and therefore provide important insights into its mechanism. More broadly, we illustrate how integrative simulations can aid interpretation of ambiguous structural and spectroscopic data on membrane proteins.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Personalized cancer vaccine strategies directed at tumor neoantigens derived from somatic mutations in the DNA are currently under prospective evaluation1, 2. Alterations in tumor RNA, rather than DNA, may also represent a previously-unexplored source of neoantigens. Here, we show that intron retention, a widespread feature of cancer transcriptomes3, 4, represents a novel source of tumor neoantigens. We developed an in silico approach to identify retained intron neoantigens from RNA sequencing data and applied this methodology to tumor samples from patients with melanoma treated with immune checkpoint blockade5, 6, discovering that the retained intron neoantigen burden in these samples augments the DNA-derived, somatic neoantigen burden. We validated the existence of retained intron derived neoantigens by implementing this technique on cancer cell lines with mass spectrometry-derived immunopeptidome data7, 8, revealing that retained intron neoantigens were complexed with MHC I experimentally. Unexpectedly, we observed a trend toward lack of clinical benefit from immune checkpoint blockade in high retained intron load-tumors, which harbored transcriptional signatures consistent with cell cycle dysregulation and DNA damage repair. Our results demonstrate the contribution of transcriptional dysregulation to the overall burden of tumor neoantigens, provide a foundation for augmenting personalized cancer vaccine development with a new class of tumor neoantigens, and demonstrate how global transcriptional dysregulation may impact selective response to immune checkpoint blockade.\\n\\nStatement of significanceWe developed and experimentally validated a computational pipeline to identify a novel class of tumor neoantigens derived from RNA-based intron retention, which is prevalent throughout cancer transcriptomes. The discovery of transcriptionally-derived tumor neoantigens expands the tumor immunopeptidome and contributes potential substrates for personalized cancer vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "Inference of admixture proportions is a classical statistical problem in population genetics. Standard methods implicitly assume that both parents of an individual have the same admixture fraction. However, this is rarely the case in real data. In this paper we show that the distribution of admixture tract lengths in a genome contains information about the admixture proportions of the ancestors of an individual. We develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework for estimating the admixture proportions of the immediate ancestors of an individual, i.e. a type of decomposition of an individuals admixture proportions into further subsets of ancestral proportions in the ancestors. Based on a genealogical model for admixture tracts, we develop an efficient algorithm for computing the sampling probability of the genome from a single individual, as a function of the admixture proportions of the ancestors of this individual. This allows us to perform probabilistic inference of admixture proportions of ancestors only using the genome of an extant individual. We perform extensive simulations to quantify the error in the estimation of ancestral admixture proportions under various conditions. To illustrate the utility of the method, we apply it to real genetic data.\n\nAuthor summaryAncestry inference is an important problem in genetics and is used commercially by a number of companies affecting millions of consumers of genetic ancestry tests. In this paper, we show that it is possible, not only to estimate the ancestry fractions of an individual, but also, with some uncertainty, to estimate the ancestry fractions of an individuals ancestors. For example, if an individual traces his/her ancestry 50% to Asia and 50% to Europe, it is possible to distinguish between the individual having two parents that each are 50:50 composites of Asian and European ancestry, or one parent from Asia and one from Europe. It is likewise also possible to make inferences about grandparents. We present a computationally efficient method for making such inferences called PedMix. PedMix is based on a probabilistic model for the descendant and the recent ancestors. PedMix infers admixture proportions of recent ancestors (parents, grandparents or even great grandparents) using whole-genome genetic variation data from a focal individual. Results on both simulated and real data show that PedMix performs reasonably well in most scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Neural oscillations can improve the fidelity of neural coding by grouping action potentials into synchronous windows of activity but this same effect can interfere with coding when action potentials become \"over-synchronized\". Diseases ranging from Parkinsons to epilepsy suggest such over-synchronization can lead to pathological outcomes, but the precise boundary separating healthy from pathological synchrony remains an open theoretical problem. In this paper, we focus on measuring the costs of translating from an aperiodic code to a rhythmic one and use the errors introduced in this translation to predict the rise of pathological results. We study a simple model of entrainment featuring a pacemaker population coupled to biophysical neurons. This model shows that \"error\" in individual cells computations can be traded for population-level synchronization of spike-times. But in this model error and synchronization are not traded linearly, but nonlinearly. The bulk of synchronization happens early with relatively low error. To predict this phenomenon we conceive of \"voltage budget analysis\", where small time windows of membrane voltage in single cells can be partitioned into \"oscillatory\" and \"computational\"  terms. By comparing these terms we discover a set of inequalities that align with an inflection point in the curve of measured errors. In particular, when the entrainment and computational voltage terms are equal, the error curve plateaus. We show this point serves as a reliable natural boundary to define pathological synchrony in neurons. We also derive optimal algorithms for exchanging computational error with population synchrony.\n\nNew and Noteworthy. We establish exact conditions for when rhythmic entrainment of precise spike-times in a neural population will improve or harm its ability to communicate.",

Using this method, we super-resolve wide-field images acquired with low numerical aperture objective lenses, matching the resolution that is acquired using high numerical aperture objectives. We also demonstrate that diffraction-limited confocal microscopy images can be transformed by the same framework into super-resolved fluorescence images, matching the image resolution acquired with a stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscope. The deep network rapidly outputs these super-resolution images, without any iterations or parameter search, and even works for types of samples that it was not trained for.",

    "abstract": "DNA origami, a method for constructing nanoscale objects, relies on a long single strand of DNA to act as the \\\"scaffold\\\" to template assembly of numerous short DNA oligonucleotide \\\"staples\\\". The ability to generate custom scaffold sequences can greatly benefit DNA origami design processes. Custom scaffold sequences can provide better control of the overall size of the final object and better control of low-level structural details, such as locations of specific base pairs within an object. Filamentous bacteriophages and related phagemids can work well as sources of custom scaffold DNA. However, scaffolds derived from phages require inclusion of multi-kilobase DNA sequences in order to grow in host bacteria, and thus cannot be altered or removed. These fixed-sequence regions constrain the design possibilities of DNA origami. Here we report the construction of a novel phagemid, pScaf, to produce scaffolds that have a custom sequence with a much smaller fixed region of only 381 bases. We used pScaf to generate new scaffolds ranging in size from 1,512 to 10,080 bases and demonstrated their use in various DNA origami shapes and assemblies. We anticipate our pScaf phagemid will enhance development of the DNA origami method and its future applications.",

While this fence function is believed to arise from the interaction of four-pass transmembrane claudins, the complexity of tight junctions has made direct evidence of their role as a putative diffusion barrier difficult to obtain. Here we address this challenge by reconstituting claudin-4 into giant unilamellar vesicles using microfluidic jetting. We find that reconstituted claudin-4 is sufficient to form adhesive interfaces between unilamellar vesicles without accessory proteins present in vivo. By controlling the molecular composition of the inner and outer leaflets of jetted membranes, we show that claudin-4-mediated interfaces can drive partitioning of extracellular membrane proteins but not of inner or outer leaflet lipids. Our findings indicate that homotypic interactions of claudins and their small size can contribute to the polarization of epithelial cells.",

Here, we use Drosophila to explore the temporal robustness of embryonic development within physiologically normal temperatures. We find that development is temporally very precise across a wide range of temperatures in all three Drosophila species investigated. However, we find temperature dependence in the heterochronicity. A simple model incorporating history-dependence can explain the developmental temporal trajectories. Interestingly, the history-dependence is temperature specific with either effective negative or positive feedback at different temperatures. We also find that embryos are surprisingly robust to shifting temperatures during embryogenesis. We further identify differences between tropical and temperate species that are suggestive of different potential mechanisms regulating temporal development depending on the local environment. Overall, our data shows that Drosophila embryonic development is temporally robust across a wide range of temperatures but there are species specific differences.",

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryGlioblastoma (GBM) remains uniformly lethal, and, despite a large accumulation of immune cells in the microenvironment, there is limited anti-tumor immune response, even with newly developed immune checkpoint therapies. To overcome these challenges and enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies, a comprehensive understanding of the immune system in GBM and changes during disease progression is required. Here, we integrated multi-parameter flow cytometry and mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF) analysis of patient blood to determine changes in the immune system among tumor types and over disease progression. Utilizing multi-parameter flow cytometry analysis in a cohort of over 250 patients with brain tumors ranging from benign to malignant primary and metastatic, we found that GBM patients had a significant elevation in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in blood, but not immunosuppressive T regulatory cells. We validated these findings in GBM patient tissue and found that increased numbers of MDSCs in recurrent GBM portended poor prognosis. CyTOF analysis of peripheral blood from a cohort of newly diagnosed GBM patients revealed that reduction in MDSC frequency over time is accompanied by a concomitant increase in dendritic cells and natural killer cells. This reduced MDSC profile was present in GBM patients with extended survival and was similar to that of low-grade glioma (LGG) patients. Our findings provide a rationale for developing strategies to target MDSCs, which are elevated in GBM patients and predict poor prognosis, either by directly targeting or by shifting the immune profile to induce differentiation toward the immune profile of LGGs.",

    "abstract": "Mutation rates can evolve through genetic drift, indirect selection due to genetic hitchhiking, or direct selection on the physicochemical cost of high fidelity. However, for many systems, it has been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their extremely high mutation rates are advantageous, because they may allow for increased adaptability. This argument has profound implications, as it suggests that pathogenesis in many viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here we present data for an alternative model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3DG64S, has a significant replication defect and that wild type and 3DG64S populations have similar adaptability in two distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3DG64S under r-selection led to reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3DG64S exhibited delayed morbidity at doses well above the LD50, consistent with attenuation by slower growth as opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3DG64S growth defect restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more important than accuracy. In contrast to what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find that within host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic diversity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMutation rate evolution has long been a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology. The polymerases of RNA viruses generally lack proofreading activity and exhibit extremely high mutation rates. Since most mutations are deleterious and mutation rates are tuned by natural selection, we asked why hasnt the virus evolved to have a lower mutation rate? We used experimental evolution and a murine infection model to show that RNA virus mutation rates may actually be too high and are not necessarily adaptive. Rather, our data indicate that viral mutation rates are driven higher as a result of selection for viruses with faster replication kinetics. We suggest that viruses have high mutation rates, not because they facilitate adaption, but because it is hard to be both fast and accurate.",

    "abstract": "The authors declare no conflict of interest\\n\\nFunding sources: the Academy of Finland, Science for Life Laboratories, Tryggers Foundation, the Swedish Research Council VR and the Swedish Foundation for strategic research\\n\\nAbstractOxygen stratified lakes are typical for the boreal zone, and also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions in the region. Due to shallow light penetration, restricting the growth of phototrophic organisms, and large allochthonous organic carbon inputs from the catchment area, the lake metabolism is expected to be dominated by heterotrophic organisms. In this study we test this assumption and show that the potential for autotrophic carbon fixation and internal carbon cycling is high throughout the water column. Further, we show that during the summer stratification carbon fixation can exceed respiration in a boreal lake even below the euphotic zone. Metagenome assembled genomes and 16S profiling of a vertical transect of the lake revealed multiple organisms in oxygen depleted compartment belonging to novel or poorly characterized phyla. Many of these organisms were chemolithotrophic, deriving their energy from reactions related to sulfur, iron and nitrogen transformations. The community as well as the functions were stratified following the redox potentials. The autotrophic potential in the lake metagenome below the oxygenic zone was high, pointing towards a need for revising our concepts of internal carbon cycling in boreal lakes. Further, the importance of chemolithoautotrophy for the internal carbon cycling suggests that many predicted climate change associated changes in the physical properties of the lake, such as altered mixing patterns, likely have consequences for the whole lake metabolism even beyond the impact to the phototrophic community.\\n\\nImportanceAutotrophic organisms at the base of the food web are the only life form capable of turning inorganic carbon into organic form, facilitating the survival of all other organisms. In certain environments the autotrophic production is limited by environmental conditions and the food web is supported by carbon coming from outside the ecosystem. One such environment is stratified boreal lakes, which are one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the boreal region. Thus, carbon cycling in these habitats is of outmost importance for the future climate. Here we demonstrate a high potential for internal carbon cycling via phototrophic and novel chemolithotrophic organisms in the dark and anoxic layers of a boreal lake. Our results significantly increase our knowledge on the microbial communities and their metabolic potential in oxygen depleted freshwaters and help to understand and predict how climate change induced alterations could impact the lake carbon dynamics.",

The histone-H3 variant, CENP-A, is the epigenetic mark that specifies centromere identity5-8. Paradoxically, CENP-A normally assembles on particular sequences at specific genomic locations. To gain insight into the specification of complex centromeres we took an evolutionary approach, fully assembling genomes and centromeres of related fission yeasts. Centromere domain organization, but not sequence, is conserved between Schizosaccharomyces pombe, S. octosporus and S. cryophilus with a central CENP-ACnp1 domain flanked by heterochromatic outer-repeat regions. Conserved syntenic clusters of tRNA genes and 5S rRNA genes occur across the centromeres of S. octosporus and S. cryophilus, suggesting conserved function. Remarkably, non-homologous centromere central-core sequences from S. octosporus are recognized in S. pombe, resulting in cross-species establishment of CENP-ACnp1 chromatin and functional kinetochores. Therefore, despite the lack of sequence conservation, Schizosaccharomyces centromere DNA possesses intrinsic conserved properties that promote assembly of CENP-A chromatin. Thus, centromere DNA can be recognized and function over unprecedented evolutionary timescales.",

    "abstract": "Surfing motility is a novel form of surface adaptation exhibited by the nosocomial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in the presence of the glycoprotein mucin that is found in high abundance at mucosal surfaces especially the lungs of cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis patients. Here we investigated the adaptive antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa under conditions in which surfing occurs compared to cells undergoing swimming. P. aeruginosa surfing cells were significantly more resistant to several classes of antibiotics including aminoglycosides, carbapenems, polymyxins, and fluroquinolones. This was confirmed by incorporation of antibiotics into growth medium, which revealed a concentration-dependent inhibition of surfing motility that occurred at concentrations much higher than those needed to inhibit swimming. To investigate the basis of resistance, RNA-Seq was performed and revealed that surfing influenced the expression of numerous genes. Included amongst genes dysregulated under surfing conditions were multiple genes from the Pseudomonas resistome, which are known to affect antibiotic resistance when mutated. Screening transposon mutants in these surfing-dysregulated resistome genes revealed that several of these mutants exhibited changes in susceptibility to one or more antibiotics under surfing conditions, consistent with a contribution to the observed adaptive resistance. In particular, several mutants in resistome genes, including armR, recG, atpB, clpS, nuoB, and certain hypothetical genes such as PA5130, PA3576 and PA4292, showed contributions to broad-spectrum resistance under surfing conditions and could be complemented by their respective cloned genes. Therefore, we propose that surfing adaption led to extensive multidrug adaptive resistance as a result of the collective dysregulation of diverse genes.",

Out of 150 recruited patients, 147 were included in the intent to treat analysis (ITT); 133 finished the study per protocol (PP). PP data analysis revealed the occurrence of enamel caries [&ge;] ICDAS code 1 in 54.7% of the HAP group patients compared to 60.9% of the fluoride control. In the ITT analysis the corresponding numbers were 56.8% (HAP) and 61.6% (control).

Regarding all assessed secondary outcomes (enamel caries [&ge;] ICDAS code 2, GI, PlI) no significant differences between both experimental groups were observed. Within the restraints set by design and study population of this trial microcrystalline HAP as ingredient of toothpaste may thus be regarded a promising supplement to fluorides in clinical caries prevention (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02705456).",

    "abstract": "The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) group A variant with the 72-nucleotide duplication in the G gene, genotype ON1, was first detected in Kilifi in 2012 and has almost completely replaced previously circulating genotype GA2 strains. This replacement suggests some fitness advantage of ON1 over the GA2 viruses, and might be accompanied by important genomic substitutions in ON1 viruses. Close observation of such a new virus introduction over time provides an opportunity to better understand the transmission and evolutionary dynamics of the pathogen. We have generated and analyzed 184 RSV-A whole genome sequences (WGS) from Kilifi (Kenya) collected between 2011 and 2016, the first ON1 genomes from Africa and the largest collection globally from a single location. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that RSV-A transmission into this coastal Kenya location is characterized by multiple introductions of viral lineages from diverse origins but with varied success in local transmission. We identify signature amino acid substitutions between ON1 and GA2 viruses within genes encoding the surface proteins (G, F), polymerase (L) and matrix M2-1 proteins, some of which were identified as positively selected, and thereby provide an enhanced picture of RSV-A diversity. Furthermore, five of the eleven RSV open reading frames (ORF) (i.e. G, F, L, N and P), analyzed separately, formed distinct phylogenetic clusters for the two genotypes. This might suggest that coding regions outside of the most frequently studied G ORF play a role in the adaptation of RSV to host populations with the alternative possibility that some of the substitutions are nothing more than genetic hitchhikers. Our analysis provides insight into the epidemiological processes that define RSV spread, highlights the genetic substitutions that characterize emerging strains, and demonstrates the utility of large-scale WGS in molecular epidemiological studies.\\n\\nAuthor summaryRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading viral cause of severe pneumonia and bronchiolitis among infants and children globally. No vaccine exists to date. The high genetic variability of this RNA virus, characterized by group (A or B), genotype (within group) and variant (within genotype) replacement in populations, may pose a challenge to effective vaccine design by enabling immune response escape. To date most sequence data exists for the highly variable G gene encoding the RSV attachment protein, and there is little globally-sampled RSV genomic data to provide a fine resolution of the epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics of the pathogen. Here we use long-term RSV surveillance in coastal Kenya to track the introduction, spread and evolution of a new RSV genotype known as ON1 (having a 72-nucleotide duplication in the G gene). We present a set of 184 RSV-A whole genomes, including 176 of RSV ON1 (the first from Africa), describe patterns of local ON1 spread and show genome-wide changes between the two major RSV-A genotypes that may define the pathogens adaptation to the host. These findings have implications for vaccine design and improved understanding of RSV epidemiology and evolution.",

    "abstract": "The global dissemination of colistin resistance has received a great deal of attention. Recently, the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance encoded by mcr-1 and mcr-2 genes in Escherichia coli (E.coli) strains from animals, food, and patients in China have been reported continuously. To make clear the colisin resistance and mcr gene spread in domestic animals in Jiangsu Province, we collected fecael swabs from pigs, chicken and cattle at different age distributed in intensive feeding farms. The selected chromogenic agar and mcr-PCR were used to screen the colisin resistance and mcr gene carriage. Colistin resistant E.coli colonies were identified from 54.25 % (440/811) pig faecal swabs, from 35.96 % (443/1232) chicken faecal swabs, and 26.92 % (42/156) from cattle faecal swabs. Of all the colisin resistant E.coli colonies, the positive amplifications of mcr-1 were significantly higher than mcr-2. The mcr-1 prevalence was 68.86 % (303/440) in pigs, 87.58 % (388/443) in chicken, and 71.43 % (30/42), compared with 46.82 % (206/440) in pigs, 14.90 % (66/443) in chicken, and 19.05 % (8/42) in cattle of prevalence of mcr-2. Co-occurrence of mcr-1 and mcr-2 was identified in 20 % (88/440) in pigs, 7.22 % (32/443) in chickens, and in 9.52 % (4/42) cattle. These data indicate that mcr was the most important colistin resistance mechanism. Interventions and alternative options are necessary to minimise further dissemination of mcr between food-producing animals and human.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEColistin is recognized one of the last defence lines for the treatment of highly resistant bacteria, but the emergence of resistance that conferred by a transferable plasmid-mediated mcr genes to this vital antibiotic is extremely disturbing. Here, we used E. coli as an index to monitor drug resistance in domestic animals (pigs, chicken and cattle). It was found that the colistin resistance widely occurred at all ages of domestic animals and the mcr-dependent mechanism dominated in E.coli. We also found that the elder and adult animals were a reservoir of resistant strains, suggesting a potential food safety issue and greater public health problems.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial spores are formed within vegetative cells as thick-walled bodies resistant to physical and chemical treatments which allow the persistence and dissemination of the bacterial species. Spore-forming bacteria are natural contaminants of food raw materials and sporulation can occur in many environments from farm to fork. In order to predict spore formation over time, we developed a model that describes both the kinetics of growth and the differentiation of vegetative cells into spores. The model includes a classical growth model with the addition of only two sporulation-specific parameters: the probability of each vegetative cell to sporulate, and the time needed to form a spore once the cell is committed to sporulation. The growth-sporulation model was evaluated using the spore-forming, Gram positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis and the biological meaning of the sporulation-specific parameters was validated using a derivative strain that produces the green fluorescent protein as a marker of sporulation initiation. The model accurately describes the growth and the sporulation kinetics in different environmental conditions and further provides valuable, physiological information on the temporal abilities of vegetative cells to differentiate into spores.\\n\\nImportanceThe growth-sporulation model we developed accurately describes growth and sporulation kinetics. It describes the progressive transition from vegetative cells to spores with sporulation parameters which are meaningful and relevant to the sporulation process. The first parameter is the mean time required for a vegetative cell to differentiate into a spore (i.e. the duration of the sporulation process). The second sporulation parameter is the probability of each vegetative cell forming a spore over time. This parameter assesses how efficient the sporulation process is, how fast vegetative cells sporulate and how synchronous the bacterial population is for sporulation. The model constitutes a very interesting tool to describe the growth and the sporulation kinetics in different environmental conditions and it provides qualitative information on the sporulation of a bacterial population over time.",

MEME, arguably one of the most popular motif discovery software, takes quadratic time with respect to dataset size, leading to excessively long runtimes for large datasets. Therefore, there is a demand for fast programs that can generate results of the same quality as MEME.\\n\\nResultsHere we describe YAMDA, a highly scalable motif discovery software package. It is built on Pytorch, a tensor computation deep learning library with strong GPU acceleration that is highly optimized for tensor operations that are also useful for motifs. YAMDA takes linear time to find motifs as accurately as MEME, completing in seconds or minutes, which translates to speedups over a thousandfold.\\n\\nAvailabilityYAMDA is freely available on Github (https://github.com/daquang/YAMDA)\\n\\nContactdaquang@umich.edu",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThere is a notable absence of consensus on how to generate estimates ofpopulation-level incidence. Incidence is a considerably more sensitive and harder to estimate indicator of epidemiological trends than prevalence. We used a novel hybrid method to estimate HIV incidence by age and sex in a rural district of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.\\n\\nMethodsOur novel method uses an  optimal weighting of estimates based on an implementation of a particular  synthetic cohort approach (interpreting the age/time structure of prevalence, in conjunction with estimates of excess mortality) and biomarkers of  recent infection (combining Lag-Avidity, Bio-Rad Avidity and viral load results to define recent infection, and adapting the method for age-specific incidence estimation). Data were obtained from a population-based cross-sectional HIV survey conducted in Mbongolwane and Eshowe health service areas in 2013.\\n\\nResultsUsing the combined method, we find that age-specific HIV incidence in females rose rapidly during adolescence, from 1.33 cases/100 person-years (95% CI:0.98,1.67) at age 15 to a peak of 5.01/100PY (4.14,5.87) at age 23. In males, incidence was lower, 0.34/100PY (0.00-0.74) at age 15, and rose later, peaking at 3.86/100PY(2.52-5.20) at age 30. Susceptible population-weighted average incidence in females aged 15-29 was estimated at 3.84/100PY (3.36-4.40), in males aged 15-29 at 1.28/100PY(0.68-1.50) and in all individuals aged 15-29 at 2.55/100PY (2.09-2.76). Using the conventional recency biomarker approach, we estimated HIV incidence among females aged 15-29 at 2.99/100PY (1.79-4.36), among males aged 15-29 at 0.87/100PY(0.22-1.60) and among all individuals aged 15-59 at 1.66/100PY (1.13-2.27).\\n\\nDiscussionHIV incidence was very high in women aged 15-30, peaking in the early 20s. Men had lower incidence, which peaked at age 30. The estimates obtained from the hybrid method are more informative than those produced by conventional analysis of biomarker data, and represents a more optimal use of available data than either the age-continuous biomarker or synthetic cohort methods alone. The method is mainly useful at younger ages, where excess mortality is low and uncertainty in the synthetic cohort estimates is reasonably small.\\n\\nConclusionApplication of this method to large-scale population-based HIV prevalence surveys is likely to result in improved incidence surveillance over methods currently in wide use. Reasonably accurate and precise age-specific estimates of incidence are important to target better prevention, diagnosis and care strategies.",

    "abstract": "Health planners use forecasts of key metrics associated with influenza-like-illness (ILI); near-term weekly incidence, week of season onset, week of peak, and intensity of peak. Here, we describe our participation in a weekly prospective ILI forecasting challenge for the United States for the 2016-17 season and subsequent evaluation of our performance. We implemented a metapopulation model framework with 32 model variants. Variants differed from each other in their assumptions about: the force-of-infection (FOI); use of uninformative priors; the use of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and the treatment of regions as either independent or coupled. Individual model variants were chosen subjectively as the basis for our weekly forecasts; however, a subset of coupled models were only available part way through the season. Most frequently, during the 2016-17 season, we chose; FOI variants with both school vacations and humidity terms; uninformative priors; the inclusion of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and coupled regions (when available). Our near-term weekly forecasts substantially over-estimated incidence early in the season when coupled models were not available. However, our forecast accuracy improved in absolute terms and relative to other teams once coupled solutions were available. In retrospective analysis, we found that the 2016-17 season was not typical: on average, coupled models performed better when fit without historically augmented data. Also, we tested a simple ensemble model for the 2016-17 season and found that it underperformed our subjective choice for all forecast targets. In this study, we were able to improve accuracy during a prospective forecasting exercise by coupling dynamics between regions. Although reduction of forecast subjectivity should be a long-term goal, some degree of human intervention is likely to improve forecast accuracy in the medium-term in parallel with the systematic consideration of more sophisticated ensemble approaches.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIt is estimated that there are between 3 and 5 million worldwide annual seasonal cases of severe influenza illness, and between 290 000 and 650 000 respiratory deaths [1]. Influenza-like-illness (ILI) describes a set of symptoms and is a practical way for health-care workers to easily estimate likely influenza cases. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) collects and disseminates ILI information, and has, for the last several years, run a forecasting challenge (the CDC Flu Challenge) for modelers to predict near-term weekly incidence, week of season onset, week of peak, and intensity of peak. We have developed a modeling framework that accounts for a range of mechanisms thought to be important for influenza transmission, such as climatic conditions, school vacations, and coupling between different regions. In this study we describe our forecast procedure for the 2016-17 season and highlight which features of our models resulted in better or worse forecasts. Most notably, we found that when the dynamics of different regions are coupled together, the forecast accuracy improves. We also found that the most accurate forecasts required some level of forecaster interaction, that is, the procedure could not be completely automated without a reduction in accuracy.",

After determining the circulating neuroblastoma miRNome, 743 miRNAs were screened in two independent cohorts of 131 and 54 patients. Evaluation of serum miRNA variance in a model testing for tumor stage, MYCN status, age at diagnosis and overall survival, revealed tumor stage as the most significant factor impacting miRNA abundance in neuroblastoma serum. Differential expression analysis between patients with metastatic and localized disease revealed 9 miRNAs strongly associated with metastatic stage 4 disease in both patient cohorts. Increasing levels of these miRNAs were also observed in serum from xenografted mice bearing human neuroblastoma tumors. Moreover, murine serum miRNA levels were strongly associated with tumor volume, suggesting this miRNA signature may be applied to monitor disease burden.",

    "abstract": "Although X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is associated with cancer cell behaviors, the structure-based function of XIAP in promotion human bladder cancer (BC) invasion is barely explored. Herein, we discovered that ectopic expression of the BIR domains of XIAP rescued the MMP2 activation and invasion in XIAP-deleted BC cells, while Src was further defined as a XIAP downstream negative regulator for MMP2 activation and BC invasion. The inhibition of Src expression by BIR domains was caused by attenuation of Src protein translation upon miR-203 upregulation resulting from direct interaction of BIR2 and BIR3 with E2F1 and Sp1, consequently leading to fully activation of E2F1/Sp1. Our findings provide a novel insight into understanding of specific function of BIR2 and BIR3 of XIAP in BC invasion, which will be highly significant for the design/synthesis of new BIR2/BIR3-based compounds for invasive BC treatment.",

Taking advantage of the availability of crystal structures for CDC25A and CDC25B and using a molecular docking strategy, we carried out hit expansion/optimization. Enzymatic assays revealed that naphthoquinone scaffolds were the most promising CDC25 inhibitors among selected hits. At the molecular level, the compounds acted through a mixed-type mechanism of inhibition of phosphatase activity, involving reversible oxidation of cysteine residues. In 2D cell cultures, the compounds caused arrest of the cell cycle at the G1/S or at the G2/M transition. Mitotic markers analysis and time-lapse microscopy confirmed that CDK1 activity was impaired and that mitotic arrest was followed by death. Finally, studies on 3D organoids derived from intestinal crypt stem cells of Apc/K-Ras mice revealed that the compounds caused arrest of proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Despite the importance of Y-chromosomes in evolution and sex determination, their heterochromatic, repeat-rich nature makes them difficult to sequence and genetically manipulate, and therefore they generally remain poorly understood. For example, the D. melanogaster Y-chromosome, one of the best understood, is widely heterochromatic and composed mainly of highly repetitive sequences, with only a handful of expressed genes scattered throughout its length. Efforts to insert transgenes on this chromosome have thus far relied on either random insertion of transposons (sometimes harboring  landing sites for subsequent integrations) with limited success or on chromosomal translocations, thereby limiting the types of Y-chromosome related questions that could be explored. Here we describe a versatile approach to site-specifically insert transgenes on the Y-chromosome in D. melanogaster via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR. We demonstrate the ability to insert, and detect expression from, fluorescently marked transgenic transgenes at two specific locations on the Y-chromosome, and we utilize these marked Y-chromosomes to detect and quantify rare chromosomal nondisjunction effects. Finally, we discuss how this Y-docking technique could be adapted to other insects to aid in the development of genetic control technologies for the management of insect disease vectors and pests.",

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene replacement is emerging as a safe and effective means of correcting single-gene mutations, and use of AAV vectors for treatment of diseases of the CNS is increasing. AAV-mediated progranulin gene (GRN) delivery has been proposed as a treatment for GRN-deficient frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), and two recent studies using focal intraparenchymal AAV-Grn delivery to brain have shown moderate success in histopathologic and behavioral rescue in mouse FTD models. Here, we used AAV9 to deliver GRN to the lateral ventricle to achieve widespread expression in the Grn null mouse brain. We found that despite a global increase in progranulin throughout many brain regions, overexpression of GRN resulted in dramatic and selective hippocampal toxicity and degeneration affecting both neurons and glia. Histologically, hippocampal degeneration was preceded by T cell infiltration and perivascular cuffing, suggesting an inflammatory component to the ensuing neuronal loss. GRN delivery with an ependymal-targeting AAV for selective secretion of progranulin into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) similarly resulted in T cell infiltration as well as ependymal hypertrophy. Interestingly, overexpression of GRN in wild-type animals also provoked T cell infiltration. These results call into question the safety of GRN overexpression in the CNS, with evidence for both a region-selective immune response and cellular proliferative response following GRN gene delivery. Our results highlight the importance of careful consideration of target gene biology and cellular response to overexpression in relevant animal models prior to progressing to the clinic.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGene therapies using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors show great promise for many human diseases, including diseases that affect the central nervous system (CNS). Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) are neurodegenerative diseases resulting from loss of one or both copies of the gene encoding progranulin (GRN), and gene replacement has been proposed for these currently untreatable disorders. Here, we used two different AAV vectors to induce widespread brain GRN expression in mice lacking the gene, as well as in wild-type mice. Unexpectedly, GRN overexpression resulted in T cell infiltration, followed by marked hippocampal neurodegeneration. Our results call into question the safety of GRN overexpression in the CNS, with wider implications for development of CNS gene therapies.",
