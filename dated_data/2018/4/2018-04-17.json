    "abstract": "The DNA damage response is a signaling pathway found throughout biology. In many bacteria the DNA damage checkpoint is enforced by inducing expression of a small, membrane bound inhibitor that delays cell division providing time to repair damaged chromosomes. How cells sense successful DNA repair and promote checkpoint recovery is unknown. By using a high-throughput, forward genetic screen, we identified two unrelated proteases, YlbL and CtpA, that promote DNA damage checkpoint recovery in Bacillus subtilis. Deletion of both proteases leads to accumulation of the checkpoint protein YneA. DNA damage sensitivity and increased cell elongation in protease mutants depends on yneA. Further, expression of YneA in protease mutants was sufficient to inhibit cell proliferation. Finally, we show that one of the two proteases, CtpA, directly cleaves YneA in vitro. With these results, we report the mechanism for DNA damage checkpoint recovery in bacteria that use membrane bound cell division inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "RNA structures can interact with the ribosome to alter translational reading frame maintenance and promote recoding that result in alternative protein products. Here, we show that the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) from the dicistrovirus Cricket paralysis virus drives translation of the 0-frame viral polyprotein and an overlapping +1 open reading frame, called ORFx, via a novel mechanism whereby a subset of ribosomes recruited to the IRES bypasses downstream to resume translation at the +1-frame 13th non-AUG codon. A mutant of CrPV containing a stop codon in the +1 frame ORFx sequence, yet synonymous in the 0-frame, is attenuated compared to wild-type virus in a Drosophila infection model, indicating the importance of +1 ORFx expression in promoting viral pathogenesis. This work demonstrates a novel programmed IRES-mediated recoding strategy to increase viral coding capacity and impact virus infection, highlighting the diversity of RNA-driven translation initiation mechanisms in eukaryotes.",

However, the architecture has not been sufficiently investigated especially for pseudoknotted secondary structures.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to directly infer base-pairing probabilities with neural networks that does not depend on the architecture of RNA secondary structures, followed by performing the maximum expected accuracy (MEA) based decoding algorithms; Nussinov-style decoding for pseudoknot-free structures, and IPknot-style decoding for pseudoknotted structures. To train the neural networks connected to each base-pair, we adopt a max-margin framework, called structured support vector machines (SSVM), as the output layer. Our benchmarks for predicting RNA secondary structures with and without pseudoknots show that our algorithm achieves the best prediction accuracy compared with existing methods.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe source code is available at https://github.com/keio-bioinformatics/neuralfold/.\\n\\nContactsatoken@bio.keio.ac.jp",

    "abstract": "Replication stress poses a serious threat to genome and epigenome stability. Recombination-Dependent-Replication (RDR) ensures DNA synthesis resumption from arrested forks. Despite the identification of chromatin restoration pathways during DNA repair processes, crosstalk coupling RDR and chromatin assembly is largely unexplored. Here, we addressed the contribution of chromatin assembly to replication stress in fission yeast. We expressed a mutated histone (H3-H113D) to genetically impair replication-dependent chromatin assembly by destabilizing (H3-H4)2 tetramer. We established that DNA synthesis-dependent histone deposition is required for the completion of RDR. Histone deposition prevents joint-molecules from Rqh1-dependent disassembly, a crosstalk contributing to cell survival upon replication stress but channeling RDR towards deleterious events. Asf1 and CAF-1 act in RDR and CAF-1 recruitment to DNA synthesis associated to RDR requires the HR factor Rad52. Our data establish that CAF-1 counteracts Rqh1 activity at sites of replication stress by promoting repair synthesis-coupled histone deposition. These results demonstrate that histone deposition plays an active role in fine-tuning RDR, a benefit counterbalanced by stabilizing at-risk joint molecules for genome stability.",

Here we characterized cell line and primary cell models of HIV latency with single cell qPCR (sc-qPCR) for viral RNA (vRNA), and single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq). sc-qPCR revealed distinct populations of cells transcribing vRNA across a wide range of levels. Strikingly, scRNAseq of latently infected primary cells revealed a relationship between vRNA levels and the transcriptomic profiles within the population. Cells with the greatest level of HIV silencing expressed a specific set of host genes including markers of central memory T cells. By contrast, latently infected cells with higher levels of HIV transcription expressed markers of activated and effector T cells. These data reveal that heterogeneous behaviors of HIV proviruses within the latent reservoir are influenced by the host cell transcriptional program. Therapeutic modulation of these programs may reverse or enforce HIV latency.",

    "abstract": "Although most mammalian genes have multiple isoforms, an ongoing debate is whether these isoforms are all functional as well as the extent to which they increase the genomes functional repertoire. To ground this debate in data, we established a curation framework for evaluating experimental evidence of functionally distinct splice isoforms (FDSIs) and analyzed splice isoform function for over 700 human and mouse genes. Despite our bias towards prominently studied genes, we found experimental evidence meeting the classical definition for functionally distinct isoforms for only ~5% of the curated genes. If we relax our criteria, the fraction of genes with support for FDSIs remains low (~13%). We provide evidence that this picture will not change substantially with further curation. Furthermore, many FDSIs did not trace to a specific isoform in Ensembl. Our work has implications for computational analyses of alternative splicing and should help shape research around the role of splicing on gene function from presuming large general effects to acknowledging the need for stronger experimental evidence.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic process of memory consolidation involves a reorganization of brain regions that support a memory trace over time, but exactly how the network reorganizes as the memory changes remains unclear. We present novel converging evidence from studies of animals (rats) and humans for the time-dependent reorganization and transformation of different types of memory as measured both by behavior and brain activation. We find that context-specific memories in rats, and naturalistic episodic memories in humans, lose precision over time and activity in the hippocampus decreases. If, however, the retrieved memories retain contextual or perceptual detail, the hippocampus is engaged similarly at recent and remote timepoints. As the interval between the timepoint increases, the medial prefrontal cortex is engaged increasingly during memory retrieval, regardless of the context or the amount of retrieved detail. Moreover, these hippocampal-frontal shifts are accompanied by corresponding changes in a network of cortical structures mediating perceptually-detailed as well as less precise, schematic memories. These findings provide cross-species evidence for the crucial interplay between hippocampus and neocortex that reflects changes in memory representation over time and underlies systems consolidation.",

    "abstract": "The CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus are considered key for disambiguating sensory inputs from similar experiences in memory, a process termed pattern separation. The neural mechanisms underlying pattern separation, however, have been difficult to compare across species: rodents offer robust recording methods with less human-centric tasks while humans provide complex behavior with less recording potential. To overcome these limitations, we trained monkeys to perform a visual pattern separation task similar to those used in humans while recording activity from single CA3/DG neurons. We find that when animals discriminate recently seen novel images from similar (lure) images, behavior indicative of pattern separation, CA3/DG neurons respond to lure images more like novel than repeat images. Using a population of these neurons, we are able to classify novel, lure, and repeat images from each other using this pattern of firing rates. Notably, one subpopulation of these neurons is more responsible for distinguishing lures and repeats--the key discrimination indicative of pattern separation.",

The small heat-shock protein B-crystallin (BC) is associated with both, and directly inhibits amyloid formation in vitro and its toxicity in cells. Studying the mechanism of aggregation inhibition is challenging owing to sample heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of the process. Here, by means of NMR spectroscopy and chemical kinetics, we establish the mechanism by which the protein -lactalbumin aggregates and forms amyloid, and how this is inhibited by BC. In particular, we characterise the lifetime of the unstable aggregation nucleus, and determine that this species is specifically destabilised by BC. This mechanism allows the chaperone to delay the onset of aggregation, although it is overwhelmed on longer timescales. The methodology we present provides a mechanistic understanding of how BC reduces the toxicity of amyloids, and is widely applicable to other complex mixtures.",

However, individual cancer risk cannot currently be well quantified by analyzing germ line DNA. Most analyses of germline DNA focus on the additive effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found. Here we show that chromosomal-scale length variation of germline DNA can be used to predict whether a person will develop cancer. In two independent datasets, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project and the UK Biobank, we could classify whether or not a patient had a certain cancer based solely on chromosomal scale length variation. In the TCGA data, we found that all 32 different types of cancer could be predicted better than chance using chromosomal scale length variation data. We found a model that could predict ovarian cancer in women with an area under the receiver operator curve, AUC=0.89. In the UK Biobank data, we could predict breast cancer in women with an AUC=0.83. This method could be used to develop genetic risk scores for other conditions known to have a substantial genetic component and complements genetic risk scores derived from SNPs.",

    "abstract": "Small RNA-guided chromatin silencing, also referred to as nuclear RNAi, plays an essential role in genome surveillance in eukaryotes and provides a unique paradigm to explore the complexity in RNA-mediated chromatin regulation and transgenerational epigenetics. A well-recognized paradox in this research area is that transcription of the target loci is necessary for the initiation and maintenance of the silencing at the same loci. How the two opposing activities (transcriptional activation and repression) are coordinated during animal development is poorly understood. To resolve this gap, we took single-molecule RNA imaging, deep-sequencing, and genetic approaches towards delineating the developmental regulation and subcellular localization of RNA transcripts of two exemplary endogenous germline nuclear RNAi targets in C. elegans, Cer3 and Cer8 LTR retrotransposons. By examining the wild type and a collection of mutant strains, we found that transcription and silencing cycle of Cer3 and Cer8 is tightly coupled with the early embryogenesis and germline mitotic and meiotic cell cycles. Strikingly, Cer3 and Cer8 transcripts are exclusively localized in the nuclei of germ cells in both wild type and germline nuclear RNAi-defective mutant animals. RNA-sequencing analysis found that this nuclear enrichment feature is a general feature for the endogenous targets of the germline nuclear RNAi pathway. In addition, the germline and somatic repressions of Cer3 have different genetic requirement for the three H3K9 histone methyltransferases, MET-2, SET-25, and SET-32, in conjunction with the nuclear Argonaute protein WAGO-9/HRDE-1. These results provide a first comprehensive cellular and developmental characterization of the nuclear RNAi-targeted endogenous targets throughout animal reproductive cycle. Altogether, these results support a model in which (1) both the transcriptional activation and repression steps of the germline nuclear RNAi pathway are tightly coupled with animal development, (2) the endogenous targets exhibit a hallmark of nuclear enrichment of their transcripts, and (3) different heterochromatin enzymes play distinct roles in somatic and germline silencing of the endogenous targets.",
