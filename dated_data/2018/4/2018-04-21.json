    "abstract": "BackgroundOne explanation for the persistence of schizophrenia despite the reduced fertility of patients is that it is a by-product of recent human evolution. This hypothesis is supported by evidence suggesting that recently-evolved genomic regions in humans are involved in the genetic risk for schizophrenia. Using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of schizophrenia and 11 other phenotypes, we tested for enrichment of association with GWAS traits in regions that have undergone methylation changes in the human lineage compared to Neanderthals and Denisovans, i.e. human-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We used analytical tools that evaluate polygenic enrichment of a subset of genomic variants against all variants.\\n\\nResultsSchizophrenia was the only trait in which DMR SNPs showed clear enrichment of association that passed the genome-wide significance threshold. The enrichment was not observed for Neanderthal or Denisovan DMRs. The enrichment seen in human DMRs is comparable to that for genomic regions tagged by Neanderthal Selective Sweep markers, and stronger than that for Human Accelerated Regions. The enrichment survives multiple testing performed through permutation (n=10,000) and bootstrapping (n=5,000) in INRICH (p<0.01). Some enrichment of association with height was observed at the gene level.\\n\\nConclusionsRegions where DNA methylation modifications have changed during recent human evolution show enrichment of association with schizophrenia and possibly with height. Our study further supports the hypothesis that genetic variants conferring risk of schizophrenia co-occur in genomic regions that have changed as the human species evolved. Since methylation is an epigenetic mark, potentially mediated by environmental changes, our results also suggest that interaction with the environment might have contributed to that association.",

Then, clinical data elements in the models were pulled from clinical data and transformed to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model; genetic data elements were added based on population rates. A hybrid Bayesian network was used to create synthetic data from the logical elements of the risk scores and the underlying population frequencies of the clinical data.\\n\\nResultsA synthetic dataset of 446,000 patients was created. A two-day curriculum was created based on this synthetic data with exploratory data analysis and machine learning components. The curriculum was offered on two separate occasions; the two groups of learners were given the curriculum and data, and results were tallied, summarized, and compared. Students ability to complete the challenge was mixed; more experienced students achieved a range of 70%-85% in balanced accuracy, but many others did not perform better than the baseline model.\\n\\nDiscussionOverall, students enjoyed the course and dataset, but some struggled to consistently apply machine learning techniques. The curriculum, data set, techniques for generation, and results are available for others to use for their own training.\\n\\nConclusionA realistic synthetic data with clinical and genetic components helps students learn issues in cardiovascular risk scoring, practice data science skills, and compete in a challenge to improve identification of risk.",

    "abstract": "During terminal erythropoiesis, the splicing machinery in differentiating erythroblasts executes a robust intron retention (IR) program that impacts expression of hundreds of genes. We studied IR mechanisms in the SF3B1 splicing factor gene, which expresses ~50% of its transcripts in late erythroblasts as a nuclear isoform that retains intron 4. RNA-seq analysis of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)-inhibited cells revealed previously undescribed splice junctions, rare or not detected in normal cells, that connect constitutive exons 4 and 5 to highly conserved cryptic cassette exons within the intron. Minigene splicing reporter assays showed that these cassettes promote IR. Genome-wide analysis of splice junction reads demonstrated that cryptic noncoding cassettes are much more common in large (>1kb) retained introns than they are in small retained introns or in non-retained introns. Functional assays showed that heterologous cassettes can promote retention of intron 4 in the SF3B1 splicing reporter. Although many of these cryptic exons were spliced inefficiently, they exhibited substantial binding of U2AF1 and U2AF2 adjacent to their splice acceptor sites. We propose that these exons function as decoys that engage the intron-terminal splice sites, blocking cross-intron interactions required for excision. Developmental regulation of decoy function underlies a major component of the erythroblast IR program.",

    "abstract": "Winchester syndrome (WS, MIM #277950) is an extremely rare autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia characterized by progressive joint destruction and osteolysis. To date, only one missense mutation in MMP14, encoding the membrane-bound matrix metalloprotease 14, has been reported in WS patients. Here, we report a novel hypomorphic MMP14 p.Arg111His (R111H) allele, associated with a mitigated form of WS. Functional analysis demonstrated that this mutation, in contrast to previously reported human and murine MMP14 mutations, does not affect MMP14s transport to the cell membrane. Instead, it partially impairs MMP14s proteolytic activity. This residual activity likely accounts for the mitigated phenotype observed in our patients. Based on our observations as well as previously published data, we hypothesize that MMP14s catalytic activity is the prime determinant of disease severity. Given the limitations of our in vitro assays in addressing the consequences of MMP14 dysfunction, we generated a novel mmp14a/b knockout zebrafish model. The fish accurately reflected key aspects of the WS phenotype including craniofacial malformations, kyphosis, short-stature and reduced bone density due to defective collagen remodeling. Notably, the zebrafish model will be a valuable tool for developing novel therapeutic approaches to a devastating bone disorder.",

In this study, we apply computational tools to The Cancer Genome Atlas and other datasets to define how virus infection shapes the tumor microenvironment and genetic architecture of 6 virus-associated tumor types. Across cancers, the cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment varied based on viral status, with infected tumors often exhibiting increased infiltration of cytolytic cell types. Analyses of the infiltrating T cell receptor repertoire revealed that Epstein-Barr virus was associated with decreased diversity in multiple cancers, suggesting an antigen-driven immune response. Tissue-specific gene expression signatures capturing these virus-induced transcriptomic changes successfully predicted virus status in independent datasets and were associated with both immune- and proliferation-related features that were predictive of prognosis. The analyses presented suggest viruses have distinct effects in different tumors with implications for immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "In bioinformatics, as well as other computationally-intensive research fields, there is a need for workflows that can reliably produce consistent output, independent of the software environment or configuration settings of the machine on which they are executed. Indeed, this is essential for controlled comparison between different observations or for the wider dissemination of workflows. Providing this type of reproducibility, however, is often complicated by the need to accommodate the myriad dependencies included in a larger body of software, each of which generally come in various versions. Moreover, in many fields (bioinformatics being a prime example), these versions are subject to continual change due to rapidly evolving technologies, further complicating problems related to reproducibility. Here, we propose a principled approach for building analysis pipelines and managing their dependencies. As a case study to demonstrate the utility of our approach, we present a set of highly reproducible pipelines for the analysis of RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, Bisulfite-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq. All pipelines process raw experimental data, and generate reports containing publication-ready plots and figures, with interactive report elements and standard observables. Users may install these highly reproducible packages and apply them to their own datasets without any special computational expertise beyond the use of the command line. We hope such a toolkit will provide immediate benefit to laboratory workers wishing to process their own data sets or bioinformaticians seeking to automate all, or parts of, their analyses. In the long term, we hope our approach to reproducibility will serve as a blueprint for reproducible workflows in other areas.

    "abstract": "Abstract.To support the assessments of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the IPBES Expert Group on Scenarios and Models is carrying out an intercomparison of biodiversity and ecosystem services models using harmonized scenarios (BES-SIM). The goals of BES-SIM are (1) to project the global impacts of land use and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services (i.e. natures contributions to people) over the coming decades, compared to the 20th century, using a set of common metrics at multiple scales, and (2) to identify model uncertainties and research gaps through the comparisons of projected biodiversity and ecosystem services across models. BES-SIM uses three scenarios combining specific Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to explore a wide range of land-use change and climate change futures. This paper describes the rationale for scenarios selection, the process of harmonizing input data for land use, based on the second phase of the Land Use Harmonization Project (LUH2), and climate, the biodiversity and ecosystem service models used, the core simulations carried out, the harmonization of the model output metrics, and the treatment of uncertainty. The results of this collaborative modelling project will support the ongoing global assessment of IPBES, strengthen ties between IPBES and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios and modelling processes, advise the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) on its development of a post-2020 strategic plans and conservation goals, and inform the development of a new generation of nature-centred scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Diversity is a marker of ecosystem health in ecology, microbiology and immunology, with implications for disease diagnosis and infection resistance. However, accurately comparing diversity across environmental gradients is challenging, especially when number of different taxonomic groups in the community is large. Furthermore, existing approaches to estimating diversity do not perform well when the taxonomic groups in the community interact via an ecological network, such as by competing within their niche, or with mutualistic relationships. To address this, we propose DivNet, a method for estimating within- and between-community diversity in ecosystems where taxa interact via an ecological network. In particular, accounting for network structure permits more accurate estimates of alpha- and beta-diversity, even in settings with a large number of taxa and a small number of samples. DivNet is fast, accurate, precise, performs well with large numbers of taxa, and is robust to both weakly and strongly networked communities. We show that the advantages of incorporating taxon interactions into diversity estimation are especially clear in analyzing microbiomes and other high-diversity, strongly networked ecosystems. Therefore, to illustrate the method, we analyze the microbiome of seafloor basalts based on a 16S amplicon sequencing dataset with 1490 taxa and 13 samples.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSequencing studies across multiple cancers continue to reveal the spectrum of mutations and genes involved in the pathobiology of these cancers. Exome sequencing of oral cancers, a subset of Head and Neck Squamous cell Carcinomas (HNSCs) common among tobacco-chewing populations, revealed that ~34% of the affected patients harbor mutations in the CASP8 gene. Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC) is another cancer type where about 10% cases harbor CASP8 mutations. Caspase-8, the protease encoded by CASP8 gene, plays a dual role in programmed cell death, which in turn has an important role in tumor cell death and drug resistance. CASP8 is a protease required for the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis and is also a negative regulator of necroptosis. Using bioinformatics approaches to mine data in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we compared the molecular features and survival of these carcinomas with and without CASP8 mutations.\\n\\nResultsOur in silico analyses showed that HNSCs with CASP8 mutations displayed a prominent signature of genes involved in immune response and inflammation, and were rich in immune cell infiltrates. However, in contrast to Human Papilloma Virus-positive HNSCs, a subtype that exhibits high immune cell infiltration and better overall survival, HNSC patients with mutant-CASP8 tumors did not display any survival advantage. A similar bioinformatic analyses in UCECs revealed that while UCECs with CASP8 mutations also displayed an immune signature, they had better overall survival, in contrast to the HNSC scenario. On further examination, we found that there was significant up-regulation of neutrophils as well as the cytokine, IL33 in mutant-CASP8 HNSCs, both of which were not observed in mutant-CASP8 UCECs.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results suggested that carcinomas with mutant CASP8 have broadly similar immune signatures albeit with different effects on survival. We hypothesize that subtle tissue-dependent differences could influence survival by modifying the micro-environment of mutant-CASP8 carcinomas. High neutrophil numbers, which is a well-known negative prognosticator in HNSCs, and/or high IL33 levels may be some of the factors affecting survival of mutant-CASP8 cases.",

The impacts of evolutionary factors, such as genetic variation, on the invasion process are increasingly appreciated but there remain gaps in the empirical literature. The adaptive potential of populations can be quantified using genetic variance-covariance matrices (G), which encapsulate the heritable genetic variance in a population. Here, we use a multivariate, Bayesian approach to assess the adaptive potential of introduced populations of ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, a serious allergen and agricultural weed. We compared several aspects of genetic architecture and the structure of G matrices between three native and three introduced populations, based on data collected in the field in a common garden experiment. We find moderate differences in the quantitative genetic architecture among populations, but we do not find that introduced populations suffer from a limited adaptive potential compared to native populations. Ragweed has an annual life history, is an obligate outcrosser, and produces billions of seeds and pollen grains per. These characteristics, combined with the significant additive genetic variance documented here, suggest ragweed will be able to respond quickly to selection pressures in both its native and introduced ranges.",

    "abstract": "The ankyrin 3 gene (ANK3) is a well-established risk gene for psychiatric illness, but the mechanisms underlying its pathophysiology remain elusive. We examined the molecular effects of disrupting brain-specific Ank3 isoforms in mouse and neuronal model systems. RNA sequencing of hippocampus from Ank3+/- and Ank3+/+ mice identified altered expression of 282 genes that were enriched for microtubule-related functions. Results were supported by increased expression of microtubule end-binding protein 3 (EB3), an indicator of microtubule dynamics, in Ank3+/- mouse hippocampus. Live-cell imaging of EB3 movement in primary neurons from Ank3+/- mice revealed impaired elongation of microtubules. Using a CRISPR-dCas9-KRAB transcriptional repressor in mouse neuro-2a cells, we determined that repression of brain-specific Ank3 increased EB3 expression, decreased tubulin acetylation, and increased the soluble:polymerized tubulin ratio, indicating enhanced microtubule dynamics. These changes were rescued by inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) with lithium or CHIR99021, a highly selective GSK3 inhibitor. Brain-specific Ank3 repression in neuro-2a cells increased GSK3 activity (reduced inhibitory phosphorylation) and elevated collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) phosphorylation, a known GSK3 substrate and microtubule-binding protein. Pharmacological inhibition of CRMP2 activity attenuated the rescue of EB3 expression and tubulin polymerization in Ank3 repressed cells by lithium or CHIR99021, suggesting microtubule instability induced by Ank3 repression is dependent on CRMP2 activity. Taken together, our data indicate that aNK3 functions in neuronal microtubule dynamics through GSK3 and its downstream substrate CRMP2. These findings reveal cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying brain-specific ANK3 disruption that may be related to its role in psychiatric illness.",

Recent live imaging of hunchback promoter dynamics shows a stable steep binary expression pattern established within the three minute interphase of nuclear cycle 11. Considering expression models of different complexity, we explore the trade-o between the ability of a regulatory system to produce a steep boundary and minimize expression variability between different nuclei. We show how a limited readout time imposed by short developmental cycles affects the genes ability to read positional information along the embryos anterior posterior axis and express reliably. Comparing our theoretical results to real-time monitoring of the hunchback transcription dynamics in live flies, we discuss possible regulatory strategies, suggesting an important role for additional binding sites, gradients or non-equilibrium binding and modified transcription factor search strategies.",

    "abstract": "The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures accurate chromosome segregation by delaying anaphase onset in response to unattached kinetochores. Anaphase is delayed by the generation of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) composed of the checkpoint proteins Mad2 and BubR1/Bub3 bound to the protein Cdc20. Current models assume that MCC production is catalyzed at unattached kinetochores and that the Mad1/Mad2 complex is instrumental in the conversion of Mad2 from an open form (O-Mad2) to a closed form (C-Mad2) that can bind to Cdc20. Importantly the levels of Mad2 at kinetochores correlate with SAC activity but whether C-Mad2 at kinetochores exclusively represents its complex with Mad1 is not fully established. Here we use a recently established C-Mad2 specific monoclonal antibody to show that Cdc20 and C-Mad2 levels correlate at kinetochores and that depletion of Cdc20 reduces Mad2 but not Mad1 kinetochore levels. Importantly reintroducing wild type Cdc20 but not Cdc20 R132A, a mutant form that cannot bind Mad2, restores Mad2 levels. In agreement with this live cell imaging of fluorescent tagged Mad2 reveals that Cdc20 depletion strongly reduces Mad2 localization to kinetochores. These results support the presence of Mad2-Cdc20 complexes at kinetochores in agreement with current models of the SAC but also argue that Mad2 levels at kinetochores cannot be used as a direct readout of Mad1 levels.",

This has its origin in the variation between the exomes of the two, which provides the basis for minor histocompatibility antigens (mHA). The mHA presented on the HLA class I and II molecules and the ensuing T cell response to these antigens results in graft versus host disease. In this paper, results of a whole exome sequencing study are presented, with resulting alloreactive polymorphic peptides and their HLA class I and HLA class II (DRB1) binding affinity quantified. Large libraries of potentially alloreactive recipient peptides binding both sets of molecules were identified, with HLA-DRB1 presenting an order of magnitude greater number of peptides. These results are used to develop a quantitative framework to understand the immunobiology of transplantation. A tensor-based approach is used to derive the equations needed to determine the alloreactive donor T cell response from the mHA-HLA binding affinity and protein expression data. This approach may be used in future studies to simulate the magnitude of expected donor T cell response and risk for alloreactive complications in HLA matched or mismatched hematopoietic cell and solid organ transplantation.",

A detailed profile of this perceptual decision making, however, has not yet been verified. Using a coherence-varying motion discrimination task, we precisely measured the perceptual decision kernel of subjects. We observed that the kernel size (decision time) is consistent within subjects, independent of stimulus dynamics, and the observed kernel could accurately predict each subject performance. Interestingly, the performance of most subjects was optimized when stimulus duration was matched to their kernel size. We also found that the observed kernel size was strongly correlated with the perceptual alternation in bistable conditions. Our result suggests that the observed decision kernel reveals a subject-specific feature of sensory integration.",

    "abstract": "The ability to interact with our environment requires the brain to transform spatially-represented sensory signals into temporally-encoded motor commands for appropriate control of the relevant effectors. For visually-guided eye movements, or saccades, the superior colliculus (SC) is assumed to be the final stage of spatial representation, and instantaneous control of the movement is achieved through a rate code representation in the lower brain stem. We questioned this dogma and investigated whether SC activity also employs a dynamic rate code, in addition to the spatial representation. Noting that the kinematics of repeated movements exhibits trial-to-trial variability, we regressed instantaneous SC activity with instantaneous eye velocity and found a robust correlation throughout saccade duration. Peak correlation was tightly linked to time of peak velocity, and SC neurons with higher firing rates exhibited stronger correlations. Moreover, the strong correlative relationship was preserved when eye movement profiles were substantially altered by a blink-induced perturbation. These results indicate that the rate code of individual SC neurons can control instantaneous eye velocity, similar to how primary motor cortex controls hand movements, and argue against a serial process for transforming spatially encoded information into a rate code.",

Using automated homecage training and a novel forelimb sensor, we trained freely-moving mice to initiate forelimb sequences with clearly resolved submillimeter-scale micromovements followed by millimeter-scale reaches to learned spatial targets. Hundreds of thousands of trajectories were decomposed into millions of kinematic primitives, while closed-loop photoinhibition was used to test roles of motor cortical areas. Inactivation of contralateral motor cortex reduced primitive peak speed but, surprisingly, did not substantially affect primitive direction, initiation, termination, or complexity, resulting in isomorphic, spatially contracted trajectories that undershot targets. Our findings demonstrate separable loss of a single kinematic parameter, speed, and identify conditions where loss of cortical drive reduces the gain of motor primitives but does not affect their generation, timing or direction. The combination of high precision forelimb sensing with automated training and neural manipulation provides a system for studying how motor sequences are constructed from elemental building blocks.",

    "abstract": "Episodic memories hinge upon our ability to process a wide range of multisensory information and bind this information into a coherent, memorable representation. On a neural level, these two processes are thought to be supported by neocortical alpha/beta desynchronisation and hippocampal theta/gamma synchronisation, respectively. Intuitively, these two processes should couple to successfully create and retrieve episodic memories, yet this hypothesis has not been tested empirically. We address this by analysing human intracranial EEG data recorded during two associative memory tasks. We find that neocortical alpha/beta (8-20Hz) power decreases reliably precede and predict hippocampal \\\"fast\\\" gamma (60-80Hz) power increases during episodic memory formation; during episodic memory retrieval however, hippocampal \\\"slow\\\" gamma (40-50Hz) power increases reliably precede and predict later neocortical alpha/beta power decreases. We speculate that this coupling reflects the flow of information from neocortex to hippocampus during memory formation, and hippocampal pattern completion inducing information reinstatement in the neocortex during memory retrieval.\\n\\nSignificance StatementEpisodic memories detail our personally-experienced past. The formation and retrieval of these memories has long been thought to be supported by a division of labour between the neocortex and the hippocampus, where the former processes event-related information and the latter binds this information together. However, it remains unclear how the two regions interact. We uncover directional coupling between these regions, with power decreases in the neocortex that precede and predict power increases in the hippocampus during memory formation. Fascinatingly, this process reverses during memory retrieval, with hippocampal power increases preceding and predicting neocortical power decreases. These results suggest a bidirectional flow of information between the neocortex and hippocampus is fundamental to the formation and retrieval of episodic memories.",

Genetic atlases reveal pervasive pleiotropy, and genome-wide significant loci are often shared across different phenotypes. We introduce genomic structural equation modeling (Genomic SEM), a multivariate method for analyzing the joint genetic architectures of complex traits. Using formal methods for modeling covariance structure, Genomic SEM synthesizes genetic correlations and SNP-heritabilities inferred from GWAS summary statistics of individual traits from samples with varying and unknown degrees of overlap. Genomic SEM can be used to identify variants with effects on general dimensions of cross-trait liability, boost power for discovery, and calculate more predictive polygenic scores. Finally, Genomic SEM can be used to identify loci that cause divergence between traits, aiding the search for what uniquely differentiates highly correlated phenotypes. We demonstrate several applications of Genomic SEM, including a joint analysis of GWAS summary statistics from five genetically correlated psychiatric traits. We identify 27 independent SNPs not previously identified in the univariate GWASs, 5 of which have been reported in other published GWASs of the included traits. Polygenic scores derived from Genomic SEM consistently outperform polygenic scores derived from GWASs of the individual traits. Genomic SEM is flexible, open ended, and allows for continuous innovations in how multivariate genetic architecture is modeled.",

AMR surveillance is a key element in understanding the implications resulting from the use of antibiotics for therapeutic as well as prophylactic needs.

This surveillance study reports the trend and pattern of AMR detected in Vibrio species isolated from molluscs harvested in Canada, between 2006 and 2012, against 19 commonly used antibiotics. Five common antibiotics, ampicillin, cephalothin, erythromycin, kanamycin and streptomycin, predominantly contributed to AMR including multi-drug resistance (MDR) in the molluscan Vibrio spp. isolated in 2006. A prospective follow-up analysis of these drugs showed a declining trend in the frequency of MDR/AMR-Vibrio spp. in subsequent years until 2012. The observed decline appears to have been influenced by the specific downturn in resistance to the aminoglycosides, kanamycin and streptomycin. Frequently observed MDR/AMR-Vibrio spp. in seafood is a potential health concern associated with seafood consumption. Our surveillance study provided an indication of the antibiotics that challenged the marine bacteria, sourced to Canadian estuaries, during and/or prior to the study period.",

    "abstract": "Genome reduction is pervasive among maternally-inherited bacterial endosymbionts. This genome reduction can eventually lead to serious deterioration of essential metabolic pathways, thus rendering an obligate endosymbiont unable to provide essential nutrients to its host. This loss of essential pathways can lead to either symbiont complementation (sharing of the nutrient production with a novel co-obligate symbiont) or symbiont replacement (complete takeover of nutrient production by the novel symbiont). However, the process by which these two evolutionary events happen remains somewhat enigmatic by the lack of examples of intermediate stages of this process. Cinara aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) typically harbour two obligate bacterial symbionts: Buchnera and Serratia symbiotica. However, the latter has been replaced by different bacterial taxa in specific lineages, and thus species within this aphid lineage could provide important clues into the process of symbiont replacement. In the present study, using 16S rRNA high-throughput amplicon sequencing, we determined that the aphid Cinara strobi harbours not two, but three fixed bacterial symbionts: Buchnera aphidicola, a Sodalis sp., and S. symbiotica. Through genome assembly and genome-based metabolic inference, we have found that only the first two symbionts (Buchnera and Sodalis) actually contribute to the hosts supply of essential nutrients while S. symbiotica has become unable to contribute towards this task. We found that S. symbiotica has a rather large and highly eroded genome which codes only for a few proteins and displays extensive pseudogenisation. Thus, we propose an ongoing symbiont replacement within C. strobi, in which a once   competent\\\" S. symbiotica does no longer contribute towards the beneficial association. These results suggest that in dual symbiotic systems, when a substitute co-symbiont is available, genome deterioration can precede genome reduction and a symbiont can be maintained despite the apparent lack of benefit to its host.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcal Superantigen-Like (SSL) proteins, one of major virulence factor families produced by Staphylococcus aureus, were previously demonstrated to be immune evasion molecules that interfere with a variety of innate immune defenses. However, in contrast to these characterized SSLs, that inhibit immune functions, we show that SSL13 is a strong activator of neutrophils via the formyl-peptide receptor 2 (FPR2). Moreover, our data show that SSL13 acts as a chemoattractant, induces degranulation and oxidative burst in neutrophils. As with many other staphylococcal immune evasion proteins, SSL13 shows a high degree of human specificity. SSL13 is not able to efficiently activate mouse neutrophils, hampering in vivo experiments.\\n\\nIn conclusion, SSL13 is a neutrophil chemoattractant and activator that acts via the FPR2. Therefore, SSL13 is a unique SSL member that does not belong to the immune evasion class, but is a pathogen alarming molecule.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis (BCO) is a major cause of lameness in broiler chicken, and results in serious economic losses worldwide. Although the pathogenesis mechanism leading to lameness is not entirely understood, some strains of Enterococcus sp., avian pathogenic Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus aureus have been long recognized as important causative pathogens. To prevent the progression of Enterococcus sp., avian pathogenic E. coli, or S. aureus infections, we developed rapid, sensitive, and convenient diagnostic assays using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Entero-Common-LAMP assays were developed for a simultaneous detection of eight Enterococcus species. To target specific microorganisms, seven Entero-Specific-LAMP assays for E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. hirae, E. gallinarum, E. avium, E. durans and E. cecorum, and E. coli-LAMP and S. aureus-LAMP assays, were developed. Considering the prevalence and economic impact of Enterococcus sp., E. coli, and S. aureus, the developed ten different LAMP assays have a considerable potential as routine diagnostic methods in the field or in resource-limited environments.",

    "abstract": "Megabase-scale somatic copy number variants (CNVs) alter allelic diversity in a subset of human neocortical neurons. Reported frequencies of CNV neurons range from [~]5% of neurons in some individuals to greater than 30% in other individuals. Genome-wide and familial studies implicitly assume a constant brain genome when assessing the genetic risk architecture of neurological disease, thus it is critical to determine whether divergent reports of CNV neuron frequency reflect normal individual variation or technical differences between approaches. We generated a new dataset of over 800 human neurons from 5 neurotypical individuals and developed a computational approach that measures single cell library quality based on Bayesian Information Criterion and identifies integer-like variant segments from population-level statistics. A brain CNV atlas was assembled using our new dataset and published data from 10 additional neurotypical individuals. This atlas reveals that the frequency of neocortical CNV neurons varies widely among individuals, but that this variability is not readily accounted for by tissue quality or CNV detection approach. Rather, the age of the individual is anti-correlated with CNV neuron frequency. Fewer CNV neurons are observed in aged individuals than young individuals.",

Gromacs is an open source software and widely used in molecular dynamics simulation of biological molecules such as proteins, and nucleic acids (DNA AND RNA-molecules). We employ the CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) program for the force fields which enable the potential energy of a molecular system to be calculated rapidly. In this particular simple molecular mechanics interaction fields (CHARMM), the force fields consists of stretching energy, bending energy and torsion energy. The non-bond interaction energy is modeled by Lennard-Jones potential. The pdb2gmx gromacs command is implemented to obtained the basic coordinate file and topology for the particular system from the GFP PDB file (1gfl.pdb). We enclosed water molecule in a rhombic dodecahedron box having size 0.5nm, and protein are embedded in solvent water. The steepest descent method (first-order minimization) are implemented to calculate the local energy minimum with 104-steps. The stability of protein with solvent water molecule are analyzed by measuring the root-mean square displacement (RMSD) of all atoms. It was shown with help of figure that RMSD initially increases rapidly in the first part of simulation, but become stable around 0.14nm, roughly the resolution of the X-ray structure. The difference is partly due to the moving and vibration of atoms around an equilibrium structure. Secondary structure of GFP protein is presented with the help of DSSP-program.",

    "abstract": "Suppressed recombination in chromosomal inversion heterozygotes is a well-known but poorly understood phenomenon. Recombination suppression is the result of at least four different regional effects of inversion heterozygosity; surprisingly, this includes areas outside inversions where there are no barriers to normal pairing, synapsis, double strand break formation, or recovery of crossover products. The interference hypothesis of recombination suppression proposes heterozygous inversion breakpoints possess chiasma-like properties such that recombination suppression extends from breakpoints in a process analogous to crossover interference. This hypothesis is qualitatively consistent with chromosome-wide patterns of recombination suppression, unifying the various regional effects under a single mechanism. The present study generates quantitative predictions for this hypothesis using a probabilistic model of crossover interference as a stationary renewal point process with gamma-distributed interarrival distances. These predictions were tested with formal genetic data (>40,000 meioses) on crossing-over in intervals external and adjacent to four cosmopolitan inversions of Drosophila melanogaster. The decay of recombination suppression differs for each of the four cosmopolitan inversions, with a strong dependence on proximity to the centromere. Counterintuitively, greater than expected recombination was observed in centromeric regions for the most proximally placed inversions. Structural features of chromosomes are discussed as potentially confounding variables in modelling recombination suppression. The true form of the decay function is not currently known and will require high-resolution mapping of rare crossover events in regions immediately adjacent to inversion breakpoints. A simple extension of the present experimental system can be conducted as a genetic screen for those rare crossover events.",

Activation of fetal T cells is associated with fetal inflammation and the termination of pregnancy, yet which fetal T cells contribute to this process is poorly understood. Here we show a transcriptionally distinct population of pro-inflammatory T cells that predominates in the human fetal intestine. Activation of PLZF+ T cells results in rapid production of Th1 cytokines and is inhibited upon ligation of surface CD161. This mechanism of fetal immune suppression may inform how immune dysregulation could result in fetal and neonatal inflammatory pathologies such as preterm birth. Our data support that human development of protective adaptive immunity originates in utero within the specialized microenvironment of the fetal intestine.",

The underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we probe the activity of DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system with single-molecule protein refolding assay using tandem repeats of titin immunoglobulin 27 (I27)8. We provide direct evidence that DnaK in apo- and ADP-bound state is predominantly a holdase, which kinetically stabilizes the polyprotein in its unfolded form. Binding of ATP relieves DnaKs holding, allowing protein refolding. The presence of co-chaperone DnaJ and GrpE modulates this holding-release switching, possibly by altering DnaKs nucleotide state.

    "abstract": "Rhizobium etli CE3 grown in succinate-ammonium minimal medium (MM) excreted outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) with diameters of 40 to 100 nm. Proteins from the OMVs and the periplasmic space were isolated from 6 and 24 h cultures and identified by proteome analysis. A total 770 proteins were identified: 73.8 and 21.3 % of these proteins occurred only in the periplasm and OMVs, respectively, and only 4.9 % were found in both locations. The majority of proteins found in either location were present only at 6 or 24 h: in the periplasm and OMVs, only 24 and 9 % of proteins, respectively, were present at both sampling times, indicating a time-dependent differential sorting of proteins into the two compartments. The OMVs contained proteins with physiologically varied roles, including Rhizobium adhering proteins (Rap), polysaccharidases, polysaccharide export proteins, autoaggregation and adherence proteins, glycosyl transferases, peptidoglycan binding and cross-linking enzymes, potential cell wall modifying enzymes, porins, multidrug efflux RND family proteins, ABC transporter proteins, and heat shock proteins. As expected, proteins with known periplasmic localizations (phosphatases, phosphodiesterases, pyrophosphatases) were found only in the periplasm, along with numerous proteins involved in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism and transport. Nearly one-quarter of the proteins present in the OMVs were also found in our previous analysis of the R. etli total exproteome of MM-grown cells, indicating that these nanoparticles are an important mechanism for protein excretion in this species.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia by rhizobia symbiotically associated with legumes is of major importance in sustainable agricultural. Rhizobia excrete a variety of symbiotically important proteins using canonical secretion systems. In this work, we show that Rhizobium etli grown in culture also excretes proteins in membrane-enclosed structures called outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). This study reports OMV production by rhizobia. Proteins identified in the OMVs included Rhizobium adhering (Rap) and autoaggregation proteins, polysaccharidases, RTX toxins, porins and multidrug efflux proteins. Some of these proteins have important roles in the R. etli-common bean symbiosis, and their packaging into OMVs could deliver them to the environment in a concentrated yet diffusible form protected from degradation. The work described here provides a basis for future studies on the function of rhizobial OMVs in free life and symbiosis.",

    "abstract": "The 2015-16 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas and the Caribbean demonstrates that clinical assays to detect, distinguish, and characterize immune responses to flaviviral infections are needed. ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV) are mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses sharing overlapping geographical distribution and have significant sequence similarity that can increase the potential for antibody and T cell cross-reaction. Using nonstructural protein 1-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), we determine the serostatus of individuals living in a DENV- and ZIKV-endemic region in Brazil, identifying individuals with primary DENV (pDENV) and ZIKV (pZIKV), ZIKV with primary DENV (ZIKVwpDENV), and secondary DENV (sDENV) infections; pDENV and pZIKV were further confirmed by neutralization tests. Development of an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay for DENV and ZIKV structural and nonstructural (NS) protein antigens enables us to distinguish infections by these viruses based on T cells and to characterize those responses. We find that IFN-{gamma} and TNF- T cell responses to NS3 differentiates DENV and ZIKV infections with 94% sensitivity and 92% specificity. In general, we also show that pDENV and sDENV cases and pZIKV and ZIKVwpDENV cases elicit similar T cell response patterns, and that HIV-infected individuals have T cell responses that are lower in magnitude compared to HIV-negative individuals. These results have important implications for DENV and ZIKV diagnostic and vaccine development and provide critical insights into the T cell response in individuals with multiple flaviviral infections.",

    "abstract": "Geminiviruses are DNA viruses that replicate in nuclei of infected plant cells using the plant DNA replication machinery, including PCNA (Proliferating cellular nuclear antigen), a cofactor that orchestrates genome duplication and maintenance by recruiting crucial players to replication forks. These viruses encode a multifunctional protein, Rep, which is essential for viral replication, induces the accumulation of the host replication machinery and interacts with several host proteins, including PCNA and the SUMO E2 conjugation enzyme (SCE1). Post-translational modification of PCNA by ubiquitin or SUMO plays an essential role in the switching of PCNA between interacting partners during DNA metabolism processes (e.g. replication, recombination, repair, etc.). In yeast, PCNA sumoylation has been associated to DNA repair involving homologous recombination (HR). Previously, we reported that ectopic Rep expression results in very specific changes in the sumoylation pattern of plant cells. In this work, we show, using a reconstituted sumoylation system in Escherichia coli, that tomato PCNA is sumoylated at two residues, K254 and K164, and that co-expression of the geminivirus protein Rep suppresses sumoylation at these lysines. Finally, we confirm that PCNA is sumoylated in planta and that Rep also interferes with PCNA sumoylation in plant cells.\\n\\nImportanceSUMO adducts have a key role in regulating the activity of animal and yeast PCNA on DNA repair and replication. Our work demonstrates for the first time that sumoylation of plant PCNA occurs in plant cells and that a plant virus interferes with this modification. This work marks the importance of sumoylation in allowing viral infection and replication in plants. Moreover, it constitutes a prime example of viral proteins interfering with post-translational modifications of selected host factors to create a proper environment for infection.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes and obesity have been associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we use optically transparent zebrafish to visualize liver inflammation and disease progression in a NAFLD/NASH-HCC model. We combined a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) with a transgenic zebrafish HCC model induced by hepatocyte-specific activated {beta}-catenin and found that diet induced an increase in liver size and enhanced angiogenesis and neutrophil infiltration in the liver. Although macrophage number was not affected by diet, HCD induced changes in macrophage morphology and polarization with an increase in liver associated TNF-positive macrophages. Treatment with metformin altered macrophage polarization and reduced liver size in NAFLD/NASH-associated HCC larvae. Moreover, ablation of macrophages limited progression in NAFLD/NASH-associated HCC larvae but not in HCC alone. These findings suggest that HCD alters macrophage polarization and exacerbates the liver inflammatory microenvironment and cancer progression in a zebrafish model of NAFLD/NASH-associated HCC.",

    "abstract": "Networks of co-expressed genes produce complex phenotypes associated with functional novelty. Sex differences in gene expression levels or in the structure of gene co-expression networks can cause sexual dimorphism and may resolve sexually antagonistic selection. Here we used RNA-sequencing in the paleopolyploid salmonid Brook Charr Salvelinus fontinalis to characterize sex-specific co-expression networks in the liver of 35 female and 51 male offspring. In both networks, modules were characterized for functional enrichment, hub gene identification, and associations with 15 growth, reproduction, and stress-related phenotypes. Modules were then evaluated for preservation in the opposite sex, and in the congener Arctic Charr Salvelinus alpinus. Overall, more transcripts were assigned to a module in the female network than in the male network, which coincided with higher inter-individual gene expression and phenotype variation in the females. Most modules were preserved between sexes and species, including those involved in conserved cellular processes (e.g. translation, immune pathways). However, two sex-specific male modules were identified, and these may contribute to sexual dimorphism. To compare with the network analysis, differentially expressed transcripts were identified between the sexes, finding a total of 16% of expressed transcripts as sex-biased. For both sexes, there was no overrepresentation of sex-biased genes or sex-specific modules on the putative sex chromosome. Sex-biased transcripts were also not overrepresented in sex-specific modules, and in fact highly male-biased transcripts were enriched in preserved modules. Comparative network analysis and differential expression analyses identified different aspects of sex differences in gene expression, and both provided new insights on the genes underlying sexual dimorphism in the salmonid Brook Charr.",

    "abstract": "Citizen science is an increasingly valuable tool for both scientists and educators. For researchers, citizen science is a means of more quickly investigating questions which would otherwise be time-consuming and costly to study. For educators, citizen science offers a means to engage students in actual research and improve learning outcomes. Since most citizen science projects are usually designed with research goals in mind, many lack the necessary educator materials for successful integration in a formal science education (FSE) setting. In an ideal world, researchers and educators would build the necessary materials together; however, many researchers lack the time, resources, and networks to create these materials early on in the life of a citizen science project. For resource-poor projects, we propose an intermediate entry point for recruiting from the educational setting: community service or service learning requirements (CSSLRs). Many schools require students to participate in community service or service learning activities in order to graduate. When implemented well, CSSLRs provide students with growth and development opportunities outside the classroom while contributing to the community and other worthwhile causes. However, CSSLRs take time, resources, and effort to implement well. Just as citizen science projects need to establish relationships to transition well into formal science education, schools need to cultivate relationships with community service organizations. Students and educators at schools with CSSLRs where implementation is still a work in progress may be left with a burdensome requirement and inadequate support. With the help of a volunteer fulfilling a CSSLR, we investigated the number of students impacted by CSSLRs set at different levels of government and explored the qualifications needed for citizen science projects to fulfill CSSLRs by examining the explicitly-stated justifications for having CSSLRs, surveying how CSSLRs are verified, and using these qualifications to demonstrate how an online citizen science project, Mark2Cure, could use this information to meet the needs of students fulfilling CSSLRs.",
