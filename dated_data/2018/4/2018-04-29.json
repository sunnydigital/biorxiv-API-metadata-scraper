    "abstract": "The role of the human microbiome in health and disease is increasingly appreciated. We studied the composition of microbial communities present in blood across 192 individuals, including healthy controls and patients with three disorders affecting the brain: schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and bipolar disorder. By using high quality unmapped RNA sequencing reads as candidate microbial reads, we performed profiling of microbial transcripts detected in whole blood. We were able to detect a wide range of bacterial and archaeal phyla in blood. Interestingly, we observed an increased microbial diversity in schizophrenia patients compared to the three other groups. We replicated this finding in an independent schizophrenia case-control cohort. This increased diversity is inversely correlated with estimated cell abundance of a subpopulation of CD8+ memory T cells in healthy controls, supporting a link between microbial products found in blood, immunity and schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Cell division during the reproductive phase of the Streptomyces life-cycle requires tight coordination between synchronous formation of multiple septa and DNA segregation. One remarkable difference with most other bacterial systems is that cell division in Streptomyces is positively controlled by the recruitment of FtsZ by SsgB. Here we show that deletion of ylmD (SCO2081) or ylmE (SCO2080), which lie in operon with ftsZ in the dcw cluster of actinomycetes, has major consequences for sporulation-specific cell division in Streptomyces coelicolor. Electron and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that ylmE mutants have a highly aberrant phenotype with defective septum synthesis, and produce very few spores with low viability and high heat sensitivity. FtsZ-ring formation was also highly disturbed in ylmE mutants. Deletion of ylmD had a far less severe effect on sporulation. Interestingly, the additional deletion of ylmD restored sporulation to the ylmE null mutant. YlmD and YlmE are not part of the divisome, but instead localize diffusely in aerial hyphae, with differential intensity throughout the sporogenic part of the hyphae. Taken together, our work reveals a function for YlmD and YlmE in the control of sporulation-specific cell division in S. coelicolor, whereby the presence of YlmD alone results in major developmental defects.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation in new environments depends on the amount and type of genetic variation available for evolution, and the efficacy by which natural selection discriminates among this variation to favour the survival of the fittest. However, whether some environments systematically reveal more genetic variation in fitness, or impose stronger selection pressures than others, is typically not known. Here, we apply enzyme kinetic theory to show that rising global temperatures are predicted to intensify natural selection systematically throughout the genome by increasing the effects of DNA sequence variation on protein stability. We tested this prediction by i) estimating temperature-dependent fitness effects of induced random mutations in seed beetles adapted to ancestral or warm temperature, and ii) calculating 100 paired selection estimates on mutations in benign versus stressful environments from a diverse set of unicellular and multicellular organisms. Environmental stress per se did not increase the mean strength of selection on de novo mutation, suggesting that the cost of adaptation does not generally increase in new environments to which the organism is maladapted. However, elevated temperature increased the mean strength of selection on genome-wide polymorphism, signified by increases in both mutation load and mutational variance at elevated temperature. The theoretical predictions and empirical data suggest that this increase may correspond to a doubling of genome-wide selection for a predicted 2-4{degrees}C climate warming scenario in ectothermic organism living at temperatures close to their thermal optimum. These results have important implications for global patterns of genetic diversity and the rate and repeatability of evolution under climate change.\n\nImpact StatementNatural environments are constantly changing so organisms must also change to persist. Whether they can do so ultimately depends upon the reservoir of raw genetic material available for evolution, and the efficacy by which natural selection discriminates among this variation to favour the survival of the fittest. Here, the biochemical properties of molecules and proteins that underpin the link between genotype and phenotype can exert a major influence over how the physical environment affects the expression of phenotypes and the fitness consequences of DNA sequence polymorphism. Yet, the constraints set by these molecular features are often neglected within eco-evolutionary theory trying to predict evolution in new environments. Here we combine predictions from existing biophysical models of protein folding and enzyme kinetics with experimental data from ectothermic organisms across the tree of life, to show that rising global temperatures are predicted to increase the mean strength of selection on DNA sequence variation in cold-blooded organisms. We also show that environmental stress per se generally does not increase the mean strength of selection on new mutations, suggesting that genome-wide natural selection is not stronger in new environments to which an organism is maladapted. Theoretical predictions and data suggest that an expected climate warming scenario of a 2-4{degrees}C temperature raise within the forthcoming century will result in roughly a doubling of genome-wide selection for organisms living close to their thermal optima. However, our results also point to substantial variability in the temperature-dependence of selection on different proteins within and between organisms, suggesting scope for compensatory adaptation to shape this relationship. These results bear witness to and extend the universal temperature dependence of biological rates and have important implications for global patterns of genetic diversity and the rate and repeatability of genome evolution under environmental change.",

    "abstract": "It has recently become clear that various antibiotics block the translation of bacterial proteins in a sequence-specific manner. In order to understand how this specificity contributes to antibiotic potency and select better antimicrobial leads, new high-throughput tools are needed. Here, we present inverse toeprinting, a new method to map the position of ribosomes arrested on messenger RNAs during in vitro translation. Unlike ribosome profiling, our method protects the entire coding region upstream of a stalled ribosome, making it possible to work with transcript libraries that randomly sample the sequence space. We used inverse toeprinting to characterize the pausing landscape of free and drug-bound bacterial ribosomes engaged in translation. We obtained a comprehensive list of arrest motifs that could be validated in vivo, along with a quantitative measure of their pause strength. Thus, our method provides a highly parallel and scalable means to characterize the sequence specificity of translation inhibitors.",

Despite their importance for understanding global ecological and evolutionary processes, plant-animal interaction gradients are particularly difficult to test systematically across large geographic gradients, and evidence from smaller, disparate studies is inconclusive. By systematically measuring post-dispersal seed predation using 6980 standardized seed depots along 18 mountains in the Pacific cordillera, we found that seed predation increases 18% from the Arctic to Equator and 16% from 4000 masl to sea level. Clines in total predation, likely driven by invertebrates, were consistent across tree-line ecotones and in continuous forest, and were better explained by climate seasonality than by productivity, biodiversity, or latitude. These results suggest that species interactions play predictably greater ecological and evolutionary roles in tropical, lowland, and other less seasonal ecosystems.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryPost-dispersal seed predation increases from the Arctic to the Equator and from high elevations to sea level.",

    "abstract": "Evidence that social and individual learning are at least partially dissociable sustains the belief that humans possess adaptive specialisations for social learning. However, in most extant paradigms, social information comprises an indirect source that can be used to supplement ones own, direct, experience. Thus, social and individual learning differ both in terms of social nature (social versus non-social) and directness (indirect versus direct). To test whether the dissociation between social and individual learning is best explained in terms of social nature or directness, we used a catecholaminergic challenge known to modulate learning. Two groups completed a decision-making task which required direct learning, from own experience, and indirect learning from an additional source. The groups differed in terms of whether the indirect source was social or non-social. The catecholamine transporter blocker, methylphenidate, affected direct learning by improving adaptation to changes in the volatility of the environment but there was no effect of methylphenidate on learning from the social or non-social indirect source. Thus, we report positive evidence for a dissociable effect of methylphenidate on direct and indirect learning, but no evidence for a distinction between social and non-social. These data fail to support the adaptive specialisation view, instead providing evidence for distinct mechanisms for direct versus indirect learning.",

Despite expressing most classical pDC markers such as SIGLEC-H and PDCA1, B-pDCs lack IFN- secretion, exhibiting a distinct inflammatory profile. Functionally, induce T cell proliferation more robustly than canonical pDCs following Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) engagement. B-pDCs also display elevated levels of the cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, mirroring human AXL+ transitional DCs in function and transcriptional profile.

    "abstract": "An increasing number of mammalian species have been shown to have a history of hybridization and introgression based on genetic analyses. Only relatively few fossils, however, preserve genetic material and morphology must be used to identify the species and determine whether morphologically intermediate fossils could represent hybrids. Because dental and cranial fossils are typically the key body parts studied in mammalian paleontology, here we bracket the potential for phenotypically extreme hybridizations by examining uniquely preserved cranio-dental material of a captive hybrid between gray and ringed seals. We analyzed how distinct these species are genetically and morphologically, how easy it is to identify the hybrids using morphology, and whether comparable hybridizations happen in the wild. We show that the genetic distance between these species is more than twice the modern human-Neanderthal distance, but still within that of morphologically similar species-pairs known to hybridize. In contrast, morphological and developmental analyses show gray and ringed seals to be highly disparate, and that the hybrid is a predictable intermediate. Genetic analyses of the parent populations reveal introgression in the wild, suggesting that gray-ringed seal hybridization is not limited to captivity. Taken together, gray and ringed seals appear to be in an adaptive radiation phase of evolution, showing large morphological differences relative to their comparatively modest genetic distance. Because morphological similarity does not always correlate with genetic distance in nature, we postulate that there is considerable potential for mammalian hybridization between phenotypically disparate taxa.",

We investigate the properties of this format using imputed data from the UK BiLEVE study, demonstrating both storage efficiency, and fast data loading performance on the order of hundreds of millions of imputed genotypes per second. To make using BGEN as easy as possible, we provide a detailed specification and a freely available reference implementation, and we leverage this by developing additional tools including an indexing tool (bgenix) and an R package (rbgen) that permits loading of BGEN-encoded data into the R statistical programming environment.

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by phenotypic heterogeneity and overlapping co-morbidities. The genetic architecture of ASD is complex, with 100s of risk genes cumulatively contributing to the aetiology of ASD. Epigenetic mechanisms, particularly DNA methylation, have been associated with ASD. The vast majority of ASD molecular research has focused on Northern European populations, with a paucity of data from Africa. This study examines genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in a novel cohort of South African children with ASD and matched, unrelated controls. We performed a whole-genome DNA methylation screen using the Illumina 450K Human Methylation Array. We identify differentially methylated loci associated with ASD across 898 genes (p-value [&le;] 0.05). Using a pathway analysis framework, we find nine enriched canonical pathways implicating 32 of the significant genes in our ASD cohort. These pathways converge on two crucial biological processes: mitochondrial metabolism and protein ubiquitination, both hallmarks of mitochondrial function. The involvement of mitochondrial function in ASD aetiology is in line with the recently reported transcriptomic dysregulation associated with the disorder. The differentially methylated genes in our cohort overlap with the gene co-expression modules identified in brain tissue from five major neurological disorders, including ASD. We find significant enrichment of three gene modules, two of which are classified as Mitochondrial and were significantly downregulated in ASD brains. Furthermore, we find significant overlap between differentially methylated and differentially expressed genes from our dataset with a RNA seq dataset from ASD brain tissue. This overlap is particularly significant across the Occipital brain region (padj= 0.0002) which has known association to ASD. Our differential methylation data recapitulate the expression differences of genes and co-expression module functions observed in ASD brain tissue which is consistent with a central role for DNA-methylation leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in the aetiology of ASD.",

Strikingly, we find that dramatic allele frequency change (i.e., genetic evolution) from strong selection at a single locus explains the rapid phenotypic shift observed after recent dam construction. Furthermore, ancient DNA analysis confirms the abundance of a specific allele associated with adult migration type in historical habitat that will soon become accessible through a large restoration (i.e., dam removal) project. However, analysis of contemporary samples suggests the restoration will be challenged by loss of the allele from potential source populations. These results highlight the need to conserve and restore critical adaptive variation before the potential for recovery is lost.",

    "abstract": "Initiation of immune responses requires innate immune sensing, but immune detection of the helminths, protists, and allergens that stimulate type 2 immunity remains poorly understood. In the small intestine, type 2 immune responses are regulated by a tuft cell-ILC2 signaling circuit. Tuft cells express components of a canonical taste transduction pathway, including the membrane channel TRPM5, but the ligands and receptors that activate tuft cells in the small intestine are unknown. Here we identify succinate as the first ligand that activates intestinal tuft cells to initiate type 2 immune responses. Using mRNA-Seq on tuft cells from different tissues, we show that all tuft cells express the intracellular taste transduction pathway, but expression of upstream receptors is tissue-specific. In the small intestine, tuft cells express the succinate receptor SUCNR1. Remarkably, providing succinate in drinking water is sufficient to induce a multifaceted type 2 immune response in the murine small intestine, involving all known components of the tuft-ILC2 circuit. The helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis secretes succinate as a metabolite, and sensing of both succinate and N. brasiliensis requires tuft cells and TRPM5, suggesting a novel paradigm in which type 2 immunity monitors microbial metabolism. Manipulation of succinate sensing may have therapeutic benefit in numerous intestinal diseases.",

Here we present full taxonomic classification of strain MBT76T, and show that it has chemotaxonomic, genomic and morphological properties consistent with its classification in the genus Streptomyces. Strain MBT76T is part of the cluster of Streptoverticillates, a group within the genus Streptomyces that has characteristic whorl-forming spores produced in chains along the lateral wall of the hyphae. Multi-locus sequence analysis based on five housekeeping gene alleles showed that MBT76T is closely related to Streptomyces hiroshimensis. Average Nucleotide Identification (ANI) and Genome to Genome Distance Calculation (GGDC) of the genomes of strain MBT76T and S. hiroshimensis separated them into distinct species. Strain MBT76T represents a novel species of the genus Streptomyces for which we propose the name Streptomyces roseofaciens sp. nov. The type strain is MBT76T (=NCCB 100637T =DSM 106196T). The whole genome of MBT76T has 7974 predicted open reading frames and a total genome size of 8.64 Mb. Further genomic analysis showed that verticillate streptomycetes lack the sporulation gene ssgE, and our data suggest that this is a useful genetic marker for the spore-chain morphology of the verticillates.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted vesicles of diverse size and cargo that are implicated in the cell-to-cell transmission of disease-causing-proteins in several neurodegenerative diseases. Mutant huntingtin, the disease-causing entity in Huntingtons disease, has an expanded polyglutamine track at the N terminus that causes the protein to misfold and form toxic intracellular aggregates. In Huntingtons disease, mutant huntingtin aggregates are transferred between cells by an unknown route. We have previously identified a cellular pathway that is responsible for the export of mutant huntingtin via extracellular vesicles, given the heterogeneity of EVs, here we examine the specific EVs involved. In this work we expressed a form of polyglutamine expanded huntingtin (GFP-tagged 72Qhuntingtinexon1) in cells to assess the EVs involved in cellular export. We demonstrate that the molecular chaperone, cysteine string protein (CSP; DnaJC5), mediates export of disease-causing-polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin cargo via two distinct vesicle populations of 180-240nm and 15-30m. In doing so, our data links the molecular chaperone, CSP, and the packaging of pathogenic misfolded huntingtin into two separate extracellular vesicles pathways.",

To elucidate the molecular origins of these forces, a recently developed coarsegrained molecular dynamics (CGMD) is used to directly simulate the observed pulling-force profiles, thereby disentangling contributions from NC-translocon and NC-ribosome interactions, membrane partitioning, and electrostatic coupling to the membrane potential. This combination of experiment and theory reveals mechanistic features of Sec-facilitated membrane integration and protein translocation, including the interplay between transient interactions and conformational changes that occur during ribosomal translation to govern protein biogenesis.",

Here, to identify cis-regulatory elements that control RNA-chromatin association, we developed a high-throughput method named RNA element for subcellular localization by sequencing (REL-seq). Coupling REL-seq with random mutagenesis (mutREL-seq), we discovered a key 7-nt U1 recognition motif in chromatin-enriched RNA elements. Reporter assays indicated a direct role for U1 snRNP recognition in regulating RNA-chromatin localization. Globally, U1 motifs and U1 binding are strongly enriched in long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts. Inhibition of U1 snRNA, and of U2 to a lesser degree, led to global reduction in chromatin association of hundreds of lncRNAs. For promoter- and enhancer-associated noncoding RNAs, U1 binds to their genomic neighborhoods, and their chromatin association depends on both U1 and U2 snRNAs. These findings reveal that U1 snRNP, perhaps together with the splicing machinery, acts widely to promote the chromatin association of noncoding transcripts.",

    "abstract": "Sexual maturation and reproduction influence the status of a number of physiological processes and consequently the ecology and behaviour of cephalopods. Using Octopus mimus as model species, the present study examined the changes in biochemical composition that take place during gonadal maturation of octopus females and its consequences in embryo and hatchlings characteristics, including energetic metabolites, digestive enzymes and antioxidant defence mechanisms. A total of 32 Octopus mimus adult females were sampled during ovarian maturation; biochemical composition (metabolites and digestive enzymes) of digestive gland (DG) and ovaries (only metabolites) were followed during physiological and functional maturation. Levels of protein (Prot), triacyl glycerol (TG), cholesterol (Chol), glucose (Glu) and glycogen (Gly) were evaluated. The activity of alkaline and acidic enzymes also was measured in DG. Simultaneously, groups of eggs coming from mature females were sampled along development, and metabolites (Prot, TG, Glu, Gly, TG, Chol), digestive enzymes activity (Lipases, alkaline and acidic), antioxidant defence mechanisms and radical oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated. This study shows that ovarium is a site for reserve of some nutrients for reproduction. Presumably, TG where stored at the beginning of the maturation processes followed by Chol, both at the same time were energetically supported by Glu, derived from Gly following gluconeogenic pathways. Nutrients and enzymes (metabolic, digestive and REDOX system) where maintained without significant changes and in a low activity during organogenesis. Our findings suggest that activity was not energetically costly; in contrast, during the embryo growth there was mobilization of nutrients and activation of the metabolic and digestive enzymes. Increments in consumption of yolk and glycogen, and reduction in molecules associated with oxidative stress allowed paralarvae to hatch with the antioxidant defence mechanisms ready to support ROS production.",

    "abstract": "Waddingtons epigenetic landscape is a classic metaphor for describing the cellular dynamics during the development modulated by gene regulation. Quantifying Waddingtons epigenetic landscape by mathematical modeling would be useful for understanding the mechanisms of cell fate determination. A few computational methods have been proposed for quantitative modeling of landscape; however, to model and visualize the landscape of a high dimensional gene regulatory system with realistic details is still challenging. Here, we propose a Monte Carlo method for modeling the Waddingtons epigenetic landscape of a gene regulatory network (GRN). The method estimates the probability distribution of cellular states by collecting a large number of time-course simulations with random initial conditions. By projecting all the trajectories into a 2-dimensional plane of dimensions i and j, we can approximately calculate the quasi-potential U (xi, xj) = -ln P (xi, xj), where P (xi, xj) is the estimated probability of an equilibrium steady state or a non-equilibrium state. A state with locally maximal probability corresponds to a locally minimal potential and such a state is called an attractor. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our Monte Carlo method can quantify the global potential landscape (or emergence behavior) of GRN for a high dimensional system. The same topography of landscape can be produced from deterministic or stochastic time-course simulations. The potential landscapes show that not only attractors represent stability, but the paths between attractors are also part of the stability or robustness of biological systems. We demonstrate the novelty and reliability of our method by plotting the potential landscapes of a few published models of GRN. Besides GRN-driven landscapes of cellular dynamics, the algorithm proposed can also be applied to studies of global dynamics (or emergence behavior) of other dynamical systems.",

    "abstract": "Screening for successful CRISPR/Cas9 editing events remains a time consuming technical bottleneck in the field of Drosophila genome editing. This step can be particularly laborious for events that do not cause a visible phenotype, or those which occur at relatively low frequency. A promising strategy to enrich for desired CRISPR events is to co-select for an independent CRISPR event that produces an easily detectable phenotype. Here, we describe a simple negative co-selection strategy involving CRISPR-editing of a dominant female sterile allele, ovoD1. In this system (\\\"ovoD co-selection\\\"), the only functional germ cells in injected females are those that have been edited at the ovoD1 locus, and thus 100% of the offspring of these flies have undergone editing of at least one locus. We demonstrate that ovoD co-selection can be used to enrich for knock-out mutagenesis via nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), and for knock-in alleles via homology-directed repair (HDR). Altogether, our results demonstrate that ovoD co-selection reduces the amount of screening necessary to isolate desired CRISPR events in Drosophila.",

ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.",

We resolve how EGFRs response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) originates from dynamically established recursive interactions with spatially organized protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Opposed genetic PTP perturbations enabled identification of receptor-like PTPRG/J at the plasma membrane (PM) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated PTPN2 as the major EGFR dephosphorylating activities. Imaging spatial-temporal PTP reactivity then revealed that vesicular trafficking establishes a spatially-distributed negative feedback with PTPN2 that determines signal duration, whereas single cell dose-response analysis uncovered a ROS-mediated toggle switch between autocatalytically activated monomeric EGFR and the tumor suppressor PTPRG that governs EGFRs sensitivity to EGF. Vesicular recycling of monomeric EGFR unifies the interactions with these PTPs on juxtaposed membranes, dynamically generating a network architecture that can sense and respond to time varying growth factor signals.",
