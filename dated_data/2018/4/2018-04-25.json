    "abstract": "Gene regulatory networks describe the regulatory relationships among genes, and developing methods for reverse engineering these networks are an ongoing challenge in computational biology. The majority of the initially proposed methods for gene regulatory network discovery create a network of genes and then mine it in order to uncover previously unknown regulatory processes. More recent approaches have focused on inferring modules of co-regulated genes, linking these modules with regulator genes and then mining them to discover new molecular biology.\\n\\nIn this work we analyze module-based network approaches to build gene regulatory networks, and compare their performance to the well-established single gene network approaches. In particular, we focus on the problem of linking genes with known regulatory genes. First, modules are created iteratively using a regression approach that links co-expressed genes with few regulatory genes. After the modules are built, we create bipartite graphs to identify a set of target genes for each regulatory gene. We analyze several methods for uncovering these modules and show that a variational Bayes approach achieves significant improvement with respect to previously used methods for module creation on both simulated and real data. We also perform a topological and gene set enrichment analysis and compare several module-based approaches to single gene network approaches where a graph is built from the gene expression profiles without clustering genes in modules. We show that the module-based approach with variational Bayes outperforms all other methods and creates regulatory networks with a significantly higher rate of enriched molecular pathways.\\n\\nThe code is written in R and can be downloaded from https://github.com/mikelhernaez/linker.",

    "abstract": "Preprocessing of functional MRI (fMRI) involves numerous steps to clean and standardize data before statistical analysis. Generally, researchers create ad hoc preprocessing workflows for each new dataset, building upon a large inventory of tools available for each step. The complexity of these workflows has snowballed with rapid advances in MR data acquisition and image processing techniques. We introduce fMRIPrep, an analysis-agnostic tool that addresses the challenge of robust and reproducible preprocessing for task-based and resting fMRI data. FMRIPrep automatically adapts a best-in-breed workflow to the idiosyncrasies of virtually any dataset, ensuring high-quality preprocessing with no manual intervention. By introducing visual assessment checkpoints into an iterative integration framework for software-testing, we show that fMRIPrep robustly produces high-quality results on a diverse fMRI data collection comprising participants from 54 different studies in the OpenfMRI repository. We review the distinctive features of fMRIPrep in a qualitative comparison to other preprocessing workflows. We demonstrate that fMRIPrep achieves higher spatial accuracy as it introduces less uncontrolled spatial smoothness than commonly used preprocessing tools. FMRIPrep has the potential to transform fMRI research by equipping neuroscientists with a high-quality, robust, easy-to-use and transparent preprocessing workflow which can help ensure the validity of inference and the interpretability of their results.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental damage caused by virus infections remain poorly defined. Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is the leading cause of fetal brain development disorders. Previous work has linked HCMV to perturbations of neural cell fate, including premature differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here we show that HCMV infection of NPCs results in the loss of the SOX2 protein, a key pluripotency-associated transcription factor. SOX2 depletion maps to the HCMV major immediate-early (IE) transcription unit and is individually mediated by the IE1 and IE2 proteins. IE1 causes SOX2 down-regulation by promoting the nuclear accumulation and inhibiting the phosphorylation of STAT3, a transcriptional activator of SOX2 expression. Deranged signaling resulting in depletion of a critical stem cell protein is an unanticipated mechanism by which the viral major IE proteins may contribute to brain development disorders caused by congenital HCMV infection.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections are a leading cause of brain damage, hearing loss and other neurological disabilities in children. We report that the HCMV proteins known as IE1 and IE2 target expression of human SOX2, a central pluripotency-associated transcription factor that governs neural progenitor cell (NPC) fate and is required for normal brain development. Both during HCMV infection and when expressed alone, IE1 causes the loss of SOX2 from NPCs. IE1 mediates SOX2 depletion by targeting STAT3, a critical upstream regulator of SOX2 expression. Our findings reveal an unanticipated mechanism by which a common virus may cause damage to the developing nervous system and suggest novel targets for medical intervention.",
