    "abstract": "Integrating network theory approaches over longitudinal genome-wide gene expression data is a robust approach to understand the molecular underpinnings of a dynamic biological process. Here, we performed a network-based investigation of longitudinal gene expression changes during sporulation of a yeast strain, SK1. Using global network attributes, viz. clustering coefficient, degree distribution of a node, degree-degree mixing of the connected nodes and disassortativity, we observed dynamic changes in these parameters indicating a highly connected network with inter-module crosstalk. Analysis of local attributes, such as clustering coefficient, hierarchy, betweenness centrality and Granovetters weak ties showed that there was an inherent hierarchy under regulatory control that was determined by specific nodes. Biological annotation of these nodes indicated the role of specifically linked pairs of genes in meiosis. These genes act as crucial regulators of sporulation in the highly sporulating SK1 strain. An independent analysis of these network properties in a less efficient sporulating strain helped to understand the heterogeneity of network profiles. We show that comparison of network properties has the potential to identify candidate nodes contributing to the phenotypic diversity of developmental processes in natural populations. Therefore, studying these network parameters as described in this work for dynamic developmental processes, such as sporulation in yeast and eventually in disease progression in humans, can help in identifying candidate factors which are potential regulators of differences between normal and perturbed processes and can be causal targets for intervention.",

    "abstract": "How the brain preserves information about multiple simultaneous items is poorly understood. We report that single neurons can represent multiple different stimuli by interleaving different signals across time. We record single units in an auditory region, the inferior colliculus, while monkeys localize 1 or 2 simultaneous sounds. During dual-sound trials, we find that some neurons fluctuate between firing rates observed for each single sound, either on a whole-trial or on a sub-trial timescale. These fluctuations are correlated in pairs of neurons, can be predicted by the state of local field potentials prior to sound onset, and, in one monkey, can predict which sound will be reported first. We find corroborating evidence of fluctuating activity patterns in a separate data set involving responses of inferotemporal cortex neurons to multiple visual stimuli. Alternation between activity patterns corresponding to each of multiple items may therefore be a general strategy to enhance the brain processing capacity, potentially linking such disparate phenomena as variable neural firing, neural oscillations, and limits in attentional/memory capacity.",

To what extent is the Tree of Life not truly a tree reflecting strict \\\"vertical\\\" divergence, but rather a more general graph structure known as a phylogenetic network which also captures \\\"horizontal\\\"gene flow? The answer to this fundamental question not only depends upon densely sampled and divergent genomic sequence data, but also compu-tational methods which are capable of accurately and efficiently inferring phylogenetic networks from large-scale genomic sequence datasets. Re-cent methodological advances have attempted to address this gap. How-ever, in the 2016 performance study of Hejase and Liu, state-of-the-art methods fell well short of the scalability requirements of existing phy-logenomic studies.\\n\\nThe methodological gap remains: how can phylogenetic networks be ac-curately and efficiently inferred using genomic sequence data involving many dozens or hundreds of taxa? In this study, we address this gap by proposing a new phylogenetic divide-and-conquer method which we call FastNet.

We assessed the influence of P. falciparum on the blood-feeding behaviour of three of its major vectors (Anopheles coluzzii, An. gambiae and An. arabiensis) in Burkina Faso. Host preference assays using odour-baited traps revealed no effect of infection on mosquito long-range anthropophily. However, the identification of the blood meal origin of mosquitoes showed that females carrying sporozoites, the mature transmissible stage of the parasite, displayed a 24% increase in anthropophagy compared to both females harbouring oocysts, the parasite immature stage, and uninfected individuals. Using a mathematical model, we further showed that this increased anthropophagy in infectious females resulted in a > 250% increase in parasite transmission potential, everything else being equal. This important epidemiological consequence highlights the importance of vector control tools targeting infectious females.",

    "abstract": "A minimal model for oscillating between quiescent and growth/proliferation states, dependent on the availability of a central metabolic resource, is presented. From the yeast metabolic cycles (YMCs), metabolic oscillations in oxygen consumption are represented as transitions between quiescent and growth states. We consider metabolic resource availability, growth rates, and switching rates (between states) to model a relaxation oscillator explaining transitions between these states. This frustrated bistability model reveals a required communication between the metabolic resource that determines oscillations, and the quiescent and growth state cells. Cells in each state reflect memory, or hysteresis of their current state, and \\\"push-pull\\\" cells from the other state. Finally, a parsimonious argument is made for a specific central metabolite as the controller of switching between quiescence and growth states. We discuss how an oscillator built around the availability of such a metabolic resource is sufficient to generally regulate oscillations between growth and quiescence, through committed transitions.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the statistical structure of the environment is crucial for adaptive behavior. Humans and non-human decision-makers seem to track such structure through a process of probabilistic inference, which enables predictions about behaviorally relevant events. Deviations from such predictions cause surprise, which in turn helps improve the inference. Surprise about the timing of behaviorally relevant sensory events drives phasic responses of neuromodulatory brainstem systems, which project to the cerebral cortex. Here, we developed a computational model-based magnetoencephalography (MEG) approach for mapping the resulting cortical transients across space, time, and frequency, in the human brain. We used a Bayesian updating model to estimate the predicted timing of the next stimulus change in a simple visual detection task. This model yielded quantitative trial-by-trial estimates of temporal surprise. The model-based surprise variable predicted trial-by-trial variations in reaction time more strongly than the externally observable interval timings alone. Trial-by-trial variations in surprise were negatively correlated with the power of cortical population activity measured with MEG. This surprise-related power suppression occurred transiently around the behavioral response, specifically in the beta frequency band. It peaked in left lateral prefrontal as well as in frontal midline regions, and its cortical distribution was distinct from the movement-related suppression of beta power in motor cortex. Our results indicate that surprise about sensory event timing transiently suppresses ongoing beta-band oscillations in association cortex. This transient suppression of frontal beta-band oscillations might reflect an active reset triggered by surprise, and is in line with the idea that beta-oscillations help maintain cognitive sets.\\n\\nSignificance statementAgents continuously track the statistical structure of the environment, in order to make predictions about behaviorally relevant sensory events. Deviations from such predictions cause surprise, which in turn drives phasic responses of neuromodulatory brainstem systems that project to the cerebral cortex. We developed a computational model-based magnetoencephalography approach, which enabled us to map out transients changes in cortical population dynamics elicited by surprise about sensory event timing, across space, time, and frequency, in the human brain. The model-based estimates of surprise predicted behavior as well as a transient suppression of beta frequency-band oscillations in frontal cortical regions. Our results are in line with conceptual accounts that have linked neural oscillations in the beta-band to the maintenance of cognitive sets.",

    "abstract": "Collective action dilemmas pervade the social and biological sciences - from human decision-making to bacterial quorum sensing. In these scenarios, individuals sense cues from the environment to adopt a suitable phenotype or change in behavior. However, when cues include signals from other individuals, then the appropriate behavior of each individual is linked. Here, we develop a framework to quantify the influence of information sharing on individual behavior in the context of two player coordination games. In this framework, the environment stochastically switches between two states, and the state determines which one of two actions players must coordinate on. Given a stochastically switching environment, we then consider two versions of the game that differ in the way players acquire information. In the first model, players independently sense private environmental cues, but do not communicate with each other. We find there are two types of strategies that emerge as Nash equilibria and fitness maximizers - players prefer to commit to one particular action when private information is poor, or prefer to employ phenotypic plasticity when it is good. The second model adds an additional layer of communication, where players share social cues as well. When the quality of social information is high, we find the socially optimal strategy is a novel \\\"majority logic\\\" strategy that bases decision-making on social cues. Our game-theoretic approach offers a principled way of investigating the role of communication in group decision-making under uncertain conditions.",

    "abstract": "Bystander selection -- the selective pressures exerted by antibiotics on microbial flora that are not the target pathogen of treatment -- is critical to understanding the total impact of broad-spectrum antibiotic use; however, to our knowledge, this effect has never been quantified. Using the 2010-2011 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS/NHAMCS), the Human Microbiome Project, and additional carriage and etiological data from existing literature, we estimate the magnitude of bystander selection for a range of clinically relevant antibiotic-species pairs as the proportion of all exposures of an antibiotic experienced by a species for conditions in which that species was not the causative pathogen (\\\"proportion of bystander exposures\\\"). For outpatient prescribing in the United States, we find that this proportion over all included antibiotics is over 80% for 8 out of 9 organisms of interest. Low proportions of bystander exposure are often associated with infrequent bacterial carriage or a high proportion of antibiotic prescribing focused on conditions caused by the species of interest. Using the proportion of bystander exposures, we roughly estimate that S. aureus and E. coli may benefit from 90.7% and 99.7%, respectively, of the estimated reduction in antibiotic use due to pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, despite not being the pathogen targeted by the vaccine. These results underscore the importance of considering antibiotic exposures to bystanders, in addition to the targeted pathogen, in measuring the impact of antibiotic resistance interventions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe forces that contribute to changing population prevalence of antibiotic resistance are not well understood. Bystander selection -- the inadvertent pressures imposed by antibiotics on the microbial flora other than the pathogen targeted by treatment -- is hypothesized to be a major factor in the propagation of antibiotic resistance, but its extent has not been characterized. We estimate the proportion of bystander exposures across a range of antibiotics and organisms and describe factors driving variability of these proportions. Impact estimates for antibiotic resistance interventions, including vaccination, are often limited to effects on a target pathogen. However, the reduction of antibiotic treatment for illnesses caused by the target pathogen may have the broader potential to decrease bystander selection pressures for resistance on many other organisms.",

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis is a crucial step in tumor progression, as this process allows tumors to recruit new blood vessels and obtain oxygen and nutrients to sustain growth. Therefore, inhibiting angiogenesis remains a viable strategy for cancer therapy. However, anti-angiogenic therapy has not proved to be effective in reducing tumor growth across a wide range of tumors, and no reliable predictive biomarkers have been found to determine the efficacy of anti-angiogenic treatment. Using our previously established computational model of tumor-bearing mice, we sought to determine whether tumor growth kinetic parameters could be used to predict the outcome of anti-angiogenic treatment. A model trained with datasets from six in vivo mice studies was used to generate a randomized in silico tumor-bearing mouse population. We analyzed tumor growth in untreated mice (control) and mice treated with an anti-angiogenic agent and determined the Kaplan-Meier survival estimates based on simulated tumor volume data. We found that the ratio between two kinetic parameters, k0 and k1, which characterize the tumors exponential and linear growth rates, as well as k1 alone, can be used as prognostic biomarkers of population survival outcome. Our work demonstrates a robust, quantitative approach for identifying tumor growth kinetic parameters as prognostic biomarkers and serves as a template that can be used to identify other biomarkers for anti-angiogenic treatment.",

    "abstract": "Aptamer selections often yield distinct subpopulations, each with unique phenotypes that can be leveraged for specialized applications. RNA aptamers that bind HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) exhibit potent RT inhibition and suppress viral replication when targeting the strain-specific RT that they were originally selected to bind, but some of these same aptamers fail against single-point mutant and phylogenetically-diverse RTs. We hypothesized that a subset of the total aptamer population in libraries pre-enriched against a single RT may exhibit broad-spectrum RT binding and inhibition, and we devised a multiplexed Poly-Target selection approach to elicit those phenotypes against a panel of diverse primate lentiviral RTs. High-throughput sequencing of starting, negative, and final libraries, followed by analysis of coenrichment and codepletion in parallel and duplicate selection trajectories, narrowed the list of candidate aptamers by orders of magnitude. Biochemical characterization of candidates identified a novel aptamer motif and several rare and unobserved variants of previously-known motifs that inhibited recombinant RTs from HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV to varying degrees. These broad-spectrum aptamers also suppressed replication of viral constructs carrying phylogenetically-diverse RTs. The Poly-Target selection and coenrichment approach described herein is a generalizable strategy for identifying broad-spectrum behavior and cross-reactivity among related targets from combinatorial libraries.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInfections with helminths cause an enormous disease burden in billions of animals and plants worldwide. Large scale use of anthelmintics has driven the evolution of resistance in a number of species that infect livestock and companion animals, and there are growing concerns regarding the reduced efficacy in some human-infective helminths. Understanding the mechanisms by which resistance evolves is the focus of increasing interest; robust genetic analysis of helminths is challenging, and although many candidate genes have been proposed, the genetic basis of resistance remains poorly resolved.\n\nResultsHere, we present a genome-wide analysis of two genetic crosses between ivermectin resistant and sensitive isolates of the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus, an economically important gastrointestinal parasite of small ruminants and a model for anthelmintic research. Whole genome sequencing of parental populations, and key stages throughout the crosses, identified extensive genomic diversity that differentiates populations, but after backcrossing and selection, a single genomic quantitative trait locus (QTL) localised on chromosome V was revealed to be associated with ivermectin resistance. This QTL was common between the two geographically and genetically divergent resistant populations and did not include any leading candidate genes, suggestive of a previously uncharacterised mechanism and/or driver of resistance. Despite limited resolution due to low recombination in this region, population genetic analyses and novel evolutionary models supported strong selection at this Q.TL, driven by at least partial dominance of the resistant allele, and that large resistance-associated haplotype blocks were enriched in response to selection.\n\nConclusionsWe have described the genetic architecture and mode of ivermectin selection, revealing a major genomic locus associated with ivermectin resistance, the most conclusive evidence to date in any parasitic nematode. This study highlights a novel genome-wide approach to the analysis of a genetic cross in non-model organisms with extreme genetic diversity, and the importance of a high quality reference genome in interpreting the signals of selection so identified.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThere is a notable absence of consensus on how to generate estimates ofpopulation-level incidence. Incidence is a considerably more sensitive and harder to estimate indicator of epidemiological trends than prevalence. We used a novel hybrid method to estimate HIV incidence by age and sex in a rural district of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.\\n\\nMethodsOur novel method uses an  optimal weighting of estimates based on an implementation of a particular  synthetic cohort approach (interpreting the age/time structure of prevalence, in conjunction with estimates of excess mortality) and biomarkers of  recent infection (combining Lag-Avidity, Bio-Rad Avidity and viral load results to define recent infection, and adapting the method for age-specific incidence estimation). Data were obtained from a population-based cross-sectional HIV survey conducted in Mbongolwane and Eshowe health service areas in 2013.\\n\\nResultsUsing the combined method, we find that age-specific HIV incidence in females rose rapidly during adolescence, from 1.33 cases/100 person-years (95% CI:0.98,1.67) at age 15 to a peak of 5.01/100PY (4.14,5.87) at age 23. In males, incidence was lower, 0.34/100PY (0.00-0.74) at age 15, and rose later, peaking at 3.86/100PY(2.52-5.20) at age 30. Susceptible population-weighted average incidence in females aged 15-29 was estimated at 3.84/100PY (3.36-4.40), in males aged 15-29 at 1.28/100PY(0.68-1.50) and in all individuals aged 15-29 at 2.55/100PY (2.09-2.76). Using the conventional recency biomarker approach, we estimated HIV incidence among females aged 15-29 at 2.99/100PY (1.79-4.36), among males aged 15-29 at 0.87/100PY(0.22-1.60) and among all individuals aged 15-59 at 1.66/100PY (1.13-2.27).\\n\\nDiscussionHIV incidence was very high in women aged 15-30, peaking in the early 20s. Men had lower incidence, which peaked at age 30. The estimates obtained from the hybrid method are more informative than those produced by conventional analysis of biomarker data, and represents a more optimal use of available data than either the age-continuous biomarker or synthetic cohort methods alone. The method is mainly useful at younger ages, where excess mortality is low and uncertainty in the synthetic cohort estimates is reasonably small.\\n\\nConclusionApplication of this method to large-scale population-based HIV prevalence surveys is likely to result in improved incidence surveillance over methods currently in wide use. Reasonably accurate and precise age-specific estimates of incidence are important to target better prevention, diagnosis and care strategies.",

Intracellular Ca2+ signaling, especially Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is considered to be crucial for the regulation of astrocytic functions. Mice with genetic deletion of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 2 (IP3R2) are reportedly devoid of astrocytic Ca2+ signaling, and thus widely used to explore the roles of Ca2+ signaling in astrocytic functions. While functional deficits in IP3R2-knockout (KO) mice have been found in some reports, no functional deficit was observed in others. Thus, there remains a controversy regarding the functional significance of astrocytic Ca2+ signaling. To address this controversy, we re-evaluated the assumption that Ca2+ release from the ER is abolished in IP3R2-KO astrocytes using a highly sensitive imaging technique. We expressed the ER luminal Ca2+ indicator G-CEPIA1er in cortical and hippocampal astrocytes to directly visualize spontaneous and stimulus-induced Ca2+ release from the ER. We found attenuated but significant Ca2+ release in response to application of norepinephrine to IP3R2-KO astrocytes. This IP3R2-independent Ca2+ release induced only minimal cytosolic Ca2+ transients but induced robust Ca2+ increases in mitochondria that are frequently in close contact with the ER. These results indicate that ER Ca2+ release is retained and is sufficient to increase the Ca2+ concentration in close proximity to the ER in IP3R2-KO astrocytes.",

    "abstract": "MotivationTaxonomic classification is at the core of environmental DNA analysis. When a phylogenetic tree can be built as a prior hypothesis to such classification, phylogenetic placement (PP) provides the most informative type of classification because each query sequence is assigned to its putative origin in the tree. This is useful whenever precision is sought (e.g. in diagnostics). However,likelihood-based PP algorithms struggle to scale with the ever-increasing throughput of DNA sequencing.\\n\\nResultsWe have developed RAPPAS (Rapid Alignment-free Phylogenetic Placement via Ancestral Sequences) which uses an alignment-free approach, removing the hurdle of query sequence alignment as a preliminary step to PP. Our approach relies on the precomputation of a database of k-mers that may be present with non-negligible probability in relatives of the reference sequences. The placement is performed by inspecting the stored phylogenetic origins of the k-mers in the query, and their probabilities. The database can be reused for the analysis of several different metagenomes. Experiments show that the first implementation of RAPPAS is already faster than competing likelihood-based PP algorithms, while keeping similar accuracy for short reads. RAPPAS scales PP for the era of routine metagenomic diagnostics.\\n\\nAvailabilityProgram and sources freely available for download at gite.lirmm.fr/linard/RAPPAS.\\n\\nContactbenjamin.linard@lirmm.fr",

    "abstract": "Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) create unparalleled levels of protein sequence variation through mutagenic retrohoming. Sequence information is transferred from an invariant template region (TR), through an RNA intermediate, to a protein-coding variable region. Selective infidelity at adenines during transfer is a hallmark of DGRs from disparate bacteria, archaea, and microbial viruses. We recapitulated selective infidelity in vitro for the prototypical Bordetella bacteriophage DGR. A complex of the DGR reverse transcriptase bRT and pentameric accessory variability determinant (Avd) protein along with DGR RNA were necessary and sufficient for synthesis of template-primed, covalently linked RNA-cDNA molecules, as observed in vivo. We identified RNAcDNA molecules to be branched and most plausibly linked through 2'-5' phosphodiester bonds. Adenine-mutagenesis was intrinsic to the bRT-Avd complex, which displayed unprecedented promiscuity while reverse transcribing adenines of either DGR or non-DGR RNA templates. In contrast, bRT-Avd processivity was strictly dependent on the template, occurring only for the DGR RNA. This restriction was mainly due to a noncoding segment downstream of TR, which specifically bound Avd and created a privileged site for processive polymerization. Restriction to DGR RNA may protect the host genome from damage. These results define the early steps in a novel pathway for massive sequence diversification.",

Molecular simulations can potentially provide powerful insights into the nature of these relationships.

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using droplet microfluidics occasionally produces transcriptome data representing more than one cell. These technical artifacts are caused by cell doublets formed during cell capture and occur at a frequency proportional to the total number of sequenced cells. The presence of doublets can lead to spurious biological conclusions, which justifies the practice of sequencing fewer cells to limit doublet formation rates. Here, we present a computational doublet detection tool - DoubletFinder - that identifies doublets based solely on gene expression features. DoubletFinder infers the putative gene expression profile of real doublets by generating artificial doublets from existing scRNA-seq data. Neighborhood detection in gene expression space then identifies sequenced cells with increased probability of being doublets based on their proximity to artificial doublets. DoubletFinder robustly identifies doublets across scRNA-seq datasets with variable numbers of cells and sequencing depth, and predicts false-negative and false-positive doublets defined using conventional barcoding approaches. We anticipate that DoubletFinder will aid in scRNA-seq data analysis and will increase the throughput and accuracy of scRNA-seq experiments.",

    "abstract": "Hydroxyl radical protein footprinting (HRPF) is a powerful method for measuring protein topography, allowing researchers to monitor events that alter the solvent accessible surface of a protein (e.g. ligand binding, aggregation, conformational changes, etc.) by measuring changes in the apparent rate of reaction of portions of the protein to hydroxyl radicals diffusing in solution. Fast Photochemical Oxidation of Proteins (FPOP) offers an ultra-fast benchtop method for performing HRPF, photolyzing hydrogen peroxide using a UV laser to generate high concentrations of hydroxyl radicals that are consumed on roughly a microsecond timescale. The broad reactivity of hydroxyl radicals means that almost anything added to the solution (e.g. ligands, buffers, excipients, etc.) will scavenge hydroxyl radicals, altering their half-life and changing the effective radical concentration experienced by the protein. Similarly, minute changes in peroxide concentration, laser fluence, and buffer composition can alter the effective radical concentration, making reproduction of data challenging. Here, we present a simple method for radical dosimetry that can be carried out as part of the FPOP workflow, allowing for measurement of effective radical concentration in real time. Additionally, by modulating the amount of radical generated, we demonstrate that FPOP HRPF experiments carried out in buffers with widely differing levels of hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity can be normalized on the fly, yielding statistically indistinguishable results for the same conformer. This method represents a major step in transforming FPOP into a robust and reproducible technology capable of probing protein structure in a wide variety of contexts.",

We also provide evidence that previous analyses were confounded by population stratification Therefore, the conclusion of strong polygenic adaptation now lacks support. Moreover, these discrepancies highlight (1) that methods for correcting for population stratification in GWAS may not always be sufficient for polygenic trait analyses, and (2) that claims of differences in polygenic scores between populations should be treated with caution until these issues are better understood.",

Given a set of potential biomarkers PReMS searches over many logistic regression models constructed from optimal subsets of the biomarkers, iteratively increasing the model size. Zero centred Gaussian prior distributions are assigned to all regression coefficients to induce shrinkage. The method estimates the optimal shrinkage parameter, optimal model for each model size and the optimal model size. We apply PReMS to six freely available data sets and compare its performance with the LASSO and SCAD algorithms in terms of the number of covariates in the model, model accuracy, as measured by the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) and root predicted mean square error, and model calibration. We show that PReMS typically selects models with fewer biomarkers than both the LASSO and SCAD algorithms but has comparable predictive accuracy.\\n\\nAvailability: (PReMS) is freely available as an R package https://github.com/clivehoggart/PReMS",

We employed functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in combination with a version of the Ultimatum Game (UG) where participants were provided with information about their partners moral traits previous to their fair or unfair offers. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed the implication of the supplementary motor area (SMA) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the representation of expectations about the partners in the game. Further, these regions also represented the valence of expectations, together with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Importantly, the performance of multivariate classifiers in these clusters correlated with a behavioural choice bias to accept more offers following positive descriptions, highlighting the impact of the valence on the expectations on participants economic decisions. Altogether, our results suggest that expectations based on social information guide future interpersonal decisions and that the neural representation of such expectations in the vmPFC is related to their influence on behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Herpesvirus genomes are decoded by host RNA polymerase II, generating messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) that are post-transcriptionally modified and exported to the cytoplasm. These viral mRNAs have 5 ' -m7GTP caps and poly(A) tails that should permit assembly of canonical eIF4F cap-binding complexes to initiate protein synthesis. However, we have shown that chemical disruption of eIF4F does not impede KSHV lytic replication, suggesting that alternative translation initiation mechanisms support viral protein synthesis. Here, using polysome profiling analysis, we confirmed that eIF4F disassembly did not affect the efficient translation of viral mRNAs during lytic replication, whereas a large fraction of host mRNAs remained eIF4F-dependent. Lytic replication altered multiple host translation initiation factors (TIFs), causing caspase-dependent cleavage of eIF2 and eIF4G1 and decreasing levels of eIF4G2 and eIF4G3. Non-eIF4F TIFs NCBP1, eIF4E2 and eIF4G2 associated with actively translating messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes during KSHV lytic replication, but their depletion by RNA silencing did not affect virion production, suggesting that the virus does not exclusively rely on one of these alternative TIFs for efficient viral protein synthesis. METTL3, an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase that modifies mRNAs and influences translational efficiency, was dispensable for early viral gene expression and genome replication but required for late gene expression and virion production. METTL3 was also subject to caspase-dependent degradation during lytic replication, suggesting that its positive effect on KSHV late gene expression may be indirect. Taken together, our findings reveal extensive remodelling of TIFs during lytic replication, which may help sustain efficient viral protein synthesis in the context of host shutoff.\n\nIMPORTANCEViruses use host cell protein synthesis machinery to create viral proteins. Herpesviruses have evolved a variety of ways to gain control over this host machinery to ensure priority synthesis of viral proteins and diminished synthesis of host proteins with antiviral properties. We have shown that a herpesvirus called KSHV disrupts normal cellular control of protein synthesis. A host cell protein complex called eIF4F starts translation of most cellular mRNAs, but we observed it is dispensable for efficient synthesis of viral proteins. Several proteins involved in alternative modes of translation initiation were likewise dispensable. However, an enzyme called METTL3 that modifies mRNAs is required for efficient synthesis of certain late KSHV proteins and productive infection. We observed caspase-dependent degradation of several host cell translation initiation proteins during infection, suggesting that the virus alters pools of available factors to favour efficient viral protein synthesis at the expense of host protein synthesis.",

    "abstract": "High-level behaviour of metabolic systems results from the properties of, and interactions between, numerous molecular components. Reaching a complete understanding of metabolic behaviour based on the systems components is therefore a difficult task. This problem can be tackled by constructing and subsequently analysing kinetic models of metabolic pathways since such models aim to capture all the relevant properties of the system components and their interactions.\\n\\nSymbolic control analysis is a framework for analysing pathway models in order to reach a mechanistic understanding of their behaviour. By providing algebraic expressions for the sensitivities of system properties, such as metabolic fluxor steady-state concentrations, in terms of the properties of individual reactions it allows one to trace the high level behaviour back to these low level components. Here we apply this method to a model of pyruvate branch metabolism in Lactococcus lactis in order to explain a previously observed negative flux response towards an increase in substrate concentration. With this method we are able to show, first, that the sensitivity of flux towards changes in reaction rates (represented by flux control coefficients) is determined by the individual metabolic branches of the pathway, and second, how the sensitivities of individual reaction rates towards their substrates (represented by elasticity coefficients) contribute to this flux control. We also quantify the contributions of enzyme binding and mass-action to enzyme elasticity separately, which allows for an even finer-grained understanding of flux control.\\n\\nThese analytical tools allow us to analyse the control properties of a metabolic model and to arrive at a mechanistic understanding of the quantitative contributions of each of the enzymes to this control. Our analysis provides an example of the descriptive power of the general principles of symbolic control analysis.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMetabolic networks are complex systems consisting of numerous individual molecular components. The properties of these components, together with their non-linear interactions, give rise to high-level observed behaviour of the system in which they reside. Therefore, in order to fully understand the behaviour of a metabolic system, one has to consider the properties of all of its components. The analysis of computer models that capture and represent these systems and their components simplifies this task by allowing for an easy way to isolate the effects of each individual component. In this paper we use the framework of symbolic control analysis to investigate the sensitivity of the rate of flow of matter through one of the branches in a particular metabolic pathway towards changes in the rates of individual reactions. Here we are able to quantify how certain chains of reactions, individual reactions, and even thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of individual reactions contribute to the overall sensitivity of the rate of matter-flow. Thus, we are able to trace the behaviour of the system as a whole in a mechanistic way to the properties of the individual molecular components.",

    "abstract": "Aneuploidy is associated with many cancers. Recent studies demonstrate that in thehematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment aneuploid cells havereduced fitness and are efficiently purged from the bone marrow. However, early phasesof hematopoietic reconstitution following bone marrow transplantation provide awindow of opportunity whereby aneuploid cells rise in frequency, only to decline to basallevels thereafter. Here we demonstrate by Monte Carlo modeling that two mechanismscould underlie this aneuploidy peak: rapid expansion of the engrafted HSPC populationand bone marrow microenvironment degradation caused by pre-transplantationradiation treatment. Both mechanisms reduce the strength of purifying selection actingin early post-transplantation bone marrow. We explore the contribution of other factorssuch as alterations in cell division rates that affect the strength of purifying selection, thebalance of drift and selection imposed by the HSPC population size, and the mutationselectionbalance dependent on the rate of aneuploidy generation per cell division. Wepropose a somatic evolutionary model for the dynamics of cells with aneuploidy or otherfitness-reducing mutations during hematopoietic reconstitution following bone marrowtransplantation.\\n\\nSignificanceBone marrow transplantations (BMT) following ablative irradiation pose a great health risk. Its been shown that additionally the bone microenvironment is conducive to elevated frequencies of aneuploid cells in mice during bone marrow reconstitution post-BMT. As aneuploidy is linked with many cancers, we explore the reasons of such aberrant cell frequency peaks by Monte Carlo modeling. We demonstrate that elevated rates of aneuploidy early post-BMT are likely to be caused by reduced purifying somatic selection resulting from the expansion of the reconstituting population and the damage to stem cell niches caused by ablative radiation",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality worldwide. Genetic risk loci provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis. To broaden COPD genetic risk loci discovery and identify cell type and phenotype associations we performed a genome-wide association study in 35,735 cases and 222,076 controls from the UK Biobank and additional studies from the International COPD Genetics Consortium. We identified 82 loci with P value < 5x10-8; 47 were previously described in association with either COPD or population-based lung function. Of the remaining 35 novel loci, 13 were associated with lung function in 79,055 individuals from the SpiroMeta consortium. Using gene expression and regulation data, we identified enrichment for loci in lung tissue, smooth muscle and alveolar type II cells. We found 9 shared genomic regions between COPD and asthma and 5 between COPD and pulmonary fibrosis. COPD genetic risk loci clustered into groups of quantitative imaging features and comorbidity associations. Our analyses provide further support to the genetic susceptibility and heterogeneity of COPD.",

    "abstract": "The association between the upregulated Notch and FSH signaling and ovarian cancer is well documented. However, their signaling has been investigated independently and only in the primary tumor tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the interactive effects of FSH and Notch signaling on the ovarian cancer proliferation, formation and maintenance of the disseminated ovarian cancer cells. Roles of Notch and FSH in the ovarian cancer pathogenesis was investigated using ovarian cancer cell lines and specific antibodies against Notch and FSH receptor (FSHR). FSH upregulated Notch signaling and proliferation in the ovarian cancer cells. High levels of FSH were detected in the ascites of patients with serous ovarian adenocarcinoma. The spheroids from the ascites of the patients, as well as, the spheroids from the ovarian cancer cell lines under low attachment culture conditions, expressed FSH{beta} subunit mRNAs and secreted the hormone into the medium. In contrast, the primary ovarian tumor tissues and cell line monolayers expressed very low levels of FSH{beta}. The ovarian cancer cell spheroids also exhibited higher expression of the FSH receptor and Notch downstream genes than their monolayer counterparts. A combination of FSHR and Notch antagonistic antibodies significantly inhibited spheroid formation and cell proliferation in vitro. This study demonstrates that spheroids in ascites express and secrete FSH, which regulates cancer cell proliferation and spheroidogenesis through Notch signaling, suggesting that FSH is an autocrine regulator of cancer metastasis. Further, Notch and FSHR are potential immunotherapeutic targets for ovarian cancer treatment.",

In this study, we have explored its development by studying the canonical Wntsignalling pathway, generating gain and loss of function mutations of betacaten in(Ctnnb1) in both hypothalamic and prethalamic neuroepithelium. Deletion of Ctnnb1 resulted in an anteriorized and hypoplastic hypothalamus. Posterior structures were lost or reduced, and anterior structures were expanded. In contrast, over expression of a constitutively active mutant form of Ctnnb1 resulted in severe hyperplasia of prethalamus and hypothalamus, and expanded expression of a subset of posterior and premamillary hypothalamic markers. Moderate defects in differentiation of Arx-positive GABAergic neural precursors were observed in both prethalamus and hypothalamus of Ctnnb1 loss of function mutants, while in gain of function mutants, their differentiation was completely suppressed, although markers of prethalamic progenitors were preserved. Multiple other region-specific markers, including several specific posterior hypothalamic structures, were also suppressed in Ctnnb1 gain of function mutations. Severe, region-specific defects in hypothalamic nucleogenesis were also observed in both gain and loss of function mutations of Ctnnb1. Finally, both gain and loss of function of Ctnnb1 also produced severe, cell nonautonomous disruptions of pituitary development. These findings demonstrate acentral and multifaceted role for canonical Wnt signalling in regulating growth, patterning, differentiation and nucleogenesis in multiple diencephalic regions.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LICanonical Wnt signalling regulates anteroposterior patterning in the hypothalamus.\\nC_LIO_LICanonical Wnt signalling regulates differentiation of GABAergic neurons in both prethalamus and hypothalamus.\\nC_LIO_LICanonical Wnt signalling regulates differentiation and nucleogenesis of multiple hypothalamic neuronal subtypes.\\nC_LIO_LICanonical Wnt signalling in hypothalamic neuroepithelium regulates pituitary morphogenesis and differentiation.\\nC_LI",

However, DNA cleavage at off-target sites that resemble the target sequence is a pervasive problem that remains poorly understood mechanistically. Here, we use quantitative kinetics to dissect the reaction steps of DNA targeting by Acidaminococcus sp Cas12a (also known as Cpf1). We show that Cas12a binds DNA tightly in two kinetically-separable steps. Protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) recognition is followed by rate-limiting R-loop propagation, leading to inevitable DNA cleavage of both strands. Despite the functionally irreversible binding, Cas12a discriminates strongly against mismatches along most of the DNA target sequence, implying substantial reversibility during R-loop formation -a late transition state- and the absence of a  seed region. Our results provide a quantitative underpinning for the DNA cleavage patterns measured in vivo and observations of greater reported target specificity of Cas12a than the Cas9 nuclease.",

    "abstract": "How cell to cell interactions control local tissue growth to attain a species-specific pattern and organ size is a central question in developmental biology. The Drosophila Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule, Fasciclin 2 (Drosophila NCAM), is expressed during the development of neural and epithelial organs. Genetic mosaic analysis of Fasciclin 2 reveals two complementary and opposing functions during imaginal disc growth, a cell autonomous requirement to promote growth and an opposite non-cell autonomous function to restrain growth at high expression levels. This non-cell autonomous function is mediated by the Fasciclin 2 heterophilic-binding partners CG15630 and CG33543. We show that EGFR physically interacts with Fasciclin 2 and mediates both the cell autonomous and the non-cell autonomous function. We further show that EGFR activity in turn promotes the cell autonomous expression of Fasciclin 2. We suggest that the auto-stimulatory loop between EGFR and Fasciclin 2 operates until reaching a threshold where the Fasciclin 2 non-cell autonomous function counteracts the growth-promoting activity of the homophilic interaction to terminate imaginal disc growth. Accordingly, we have found that Fasciclin 2 limits imaginal disc growth by the end of larval development. Cellular integration of Fasciclin 2 autonomous and non-cell autonomous signaling from neighbor cells may be a key regulator component to orchestrate the rate of intercalary cell proliferation and the final size of an organ.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryOne of the key unsolved problems in Biology is how a species-specific size is attained during animal development. During development cells should compute the amount of intercalary tissue growth to stop cell proliferation when reaching a correct pattern and size. Classic studies demonstrated that local cell interactions are key in controlling organ growth to reach a correct size and pattern in vertebrates and invertebrates. We present evidence strongly suggesting that Fasciclin 2 (the ortholog of NCAM in Drosophila) functions as a growth level switch to control pattern and organ size. First, we use genetic mosaic analyses to show that Fasciclin 2 promotes organ growth in a cell autonomous manner. Then we show that Fasciclin 2 restrains growth at high expression levels in a non-cell autonomous manner, and that there is a requirement for Fasciclin 2 to limit growth by the end of larval development. This function is dependent on Fasciclin 2 heterophilic binding partners CG15630 and CG33543. The Epidermal Growth Factor receptor mediates both functional facets of Fasciclin 2 and its activity in turn increases Fasciclin 2 cell autonomous expression, suggesting the existence of a functional auto-stimulatory loop. We also show that the Epidermal Growth Factor receptor and Fasciclin 2 physically interact. Our results show that the amount of Fasciclin 2 between cells determines organ size by acting as an expression level switch for EGFR function, and suggest that other specific CAM interactions may integrate similar expression level switches acting as a code for cells to compute local growth in attaining a species-specific organ size and shape.",

    "abstract": "Orthologs diverge after lineage separation events and paralogs after gene duplications. Thus, orthologs are expected to remain more functionally coherent across lineages, while paralogs have been proposed as a source of new functions. Because protein functional divergence follows from non-synonymous substitutions, we performed an analysis based on the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS), as proxy for functional divergence. We used five working definitions of orthology, including reciprocal best hits (RBH), among other definitions based on network analyses and clustering. The results showed that orthologs, by all definitions tested, had values of dN/dS noticeably lower than those of paralogs, suggesting that, as a group, orthologs tend to be more functionally stable than paralogs. The differences in dN/dS ratios remained suggesting the functional stability of orthologs after eliminating gene comparisons with potential problems, such as genes with high codon usage biases, low coverage of either of the aligned sequences, or sequences with very high similarities. Separation by percent identity of the encoded proteins showed that the differences between the dN/dS ratios of orthologs and paralogs were more evident at high sequence identity, less so as identity dropped. While the last results partially explained the differences between dN/dS ratios of the two groups as being related to differences in protein identity, they also suggested that paralogs undergo functional divergence relatively early after duplication. Our analyses indicate that choosing orthologs as probably functionally coherent remains the right approach in comparative genomics.",

Only 10-20% of patients are eligible for surgery, and over 50% of these will die within a year of surgery. Identify molecular predictors of early death would enable the selection of PDAC patients at high risk.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed the Pancreatic Cancer Overall Survival Predictor (PCOSP), a prognostic model built from a unique set of 89 PDAC tumors where gene expression was profiled using both microarray and sequencing platforms. We used a meta-analysis framework based on the binary gene pair method to create gene expression barcodes robust to biases arising from heterogeneous profiling platforms and batch effects. Leveraging the largest compendium of PDAC transcriptomic datasets to date, we show that PCOSP is a robust single-sample predictor of early death ([&le;]1 yr) after surgery in a subset of 823 samples with available transcriptomics and survival data.\\n\\nResultsThe PCOSP model was strongly and significantly prognostic with a meta-estimate of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.70 (P=1.9e-18) and hazard ratio (HR) of 1.95(1.6-2.3) (P=2.6e-16) for binary and survival predictions, respectively. The prognostic value of PCOSP was independent of clinicopathological parameters and molecular subtypes. Over-representation analysis of the PCOSP 2619 gene-pairs (1070 unique genes) unveiled pathways associated with Hedgehog signalling, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and extracellular matrix (ECM) signalling.\\n\\nConclusionPCOSP could improve treatment decision by identifying patients who will not benefit from standard surgery/chemotherapy and may benefit from alternate approaches.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Exosomes and exosome-like vesicles participate in cell-to-cell communication in animals, plant and bacteria. Dietary exosomes in bovine milk are bioavailable in non-bovine species, but a fraction of milk exosomes reaches the large intestine. We hypothesized that milk exosomes alter the composition of the gut microbiome in mice. C57BL/6 mice were fed AIN-93G diets, defined by their content of bovine milk exosomes and RNA cargos: exosome/RNA depleted (ERD) versus exosome/RNA-sufficient (ERS) diets. Feeding was initiated at age three weeks and cecum content was collected at ages 7, 15 and 47 weeks. Microbial communities were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The dietary intake of exosomes and age had significant effects on the microbial communities in the cecum. At the phylum level, the abundance of Verrucomicrobia was greater in mice fed ERD compared to ERS, and the abundance of both Firmicutes and Tenericutes was smaller in mice fed ERD compared to ERS at age 47 weeks. At the family level, the abundance of Anaeroplasmataceae was greater in mice fed ERD compared to ERS, and the abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Dehalobacteriaceae was significantly greater in mice fed ERS than mice fed ERD at age 15 weeks. Exosome feeding significantly altered the abundance of 52 operational taxonomic units; diet effects were particularly strong in the Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and the Verrucomicrobiaceae families. We conclude that exosomes in bovine milk alter microbial communities in non-bovine species, suggesting that exosomes and their cargos participate in the crosstalk between bacterial and animal kingdoms.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEVirtually all living cells, including bacteria communicate through exosomes, which can be found in all body fluids. Exosomes and the RNA cargos have been implicated in all aspects of health and disease, e.g., metastasis of cancer, neuronal signaling and embryonic development. Previously, we reported that exosomes and their microRNA cargos are not solely derived from endogenous synthesis, but may also be obtained from dietary sources such as bovine milk in non-bovine mammals. Here, we report for the first time that bovine milk exosomes communicate with the intestinal microbiome and alters microbial communities in mice. This is the first report suggesting that the gut microbiome facilitates the signaling by dietary exosomes across kingdoms: animal (cow) [-&gt;] bacteria [-&gt;] animal (mouse).",

    "abstract": "Plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) have a remarkable capacity to generate long duration advertisement calls known as hums, each of which may last for close to two hours and be repeated throughout a night of courtship activity during the breeding season. The midshipmans striking sound production capabilities provide a unique opportunity to investigate the mechanisms that motor neurons require for withstanding high-endurance activity. The temporal properties of midshipman vocal behaviors are largely controlled by a hindbrain central pattern generator that includes vocal motor neurons (VMN) that directly determine the activity pattern of target sonic muscles and, in turn, a sounds pulse repetition rate, duration and pattern of amplitude modulation. Of the two adult midshipman male reproductive phenotypes -- types I and II-- only type I males acoustically court females with hums from nests that they build and guard, while type II males do not produce courtship hums but instead sneak or satellite spawn to steal fertilizations from type I males. A prior study using next generation RNA sequencing showed increased expression of a number of cellular respiration and antioxidant genes in the VMN of type I males during the breeding season, suggesting they help to combat potentially high levels of oxidative stress linked to this extreme behavior. This led to the question of whether the expression of these genes in the VMN would vary between actively humming versus non-humming states as well as between male morphs. Here, we tested the hypothesis that to combat oxidative stress, the VMN of reproductively active type I males would exhibit higher mRNA transcript levels for two superoxide dismutases (sod1, sod2) compared to the VMN of type II males and females that do not hum and in general both of which have a more limited vocal repertoire than type I males. The results showed no significant difference in sod1 transcript expression across reproductive morphs in the VMN and the surrounding hindbrain, and no difference of sod2 across the two male morphs and females in the SH. However, we observed a surprising, significantly lower expression of sod2 transcripts in the VMN of type I males as compared to type II males. We also found no significant difference in sod1 and sod2 expression between actively humming and non-humming type I males in both the VMN and surrounding hindbrain. These findings overall lead us to conclude that increased transcription of sod1 and sod2 is not necessary for combatting oxidative stress from the demands of the midshipman high-endurance vocalizations, but warrant future studies to assess protein levels, enzyme activity levels, as well as the expression of other antioxidant genes. These results also eliminate one of the proposed mechanisms that male midshipman use to combat potentially high levels of oxidative stress incurred by motor neurons driving long duration vocalization and provide more insight into how motor neurons are adapted to the performance of extreme behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Preterm infant brain activity is discontinuous; bursts of activity recorded using EEG (electroencephalography), thought to be driven by subcortical regions, display scale free properties and exhibit a complex temporal ordering known as long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). During brain development, activity-dependent mechanisms are essential for synaptic connectivity formation, and abolishing burst activity in animal models leads to weak disorganised synaptic connectivity. Moreover, synaptic pruning shares similar mechanisms to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), suggesting that the timing of activity may play a critical role in connectivity formation. We investigated, in a computational model of leaky integrate-and-fire neurones, whether the temporal ordering of burst activity within an external driving input could modulate connectivity formation in the network. Connectivity evolved across the course of simulations using an approach analogous to STDP, from networks with initial random connectivity. Small-world connectivity and hub neurones emerged in the network structure - characteristic properties of mature brain networks. Notably, driving the network with an external input which exhibited LRTCs in the temporal ordering of burst activity facilitated the emergence of these network properties, increasing the speed with which they emerged compared with when the network was driven by the same input with the bursts randomly ordered in time. Moreover, the emergence of small-world properties was dependent on the strength of the LRTCs. These results suggest that the temporal ordering of burst activity could play an important role in synaptic connectivity formation and the emergence of small-world topology in the developing brain.",

    "abstract": "DNA damage provokes mutations and cancer, and results from external carcinogens or endogenous cellular processes. Yet, the intrinsic instigators of DNA damage are poorly understood. Here we identify proteins that promote endogenous DNA damage when overproduced: the DNA-damaging proteins (DDPs). We discover a large network of DDPs in Escherichia coli and deconvolute them into six DNA-damage-causing function clusters, demonstrating DDP mechanisms in three: reactive-oxygen increase by transmembrane transporters, chromosome loss by replisome binding, and replication stalling by transcription factors. Their 284 human homologs are over-represented among known cancer drivers, and their expression in tumors predicts heavy mutagenesis and poor prognosis. Half of tested human homologs, when overproduced in human cells, promote DNA damage and mutation, with DNA-damaging mechanisms like those in E. coli. Together, our work reveals DDP networks that provoke endogenous DNA damage and may indicate functions of many human known and newly implicated cancer-promoting proteins.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTAlthough dynamics of the complex microbial ecosystem populating the gastrointestinal tract of animals has profound and multifaceted impacts on hosts metabolism and health, it remains unclear whether it is the intrinsic or extrinsic factors that play a more dominant role in mediating variations in the composition of intestinal microbiota. To address this, two strikingly different diets were studied: a high-protein, low-fiber formula feed (FF), and low-protein, high-fiber Sudan grass (SG). After a 16-week feeding trial on a herbivorous fish, grass carp, microbial profiles of midgut (M) and hindgut (H) segments of both groups were compared. Bacteroidetes were more abundant in the hindgut (T=-7.246, p<0.001), and Proteobacteria in the midgut (T=4.383, p<0.001). Fusobacteria were more abundant in the FF group (compared to the SG group, T=2.927, p<0.001). Bacterial composition was different (p<0.05) between the midguts of formula feed (M-FF) and Sudan grass (M-SG) groups, but not between the hindguts of two groups (H-FF and H-SG; p=0.269). PerMANOVA and VPA indicated that the gut segment contributed 19.8% (p<0.001) and 28% (p<0.001) of the variation of microbial communities, whereas diet contributed only 8.0% (p<0.001) and 14% (p<0.001), respectively. Overall, results suggest that intestinal compartments are a stronger determinant than diet in shaping the intestinal microbiota. Specifically, whereas diet has a strong impact on the microbiome composition in proximal gut compartments, this impact is much less pronounced distally, which is likely to be a reflection of a limited ability of some microbial taxa to thrive in the anoxic environment in distal segments.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe impact of compositional dynamics of gut microbiota on hosts metabolism and health is so profound that the traditional idea of biological individual is increasingly replaced with \\\"holobiont\\\", comprising both the host and its microbiome. Composition of gut microbiota is strongly influenced by extrinsic (such as diet) and intrinsic (such as gut compartment) factors. Despite ample scientific attention both of these factors have received individually, their relative contributions in mediating the dynamics of the microbiome remain unknown. Given the importance of this issue, we set out to disentangle their individual contributions in a herbivorous fish, grass carp. We found that intestinal compartments are a stronger determinant than diet in shaping the intestinal microbiota. Whereas the impact of diet is strongly pronounced in proximal gut compartments, it appears that limited ability of some microbial taxa to thrive in the anoxic environment in distal segments strongly reduces the impact of diet distally.",

    "abstract": "Male and female unisexual flowers have repeatedly evolved from the ancestral bisexual flowers in different lineages of flowering plants. This sex specialization in different flowers often occurs within inflorescences. We hypothesize that inflorescence architecture may impose a constraint on resource availability for late flowers, potentially leading to different optima in floral sex allocation and unisexuality. Under this hypothesis we expect that inflorescence traits increasing the difference in resource availability between early and late flowers would be phylogenetically correlated with a higher level of sexual specialization. To test this hypothesis, we performed a comparative analysis of inflorescence traits (inflorescence size, number of flowers and flower density) in the sunflower family, which displays an extraordinary variation in floral sexual specialization at the inflorescence level, i.e. hermaphroditic, gynomonoecious and monoecious species. We found that species with a complete sex separation in unisexual flowers (monoecy) had significantly denser inflorescences. Furthermore, those species arranging their flowers in denser inflorescences also showed greater differences in the size of early and late fruits, a proxy of resource variation between flowers. Our findings support the idea that floral sexual specialization and consequently sexual segregation may be the consequence of different floral sex allocation optima driven by the sequential development of flowers that results in a persistent resource decline from earlier to later flowers.",

It is regarded either as a parthenogenetic form of slough crayfish Procambarus fallax or as a separate species named Procambarus virginalis. In order to investigate the species question of this unusual crayfish in detail we have identified the similarities and differences in morphology, life history, genetics, behaviour, ecology and biogeography between marbled crayfish and its most likely parent species P. fallax. We have investigated specimens from natural habitats, laboratory colonies and museum collections and performed a meta-analysis of our data and published data. Our COI based molecular tree with 27 Cambaridae confirms closest relationship of marbled crayfish with P. fallax. Marbled crayfish and P. fallax are similar with respect to morphological characters, coloration and body proportions, but differ considerably with respect to body size, fertility and longevity. The mitochondrial genes of both crayfish are similar, but ploidy level and haploid genome size are markedly different. Both crayfish are eurytopic and have two major annual recruitment periods, but marbled crayfish show different population structure and higher invasiveness. Marbled crayfish occur in tropical to cold temperate habitats of the old world, but P. fallax is confined to subtropical and warm-temperate habitats of the southeastern USA. Cross-breeding experiments with both crayfish revealed reproductive isolation. The application of the Evolutionary Genetic Species Concept for asexuals to all available data supports raising marbled crayfish from \\\"forma\\\" to species rank.

Using purified mammalian F1Fo-reconstituted proteoliposomes and isolated mitochondria, we show that F1Fo utilizes both H+- and K+-transport (because of >106-fold K+ excess vs H+) to drive ATP synthesis with the H+:K+ permeability of ~106:1. F1Fo can be upregulated by endogenous survival-related proteins (Bcl-xL, Mcl-1) and synthetic molecules (diazoxide, pinacidil) to increase its chemo-mechanical efficiency via IF1. Increasing K+- and H+-driven ATP synthesis enables F1Fo to operate as a primary mitochondrial K+-uniporter regulating energy supply-demand matching, and as the recruitable mitochondrial KATP-channel that can limit ischemia-reperfusion injury. Isolated mitochondria in the presence of K+ can sustain ~3.5-fold higher ATP-synthesis-flux (vs K+ absence) driven by a 2.7:1 K+:H+ stoichiometry with unaltered OxPhos coupling. Excellent agreement between F1Fo single-molecule and intact-mitochondria experiments is consistent with K+-transport through ATP synthase driving a major fraction of ATP synthesis.",

MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Informit databases were searched using key words. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and then full-text papers against inclusion criteria according to PRISMA guidelines.\\n\\nResultsTwenty-five papers considering indigenous Australian, Alaskan and Greenlandic children were included. There were high rates of nasopharyngeal colonization with the three main otopathogens (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) in indigenous children with OM. Middle ear samples had lower rates of otopathogen detection, although detection rates increased when molecular methods were used. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were commonly detected in middle ear discharge of children with chronic suppurative OM. There was significant heterogeneity between studies, particularly in microbiological methods, which were largely limited to culture-based detection of the main otopathogens.\\n\\nConclusionsThere are high rates of otopathogen colonization in indigenous children with OM. Chronic suppurative OM appears to be associated with a different microbial profile. Beyond the main otopathogens, the data are limited. Further research is required to explore the entire upper respiratory tract/ middle ear microbiota in relation to OM, with the inclusion of healthy indigenous peers as controls.",

    "abstract": "Natural competence for transformation is a widely used and key mode of horizontal gene transfer that can foster rapid bacterial evolution. Competent bacteria take-up DNA from their environment using Type IV pili, a widespread and multi-purpose class of cell surface polymers. However, how pili facilitate DNA-uptake has remained unclear. Here, using direct labelling, we show that in the Gram-negative pathogen Vibrio cholerae DNA-uptake pili are highly dynamic and that they retract prior to DNA-uptake. Unexpectedly, these pili can self-interact to mediate auto-aggregation of cells into macroscopic structures. This phenotype is conserved in disease causing pandemic strains. However, extensive strain-to-strain variability in the major pilin subunit PilA, present in environmental isolates, controls the ability of pili to interact without affecting transformation. We go on to show that interactions between pili are highly specific, enabling cells producing pili composed of different PilA subunits to discriminate between one another. On chitin surfaces, a natural habitat of V. cholerae, pili connect cells within dense networks, suggesting a model whereby DNA-uptake pili function to promote inter-bacterial interactions during surface colonisation. Moreover, our results provide evidence that type IV pili could provide a simple and potentially widespread mechanism for bacterial kin recognition.",

    "abstract": "Learning new skills by watching others is important for social and motor development throughout the lifespan. Prior research has suggested that observational learning shares common substrates with physical practice at both cognitive and brain levels. In addition, neuroimaging studies have used multivariate analysis techniques to understand neural representations in a variety of domains including vision, audition, memory and action, but few studies have investigated neural plasticity in representational space. As such, although movement sequences can be learned by observing other peoples actions, a largely unanswered question in neuroscience is how experience shapes the representational space of neural systems. Here we combined pre- and post-training fMRI sessions with six days of observational practice to examine whether the observation of action sequences elicits sequence-specific representations in frontoparietal brain regions and the extent to which these representations become more pronounced with observational practice. Our results showed that observed action sequences are modelled by distinct patterns of activity in frontoparietal cortex and that such representations largely generalise to very similar, but untrained, sequences. These findings advance our understanding of what is modelled during observational learning (sequence-specific information), as well as how it is modelled (reorganisation of frontoparietal cortex is similar manner to that of physical practice). Thus, on a more fine-grained neural level than demonstrated previously, we show the representational structure of how frontoparietal cortex maps visual information onto motor circuits to order to enhance motor performance.\\n\\nSignificance statementLearning by watching others is a cornerstone in the development of expertise and skilled behaviour.

    "abstract": "Systemic light chain amyloidosis (AL) is a disease caused by overexpression of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains that form pathogenic amyloid fibrils. These amyloid fibrils deposit in tissues and cause organ failure. Proteins form amyloid fibrils when they partly or fully unfold and expose segments capable of stacking into {beta}-sheets that pair forming a tight, dehydrated interface. These structures, termed steric zippers, constitute the spines of amyloid fibrils. Here, we identify segments within the variable domains of Ig light chains that drive the assembly of amyloid fibrils in AL. We demonstrate there are at least two such segments. Each one can drive amyloid fibril assembly independently of the other. Thus these two segments are therapeutic targets. In addition to elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of AL, these findings also provide an experimental approach to identify segments that drive fibril formation in other amyloid diseases.",

    "abstract": "Genotype-phenotype mapping is one of the fundamental challenges in biology. The difficulties stem in part from the large amount of sequence information and the puzzling genomic code, particularly of non-protein-coding regions such as gene regulatory sequences. However, recently deep learning-based methods were shown to have the ability to decipher the gene regulatory code of genomes. Still, prediction accuracy needs improvement. Here, we report the design of convolution layers that efficiently process genomic sequence information and developed a software, DeepGMAP, to train and compare different deep learning-based models (https://github.com/koonimaru/DeepGMAP). First, we demonstrate that our convolution layers, termed forward- and reverse-sequence scan (FRSS) layers, enhance the power to predict gene regulatory sequences. Second, we assessed previous studies and identified problems associated with data structures that caused overfitting.

    "abstract": "Multicellular organisms appeared on Earth through several independent major evolutionary transitions. Are such transitions reversible? Addressing this fundamental question entails understanding the benefits and costs of multicellularity versus unicellularity. For example, some wild yeast strains form multicellular clumps, which might be beneficial in stressful conditions, but this has been untested. Here we show that unicellular yeast evolves from clump-forming ancestors by propagating samples from suspension after larger clumps have settled. Unicellular yeast strains differed from their clumping ancestors mainly by mutations in the AMN1 (Antagonist of Mitotic exit Network) gene. Ancestral yeast clumps were more resistant to freeze/thaw, hydrogen peroxide, and ethanol stressors than their unicellular counterparts, while unicellularity was advantageous without stress. These findings inform mathematical models, jointly suggesting a trade-off between the benefits and downsides of multicellularity, causing bet-hedging by regulated phenotype switching as a survival strategy in unexpected stress.",

    "abstract": "Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are often measured to non-invasively determine activation of medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferents in humans. Usually these experiments assume that ear-canal noise remains constant. However, changes in ear-canal noise have been reported in some behavioral experiments. We studied the variability of ear-canal noise in eight subjects who performed a two-interval-forced-choice (2IFC) sound-level-discrimination task on monaural tone pips in masking noise. Ear-canal noise was recorded directly from the unstimulated ear opposite the task ear. Recordings were also done with similar sounds presented, but no task done. In task trials, ear-canal noise was reduced at the time the subject did the discrimination, relative to the noise level earlier in the trial. In two subjects, there was a decrease in ear-canal noise, primarily at 1-2 kHz, with a time course similar to that expected from inhibition by MOC activity elicited by the task-ear masker noise. These were the only subjects with spontaneous OAEs (SOAEs). We hypothesize that the SOAEs were inhibited by MOC activity elicited by the task-ear masker. Based on the standard rationale in OAE experiments that large bursts of noise are artifacts due to subject movement, noise bursts above a sound-level criterion were removed. As the criterion was lowered and more high-and moderate-level noise bursts were removed, the reduction in noise level from the beginning of the trial to the time of the 2IFC discrimination became less. This pattern is opposite that expected from MOC inhibition (which is greater on lower-level sounds), but can be explained by the hypothesis that subjects move less and create fewer bursts of noise when they concentrate on doing the task. In contrast, for the six subjects with no SOAEs, in no-task trials the noise level was little changed throughout the trial. Our results show that measurements of MOC effects on OAEs must measure and account for changes in ear-canal noise, especially in behavioral experiments. The results also provide a novel way of showing the time course of the buildup of attention in ear-canal noise during a 2IFC task.",

Are these recurrent circuits critical to ventral streams execution of this behavior? We reasoned that, if recurrence is critical, then primates should outperform feedforward-only DCNNs for some images, and that these images should require additional processing time beyond the feedforward IT response. Here we first used behavioral methods to discover hundreds of these \\\"challenge\\\" images. Second, using large-scale IT electrophysiology in animals performing core recognition tasks, we observed that behaviorally-sufficient, linearly-decodable object identity solutions emerged ~30ms (on average) later in IT for challenge images compared to DCNN and primate performance-matched \\\"control\\\" images. We observed these same late solutions even during passive viewing. Third, consistent with a failure of feedforward computations, the behaviorally-critical late-phase IT population response patterns evoked by the challenge images were poorly predicted by DCNN activations. Interestingly, deeper CNNs better predicted these late IT responses, suggesting a functional equivalence between recurrence and additional nonlinear transformations. Our results argue that automatically-evoked recurrent circuits are critical even for rapid object identification. By precisely comparing current DCNNs, primate behavior and IT population dynamics, we provide guidance for future recurrent model development.",

As economic and political pressures impacting these enterprises continue to change, the postdoc experience has evolved from short, focused periods of training into often multidisciplinary, extended positions with less clear outcomes.

Here we present comprehensive survey results from over 7,600 postdocs based at 351 academic and non-academic U.S. institutions in 2016. In addition to demographic and salary information, we present multivariate analyses on the factors that influence postdoc career plans and mentorship satisfaction in this population. We further analyze gender dynamics and expose wage disparities and career choice differences. Academic research positions remain the predominant career choice of postdocs in the U.S., although unequally between postdocs based on gender and residency status. Receiving mentorship training during the postdoctoral period has a large, positive effect on postdoc mentorship satisfaction. Strikingly, the quality of and satisfaction with postdoc mentorship appears to also heavily influence career choice. The data presented here are the most comprehensive data on the U.S. postdoc population to date.

However, it is unclear if animals will put more effort into changing their signals that spectrally overlap more with the interfering sounds than when the signals overlap less. We examined the dynamic changes in the temporal features of echolocation and communication vocalizations of the Asian particolored bat (Vespertilio sinensis) when exposed to traffic noise. We hypothesized that traffic noise has a greater impact on communication vocalizations than on echolocation vocalizations and predicted that communication vocalization change would be greater than echolocation. The bats started to adjust echolocation vocalizations on the fourth day of noise exposure, including an increased number of call sequences, decreased number of calls, and vocal rate within a call sequence. However, there was little change in the duration of the call sequence. In contrast, these communication vocalization features were not significantly adjusted under noise conditions. These findings suggest that the degree of spectral overlap between noise and animal acoustic signals does not predict the level of temporal vocal response to the noise.",

The \\\"skyline plot\\\" and related approaches are commonly employed as exible prior distributions for phylogenetic trees in the Bayesian analysis of pathogen gene sequences. In this work we extend the classic and generalised skyline plot methods to phylogenies that contain one or more multifurcations (i.e. hard polytomies). We use the theory of {Lambda}-coalescents (specifically, Beta(2,)-coalescents) to develop the \\\"multifurcating skyline plot\\\", which estimates a piecewise constant function of effective population size through time, conditional on a time-scaled multifurcating phylogeny. We implement a smoothing procedure and extend the method to serially-sampled (heterochronous) data, but we do not address here the problem of estimating trees with multifurcations from gene sequence alignments. We validate our estimator on simulated data using maximum likelihood and find that parameters of the Beta(2,)-coalescent process can be estimated accurately. Lastly we apply the multifurcating skyline plot to a molecular clock phylogeny of 1,610 Ebola virus sequences from the 2014-2016 West African outbreak. We artificially collapse short branches in this empirical phylogeny in order to mimic different levels of multifurcation and show that variance in the reproductive success of the pathogen through time can be estimated by combining the skyline plot with epidemiological case count data.",

    "abstract": "The Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1 virus persists in many countries and has been circulating in poultry, wild birds. In addition, the virus has emerged in other species and frequent zoonotic spillover events indicate that there remains a significant risk to human health. It is crucial to understand the dynamics of the disease in the poultry industry to develop a more comprehensive knowledge of the risks of transmission and to establish a better distribution of resources when implementing control. In this paper, we develop a set of mathematical models that simulate the spread of HPAI H5N1 in the poultry industry in Thailand, utilising data from the 2004 epidemic. The model that incorporates the intensity of duck farming when assessing transmision risk provides the best fit to the spatiotemporal characteristics of the observed outbreak, implying that intensive duck farming drives transmission of HPAI in Thailand. We also extend our models using a sequential model fitting approach to explore the ability of the models to be used in \\\"real time\\\" during novel disease outbreaks. We conclude that, whilst predictions of epidemic size are estimated poorly in the early stages of disease outbreaks, the model accurately predicts the preferred control policy that should be deployed to minimise the impact of the disease.",

In this study, for the first time, we aimed to develop a spatiotemporal LUR model using Distributed Space Time Expectation Maximization (D-STEM). This spatiotemporal LUR model examined with daily particulate matter [&le;] 2.5 m (PM2.5) within the megacity of Tehran, capital of Iran. Moreover, D-STEM missing data imputation was compared with mean substitution in each monitoring station, as it is equivalent to ignoring of missing data, which is common in LUR studies that employ regulatory monitoring stations data. The amount of missing data was 28% of the total number of observations, in Tehran in 2015. The annual mean of PM2.5 concentrations was 33 g/m3. Spatiotemporal R-squared of the D-STEM final daily LUR model was 78%, and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) R-squared was 66%. Spatial R-squared and LOOCV R-squared were 89% and 72%, respectively. Temporal R-squared and LOOCV R-squared were 99.5% and 99.3%, respectively. Mean absolute error decreased 26% in imputation of missing data by using the D-STEM final LUR model instead of mean substitution. This study reveals competence of the D-STEM software in spatiotemporal missing data imputation, estimation of temporal trend, and mapping of small scale (20 x 20 meters) within-city spatial variations, in the LUR context. The estimated PM2.5 concentrations maps could be used in future studies on short- and/or long-term health effects.

These models assume that the dynamics of malaria can most simply be characterized by two equations that describe the prevalence of malaria in the human and mosquito hosts. This structure has formed the central core of models for malaria and most other vector-borne diseases for the last century with occasional additions acknowledging important aetiological details. We partially add to this tradition by describing a malaria model that provides for vital dynamics in the vector and the possibility of super-infection in the human host; reinfection of asymptomatic hosts before they have cleared a prior infection. These key features of malaria aetiology create the potential for break points in the prevalence of infected hosts, sudden transitions that seem to characterize malarias response to control in different locations. We show that this potential for critical transitions is a general and underappreciated feature of any model for vector borne diseases with incomplete immunity and asymptomatic patients, including the canonical Ross-McDonald model. Ignoring these details of the hosts immune response to infection can potentially lead to serious misunderstanding in the interpretation of malaria distribution patterns and the design of control schemes for other vector-borne diseases.",

Here we investigate the dynamics of resistance fixation in a bacterial population with variable mutation rates and show that evolutionary outcomes are most sensitive to mutation rate variations when the population is subject to environmental and demographic conditions that suppress the evolutionary advantage of high-fitness subpopulations. By directly mapping a molecular-level biophysical fitness function to the system-level dynamics of the population we show that both low and very high, but not intermediate, levels of stress result in a disproportionate effect of hypermutation on resistance fixation and that traditional definitions of the selection coefficient are insufficient to account for this effect. We demonstrate how this behavior is directly tied to the extent of genetic hitchhiking in the system, the propagation of high-mutation rate cells through association with high-fitness mutations. Our results indicate a substantial role for mutation rate flexibility in the evolution of antibiotic resistance under conditions that present a weak advantage over wildtype to resistant cells.",

    "abstract": "Rodent-to-human transmission of hantaviruses is associated with severe disease. Currently, no FDA-approved, specific antivirals or vaccines are available, and the requirement for high biocontainment (BSL3) laboratories limits hantavirus research. To study hantavirus entry in a BSL-2 laboratory, we set out to generate replication-competent, recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSVs) bearing the Gn/Gc entry glycoproteins. As previously reported, rVSVs bearing New World hantavirus Gn/Gc were readily rescued from cDNAs, but their counterparts bearing Gn/Gc from the Old World hantavirus, Hantaan virus (HTNV), were refractory to rescue and only grew to low titers. However, serial passage of the rescued rVSV-HTNV Gn/Gc virus markedly increased its infectivity and capacity for cell-to-cell spread. This gain in viral fitness was associated with the acquisition of two point mutations; I532K in the cytoplasmic tail of Gn, and S1094L in the membrane-proximal stem of Gc. Follow-up experiments with rVSVs and single-cycle VSV pseudotypes confirmed these results. Mechanistic studies revealed that both mutations were determinative and contributed to viral infectivity in a synergistic manner. Our findings indicate that the primary mode of action of these mutations is to relocalize HTNV Gn/Gc from the Golgi complex to the cell surface, thereby affording significantly enhanced Gn/Gc incorporation into budding VSV particles. Our results suggest that enhancements in cell-surface expression of hantaviral glycoprotein(s) through incorporation of cognate mutations could afford the generation of rVSVs that are otherwise challenging to rescue. The robust replication-competent rVSV-HTNV Gn/Gc reported herein may also have utility as a vaccine.\\n\\nImportanceHuman hantavirus infections cause pulmonary syndrome in the Americas and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia. No FDA-approved vaccines and therapeutics exist for these deadly viruses, and their development is limited by the requirement for high biocontainment. In this study, we identified and characterized key amino acid changes in the surface glycoproteins of HFRS-causing Hantaan virus that enhance their incorporation into recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) particles. The replication-competent rVSV genetically encoding Hantaan virus glycoproteins described in this work provides a powerful and facile system to study hantavirus entry under lower biocontainment and may have utility as a hantavirus vaccine.",

    "abstract": "Rapid task-related plasticity is a neural correlate of selective attention in primary auditory cortex (A1). Top-down feedback from higher-order cortex may drive task-related plasticity in A1, characterized by enhanced neural representation of behaviorally meaningful sounds during auditory task performance. Since intracortical connectivity is greater within A1 layers 2/3 (L2/3) than in layers 4-6 (L4-6), we hypothesized that enhanced representation of behaviorally meaningful sounds might be greater in A1 L2/3 than L4-6. To test this hypothesis and study the laminar profile of task-related plasticity, we trained 2 ferrets to detect pure tones while we recorded laminar activity across a 1.8 mm depth in A1. In each experiment, we analyzed current-source densities (CSDs), high-gamma local field potentials (LFPs), and multi-unit spiking in response to identical acoustic stimuli during both passive listening and active task performance. We found that neural responses to auditory targets were enhanced during task performance, and target enhancement was greater in L2/3 than in L4-6. Spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) computed from CSDs, high-gamma LFPs, and multi-unit spiking showed similar increases in auditory target selectivity, also greatest in L2/3. Our results suggest that activity within intracortical networks plays a key role in shaping the underlying neural mechanisms of selective attention.",

    "abstract": "Behavior and physiology are orchestrated by neuropeptides acting as neuromodulators and/or circulating hormones. A central question is how these neuropeptides function to coordinate complex and competing behaviors. The neuropeptide leucokinin (LK) modulates diverse functions, including circadian rhythms, feeding, water homeostasis, and sleep, but the mechanisms underlying these complex interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we delineate the LK circuitry that governs homeostatic functions that are critical for survival. We found that impaired LK signaling affects diverse but coordinated processes, including regulation of stress, water homeostasis, locomotor activity, and metabolic rate. There are three different sets of LK neurons, which contribute to different aspects of this physiology. We show that the calcium activity of abdominal ganglia LK neurons (ABLKs) increases specifically following water consumption, but not under other conditions, suggesting that these neurons regulate water homeostasis and its associated physiology. To identify targets of LK peptide, we mapped the distribution of the LK receptor (Lkr), mined brain single-cell transcriptome dataset for genes coexpressed with Lkr, and utilized trans-synaptic labeling to identify synaptic partners of LK neurons. Lkr expression in the brain insulin-producing cells (IPCs), gut, renal tubules and sensory cells, and the post-synaptic signal in sensory neurons, correlates well with regulatory roles detected in the Lk and Lkr mutants. Furthermore, these mutants and flies with targeted knockdown of Lkr in IPCs displayed altered expression of insulin-like peptides (DILPs) in IPCs and modulated stress responses. Thus, some effects of LK signaling appear to occur via DILP action. Collectively, our data suggest that the three sets of LK neurons orchestrate the establishment of post-prandial homeostasis by regulating distinct physiological processes and behaviors such as diuresis, metabolism, organismal activity and insulin signaling. These findings provide a platform for investigating neuroendocrine regulation of behavior and brain-to-periphery communication.",

    "abstract": "SYNGAP1, a Synaptic Ras-GTPase activating protein, regulates synapse maturation during a critical developmental window. Heterozygous mutation in SYNGAP1 (SYNGAP1+/-) has been shown to cause Intellectual Disability (ID) in children. Recent studies have provided evidence for altered neuronal protein synthesis in a mouse model of Syngap1+/-. However, the molecular mechanisms behind the same is unclear. Here, we report the reduced expression of a known translation regulator, FMRP, during a specific developmental period in Syngap1+/- mice. Our results demonstrated that FMRP interacts with and regulates the translation of Syngap1 mRNA. We further show that, during development, reduced translation of FMRP and this decrease in FMRP leads to a compensatory increase of Syngap1 translation in Syngap1+/-. These developmental changes are reflected in the altered response of eEF2 phosphorylation downstream of NMDA receptor signalling. We propose a cross-talk between FMRP and SYNGAP1 mediated signalling which can also explain the compensatory effect of impaired signalling observed in Syngap1+/- mice.",

    "abstract": "Recreational use of concentrated oxygen has increased. Claims have been made that hyperoxic breathing can help reduce fatigue, increase alertness, and improve attentional capacities; however, few systematic studies of these potential benefits exist. Here we examined the effects of short-term (15 minute) hyperoxia on resting-states in awake human subjects by measuring spontaneous EEG activity between normoxic and hyperoxic situations, using a within-subjects design for both eyes-opened and eyes-closed conditions. We also measured respiration rate, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation levels to correlate basic physiological changes due to the hyperoxic challenge with any brain activity changes. Our results show that breathing short term 100% oxygen led to increased blood-oxygen saturation levels, decreased heart rate, and a slight, but non-significant, decrease in breathing rate. Changes of brain activity were apparent, including decreases in low-alpha (7-10 Hz), high-alpha (10-14 Hz), beta (14-30 Hz), and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequency ranges during eyes-opened hyperoxic conditions. During eyes-closed hyperoxia, increases in the delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) and theta (3.5-7 Hz) frequency range were apparent together with decreases in the beta range. Hyperoxia appeared to accentuate the decrease of low alpha and gamma ranges across the eyes-opened and closed conditions suggesting that it modulated brain state itself. As decreased alpha during eyes-opened conditions has been associated with increased attentional processing and selective attention, and increased delta and theta during eyes-closed condition are typically associated with the initiation of sleep, our results suggest a state-specific and perhaps opposing influence of short-term hyperoxia.",

Four 1-year old rhesus macaques were aerosol challenged with B. pertussis at the concentration of 105 CFU/mL for 30 min (group 1) or 60 min (group 2). Rectal temperature was found slightly increased at days 3 and 5 and returned to baseline levels at day 21 after challenge. White blood cell counts peaked at day 7, with a 4.7~6.1-fold increase and returned to baseline levels at day 45. Bacteria colonization of nasopharyngeal swabs was observed, and the number of colonies was gradually increased and peaked at day 14, reaching 5.4-8.1 x 106/mL. The seroconversion rate of anti-pertussis toxin (PT), pertactin (PRN), and filamentous hemagglutinin(FHA) antibodies was 100%, with an increase in geometric mean titers after challenge. Analysis of cytokines revealed that the levels of cytokines including IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-13, IL-12, and IL-18 were significantly increased at days 5 to 14 in group 2. These results demonstrate that the characteristic of pertussis infection in infant rhesus macaque was similar as in human beings, which provide a clue to using infant rhesus macaque as a candidate model for pertussis infection in the future studies",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe average power of rhythmic neural responses as captured by MEG/EEG/LFP recordings is a prevalent index of human brain function. Increasing evidence questions the utility of trial-/group averaged power estimates however, as seemingly sustained activity patterns may be brought about by time-varying transient signals in each single trial. Hence, it is crucial to accurately describe the duration and power of rhythmic and arrhythmic neural responses on the single trial-level. However, it is less clear how well this can be achieved in empirical MEG/EEG/LFP recordings. Here, we extend an existing rhythm detection algorithm (extended Better OSCillation detection: \"eBOSC\"; cf. Whitten et al., 2011) to systematically investigate boundary conditions for estimating neural rhythms at the single-trial level. Using simulations as well as resting and task-based EEG recordings from a micro-longitudinal assessment, we show that alpha rhythms can be successfully captured in single trials with high specificity, but that the quality of single-trial estimates varies greatly between subjects. Despite those signal-to-noise-based limitations, we highlight the utility and potential of rhythm detection with multiple proof-of-concept examples, and discuss implications for single-trial analyses of neural rhythms in electrophysiological recordings. Using an applied example of working memory retention, rhythm detection indicated load-related increases in the duration of frontal theta and posterior alpha rhythms, in addition to a frequency decrease of frontal theta rhythms that was observed exclusively through amplification of rhythmic amplitudes.\n\nHighlightsO_LITraditional narrow-band rhythm metrics conflate the power and duration of rhythmic and arrhythmic periods. We extend a state-of-the-art rhythm detection method (eBOSC) to derive rhythmic episodes in single trials that can disambiguate rhythmic and arrhythmic periods.\nC_LIO_LISimulations indicate that this can be done with high specificity given sufficient rhythmic power, but with strongly impaired sensitivity when rhythmic SNR is low. Empirically, surface EEG recordings exhibit stable inter-individual differences in -rhythmicity in ranges where simulations suggest a gradual bias, leading to high collinearity between narrow-band and rhythm-specific estimates.\nC_LIO_LIBeyond these limitations, we highlight multiple empirical benefits of characterizing rhythmic episodes in single trials, such as (a) a principled separation of rhythmic and arrhythmic content, (b) an amplification of rhythmic amplitudes, and (c) a specific characterization of sustained and transient events.\nC_LIO_LIIn an exemplary application, rhythm-specific estimates increase sensitivity to working memory load effects, in addition to indicating a frequency modulation of frontal theta rhythms through the amplification of rhythmic power.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Task-related plasticity in the brain is triggered by changes in the behavioral meaning of sounds. We investigated plasticity in ferret dorsolateral frontal cortex (dlFC) during an auditory reversal task to study the neural correlates of proactive interference, i.e., perseveration of previously learned behavioral meanings that are no longer task-appropriate. Although the animals learned the task, target recognition decreased after reversals, indicating proactive interference. Frontal cortex responsiveness was consistent with previous findings that dlFC encodes the behavioral meaning of sounds. However, the neural responses observed here were more complex. For example, target responses were strongly enhanced, while responses to non-target tones and noises were weakly enhanced and strongly suppressed, respectively. Moreover, dlFC responsiveness reflected the proactive interference observed in behavior: target responses decreased after reversals, most significantly during incorrect behavioral responses. These findings suggest that the weak representation of behavioral meaning in dlFC may be a neural correlate of proactive interference.\\n\\nSignificance StatementNeural activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) is believed to enable cognitive flexibility during sensory-guided behavior. Since PFC encodes the behavioral meaning of sensory events, we hypothesized that weak representation of behavioral meaning in PFC may limit cognitive flexibility. To test this hypothesis, we recorded neural activity in ferret PFC, while ferrets performed an auditory reversal task in which the behavioral meanings of sounds were reversed during experiments. The reversal task enabled us study PFC responses during proactive interference, i.e. perseveration of previously learned behavioral meanings that are no longer task-appropriate. We found that task performance errors increased after reversals while PFC representation of behavioral meaning diminished. Our findings suggest that proactive interference may occur when PFC forms weak sensory-cognitive associations.",

Thus, searching for and reasoning about mechanisms is fundamental to much of biomedical research, but until now there has been almost no computational infrastructure for this purpose. Recent work in the philosophy of science has explored the central role that the search for mechanistic accounts of biological phenomena plays in biomedical research, providing a conceptual basis for representing and analyzing biological mechanism. The foundational categories for components of mechanisms - entities and activities - guide the development of general, abstract types of biological mechanism parts. Building on that analysis, we have developed a formal framework for describing and representing biological mechanism, MecCog, and applied it to describing mechanisms underlying human genetic disease. Mechanisms are depicted using a graphical notation. Key features are assignment of mechanism components to stages of biological organization and classes; visual representation of uncertainty, ignorance, and ambiguity; and tight integration with literature sources. The MecCog framework facilitates analysis of many aspects of disease mechanism, including the prioritization of future experiments, probing of gene-drug and gene-environment interactions, identification of possible new drug targets, personalized drug choice, analysis of non-linear interactions between relevant genetic loci, and classification of disease based on mechanism.",

Combined with other anthropogenic impacts, the impacts will alter species distributions and contribute to population declines and local extinctions. To provide timely management and conservation of fishes, it is relevant to identify species that will be most impacted by climate change and those that will be resilient. Species traits are considered a promising source of information on characteristics that influence resilience to various environmental conditions and impacts. We collated life history traits and climatic niches of 443 European freshwater fish species and compared those identified as susceptible to climate change to those that are considered to be resilient. Significant differences were observed between the two groups in their distribution, life-history and climatic niches, with climate-change susceptible species being distributed more southwardly within Europe, and being characterized by higher threat levels, lower commercial relevance, lower vulnerability to fishing, smaller body size and warmer thermal envelopes. We establish a list of species revealed to be of highest priority for further research and monitoring regarding climate change susceptibility within Europe. The presented approach represents a promising tool, to quickly assess large groups of species regarding their susceptibility to climate change and other threats, and to identify research and management priorities.",

The 65 genes annotated to CpGs differentially methylated in lung tumors, but not blood, were enriched for RNA processing ontologies.\\n\\nConclusionsWe found highly significant overlap between smoking-related DNA methylation signals in lung cancer and those seen in blood from newborns, from in utero exposure, or adults, from their own exposure. These results suggest that some epigenetic alterations associated with cigarette smoke exposure are tissue specific, but others are common across tissues. These findings support the value of blood-based methylation biomarkers for assessing exposure effects in target tissues.",

    "abstract": "Most retinoblastomas initiate in response to the inactivation of the RB1 gene and loss of functional RB protein. The tumors may form without additional genomic changes and develop after a pre-malignant retinoma phase. Despite this seemingly straightforward etiology, mouse models have not recapitulated the genetic, cellular, and stage-specific features of human retinoblastoma genesis. For example, whereas human retinoblastomas appear to derive from cone photoreceptor precursors, current mouse models develop tumors that derive from other retinal cell types. To investigate the basis of the human cone-specific oncogenesis, we compared developmental-stage-specific cone precursor responses to RB loss in human and murine retina cultures and in cone-specific Rb1 knockout mice. We report that RB-depleted maturing (ARR3+) but not immature (ARR3-) human cone precursors enter the cell cycle, proliferate, and form retinoblastoma-like lesions characterized by Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes, then form low or non-proliferative pre-malignant retinoma-like lesions with fleurettes and high p16INK4A and p130 expression, and finally form highly proliferative retinoblastoma-like masses. In contrast, in murine retina, only RB-depleted immature (Arr3-) cone precursors entered the cell cycle and they failed to progress from S to M phase. Moreover, whereas the intrinsically highly expressed MDM2 and MYCN contribute to RB-depleted maturing (ARR3+) human cone precursor proliferation, ectopic MDM2 and Mycn promoted only immature (Arr3-) murine cone precursor cell cycle entry. These findings demonstrate that developmental-stage-specific as well as speciesand cell-type-specific features sensitize to RB1 inactivation and reveal the human cone precursors capacity to model retinoblastoma initiation, proliferation, pre-malignant arrest, and tumor growth.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRetinoblastoma is a childhood tumor that forms in response to mutations in the RB1 gene and loss of functional RB protein. Prior studies suggested that retinoblastomas arise from cone photoreceptor precursors, whereas mouse models yield tumors deriving from other retinal cell types and lacking human retinoblastoma features. Here, we show that in cultured human retinae, retinoblastomas initiate from RB-depleted cone precursors that are in a specific maturation state and form pre-malignant \\\"retinomas\\\" prior to retinoblastoma lesions, as is believed to occur in retinoblastoma patients. In contrast, Rb-deficient mouse cone precursors of similar maturation state and supplemented with human-cone-precursor-specific oncoproteins fail to proliferate. Thus, human species-specific developmental features underlie retinoblastomagenesis and may challenge the production of accurate mouse retinoblastoma models.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Following cytotoxic therapy, 70% of patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are alive at 5 years compared to 30% of those with similar HPV-negative cancer, which is thought to be due to dysregulation of DNA repair. Loss of transforming growth factor {beta} (TGF{beta}) signaling is a poorly studied consequence of HPV that could contribute to this phenotype.\\n\\nExperimental Design: Human HNSCC cell lines (n=9), patient-derived xenografts (n=9), tissue microarray (n=194), TCGA expression data and primary tumor specimens (n=10) were used to define the relationship between TGF{beta} competency, response to DNA damage, and type of DNA repair.\\n\\nResults: Analysis of HNSCC specimens in situ and in vitro showed that HPV associates with loss of TGF{beta} signaling that increases the response to radiation or cisplatin. TGF{beta} suppressed miR-182 that inhibited both BRCA1, necessary for homologous recombination repair, and FOXO3, which is required for ATM kinase activity. TGF{beta} signaling blockade by either HPV or inhibitors released this control, compromised HRR and increased response to PARP inhibition. Antagonizing miR-182 rescued the homologous recombination deficit in HPV+ cells. Loss of TGF{beta} signaling unexpectedly increased error-prone, alternative end-joining repair.\\n\\nConclusions: HPV-positive HNSCC cells are unresponsive to TGF{beta}. Abrogated TGF{beta} signaling compromises homologous recombination and shifts reliance on alt-EJ repair that provides a mechanistic basis for sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. The effect of HPV in HNSCC provides critical validation of TGF{beta}s role in DNA repair proficiency and further raises the translational potential of TGF{beta} inhibitors in cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Females of most species live longer than do males. Furthermore, lifespan-extending interventions in laboratory model organisms are often more effective in females (Regan and Partridge 2013). For instance, genetic and pharmacological suppression of activity of the insulin/insulin-like signalling - target of rapamycin (IIS-TOR) network generally extends female lifespan more than that of males in both Drosophila and mice (Clancy et al. 2001; Selman et al. 2009). We previously showed that attenuation of Ras-dependent IIS signalling by treatment with the FDA-approved MEK inhibitor, trametinib extends lifespan in females (Slack et al. 2015). Here, we demonstrate that trametinib treatment has beneficial effects on female-specific, age-related gut pathologies, similar to those obtained through dietary restriction (Regan et al. 2016). Importantly, we identify Ras inhibition as an effective lifespan-extending manipulation in males as well as females, pointing to parallel mechanisms of lifespan extension by trametinib in both sexes.",

    "abstract": "Type IA topoisomerases cleave single-stranded DNA and relieve negative supercoils in discrete steps corresponding to the passage of the intact DNA strand through the cleaved strand. Although it is assumed type IA topoisomerases accomplish this strand passage via a protein-mediated DNA gate, opening of this gate has never been observed. We developed a single-molecule assay to directly measure gate opening of the E. coli type IA topoisomerases I and III. We found that following cleavage of single-stranded DNA, the protein gate opens by as much as 6.6 nm and can close against forces in excess of 16 pN. Key differences in the cleavage, ligation and gate dynamics of these two enzymes provide insights into their different cellular functions. The single-molecule results are broadly consistent with conformational changes obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. These results allow us to develop a mechanistic model of type IA topoisomerase-ssDNA interactions.",
