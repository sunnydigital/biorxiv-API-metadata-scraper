    "abstract": "Curvature of biological membranes can be generated by a variety of molecular mechanisms including protein scaffolding, compositional heterogeneity, and cytoskeletal forces. These mechanisms have the net effect of generating tractions (force per unit length) on the bilayer that are translated into distinct shapes of the membrane. Here, we demonstrate how the local shape of the membrane can be used to infer the traction acting locally on the membrane. We show that buds and tubes, two common membrane deformations studied in trafficking processes, have different traction distributions along the membrane and that these tractions are specific to the molecular mechanism used to generate these shapes. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of an axial force applied to the membrane as well as that of an effective line tension can be calculated from these tractions. Finally, we consider the sensitivity of these quantities with respect to uncertainties in material properties and follow with a discussion on sources of uncertainty in membrane shape.",

    "abstract": "Growth rate is a near-universal selective pressure across microbial species. High growth rates require hundreds of metabolic enzymes, each with different nonlinear kinetics, to be precisely tuned within the bounds set by physicochemical constraints. Yet, the metabolic behaviour of many species is characterized by simple relations between growth rate, enzyme expression levels and metabolic rates. We asked if this simplicity could be the outcome of optimisation by evolution. Indeed, when the growth rate is maximized -in a static environment under mass-conservation and enzyme expression constraints- we prove mathematically that the resulting optimal metabolic flux distribution is described by a limited number of subnetworks, known as Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs). We show that, because EFMs are the minimal subnetworks leading to growth, a small active number automatically leads to the simple relations that are measured. We find that the maximal number of flux-carrying EFMs is determined only by the number of imposed constraints on enzyme expression, not by the size, kinetics or topology of the network. This minimal-EFM extremum principle is illustrated in a graphical framework, which explains qualitative changes in microbial behaviours, such as overflow metabolism and co-consumption, and provides a method for identification of the enzyme expression constraints that limit growth under the prevalent conditions. The extremum principle applies to all microorganisms that are selected for maximal growth rates under protein concentration constraints, for example the solvent capacities of cytosol, membrane or periplasmic space.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe microbial genome encodes for a large network of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The reaction rates depend on concentrations of enzymes and metabolites, which in turn depend on those rates. Cells face a number of biophysical constraints on enzyme expression, for example due to a limited membrane area or cytosolic volume. Considering this complexity and nonlinearity of metabolism, how is it possible, that experimental data can often be described by simple linear models? We show that it is evolution itself that selects for simplicity. When reproductive rate is maximised, the number of active independent metabolic pathways is bounded by the number of growth-limiting enzyme constraints, which is typically small. A small number of pathways automatically generates the measured simple relations. We identify the importance of growth-limiting constraints in shaping microbial behaviour, by focussing on their mechanistic nature. We demonstrate that overflow metabolism - an important phenomenon in bacteria, yeasts, and cancer cells - is caused by two constraints on enzyme expression. We derive experimental guidelines for constraint identification in microorganisms. Knowing these constraints leads to increased understanding of metabolism, and thereby to better predictions and more effective manipulations.",

    "abstract": "Recent proposals in quantum gravity have suggested that unknown systems can mediate entanglement between two known quantum systems, if and only if the mediator itself is non-classical. This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\n\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.",

Visual adaptation, an example of such an effect, has been hypothesized to improve stimulus discrimination by decorrelating responses across a set of neural units. While a central theoretical model, behavioral and neural evidence for this theory is limited and inconclusive. Here, we use a parametric 3D shape-space to test whether adaptation decorrelates shape representations in humans. In a behavioral experiment with 20 subjects, we find that adaptation to a shape class improves discrimination of subsequently presented stimuli with similar features. In a BOLD fMRI experiment with 10 subjects we observe that adaptation to a shape class decorrelates the multivariate representations of subsequently presented stimuli with similar features in object-selective cortex. These results support the long-standing proposal that adaptation improves perceptual discrimination and decorrelates neural representations, offering insights into potential underlying mechanisms.",

Current methods of measuring these parameters in Drosophila melanogaster have low temporal resolution and/or require disrupting sleep. Here we report a novel analysis tool for high-resolution, non-invasive measurement of sleep pressure and depth from movement data. Probability of transitioning to an active state, P(Wake), measures sleep depth while probability of transitioning to an inactive state, P(Doze), measures sleep pressure. In vivo and computational analyses show that P(Wake) and P(Doze) are independent and control the amount of total sleep. Importantly, we demonstrate that these probabilities are tied to specific biological processes. Genetic and environmental perturbations demonstrate that a given amount of sleep can be produced by many combinations of underlying P(Wake) and P(Doze). We show that measuring sleep pressure and depth continuously, without disturbing on-going behavior, provides greater mechanistic insight into behavior than measuring the amount of sleep alone.",

Based on nuclear transcription profiles, we define 15,714 protein-coding promoters and 19,231 putative enhancers, and find that both types of element can drive orientation-independent transcription. Additionally, hundreds of promoters produce transcripts antisense to protein coding genes, suggesting involvement in a widespread regulatory mechanism.

    "abstract": "BackgroundChromatin interactions are essential in enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) and transcriptional regulation. CTCF and cohesin proteins located at chromatin interaction anchors and other DNA-binding proteins such as YY1, ZNF143, and SMARCA4 are involved in chromatin interactions. However, there is still no good overall understanding of proteins associated with chromatin interactions and insulator functions.\n\nResultsHere, I describe a systematic and comprehensive approach for discovering DNA-binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs) that affect EPIs and gene expression. This analysis identified 96 biased orientations [64 forward-reverse (FR) and 52 reverse-forward (RF)] of motifs that significantly affected the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes in monocytes, T cells, HMEC, and NPC and included CTCF, cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3), YY1, and ZNF143; some TFs have more than one motif in databases; thus, the total number is smaller than the sum of FRs and RFs. KLF4, ERG, RFX, RFX2, HIF1, SP1, STAT3, and AP1 were associated with chromatin interactions. Many other TFs were also known to have chromatin-associated functions. The predicted biased orientations of motifs were compared with chromatin interaction data. Correlations in expression level of nearby genes separated by the motif sites were then examined among 53 tissues.\n\nConclusionOne hundred FR and RF orientations associated with chromatin interactions and functions were discovered. Most TFs showed weak directional biases at chromatin interaction anchors and were difficult to identify using enrichment analysis of motifs. These findings contribute to the understanding of chromatin-associated motifs involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin interactions/regulation, and histone modifications.",

A mutant of CrPV containing a stop codon in the +1 frame ORFx sequence, yet synonymous in the 0-frame, is attenuated compared to wild-type virus in a Drosophila infection model, indicating the importance of +1 ORFx expression in promoting viral pathogenesis.

    "abstract": "The behavior of genetic circuits is often poorly predictable. A genes expression level is not only determined by the intended regulators, but also largely dictated by changes in ribosome availability imparted by activation or repression of other genes. To address this problem, we design a quasi-integral biomolecular feedback controller that enables the expression level of any gene of interest (GOI) to adapt to changes in available ribosomes. The feedback is implemented through a synthetic small RNA (sRNA) that silences the GOIs mRNA, and uses orthogonal extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor to sense the GOIs translation and to actuate sRNA transcription. Without the controller, the expression level of the GOI is reduced by 50% when a resource competitor is activated. With the controller, by contrast, gene expression level is practically unaffected by the competitor. This feedback controller allows adaptation of genetic modules to variable ribosome demand and thus aids modular construction of complicated circuits.",

We silenced the putative enhancer using the CRISPR interference system and observed 50% decrease in SUOX expression in K562 cells, a cell line that has similar DNase hypersensitive sites and gene expression pattern to the skin tissue at SUOX locus.

Two fundamental questions in bacterial swarming is how the information gathered by individual members of the swarm is shared across the swarm leading to coordinated swarm behaviour and what specific advantages does membership of the swarm provide its members in learning about their environment. In this article, we show a remarkable example of the collective advantage of a bacterial swarm which enables it to sense inert obstacles along its path. Agent based computational model of swarming revealed that independent individual behaviour in response to a two-component signalling mechanism could produce such behaviour. This is striking because independent individual behaviour without any explicit communication between agents was found to be sufficient for the swarm to effectively compute the gradient of signalling molecule concentration across the swarm and respond to it.",

Two such classes of assays, virus quantification assays (VQA) and infectivity assays (IA), aim to estimate the number of viruses present in a solution, and the ability of a viral strain to successfully infect a host cell, respectively. VQAs operate at extremely dilute concentrations and results can be subject to stochastic variability in virus-cell interactions. At the other extreme, high viral particle concentrations are used in IAs, resulting in large numbers of viruses infecting each cell, enough for measurable change in total transcription activity. Furthermore, host cells can be infected at any concentration regime by multiple particles, resulting in a statistical multiplicity of infection (SMOI) and yielding potentially significant variability in the assay signal and parameter estimates. We develop probabilistic models for SMOI at low and high viral particle concentration limits and apply them to the plaque (VQA), endpoint dilution (VQA), and luciferase reporter (IA) assays. A web-based tool implementing our models and analysis is also developed and presented. We test our proposed new methods for inferring experimental parameters from data using numerical simulations and show improvement on existing procedures in all limits.",

First isolated in Uganda in 1947, ZIKV was shown to circulate in enzootic sylvatic cycles in Africa and Asia for at least half a century before the first reported human epidemic occurred in 2007 on the Pacific island of Yap, Micronesia. Subsequently, larger ZIKV outbreaks were recorded in French Polynesia and other South Pacific islands during 2013-2014. In 2015, ZIKV reached Brazil from where it rapidly spread across the Americas and the Caribbean, causing hundreds of thousands of human cases. The factors that have fueled the explosiveness and magnitude of ZIKV emergence in the Pacific and the Americas are poorly understood. Reciprocally, the lack of major human epidemics of ZIKV in regions with seemingly favorable conditions, such as Africa or Asia, remains largely unexplained. To evaluate the potential contribution of vector population diversity to ZIKV epidemiological patterns, we established dose-response curves for eight field-derived Ae. aegypti populations representing the global range of the species, following experimental exposure to six low-passage ZIKV strains spanning the current viral genetic diversity. Our results reveal that African Ae. aegypti are significantly less susceptible than non-African Ae. aegypti across all ZIKV strains tested. We suggest that low susceptibility of vector populations may have contributed to prevent large-scale human transmission of ZIKV in Africa.",

    "abstract": "Suspensions of small planktonic copepods represent a special category in the realm of active matter, as their size falls within the range of colloids, while their motion is so complex that it cannot be rationalized according to basic self-propelled particle models. Indeed, the wide range of individual variability and swimming patterns resemble the behaviour of much larger animals. By analysing hundreds of three dimensional trajectories of the planktonic copepod Clausocalanus furcatus we investigate the possibility of detecting how the motion of this species is affected by different external conditions, such as the presence of food and the effect of gravity. While this goal is hardly achievable by direct inspection of single organism trajectories, we show that this is possible by focussing on simple average metrics commonly used to characterize colloidal suspensions, such as the mean square displacement and the dynamic correlation functions. We find that the presence of food leads to the onset of a clear localization that separates a short-time ballistic from a long-time diffusive regime. Such a benchmark reflects the tendency of C. furcatus to remain temporally feeding in a limited space and disappears when food is absent. Localization is clearly evident in the horizontal plane, but is negligible in the vertical direction, due to the effect of gravity. Our results suggest that simple average descriptors may provide concise and useful information on the swimming properties of planktonic copepods, even though single organism behaviours are strongly heterogeneous.",

    "abstract": "Early and non-invasive diagnosis is critical for enhancing the survival rates of lung cancer. In current study we determined the green autoflorescence (AF) of the pulmonary parenchyma of lung cancer patients, using 488 nm and 500 - 550 nm as excitation wavelength and emission wavelength, respectively. Our study has suggested that decreased green AF intensity of pulmonary parenchyma may be a potential diagnostic biomarker for lung cancer: First, the green AF intensity of the cancerous tissues is less than 40% of those of distant non-neoplastic tissues and peri-neoplastic tissues; second, the green AF intensity of both the distant non-neoplastic tissues and cancerous tissues of squamous carcinoma is significantly lower than that of adenocarcinoma; third, the AF intensity of the peri-neoplastic tissues of the lung cancer patients is negatively correlated with the stages of lung cancer; and fourth, our study on the AF spectrum of pulmonary parenchyma has suggested that the AF may result from the AF of the keratins or FAD of the pulmonary parenchyma. Collectively, our study has suggested that decreased green AF intensity of pulmonary parenchyma may become a novel biomarker for non-invasive diagnosis of lung cancer. The green AF intensity may also be used to non-invasively differentiate squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, as well as the stages of lung cancer. Moreover, our diagnostic approach for lung cancer may be used for image-guided surgery of lung cancer for lesions that have not been identified by CT.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases remain a serious public health concern globally, while the need for reliable and representative surveillance systems remains as acute as ever. The public health surveillance of infectious diseases uses reported positive results from sentinel clinical laboratories or laboratory networks, to survey the presence of specific microbial agents known to constitute a threat to public health in a given population. This monitoring activity is commonly based on a representative fraction of the microbiology laboratories nationally reporting to a single central reference point. However in recent years a number of clinical microbiology laboratories (CML) have undergone a process of consolidation involving a shift towards laboratory amalgamation and closer real-time informational linkage. This report aims to investigate whether such merging activities might have a potential impact on infectious diseases surveillance. Influenza data was used from Belgian public health surveillance 2014-2017, to evaluate whether national infection trends could be estimated equally as effectively from only just one centralised CML serving the wider Brussels area (LHUB-ULB). The overall comparison reveals that there is a close correlation and representativeness of the LHUB-ULB data to the national and international data for the same time periods, both on epidemiological and molecular grounds. Notably, the effectiveness of the LHUB-ULB surveillance remains partially subject to local regional variations. These results illustrate that centralised CML-derived data are not only credible but also advantageous to use for future surveillance and prediction purposes, especially for automatic detection systems that might include multiple layers of information and timely implementation of control strategies.",

    "abstract": "The LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton to Cytoskeleton) complex is an essential multi-protein structure spanning the nuclear envelope. It connects the cytoplasm to the nucleoplasm, functions to maintain nuclear shape and architecture, and regulates chromosome dynamics during cell division. Knowledge of LINC complex composition and function in the plant kingdom is primarily limited to Arabidopsis, but critically missing from the evolutionarily distant monocots which include grasses, the most important agronomic crops worldwide. To fill this knowledge gap, we identified and characterized 22 maize genes, including a new grass-specific KASH gene family. Using bioinformatic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches, we provide evidence that representative KASH candidates localize to the nuclear periphery and interact with ZmSUN2 in vivo. FRAP experiments using domain-deletion constructs verified that this SUN-KASH interaction was dependent on the SUN but not the coiled-coil domain of ZmSUN2. A summary working model is proposed for the entire maize LINC complex encoded by conserved and divergent gene families. These findings expand our knowledge of the plant nuclear envelope in a model grass species, with implications for both basic and applied cellular research.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTGenes encoding maize candidates for the core LINC and associated complex proteins have been comprehensively identified with functional validation by one or more assays for several of the KASH genes.",
