    "abstract": "MotivationConvolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely used in functional motifs identification for large-scale DNA/RNA sequences. Currently, however, the only way to interpret such a convolutional kernel is a heuristic construction of a position weight matrix (PWM) from fragments scored highly by that kernel.\\n\\nResultsInstead of using heuristics, we developed a novel, exact kernel-to-PWM transformation whose equivalency is theoretically proven: the log-likelihood of the resulting PWM generating any DNA/RNA sequence is exactly the sum of a constant and the convolution of the original kernel on the same sequence. Importantly, we further proved that the resulting PWMs performance on sequence classification/regression can be exactly the same as the original kernels under popular CNN frame-works. In simulation, the exact transformation rivals or outperforms the heuristic PWMs in terms of classifying sequences with sequence- or structure-motifs. The exact transformation also faithfully reproduces the output of CNN models on real-world cases, while the heuristic one fails, especially on the case with little prior knowledge on the form of underlying true motifs. Of note, the time complexity of the novel exact transformation is independent on the number of input sequences, enabling it to scale well for massive training sequences.\\n\\nAvailabilityPython scripts for the transformation from kernel to PWM, the inverted transformation from PWM to kernel, and a proof-of-concept for the maximum likelihood estimation of optimal PWM are available through https://github.com/gao-lab/kernel-to-PWM.\\n\\nContactgaog@mail.cbi.pku.edu.cn",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical processing is pervasive in the brain, but its computational significance for learning in real-world conditions, with uncertainty and changes, is disputed. We show that previously proposed qualitative signatures which relied on reports of learned quantities or choices in simple experiments are insufficient to categorically distinguish hierarchical from non-hierarchical models of learning under uncertainty. Instead, we present a novel test which leverages a more complex task, whose hierarchical structure allows generalization between different statistics tracked in parallel. We use reports of confidence to quantitatively and qualitatively arbitrate between the two accounts of learning. Our results indicate that human subjects can track multiple, interdependent levels of uncertainty, and provide clear evidence for hierarchical processing, thereby challenging some influential neurocomputational accounts of learning.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLiver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC) is the second major cancer worldwide, responsible for millions of premature deaths every year. Prediction of clinical staging is vital to implement optimal therapeutic strategy and prognostic prediction in cancer patients. However, to date, no method has been developed for predicting stage of LIHC from genomic profile of samples.\\n\\nResultsIn current study, in silico models have been developed for classifying LIHC patients in early and late stage using RNA expression and DNA methylation data. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset contains 173 early and 177 late stage samples of LIHC, was extensively analysed to identify differentially expressed RNA transcripts and methylated CpG sites that can discriminate early and late stages of LIHC samples with high precision. Naive Bayes model developed using 51 features that combine 21 CpG methylation sites and 30 RNA transcripts achieved maximum MCC 0.58 with accuracy 78.87% on validation dataset. Further, we also analysed genomics and epigenomics profiles of normal and LIHC samples and developed model to classify LIHC samples with AUROC 0.99. In addition, multiclass models developed for classifying samples in normal, early and late stage of cancer and achieved accuracy of 76.54% and AUROC of 0.86.\\n\\nConclusionOur study reveals stage prediction of LIHC samples with high accuracy based on genomics and epigenomics profiling is a challenging task in comparison to classification of LIHC and normal samples.

    "abstract": "In many organisms, host-associated microbial communities are acquired horizontally after birth. This process is believed to be shaped by a combination of environmental and host genetic factors. We examined whether genetic variation in animal behavior could affect the composition of the animals microbiota in different environments. The freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna is primarily planktonic, but exhibits variation in the degree to which it browses in benthic sediments. We performed an experiment with clonal lines of D. magna showing different levels of sediment-browsing intensity exposed to either bacteria-rich or bacteria-poor sediment or whose access to sediments was prevented. We find that the bacterial composition of the environment and genotype-specific browsing intensity together influence the diversity and composition of the Daphnia-associated bacterial community. Exposure to more diverse bacteria did not lead to a more diverse microbiome, but greater abundances of environment-specific bacteria were found associated with host genotypes that exhibited greater browsing behavior. Our results indicate that individual behavior can mediate genotype-by-environment interaction effects on microbiome composition.\\n\\nSummary statementGenetic differences in Daphnia behavior contribute to the amount of environmental bacteria present in their microbiome",

    "abstract": "House mice (Mus musculus) have dispersed to nearly every major landmass around the globe as a result of human activity. They are a highly successful invasive species, but their presence can be devastating for native ecosystems. This is particularly true on small offshore islands where mouse populations may grow unchecked by predators. Here we use genome-wide SNP genotypes to examine ancestry and population structure on two islands of ecological interest - Southeast Farallon Island, near San Francisco, CA; and Floreana Island in the Galapagos - in the context of a total cohort of 520 mice with diverse geographic origins, as a first step towards genetically-based eradication campaigns. We show that Farallon and Floreana mice, like those from previously-studied islands in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, are of admixed European ancestry. We find that these populations are on average more inbred than mainland ones and passed through a strong colonization bottleneck with little subsequent genetic exchange. Finally we show that rodenticide resistance alleles present in parts of Europe are absent from all island populations studied. Our results add nuance to previous studies of island populations based on mitochondrial sequences or small numbers of microsatellites and will be useful for future eradication and monitoring efforts.",

    "abstract": "Protective T cell responses against tumors require the production of Interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}). However, tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) gradually lose their capacity to produce IFN-{gamma} and therefore fail to clear malignant cells. Dissecting the underlying mechanisms that block cytokine production is thus key for improving T cell products. Here we show that although TILs express substantial levels of Ifng mRNA, post-transcriptional mechanisms impede the production of IFN-{gamma} protein due to loss of mRNA stability. CD28 triggering, but not PD1 blocking antibodies, effectively restores the stability of Ifng mRNA. Intriguingly, TILs devoid of AU-rich elements within the 3untranslated region maintain stabilized Ifng mRNA and produce more IFN-{gamma} protein than wild-type TILs. This sustained IFN-{gamma} production translates into effective suppression of tumor outgrowth, which is almost exclusively mediated by direct effects on the tumor cells. We therefore conclude that post-transcriptional mechanisms could be modulated to potentiate effective T cell therapies in cancer.",

We describe the early results of iSeeMammals, a citizen science project that collects opportunistic data on the black bear population in New York State by enlisting volunteers to collect data through observations, hikes, and trail cameras. In 10 months, iSeeMammals increased the spatio-temporal extent of data collection by approximately fourfold and reduced cost by 83% compared to systematic sampling.

    "abstract": "Microglia function is orchestrated through highly-coupled signaling pathways that depend on calcium (Ca2+). In response to extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), transient increases in intracellular Ca2+ driven through the activation of purinergic receptors, P2X and P2Y, are sufficient to promote cytokine synthesis and potentially their release. While steps comprising the pathways bridging purinergic receptor activation with transcriptional responses have been probed in great detail, a quantitative model for how these steps collectively control cytokine production has not been established. Here we developed a minimal computational model that quantitatively links extracellular stimulation of two prominent ionotropic puriner-gic receptors, P2X4 and P2X7, with the graded production of a gene product, namely the tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) cytokine. In addition to Ca2+ handling mechanisms common to eukaryotic cells, our model includes microglia-specific processes including ATP-dependent P2X4 and P2X7 activation, activation of NFAT transcription factors, and TNF production. Parameters for this model were optimized to reproduce published data for these processes, where available. With this model, we determined the propensity for TNF production in microglia, subject to a wide range of ATP exposure amplitudes, frequencies and durations that the cells could encounter in vivo. Furthermore, we have investigated the extent to which modulation of the signal transduction pathways influence TNF production. Our key findings are that TNF production via P2X4 is maximized at low ATP when subject to high frequency ATP stimulation, whereas P2X7 contributes most significantly at millimolar ATPranges. Given that Ca2+ homeostasis in microglia is profoundly important to its function, this computational model provides a quantitative framework to explore hypotheses pertaining to microglial physiology.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis and risk stratification of cancer and many other diseases require the detection of genomic breakpoints as a prerequisite of calling copy number alterations (CNA). This, however, is still challenging and requires time-consuming manual curation. As deep-learning methods outperformed classical state-of-the-art algorithms in various domains and have also been successfully applied to life science problems including medicine and biology, we here propose Deep SNP, a novel Deep Neural Network to learn from genomic data. Specifically, we used a manually curated dataset from 12 genomic single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNPa) profiles as truth-set and aimed at predicting the presence or absence of genomic breakpoints, an indicator of structural chromosomal variations, in windows of 40,000 probes. We compare our results with well-known neural network models as well as Rawcopy though this tool is designed to predict breakpoints and in addition genomic segments with high sensitivity. We show, that Deep SNP is capable of successfully predicting the presence or absence of a breakpoint in large genomic windows and outperforms state-of-the-art neural network models. Qualitative examples suggest that integration of a localization unit may enable breakpoint detection and prediction of genomic segments, even if the breakpoint coordinates were not provided for network training. These results warrant further evaluation of DeepSNP for breakpoint localization and subsequent calling of genomic segments.",

The 59 instances of inappropriate image duplication led to 42 corrections, 5 retractions and 12 instances in which no action was taken. Our experience suggests that the majority of inappropriate image duplications result from errors during figure preparation that can be remedied by correction. Nevertheless, ~10% of papers with inappropriate image duplications in MCB were retracted. If this proportion is representative, then as many as 35,000 papers in the literature are candidates for retraction due to image duplication. The resolution of inappropriate image duplication concerns after publication required an average of 6 h of journal staff time per published paper. MCB instituted a pilot program to screen images of accepted papers prior to publication that identified 12 manuscripts (14.5% out of 83) with image concerns in two months. The screening and correction of papers before publication required an average of 30 min of staff time per problematic paper. Image screening can identify papers with problematic images prior to publication, reduces post-publication problems and requires significantly less staff time than the correction of problems after publication.",

The small ovary (sov) locus was identified in a female sterile screen, and mutants show dramatic ovarian morphogenesis defects. We mapped the locus to the uncharacterized gene CG14438, which encodes a zinc-finger protein that colocalizes with the essential Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1a).

How the Rho signaling system is organized to generate localized responses in cells and prevent their spreading is not understood. Here, we systematically characterized the substrate specificities, localization and interactome of the RhoGEFs/RhoGAPs and revealed their critical role in contextualizing and spatially delimiting Rho signaling. They localize to multiple compartments providing positional information, are extensively interconnected to jointly coordinate their signaling networks and are widely autoinhibited to remain sensitive to local activation. RhoGAPs exhibit lower substrate specificity than RhoGEFs and may contribute to preserving Rho activity gradients. Our approach led us to uncover a multi-RhoGEF complex downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors controlling a Cdc42/RhoA crosstalk. The spatial organization of Rho signaling thus differs from other small GTPases and expands the repertoire of mechanisms governing localized signaling activity.",

Remarkably, Bouncer is not only required for sperm-egg interaction, but also sufficient to allow cross-species fertilization between zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that diverged over 150 million years ago. Our study thus identifies Bouncer as a key determinant of species-specific fertilization in fish. Bouncers closest homolog in tetrapods, SPACA4, is restricted to the male gonad in internally fertilizing vertebrates, suggesting that our findings in fish have relevance to human biology.",

    "abstract": "Many important natural products are produced by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) 1.These giant enzyme machines activate amino acids in an assembly line fashion in which a set of catalytically active domains is responsible for the section, activation, covalent binding and connection of a specific amino acid to the growing peptide chain 1,2. Since NRPS are not restricted to the incorporation of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, their efficient manipulation would give access to a diverse range of peptides available biotechnologically. Here we describe a new fusion point inside condensation (C) domains of NRPSs that enables the efficient production of peptides, even containing non-natural amino acids, in yields higher than 280 mg/L. The technology called eXchange Unit 2.0 (XU2.0) also allows the generation of targeted peptide libraries and therefore might be suitable for the future identification of bioactive peptide derivatives for pharmaceutical and other applications.",

    "abstract": "In rapidly growing bacteria initiation of DNA replication occurs at intervals shorter than the time required for completing genome duplication, leading to overlapping rounds of replication. We propose a mathematical model of DNA replication defined by the periodicity of replication initiation. Our model predicts that a steeper gradient of the replication profile is to be expected in origin proximal regions due to the overlapping rounds of synthesis. By comparing our model with experimental data from a strain with an additional replication origin, we predict defined alterations to replication parameters: (i) a reduced fork velocity when there were twice as many forks as normal; (ii) a slower fork speed if forks move in a direction opposite to normal, in line with head-on replication-transcription collisions being a major obstacle for fork progression; (iii) slower cell doubling for a double origin strain compared to wild-type cells; and (iv) potentially an earlier initiation of replication at the ectopic origin than at the natural origin, which, however, does not a{dot}ect the overall time required to complete synthesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough immunotherapy has recently achieved clinical successes in a variety of cancers, thus far there is no any immunotherapeutic strategy for breast cancer (BC). Thus, it is important to discover biomarkers for identifying the BC patients responsive to immunotherapy. TP53 mutations were often associated with worse clinical outcome in BC, of which the triple-negative BC (TNBC) has a high TP53 mutation rate (approximately 80%). TNBC is high-risk due to its high invasiveness, and lack of targeted therapy. To explore a potentially promising therapeutic option for the TP53-mutated BC subtype, we studied the associations between TP53 mutations and immunogenic activity in BC.\\n\\nMethodsWe compared enrichment levels of 26 immune gene-sets that indicated activities of diverse immune cells, functions, and pathways between TP53-mutated and TP53-wildtype BCs based on two large-scale BC multi-omics data. Moreover, we explored the molecular cues that were associated with the differences in immunogenic activity between TP53-mutated and TP53-wildtype BCs. Furthermore, we performed experimental validation of the findings from bioinformatics analysis.\\n\\nResultsWe found that almost all analyzed immune gene-sets had significantly higher enrichment levels in TP53-mutated BCs compared to TP53-wildtype BCs. Moreover, our experiments confirmed that mutant p53 could increase BC immunogenicity. Furthermore, our computational and experimental results showed that TP53 mutations could promote BC immunogenicity via regulation of the p53-mediated pathways including cell cycle, apoptosis, Wnt, Jak-STAT, NOD-like receptor, and glycolysis. Interestingly, we found that elevated immune activities were likely to be associated with better survival prognosis in TP53-mutated BCs, but not necessarily in TP53-wildtype BCs.\\n\\nConclusionsTP53 mutations promote immunogenic activity in breast cancer. This finding demonstrates a different effect of p53 dysfunction on tumor immunogenicity from that of previous studies, suggesting that the TP53 mutation status could be a useful biomarker for stratifying BC patients responsive to immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Telomeres carry a constitutive 3 overhang that can bind RPA and activate ATR signaling. POT1a, a single-stranded (ss) DNA binding protein in mouse shelterin, has been proposed to repress ATR signaling by preventing RPA binding. Repression of ATR at telomeres requires the TPP1/TIN2 mediated tethering of POT1a to the the rest of the shelterin complex situated on the ds telomeric DNA. The simplest version of the tethered exclusion model for ATR repression suggests that the only critical features of POT1a are its connection to shelterin and its binding to ss telomeric DNA binding. In agreement with the model, we show that a shelterin-tethered RPA70 mutant, lacking the ATR recruitment domain, is effective in repressing ATR signaling at telomeres. However, arguing against the simple tethered exclusion model, the nearly identical POT1b subunit of shelterin is much less proficient in ATR repression than POT1a. We now show that POT1b has the intrinsic ability to fully repress ATR but is prevented from doing so when bound to the CST/Pol/primase complex. The data establish that shelterin represses ATR with a tethered ssDNA-binding domain that excludes RPA from the 3 overhang and suggest that ATR repression does not require the interaction of POT1 with the 3 end or G4 DNA.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by motor neuron degeneration and muscle paralysis. Several studies indicate that pathological changes in the skeletal muscle contribute to disease progression. We report a significant increase of {beta}-secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the skeletal muscle but not the spinal cord or cerebral cortex of hSOD1 (G93A) transgenic ALS mouse models. Enhanced {beta}-secretase processing of APP was manifested by up-regulated expression of {beta}CTF, the 22-kd CTF of APP, and {beta}-secretase processing enzyme, BACE1. Morphological analysis demonstrated that enhanced {beta}-secretase processing of APP mainly occurred in the atrophic myofibers of ALS mice. We also observed a similar change in APP processing in an hSOD1 (G93A) transgenic ALS pig model, suggesting that enhanced {beta}-secretase processing of APP in skeletal muscle may be a common pathological feature of ALS. These findings reveal a selective change in APP processing in skeletal muscle of ALS animal models, and highlight the involvement of aberrant APP processing in ALS pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila larva executes a stereotypical exploratory routine that appears to consist of stochastic alternation between straight peristaltic crawling and reorientation events through lateral bending. We present a model of larval mechanics for axial and transverse motion over a planar substrate, and use it to develop a simple, reflexive neuromuscular model from physical principles. In the absence of damping and driving, the mechanics of the body produces axial travelling waves, lateral oscillations, and unpredictable, chaotic deformations. The neuromuscular system counteracts friction to recover these motion patterns, giving rise to forward and backward peristalsis in addition to turning. The model produces spontaneous exploration, even though the model nervous system has no intrinsic pattern generating or decision making ability, and neither senses nor drives bending motions. Ultimately, our model suggests a novel view of larval exploration as a deterministic superdiffusion process which is mechanistically grounded in the chaotic mechanics of the body.",
