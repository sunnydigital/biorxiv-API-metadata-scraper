    "abstract": "While the biodiversity and biogeography of protists inhabiting many ecosystems have been intensely studied using different sequencing approaches, tropical ecosystems are relatively under-studied. Here we sampled planktonic waters from 32 lakes associated with four different river-floodplains systems in Brazil, and sequenced the DNA using a metabarcoding approach with general eukaryotic primers. The lakes were dominated by the largely free-living Discoba (mostly the Euglenida) and Ciliophora unlike previously sampled Neotropical environments, bu the community similarities between samples were likewise low. These protists inhabiting these floodplains potentially form part of the large diversity of unknown diversity in the tropics.",

    "abstract": "Cell wall glycopolymers on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria are fundamental to bacterial physiology and infection biology. These structures have also gained interest as vaccine antigens, in particular for the human pathogens Group A Streptococcus (GAS) and Streptococcus mutans. Streptococcal cell wall glycopolymers are considered to be functional homologues of wall teichoic acids but surprisingly lack the biologically-relevant and characteristic anionic charge. Here we identify gacH, a gene of unknown function in the GAS Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) biosynthetic cluster, in two independent transposon library screens for its ability to confer resistance to zinc and susceptibility to the bactericidal enzyme human group IIA secreted phospholipase A2. To understand the underlying mechanism of these phenotypes, we determined the structure of the extracellular domain of GacH and discover that it represents a new family of glycerol phosphate (GroP) transferases. Importantly, we demonstrate the presence of GroP in both the GAC and the homologous Serotype c Carbohydrate (SCC) from S. mutans, which is conferred by gacH and sccH products, respectively. NMR analysis of GAC released from cell wall by non-destructive methods reveals that approximately 30% of the GAC GlcNAc side-chains are modified by GroP at the C6 hydroxyl group. This previously unrecognized structural modification impacts host-pathogen interaction and has implications for vaccine design.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/337519v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6d7598org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@435695org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e9515corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dc78b7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Microbial interactions are an underappreciated force in shaping insect microbiome communities. Although pairwise patterns of symbiont interactions have been identified, we have a poor understanding regarding the scale and the nature of co-occurrence and co-exclusion interactions within the microbiome. To characterize these patterns in mosquitoes, we sequenced the bacterial microbiome of Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus caught in the field or reared in the laboratory and used these data to generate interaction networks. For collections, we used traps that attracted host-seeking or ovipositing female mosquitoes to determine how physiological state affects the microbiome under field conditions. Interestingly, we saw few differences in species richness or microbiome community structure in mosquitoes caught in either trap. Co-occurrence and co-exclusion analysis identified 116 pairwise interactions substantially increasing the list of bacterial interactions observed in mosquitoes. Networks generated from the microbiome of Ae. aegypti often included highly interconnected hub bacteria. There were several instances where co-occurring bacteria co-excluded a third taxa, suggesting the existence of tripartite relationships. Several associations were observed in multiple species or in field and laboratory-reared mosquitoes indicating these associations are robust and not influenced by environmental or host factors. To demonstrate that microbial interactions can influence colonization of the host, we administered symbionts to Ae. aegypti larvae that either possessed or lacked their resident microbiota. We found that the presence of resident microbiota can inhibit colonization of particular bacterial taxa. Our results highlight that microbial interactions in mosquitoes are complex and influence microbiome composition.",

    "abstract": "Leishmania RNA virus (LRV) is a double strand RNA virus belonging to the Totiviridae family detected as cytoplasmic inclusions in some strains of the human parasite Leishmania spp. Experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that human co-infection with Leishmania spp-LRV triggers an exacerbated immune response in the host that can be responsible for the observed complicated outcomes in cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), such as mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) and treatment failure of cutaneous leishmaniasis (TFCL). However, the reported frequencies of LRV associated to complicated outcomes in patients series are highly variable, diminishing the relevance on the virus presence in the pathogenesis of the disease. For determining if the apparent inconsistent information about the frequency of LRV associated to CL complicated outcomes could be connected with the virus detection approach, this study tested previously described methods for LRV detection in clinical samples of patients according with the type of sample. In 36 samples with diagnosis of complicated forms of CL (15 ML, 21 TFCL) and 6 samples with non-Leishmania spp infection, LRV presence was assessed by RT-PCR, RT-qPCR and nested-PCR.\\n\\nBy combining methods, LRV1 presence was confirmed in 45% (9/20) of isolates and 75% (12/16) of biopsies. The predominant LRV1-infected Leishmania species in this study was Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis and, for first time, Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis was found infected in clinical samples. In a number of cases, LRV1 was undetectable in the isolates but present in their respective biopsies, suggesting the possibility of underreporting of LRV1 presence in studies focused in parasites isolates exclusively.",

    "abstract": "Presynaptic Ca2+ evokes exocytosis, endocytosis, and short-term synaptic plasticity. However, Ca2+ flux and interactions at presynaptic molecular targets are difficult to determine, because imaging has limited resolution. We measured single varicosity presynaptic Ca2+ using Ca2+ dyes as buffers, and constructed models of Ca2+ dispersal. Action potentials evoked Ca2+ transients (peak amplitude, 789{+/-}39 nM, within 2 ms of stimulation; decay times, 119{+/-}10 ms) with little variation when measured with low-affinity dye. Endogenous Ca2+ buffering capacities, action potential-evoked free [Ca2+]{inverted exclamation} and total amounts entering terminals were determined using high-affinity Ca2+ dyes to buffer Ca2+ transients. These data constrained Monte Carlo (MCell) simulations of Ca2+ entry, buffering, and removal. Data were well-fit with simulations of experimentally-determined Ca2+ fluxes, buffered by simulated Calbindin28K. Simulations were consistent with clustered Ca2+ entry followed within 2 ms by diffusion throughout the varicosity. Repetitive stimulation caused free varicosity Ca2+ to sum. However, simulated in nanometer domains, its removal by pumps and buffering was negligible, while diffusion rates were high. Thus, Ca2+ within tens of nanometers of entry, did not accumulate during sequential stimuli. A model of synaptotagmin1-Ca2+ binding indicates that even with 10 M free varicosity Ca2+, synaptogmin1 must be within tens of nanometers of channels to ensure occupation of all its Ca2+ binding sites. Repetitive stimulation, which evokes short-term synaptic enhancement, does not modify probabilities of Ca2+ fully occupying synaptotagmin1s C2 domains, suggesting that enhancement is not mediated by Ca2+-synaptotagmin1. We conclude that at spatio-temporal scale of fusion machines, Ca2+ necessary for their activation is diffusion dominated.",

    "abstract": "Many neurons in the brain, such as place cells in the rodent hippocampus, have localized receptive fields, i.e., they respond to a small neighborhood of stimulus space. What is the functional significance of such representations and how can they arise? Here, we propose that localized receptive fields emerge in similarity-preserving networks of rectifying neurons that learn low-dimensional manifolds populated by sensory inputs. Numerical simulations of such networks on standard datasets yield manifold-tiling localized receptive fields. More generally, we show analytically that, for data lying on symmetric manifolds, optimal solutions of objectives, from which similarity-preserving networks are derived, have localized receptive fields. Therefore, nonnegative similarity-preserving mapping (NSM) implemented by neural networks can model representations of continuous manifolds in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making in two-alternative forced choice tasks has several underlying components including stimulus encoding, perceptual categorization, response selection, and response execution. Sequential sampling models of decision-making are based on an evidence accumulation process to a decision boundary. Animal and human studies have focused on perceptual categorization and provide evidence linking brain signals in parietal cortex to the evidence accumulation process. In this exploratory study, we use a task where the dominant contribution to response time is response selection and model the response time data with the drift-diffusion model. EEG measurement during the task show that the Readiness Potential (RP) recorded over motor areas has timing consistent with the evidence accumulation process. The duration of the RP predicts decision-making time, the duration of evidence accumulation, suggesting that the RP partly reflects an evidence accumulation process for response selection in the motor system. Thus, evidence accumulation may be a neural implementation of decision-making processes in both perceptual and motor systems. The contributions of perceptual categorization and response selection to evidence accumulation processes in decision-making tasks can be potentially evaluated by examining the timing of perceptual and motor EEG signals.",

    "abstract": "A major transition in the history of the Pancrustacea was the invasion of several lineages of these animals onto land. We investigated the functional performance of odor-capture organs, antennae with olfactory sensilla arrays, through the use of a computational model of advection and diffusion of odorants to olfactory sensilla while varying three parameters thought to be important to odor capture (Reynolds number, gap-width-to-sensillum-dameter ratio, and angle of the sensilla array with respect to oncoming flow). We also performed a sensitivity analysis on these parameters using uncertainty quantification to analyze their relative contributions to odor-capture performance. The results of this analysis indicate that odor capture in water and in air are fundamentally different. Odor capture in water and leakiness of the array are highly sensitive to Reynolds number and moderately sensitive to angle, whereas odor capture in air is highly sensitive to gap widths between sensilla and moderately sensitive to angle. Leakiness is not a good predictor of odor capture in air, likely due to the relative importance of diffusion to odor transport in air compared to water. We also used the sensitivity analysis to make predictions about morphological and kinematic diversity in extant groups of aquatic and terrestrial crustaceans. Aquatic crustaceans will likely exhibit denser arrays and induce flow within the arrays, whereas terrestrial crustaceans will rely on more sparse arrays with wider gaps and little-to-no animal-induced currents.",

    "abstract": "Plants can detect pathogen invasion by sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). This sensing process leads to the induction of defense responses. Most PAMP mechanisms of action have been described in the guard cells. Here, we describe the effects of chitin, a PAMP found in fungal cell walls, on the cellular osmotic water permeability (Pf) of the leaf vascular bundle-sheath (BS) and mesophyll cells and its subsequent effect on leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf).\\n\\nThe BS is a parenchymatic tissue that tightly encases the vascular system. BS cells have been shown to control Kleaf through changes in their Pf, for example, in response to ABA. It was recently reported that, in Arabidopsis, the chitin receptors chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 (CERK1) and LYSINE MOTIF RECEPTOR KINASE 5 (LYK5) are highly expressed in the BS, as well as the neighboring mesophyll. Therefore, we studied the possible impact of chitin on these cells.\\n\\nOur results revealed that both BS cells and mesophyll cells exhibit a sharp decrease in Pf in response to chitin treatment. In addition, xylem-fed chitin decreased Kleaf and led to stomatal closure. However, an Atlyk5 mutant showed none of these responses. Complimenting AtLYK5 specifically in the BS cells (using the SCARECROW promoter) and transient expresion in mesophyll cells each resulted in a response to chitin that was similar to that observed in the wild type. These results suggest that BS and mesophyll cells each play a role in the perception of apoplastic chitin and in initiating chitin-triggered immunity.\\n\\nSignificance StatementPAMP perception by plant receptors triggers various defense responses important for plant immunity. Here we provide new insights into a topic that has received a great deal of previous attention, revealing that a chitin immune response is present in additional leaf tissues other than the stomata. Chitin perception by the bundle sheath cells enwrapping the whole leaf vascular system decrease its cellular osmotic permeability and leaf hydraulic conductance. This in turn, leads to hydraulic signals being sent to the stomata and regulates whole-leaf water balance in response to chitin application and, perhaps, during fungal infection.

Despite a decades-old empirical literature, little theoretical work has explored when natural selection may favor bequeathal. We present a simple mathematical model of the evolution of bequeathal in a stable environment, under both global and local dispersal. We find that natural selection favors bequeathal when adults are competitively advantaged over juveniles, baseline mortality is high, the environment is unsaturated, and when juveniles experience high dispersal mortality. However, frequently bequeathal may not evolve, because the fitness cost for the adult is too large relative to inclusive fitness benefits. Additionally, there are many situations for which bequeathal is an ESS, yet cannot invade the population. As bequeathal in real populations appears to be facultative, yet-to-be-modeled factors like timing of birth in the breeding season may strongly influence the patterns seen in natural populations.",

In order to preserve the high levels of endemism and biological diversity at different hierarchical levels, knowledge of the evolutionary history and current genetic structure of Corso-Sardinian endemics is instrumental. Microsatellite markers were newly developed and used to study the genetic structure and taxonomic status of Ruta corsica and Ruta lamarmorae, rare endemics of Corsica and Sardinia, respectively, and previously considered a single species. Our analyses identified high levels of genetic variation within each species (P=0.883, He=0.543 for R. corsica; P=0.972, He=0.627 for R. lamarmorae). Intrinsic traits of the species (hermaphroditism, proterandry and polyploidy) and island-dependent factors (i.e. age, origin and history of the islands) might explain the detected high levels of genetic variation. We discovered differentiation between R. corsica and R. lamarmorae, and genetic structure within each species, which are consistent with the observation of low dispersal ability for both species. Our genetic results support the recent taxonomic classification of R. corsica and R. lamarmorae as separate species and suggest that they diverge at only few loci. One R. corsica population (SA) strongly differed from all other studied populations and appeared to be the product of hybridization between the two species in STRUCTURE analyses. Our results provide important insights for the conservation of the two rare endemics. Further genetic analyses are recommended for R. lamarmorae and for population SA (R. corsica).",

    "abstract": "Understanding how invading pathogens are sensed within the brain is necessary to uncover how effective immune response are mounted in immunoprivileged sites. The eukaryotic parasite Toxoplasma gondii colonizes the brain of its hosts and initiates robust immune cell recruitment, but little is known about innate recognition of T. gondii within brain tissue. The host damage signal IL-33 is one protein that has been implicated in control of chronic T. gondii infection, but the specific impact of IL-33 signaling within the brain is unclear. Here, we show that IL-33 is expressed by oligodendrocytes and astrocytes during T. gondii infection, is released into the cerebrospinal fluid of T. gondii-infected animals, and is required for control of infection. IL-33 signaling promotes chemokine expression within brain tissue and is required for the recruitment of peripheral anti-parasitic immune cells, including IFN-{gamma}-expressing T cells and iNOS-expressing monocytes. Importantly, we find that the beneficial effects of IL-33 during chronic infection are not a result of signaling on infiltrating immune cells, but rather on radio-resistant responders, and specifically, astrocytes. Mice with IL-33R-deficient astrocytes fail to promote an adaptive immune response in the CNS and control parasite burden, demonstrating that astrocytes can directly respond to IL-33 in vivo. Together, these results indicate a brain-specific mechanism by which IL-33 is released and sensed locally, to engage the peripheral immune system in controlling a neurotropic pathogen.",

We applied the method to over one hundred infected Ixodes scapularis ticks collected from New York State, USA in 2015 and 2016. Analysis of strain distributions within individual ticks suggests an overabundance of multiple infections by five or more strains, inhibitory interactions among co-infecting strains, and presence of a new strain closely related to Borreliella bissettiae.

    "abstract": "Heteroresistance is a phenomenon where isogenic bacteria population exhibits a diverse antibiotic resistance pattern at sub-population or single cell level. The sub-populations with higher resistance can remain undetected with conventional diagnostics which makes them subsequently harder to treat. Such surviving phenotypically heterogeneous sub-populations are also a potential hotbed for novel mutations, thus increasing the resistance permanently in bacteria. Droplet microfluidics gives tools for high-throughput analysis of bacteria and their response to antibiotics at single cell level, which is difficult to obtain with traditional agar plate technologies. In here we show for the first time the precise digital quantification of drug resistance profile in isogenic population at single cell level. We also see that the inhibiting amount of drug per bacteria remains quite stable regardless of bacteria density. Interestingly, the bacteria clump together preferably near these sub-inhibitory conditions. The technology and findings we describe here provide novel quantitative insight into the heteroresistance which is a key step in understanding the pathways leading to drug resistance. This knowledge is crucial in the context of global drug resistance threat as it can help us to find tools to prevent further escalation of drug resistance.",

The Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (SFK) are essential for nervous system homeostasis and are increasingly implicated in degenerative disease.

We used fMRI of object-selective cortex to determine the representational (dis)similarities of memory representations serving current and prospective perceptual tasks.

A cue indicated whether the target object should be looked for first (currently relevant), second (prospectively relevant), or if it could be forgotten (irrelevant). Prior to the first search, representations of current, prospective and irrelevant objects were similar, with strongest decoding for current representations compared to prospective (Experiment 1) and irrelevant (Experiment 2).

Surprisingly, these size distributions differ significantly from observing single cells in isolation. In populations, cells seemingly grow to different sizes, typically exhibit less cell-to-cell variability and often display qualitatively different sensitivities to cell cycle noise and division errors.

    "abstract": "There is widespread agreement that episodic memory is organized into a timeline of past experiences. Recent work suggests that the hippocampus may parse the flow of experience into discrete episodes separated by event boundaries. A complementary body of work suggests that context changes gradually as experience unfolds. We recorded from hippocampal neurons as male long evans rats performed 6 blocks of an object discrimination task in sets of 15 trials. Each block was separated by removal from the testing chamber for a delay to enable segmentation. The reward contingency reversed from one block to the next to incentivize segmentation. We expected animals to hold two distinct, recurring representations of context to match the two distinct rule contingencies. Instead, we found that overtrained rats began each block neither above nor below chance but by guessing randomly. While many units had clear firing fields selective to the conjunction of objects in places, a significant population also reflected a continuously drifting code both within block and across blocks. Despite clear boundaries between blocks, we saw no neural evidence for event segmentation in this experiment. Rather, the hippocampal ensemble drifted continuously across time. This continuous drift in the neural representation was consistent with the lack of segmentation observed in behavior.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe neuroscience literature yet to reach consensus as to how hippocampal firing fields support the organizing of events across time in episodic memory. Initial reports of hippocampal activity focused on discrete episodes within which representations were stable, and across which representations remapped. However, it remains unclear whether this segmentation of representations is merely an artifact of cue responsivity. More recently, research has shown that a proportion of the population codes for temporal aspects of context by exhibiting varying degrees of drift in their firing fields. Drift is hypothesized to represent a continually evolving temporal context, however it is unclear whether this drift is continuous or is also a mere artifact of changing experiences. We recorded from the dorsal hippocampus of rats performing an object discrimination task that involved contexts that were segmented in time. Overtrained rats were unable to anticipate the identity of the upcoming context, but may have used context boundaries to their advantage. Event segmentation theory predicts that hippocampal ensembles would alternate between behaviorally-relevant segments. Contrary to these predictions, animals showed weak evidence of context segmentation, even across blocks with different reward contingencies. Hippocampal ensembles showed neither evidence of alternating between stable contexts nor sensitivity to context boundaries, but did show robust temporal drift.",

    "abstract": "The accurate prediction of RNA secondary structure from primary sequence has had enormous impact on research from the past forty years. While many algorithms are available to make these predictions, the inclusion of non-nested loops, termed pseudoknots, still poses challenges. Here, we describe a new method to compute the entire free energy landscape of secondary structures of RNA resulting from a primary RNA sequence, by combining a polymer physics model for the entropy of pseudoknots with exhaustive enumeration of the set of possible structures. Our polymer physics model can address arbitrarily complex pseudoknots and has only two free loop entropy parameters that correspond to concrete physical quantities, over an order of magnitude fewer than even the sparsest state-of-the-art algorithms. Our model outperforms previously published methods in predicting pseudoknots, while performing on par with current methods in the prediction of non-pseudoknotted structures. For RNA sequences of ~ 45 nucleotides, or ~ 90 with minimal heuristics, the complet-e enumeration of possible secondary structures can be accomplished quickly despite the NP-complete nature of the problem.",

    "abstract": "The sexy-sperm hypothesis posits that polyandrous females derive an indirect fitness benefit from multi-male mating because they increase the probability their eggs are fertilized by males whose sperm have high fertilizing efficiency, which is assumed to be heritable and conferred on their sons. However, whether this process occurs is contentious because father-to-son heritability may be constrained by the genetic architecture underlying traits important in sperm competition within certain species. Previous empirical work has revealed such genetic constraints in the seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, a model system in sperm competition studies in which female multi-male mating is ubiquitous. Using the seed beetle, I tested a critical prediction of the sexy-sperm hypothesis that polyandrous females produce sons that are on average more successful under sperm competition than sons from monandrous females. Contrary to the prediction of the sexy-sperm hypothesis, I found that sons from monandrous females had significantly higher relative paternity in competitive double matings. Moreover, post-hoc analyses revealed that these sons produced significantly larger ejaculates when second to mate, despite being smaller. This study is the first to provide empirical evidence for post-copulatory processes favoring monandrous sons and discusses potential explanations for the unexpected bias in paternity.",

Although the rates at which mutations occur vary considerably between species, little is known about differences within species, or the genetic and molecular basis of these differences.

We developed a high-throughput fluctuation assay and used it to quantify mutation rates in natural yeast isolates and in 1040 segregant progeny from a cross between BY, a lab strain, and RM, a wine strain. We observed that mutation rate varies among yeast strains and is highly heritable (H2=0.46). We performed linkage mapping in the segregants and identified four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying mutation rate variation in the cross. We fine-mapped two QTLs to the underlying causal genes, RAD5 and MKT1, that contribute to mutation rate variation. These genes also underlie sensitivity to the DNA damaging agents 4NQO and MMS, suggesting a connection between spontaneous mutation rate and mutagen sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "One deficit associated with schizophrenia (SZ) is the reduced ability to distinguish sensations resulting from self-caused actions from those due to external sources. This reduced sense of agency (SoA, awareness of ownership over self-generated actions) is hypothesized to result from a diminished utilization of internal monitoring signals of self-movement (i.e., efferent copy) which subsequently impairs forming and utilizing sensory prediction errors (differences between the predicted and actual sensory consequences resulting from movement). Here, we investigated the connections between clinical SZ symptoms and motor adaptation, a process that uses sensory prediction errors to update motor output. Schizophrenia patients (SZP, N=30) and non-psychiatric healthy control subjects (HC, N=31) adapted to altered movement visual feedback, and then applied the motor recalibration to untested contexts (i.e., the spatial generalization to untrained targets). Although adaptation was similar for SZP and controls, the extent of generalization was significantly less for SZP; movement trajectories made by patients to the furthest untrained target (135{degrees}) before and after adaptation were largely indistinguishable. Interestingly, deficits in the generalization were correlated to positive symptoms of psychosis (e.g., hallucinations), but not negative symptoms. Generalization was also associated with subjective measures of SoA across both SZP and HC, emphasizing the major role action awareness plays in motor behavior, and suggesting that tendencies to misattribute agency, even in HC, manifest in abnormal motor performance. We discuss the possible link of these findings to cerebellar circuit abnormalities that may be a common source for deficits in the utilization of sensory prediction errors and aberrant SoA.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) excites populations of neurons in the stimulated cortex, and the resulting activation may spread to connected brain regions. The distributed cortical response can be recorded with electroencephalography (EEG). Since TMS also stimulates peripheral sensory and motor axons and generates a loud \\\"click\\\" sound, the TMS-evoked EEG potential (TEP) not only reflects neural activity induced by transcranial neuronal excitation but also neural activity reflecting somatosensory and auditory processing. In 17 healthy young individuals, we systematically assessed the contribution of multisensory peripheral stimulation to TEPs using a TMS-compatible EEG system. Real TMS was delivered with a figure-of-eight coil over the left para-median posterior parietal cortex or superior frontal gyrus with the coil being oriented perpendicularly or in parallel to the target gyrus. We also recorded the EEG responses evoked by sham stimulation over the posterior parietal and superior frontal cortex, mimicking the auditory and somatosensory sensations evoked by real TMS. We applied state-of-the-art procedures to attenuate somatosensory and auditory confounds during real TMS, including the placement of a foam layer underneath the coil and auditory noise masking. Despite these precautions, the temporal and spatial features of the cortical potentials evoked by real TMS at the prefrontal and parietal site closely resembled the cortical potentials evoked by realistic sham TMS, both for early and late TEP components. Our findings stress the need to include a peripheral multisensory control stimulation in the study design to enable a dissociation between truly transcranial and non-transcranial components of TEPs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease are characterized by heterogeneity in age at onset, disease duration, rate of progression, and constellation of motor versus nonmotor features. Due to these variable presentations, counseling of patients about their individual risks and prognosis is limited. There is an unmet need for predictive tests that facilitate early detection and characterization of distinct disease subtypes as well as improved, individualized predictions of the disease course. The emergence of machine learning to detect hidden patterns in complex, multi-dimensional datasets provides unparalleled opportunities to address this critical need.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe used unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches for subtype identification and prediction. We used machine learning methods on comprehensive, longitudinal clinical data from the Parkinson Disease Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) (n=328 cases) to identify patient subtypes and to predict disease progression. The resulting models were validated in an independent, clinically well-characterized cohort from the Parkinson Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP) (n=112 cases). Our analysis distinguished three distinct disease subtypes with highly predictable progression rates, corresponding to slow, moderate and fast disease progressors. We achieved highly accurate projections of disease progression four years after initial diagnosis with an average Area Under the Curve of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.96 {+/-} 0.01 for PDvec1, 0.87 {+/-} 0.03 for PDvec2, and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02 for PDvec3). We have demonstrated robust replication of these findings in the independent validation cohort.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data-driven results enable clinicians to deconstruct the heterogeneity within their patient cohorts. This knowledge could have immediate implications for clinical trials by improving the detection of significant clinical outcomes that might have been masked by cohort heterogeneity. We anticipate that machine learning models will improve patient counseling, clinical trial design, allocation of healthcare resources and ultimately individualized clinical care.",

    "abstract": "Face-selective and voice-selective brain regions have been shown to represent face-identity and voice-identity, respectively. Here we investigated whether there are modality-general person-identity representations in the brain that can be driven by either a face or a voice, and that invariantly represent naturalistically varying face and voice tokens of the same identity. According to two distinct models, such representations could exist either in multimodal brain regions (Campanella and Belin, 2007) or in face-selective brain regions via direct coupling between face- and voice-selective regions (von Kriegstein et al., 2005). To test the predictions of these two models, we used fMRI to measure brain activity patterns elicited by the faces and voices of familiar people in multimodal, face-selective and voice-selective brain regions. We used representational similarity analysis (RSA) to compare the representational geometries of face- and voice-elicited person-identities, and to investigate the degree to which pattern discriminants for pairs of identities generalise from one modality to the other. We found no matching geometries for faces and voices in any brain regions. However, we showed crossmodal generalisation of the pattern discriminants in the multimodal right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS), suggesting a modality-general person-identity representation in this region. Importantly, the rpSTS showed invariant representations of face- and voice-identities, in that discriminants were trained and tested on independent face videos (different viewpoint, lighting, background) and voice recordings (different vocalizations). Our findings support the Multimodal Processing Model, which proposes that face and voice information is integrated in multimodal brain regions.\\n\\nSignificance statementIt is possible to identify a familiar person either by looking at their face or by listening to their voice. Using fMRI and representational similarity analysis (RSA) we show that the right posterior superior sulcus (rpSTS), a multimodal brain region that responds to both faces and voices, contains representations that can distinguish between familiar people independently of whether we are looking at their face or listening to their voice. Crucially, these representations generalised across different particular face videos and voice recordings. Our findings suggest that identity information from visual and auditory processing systems is combined and integrated in the multimodal rpSTS region.",

We propose a mechanism for dynamical self-organization in the mEC that can produce this modular structure. In attractor network models of grid formation, the period of a single module is set by the length scale of recurrent inhibition between neurons. We show that grid cells will instead form a hierarchy of discrete modules if a continuous increase in inhibition distance along the dorso-ventral axis of the mEC is accompanied by excitatory interactions along this axis. Moreover, constant scale ratios between successive modules arise through geometric relationships between triangular grids, whose lattice constants are separated by [Formula], or other ratios.

    "abstract": "Diffusion MRI fiber tracking provides a non-invasive method for mapping the trajectories of human brain connections, but its false connection problem has been a major challenge. This study introduces topology-informed pruning (TIP), a method that automatically identifies singular tracts and eliminates them to improve the tracking accuracy. The accuracy of the tractography with and without TIP was evaluated by a team of 6 neuroanatomists in a blinded setting to examine whether TIP could improve the accuracy. The results showed that TIP improved the tracking accuracy by 11.93% in the single-shell scheme and by 3.47% in the grid scheme. The improvement is significantly different from a random pruning (p-value < 0.001). The diagnostic agreement between TIP and neuroanatomists was comparable to the agreement between neuroanatomists. The proposed TIP algorithm can be used to automatically clean up noisy fibers in deterministic tractography, with a potential to confirm the existence of a fiber connection in basic neuroanatomical studies or clinical neurosurgical planning.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONThis study aimed to determine if repeated exposure to unpredictable trips and slips while walking can improve balance recovery responses when predictive gait alterations (e.g. slowing down) are minimised.\\n\\nMETHODSTen young adults walked on a 10-m walkway that induced slips and trips in fixed and random locations. Participants were exposed to a total of 12 slips, 12 trips and 6 non-perturbed walks in three conditions: 1) right leg fixed location, 2) left leg fixed location and 3) random leg and location. Kinematics during non-perturbed walks and previous and recovery steps were analysed.\\n\\nRESULTSThroughout the three conditions, participants walked with similar gait speed, step length and cadence(p>0.05). Participants extrapolated centre of mass (XCoM) was anteriorly shifted immediately before slips at the fixed location (p<0.01), but this predictive gait alteration did not transfer to random perturbation locations. Improved balance recovery from trips in the random location was indicated by increased margin of stability and step length during recovery steps (p<0.05). Changes in balance recovery from slips in the random location was shown by reduced backward XCoM displacement and reduced slip speed during recovery steps (p<0.05).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSEven in the absence of most predictive gait alterations, balance recovery responses to trips and slips were improved through exposure to repeated unpredictable perturbations. A common predictive gait alteration to lean forward immediately before a slip was not useful when the perturbation location was unpredictable. Training balance recovery with unpredictable perturbations may be beneficial to fall avoidance in everyday life.",

    "abstract": "Maple sap is a complex nutrient matrix collected during Spring to produce maple syrup. The characteristics of sap change over the production period and its composition directly impacts syrup quality. This variability could in part be attributed to changes in tree metabolism following dormancy release, but little is known about these changes in deciduous trees. Therefore, understanding the variation in sap composition associated with dormancy release could help pinpoint the causes of some defects in maple syrup. In particular, a defect known as \\\"buddy\\\", is an increasing concern for the industry. This off-flavor appears around the time of bud burst, hence its name. To investigate sap variation related to bud burst and the buddy defect, we monitored sap variation with respect to a dormancy release index (Sbb) and syrup quality. First, we looked at variation in amino acid content during this period. We observed a shift in amino acid relative proportions associated with dormancy release and found that most of them increase rapidly near the point of bud burst, correlating with changes in syrup quality. Second, we identified biological processes that respond to variation in maple sap by performing a competition assay using the barcoded Saccharomyces cerevisiae prototroph deletion collection. This untargeted approach revealed that the organic sulfur content may be responsible for the development of the buddy off-flavor, and that dormancy release is necessary for the appearance of the defect, but other factors such as microbial activity may also be contributing.",

    "abstract": "Virtual (computational) high-throughput screening provides a strategy for prioritizing compounds for experimental screens, but the choice of virtual screening algorithm depends on the dataset and evaluation strategy. We consider a wide range of ligand-based machine learning and docking-based approaches for virtual screening on two protein-protein interactions, PriA-SSB and RMI-FANCM, and present a strategy for choosing which algorithm is best for prospective compound prioritization. Our workflow identifies a random forest as the best algorithm for these targets over more sophisticated neural network-based models. The top 250 predictions from our selected random forest recover 37 of the 54 active compounds from a library of 22,434 new molecules assayed on PriA-SSB. We show that virtual screening methods that perform well in public datasets and synthetic benchmarks, like multi-task neural networks, may not always translate to prospective screening performance on a specific assay of interest.",

    "abstract": "We study the role of a biomimetic actin cortex during the application of electric pulses that induce electroporation or electropermeabilization, using giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as a model system. The actin cortex, a subjacently attached interconnected network of actin filaments, regulates the shape and mechanical properties of the plasma membrane of mammalian cells, and is a major factor influencing the mechanical response of the cell to external physical cues. We demonstrate that the presence of an actin shell inhibits the formation of macropores in the electroporated GUVs. Additionally, experiments on the uptake of dye molecules after electroporation show that the actin network slows down the resealing process of the permeabilized membrane. We further analyze the stability of the actin network inside the GUVs exposed to high electric pulses. We find disruption of the actin layer that is likely due to the electrophoretic forces acting on the actin filaments during the permeabilization of the GUVs. Our findings on the GUVs containing a biomimetic cortex provide a step towards understanding the discrepancies between the electroporation mechanism of a living cell and its simplified model of the empty GUV.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput short-read sequencing has revolutionized how transcriptomes are quantified and annotated. However, while Illumina short-read sequencers can be used to analyze entire transcriptomes down to the level of individual splicing events with great accuracy, they fall short of analyzing how these individual events are combined into complete RNA transcript isoforms. Because of this shortfall, long-read sequencing is required to complement short-read sequencing to analyze transcriptomes on the level of full-length RNA transcript isoforms. However, there are issues with both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing technologies that prevent their widespread adoption. Briefly, PacBio sequencers produce low numbers of reads with high accuracy, while ONT sequencers produce higher numbers of reads with lower accuracy. Here we introduce and validate a new long-read ONT based sequencing method. At the same cost, our Rolling Circle Amplification to Concatemeric Consensus (R2C2) method generates more accurate reads of full-length RNA transcript isoforms than any other available long-read sequencing method. These reads can then be used to generate isoform-level transcriptomes for both genome annotation and differential expression analysis in bulk or single cell samples.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSubtle changes in RNA transcript isoform expression can have dramatic effects on cellular behaviors in both health and disease. As such, comprehensive and quantitative analysis of isoform-level transcriptomes would open an entirely new window into cellular diversity in fields ranging from developmental to cancer biology. The R2C2 method we are presenting here is the first method with sufficient throughput and accuracy to make the comprehensive and quantitative analysis of RNA transcript isoforms in bulk and single cell samples economically feasible.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt is widely accepted that the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) and early eukaryotes were intron-rich and intron loss dominated subsequent evolution, thus the presence of only very few introns in some modern eukaryotes must be the consequence of massive loss. But it is striking that few eukaryotes were found to have completely lost introns. Despite extensive research, the causes of massive intron losses remain elusive, and actually the reverse question - how the few introns are retained under the pressure of loss is equally significant but was rarely studied, except that it was conjectured that the essential functions of some introns prevent their loss. The extremely few (eight) spliceosome-mediated cis-spliced introns in the relatively simple genome of Giardia lamblia provide an excellent opportunity to explore this question.\\n\\nResultsOur investigation of the intron-containing genes and introns in Giardia found three types of intron distribution patterns: ancient intron in ancient gene, relatively new intron in ancient gene, and relatively new intron in relatively new gene, which can reflect to some extent the dynamic evolution of introns in Giardia. Not finding any special features or functional importance of these introns responsible for the retention, we noticed and experimentally verified that some intron-containing genes form sense-antisense gene pairs with functional genes on their complementary strands, and that the introns just reside in the overlapping regions.\\n\\nConclusionsIn Giardias evolution, despite constant pressure of intron loss, intron gain can still occur in both ancient and newly-evolved genes, but only a few introns have been retained; the evolutionary retention of introns is most likely not due to the functional constraint of the introns themselves but the causes outside of introns, such as the constraints imposed by other genomic functional elements overlapping with the introns. These findings can not only provide some clues to find new genomic functional elements -- in the areas overlapping with introngs, but suggest that \\\"functional constraint\\\" of introns may not be necessarily directly associated with intron loss and gain, or that the real functions or the way of functioning of introns are probably still outside of our current knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Theileria annulata is a tick-transmitted apicomplexan parasite that infects and transforms bovine leukocytes into disseminating tumors that cause a disease called tropical theileriosis. Using comparative transcriptomics we identified genes transcriptionally perturbed during Theileria-induced transformation. Dataset comparisons highlighted a small set of genes associated with Theileria-transformed leukocyte dissemination. The roles of Granzyme A (GZMA) and RAS guanyl-releasing protein 1 (RASGRP1) were verified by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-down. Knocking down of GZMA and RASGRP1 in attenuated macrophages led to a regain in their dissemination in Rag2/{gamma}C mice confirming their role as dissemination suppressors in vivo. We further evaluated the roles of GZMA and RASGRP1 in human B-lymphoma cells by comparing the transcriptome of 934 human cancer cell lines to that of Theileria-transformed bovine host cells. We confirmed dampened dissemination potential of human B-lymphoma cells that overexpress GZMA and RASGRP1. Our results provide evidence that GZMA and RASGRP1 have a novel tumor suppressor function in both T. annulata-infected bovine host cells and in human B-lymphomas.\\n\\nSummaryWe compared the transcriptomes of Theileria annulata transformed B-lymphocytes to 934 human cancer cell lines and provide functional evidence for shared tumor suppressor roles for GZMA and RASGRP1 in controlling the dissemination phenotype of both human B lymphomas and Theileria-transformed leukocytes.",
