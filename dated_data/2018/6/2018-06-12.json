    "abstract": "The vast majority of fitness-affecting mutations are deleterious. How natural populations evolve to cope is a question of fundamental interest. Previous studies have reported the evolution of mutational robustness, that is, natural selection favoring populations with less deleterious mutations. By definition, mutational robustness provides a short-term fitness advantage. However, this overlooks the fact that mutational robustness decreases finite asexual populations ability to purge recurrent deleterious mutations. Thus, mutational robustness also results in higher risk of long-term extinction by Mullers ratchet. Here, we explore the tension between short- and long- term response to deleterious mutations. We first show that populations can resist the ratchet if either the selection coefficient or the ratio of beneficial to deleterious mutations increases as fitness declines. We designate these properties as ratchet robustness, which fundamentally reflects a negative feedback between mutation rate and the tendency to accumulate more mutations. We also find in simulations that populations can evolve ratchet robustness when challenged by deleterious mutations. We conclude that mutational robustness cannot be selected for in the long term, but it can be favored in the short-term, purely because of temporary fitness advantage. We also discuss other potential causes of mutational robustness in nature.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of research, the exact ways in which the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) influences cognitive function have remained mysterious. Anatomically, the OFC is characterized by remarkably broad connectivity to sensory, limbic and subcortical areas, and functional studies have implicated the OFC in a plethora of functions ranging from facial processing to value-guided choice. Notwithstanding such diversity of findings, much research suggests that one important function of the OFC is to support decision making and reinforcement learning. Here, we describe a novel theory that posits that OFCs specific role in decision-making is to provide an up-to-date representation of task-related information, called a state representation. This representation reflects a mapping between distinct task states and sensory as well as unobservable information. We summarize evidence supporting the existence of such state representations in rodent and human OFC and argue that forming these state representations provides a crucial scaffold that allows animals to efficiently perform decision making and reinforcement learning in high-dimensional and partially observable environments. Finally, we argue that our theory offers an integrating framework for linking the diversity of functions ascribed to OFC and is in line with its wide ranging connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Computational prediction of cell type-specific, in-vivo transcription factor binding sites is still one of the central challenges in regulatory genomics, and a variety of approaches has been proposed for this purpose.\\n\\nHere, we present our approach that earned a shared first rank in the \\\"ENCODE-DREAM in vivo Transcription Factor Binding Site Prediction Challenge\\\" in 2017. This approach employs features derived from chromatin accessibility, binding motifs, gene expression, genomic sequence and annotation to train classifiers using a supervised, discriminative learning principle. Two further key aspects of this approach are learning classifier parameters in an iterative training procedure that successively adds additional negative examples to the training set, and creating an ensemble prediction by averaging over classifiers obtained for different training cell types.\\n\\nIn post-challenge analyses, we benchmark the influence of different feature sets and find that chromatin accessiblity and binding motifs are sufficient to yield state-of-the-art performance for in-vivo binding site predictions. We also show that the iterative training procedure and the ensemble prediction are pivotal for the final prediction performance.\\n\\nTo make predictions of this approach readily accessible, we predict 682 peak lists for a total of 31 transcription factors in 22 primary cell types and tissues, which are available for download at https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11526239, and we demonstrate that these may help to yield biological conclusions.

    "abstract": "During development, cell fate decisions are often highly stochastic, but with the frequency of the different possible fates tightly controlled. To understand how signaling networks control the cell fate frequency of such random decisions, we studied the stochastic decision of the Caenorhabditis elegans P3.p cell to either fuse to the hypodermis or assume vulva precursor cell fate. Using time-lapse microscopy to measure the single-cell dynamics of two key inhibitors of cell fusion, the Hox gene LIN-39 and Wnt signaling through the {beta}-catenin BAR-1, we uncovered significant variability in the dynamics of LIN-39 and BAR-1 levels. Most strikingly, we observed that BAR-1 accumulated in a single, 1-4 hour pulse at the time of the P3.p cell fate decision, with strong variability both in pulse slope and time of pulse onset. We found that the time of BAR-1 pulse onset was delayed relative to the time of cell fusion in mutants with low cell fusion frequency, linking BAR-1 pulse timing to cell fate outcome. Overall, a model emerged where animal-to-animal variability in LIN-39 levels and BAR-1 pulse dynamics biases cell fate by modulating their absolute level at the time cell fusion is induced. Our results highlight that timing of cell signaling dynamics, rather than its average level or amplitude, could play an instructive role in determining cell fate.\\n\\nArticle summaryWe studied the stochastic decision of the Caenorhabditis elegans P3.p cell to either fuse to the hypodermis or assume vulva precursor cell fate.

These projections rarely account for how temporal variation in temperature can systematically modify growth rates relative to projections based on constant temperatures. Here, we tested the hypothesis that population growth rates in fluctuating thermal environments differ from growth rates in constant conditions, and that the differing thermal performance curves (TPCs) can be predicted quantitatively. With experimental populations of the green alga Tetraselmis tetrahele, we show that nonlinear averaging techniques accurately predicted increased as well as decreased population growth rates in fluctuating thermal regimes relative to constant thermal regimes. We extrapolate from these results to project critical temperatures for population growth and persistence of 89 phytoplankton species in naturally variable thermal environments.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe use of the new genomic technologies has led to major advances in control of several arboviruses of medical importance such as Dengue. However, the development of tools and resources available for vectors of non-zoonotic arboviruses remains neglected. Biting midges of the genus Culicoides transmit some of the most important arboviruses of wildlife and livestock worldwide, with a global impact on economic productivity, health and welfare. The absence of a suitable reference genome has hindered genomic analyses to date in this important genus of vectors. In the present study, the genome of Culicoides sonorensis, a vector of bluetongue virus (BTV) in the USA, has been sequenced to provide the first reference genome for these vectors. In this study, we also report the use of the reference genome to perform initial transcriptomic analyses of vector competence for BTV.\\n\\nResultsOur analyses reveal that the genome is 197.4 Mb, assembled in 7,974 scaffolds. Its annotation using the transcriptomic data generated in this study and in a previous study has identified 15,629 genes. Gene expression analyses of C. sonorensis females infected with BTV performed in this study revealed 165 genes that were differentially expressed between vector competent and refractory females. Two candidate genes, glutathione S-transferase (gst) and the antiviral helicase ski2, previously recognized as involved in vector competence for BTV in C. sonorensis (gst) and repressing dsRNA virus propagation (ski2), were confirmed in this study.\\n\\nConclusionsThe reference genome of C. sonorensis has enabled preliminary analyses of the gene expression profiles of vector competent and refractory individuals. The genome and transcriptomes generated in this study provide suitable tools for future research on arbovirus transmission. These provide a significant resource for these vector lineage, which diverged from other major Dipteran vector families over 200 million years ago. The genome will be a valuable source of comparative data for other important Dipteran vector families including mosquitoes (Culicidae) and sandflies (Psychodidae), and yield potential targets for transgenic modification in vector control and functional studies.",

    "abstract": "Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) are the closest living relatives of humans, but they show distinct behavioral and physiological differences, particularly regarding female reproduction. Despite their recent rapid decline, the demographic histories of the two species have been different during the past one to two million years, likely having an impact on their genomic diversity. Here, we analyze the inferred functional consequences of genetic variation across 69 individuals, making use of the most complete dataset of genomic variation in the Pan clade to date. We test to which extent the demographic history influences the efficacy of purifying selection in these species. We find that small historical effective population sizes (Ne) correlate not only with small genetic diversity, but also with more homozygous deleterious alleles, and an increased proportion of deleterious changes at low frequencies. Furthermore, we exploit the catalog of deleterious protein-coding changes on each lineage to investigate the putative genetic basis for phenotypic differences between chimpanzees and bonobos. We show that bonobo-specific non-synonymous changes are enriched in genes related to age at menarche in humans, suggesting that the prominent physiological differences in the female reproductive system between chimpanzees and bonobos might be explained, in part, by putatively adaptive changes on the bonobo lineage.",

Since several physiological processes are involved and the relation among them is complicated, analyses of single-traits is insufficient in revealing the complex mechanism of altitude acclimatization. In this study, we examined whether these physiological responses could be studied as composite phenotypes which are represented by a linear combination of physiological traits. We developed a strategy which combines both spectral clustering and PLSPM to define composite phenotypes. We captured 14 composite phenotypes from 28 physiological traits of altitude acclimatization. Using these composite phenotypes, we applied k-means to reveal hidden physiological heterogeneity in altitude acclimatization. Furthermore, we employed linear regression to systematically model oxygen saturation (SpO2) changes in altitude acclimatization and evaluated the model fitness performance. And composite phenotypes based Model 2 has better fitness than single-traits based Model 1 in all measurement indices. Therefore, this new strategy of defining and applying composite phenotypes can be considered as a general strategy of complex traits.",

We show here that a three-layer network model predicts the retinal response to natural scenes with an accuracy nearing the fundamental limits of predictability. The models internal structure is interpretable, in that model units are highly correlated with interneurons recorded separately and not used to fit the model. We further show the ethological relevance to natural visual processing of a diverse set of phenomena of complex motion encoding, adaptation and predictive coding. Our analysis uncovers a fast timescale of visual processing that is inaccessible directly from experimental data, showing unexpectedly that ganglion cells signal in distinct modes by rapidly (< 0.1 s) switching their selectivity for direction of motion, orientation, location and the sign of intensity. A new approach that decomposes ganglion cell responses into the contribution of interneurons reveals how the latent effects of parallel retinal circuits generate the response to any possible stimulus. These results reveal extremely flexible and rapid dynamics of the retinal code for natural visual stimuli, explaining the need for a large set of interneuron pathways to generate the dynamic neural code for natural scenes.",

Our estimates provided evidence of long-term population declines in all California S. occidentalis populations. We found no evidence of genetic differentiation between northern spotted owl (S. o. caurina) populations in the counties of Marin and Humboldt in California. We estimated greater differentiation between populations at the northern and southern extremes of the range of the California spotted owl (S. o. occidentalis) than between populations of S. o. occidentalis and S. o. caurina in northern California. The San Diego County S. o. occidentalis population was substantially diverged from the other three S. occidentalis populations.

    "abstract": "Despite widespread vaccination, eleven thousand mumps cases were reported in the United States (US) in 2016-17, including hundreds in Massachusetts, primarily in college settings. We generated 203 whole genome mumps virus (MuV) sequences from Massachusetts and 15 other states to understand the dynamics of mumps spread locally and nationally, as well as to search for variants potentially related to vaccination. We observed multiple MuV lineages circulating within Massachusetts during 2016-17, evidence for multiple introductions of the virus to the state, and extensive geographic movement of MuV within the US on short time scales. We found no evidence that variants arising during this outbreak contributed to vaccine escape. Combining epidemiological and genomic data, we observed multiple co-circulating clades within individual universities as well as spillover into the local community. Detailed data from one well-sampled university allowed us to estimate an effective reproductive number within that university significantly greater than one. We also used publicly available small hydrophobic (SH) gene sequences to estimate migration between world regions and to place this outbreak in a global context, but demonstrate that these short sequences, historically used for MuV genotyping, are inadequate for tracing detailed transmission. Our findings suggest continuous, often undetected, circulation of mumps both locally and nationally, and highlight the value of combining genomic and epidemiological data to track viral disease transmission at high resolution.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe crucian carp (Carassius carassius) is one of few fish species associated with small ponds in the UK. These populations contain genetic diversity not found in Europe and are important to conservation efforts for the species, which has declined across its range. Detection and monitoring of extant crucian carp populations are crucial for conservation success. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis could be very useful in this respect as a rapid, cost-efficient monitoring tool.\\nC_LIO_LIWe developed a species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for eDNA surveillance of crucian carp to enable non-invasive, large-scale distribution monitoring. We compared fyke netting and eDNA at ponds with (N = 10) and without (N = 10) crucian carp for presence-absence detection and relative abundance estimation, specifically whether DNA copy number reflected catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) estimate. We examined biotic and abiotic influences on eDNA detection and quantification, and compared qPCR to standard PCR. Notably, eDNA occurrence and detection probabilities in relation to biotic and abiotic factors were estimated using a hierarchical occupancy model.\\nC_LIO_LIeDNA analysis achieved 90% detection for crucian carp (N = 10), failing in only one pond where presence was known. We observed an overall positive trend between DNA copy number and CPUE estimate, but this was not significant. Macrophyte cover decreased the probability of eDNA occurrence at ponds, whereas CPUE and conductivity had positive and negative influences on eDNA detection probability in qPCR replicates respectively. Conductivity also had a negative effect on DNA copy number, but copy number increased with temperature and percentage of macrophyte cover. PCR was comparable to qPCR for species detection and may provide semi-quantitative information.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results demonstrate that eDNA could enable detection of crucian carp populations in ponds and benefit ongoing conservation efforts, but imperfect species detection in relation to biotic and abiotic factors and eDNA workflow requires further investigation. Nonetheless, we have established an eDNA framework for crucian carp and sources of imperfect detection which future investigations can build upon.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Overexpression of multidrug resistance efflux pumps is a relevant mechanism of antibiotic resistance for bacterial pathogens. These systems use to present low levels of basal expression. However, they can be induced by environmental signals or stresses which can lead to situations of phenotypic induced resistance. In contrast to efflux pumps substrates, inducers of these systems have not been thoroughly studied. In this work, we have applied a novel high-throughput methodology in order to identify inducer molecules of the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia SmeVWX and SmeYZ efflux pumps. To that goal, bioreporters in which the expression of the yellow fluorescent protein is linked to the activity of either the smeVWX or the smeYZ promoters were developed and used for the screening of potential inducers of the expression of these efflux pumps using Biolog phenotype microarrays. Confirmation of induction was carried out measuring YFP production along the bacterial growth and by flow cytometry; mRNA levels of smeV and smeY were also determined by real-time RT-PCR after exposure to the selected compounds. Among the 144 tested compounds, iodoacetate, clioquinol (5-chloro-7-iodo-8-hydroxyquinoline) and sodium selenite were found to be smeVWX inducers, while boric acid, erythromycin, chloramphenicol and lincomycin are able to trigger the expression of smeYZ. While the presence of the inducers allowed a decrease in the susceptibility to antibiotics that are known substrates of the efflux pumps, our results indicate that these efflux pumps did not contribute to S. maltophilia resistance to the analyzed inducers.\\n\\nImportanceMultidrug efflux pumps constitute a category of elements involved in the cellular response to stress that is universally represented; from bacteria to human cells. Besides playing basic roles in cell physiology, these elements are critical elements in the resistance to therapeutic agents, including anti-cancer drugs, antifungals and antibiotics. Stable-inheritable resistance is achieved through mutations in regulatory elements that allow overexpression of these systems. However, much less is known on the effectors, or growing conditions, that might induce their expression, leading to a situation of transient-phenotypic resistance, not detectable by current susceptibility tests, unless the inducer in known. Herein we present a methodology amenable for the high-throughput screening of efflux pumps inducers. The use of phenotype microarrays linked to fluorescence reporters have allowed to identify a set of different inducers for smeVWX and smeYZ. Notably, induction seems to be uncoupled from the detoxification of the inducers by the corresponding efflux pumps. The mechanism of action of each of the inducers for inhibiting bacterial growth allowed us to propose that smeVWX is likely induced as a response to thiol-reactive compounds, while smeYZ is induced by ribosome-targeting antimicrobials. Although applied to a specific bacterium, this method is of application to any type of organism and efflux pump, changing the growing conditions in the case of eukaryotic cells. Since the presence of inducers may change the cell response to therapeutic drugs, the identification of these molecules is of clinical relevance.",

In the present study, we evaluated the activities of multiple interosseous hand-muscles which densely located in the hand, through analyzing the surface electromyographic signals during finger-oriented tasks using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Ten healthy subjects participated in our experiment, and isometrically exercised each finger one by one in flexed form. The result of a univariate analysis with the power and amplitude domain predictor variables of the surface electromyographic signals showed significant consistency between the activated finger and the inserted finger of the dorsal interosseous muscles to the proximal phalanx (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, the results of a multivariate analysis showed a higher correlation of the regression model of the fourth dorsal interosseous muscle during the action of the ring finger using frequency-domain variables (the Nagelkerke R2 = 0.716 when the median frequency was used), compared to the model without the frequency-domain variables (the Nagelkerke R2 = 0.583). Our result showed that the logistic regression models have a particular possibility for the analysis of the surface electromyographic signals of densely located hand-muscle activities related to the finger-oriented tasks.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide. Early metastasis and the recurrence remain major challenges for lung cancer treatment in clinic. Targeting the cancer stemness could be a potential strategy to restrain tumor progression. In the current study, we found that in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC), BMI1 and MCL1 play crucial roles in invasion, chemo-resistance, and tumor initiation. JNK signaling is a link between oncogenic pathway or environment stress to cancer stemness. The activation of JNK, either by EGFR or chemotherapy agent, stabilized BMI1 and MCL1 proteins through suppressing the expression of E3-ubiquitin ligase HUWE1. In lung cancer patient samples, high level of BMI1 is correlated with poor survival, and the expression of BMI1 is positively correlated with MCL1. A novel small-molecule BI-44 was synthesized, which effectively suppressed BMI1/MCL1 expression and inhibited tumor formation and progression in preclinical models. Targeting BMI1/MCL1 provides the basis for a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of LAC.",

    "abstract": "High frequency repetitive TMS (HF-rTMS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an approved option for the treatment of depression, but there is also much variability in the resulting antidepressant response. This variability is believed to arise from various factors, an important one of which being the method by which rTMS is targeted to the optimal stimulation site in the left DLPFC. To more accurately target HF-rTMS at left DLPFC, we present a new method for target selection based on individual RS-fMRI data. We show in 23 healthy subjects that the new proposed method of target selection is reproducible and yields left DLPFC targets whose functional connectivity correlates more negatively with subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) than targets based on standard MNI coordinates. Since previous work has highlighted higher negative connectivity with the sgACC as an important feature of targets for higher antidepressant effect of HF-rTMS, the targets selected by the new method can be expected to lead to a higher therapeutic response. Additionally, the mechanism of action of an entire single session of HF-rTMS (3000 pulses) in healthy subjects has not been reported. We show significant decreases in functional connectivity of the default mode network in sgACC and ventral striatum (vStr) regions, peaking at 27-32 minutes after stimulation. Also, we report a negative correlation between the magnitude of this decrease in the right sgACC and the harm avoidance domain measure from the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). This finding points towards the possibility of using the harm avoidance measure as a predictor of HF-rTMS response. In addition, the decreased functional connectivity of the default mode network in right nucleus accumbens (NAcc) correlates with a short-term decrease in self-rated negative emotions from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) i.e. the lower the functional connectivity of right NAcc with the default mode network, the lower the reported perception of negative mood by the subjects. This suggests a mechanism by which changes induced by rTMS influence the perception of negative mood in recipients.",

    "abstract": "Modulation is essential for adjusting neurons to prevailing conditions and differing demands. Yet understanding how modulators adjust neuronal properties to alter information processing remains unclear, as is the impact of neuromodulation on energy consumption. Here we combine two computational models, one Hodgkin-Huxley type and the other analytic, to investigate the effects of neuromodulation upon Drosophila melanogaster photoreceptors. Voltage-dependent K+ conductances: (i) activate upon depolarisation to reduce membrane resistance and adjust bandwidth to functional requirements; (ii) produce negative feedback to increase bandwidth in an energy efficient way; (iii) produce shunt-peaking thereby increasing the membrane gain bandwidth product; and (iv) inactivate to amplify low frequencies. Through their effects on the voltage-dependent K+ conductances, three modulators, serotonin, calmodulin and PIP2, trade-off contrast gain against membrane bandwidth. Serotonin shifts the photoreceptor performance towards higher contrast gains and lower membrane bandwidths, whereas PIP2 and calmodulin shift performance towards lower contrast gains and higher membrane bandwidths. These neuromodulators have little effect upon the overall energy consumed by photoreceptors, instead they redistribute the energy invested in gain versus bandwidth. This demonstrates how modulators can shift neuronal information processing within the limitations of biophysics and energy consumption.",

    "abstract": "Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, it has been difficult to compare the complex brain activity between simulated and empirical data. Previous studies have used simple metrics that surmise coordination between regions such as functional connectivity, and we extend on this by using various different dynamical analysis tools that are currently used to understand resting state fMRI. We show that certain properties correspond to the structural connectivity input that is shared between the models, and certain dynamic properties relate more to the mathematical description of the Brain Network Model. We conclude that the dynamic properties that gauge more temporal structure rather than spatial coordination in the rs-fMRI signal seem to provide the largest contrasts between different BNMs and the unknown empirical dynamical system.

    "abstract": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) develop thrombotic abnormalities strongly associated with cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the changes of numerous coagulation factors such as elevated levels of thrombin and fibrinogen, the abnormal rheological effects of red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets flowing in blood are crucial in platelet adhesion and thrombus formation in T2DM. An important process contributing to the latter is the platelet margination. We employ the dissipative particle dynamics method to seamlessly model cells, plasma, and vessel walls. We perform a systematic study on the RBC and platelet transport in cylindrical vessels by considering different cell shapes, sizes and RBC deformabilities in healthy and T2DM blood, as well as variable flowrates and hematocrit. In particular, we use cellular-level RBC and platelet models with parameters derived from patient-specific data and present a sensitivity study. We find T2DM RBCs, which are less deformable compared to normal RBCs, lower the transport of platelets toward the vessel walls whereas platelets with higher mean volume (often observed in T2DM) lead to enhanced margination. Furthermore, increasing the flowrate or hematocrit enhances platelet margination. We also investigated the effect of platelet shape and observed a non-monotonic variation with the highest near-wall concentration corresponding to platelets with moderate aspect ratio of 0.38. We examine the role of white blood cells (WBCs), whose count is increased notably in T2DM patients. We find that WBC rolling or WBC adhesion tend to decrease platelet margination due to hydrodynamic effects. To the best of our knowledge, such simulations of blood including all blood cells have not been performed before, and our quantitative findings can help separate the effects of hydrodynamic interactions from adhesive interactions, and potentially shed light on the associated pathological processes in T2DM such as increased inflammatory response, platelet activation and adhesion, and ultimately thrombus formation.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt)1 is a cytoprotective signaling pathway triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction. Activation of the UPRmt upregulates nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, including those for chaperones, proteases, and antioxidants, as well as glycolysis, to restore proteostasis and cell energetics. Activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5), a protein with both mitochondrial and nuclear targeting sequences, is proposed to mediate mammalian UPRmt signaling. Since proteostasis and bioenergetics are important in the response of organs such as the heart to injury, we hypothesized that pharmacologic UPRmt activation may be cardioprotective against ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury and that such protection would require ATF5. Using a perfused heart IR injury model in wild-type and global Atf5-/- mice, we found that in-vivo administration of the UPRmt inducers oligomycin or doxycycline 6 h prior to ex-vivo IR injury was cardioprotective. Such protection was absent in hearts from Atf5-/- mice, and no protection was observed with acute ex-vivo cardiac administration of doxycycline. Loss of ATF5 also did not alter baseline IR injury (without UPRmt induction). Cardiac gene expression analysis by RNA-Seq revealed mild induction of numerous genes in an ATF5-dependent manner, which may be important for cardioprotection. Analysis of hearts by qPCR showed that oligomycin at 6 h significantly induced genes encoding ATF5 and several known UPRmt-linked proteins. We conclude that ATF5 is required for cardioprotection induced by drugs that activate the UPRmt.",

    "abstract": "The role of species divergence due to ecologically-based divergent selection - or ecological speciation - in generating and maintaining biodiversity is a central question in evolutionary biology. Comparison of the genomes of phylogenetically related taxa spanning a selective habitat gradient enables discovery of divergent signatures of selection and thereby provides valuable insight into the role of divergent ecological selection in speciation. Tidal marsh ecosystems provide tractable opportunities for studying organisms adaptations to selective pressures that underlie ecological divergence. Sharp environmental gradients across the saline-freshwater ecotone within tidal marshes present extreme adaptive challenges to terrestrial vertebrates. Here we sequence 20 whole genomes of two avian sister species endemic to tidal marshes - the Saltmarsh Sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus) and Nelsons Sparrow (A. nelsoni) - to evaluate the influence of selective and demographic processes in shaping genome-wide patterns of divergence. Genome-wide divergence between these two recently diverged sister species was notably high (genome-wide FST = 0.32). Against a background of high genome-wide divergence, regions of elevated divergence were widespread throughout the genome, as opposed to focused within islands of differentiation. These patterns may be the result of genetic drift acting during past tidal march colonization events in addition to divergent selection to different environments. We identified several candidate genes that exhibited elevated divergence between Saltmarsh and Nelsons sparrows, including genes linked to osmotic regulation, circadian rhythm, and plumage melanism - all putative candidates linked to adaptation to tidal marsh environments. These findings provide new insights into the roles of divergent selection and genetic drift in generating and maintaining biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "In Drosophila, 23-30 nt long PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) direct the protein Piwi to silence germline transposon transcription. Most germline piRNAs derive from dual-strand piRNA clusters, heterochromatic transposon graveyards that are transcribed from both genomic strands. These piRNA sources are marked by the Heterochromatin Protein 1 homolog, Rhino (Rhi), which facilitates their promoter-independent transcription, suppresses splicing, and inhibits transcriptional termination. Here, we report that the protein Maelstrom (Mael) represses canonical, promoter-dependent transcription in dual-strand clusters, allowing Rhi to initiate piRNA precursor transcription. In addition to Mael, the piRNA biogenesis factors Armitage and Piwi, but not Rhi, are required to repress canonical transcription in dual-strand clusters. We propose that Armitage, Piwi, and Mael collaborate to repress potentially dangerous transcription of individual transposon mRNAs within clusters, while Rhi allows non-canonical transcription of the clusters into piRNA precursors without generating transposase-encoding mRNAs.",

    "abstract": "MotivationDetermining RNA binding protein(RBP) binding specificity is crucial for understanding many cellular processes and genetic disorders. RBP binding is known to be affected by both the sequence and structure of RNAs. Deep learning can be used to learn generalizable representations of raw data and has improved state of the art in several fields such as image classification, speech recognition and even genomics. Previous work on RBP binding has either used shallow models that combine sequence and structure or deep models that use only the sequence. Here we combine both abilities by augmenting and refining the original Deepbind architecture to capture structural information and obtain significantly better performance.\\n\\nResultsWe propose two deep architectures, one a lightweight convolutional network for transcriptome wide inference and another a Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) network that is suitable for small batches of data. We incorporate computationally predicted secondary structure features as input to our models and show its effectiveness in boosting prediction performance. Our models achieved significantly higher correlations on held out in-vitro test data compared to previous approaches, and generalise well to in-vivo CLIP-SEQ data achieving higher median AUCs than other approaches. We analysed the output from our model for VTS1 and CPO and provided intuition into its working. Our models confirmed known secondary structure preferences for some proteins as well as found new ones where secondary structure might play a role. We also demonstrated the strengths of our model compared to other approaches such as the ability to combine information from long distances along the input.\\n\\nAvailabilitySoftware and models are available at https://github.com/shreshthgandhi/cDeepbind\\n\\nContactljlee@psi.toronto.edu, frey@psi.toronto.edu",

    "abstract": "While robust regulatory mechanisms are expected to control the production of splice variants that confer distinct functions, a low level of stochasticity may be tolerated. To investigate stringency of regulation, we followed changes in the splicing of 192 alternative cassette exons after growth of cancer-derived HCT116 cells and embryonic colonocytes. In both cell lines approximately 15% of alternative splicing events changed by more than 10 percentage points over a 42-day period. We then carried out a cycle of transient depletions targeting RNPS1, a splicing regulator implicated in genomic stability. For alternative splicing units not regulated by RNPS1, the level of splicing changes was similar to the stochastic value obtained after normal growth. However, the frequency of perdurable changes was at least twice that value for splicing events regulated by RNPS1. A swap allele assay performed on four RNPS1-responsive units that underwent splicing changes indicated the presence of mutations mediating this effect. Specifically, a T to C mutation in a RNPS1-responsive exon of ADARB1 confered exon skipping. Our results suggest that fluctuations in the level of a splicing regulator preferentially impact the integrity of genes encoding transcripts that are regulated by this splicing factor to produce perdurable changes in alternative splicing. We discuss the potential implication of this process in human evolution.",

For this, fast replays of previously experienced activities during sleep or after reward experiences are believed to be crucial. But how such replays are generated is still completely unclear. In this paper we propose a possible mechanism for this: we present a model that can store experienced trajectories on a behavioral timescale after a single run, and can subsequently bidirectionally replay such trajectories, thereby omitting any specifics of the previous behavior like speed, etc, but allowing repetitions of events, even with different subsequent events. Our solution builds on well-known concepts, one-shot learning and synfire chains, enhancing them by additional mechanisms using global inhibition and disinhibition. For replays our approach relies on dendritic spikes and cholinergic modulation, as supported by experimental data. We also hypothesize a functional role of disinhibition as a pacemaker during behavioral time.",

Minimal genomes are ideal for this purpose as they have a very simple functional assay, the cell can either replicate or not. We used the first (and currently only published) whole-cell model, for the bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium 1. Our computational design-simulate-test cycles discovered novel in-silico minimal genomes smaller than JCVI-Syn3.0 2, a bacterial cell with the currently known smallest genome that can be grown in pure culture. In the process, we identified 10 low essentiality genes, 18 high essentiality genes 3, and produced evidence for at least two minimal genomes for Mycoplasma genitalium in-silico.

    "abstract": "Pheromones known as cuticular hydrocarbons are a major component of reproductive isolation in Drosophila. Individuals from morphologically similar sister species produce different sets of hydrocarbons that allow potential mates to identify them as a suitable partner. In order to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying speciation, we performed RNA-seq in F1 hybrids to measure tissue-specific cis-regulatory divergence between the sister species D. simulans and D. sechellia. By focusing on cis-regulatory changes specific to female oenocytes, we rapidly identified a small number of candidate genes. We found that one of these, the fatty acid elongase eloF, broadly affects both the complement of hydrocarbons present on D. sechellia females and the propensity of D. simulans males to mate with those females. In addition, knockdown of eloF in the more distantly related D. melanogaster led to a similar shift in hydrocarbons as well as lower interspecific mate discrimination by D. simulans males. Thus, cis-regulatory changes in eloF appear to be a major driver in the sexual isolation of D. simulans from multiple other species. More generally, our RNA-seq approach proved to be far more efficient than QTL mapping in identifying candidate genes; the same framework can be used to pinpoint cis-regulatory drivers of divergence in a wide range of traits differing between any interfertile species.",

    "abstract": "Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) create unparalleled levels of protein sequence variation through mutagenic retrohoming. Sequence information is transferred from an invariant template region (TR), through an RNA intermediate, to a protein-coding variable region. Selective infidelity at adenines during transfer is a hallmark of DGRs from disparate bacteria, archaea, and microbial viruses. We recapitulated selective infidelity in vitro for the prototypical Bordetella bacteriophage DGR. A complex of the DGR reverse transcriptase bRT and pentameric accessory variability determinant (Avd) protein along with DGR RNA were necessary and sufficient for synthesis of template-primed, covalently linked RNA-cDNA molecules, as observed in vivo. We identified RNAcDNA molecules to be branched and most plausibly linked through 2'-5' phosphodiester bonds. Adenine-mutagenesis was intrinsic to the bRT-Avd complex, which displayed unprecedented promiscuity while reverse transcribing adenines of either DGR or non-DGR RNA templates. In contrast, bRT-Avd processivity was strictly dependent on the template, occurring only for the DGR RNA. This restriction was mainly due to a noncoding segment downstream of TR, which specifically bound Avd and created a privileged site for processive polymerization. Restriction to DGR RNA may protect the host genome from damage. These results define the early steps in a novel pathway for massive sequence diversification.",

The mechanical properties of these bundles are critical for proper force transmission and force bearing. Previous mathematical modeling efforts have focused on bundles rigidity and shape. However, it remains unknown how bundle length and thickness are controlled by external physical factors, and how the attachment of the bundle to a load affects its ability to transmit forces. In this paper, we present a biophysical model for dynamic bundles of actin filaments that takes into account individual filaments, their interaction with each other and with an external load. In combination with in vitro motility assays of beads coated with formins, our model allowed us to characterize conditions for bead movement and bundle buckling. From the deformation profiles, we determined key biophysical properties of tethered actin bundles, such as their rigidity and filament density. Our model also demonstrated that filaments undulate under lateral constraints applied by external forces or by neighboring filaments of the bundle. Last, our model allowed us to identify optimum conditions in filament density and barbed end tethering to the load for a maximal yield of mechanical power by a dynamic actin bundle.",

EV71 is transmitted by the enteral route, but very little is known about the mechanisms it utilizes to cross the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Using primary human intestinal epithelial monolayers, we show that EV71 infects the GI epithelium from the apical surface, where it preferentially infects goblet cells. Unlike echovirus 11 (E11), an enterovirus that infects enterocytes, EV71 infection did not alter epithelial barrier function, but did reduce the expression of a goblet cell-derived mucin, suggesting it alters goblet cell function. We also show that the intestinal epithelium responds to EV71 infection through the selective induction of type III IFNs, which potently restrict EV71 replication. Collectively, these findings define the early events associated with EV71 infections of the human intestinal epithelium and show that host IFN signaling controls replication in an IFN-specific manner.",

However, it remains unclear how morphology affects movement coordination in animals independent of neuronal activity. To begin to understand this issue, this study reports a rhythmic movement in the green brittle star. We found this animal moved five radially symmetric parts in a well-ordered unsynchronized pattern. We explained the coordinated pattern without considering neuronal activity, by building a phenomenological model where internal fluid flows between the body parts. Changing the number of body parts from five to six simulated a synchronized pattern, which is also demonstrated by a rare individual with six symmetric parts. This model suggests the different number in morphology changes the symmetry of the fluid flow, leading to the different synchronization patterns.",

These risks arise from the need for PCR amplification to detect the trace amounts of DNA combined with the necessity of using short target regions due to DNA degradation.\n\nFindingsOur high-throughput workflow minimises these risks via a four-step strategy: (1) technical replication with two PCR replicates and two extraction replicates; (2) using multi-markers (12S, 16S, CytB); (3) a  twin-tagging, two-step PCR protocol;(4) use of the probabilistic taxonomic assignment method PROTAX, which can account for incomplete reference databases.\n\nAs annotation errors in the reference sequences can result in taxonomic mis-assignment, we supply a protocol for curating sequence datasets. For some taxonomic groups and some markers, curation resulted in over 50% of sequences being deleted from public reference databases, due to (1) limited overlap between our target amplicon and reference sequences; (2) mislabelling of reference sequences; (3) redundancy.\n\nFinally, we provide a bioinformatic pipeline to process amplicons and conduct PROTAX assignment and tested it on an  invertebrate derived DNA (iDNA) dataset from 1532 leeches from Sabah, Malaysia. Twin-tagging allowed us to detect and exclude sequences with non-matching tags. The smallest DNA fragment (16S) amplified most frequently for all samples, but was less powerful for discriminating at species rank. Using a stringent and lax acceptance criteria we found 162 (stringent) and 190 (lax) vertebrate detections of 95 (stringent) and 109 (lax) leech samples.\n\nConclusionsOur metabarcoding workflow should help research groups increase the robustness of their results and therefore facilitate wider usage of e/iDNA, which is turning into a valuable source of ecological and conservation information on tetrapods.",

However, relating single-synapse release events and local astroglial responses to sensory stimuli in an intact animal has not hitherto been feasible. Here, we present a multiplexed multiphoton excitation imaging approach for assessing the relationship between presynaptic Ca2+ entry at thalamocortical axonal boutons and perisynaptic astrocytic Ca2+ elevations, induced by whisker stimulation in the barrel cortex of C57BL/6 mice. We find that, unexpectedly, Ca2+ elevations in the perisynaptic astrocytic regions consistently precede local presynaptic Ca2+ signals during spontaneous brain activity associated with anaesthesia.

    "abstract": "1.BackgroundNeuropsychiatric disease has polygenic determinants but is often precipitated by environmental pressures, including adverse perinatal events. However, the way in which genetic vulnerability and early-life adversity interact remains obscure. Preterm birth is associated with abnormal brain development and psychiatric disease. We hypothesised that the extreme environmental stress of premature extra-uterine life could contribute to neuroanatomic abnormality in genetically vulnerable individuals.\\n\\nMethodsWe combined Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from 194 infants, born before 33 weeks of gestation, to test the prediction that: the characteristic deep grey matter abnormalities seen in preterm infants are associated with polygenic risk for psychiatric illness. Summary statistics from a meta-analysis of SNP data for five psychiatric disorders were used to compute individual polygenic risk scores (PRS). The variance explained by the PRS in the relative volumes of four deep grey matter structures (caudate nucleus, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus and lentiform nucleus) was estimated using linear regression both for the full, mixed-ancestral, cohort and a subsample of European infants.\\n\\nResultsThe PRS was negatively associated with: lentiform volume in the full cohort ({beta}=-0.24, p=8x10-4) and the European subsample ({beta}=-0.24, p=8x10-3); and with subthalamic nuclear volume in the full cohort ({beta}=-0.18, p=0.01) and the European subsample ({beta}=-0.26, p=3x10-3).\\n\\nConclusionsGenetic variants associated with neuropsychiatric disease increase vulnerability to abnormal deep grey matter development and are associated with neuroanatomic changes in the perinatal period. This suggests a mechanism by which perinatal adversity leads to later neuropsychiatric disease in genetically predisposed individuals.",

The truncated c-terminus of the BMPR2 protein is known to increase the phosphorylation and downstream activity of SRC tyrosine kinases. To test the hypothesis that the inhibition of SRC can prevent heritable PAH due to a BMPR2 mutation, we exposed BMPR2 mutant mice to SRC inhibitors, saracatinib and dasatinib, to block the SRC activation caused by the BMPR2 mutation. Saracatinib and dasatinib failed to prevent the development of PAH in BMPR2 mutant mice. Increased pressure in the right ventricle was not normalized and muscularization of large blood vessels was not reduced when compared to wild type mice. Inhibiting SRCs phosphorylation does not prevent heritable PAH, and thus supports evidence that SRCs aberrant localization and trafficking in PAH plays a more critical role in disease development.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism of activation and ubiquitin conjugation by the E3 ligase parkin is pivotal to understand the molecular pathology of early-onset Parkinsons disease. Parkin is normally autoinhibited but is activated by the kinase PINK1 that phosphorylates parkins N-terminal ubiquitin-like (pUbl) domain and ubiquitin. How these alter the structure of parkin to allow recruitment of an E2~Ub conjugate to enhance ubiquitination is an unresolved question. We present the structure of an incoming E2~Ub conjugate with the phospho-ubiquitin bound C-terminus of parkin (R0RBR). We show the UbcH7~Ub conjugate is recruited by R0RBR parkin in the open state whereby conjugated ubiquitin binds to the RING1/IBR interface. Further, NMR experiments indicate there is re-modelling near the RING0/RING2 interface remote from the E2-binding site. This, and parkin phosphorylation lead to rapid reactivity of the RING2(Rcat) catalytic cysteine in parkin, needed for ubiquitin transfer. Parkin phosphorylation also leads to relocation and weak interaction of the pUbl domain with the RING0 domain that is enhanced upon E2~Ub recruitment indicating these events act synergistically to drive parkin activity.",

Previously, we found that migration of melanoma cells is associated with and dependent on global chromatin condensation that includes a global increase in these markers. Taken together with more recent reports by others suggest it is a general signature of migrating cells. Here, to learn about the function of these markers in migrating cells we mapped them by ChIP-seq analysis. This analysis revealed that induction of migration leads to expansion of these markers along the genome and to an increased overlapping between them. Significantly, induction of migration led to a higher increase in H3K9me3 and H4K20me1 signals at repetitive elements than at protein-coding genes, while an opposite pattern was found for H3K27me3. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 182 altered genes following induction of migration, of which 33% are dependent on H3K27me3 for these changes. H3K27me3 was also required to prevent changes in the expression of 501 other genes upon induction of migration. Taken together our results suggest that heterochromatinization in migrating cells is global and not restricted to specific genomic loci and that H3K27me3 is a key component in executing a migration-specific transcriptional plan.",

    "abstract": "Replicative senescence hampers application of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) because it limits culture expansion, impairs differentiation potential, and hinders reliable standardization of cell products. MSCs can be rejuvenated by reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which is associated with complete erasure of age- and senescence-associated DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns. However, this process is also associated with erasure of cell-type and tissue-specific epigenetic characteristics that are not recapitulated upon re-differentiation towards MSCs. In this study, we therefore followed the hypothesis that overexpression of pluripotency factors under culture conditions that do not allow full reprogramming might reset senescence-associated changes without entering a pluripotent state. MSCs were transfected with episomal plasmids and either successfully reprogrammed into iPSCs or cultured in different media with continuous passaging every week. Overexpression of pluripotency factors without reprogramming did neither prolong culture expansion nor ameliorate molecular and epigenetic hallmarks of senescence. Notably, transfection resulted in immortalization of one cell preparation with gain of large parts of the long arm of chromosome 1. Taken together, premature termination of reprogramming does not result in rejuvenation of MSCs and harbours the risk of transformation. This approach is therefore not suitable to rejuvenate cells for cellular therapy.",

Results from the simulation studies showed that BALLI correctly controlled the type-1 error rates at the various nominal significance levels, and produced better statistical power and precision estimates than those of other competing methods in various scenarios. Furthermore, BALLI was robust to variation of library size.

    "abstract": "We examine the problem of clustering biomolecular simulations using deep learning techniques. Since biomolecular simulation datasets are inherently high dimensional, it is often necessary to build low dimensional representations that can be used to extract quantitative insights into the atomistic mechanisms that underlie complex biological processes. In this paper, we use a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to learn low dimensional, biophysically relevant latent features from long time-scale protein folding simulations in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate our approach on three model protein folding systems, namely the Fs-peptide (14 s aggregate sampling), villin head piece (single trajectory of 125 s) and the mixed {beta}-{beta}- (BBA) protein (223 + 102 s sampling across two independent trajectories). In these systems, we show that the CVAE latent features learned correspond to distinct conformational substates along the protein folding pathways. The CVAE model predicts nearly 89% of all contacts within the folding trajectories correctly, while being able to extract folded, unfolded and potentially misfolded states in an unsupervised manner. Further, the CVAE model can be used to learn latent features of protein folding that can be applied to other independent trajectories, making it particularly attractive for identifying intrinsic features that correspond to conformational substates that share similar structural features. Together, we show that the CVAE model can quantitatively describe complex biophysical processes such as protein folding.",

    "abstract": "When testing genotype-phenotype associations using linear regression, departure of the trait distribution from normality can impact both Type I error rate control and statistical power, with worse consequences for rarer variants. While it has been shown that applying a rank-normalization transformation to trait values before testing may improve these statistical properties, the factor driving them is not the trait distribution itself, but its residual distribution after regression on both covariates and genotype. Because genotype is expected to have a small effect (if any) investigators now routinely use a two-stage method, in which they first regress the trait on covariates, obtain residuals, rank-normalize them, and then secondly use the rank-normalized residuals in association analysis with the genotypes. Potential confounding signals are assumed to be removed at the first stage, so in practice no further adjustment is done in the second stage. Here, we show that this widely-used approach can lead to tests with undesirable statistical properties, due to both a combination of a mis-specified mean-variance relationship, and remaining covariate associations between the rank-normalized residuals and genotypes. We demonstrate these properties theoretically, and also in applications to genome-wide and whole-genome sequencing association studies. We further propose and evaluate an alternative fully-adjusted two-stage approach that adjusts for covariates both when residuals are obtained, and in the subsequent association test. This method can reduce excess Type I errors and improve statistical power.",

    "abstract": "Marine viruses impact global biogeochemical cycles via their influence on host community structure and function, yet our understanding of viral ecology is constrained by limitations in culturing of important hosts and the lack of a  universal gene to facilitate community surveys. Short-read viral metagenomic studies have provided clues to viral function and first estimates of global viral gene abundance and distribution. However, short-read assemblies are confounded by populations with high levels of strain evenness and nucleotide diversity (microdiversity), limiting assembly of some of the most abundant viruses on Earth. Assembly across genomic islands which likely contain niche-defining genes that drive ecological speciation is also challenging. While such populations and features are successfully captured by single-virus genomics and fosmid-based approaches, both techniques require considerable cost and technical expertise. Here we established a low-cost, low-input, high throughput alternative method for improving assembly of viral metagenomics using long read technology. Named  VirION (Viral, long-read metagenomics via MinION sequencing), our sequencing approach and complementary bioinformatics pipeline (i) increased number and completeness of assembled viral genomes compared to short-read sequencing methods; (ii) captured populations of abundant viruses with high microdiversity missed by short-read methods and (iii) captured more and longer genomic islands than short-read methods. Thus, VirION provides a high throughput and cost-effective alternative to fosmid and single-virus genomic approaches to more comprehensively explore viral communities in nature.",

    "abstract": "Activation of naive CD8 T-cells can lead to the generation of multiple effector and memory subsets. Multiple parameters associated with activation conditions are involved in generating this diversity that is associated with heterogeneous molecular contents of activated cells. Naive cell polarisation upon antigenic stimulation and the asymmetric division that results are known to be a major source of heterogeneity and cell fate regulation. The consequences of stochastic uneven partitioning of molecular content upon subsequent divisions remain unclear. Here we aim at studying the impact of uneven partitioning on molecular-content heterogeneity and then on the immune response dynamics at the cellular level. To do so, we introduce a multiscale mathematical model of the CD8 T-cell immune response in the lymph node. In the model, cells are described as agents evolving and interacting in a 2D environment while a set of differential equations, embedded in each cell, models the regulation of intra and extracellular proteins involved in cell differentiation. Based on the analysis of in silico data at the single cell level, we show that immune response dynamics can be explained by the molecular-content heterogeneity generated by uneven partitioning at cell division. In particular, uneven partitioning acts as a regulator of cell differentiation and induces the emergence of two coexisting subpopulations of cells exhibiting antagonistic fates. We show that the degree of unevenness of molecular partitioning, along all cell divisions, affects the outcome of the immune response and can promote the generation of memory cells.",

    "abstract": "GsrN is a conserved small RNA that is under transcriptional control of the general stress sigma factor, {sigma}T, and that functions as a post-transcriptional regulator of Caulobacter crescentus survival under multiple stress conditions. We have defined features of GsrN structure that determine survival under hyperosmotic stress, and have applied transcriptomic and proteomic methods to identify regulatory targets of GsrN under hyperosmotic conditions. The 5 end of GsrN, which includes a conserved cytosine-rich stem loop structure, is necessary for cell survival after osmotic upshock. GsrN both activates and represses gene expression in this stress condition. Expression of an uncharacterized open reading frame predicted to encode a glycine-zipper protein, osrP, is strongly activated by GsrN. Our data support a model in which GsrN physically interacts with osrP mRNA through its 5 C-rich stem loop to enhance OsrP protein expression. We conclude that sigT, gsrN, and osrP form a coherent feedforward loop in which {sigma}T activates gsrN and osrP transcription during stress, and GsrN activates OsrP protein expression at the post-transcriptional level. This study delineates transcriptional and post-transcriptional layers of Caulobacter gene expression control during hyperosmotic stress, uncovers a new regulatory target of GsrN, and defines a coherent feedforward motif in the Caulobacter GSR regulatory network.\\n\\nImportanceBacteria inhabit diverse niches, and must adapt their physiology to constant environmental fluctuations. A major response to environmental perturbation is to change gene expression. Caulobacter and other alphaproteobacteria initiate a complex gene expression program known as the general stress response (GSR) under conditions including oxidative stress, osmotic stress, and nutrient limitation. The GSR enables cell survival in these environments. Understanding how bacteria survive stress requires that we dissect gene expression responses, such as the GSR, at the molecular level. This study is significant as it defines transcriptional and post-transcriptional layers of gene expression regulation in response to hyperosmotic stress. We further provide evidence that coherent feedforward motifs influence the system properties of the Caulobacter GSR pathway.",

This difference might indicate sex specific alterations of brain networks involved in autism symptom domains, especially within cortico-striatal and sensory integration networks. This study used a well-controlled twin design to examine sex differences in brain anatomy in relation to repetitive behaviors. In 75 twin pairs (n=150, 62 females, 88 males) enriched for autism spectrum disorder (n=32), and other neurodevelopmental disorders (n =32), we explored the association of restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests - operationalized by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (C domain) and the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behavior subscale), with cortical volume, surface area and thickness of neocortical, sub-cortical and cerebellar networks. Cotwin control analyses revealed within-pair associations between RRBI symptoms and the right intraparietal sulcus and right orbital gyrus in females only. These findings endorse the importance of investigating sex differences in the neurobiology of autism symptoms, and indicate different etiological pathways underlying restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests in females and males.",

    "abstract": "Specific temporal phase relation of serotonergic and dopaminergic oscillations alters reproductive responses in many species. Aim of the study was to confirm whether effect of serotonergic drug (5-HTP) and dopaminergic drug (L-DOPA) is due to their conversion into serotonin and dopamine respectively or other products. For this study, PCPA (p-chlorophenylalanine, a long lasting inhibitor of serotonin synthesis), DDC (Diethyldithiocarbamate, which inhibits biosynthesis of nor-adrenaline), -MT (Methyl-p-tyrosine, an inhibitor for the conversion of tyrosine to DOPA) and DOPS (Dihydroxyphenylserine, a specific precursor for noradrenaline) were used in different groups in addition to 5-HTP and L-DOPA given at specific time interval. Reproductive responses monitored at 10 weeks post treatment indicate that gonadal activity was significantly low in HTP:DOPA (8-hr quail), HTP+PCPA:DOPA and HTP:DOPA+DDC quail compare to control (S:S). However, gonadal activity of HTP:S(HTP control), S:DOPA(DOPA control) and HTP: -MT+DOPS was not different from S:S control and remained in active condition. These findings indicate that it is not the dose of neurotransmitter precursor drugs (5-HTP and L-DOPA) and the neurotransmitters (serotonin and dopamine itself) that cause the effect, instead it is the function of interval between the drug administration which induces or entrains specific phase relation between serotonergic and dopaminergic oscillations. Further, gonadal suppression observed in HTP:DOPA, HTP+PCPA:DOPA and HTP:DOPA+DDC group three groups is not due to injection of 5-HTP or L-DOPA (alone) but due to conversion of administered 5-HTP into serotonin and conversion of L-DOPA (administered) into dopamine; not due to their further conversion into catecholamines other than dopamine i.e. noradrenaline or adrenaline.",

Quarantine efforts are particularly likely to be undervalued in circumstances where a failure incurs non-economic costs.

    "abstract": "While clines in environmental tolerance and phenotypic plasticity along a single species range are widespread and of special interest in the context of adaptation to environmental changes, we know little about their evolution. Recent empirical findings in ectotherms suggest that processes underlying dynamic species ranges can give rise to spatial differences in environmental tolerance and phenotypic plasticity within species. We used individual-based simulations to investigate how plasticity and tolerance evolve in the course of three scenarios of species range shifts and range expansions on environmental gradients. We found that regions of a species range which experienced a longer history or larger extent of environmental change generally exhibited increased plasticity or tolerance. Such regions may be at the trailing edge when a species is tracking its ecological niche in space (e.g., in a climate change scenario) or at the front edge when a species expands into a new habitat (e.g., in an expansion/invasion scenario). Elevated tolerance and plasticity in the distribution center was detected when asymmetric environmental change (e.g., polar amplification) led to a range expansion. Greater gene flow across the range had a dual effect on plasticity and tolerance clines, with an amplifying effect in niche expansion scenarios (allowing for faster colonization into novel environments), but with a dampening effect in range shift scenarios (favoring spatial translocation of adapted genotypes). However, tolerance and plasticity clines were transient and slowly flattened out after range dynamics because of genetic assimilation. In general, our approach allowed us to investigate the evolution of environmental tolerance and phenotypic plasticity under transient evolutionary dynamics in non-equilibrium situations, which contributes to a better understanding of observed patterns and of how species may respond to future environmental changes.\\n\\nImpact SummaryIn a variable and changing environment, the ability of a species to cope with a range of selection pressures and a multitude of environmental conditions is critical, both for its spatial distribution and its long-term persistence. Striking examples of spatial differences in environmental tolerance have been found within species, when single populations differed from each other in their environmental optimum and tolerance breadth, a characteristic that might strongly modify a species response to future environmental change. However, we still know little about the evolutionary processes causing these tolerance differences between populations, especially when the differences result from transient evolutionary dynamics in non-equilibrium situations. We demonstrate with individual-based simulations, how spatial differences in environmental tolerance and phenotypic plasticity evolved across a species range during three scenarios of range shifts and range expansion. Range dynamics were either driven by environmental change or by the expansion of the ecological niche. The outcome strongly differed between scenarios as tolerance and plasticity were maximized either at the leading edge, at the trailing edge, or in the middle of the species range. Spatial tolerance variation resulted from colonization chronologies and histories of environmental change that varied along the range. Subsequent to the range dynamics, the tolerance and plasticity clines slowly leveled out again as result of genetic assimilation such that the described responses are long-lasting, but in the end temporary. These findings help us better understand species evolutionary responses during range shifts and range expansion, especially when facing environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Lysobacter enzymogenes C3 is a predatory strain of gram-negative gliding bacteria that produces antifungal antibiotics by the polyketide synthetic pathway. Outer membrane vesicles (OMV) are formed as a stress response and can deliver virulence factors to host cells. The production of OMV by C3 and their role in antifungal activity are reported here. Vesicles in the range of 130-150 nm in diameter were discovered in the cell-free supernatants of C3 cultures. These OMV contain molecules characteristic of bacterial outer membranes, such as lipopolysaccharide and phospholipids. In addition, they contain chitinase activity and essentially all of the heat stable antifungal activity in cell supernatants. We show here that C3 OMV can directly inhibit growth of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as the filamentous fungus Fusarium subglutinans. The activity is dependent on physical contact between OMV and the cells. Furthermore, fluorescent lipid labeling of C3 OMV demonstrated transfer of the membrane-associated probe to yeast cells, suggesting the existence of a mechanism of delivery for membrane-associated molecules. Mass spectrometric analysis of C3 OMV extracts indicates the presence of molecules with molecular weights identical to some of the previously identified antifungal products of C3. These data together suggest that OMV act as an important remote mobile component of predation by Lysobacter.\\n\\nImportanceThe data presented here suggest a newly discovered function of outer membrane vesicles (OMV) that are produced from the outer membrane of the bacterial species Lysobacter enzymogenes C3. We show that these OMV can be released from the surface of the cells to deliver antibiotics to target fungal organisms as a mechanism of killing or growth inhibition. Understanding the role of OMV in antibiotic delivery can generally lead to improved strategies for dealing with antibiotic-resistant organisms. These results also add to the evidence that some bacterially produced antibiotics can be discovered and purified using methods designed for isolation of nanoscale vesicles. Information on these systems can lead to better identification of active molecules or design of delivery vehicles for these molecules.",

In this study we compared the performance of BKV qPCR analyte specific reagents (ASR) by ELITech, and Luminex for measuring BKV viral load in plasma and serum using the Roche Cobas(R) z480 instrument, and the Luminex ARIES(R) platform respectively. A total of 34 patients previously tested on the z480, with results spanning the test  s linear range, were analyzed on the ARIES(R). The BKV DNA copy number correlation between the two methods was very good with an R2 value of 0.98. The average difference in log copy number between the two methods was -0.3, indicating that the ARIES(R) method may have slightly greater analytical sensitivity. BKV quantification results were closely matched between the two different methods. The workflow with the ARIES(R) System is greatly simplified by elimination of DNA extraction and most hands-on steps. The high degree of automation allows samples to be tested as they arrive into the laboratory, resulting in enhanced patient care due to more rapid turnaround time for results back to the ordering physician.",

    "abstract": "Erwinia tracheiphila is the causal agent of bacterial wilt of cucurbits, an economically important phytopathogen affecting few cultivated Cucurbitaceae host plant species in temperate Eastern North America. However, essentially nothing is known about E. tracheiphila population structure or genetic diversity. To address this shortcoming, a representative collection of 88 E. tracheiphila isolates was gathered from throughout its geographic range, and their genomes were sequenced. Phylogenomic analysis revealed three genetic clusters with distinct hrpT3SS virulence gene repertoires, host plant association patterns, and geographic distributions. The low genetic variation within each cluster suggests a recent population bottleneck followed by population expansion. We showed that in the field and greenhouse, cucumber (Cucumis sativus), which was introduced to North America by early Spanish conquistadors, is the most susceptible host plant species, and the only species susceptible to isolates from all three lineages. The establishment of large agricultural populations of highly susceptible C. sativus in temperate Eastern North America may have facilitated the original emergence of E. tracheiphila into cucurbit agro-ecosystems, and this introduced plant species may now be acting as a highly susceptible reservoir host. Our findings have broad implications for agricultural sustainability by drawing attention to how worldwide crop plant movement, agricultural intensification and locally unique environments may affect the emergence, evolution, and epidemic persistence of virulent microbial pathogens.\\n\\nImportanceErwinia tracheiphila is a virulent phytopathogen that infects two genera of cucurbit crop plants, Cucurbita spp. (pumpkin and squash) and Cucumis spp. (muskmelon and cucumber). One of the unusual ecological traits of this pathogen is that it is limited to temperate Eastern North America. Here, we complete the first large-scale sequencing of an E. tracheiphila isolate collection. From phylogenomic, comparative genomic, and empirical analyses, we find that introduced Cucumis spp. crop plants are driving the diversification of E. tracheiphila into multiple, closely related lineages. Together, the results from this study show that locally unique biotic (plant population) and abiotic (climate) conditions can drive the evolutionary trajectories of locally endemic pathogens in unexpected ways.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression by targeting specific mRNAs; they are involved in the modulation of important mRNA networks involved in toxicity. Atrazine is a known endocrine-disrupting chemical, whose molecular mechanisms are unknown. In this study, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) gonads at two key developmental stages were exposed to 0.428 ppb atrazine for 24 h in vitro. MiRNA expression profiles were analysed to identify miRNAs related to gonad development and to reveal the atrazine mechanisms interfering with gonad differentiation. Atrazine exposure caused significant alteration of multiple miRNAs. Compared with the juvenile ovary, more miRNAs were down-regulated in juvenile testis, some of these down-regulated miRNAs target the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway related-genes. Predicted target genes of differently-expressed miRNAs after exposure to atrazine were involved in many reproductive biology signalling pathways. We suggest that these target genes may have important roles in atrazine-induced reproductive toxicity by altering miRNAs expression. Our results also indicate that atrazine can up-regulate aromatase expression through miRNAs, which supports the hypothesis that atrazine has endocrine-disrupting activity by altering the expression of genes of the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Gonad axis through its corresponding miRNAs. This study tells us the following conclusions: 1. Atrazine exposure results in significant alterations of miRNAs whose predicted target genes are associated with reproductive processes. 2. In the primordial gonad, atrazine promoted the expression of early gonad-determining genes by decreasing specific miRNAs. 3. In the juvenile gonad, atrazine promoted the biosynthesis of steroid hormones.",

    "abstract": "Malarial fever arises from the synchronous bursting of human red blood cells by the Plasmodium parasite. The released parasites re-infect neighboring red blood cells and undergo another asexual cycle of differentiation and proliferation for 48 hours, before again bursting synchronously. The synchrony of bursting is lost during in vitro culturing of the parasite outside the human body, presumably because the asexual cycle is no longer entrained by host-specific circadian cues. Therefore, most in vitro malaria studies have relied on the artificial synchronization of the parasite population. However, much remains unknown about the degree of timing heterogeneity of asexual cycles and how artificial synchronization may affect this timing. Here, we combined time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and long-term culturing to follow single cells and directly measure the heterogeneous timing of in vitro asexual cycles. We first demonstrate that unsynchronized laboratory cultures are not fully asynchronous and the parasites exhibit a bimodal distribution in their first burst times. We then show that synchronized and unsynchronized cultures had similar asexual cycle periods, which indicates that artificial synchronization does not fundamentally perturb asexual cycle dynamics. Last, we demonstrate that sibling parasites descended from the same schizont exhibited significant variation in asexual cycle period, although smaller than the variation between non-siblings. The additional variance between non-siblings likely arises from the variable environments and/or developmental programs experienced in different host cells.",

However, synaptic mechanisms by which IL-17 regulates pain transmission are unknown. Here we report that glia-produced IL-17 suppresses inhibitory synaptic transmission in spinal cord pain circuit and drives chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. We observed respective expression of IL-17 and its receptor IL-17R in spinal cord astrocytes and neurons. Patch clamp recording in spinal cord slices revealed that IL-17 not only enhanced EPSCs but also suppressed IPSCs and GABA-induced currents in lamina IIo somatostatin-expressing neurons. Spinal IL-17 was upregulated after paclitaxel treatment, and intrathecal IL-17R blockade reduced paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain. In dorsal root ganglia, respective IL-17 and IL-17R expression in satellite glial cells and neurons was sufficient and required for inducing neuronal hyperexcitability after paclitaxel. Together, our data show that IL-17/IL-17R mediate both central and peripheral neuron-glial interactions in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.",

Counts of the most common (major) variant, and all other variants (non-major variants) were determined from reads mapping to positions defining M. tuberculosis lineages. Expected variation was estimated during process development.\\n\\nResultsFor each sample we determined the non-major variant proportions at 55 sets of lineage defining positions. The non-major variant proportion in the two most mixed lineage defining sets (F2 metric) was compared with that in the 47 least mixed lineage defining sets (F47 metric). Three patterns were observed: (i) not mixed by either metric, (ii) high F47 metric suggesting mixtures of multiple lineages, and (iii) samples compatible with mixtures of two lineages, detected by differential F2 metric elevation relative to F47. Pattern (ii) was observed in batches, with similar patterns in the H37Rv control present in each run, and is likely to reflect cross-contamination. During production, the proportions of samples in each pattern were 97%, 2.8%, and 0.001%, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionThe F2 and F47 metrics described could be used for laboratory process control in laboratories sequencing M. tuberculosis.",

We examine the potential for using linkage disequilibrium to identify pairs of profiles as belonging to relatives when the query and database rely on nonoverlapping genetic markers. Considering data on individuals genotyped with both microsatellites used in forensic applications and genome-wide SNPs, we find that ~30-32% of parent-offspring pairs and ~35-36% of sib pairs can be identified from the SNPs of one member of the pair and the microsatellites of the other. The method suggests the possibility of performing familial searches of microsatellite databases using query SNP profiles, or vice versa. It also reveals that privacy concerns arising from computations across multiple databases that share no genetic markers in common entail risks not only for database entrants, but for their close relatives as well.",

    "abstract": "Stimuli of the environment, like objects, systematically activate the actions they are associated to. These activations occur extremely fast. Nevertheless, behavioural data reveal that, in most cases, these activations are then automatically inhibited, around 100 ms after the occurrence of the stimulus. We thus tested whether this early inhibition could be indexed by a central component of the N1 event-related brain potential (ERP). To achieve that goal, we looked at whether this ERP component is greater in tasks that could increase the inhibition and in trials where reaction times happen to be long. The illumination of a real space bar of a keyboard out of the dark was used as a stimulus. To maximize the modulation of the inhibition, the task participants had to performed was manipulated across blocks. A look-only task and a count task were used to increase inhibition and an immediate press task was used to decrease it. ERPs of the two block-conditions where presses had to be prevented and where the largest central N1s were predicted were compared to those elicited in the press task, differentiating the ERPs to the third of the trials where presses were the slowest from the ERPs to the third of the trials with the fastest presses. Despite larger negativities due to motor potentials and despite greater attention likely in immediate press-trials, central N1s were found to be minimal for the fastest presses, intermediate for the slowest ones and maximal for the two no-press conditions. These results thus provide a strong support for the idea that the central N1 indexes an early and short lasting automatic inhibition of the actions systematically activated by objects. They also confirm that the strength of this automatic inhibition spontaneously fluctuates across trials and tasks. On the other hand, just before N1s, parietal P1s were found greater for fastest presses. They might thus index the initial activation of these actions. Finally, consistent with the idea that N300s index late inhibition processes, that occur preferentially when the task requires them, these ERPs were quasi absent for fast presses trials and much larger in the three other conditions.\\n\\nHighlightsEvent-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by a real object\\n\\nSmaller parietal P1s and greater central N1s for slowest than for fastest motor responses\\n\\nEven greater central N1s for tasks without such responses\\n\\nCentral N1s may index early inhibition of stimulus-activated actions\\n\\nN300s could index late inhibition of stimulus-activated actions",

Here, we describe development of the protein-sol web server, which was previously restricted to protein solubility prediction from amino acid sequence. Tools are presented for calculating and mapping patches of hydrophobicity and charge on the protein surface. In addition, predictions of folded state stability and net charge are displayed as a heatmap for a range of pH and ionic strength conditions. Tools are evaluated in the context of antibodies, their fragments and interactions. Surprisingly, antibody-antigen interfaces are, on average, at least as polar as Fab surfaces. This benchmarking process provides the user with thresholds with which to assess non-polar surface patches, and possible solubility implications, in proteins of interest. Stability heatmaps compare favourably with experimental data for CH2 and CH3 domains. Display and quantification of surface polarity and pH / ionic strength dependence will be useful generally for investigation of protein biophysics.",

The aggressive biology of the disease is responsible for such dismal outcome and is manifested by an increase in self-renewal capacity of the cancer cells, which leads to an increased rate of tumor-recurrence, contributing to poor prognosis. Transcription factor SOX2 maintains a critical balance between differentiation and \\\"stemness\\\" and is thus tightly regulated within a cell. In cancer, SOX2 is aberrantly \\\"turned-on\\\" leading to activation of self-renewal pathways in cancer. Regulation of Sox2 in cancer is poorly understood. In the current study, we show for the first time that in pancreatic cancer, Sox2 is modified by addition of O-GlcNAc moiety, catalyzed by OGT (O-GlcNAc Transferase) at S246. This activates Sox2 transcriptional activity by stabilizing the protein in the nucleus. A CRISPR-OGT knockout in pancreatic cancer cell line S2VP10 resulted in a delayed tumor initiation. We further showed that mutation of this site (S246A) prevents the modification of Sox2 and its downstream activity. Our study also demonstrated that targeting OGT in vivo with a small molecule inhibitor OSMI, results in decreased tumor burden, delayed tumor progression and a decreased expression of SOX2 in pancreatic cancer cells. Our study highlights for the first time that that the O-GlcNAc transferase dependent SOX2 glycosylation has a profound effect on the transcriptional activity of SOX2 and is instrumental in determining self-renewal in pancreatic cancer.\\n\\nSignificanceOur study highlights for the first time that that the O-GlcNAc transferase dependent SOX2 glycosylation determines self-renewal in pancreatic cancer which is responsible for tumor initiation.",

    "abstract": "In contrast with autosomes, lineages of sex chromosomes reside for different amounts of time in males and females, and this transmission asymmetry makes them hotspots for sexual conflict. Similarly, the maternal inheritance of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) means that mutations that are beneficial in females can spread in a population even if they are deleterious in males, a form of sexual conflict known as Mothers Curse. While both Mothers Curse and sex chromosome induced sexual conflict have been well studied on their own, the interaction between mitochondrial genes and genes on sex chromosomes is poorly understood. Here, we use analytical models and computer simulations to perform a comprehensive examination of how transmission asymmetries of nuclear, mitochondrial, and sex chromosome-linked genes may both cause and resolve sexual conflicts. For example, the accumulation of male-biased Mothers Curse mtDNA mutations will lead to selection in males for compensatory nuclear modifier loci that alleviate the effect. We show how the Y chromosome, being strictly paternally transmitted provides a particularly safe harbor for such modifiers. This analytical framework also allows us to discover a novel kind of sexual conflict, by which Y chromosome-autosome epistasis may result in the spread of male beneficial but female deleterious mutations in a population. We christen this phenomenon Fathers Curse. Extending this analytical framework to ZW sex chromosome systems, where males are the heterogametic sex, we also show how W-autosome epistasis can lead to a novel kind of nuclear Mothers Curse. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive framework to understand how genetic transmission asymmetries may both cause and resolve sexual conflicts.",

The long reads were used to find structural variants in each isolate to examine heterozygosity.

    "abstract": "Host-associated bacteria can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on host health. While some of the molecular mechanisms that determine these outcomes are known, little is known about the evolutionary histories of pathogenic or mutualistic lifestyles. Using the model plant Arabidopsis, we found that closely related strains within the Pseudomonas fluorescens species complex promote plant growth and occasionally cause disease. To elucidate the genetic basis of the transition between commensalism and pathogenesis, we developed a computational pipeline and identified genomic islands that correlate with outcomes for plant health. One island containing genes for lipopeptide biosynthesis and quorum sensing is required for pathogenesis. Conservation of the quorum sensing machinery in this island allows pathogenic strains to eavesdrop on quorum signals in the environment and coordinate pathogenic behavior. We found that genomic loci associated with both pathogenic and commensal lifestyles were convergently gained and lost in multiple lineages through homologous recombination, possibly constituting an early step in the differentiation of pathogenic and commensal lifestyles. Collectively this work provides novel insights into the evolution of commensal and pathogenic lifestyles within a single clade of host-associated bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Aedes aegypti have a wide variety of sensory pathways that have supported success as a species as well as a highly competent vector of numerous debilitating infectious pathogens. Investigations into mosquito sensory systems and their effects on behavior are valuable resources for the advancement of mosquito control strategies. Numerous studies have elucidated key aspects of mosquito sensory systems, however there remains critical gaps within the field. In particular, compared to that of the adult form, there has been a lack of studies directed towards the immature life stages. Additionally, although numerous studies have pinpointed specific sensory receptors as well as relevant response behaviors, there has been a lack of studies able to monitor both concurrently. To begin filling aforementioned gaps, here we engineered Ae. aegypti to ubiquitously express a genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6s. Using this strain, combined with advanced confocal microscopy, we were able to simultaneously measure live stimulus-evoked calcium responses in both neuronal and muscle cells with a wide spatial range and resolution. Moreover, by coupling in vivo calcium imaging with behavioral assays we were able to gain functional insights into how stimulus-evoked neural and muscle activities are represented, modulated, and transformed in mosquito larvae enabling us to elucidate mosquito sensorimotor properties important for life-history-specific foraging strategies.\\n\\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding mosquito sensory systems and resulting behavior has been a major factor in the advancement of mosquito control innovations. Aedes aegypti larvae offer an effective life stage for further elucidating information on mosquito sensory systems. Due to their relatively simplified nervous system, mosquito larvae are ideal for studying neural signal transduction, coding, and behavior. Moreover, a better understanding of the larval sensory system may enable the development of novel control methodologies able to target mosquitoes before they reach a vector-competent stage. Here we engineer Ae. aegypti to ubiquitously express a genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6s and use this tool to observe links between sensorimotor responses and behavior by exploiting live calcium imaging as well as live tracking based behavioral assays.",

    "abstract": "The macaque visual system has long been used as a model for investigating the processing of incoming visual stimuli results from the coordinated work of a distributed network of areas interacting at many different levels (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991). While much is known about the organization and layout of the occipital visual areas, there are still substantial gaps in our understanding of layout and organization of the higher-level areas. The goal of this study is to describe the whole brain functional anatomy using BOLD-fMRI in macaques performing a series of demanding visuospatial attention tasks. We wish to study the spatial specificity of visual responses in terms of contralateral preference, i.e. stronger responses to contralateral visual stimuli, as well as retinotopic organization both in terms of polar angle and eccentricity. We found that most visuospatial processing areas only respond to contralaterally presented stimuli; ipsilaterally presented stimuli evoked little or no activity in these areas. Additionally, we found that LIP, MT, and possibly PITd contained polar-angle maps of the contralateral hemifield. These same areas, plus FEF and area 46, appear to have separate representations of the fovea and periphery. When compared to previous human fMRI studies, these results indicate that there may be significant differences between macaque visual processing areas and their putative human homologues.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe number of glomeruli and glomerulosclerosis evaluated on kidney biopsy slides constitute as standard components of a renal pathology report. Prevailing methods for glomerular assessment remain manual, labor intensive and non-standardized. We developed a deep learning framework to accurately identify and segment glomeruli from digitized images of human kidney biopsies.\n\nMethodsTrichrome-stained images (n=275) from renal biopsies of 171 chronic kidney disease patients treated at the Boston Medical Center from 2009-12 were analyzed. A sliding window operation was defined to crop each original image to smaller images. Each cropped image was then evaluated by three experts into three categories: (a) No glomerulus, (b) Normal or partially sclerosed glomerulus and (c) Globally sclerosed glomerulus. This led to identification of 751 unique images representing non{-}glomerular regions, 611 images with either normal or partially sclerosed (NPS) glomeruli and 134 images with globally sclerosed (GS) glomeruli. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained with cropped images as inputs and corresponding labels as output. Using this model, an image processing routine was developed to scan the test data images to segment the GS glomeruli.\n\nResultsThe CNN model was able to accurately discriminate non-glomerular images from NPS and GS images (Performance on test data - Accuracy: 92.67{+/-}2.02% and Kappa: 0.8681{+/-}0.0392). The segmentation model that was based on the CNN multi-label classifier accurately marked the GS glomeruli on the test data (Matthews correlation coefficient = 0.628).\n\nConclusionThis work demonstrates the power of deep learning for assessing complex histologic structures from digitized human kidney biopsies.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of gene expression through binding of transcription factors (TFs) to cis-regulatory elements is highly complex in mammalian cells. Genome-wide measurement technologies provide new means to understand this regulation, and models of TF regulatory networks have been built with the goal of identifying critical factors. Here, we report a network model of transcriptional regulation between TFs constructed by integrating genomewide identification of active enhancers and regions of focal DNA accessibility. Network topology is confirmed by published TF ChIP-seq data. By considering multiple methods of TF prioritization following network construction, we identify master TFs in well-studied cell types, and these networks provide better prioritization than networks only considering promoter-proximal accessibility peaks. Comparisons between networks from similar cell types show stable connectivity of most TFs, while master regulator TFs show dramatic changes in connectivity and centrality. Applying this method to study chronic lymphocytic leukemia, we prioritized several network TFs amenable to pharmacological perturbation and show that compounds targeting these TFs show comparable efficacy in CLL cell lines to FDA-approved therapies. The construction of transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) models can predict the interactions between individual TFs and predict critical TFs for development or disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBioaugmentation is now a well-established approach for attenuating toxic groundwater and soil contaminants, particularly for chlorinated ethenes and ethanes. The KB-1 and WBC-2 consortia are cultures used for this purpose. These consortia contain organisms belonging to the Dehalococcoidia, including strains of Dehalococcoides mccartyi in KB-1 and of both D. mccartyi and Dehalogenimonas in WBC-2. These tiny anaerobic bacteria couple respiratory reductive dechlorination to growth and harbour multiple reductive dehalogenase genes (rdhA) in their genomes, the majority of which have yet to be characterized.\\n\\nResultsUsing a combination of Illumina mate-pair and paired-end sequencing we closed the genomes of eight new strains of Dehalococcoides mccartyi found in three related KB-1 sub-cultures that were enriched on trichloroethene (TCE), 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) and vinyl chloride (VC), bringing the total number of genomes available in NCBI to 24. A pangenome analysis was conducted on 24 Dehalococcoides genomes and five Dehalogenimonas genomes (2 in draft) currently available in NCBI. This Dehalococcoidia pangenome generated 2875 protein families comprising of 623 core, 2203 accessory, and 49 unique protein families. In Dehalococcoides mccartyi the complement of reductive dehalogenase genes varies by strain, but what was most surprising was how the majority of rdhA sequences actually exhibit a remarkable degree of synteny across all D. mccartyi genomes. Several homologous sequences are also shared with Dehalogenimonas genomes. Nucleotide and predicted protein sequences for all reductive dehalogenases were aligned to begin to decode the evolutionary history of reductive dehalogenases in the Dehalococcoidia.\\n\\nConclusionsThe conserved synteny of the rdhA genes observed across Dehalococcoides genomes indicates that the major differences between strain rdhA gene complement has resulted from gene loss rather than recombination. These rdhA have a long evolutionary history and trace their origin in the Dehalococcoidia prior to the speciation of Dehalococcoides and Dehalogenimonas. The only rdhA genes suspected to have been acquired by lateral gene transfer are protein-coding rdhA that have been identified to catalyze dehalogenation of industrial pollutants. Sequence analysis suggests that evolutionary pressures resulting in new rdhA genes involve adaptation of existing dehalogenases to new substrates, mobilization of rdhA between genomes or within a genome, and to a lesser degree manipulation of regulatory regions to alter expression.",

    "abstract": "Mutations affecting the spliceosomal protein U2AF1 are commonly found in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). We have generated mice that carry Cre-dependent \\\"knock-in\\\" alleles of U2af1(S34F), the murine version of the most common mutant allele of U2AF1 encountered in human cancers. Cre-mediated recombination in murine hematopoietic lineages caused changes in RNA splicing, as well as multilineage cytopenia, macrocytic anemia, decreased hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, low-grade dysplasias, and impaired transplantability, but without lifespan shortening or leukemia development. In an attempt to identify U2af1(S34F)-cooperating changes that promote leukemogenesis, we combined U2af1(S34F) with Runx1 deficiency in mice and further treated the mice with a mutagen, N-Ethyl-N-Nitrosourea (ENU). Overall, three of sixteen ENU-treated compound transgenic mice developed AML. However, AML did not arise in mice with other genotypes or without ENU treatment. Sequencing DNA from the three AMLs revealed somatic mutations homologous to those considered to be drivers of human AML, including predicted loss-or gain-of-function mutations in Tet2, Gata2, Idh1, and Ikzfl. However, the engineered U2af1(S34F) missense mutation reverted to wild type (WT) in two of the three AML cases, implying that U2af1(S34F) is dispensable, or even selected against, once leukemia is established.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSomatic mutations in four splicing factor genes (U2AF1, SRSF2, SF3B1, and ZRSR2) are found in MDS and MDS-related AML, blood cancers with few effective treatment options. However, the pathophysiological effects of these mutations remain poorly characterized, in part due to the paucity of disease-relevant models. Here, we report the establishment of mouse models to study the most common U2AF1 mutation, U2af1(S34F). Production of the mutant protein specifically in the murine hematopoietic compartment disrupts hematopoiesis in ways resembling human MDS. We further identified deletion of the Runx1 gene and other known oncogenic mutations as changes that might collaborate with U2af1(S34F) to give rise to frank AML in mice.",

Here we test the impact of interaction modifications, introduced under a range of distributional assumptions to artificial and empirical trophic networks, on the overall structure of interactions within communities. We show that local stability and reactivity is critically dependent on the inter-relationship between the trophic and non-trophic effects. Depending on their distribution, interaction modifications can generate significant additional structure to community interactions making analyses of the stability of ecological systems based solely on trophic networks unreliable.

Amot function in developing hippocampal neurons depends on interactions with Yap1, which is also indispensable for dendrite growth and arborization in vitro.

In addition, we found that the BOLD responses summed similarly, and that at an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 4.5 sec BOLD summation was nearly linear in both species. When comparing the ratio of the amplitude of the response to the second checkerboard at the 4.5 sec ISI with that of the single checkerboard between subjects in both species, the results from both monkey subjects fell within one standard deviation of the mean human results (human mean (n=12): .95 +/- .31 second/single response amplitude; monkey 1: 1.16; monkey 2: .86). At the shorter ISIs, both species demonstrated increased suppression of the BOLD response to the second checkerboard.

To characterize these differences in the heart, one needs to consider the effects of magnetization transfer (MT) and the T2 relaxation time in the most commonly used cardiac T1 mapping sequences (MOLLI, ShMOLLI and SASHA).\\n\\nMethodsSix explanted pig hearts were scanned weekly over a period of six weeks on a 3T system with the MOLLI, ShMOLLI, SASHA sequences and an inversion recovery sequence as reference. The T1 bias was computed as the difference between MOLLI, ShMOLLI, SASHA and the reference T1 values. We applied robust correlation statistics to assess the relationships between T1, T2 and MT. All data are publicly available at: http://neuropoly.pub/pigHeartsData.\\n\\nResultsA systematic T1 bias was present for all sequences, with MOLLI and ShMOLLI underestimating T1 and SASHA slightly overestimating T1 compared to the reference. The correlation of T1 bias with T2 was weak and insignificant. However, MT showed significant associations with T1 bias for all sequences. Our analysis is also available at: http://neuropoly.pub/pigHeartsInteractive.\\n\\nConclusionWe investigated cardiac T1 mapping sequences in a setting that allowed us to explore their accuracy and their dependence on T2 and MT effects. The T2 effects were not significant, and could not explain the T1 bias of MOLLI, ShMOLLI, SASHA with respect to the reference. On the other hand, the T1 biases exhibited a strong correlation with MT. We conclude that inaccuracies in cardiac T1 mapping are primarily due to magnetization transfer.",

    "abstract": "Gcn5 and sirtuins are highly conserved HAT and HDAC enzymes that were first characterised as regulators of gene expression. Although histone tails are important substrates of these enzymes, these proteins also target many non-histone substrates that participate in diverse biological processes. The mechanisms used by these enzymes to choose their non-histone substrates is unclear. In this work, we use a unique synthetic biology approach in S. cerevisiae to demonstrate that a shared target sequence can act as a determinant of substrate selection for Gcn5 and sirtuins. We also exploit this system to define specific subunits of the Gcn5-containing ADA complex as regulators of non-histone acetylations proteome-wide.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Introduction Materials and Methods Results Discussion References The visual expectation that an object will appear at a certain location or time may increase the accuracy and speed of its detection (Eriksen and Hoffman, 1974; Posner, 1980; Carrasco et al., 2000; Dosher and Z-L., 2000). The ability to use prior information to enhance the processing of visual stimuli at a specific location is critical for quickly sorting through the myriad of incoming stimuli and making decisions regarding future actions. This selection process, known as visual attention, appears to be fundamental to our ability to navigate and interact with the environment, and accordingly has been the focus of innumerable psychological and neurobiological studies (Pa ...",
