    "abstract": "We introduce the conditional Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS) for a genomic region linked to a focal mutation of known frequency. An exact expression for its expected value is provided for the neutral model without recombination. Its relation with the expected SFS for two sites, 2-SFS, is discussed. These spectra derive from the coalescent approach of Fu (1995) for finite samples, which is reviewed. Remarkably simple expressions are obtained for the linked SFS of a large population, which are also solutions of the multiallelic Kolmogorov equations. These formulae are the immediate extensions of the well known single site{theta} /f neutral SFS. Besides the general interest in these spectra, they relate to relevant biological cases, such as structural variants and introgressions. As an application, a recipe to adapt Tajimas D and other SFS-based neutrality tests to a non-recombining region containing a neutral marker is presented.",

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythmicity, the 24-hour cycle responsive to light and dark, is determined by periodic oscillations in gene transcription. This phenomenon has broad ramifications in physiologic function. Recent work has disclosed more cycles in gene transcription, and to the uncovering of these we apply a novel signal processing methodology known as the pencil method and compare it to conventional parametric, nonparametric, and statistical methods. Methods: In order to assess periodicity of gene expression over time, we analyzed a database derived from livers of mice entrained to a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle. We also analyzed artificially generated signals to identify differences between the pencil decomposition and other alternative methods.\\n\\nResultsThe pencil decomposition revealed hitherto-unsuspected oscillations in gene transcription with 12-hour periodicity. The pencil method was robust in detecting the 24-hour circadian cycle that was known to exist, as well as confirming the existence of shorter-period oscillations. A key consequence of this approach is that orthogonality of the different oscillatory components can be demonstrated. thus indicating a biological independence of these oscillations, that has been subsequently confirmed empirically by knocking out the gene responsible for the 24-hour clock.\\n\\nConclusionSystem identification techniques can be applied to biological systems and can uncover important characteristics that may elude visual inspection of the data. Significance: The pencil method provides new insights on the essence of gene expression and discloses a wide variety of oscillations in addition to the well-studied circadian pattern. This insight opens the door to the study of novel mechanisms by which oscillatory gene expression signals exert their regulatory effect on cells to influence human diseases.",

    "abstract": "Variability in neuronal responses to identical stimuli is frequently correlated across a population. Attention is thought to reduce these correlations by suppressing noisy inputs shared by the population. However, even with precise control of the visual stimulus, the subjects attentional state varies across trials. While these state fluctuations are bound to induce some degree of correlated variability, it is currently unknown how strong their effect is, as previous studies generally do not dissociate changes in attentional strength from changes in attentional state variability. We designed a novel paradigm that does so and find both a pronounced effect of attentional fluctuations on correlated variability at long timescales and attention-dependent reductions in correlations at short timescales. These effects predominate in layers 2/3, as expected from a feedback signal such as attention. Thus, significant portions of correlated variability can be attributed to fluctuations in internally generated signals, like attention, rather than noise.",

    "abstract": "We study how the arboreal turtle ant (Cephalotes goniodontus) solves a fundamental computing problem: maintaining a trail network and finding alternative paths to route around broken links in the network. Turtle ants form a routing backbone of foraging trails linking several nests and temporary food sources. This species travels only in the trees, so their foraging trails are constrained to lie on a natural graph formed by overlapping branches and vines in the tangled canopy. Links between branches, however, can be ephemeral, easily destroyed by wind, rain, or animal movements. Here we report a biologically feasible distributed algorithm, parameterized using field data, that can plausibly describe how turtle ants maintain the routing backbone and find alternative paths to circumvent broken links in the backbone. We validate the ability of this probabilistic algorithm to circumvent simulated breaks in synthetic and real-world networks, and we derive an analytic explanation for why certain features are crucial to improve the algorithms success. Our proposed algorithm uses fewer computational resources than common distributed graph search algorithms, and thus may be useful in other domains, such as for swarm computing or for coordinating molecular robots.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic (or human-caused) wildfire is an increasingly important driver of ecological change on Pacific islands including southeastern Polynesia, but fire ecology studies are almost completely absent for this region. Where observations do exist, they mostly represent descriptions of fire effects on plant communities before the introduction of invasive species in the modern era. Understanding the effects of wildfire in southeastern Polynesian island vegetation communities can elucidate which species may become problematic invasives with continued wildfire activity. We investigate the effects of wildfire on vegetation in three low-elevation sites (45-379 m) on the island of Moorea in the Society Islands, French Polynesia, which are already heavily impacted by past human land use and invasive exotic plants, but retain some native flora. In six study areas (3 burned and 3 unburned comparisons), we placed 30 transects across sites and collected species and abundance information at 390 points. We analyzed each local community of plants in three categories: natives, those introduced by Polynesians before European contact (1767 C.E.), and those introduced since European contact. Burned areas had the same or lower mean species richness than paired comparison sites. Although wildfire did not affect the proportions of native and introduced species, it may increase the abundance of introduced species on some sites. Non-metric multidimensional scaling indicates that (not recently modified) comparison plant communities are more distinct from one another than are those on burned sites. We discuss conservation concerns for particular native plants absent from burned sites, as well as invasive species (including Lantana camara and Paraserianthes falcataria) that may be promoted by fire in the Pacific.",

    "abstract": "Genomes contain millions of short (<100 codons) open reading frames (sORFs), which are usually dismissed during gene annotation. Nevertheless, peptides encoded by such sORFs can play important biological roles, and their impact on cellular processes has long been underestimated. Here, we analyzed approximately 70,000 transcribed sORFs in the model plant Physcomitrella patens (moss). Several distinct classes of sORFs that differ in terms of their position on transcripts and the level of evolutionary conservation are present in the moss genome. Over 5000 sORFs were conserved in at least one of ten plant species examined. Mass spectrometry analysis of proteomic and peptidomic datasets suggested that 584 sORFs located on distinct parts of mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are translated, including 73 conservative sORFs. Translational analysis of the sORFs and main ORFs at a single locus suggested the existence of genes that code for multiple proteins and peptides with tissue-specific expression. Alternative splicing is likely involved in the excision of translatable sORFs from such transcripts. We identified a group of sORFs homologous to known protein domains and suggested they function as small interfering peptides. Functional analysis of candidate lncRNA-encoded peptides showed it to be involved in regulating growth and differentiation in moss. The high evolutionary rate and wide translation of sORFs suggest that they may provide a reservoir of potentially active peptides and their importance as a raw material for gene evolution. Our results thus open new avenues for discovering novel, biologically active peptides in the plant kingdom.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic projections are hypothesized to stabilize neural signaling and neural representations, but how they shape regional information processing and large-scale network interactions remains unclear. Here we investigated effects of lowered dopamine levels on within-region temporal signal variability (measured by sample entropy) and between-region functional connectivity (measured by pairwise temporal correlations) in the healthy brain at rest. The acute phenylalanine and tyrosine depletion (APTD) method was used to decrease dopamine synthesis in 51 healthy participants who underwent resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) scanning. Functional connectivity and regional signal variability were estimated for each participant. Multivariate partial least squares (PLS) analysis was used to statistically assess changes in signal variability following APTD as compared to the balanced control treatment. The analysis captured a pattern of increased regional signal variability following dopamine depletion. Changes in hemodynamic signal variability were concomitant with changes in functional connectivity, such that nodes with greatest increase in signal variability following dopamine depletion also experienced greatest decrease in functional connectivity. Our results suggest that dopamine may act to stabilize neural signaling, particularly in networks related to motor function and orienting attention towards behaviorally-relevant stimuli. Moreover, dopaminedependent signal variability is critically associated with functional embedding of individual areas in large-scale networks.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic meiosis, generation of haploid gametes depends on the formation of inter-homolog crossovers, which enable the pairing, physical linkage, and eventual segregation of homologs in the meiosis I division. A class of conserved meiosis-specific proteins, collectively termed ZMMs, are required for formation and spatial control of crossovers throughout eukaryotes. Here, we show that three S. cerevisiae ZMM proteins - Zip2, Zip4, and Spo16 - interact with one another and form a DNA-binding complex critical for crossover formation and control. We determined the crystal structure of a Zip2:Spo16 subcomplex, revealing a heterodimer structurally related to the XPF:ERCC1 endonuclease complex. Zip2:Spo16 lacks an endonuclease active site, but binds specific DNA structures found in early meiotic recombination intermediates. Mutations in multiple DNA-binding surfaces on the Zip2:Spo16 complex severely compromise DNA binding, supporting a model in which the complexs central and HhH domains cooperate to bind DNA. Overall, our data support a model in which the Zip2:Zip4:Spo16 complex binds and stabilizes early meiotic recombination intermediates, then coordinates additional factors to promote crossover formation and license downstream events including synaptonemal complex assembly.",

Especially in the visual modality, an increasing number of studies show that prediction-related neural signals carry feature-specific information about the stimulus. This is less established in the auditory modality, in particular without bottom-up signals driving neural activity. We studied whether auditory predictions are sharply tuned to even carry tonotopic specific information. For this purpose, we conducted a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment in which participants passively listened to sound sequences that varied in their regularity (i.e. entropy). Sound presentations were temporally predictable (3 Hz rate), but were occasionally omitted. Training classifiers on the random (high entropy) sound sequence and applying them to all conditions in a time-generalized manner, allowed us to assess whether and how carrier frequency specific information in the MEG signal is modulated according to the entropy level. We show that especially in an ordered (most predictable) sensory context neural activity during the anticipatory and omission periods contains carrier-frequency specific information. Overall our results illustrate in the human auditory system that prediction-related neural activity can be tuned in a tonotopically specific manner.",

Deletion of Psd1, which is lethal in mice, compromises mitochondrial function. We hypothesize that this reflects inefficient import of non-mitochondrial PE into the IM. To test this, we re-wired PE metabolism in yeast by re-directing Psd1p to the outer mitochondrial membrane or the endomembrane system. Our biochemical and functional analyses identified the IMS as the greatest barrier for PE import and demonstrated that PE synthesis in the IM is critical for cytochrome bc1 complex (III) function. Importantly, mutations predicted to disrupt a conserved PE-binding site in the complex III subunit, Qcr7p, impaired complex III activity similar to PSD1 deletion. Collectively, these data demonstrate that PE made in the IM by Psd1p is critical to support the intrinsic functionality of complex III and establish one likely mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The WNT signaling network is comprised of multiple receptors that relay various input signals via distinct transduction pathways to execute multiple complex and context-specific output processes. Integrity of the WNT signaling network relies on proper specification between canonical and non-canonical pathways, which presents a regulatory challenge given that several signal transducing elements are shared between pathways. Here, we report that USP9X, a deubiquitylase, and WWP1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, interact physically to regulate a ubiquitin switch on DVL2, a WNT signaling protein. Our findings indicate that USP9X-mediated deubiquitylation of DVL2 is required for canonical WNT activation, while DVL2 ubiquitylation promotes its localization to actin-rich projections and increased cellular motility. We propose that a WWP1-USP9X axis regulates a ubiquitin switch on DVL2 that specifies its participation in either canonical WNT or WNT-PCP pathways. These findings have important implications for therapeutic targeting of USP9X in human cancer.",

    "abstract": "Adult plant resistance (APR) is an enigmatic phenomenon in which resistance genes are ineffective in protecting seedlings from disease but confer robust resistance at maturity. Maize has multiple cases in which genes confer APR to northern leaf spot, a lethal disease caused by Cochliobolus carbonum race 1 (CCR1). The first identified case of APR in maize is encoded by a hypomorphic allele, Hm1A, at the hm1 locus. In contrast, wild type alleles of hm1 provide complete protection at all developmental stages and in every part of the maize plant. Hm1 encodes an NADPH-dependent reductase, which inactivates HC-toxin, a key virulence effector of CCR1. Cloning and characterization of Hm1A ruled out differential transcription or translation for its APR phenotype and identified an amino acid substitution that reduced HC-toxin reductase (HCTR) activity. The possibility of a causal relationship between the weak nature of Hm1A and its APR phenotype was confirmed by the generation of two new APR alleles of Hm1 by mutagenesis. The HCTRs encoded by these new APR alleles had undergone relatively conservative missense changes that partially reduced their enzymatic activity similar to HM1A. No difference in accumulation of HCTR was observed between adult and juvenile plants, suggesting that the susceptibility of seedlings derives from a greater need for HCTR activity, not reduced accumulation of the gene product. Conditions and treatments that altered the photosynthetic output of the host had a dramatic effect on resistance imparted by the APR alleles, demonstrating a link between the energetic or metabolic status of the host and disease resistance affected by HC-toxin catabolism by the APR alleles of HCTR.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYAdult plant resistance (APR) is a phenomenon in which disease resistance genes are able to confer resistance at the adult stages of the plant but somehow fail to do so at the seedling stages. Despite the widespread occurrence of APR in various plant diseases, the mechanism underlying this trait remains obscure. It is not due to the differential transcription of these genes, and here we show that it is also not due to the differential translation or activity of the APR alleles of the maize hm1 gene at different stages of development. Using a combination of molecular genetics, biochemistry and physiology, we present multiple lines of evidence that demonstrate that APR is a feature or symptom of weak forms of resistance. While the mature parts of the plant are metabolically robust enough to manifest resistance, seedling tissues are not, leaving them vulnerable to disease. Growth conditions that compromise the photosynthetic output of the plant further deteriorate the ability of the seedlings to protect themselves from pathogens.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryCharacterization of adult plant resistance in the maize-CCR1 pathosystem reveals a causal link between weak resistance and APR.",

    "abstract": "With 302 neurons and a near complete reconstruction of the neural and muscle anatomy at the cellular level, C. elegans is an ideal candidate organism to study the neuromechanical basis of behavior. Yet, despite the breadth of knowledge about the neurobiology, anatomy and physics of C. elegans, there are still a number of unanswered questions about one of its most basic and fundamental behaviors: forward locomotion. How the rhythmic pattern is generated and propagated along the body is not yet well understood. We report on the development and analysis of a model of forward locomotion that integrates the neuroanatomy, neurophysiology and body mechanics of the worm. Our model is motivated by experimental analysis of the structure of the ventral cord circuitry and the effect of local body curvature on nearby motoneurons. We developed a neuroanatomically-grounded model of the head motoneuron circuit and the ventral nerve cord circuit. We integrated the neural model with an existing biomechanical model of the worm s body, with updated musculature and stretch receptors. Unknown parameters were evolved using an evolutionary algorithm to match the speed of the worm on agar. We performed 100 evolutionary runs and consistently found electrophysiological configurations that reproduced realistic control of forward movement. The ensemble of successful solutions reproduced key experimental observations that they were not designed to fit, including the wavelength and frequency of the propagating wave. Analysis of the ensemble revealed that head motoneurons SMD and RMD are sufficient to drive dorsoventral undulations in the head and neck and that short-range posteriorly-directed proprioceptive feedback is sufficient to propagate the wave along the rest of the body.",

    "abstract": "Hard decisions between equally valued alternatives can result in preference changes, meaning that subsequent valuations for chosen items increase and decrease for rejected items. Previous research suggests that this phenomenon is a consequence of cognitive dissonance reduction after the decision, induced by the mismatch between initial preferences and decision outcomes. In contrast, this functional magnetic resonance imaging and eye-tracking study tested whether preferences are already updated online while making decisions. Preference changes could be predicted from activity in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and precuneus during decision-making. Furthermore, fixation durations predicted both choice outcomes and subsequent preference changes. These preference adjustments became behaviourally relevant at re-evaluation, but only for choices that were remembered and were associated with hippocampus activity. Our findings refute classical explanations of post-choice dissonance reduction and instead suggest that preferences evolve dynamically as decisions arise, potentially as a mechanism to prevent stalemate situations in underdetermined decision scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of related neurodevelopmental diseases displaying significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity1-4. Despite recent progress in understanding ASD genetics, the nature of phenotypic heterogeneity across probands remains unclear5, 6. Notably, likely gene-disrupting (LGD) de novo mutations affecting the same gene often result in substantially different ASD phenotypes. Nevertheless, we find that truncating mutations that affect the same exon frequently lead to strikingly similar intellectual phenotypes in unrelated ASD probands. Analogous patterns are observed for two independent proband cohorts and several other important ASD-associated phenotypes. We find that exons biased towards prenatal and postnatal expression preferentially contribute to ASD cases with lower and higher IQ phenotypes, respectively. These results suggest that exons, rather than genes, often represent a unit of effective phenotypic impact for truncating mutations in autism. The observed phenotypic effects are likely mediated by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of splicing isoforms, with autism phenotypes usually triggered by relatively mild (15-30%) decreases in overall gene dosage. We find that each gene with recurrent ASD mutations can be described by a parameter, phenotype dosage sensitivity (PDS), which characterizes the quantitative relationship between changes in a genes dosage and changes in a given disease phenotype. We further demonstrate analogous relationships between LGD mutations and changes in gene expression across human tissues. Therefore, similar phenotypic patterns may be also observed in multiple other systems and genetic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic adaptation to changing environments is an essential goal of population and quantitative genetics. While technological advances now allow interrogation of genome-wide genotyping data in large panels, our understanding of the process of polygenic adaptation is still limited. To address this limitation, we use extensive forward-time simulation to explore the impacts of variation in demography, trait genetics, and selection on the rate and mode of adaptation and the resulting genetic architecture. We simulate a population adapting to an optimum shift, modeling sequence variation for 20 QTL for each of 12 different demographies for 100 different traits varying in the effect size distribution of new mutations, the strength of stabilizing selection, and the contribution of the genomic background. We then use random forest regression approaches to learn the relative importance of input parameters in determining a number of aspects of the process of adaptation including the speed of adaptation, the relative frequency of hard sweeps and sweeps from standing variation, or the final genetic architecture of the trait. We find that selective sweeps occur even for traits under relatively weak selection and where the genetic background explains most of the variation. Though most sweeps occur from variation segregating in the ancestral population, new mutations can be important for traits under strong stabilizing selection that undergo a large optimum shift. We also show that population bottlenecks and expansion impact overall genetic variation as well as the relative importance of sweeps from standing variation and the speed with which adaptation can occur. We then compare our results to two traits under selection during maize domestication, showing that our simulations qualitatively recapitulate differences between them. Overall, our results underscore the complex population genetics of individual loci in even relatively simple quantitative trait models, but provide a glimpse into the factors that drive this complexity and the potential of these approaches for understanding polygenic adaptation.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMany traits are controlled by a large number of genes, and environmental changes can lead to shifts in trait optima. How populations adapt to these shifts depends on a number of parameters including the genetic basis of the trait as well as population demography. We simulate a number of trait architectures and population histories to study the genetics of adaptation to distant trait optima. We find that selective sweeps occur even in traits under relatively weak selection and our machine learning analyses find that demography and the effect sizes of mutations have the largest influence on genetic variation after adaptation. Maize domestication is a well suited model for trait adaptation accompanied by demographic changes. We show how two example traits under a maize specific demography adapt to a distant optimum and demonstrate that polygenic adaptation is a well suited model for crop domestication even for traits with major effect loci.",

CK2 is a constitutively active, serine/threonine kinase in eukaryotes, having a wide array of known substrates and involved in many cellular processes. We investigated the localization and role of MoCK2 during growth and infection. BLAST search for MoCK2 components and targeted deletion of subunits was combined with protein-GFP fusions to investigate localization. We found one CKa and two CKb subunits of the CK2 holoenzyme. Deletion of the catalytic subunit CKa was not possible and might indicate that such deletions are lethal. The CKb subunits could be deleted but they were both necessary for normal growth and pathogenicity. Localization studies showed that the CK2 holoenzyme needed to be intact for normal localization at septal pores and at appressorium penetration pores. Nuclear localization of CKa was however not dependent on the intact CK2 holoenzyme. In appressoria, CK2 formed a large ring perpendicular to the penetration pore and the ring formation was dependent on the presence of all CK2 subunits. The effects on growth and pathogenicity of deletion of the b subunits combined with the localization indicate that CK2 can have important regulatory functions not only in the nucleus/nucleolus but also at fungal specific structures as septa and appressorial pores.",

    "abstract": "In embryology, analytical approaches such as segmentation are applied to acquiring quantitative criteria from time-series three-dimensional microscopic images. When used to segment cells or intracellular organelles, several current machine learning techniques outperform traditional image processing algorithms. However segmentation algorithms still have unsolved problems, especially in bioimage processing. The most critical issue is that the existing algorithms can perform only semantic segmentation, which distin-guishes whether a pixel is within an object (for example, nucleus) or not. In this study, we implemented a novel segmentation algorithm, based on deep learning, which segments each nucleus and adds different labels to the detected objects. This segmentation algorithm is called instance segmentation. Our instance segmentation algorithm, implemented as a neural network, which we named QCA Net, substantially out-performed 3D U-Net, which is the best semantic segmentation algorithm that uses deep learning. Using QCA Net, we quantified the nuclear number, volume, surface area, and center of gravity coordinates during the development of mouse embryos. In particular, QCA Net distinguished nuclei of embryonic cells from those of polar bodies formed in meiosis. We consider that QCA Net can greatly contribute to bioimage segmentation in embryology by generating quantitative criteria from segmented images.",

We show that the N-terminal 90 residues of the M45 protein, which contain a RIP Homotypic Interaction Motif (RHIM), are sufficient to confer protection against TNFR-induced necroptosis. This N-terminal region of M45 drives rapid self-assembly into homo-oligomeric amyloid fibrils and interacts with the RHIMs of human RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinases to form heteromeric amyloid fibrils in vitro. An intact RHIM core tetrad is required for the inhibition of cell death by M45 and we show that mutation of those key tetrad residues abolishes homo- and hetero-amyloid assembly by M45 in vitro, suggesting that the amyloidogenic nature of the M45 RHIM underlies its biological activity.

In ligand-receptor systems, the EC50 (concentration of the ligand that occupies 50% of the receptors) is higher before the system reaches steady-state. Based on this behavior, we have previously defined PRESS (for pre-equilibrium sensing and signaling), a general \\\"systems level\\\" mechanism cells may use to overcome input saturation. Originally, we showed that, given a step stimulation, PRESS operates when the kinetics of ligand-receptor binding are slower than the downstream signaling steps. Now, we show that, provided the input increases slowly, it is not essential for the ligand binding reaction itself to be slow. In addition, we demonstrate that covalent modification cycles and gene expression systems may also operate in PRESS mode. Thus, nearly all biochemical processes may operate in PRESS mode, suggesting that this mechanism may be ubiquitous in cell signaling systems.",

The variation in texture perception across populations is thought to depend on oral tactile sensitivity and oral processing behaviors. To address this hypothesis, we aimed to measure tactile acuity with a battery of tests and quantitate the relationship to oral processing. The study was performed on 98 participants, in 3 age groups (20-25, 35-45, or over 62). Two main measures of oral sensitivity were performed: to assess bite force, subjects were asked to discriminate between foam samples of varying hardness. Secondly, to assess lingual sensitivity the subjects were asked to identify 3D printed shapes, ranging from 3mm to 8mm, using their tongue, as well as identify confectionary letters. Additionally, chewing efficiency was measured through assessing each participants ability to mix two-colored chewing gum. In general, we found that sensitivity and chewing efficiency in the younger age groups was superior to that of older adults (p<0.0001). We also found a positive linear trend between bite force sensitivity and chewing efficiency with younger participants, a trend not found in older participants. We found no significant relationship between age groups for bite force and chewing efficiency, suggesting that age-related declines in bite force sensitivity are not a significant cause of altered oral processing ability. These results help bolster evidence that sensitivity and oral processing are related, as well previously reported declines in both as people age.",

We analysed the effect of tree diameter and living status (alive or dead) on microhabitat number and occurrence per tree, taking into account biogeoclimatic variables and tree genus.\n\nWe confirmed that larger trees and dead trees bore more microhabitats than their smaller or living counterparts did; we extended these results to a wider range of tree genera and ecological conditions. Contrary to expectations, the total number of microhabitat types per tree barely varied with tree genus - though we did find slightly higher accumulation levels for broadleaves than for conifers - nor did it vary with elevation or soil pH. We observed the same results for the occurrence of individual microhabitat types. However, accumulation levels with diameter and occurrence on dead trees were higher for microhabitats linked with wood decay processes (e.g. dead branches or woodpecker feeding holes) than for other, epixylic, microhabitats such as epiphytes (ivy, mosses and lichens).\n\nPromoting large living and dead trees of several tree species may be an interesting, and nearly universal, way to favour microhabitats and enhance the substrates needed to support specific biodiversity. In addition, a better understanding of microhabitat drivers and dynamics at the tree scale may help to better define their role as biodiversity indicators for large-scale monitoring.",

    "abstract": "The recent discovery that myosin has two distinct states in relaxed muscle - disordered relaxed (DRX) and super-relaxed (SRX) - provides another factor to consider in our fundamental understanding of the aging mechanism in skeletal muscle, since myosin is thought to be a potential contributor to dynapenia. The primary goal of this study was to determine the effects of age on DRX and SRX states and to examine their sex specificity. We have used quantitative fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent nucleotide analog 2'/3'-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) ATP (mantATP) to measure single-nucleotide turnover kinetics of myosin in skinned skeletal muscle fibers under relaxing conditions. We examined changes in DRX and SRX in response to the natural aging process by measuring the turnover of mantATP in skinned fibers isolated from psoas muscle of adult young (3-4 months old) and aged (26-28 months old) C57BL/6 female and male mice. Fluorescence decays were fitted to a multi-exponential decay function to determine both the time constants and mole fractions of fast and slow turnover populations, and significance was analyzed by a t-test. We found that in females, both the DRX and SRX lifetimes of myosin ATP turnover at steady state were shorter in aged muscle fibers compared to young muscle fibers (p[&le;]0.033). However, there was no significant difference in relaxation lifetime of either DRX (p=0.202) or SRX (p=0.804) between young and aged male mice. No significant effects were measured on the mole fractions (populations) of these states, as a function of sex or age (females, p=0.100; males, p=0.929). The effect of age on the order of myosin heads at rest and their ATPase function is sex specific, affecting only females. These findings provide new insight into the molecular factors and mechanisms that contribute to aging muscle dysfunction in a sex-specific manner.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is characterized by increased output of inflammatory compounds from adipose tissue. Whilst the relative contribution of adipocytes and resident macrophages to this phenomenon is debated, there is no doubt that the secretions of each cell type can stimulate the expression of inflammatory genes in the other. We hypothesized that mechanisms must exist to prevent an escalating positive feedback loop between the two cell types, so that after an initial exposure to macrophage secretions, adipocytes would become desensitized to subsequent inflammatory stimulation.\\n\\nWe used microarrays to investigate the response of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to macrophage secretions (macrophage conditioned medium, MCM). MCM caused a rapid (<4 hours) and high amplitude (over 100-fold) rise in the expression of several inflammatory genes. For some genes, generally cytokines, expression returned to basal levels within 24 h following removal of the MCM, but other transcripts, notably those for acute phase proteins and extracellular matrix remodeling proteins, remained highly expressed even during the washout period.\\n\\nUnexpectedly, some cytokine genes (e.g., iNOS, IL-6) showed an enhanced expression to a second exposure of MCM, illustrating that the transcriptome response of 3T3-L1 adipocytes retains a memory to the first stimulus. We characterized the parameters that give rise to the memory phenomenon, finding that additional stimuli do not augment or abrogate the effect. The memory is preserved for several days after the initial exposure and it is not due to a change in sensitivity to the MCM but, rather, a change in the capacity of the signal-target system. The possible mechanisms of the memory are discussed, along with the physiological ramifications should the phenomenon be replicated in vivo.",

Since womens readiness for dietary behavioral change can be one of the most effective fundamental measures for preventing chronic diseases in developing countries, the present study is aimed to determine the readiness for behavioral change in voluntary salt intake as well as its determinants among women living in Tehran.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsThe present cross-sectional study was conducted on 561 women referring to the women care units across city of Tehran. In this regard, demographic information of the participants was collected. The self-administered questionnaire included assessment of nutrition-related knowledge on salt intake and its association with diseases, discretionary salt intake, stages of change, and self-efficacy of women. In addition, the logistic regression test was used to determine the predictors of womens readiness for behavioral change in voluntary salt intake.\\n\\nResults40% women had someone in the family who had such a limitation (salt intake-limited exposure group), while 81.6% always or often added salt to their foods. Moreover, one-third of the participants were in the stage of pre-contemplation and 41.2% were in the stage of preparation for reducing salt intake. Stage of change increased with an increase in the self-efficacy score (r=0.42, p<0.001). Self-efficacy and salt intake-limited exposure were the two most important determinants of the womens readiness for behavioral change in voluntary salt intake, respectively: (OR=1.1 95% CI: 1.06-1.14 p<0.001; OR=1.58, 95% CI: 1.03-2.42 p<0.038)\\n\\nConclusionsResults of the present study showed that increased self-efficacy is associated with higher levels of behavioral change among women. Since self-efficacy is very important for initiating and maintaining the behavioral change, womens empowerment for reducing salt intake necessitates putting the emphasis on increased self-efficacy as well as community-based nutritional interventions.",

    "abstract": "Increased technological methods have enabled the investigation of biology at nanoscale levels. Nevertheless, such systems necessitate the use of computational methods to comprehend the complex interactions occurring. Traditionally, dynamics of metabolic systems are described by ordinary differential equations producing a deterministic result which neglects the intrinsic heterogeneity of biological systems. More recently, stochastic modeling approaches have gained popularity with the capacity to provide more realistic outcomes. Yet, solving stochastic algorithms tend to be computationally intensive processes. Employing the queueing theory, an approach commonly used to evaluate telecommunication networks, reduces the computational power required to generate simulated results, while simultaneously reducing expansion of errors inherent to classical deterministic approaches. Herein, we present the application of queueing theory to efficiently simulate stochastic metabolic networks. For the current model, we utilize glycolysis to demonstrate the power of the proposed modeling methods, and we describe simulation and pharmacological inhibition in glycolysis to further exemplify modeling capabilities.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryComputational biology is increasingly used to understand biological occurances and complex dynamics. Biological modeling, in general, aims to represent a biological system with computational approaches, as realistically and accurate as current methods allow. Metabolomics and metabolic systems have emerged as an important aspect of cellular biology, allowing a more sentive view for understanding the complex interactions occurring intracellularly as a result of normal or perturbed (or diseased) states. To understand metabolic changes, many researchers have commonly used Ordianary Differential Equations to produce in silico models of the in vitro system of interest. While these have been beneficial to date, continuing to advance computational methods of analyzing such systems is of interest. Stochastic models that include randomness have been known to produce more reaslistic results, yet the difficulty and intesive time component urges additional methods and techniques to be developed. In the present research, we propose using queueing networks as a technique to model complex metabolic systems, doing such with a model of glycolysis, a core metabolic pathway.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a freshwater fish that is cultured throughout the world. C. carpio belongs to the family Cyprinidae, the largest family among freshwater teleosts, accounting for 10 % of total fish production. Specifically, the common carp is cultured in more than 100 countries in worldwide and accounts for over 3 million metric tons of total annual freshwater fish production. The population of common carp (C. carpio) is declining in freshwater reservoirs because of various human activities, such as overfishing, pollution, hybridization with domestic carp, and loss of breeding grounds because of habitat degradation.\\n\\nResultsIn total, 30 specimens were collected from each of four different locations (WH1, WH2, WH3 and WH4) in the reservoir. Five random decamer primers were used to assay polymorphisms within and between the population of C. carpio. A total of 60 bands were produced by these primers, out of which 50 bands were polymorphic and 10 bands were monomorphic. The mean highest polymorphism (100 %) was observed in the specimen collected from WHS4 stock, followed by 89.05, 87.62 and 76.66 % of the fish collection from WH3, WH2, and WH4, respectively. Neis genetic distance values ranged from 0.0006 to 0.1005. Highest and lowest genetic distance were 0.1005 and 0.006 in fish collected from WH1 and WH2, respectively. Average value of heterozygosity ranged from 0.3008 to 0.3748. A C. carpio UPGMA dendrogram was constructed to observe fish phylogeny. Phylogenetic clusters by RAPD indicated that fish stock of WH2, WH3, and WH4 were closely related to each other.\\n\\nConclusionIt was concluded that RAPD analysis can be successfully used as a marker to generate information regarding the percent homology within stock of common carp, which may be used to trace the progeny to the parents and is helpful for the improvement of breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "The ability to track animals accurately is critical for behavioral experiments. For video-based assays, this is often accomplished by manipulating environmental conditions to increase contrast between the animal and the background, in order to achieve proper foreground/background detection (segmentation). However, as behavioral paradigms become more sophisticated with ethologically relevant environments, the approach of modifying environmental conditions offers diminishing returns, particularly for scalable experiments. Currently, there is a need for methods to monitor behaviors over long periods of time, under dynamic environmental conditions, and in animals that are genetically and behaviorally heterogeneous. To address this need, we developed a state-of-the-art neural network-based tracker for mice, using modern machine vision techniques. We test three different neural network architectures to determine their performance on genetically diverse mice under varying environmental conditions. We find that an encoder-decoder segmentation neural network achieves high accuracy and speed with minimal training data. Furthermore, we provide a labeling interface, labeled training data, tuned hyperparameters, and a pre-trained network for the mouse behavior and neuroscience communities. This general-purpose neural network tracker can be easily extended to other experimental paradigms and even to other animals, through transfer learning, thus providing a robust, generalizable solution for biobehavioral research.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have proposed deep learning techniques, namely recurrent neural networks, to improve biomedical text mining tasks. However, these techniques rarely take advantage of existing domain-specific resources, such as ontologies. In Life and Health Sciences there is a vast and valuable set of such resources publicly available, which are continuously being updated. Biomedical ontologies are nowadays a mainstream approach to formalize existing knowledge about entities, such as genes, chemicals, phenotypes, and disorders. These resources contain supplementary information that may not be yet encoded in training data, particularly in domains with limited labeled data.\\n\\nWe propose a new model, BO-LSTM, that takes advantage of domain-specific ontologies, by representing each entity as the sequence of its ancestors in the ontology. We implemented BO-LSTM as a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory units and using an open biomedical ontology, which in our case-study was Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI). We assessed the performance of BO-LSTM on detecting and classifying drug-drug interactions in a publicly available corpus from an international challenge, composed of 792 drug descriptions and 233 scientific abstracts. By using the domain-specific ontology in addition to word embeddings and WordNet, BO-LSTM improved both the F1-score of the detection and classification of drug-drug interactions, particularly in a document set with a limited number of annotations. Our findings demonstrate that besides the high performance of current deep learning techniques, domain-specific ontologies can still be useful to mitigate the lack of labeled data.\\n\\nAuthor summaryA high quantity of biomedical information is only available in documents such as scientific articles and patents. Due to the rate at which new documents are produced, we need automatic methods to extract useful information from them. Text mining is a subfield of information retrieval which aims at extracting relevant information from text. Scientific literature is a challenge to text mining because of the complexity and specificity of the topics approached. In recent years, deep learning has obtained promising results in various text mining tasks by exploring large datasets. On the other hand, ontologies provide a detailed and sound representation of a domain and have been developed to diverse biomedical domains. We propose a model that combines deep learning algorithms with biomedical ontologies to identify relations between concepts in text. We demonstrate the potential of this model to extract drug-drug interactions from abstracts and drug descriptions. This model can be applied to other biomedical domains using an annotated corpus of documents and an ontology related to that domain to train a new classifier.",

    "abstract": "NGS is a revolutionising diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. However, its relatively modest application in common diseases is limited by analytical approaches.\\n\\nInstead of variant-level approaches, typical for rare disease or large cohort analyses, contemporary investigation of common polygenic disorders requires the development of tools combining mutational burden and biological impact of a personalised set of mutations into single gene scores. GenePy (https://github.com/UoS-HGIG/GenePy) is a gene score for transforming sequencing data capable of estimating whole-gene pathogenicity on a per-patient basis.\\n\\nGenePy implements known deleteriousness metrics, incorporates allele frequency and individual zygosity information. Individuals harbouring multiple rare highly deleterious mutations accumulate extreme gene scores while the majority of genes usually achieve very low scores. Following correction for gene length, GenePy intuitively prioritises genes within individuals and affords gene/pathway score comparison between groups of individuals. Herein, we generate GenePy scores from whole-exome sequencing data for [~]15,000 genes across a cohort of 508 individuals. We describe score attributes and model behaviour under various biological conditions.\\n\\nWe demonstrate proof of concept that GenePy sensitively identifies known causal genes by calculating GenePy scores for NOD2 (an established causal Crohns Disease gene), in a modest cohort of patients for comparison against controls. This test of GenePy using a positive control gene demonstrates markedly more significant results (p=1.37 x 10-4) compared to the most commonly applied tool for combining common and rare variation.\\n\\nIn addition to increasing the biological information content for each variant, the per gene-per individual nature of GenePy transforms the utility of sequencing data. GenePy scores are intuitive when assessing for individual patients or for comparing between groups. Because GenePy intrinsically reflects pathogenicity at the gene level, this specifically facilitates downstream data integration (e.g. into machine learning, network and topological analyses) with transcriptomic and proteomic data that also report at the gene level.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryRapid technological advances have made DNA sequencing an effective, economic tool for detecting genomic variation. Detecting rare variation at the individual level is proving very successful in identifying the genetic causes of disease when just single mutations are sufficient to manifest disease. However, interpreting genomic data is much less straightforward for common diseases such as asthma, arthritis or heart disease where many genetic changes across multiple genes combine with the environment to bring about disease symptoms.\\n\\nWe have developed a new scoring system called GenePy that generates whole gene pathogenicity scores for indiviual patients. The score corrects for the length of the gene and is intuitive to use. Unlike many mutation deleteriousness metrics, GenePy also takes into account the population frequency of the variant and the number of copies of any given mutation and combines data for as many variants as are present in a given gene for any one individual.\\n\\nIn this paper we apply the GenePy scoring system to a cohort of over 500 individuals for whom we have sequencing data across all genomics regions that code for protein. We descibe how GenePy performs and demonstrate superior sensitivity to detect known causal genes in a common autoimmune condition.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, Genome-wide Association studies (GWASs) have contributed to decoding the human genome by uncovering many genetic variations associated with various diseases. Many follow-up investigations involve joint analysis of multiple independently generated GWAS data sets. While most of the computational approaches developed for joint analysis are based on summary statistics, the joint analysis based on individual-level data with consideration of confounding factors remains to be a challenge. In this study, we propose a method, called Coupled Mixed Model (CMM), that enables a joint GWAS analysis on two independently collected sets of GWAS data with different phenotypes. The CMM method does not require the data sets to have the same phenotypes as it aims to infer the unknown phenotypes using a set of multivariate sparse mixed models. Moreover, CMM addresses the confounding variables due to population stratication, family structures, and cryptic relatedness, as well as those arising during data collection such as batch effects that frequently appear in joint genetic studies. We evaluate the performance of CMM using simulation experiments. In real data analysis, we illustrate the utility of CMM by an application to evaluating common genetic associations for Alzheimers disease and substance use disorder using datasets independently collected for the two complex human disorders. Comparison of the results with those from previous experiments and analyses supports the utility of our method and provides new insights into the diseases.\\n\\nThe software is available at https://github.com/HaohanWang/CMM",

    "abstract": "The human genome encodes ten insulin-like genes, whereas the C. elegans genome remarkably encodes forty insulin-like genes. The roles of insulin/insulin-like peptide ligands (INS) in C. elegans are not well understood. The functional redundancy of the forty INS genes makes it challenging to address their functions by using knock out strategies. Here, we individually overexpressed each of the forty ins genes pan-neuronally, and monitored multiple phenotypes including: L1 arrest life span, neuroblast divisions under L1 arrest, dauer formation and fat accumulation, as readouts to characterize the functions of each INS in vivo. Of the 40 INS peptides, we found functions for 35 INS peptides and functionally categorized each as agonists, antagonists or of pleiotropic function. In particular, we found that 9 of 16 agonistic INS peptides shortened L1 arrest life span and promoted neuroblast divisions during L1 arrest. Our study revealed that a subset of {beta}-class INS peptides that contain a distinct F peptide sequence are agonists. Our work is the first to categorize the structures of INS peptides and relate these structures to the functions of all forty INS peptides in vivo. Our findings will promote the study of insulin function on development, metabolism, and aging-related diseases.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryInsulin and insulin-like growth factors are found in all animals and regulate many physiological and developmental processes. The human genome has 10 insulin-like peptides including the well characterized insulin hormone. The nematode C. elegans has 40 insulin-like (INS) peptide genes. All 40 INS peptides have been knocked out but no single INS gene knock out resembles the loss of the C. elegans insulin receptor suggesting that the other INS peptides can compensate when one INS is lost. We have used a genetic approach to overexpress each of the 40 INS peptides in C. elegans and have identified in vivo function for 35 of the 40 INS peptides. Like the human insulin and IGF-1, C. elegans INS peptides are derived from a precursor protein and we have shown that INS peptides with an associated peptide called the F peptide are strong activators of the C. elegans insulin-like receptor. We also identified several INS peptides that inhibit the insulin-like receptor and these inhibitory INS peptides may have therapeutic potential.",

These original populations agree with the geographical distribution, phylogenies and recent admixture events of the studied groups.\\n\\nWith the growing population of multi-ethnic individuals, the matching process for stem-cell and solid organ transplants is becoming more challenging. The presented algorithm provides a framework that facilitates the breakdown of highly admixed populations into original groups, which can be used to better match the rapidly growing population of multi-ethnic individuals worldwide.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHuman Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) is known to be the most polymorphic region in the human genome. Anthropologists frequently use HLA to trace migration and evolution of different populations. This is due to the high linkage among HLA genes leading to the transmission of intact haplotypes from parents to offspring, hence preserving key population ancestral features.\\n\\nWe developed a new HLA-based method to identify admixture models in mixed populations using high-resolution HLA haplotype frequencies. Our results highlight that a single highly polymorphic locus can contain enough information to map clearly human admixture and the population genetics of the different human populations, and reproduces results based on SNP arrays.\\n\\nThe presented algorithm is validated using haplotype frequencies sampled from 56 worldwide populations. Under such factorization we demonstrate that 90% of the variance in these populations can be explained using a much-reduced set of 8 ethnic groups. We demonstrate that the estimated ethnic groups and admixture models agree with the geographical distribution, population phylogenies and recent historic admixture events of the studied populations.",

    "abstract": "Neuropeptide signaling influences animal behavior by modulating neuronal activity and thus altering circuit dynamics. Insect flight is a key innate behavior that very likely requires robust neuromodulation. Cellular and molecular components that help modulate flight behavior are therefore of interest and require investigation. In a genetic RNAi screen for G-protein coupled receptors that regulate flight bout durations, we earlier identified several receptors, including the receptor for the neuropeptide FMRFa (FMRFaR). To further investigate modulation of insect flight by FMRFa we generated CRISPR-Cas9 mutants in the gene encoding the Drosophila FMRFaR. The mutants exhibit significant flight deficits with a focus in dopaminergic cells. Expression of a receptor specific RNAi in adult central dopaminergic neurons resulted in progressive loss of sustained flight. Further, genetic and cellular assays demonstrated that FMRFaR stimulates intracellular calcium signaling through the IP3R and helps maintain neuronal excitability in a subset of dopaminergic neurons for positive modulation of flight bout durations.\\n\\nAuthor summaryNeuropeptides play an important role in modulating neuronal properties such as excitability and synaptic strength and thereby influence innate behavioral outputs. In flying insects, neuromodulation of flight has been primarily attributed to monoamines. In this study, we have used the genetically amenable fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster to identify a neuropeptide receptor that is required in adults to modulate flight behavior. We show from both knockdown and knockout studies that the neuropeptide receptor, FMRFaR, present on a few central dopaminergic neurons, modulates the duration of flight bouts. Overexpression of putative downstream molecules, the IP3R, an intracellular Ca2+-release channel, and CaMKII, a protein kinase, significantly rescue the flight deficits induced by knockdown of the FMRFaR. Our data support the idea that FMRFaR and CaMKII help maintain optimal membrane excitability of adult dopaminergic neurons required to sustain longer durations of flight bouts. We speculate that the ability to maintain longer flight bouts in natural conditions enhances the individuals capacity to search and reach food sources as well as find sites suitable for egg laying.",

    "abstract": "Here, we report an approach to detect diverse bacterial and fungal taxa in complex samples by direct analysis of community RNA in one step using NanoString probe sets. We designed rRNA-targeting probe sets to detect forty two bacterial and fungal genera or species common in cystic fibrosis (CF) sputum, and demonstrated taxon-specificity of these probes as well as a linear response over more than three logs of input RNA. Culture-based analyses correlated qualitatively with relative abundance data on bacterial and fungal taxa obtained by NanoString and the analysis of serial samples demonstrated the use of this method to simultaneously detect bacteria and fungi and to detect microbes at low abundance without an amplification step. The relative abundances of bacterial taxa detected by analysis of RNA correlated with the relative abundances of the same taxa as measured by sequencing of the V4V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene amplified from community DNA from the same sample. We propose that this method may complement other methods designed to understand dynamic microbial communities, may provide information on bacteria and fungi in the same sample with a single assay, and, with further development, may provide quick and easily-interpreted diagnostic information on diverse bacteria and fungi at the genus or species level.\\n\\nImportanceHere we demonstrate the use of an RNA-based analysis of specific taxa of interest, including bacteria and fungi, within microbial communities. This multiplex method may be useful as a means to identify samples with specific combinations of taxa and to gain information on how specific populations vary over time and space or in response to perturbation. A rapid means to measure bacterial and fungal populations may aid in the study of host response to changes in microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "Bud sport mutants of apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) trees with a highly blushed colouring pattern are mainly caused by the accumulation of anthocyanins in the pericarp. Hormones are important factors modulating anthocyanin accumulation. However, a good understanding of the interplay between hormones and anthocyanin synthesis in apples, especially in mutants at the molecular level, remains elusive. Here, physiological and comparative transcriptome approaches were used to reveal the molecular basis of pericarp pigmentation in  Red Delicious and its mutants, including  Starking Red,  Starkrimson,  Campbell Redchief and  Vallee spur, which were designated G0 to G4, respectively. Pericarp pigmentation gradually proliferated from G0 to G4. The anthocyanin content was higher in the mutants than in  Red Delicious. The activation of early phenylpropanoid biosynthesis genes, including ASP3, PAL, 4CL, PER, CHS, CYP98A and F3H, was responsible for anthocyanin accumulation in mutants. In addition, IAA and ABA had a positive regulatory effect on the synthesis of anthocyanins, while GA had the reverse effect. The down-regulation of AACT1, HMGS, HMGR, MVK, MVD2, IDI1 and FPPS2 involved in terpenoid biosynthesis influences anthocyanin accumulation by positively regulating transcripts of AUX1 and SAUR that contribute to the synthesis of IAA, GID2 to GA, PP2C and SnRK2 to ABA. Furthermore, MYB and bHLH members, which are highly correlated (r=0.882-0.980) with anthocyanin content, modulated anthocyanin accumulation by regulating the transcription of structural genes, including CHS and F3H, involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway.",

Activation of the STimulator of INterferon Genes (STING) by DMXAA can induce a strong production of IFN/{beta} and the rejection of transplanted primary tumors. In the present study, we addressed whether targeting STING with DMXAA also leads to the regression of spontaneous MMTV-PyMT mammary tumors. We show that these tumors are refractory to DMXAA-induced regression. This is due to a blockade in the phosphorylation of IRF3 and the ensuing IFN/{beta} production. Mechanistically, we identified TGF{beta} abundant in spontaneous tumors, as a key molecule limiting this IFN-induced-tumor regression by DMXAA. Finally, blocking TGF{beta} restores the production of IFN by activated MHCII+ tumor-associated macrophages, and enables tumor regression induced by STING activation. On the basis of these findings, we propose that type I IFN-dependent cancer therapies could be greatly improved by combinations including the blockade of TGF{beta}.",

    "abstract": "Atmospheric oxygen level rose dramatically around 2.4 billion years ago due to oxygenic photosynthesis by the Cyanobacteria. The oxidation of surface environments permanently changed the future of life on Earth, yet the evolutionary processes leading to oxygen production are poorly constrained. Partial records of these evolutionary steps are preserved in the genomes of organisms phylogenetically placed between non-photosynthetic Melainabacteria, crown-group Cyanobacteria, and Gloeobacter, representing the earliest-branching Cyanobacteria capable of oxygenic photosynthesis. Here, we describe nearly complete, metagenome assembled genomes of an uncultured organism phylogenetically placed between the Melainabacteria and crown-group Cyanobacteria, for which we propose the name Candidatus Aurora vandensis {au.rora Latin noun dawn and vand.ensis, originating from Vanda}.\\n\\nThe metagenome assembled genome of A. vandensis contains homologs of most genes necessary for oxygenic photosynthesis including key reaction center proteins. Many extrinsic proteins associated with the photosystems in other species are, however, missing or poorly conserved. The assembled genome also lacks homologs of genes associated with the pigments phycocyanoerethrin, phycoeretherin and several structural parts of the phycobilisome. Based on the content of the genome, we propose an evolutionary model for increasing efficiency of oxygenic photosynthesis through the evolution of extrinsic proteins to stabilize photosystem II and I reaction centers and improve photon capture. This model suggests that the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis may have significantly preceded oxidation of Earths atmosphere due to low net oxygen production by early Cyanobacteria.",

    "abstract": "The behavior of genetic circuits is often poorly predictable. A genes expression level is not only determined by the intended regulators, but also largely dictated by changes in ribosome availability imparted by activation or repression of other genes. To address this problem, we design a quasi-integral biomolecular feedback controller that enables the expression level of any gene of interest (GOI) to adapt to changes in available ribosomes. The feedback is implemented through a synthetic small RNA (sRNA) that silences the GOIs mRNA, and uses orthogonal extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor to sense the GOIs translation and to actuate sRNA transcription. Without the controller, the expression level of the GOI is reduced by 50% when a resource competitor is activated. With the controller, by contrast, gene expression level is practically unaffected by the competitor. This feedback controller allows adaptation of genetic modules to variable ribosome demand and thus aids modular construction of complicated circuits.",

This protocol has been modified from previous published reports with additional antibiotics and washing steps added to eliminate microbial contamination from the surgical source. Cell characterization was carried out using immunofluorescence and quantitative PCR. Eleven stable epithelial renal tumour cell lines of various subtypes, including rare subtypes, were established with a spontaneous immortalization rate of 21.6% using this protocol. Eight fibroblast cell cultures grew successfully but did not achieve spontaneous immortalization. Cells of epithelial origin expressed higher expression of epithelial markers such as pan-cytokeratin, CK8 and E-cadherin whereas fibroblast cells expressed high -SMA.

    "abstract": "Reducing the number of animals used in experiments has become a priority for the governments of many countries. For these reductions to occur, animal-free alternatives must be made more available and, crucially, must be embraced by researchers. We conducted an international online survey for academics in the field of animal science (N=367) to explore researchers attitudes towards the implementation of animal-free innovations.\\n\\nThrough this survey we address three key questions. The first question is whether scientists who use animals in their research consider governmental goals for animal-free innovations achievable and whether they would support such goals. Secondly, responders were asked to rank the importance of ten roadblocks that could hamper the implementation of animal-free innovations. Finally, responders were asked whether they would migrate (either themselves or their research) if increased animal research regulations in their country of residence restricted their research. While nearly half (40%) of the responders support governmental goals, the majority (71%) of researchers did not consider such goals achievable in their field within the near future. In terms of roadblocks for implementation of animal-free methods, [~]80% of the responders considered  reliability as important, making it the most highly ranked roadblock. However, all other roadblocks were reported by the majority of responders as somewhat important, suggesting that they must also be considered when addressing animal-free innovations. Importantly, a majority reported that they would consider migration to another country in response to restrictive animal research policy. Thus, governments must consider the risk of researchers migrating to other institutes, states or countries, leading to a  brain-drain if policies are too strict or suitable animal-free alternatives are not available. Our findings suggest that development and implementation of animal-free innovations are hampered by multiple factors. We outline three pillars concerning education, governmental influence and data sharing, the implementation of which may help to overcome these roadblocks to animal-free innovations.",

However, whether axial scaling is conserved in woody plants of the understory, the environments of most basal-grade angiosperms, remains mysterious. We used seedlings and adult plants of the shrub Illicium parviflorum to explore the anatomy and physiology of the phloem in their aerial parts, and possible changes through ontogeny. Adult plants maintain a similar proportion of phloem tissue across stem diameters, but scaling of conduit dimensions and number decreases the hydraulic resistance towards the base of the plant. Yet, the small sieve plate pores resulted in an overall higher sieve tube hydraulic resistance than has been reported in other woody angiosperms. Sieve elements scaled from minor to major leaf veins, but were shorter and narrower in petioles. The low carbon assimilation rates of seedlings and mature plants contrasted with a three-fold higher phloem sap velocity in seedlings, suggesting that phloem transport velocity is modulated through ontogeny. While the overall architecture of the phloem tissue in basal-angiosperm understory shrubs scales in a manner consistent with trees, modification of conduit connections may have allowed woody angiosperms to extend beyond their understory origins.",

    "abstract": "In bottom-up proteomics, peptides are separated by liquid chromatography with elution peak widths in the range of seconds, while mass spectra are acquired in about 100 microseconds with time-of-fight (TOF) instruments. This allows adding ion mobility as a third dimension of separation. Among several formats, trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) is attractive due to its small size, low voltage requirements and high efficiency of ion utilization. We have recently demonstrated a scan mode termed parallel accumulation - serial fragmentation (PASEF), which multiplies the sequencing speed without any loss in sensitivity (Meier et al., PMID: 26538118). Here we introduce the timsTOF Pro instrument, which optimally implements online PASEF. It features an orthogonal ion path into the ion mobility device, limiting the amount of debris entering the instrument and making it very robust in daily operation. We investigate different precursor selection schemes for shotgun proteomics to optimally allocate in excess of 100 fragmentation events per second. More than 800,000 fragmentation spectra in standard 120 min LC runs are easily achievable, which can be used for near exhaustive precursor selection in complex mixtures or re-sequencing weak precursors. MaxQuant identified more than 6,400 proteins in single run HeLa analyses without matching to a library, and with high quantitative reproducibility (R > 0.97). Online PASEF achieves a remarkable sensitivity with more than 2,900 proteins identified in 30 min runs of only 10 ng HeLa digest. We also show that highly reproducible collisional cross sections can be acquired on a large scale (R > 0.99). PASEF on the timsTOF Pro is a valuable addition to the technological toolbox in proteomics, with a number of unique operating modes that are only beginning to be explored.",

    "abstract": "The inclusion of exons during the splicing process depends on the binding of splicing factors to short low-complexity regulatory sequences. The relationship between exonic splicing regulatory sequences and coding sequences is still poorly understood. We demonstrate that exons that are coregulated by any splicing factor share a similar nucleotide composition bias. We next demonstrate that coregulated exons preferentially code for amino acids with similar physicochemical properties because of the non-randomness properties of the genetic code. Indeed, amino acids sharing physicochemical properties correspond to codons that have the same nucleotide composition bias. These observations reveal an unanticipated bidirectional interplay between the physicochemical features encoded by exons and exon splicing regulation by splicing factors. We propose that the splicing regulation of an exon by a splicing factor is tightly interconnected with the physicochemical properties of the exon-encoded protein domain depending on the splicing-factor affinity for specific nucleotides.",

    "abstract": "Cotton rats are an important animal model to study infectious diseases. They have demonstrated higher susceptibility to a wider variety of human pathogens than other rodents and are also the animal model of choice for pre-clinical evaluations of some vaccine candidates. However, the genome of cotton rats remains to be fully sequenced, with much fewer genes cloned and characterised compared to other rodent species. Here we report the cloning and characterization of CD40 ligand, whose human and murine counterparts are known to be expressed on a range of cell types including activated T cells and B cells, dendritic cells, granulocytes, macrophages and platelets and exerts a broad array of immune responses. The cDNA for cotton rat CD40L we isolated is comprised of 1104 nucleotides with an open reading frame (ORF) of 783bp coding for a 260 amino acid protein. The recombinant cotton rat CD40L protein was recognized by an antibody against mouse CD40L. Moreover, it demonstrated functional activities on immature bone marrow dendritic cells by upregulating surface maturation markers (CD40, CD54, CD80, and CD86), and increasing IL-6 gene and protein expression. The availability of CD40L gene identity could greatly facilitate mechanistic research on pathogen-induced-immunopathogenesis and vaccine-elicited immune responses.",

    "abstract": "High-dimensional single cell profiling coupled with computational modeling is emerging as a powerful means to elucidate developmental sequences and define genetic programs directing cell lineages. Here we introduce tSpace, an algorithm based on the concept of \\\"trajectory space\\\", in which cells are defined by their distance along nearest neighbor pathways to every other cell in a population. tSpace outputs a dense matrix of cell-to-cell distances that quantitatively reflect the extent of phenotypic change along developmental paths (developmental distances). Graphical mapping of cells in trajectory space allows unsupervised reconstruction and straightforward exploration of complex developmental sequences. tSpace is robust, scalable, and implements a global approach that attempts to preserve both local and distant relationships in developmental pathways. Applied to high dimensional flow and mass cytometry data, the method faithfully reconstructs known pathways of thymic T cell development and provides novel insights into regulation of tonsillar B cell development and trafficking. Applied to single cell transcriptomic data, the method unfolds complex developmental sequences, recapitulates pathways leading from intestinal stem cells to specialized epithelial phenotypes more faithfully than existing algorithms, and reveals genetic programs that correlate with fate decisions. tSpace profiling of complex populations in high-dimensional trajectory space is well suited for hypothesis generation in developing cell systems.",

    "abstract": "Notch signaling and its effector Hes1 regulate multiple cell fate choices in the developing pancreas, but few direct target genes are known. Here we use transcriptome analyses combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify direct target genes of Hes1. ChIP-seq analysis of endogenous Hes1 in 266-6 cells, a model of multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells, revealed high-confidence peaks associated with 354 genes. Among these were genes important for tip/trunk segregation such as Ptf1a and Nkx6-1, genes involved in endocrine differentiation such as Insm1 and Dll4, and genes encoding non-pancreatic basic-Helic-Loop-Helix (bHLH) factors such as Neurog2 and Ascl1. Surprisingly, we find that Hes1 binds a large number of loci previously reported to bind Ptf1a, including a site downstream of the Nkx6-1 gene. Notably, we find a number of Hes1 bound genes that are upregulated by {gamma}-secretase inhibition in pancreas explants independently of Neurog3 function, including the tip progenitor/acinar genes; Ptf1a, Gata4, Bhlha15, and Gfi1. Together, our data suggest that Notch signaling suppress the tip cell fate by Hes1-mediated repression of the tip-specific gene regulatory network module that includes transcriptional regulators such as Ptf1a, Gata4, Mist1, and Gfi1. Our data also uncover new molecular targets of Notch signaling that may be important for controlling cell fate choices in pancreas development.",

However, the impacts of the multifork on the evolution and genetic engineering are still vague. Here, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock-out eighteen Escherichia coli chromosomal fragments (over 50 kb) that represent all areas of the chromosome. We demonstrated that a single cell could have wild-type, color-reporter, and antibiotic-resistant genes simultaneously in the same locus of the different branches of the duplication forks after multiple rounds of deletions and replacements. This phenomenon that a single cell had different genotypes in its local polyploid chromosomes, which was similar to eukaryotic heterozygote, was named as local polyploidy. Under a defined selective pressure condition, offspring cells containing at least a copy of conditionally beneficial mutation could be enriched, and other alleles could be kept silently and peacefully in the duplication fork(s) of the same cell. The significance of this phenomenon in the genetic engineering was discussed.",

    "abstract": "Control of gene expression at the translation level is increasingly regarded as a key feature in many biological processes. Simple, inexpensive, and reliable procedures to visualise sites of protein production are required to allow observation of the spatiotemporal patterns of mRNA translation at subcellular resolution. We present a method, named SPoT (for Subcellular Patterns of Translation), developed upon the original TimeStamp technique (Lin et al., 2008), consisting in the expression of a fluorescent protein fused to a tagged, self-cleavable protease domain. Addition of a cell-permeable protease inhibitor instantly stabilizes newly produced, tagged protein allowing to distinguish recently synthesized protein from more ancient one. After a brief protease inhibitor treatment, the ratio of tagged vs non-tagged forms is highest at sites where proteins are the most recent, i.e. sites of synthesis. Therefore, by comparing tagged and non-tagged protein it is possible to spotlight sites of translation. By specifically expressing the SPoT cassette in neurons of transgenic zebrafish embryos, we reveal sites of neuronal protein synthesis in diverse cellular compartments during early development.",

    "abstract": "GWAS have identified numerous SNPs associated with prostate cancer risk. One such SNP is rs10993994. It is located in the MSMB promoter, associates with MSMB encoded {beta}-microseminoprotein prostate secretion levels, and is associated with mRNA expression changes in MSMB and the adjacent gene NCOA4. In addition, our previous work showed a second SNP, rs7098889, is in LD with rs10993994 and associated with MSMB expression independent of rs10993994. Here, we generate a series of clones with single alleles removed by double guide RNA (gRNA) mediated CRISPR/Cas9 deletions, through which we demonstrate that each of these SNPs independently and greatly alters MSMB expression in an allele-specific manner. We further show that these SNPs have no substantial effect on the expression of NCOA4. These data demonstrate that a single SNP can have a large effect on gene expression and illustrate the importance of functional validation to deconvolute observed correlations. The method we have developed is generally applicable to test any SNP for which a relevant heterozygous cell line is available.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn pursuing the underlying biological mechanism of prostate cancer pathogenesis, scientists utilized the existence of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human genome as genetic markers to perform large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) and have so far identified more than a hundred prostate cancer risk variants. Such variants provide an unbiased and systematic new venue to study the disease mechanism, and the next big challenge is to translate these genetic associations to the causal role of altered gene function in oncogenesis. The majority of these variants are waiting to be studied and lots of them may act in oncogenesis through gene expression regulation. To prove the concept, we took rs10993994 and its linked rs7098889 as an example and engineered single cell clones by allelic-specific CRISPR/Cas9 deletion to separate the effect of each allele. We observed that a single nucleotide difference would lead to surprisingly high level of MSMB gene expression change in a gene specific and tissue specific manner. Our study strongly supports the notion that differential level of gene expression caused by risk variants and their associated genetic locus play a major role in oncogenesis and also highlights the importance of studying the function of MSMB encoded {beta}-MSP in prostate cancer pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "It is often assumed that word reading proceeds automatically. Here, we tested this assumption by recording event-related potentials during a psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm, requiring lexical decisions about written words. Specifically, we selected words differing in their orthographic neighborhood size - the number of words that can be obtained from a target by exchanging a single letter - and investigated how influences of this variable depend on the availability of central attention. As expected, when attentional resources for lexical decisions were unconstrained, words with many orthographic neighbors elicited larger N400 amplitudes than those with few neighbors. However, under conditions of high temporal overlap with a high priority primary task, the N400 effect disappeared. This finding indicates strong attentional influences on the incidental processing of orthographic neighbors during word reading, providing novel evidence against the automaticity of processes involved in word reading. Furthermore, in conjunction with the observation of an underadditive interaction between stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) and orthographic neighborhood size in lexical decision performance, commonly taken to indicate automaticity, our results raise issues concerning the standard logic of cognitive slack in the PRP paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Recent interest in reversal of the hypnotic effects of anesthesia has mainly focused on overcoming a surge in GABA-mediated inhibitory signaling through activation of subcortical arousal circuits or antagonizing GABA receptors. Here we examine the reversal of anesthesia produced from non-GABA agents ketamine/xylazine and the effects of antagonists of adrenoreceptors. These antagonists vary in selectivity and produce temporally unique waking behavior post-anesthesia. We compared two antagonists with differential selectivity for 1-vs. 2-receptors, yohimbine (YOH, 1:40 selectivity) and atipamezole (ATI, 1:8500). Adult mice received intraperitoneal injections of either YOH (4.3 mg/kg), ATI (0.4 mg/kg), or saline after achieving sustained loss of righting following injection of ketamine/xylazine (ketamine: 65.0 mg/kg; xylazine: 9.9 mg/kg). Behaviors indicative of the post-anesthesia, re-animation sequence were carefully monitored and the timing of each behavior relative to anesthesia induction was compared. Both YOH and ATI hastened behaviors indicative of emergence, but ATI was faster than YOH to produce certain behaviors, including whisker movement (YOH: 21.9{+/-}1.5 min, ATI: 17.5{+/-}0.5 min, p=0.004) and return of righting reflex (RORR) (YOH: 40.6{+/-}8.8 min, ATI: 26.0{+/-}1.2 min, p<0.001). Interestingly, although YOH administration hastened early behavioral markers of emergence relative to saline (whisking), the completion of the emergence sequence (time from first marker to appearance of RORR) was delayed with YOH. We attribute this effect to antagonism of 1 receptors by yohimbine. Also notable was the failure of either antagonist to hasten the re-establishment of coordinated motor behavior (e.g., attempts to remove adhesive tape on the forepaw placed during anesthesia) relative to the end of emergence (RORR). In total, our work suggests that in addition to pharmacokinetic effects, re-establishment of normal waking behaviors after anesthesia involves neuronal circuits dependent on time and/or activity.",

Leaf extracts from 14 Passiflora (P.) species were obtained ASE and in vitro cytotoxicity evaluated against cancer cell lines using MTT assay at a single concentration of 50 g/mL. Additionally, the IC50 of the P. alata (ELPA) leaf extracts was determined against both tumor (HCT-116, SF-295, OVACAR-8, and HL-60), and non-tumor cells (PBMC). The ELPA flavonoids were identified by HPLC-DAD and UHPLC-MS/MS. The morphological analyses used light and fluorescence microscopy, and cell cycle and DNA fragmentation analyses used flow cytometry to determine the mechanism of cell death induced by ELPA in HL-60. Among the Passiflora leaf extracts evaluated; ELPA stood out with high cytotoxic activity, followed by P. capsularis and P. quadrangulares with varying high and low cytotoxic activity. ELPA presented high cytotoxic potency in HL-60 (IC50 19.37 g/mL), yet without cytotoxic activity against PBMC, suggesting selectivity for tumor cells. The cytotoxic activity of ELPA may well be linked to the presence of ten identified flavonoids. Cells treated with ELPA presented the hallmarks typical of apoptosis and necrosis, with cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Conclusion: From among the studied species, ELPA presented greater cytotoxic activity, possibly a consequence of synergistic flavonoid action which induces cell death by apoptosis and necrosis.",

It requires immediate treatment, which is why the development of tools for planning therapeutic interventions is required to deal with shock in the critical care environment. In this study, the ShockOmics European project original database is used to extract attributes capable of predicting mortality due to shock in the ICU. Missing data imputation techniques and machine learning models were used, followed by feature selection from different data subsets. Selected features were later used to build Bayesian Networks, revealing causal relationships between features and ICU outcome. The main result is a subset of predictive features that includes well-known indicators such as the SOFA and APACHE II scores, but also less commonly considered ones related to cardiovascular function assessed through echocardiograpy or shock treatment with pressors. Importantly, certain selected features are shown to be most predictive at certain time-steps. This means that, as shock progresses, different attributes could be prioritized. Clinical traits obtained at 24h. from ICU admission are shown to accurately predict cardiogenic and septic shock mortality, suggesting that relevant life-saving decisions could be made shortly after ICU admission.",

    "abstract": "The fungal fatty acid synthase (fFAS) multienzyme is a barrel-shaped 2.6 MDa complex comprising six times eight catalytic domains. Upon barrel-formation, up to several hundred kDa large polypeptides intertwine to bury about 170,000 [A]2 of protein surface. Functional, regulatory and structural data as well as evolutionary aspects of fFAS have been elucidated during the last decades. Notwithstanding a profound knowledge of this protein family, the biogenesis of the elaborate structure remained elusive. Remarkably, experimental data have recently demonstrated that fFAS self-assembles without the assistance of specific factors. Considering the infinitesimal probability that the barrel-shaped complex forms simply by domains approaching in the correct orientation, we were interested in understanding the sequence of events that have to orchestrate fFAS assembly. Here, we show that fFAS attains its quaternary structure along a pathway of successive domain-domain interactions, which is strongly related to the evolutionary development of this protein family. The knowledge on fFAS assembly may pave the way towards antifungal therapy, and further develops fFAS as biofactory in technological applications.",
