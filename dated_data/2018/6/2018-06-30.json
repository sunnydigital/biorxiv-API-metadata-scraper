    "abstract": "We exploited the high Ras activity induced differentiation of supernumerary R7 cells in Drosophila eyes to examine if hsr{omega} lncRNAs influence active Ras signaling. Surprisingly, either down- or up-regulation of hsr{omega} lncRNAs in sev-GAL4>RasV12 expressing eye discs resulted in complete pupal lethality and substantially greater increase in R7 photoreceptor number at the expense of cone cells. Enhanced nuclear p-MAPK and presence of sev-GAL4 driven RasV12 bound RafRBDFLAG in cells not expressing the sev-GAL4 driver indicated non-cell autonomous spread of Ras signaling when hsr{omega} levels were co-altered. RNA-sequencing revealed that down-and up-regulation of hsr{omega} transcripts in sev-GAL4>RasV12 expressing eye discs elevated transcripts of positive or negative modulators, respectively, of Ras signaling so that either condition enhances it. Altered hsr{omega} transcript levels in sev-GAL4>RasV12 expressing discs also affected sn/sno/sca RNAs and some other RNA processing transcript levels. Post-transcriptional changes due to the disrupted intra-cellular dynamicity of omega speckle associated hnRNPs and other RNA-binding proteins that follow down- or up-regulation of hsr{omega} lncRNAs appear to be responsible for the further elevated Ras signaling. Cell autonomous and non-autonomous enhancement of Ras signaling by lncRNAs like hsr{omega} has implications for cell signaling during high Ras activity commonly associated with some cancers.\\n\\nHighlightsOur findings highlight roles of hsr{omega} lncRNAs in conditionally modulating the important Ras signaling pathway and provide evidence for cell non-autonomous Ras signaling in Drosophila eye discs.",

    "abstract": "Rhythmic animal behaviors are regulated in part by neural circuits called the central pattern generators (CPGs). Classifying neural population activities correlated with body movements and identifying the associated component neurons are critical steps in understanding CPGs. Previous methods that classify neural dynamics obtained by dimension reduction algorithms often require manual optimization which could be laborious and preparation-specific. Here, we present a simpler and more flexible method that is based on the pre-trained convolutional neural network model VGG-16 and unsupervised learning, and successfully classifies the fictive motor patterns in Drosophila larvae under various imaging conditions. We also used voxel-wise correlation mapping to identify neurons associated with motor patterns. By applying these methods to neurons targeted by 5-HT2A-GAL4, which we generated by the CRISPR/Cas9-system, we identified two classes of interneurons, termed Seta and Leta, which are specifically active during backward but not forward fictive locomotion. Optogenetic activation of Seta and Leta neurons increased backward locomotion. Conversely, thermogenetic inhibition of 5-HT2A-GAL4 neurons or application of a 5-HT2 antagonist decreased backward locomotion induced by noxious light stimuli. This study establishes an accelerated pipeline for activity profiling and cell identification in larval Drosophila and implicates the serotonergic system in the modulation of backward locomotion.",

    "abstract": "AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThe Windover mortuary pond dates to the Early Archaic period (6,800-5,200 years ago) and constitutes one of the earliest archaeological sites with intact and well-preserved human remains in North America. Unlike many prehistoric egalitarian hunter-gatherers, the Windover people may not have practiced a sex-based division of labor, rather they may have shared the load. We explore how mobility and subsistence, as reconstructed from archaeological data, influenced hand and foot bone morphology at Windover.\\n\\nMethodsWe took length and width measurements on four carpal bones, four tarsal bones, and load- bearing tarsal areas (calcaneus load arm, trochlea of the talus). We analyzed lateralization using side differences in raw length and width measurements. For other hypothesis testing, we used log transformed length-width ratios to mitigate the confounding effects of sexual dimorphism and trait size variation; we tested between-sex differences in weight-bearing (rear foot) and shock-absorbing (mid foot) tarsal bones and between-sex differences in carpal bones.\\n\\nResultsWe identified no significant between-sex differences in rear and midfoot areas, suggesting similar biomechanical stresses. We identified no significant between-sex differences in carpal bones but the test was under-powered due to small sample sizes. Finally, despite widespread behavioral evidence on contemporary populations for human hand and foot lateralization, we found no evidence of either handedness or footedness.\\n\\nDiscussionThe lack evidence for footedness was expected due its minimal impact on walking gait but the lack of evidence for handedness was surprising given that ethnographic studies have shown strong handedness in hunter-gatherers during tool and goods manufacture. The reconstructed activity patterns suggested both sexes engaged in heavy load carrying and a shared division of labor. Our results support previous findings--both sexes had stronger weight-bearing bones. While male shock-absorbing bones exhibited a trend towards greater relative width (suggesting greater comparative biomechanical stress), this may simply some lingering hunting behavior with males walking greater distances at higher speeds than females. While there were no significant between-sex differences in carpal bones (supporting a shared work load model), females exhibited greater variation in index values, which may reflect a greater variety of and specialization in tasks compared to males. Because carpals and tarsals are so well- preserved at archaeological sites, we had surmised they might be useful proxies for activity in the absence of well-preserved long bones. Tarsals provide a stronger signal of past activity and may be useful in the absence or, or in addition to, preferred bones. Carpals, however, may not be useful as the effect size of biomechanical stress (in this study at least) is low and would require larger samples than may be possible at archaeological sites.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChromatin interactions are essential in enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) and transcriptional regulation. CTCF and cohesin proteins located at chromatin interaction anchors and other DNA-binding proteins such as YY1, ZNF143, and SMARCA4 are involved in chromatin interactions. However, there is still no good overall understanding of proteins associated with chromatin interactions and insulator functions.\n\nResultsHere, I describe a systematic and comprehensive approach for discovering DNA-binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs) that affect EPIs and gene expression. This analysis identified 96 biased orientations [64 forward-reverse (FR) and 52 reverse-forward (RF)] of motifs that significantly affected the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes in monocytes, T cells, HMEC, and NPC and included CTCF, cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3), YY1, and ZNF143; some TFs have more than one motif in databases; thus, the total number is smaller than the sum of FRs and RFs. KLF4, ERG, RFX, RFX2, HIF1, SP1, STAT3, and AP1 were associated with chromatin interactions. Many other TFs were also known to have chromatin-associated functions. The predicted biased orientations of motifs were compared with chromatin interaction data. Correlations in expression level of nearby genes separated by the motif sites were then examined among 53 tissues.\n\nConclusionOne hundred FR and RF orientations associated with chromatin interactions and functions were discovered. Most TFs showed weak directional biases at chromatin interaction anchors and were difficult to identify using enrichment analysis of motifs. These findings contribute to the understanding of chromatin-associated motifs involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin interactions/regulation, and histone modifications.",

We show that repeated induction of the C. elegans flight response inhibits conserved cytoprotective mechanisms. This acute-stress response activates neurons that release tyramine, the invertebrate analog of adrenaline/noradrenaline. Tyramine stimulates the DAF-2/Insulin/IGF-1 pathway and precludes the nuclear translocation of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor through the activation of an adrenergic-like receptor TYRA-3 in the intestine. In contrast, environmental long-term stressors, such as heat or oxidative stress, reduce tyramine release allowing the induction of FOXO-dependent cytoprotective genes. These findings demonstrate how a neural stress-hormone signaling provides a state-dependent neural switch between acute and long-term stress responses, and provide mechanistic insights how acute stress impairs cellular defensive systems.\\n\\nOne Sentence Summary: The \\\"fight-or-flight\\\" response reduces resistance to environmental challenges.",

In Toxoplasma gondii and other apicomplexan parasites, many subunit components, necessary for proper assembly and functioning of this enzyme, appear to be missing. Here, we report the identification of 20 novel subunits of T. gondii F-type ATP synthase from mass spectrometry analysis of partially purified monomeric (~600 kDa) and dimeric (>1 MDa) forms of the enzyme. Despite extreme sequence diversification, key FO subunits, a, b and d, can be identified from conserved structural features. Orthologs for these proteins are restricted to apicomplexan, chromerid and dinoflagellate species. Interestingly, their absence in ciliates indicates a major diversion, with respect to subunit composition of this enzyme, within the alveolate clade. Discovery of these highly diversified novel components of the apicomplexan F-type ATP synthase complex could facilitate the development of novel anti-parasitic agents. Structural and functional characterization of this unusual enzyme complex will advance our fundamental understanding of energy metabolism in apicomplexan species.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe persistence of schizophrenia in human populations separated by geography and time led to the evolutionary hypothesis that proposes schizophrenia as a by-product of the higher cognitive abilities of modern humans. To explore this hypothesis, we used here an evolutionary epigenetics approach building on differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of the genome.\\n\\nMethodsWe implemented a polygenic enrichment testing pipeline using the summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of schizophrenia and 12 other phenotypes. We investigated the enrichment of association of these traits across genomic regions with variable methylation between modern humans and great apes (orangutans, chimpanzees and gorillas; primate DMRs) and between modern humans and recently extinct hominids (Neanderthals and Denisovans; non-primate DMRs).\\n\\nResultsRegions that are hypo-methylated in humans compared to great apes show enrichment of association with schizophrenia only if the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region is included. With the MHC region removed from the analysis, only a modest enrichment for SNPs of low effect persists. The INRICH pipeline confirms this finding after rigorous permutation and bootstrapping procedures.\\n\\nConclusionThe analyses of regions with differential methylation changes in humans and great apes do not provide compelling evidence of enrichment of association with schizophrenia, in contrast to our previous findings on more recent methylation differences between modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans. Our results further support the evolutionary hypothesis of schizophrenia and indicate that the origin of some of the genetic susceptibility factors of schizophrenia may lie in recent human evolution.",

Computational models have been used to study the underlying neural mechanisms, but neglected the important role of short- and long-term memory interactions (STM, LTM) for WM. Here, we investigate these using a novel multi-area spiking neural network model of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and two parieto-temporal cortical areas based on macaque data. We propose a WM indexing theory that explains how PFC could associate, maintain and update multi-modal LTM representations. Our simulations demonstrate how simultaneous, brief multi-modal memory cues could build a temporary joint memory representation as an \\\"index\\\" in PFC by means of fast Hebbian synaptic plasticity. This index can then reactivate spontaneously and thereby reactivate the associated LTM representations. Cueing one LTM item rapidly pattern-completes the associated un-cued item via PFC. The PFC-STM network updates flexibly as new stimuli arrive thereby gradually over-writing older representations.",

In this work, we have combined facile nuclear sub-fractionation approaches with data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry to improve detection and quantification of nuclear proteins in human cells and tissues. Nuclei are isolated and subjected to a series of extraction conditions that enrich for nucleoplasm, euchromatin, heterochromatin and nuclear-membrane associated proteins. Using this approach, we can measure peptides from over 70% of the expressed nuclear proteome. As we are physically separating chromatin compartments prior to analysis, proteins can be assigned into functional chromatin environments to illuminate systems-wide nuclear protein dynamics. The integrity of nuclear sub-compartments were validated with immunofluorescence, which confirms the presence of key markers during chromatin extraction. We then apply this method to study the nuclear proteome-wide response to pharmacological degradation of the BET bromodomain proteins. BET degradation leads to widespread changes in chromatin composition, and we discover global HDAC1/2-mediated remodeling of chromatin previously bound by BET bromodomains. In summary, we have developed a technology for reproducible, comprehensive characterization of the nuclear proteome to observe the systems-wide nuclear protein dynamics.",

Despite being well-described clinically, the contribution of effector organs such as the liver to the pathogenesis of these diseases is poorly understood. Here, we utilize a patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based model of hereditary transthyretin (TTR) amyloid disease (ATTR amyloidosis) in order to define the contributions of hepatic cells to the distal proteotoxicity of secreted TTR. To this end, we employ a gene correction strategy to generate isogenic, ATTR amyloidosis patient-specific iPSCs expressing either amyloidogenic or wild-type TTR. We further utilize this gene editing strategy in combination with single cell RNAseq to identify multiple hepatic proteostasis factors, including many components of adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathways, whose expression correlates with the production of destabilized TTR variants in iPSC-derived hepatic cells. We further demonstrate that enhancing ER proteostasis within ATTR amyloidosis iPSC-derived hepatic lineages via stress-independent activation of aforementioned adaptive UPR signaling preferentially reduces the secretion of destabilized amyloidogenic TTR. Together, these results suggest the potential of the liver to chaperone-at-a-distance and impact pathogenesis at downstream target cells in the context of systemic amyloid disease, and further highlight the promise of UPR modulating therapeutics for the treatment of TTR-mediated and other amyloid diseases.",

Two bioinformatics pipelines, GATK and SAMtools, were used to identify ~21K transcribed SNPs with allelic imbalances associated with important aquaculture production traits including body weight, muscle yield, muscle fat content, shear force, and whiteness in addition to resistance/susceptibility to bacterial cold-water disease (BCWD). SNPs were identified from pooled RNA-Seq data collected from ~620 fish, representing 98 families from growth- and 54 families from BCWD-selected lines with divergent phenotypes. In addition, ~29K transcribed SNPs without allelic-imbalances were strategically added to build a 50K Affymetrix SNP-chip. SNPs selected included two SNPs per gene from 14K genes and ~5K non-synonymous SNPs. The SNP-chip was used to genotype 1728 fish. The average SNP calling-rate for samples passing quality control (QC; 1,641 fish) was [&ge;] 98.5%. Genome-wide association (GWA) study on 878 fish (representing 197 families from 2 consecutive generations) with muscle yield phenotypes and genotyped for 35K polymorphic markers (passing QC) identified several QTL regions explaining together up to 28.40% of the additive genetic variance for muscle yield in this rainbow trout population. The most significant QTLs were on chromosomes 14 and 16 with 12.71% and 10.49% of the genetic variance, respectively.

With this method, homopolymeric runs can be used for writing DNA in a data storage capacity, where a stretch of As, for example, will be read as a single base, and the transitions between successive homopolymer runs encodes information.

    "abstract": "BackgroundOver 80% of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) suffer from cachexia, characterized by severe muscle and fat loss. Although various model systems have improved our understanding of cachexia, translating the findings to human cachexia has remained a challenge. In this study, our objectives were to i) identify circulating protein biomarkers using serum for human PDAC cachexia, (ii) identify the ontological functions of the identified biomarkers and (iii) identify new pathways associated with human PDAC cachexia by performing protein co-expression analysis.\\n\\nMethodsSerum from 30 patients with PDAC was collected. Body composition measurements of skeletal muscle index (SMI), skeletal muscle density (SMD), total adipose index (TAI) were obtained from computed tomography scans (CT). Cancer associated weight loss (CAWL), an ordinal classification of history of weight loss and body mass index (BMI) was obtained from medical record. Serum protein profiles and concentrations were generated using SOMAscan, a quantitative aptamer-based assay. Ontological analysis of the proteins correlated with clinical variables (r[&ge;] 0.5 and p<0.05) was performed using DAVID Bioinformatics. Protein co-expression analysis was determined using pairwise Spearmans correlation.\\n\\nResultsOverall, 111 proteins of 1298 correlated with these clinical measures, 48 proteins for CAWL, 19 for SMI, 14 for SMD, and 30 for TAI. LYVE1, a homolog of CD44 implicated in tumor metastasis, was the top CAWL-associated protein (r= 0.67, p=0.0001). Other proteins such as INHBA, MSTN/GDF11, and PIK3R1 strongly correlated with CAWL. Proteins correlated with cachexia included those associated with proteolysis, acute inflammatory response, as well as B cell and T cell activation. Protein co-expression analysis identified networks such as activation of immune related pathways such as B-cell signaling, Th1 and Th2 pathways, natural killer cell signaling, IL6 signaling, and mitochondrial dysfunction.\\n\\nConclusionTaken together, these data both identify immune system molecules and additional secreted factors and pathways not previously associated with PDAC and confirm the activation of previously identified pathways. Identifying altered secreted factors in serum of PDAC patients may assist in developing minimally invasive laboratory tests for clinical cachexia as well as identifying new mediators.",

    "abstract": "Complexity of life forms on Earth has increased tremendously, primarily driven by subsequent evolutionary transitions in individuality, a mechanism in which units formerly being capable of independent replication combine to form higher-level evolutionary units. Although this process has been likened to the recursive combination of pre-adapted subsolutions in the framework of learning theory, no general mathematical formalization of this analogy has been provided yet. Here we show, building on former results connecting replicator dynamics and Bayesian update, that (i) evolution of a hierarchical population under multilevel selection is equivalent to Bayesian inference in hierarchical Bayesian models, and (ii) evolutionary transitions in individuality, driven by synergistic fitness interactions, is equivalent to learning the structure of hierarchical models via Bayesian model comparison. These correspondences support a learning theory oriented narrative of evolutionary complexification: the complexity and depth of the hierarchical structure of individuality mirrors the amount and complexity of data that has been integrated about the environment through the course of evolutionary history.",

    "abstract": "To understand the molecular differences between right-sided colon cancer (RCC), left-sided colon cancer (LCC) and rectal cancer, we analyzed colorectal tumors at the DNA, RNA, miRNA and protein levels using previously sequenced data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Clonal evolution analysis identified the same tumor-initiating events involving APC, KRAS and TP53 genes in RCC, LCC and rectal cancers. However, the individual role-played by each event, their order in tumor dynamics and selection of downstream mutations were distinct in all three anatomical locations, with some similarities noted between LCC and rectal cancer. We found a potentially targetable alteration APC R1450* specific to RCC that has not been previously described. Differential gene expression analysis revealed multiple genes within the homeobox, G-protein coupled receptor binding and transcription regulation families were dysregulated in RCC, LCC, and rectal cancers and may have a pathological role in these cancers. Further, using a novel in silico proteomic analytic tool developed by our research group, we found distinct central or hub proteins with unique interactomes in each location. Protein expression signatures were not necessarily concordant with the tumor profiles obtained at the DNA and RNA levels, underscoring the relevance of post-transcriptional events in defining the biology of these cancers beyond molecular changes at the DNA and/or RNA level. Ultimately, not only tumor location and the respective genomic profile but also protein-protein interactions will need to be taken into account to improve treatment outcomes of colorectal cancers. Further studies that take into account the alterations found in this study may help in developing more tailored, and perhaps more effective, treatment strategies.\\n\\nAuthor summaryPatients with right-sided colon cancer (RCC) has a worse prognosis compared to left-sided colon cancer (LCC). Recent data has also shown that wild-type RAS metastatic RCCs have poor outcomes when treated with the combination of chemotherapy and anti-EGFR therapy compared to LCC and rectal cancers. Therefore, There is an urgent unmet need to understand the molecular differences between RCC, LCC, and rectal cancers. In this study, we demonstrate clonal evolutionary trajectory and the order of mutations in RCC, LCC, and rectal cancers are distinct with some similarities between LCC and rectal cancers. The order of the mutations that lead to the acquisition of crucial driver alterations may have prognostic and therapeutic implications. We also discovered a novel targetable alteration, APC R1450* to be significantly enriched in early, late and metastatic RCC but not in LCC and rectal cancers. Amazingly, proteomic signatures were discordant with DNA and RNA levels. These distinct differences in DNA, RNA and post-transcriptional events may contribute to their unique clinicopathological features.\\n\\nConflict of Interest StatementAshiq Masood Advisory board and speaker Bureau Bristol-Myers Squibb and Boehringer Ingelheim\\n\\nJanakiraman Subramanian Advisory board - Astra Zeneca, Pfizer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Alexion, Paradigm, Bristol-Myers Squibb Speakers Bureau - Astra Zeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Lilly Research Support - Biocept and Paradigm\\n\\nArif Hussain Advisory board - Novartis, Bayer, Astra Zeneca Consultant - Bristol-Myers-Squibb All other authors have no conflict of interest.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 regulatory CD4+ T (Tr1) cells express high levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 but not the master transcription factor Foxp3, and can suppress inflammation and promote immune tolerance. In order to identify and obtain viable Tr1 cells for research and clinical applications, co-expression of CD49b and LAG3 has been proposed as a unique surface signature for both human and mouse Tr1 cells. However, recent studies have revealed that this pattern of co-expression is dependent on the stimulating conditions and the differentiation stage of the CD4+ T cells. Here, using an IL-10GFP/Foxp3RFP dual reporter transgenic murine model, we demonstrate that co-expression of CD49b and LAG3 is not restricted to the Foxp3- Tr1 cells, but is also observed in Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells and CD8+ T cells that produce IL-10. Our data indicate that IL-10-producing Tr1 cells, Treg cells and CD8+ T cells are all capable of co-expressing LAG3 and CD49b in vitro following differentiation under IL-10-inducing conditions, and in vivo following pathogenic insult or infection in the pulmonary mucosa. Our findings urge caution in the use of LAG3/CD49b co-expression to identify Tr1 cells, since it may mark IL-10-producing T cell lineages more broadly, including the Foxp3- Tr1 cells, Foxp3+ Treg cells and CD8+ T cells.",

This study aims to predict the mechanisms of mutation-driven resistance that are selected for when P. aeruginosa is challenged with either ceftazidime or ceftazidime/avibactam. For this purpose, P. aeruginosa PA14 was submitted to experimental evolution in the absence of antibiotics and in the presence of increasing concentrations of ceftazidime or ceftazidime/avibactam for 30 consecutive days. Final populations were analysed by whole-genome sequencing. All evolved populations reached similar levels of ceftazidime resistance. Besides, all of them were more susceptible to amikacin and produced pyomelanin. A first event in the evolution was the selection of large chromosomal deletions containing hmgA (involved in pyomelanin production), galU (involved in {beta}-lactams resistance) and mexXY-oprM (involved in aminoglycoside resistance). Besides mutations in mpl and dacB that regulate {beta}-lactamase expression, mutations related to MexAB-OprM overexpression were prevalent. Ceftazidime/avibactam challenge selected mutants in the putative efflux pump PA14_45890-45910 and in a two-component system (PA14_45870-45880), likely regulating its expression. All populations produce pyomelanin and were more susceptible to aminoglycosides likely due to the selection of large chromosomal deletions. Since pyomelanin-producing mutants, presenting similar deletions are regularly isolated from infections, the potential aminoglycosides hyper-susceptiblity and reduced {beta}-lactams susceptibility of pyomelanin-producing P. aeruginosa should be taken into consideration for treating infections by these isolates.",

    "abstract": "Humans comprehend speech despite the various challenges of real-world environments, such as loud noise and mispronunciation. Our auditory system is robust to these thanks to the integration of the upcoming sensory input with prior knowledge and expectations built on language-specific regularities. One such regularity regards the permissible phoneme sequences, which determine the likelihood that a word belongs to a given language (phonotactic probability; \\\"blick\\\" is more likely to be an English word than \\\"bnick\\\"). Previous research suggested that violations of these rules modulate brain evoked responses such as the N400 and the late positive complex. Yet several fundamental questions remain unresolved, especially regarding the neural encoding and integration strategy of phonotactic information. Here, we used linear modelling approaches to assess the influence of phonotactic probabilities on the brain responses to narrative speech measured with non-invasive EEG. We found that the relationship between continuous speech and EEG responses is best described when the speech descriptor includes phonotactic probabilities. This provides us with a methodology to isolate and measure the brain responses to phonotactics using natural speech at the individual subject-level. Furthermore, such low-frequency signals showed the strongest speech-EEG interactions at latencies of 100-400 ms, supporting a pre-lexical role of phonotactic information.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSpeech is composed of basic units, called phonemes, whose combinations comply with language-specific regularities determining whether a sequence \\\"sounds\\\" as a plausible word. Our ability to detect irregular combinations requires matching incoming sequences with our internal expectations, a process that supports speech segmentation and learning. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not yet been established. Here, we examine this in the human brain using narrative speech. We identified a brain signal reflecting the likelihood that a word belongs to the language, which may offer new opportunities to investigate speech perception, learning, development, and impairment. Our data also suggest a pre-lexical role of this phenomenon, thus supporting and extending current mechanistic perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Foxp3+ regulatory T (TR) cells are phenotypically and functionally diverse, and broadly distributed in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. However, the pathways guiding the differentiation of tissue-resident TR populations have not been well defined. By regulating E-protein function, Id3 controls the differentiation of CD8+ effector T cells and is essential for TR maintenance and function. We show that dynamic expression of Id3 helps define three distinct TR populations, Id3+CD62LhiCD44lo central (c)TR, Id3+CD62LloCD44hi effector (e)TR and Id3- eTR. Adoptive transfer experiments and transcriptome analyses support a stepwise model of differentiation from Id3+ cTR to Id3+ eTR to Id3- eTR. Furthermore, Id3- eTR have high expression of functional inhibitory markers and a transcriptional signature of tissue-resident TR. Accordingl Id3- eTR are highly enriched in non-lymphoid organs, but virtually absent from blood and lymph Thus, we propose that tissue-resident TR develop in a multi-step process associated with Id3 downregulation.",

    "abstract": "Genomes of extremely thermophilic Caldicellulosiruptor species encode novel cellulose binding proteins, t[a]pirins, located proximate to the type IV pilus locus. Previously, the C-terminal domain of a t[a]pirin (Calkro_0844) from Caldicellulosiruptor kronotskyensis was shown to be structurally unique and have a cellulose binding affinity akin to family 3 carbohydrate binding modules (CBM3). Here, full-length and C-terminal versions of t[a]pirins from Caldicellulosiruptor bescii (Athe_1870), Caldicellulosiruptor hydrothermalis (Calhy_0908), Caldicellulosiruptor kristjanssonii (Calkr_0826), and Caldicellulosiruptor naganoensis (NA10_0869) were produced recombinantly in Escherichia coli and compared to Calkro_0844. All five t[a]pirins bound to microcrystalline cellulose, switchgrass, poplar, filter paper, but not to xylan. Densitometry analysis of bound protein fractions visualized by SDS-PAGE revealed that Calhy_0908 and Calkr_0826 (from weakly cellulolytic species) associated with the cellulose substrates to a greater extent than Athe_1870, Calkro_0844 and NA10_0869 (from strongly cellulolytic species), perhaps to associate closely with biomass to capture glucans released from lignocellulose by cellulases produced in Caldicellulosiruptor communities. Three-dimensional structures of the C-terminal binding regions of Calhy_0908 and Calkr_0826 were closely related to Calkro_0844, despite the fact that their amino acid sequence identities compared to Calkro_0844 were only 16% and 36%, respectively. Unlike the parent strain, C. bescii mutants lacking the t[a]pirin genes did not bind to cellulose following short-term incubation, reinforcing the significance of these proteins in cell association with plant biomass. Given the scarcity of carbohydrates in neutral terrestrial hot springs, t[a]pirins likely help cells scavenge carbohydrates from lignocellulose to support growth and survival of Caldicellulosiruptor species.\\n\\nImportanceMechanisms by which microorganisms attach to and degrade lignocellulose are important to understand if effective approaches for conversion of plant biomass into fuels and chemicals are to be developed. Caldicellulosiruptor species grow on carbohydrates from lignocellulose at elevated temperatures and have biotechnological significance for that reason. Novel cellulose binding proteins, called t[a]pirins, are involved in the way Caldicellulosiruptor species interact with microcrystalline cellulose and here additional information about the diversity of these proteins across the genus is provided, including three dimensional structural comparisons.",

In this study, the potential of white rot fungi Dichomitus squalens for enhancing laccase production during interaction with two other white rot fungi Trametes versicolor or Pleurotus ostreatus was identified. To probe the mechanism of laccase induction and the role of laccase played during the combative interaction, we analyzed the laccase induction response to stressful conditions during fungal interaction related to the differential gene expression profile. We further confirmed the expression patterns of 16 selected genes by qRT-PCR analysis. We noted that many differential expression genes (DEGs) encoding proteins were involved in xenobiotics detoxification and ROS generation or reduction, including aldo/keto reductase, glutathione S-transferases, cytochrome P450 enzymes, alcohol oxidases and dehydrogenase, manganese peroxidase and laccase. Furthermore, many DEG-encoding proteins were involved in antagonistic mechanisms of nutrient acquisition and antifungal properties, including glycoside hydrolase, glucanase, chitinase and terpenoid synthases. DEGs analysis effectively revealed that laccase induction was likely caused by protective responses to oxidative stress and nutrient competition during fungal interspecific interaction.",

Imported MAYV cases are on the rise, leading to invasion concerns similar to Chikungunya and Zika viruses. Little is known about the range of mosquito species that are competent MAYV vectors. We tested vector competence of 2 MAYV genotypes for six mosquito species (Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, An. stephensi, An. quadrimaculatus, An. freeborni, Culex quinquefasciatus). Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus were poor MAYV vectors, and either were poorly infected or poorly transmitted. In contrast, all Anopheles species were able to transmit MAYV, and 3 of the 4 species transmitted both genotypes. The Anopheles species tested are divergent and native to widely separated geographic regions, suggesting that Anopheles may be important in the invasion and spread of MAYV across diverse regions of the world.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral changes due to the development of symptoms have been studied in mono-infections. However, in reality, multiple infections are circulating within the same time period and behavioral changes resulting from contraction of one of the diseases affect the dynamics of the other.\\n\\nThe present study aims at assessing the effect of home isolation on the joint dynamics of two infectious diseases, including co-infection, assuming that the two diseases do not confer cross-immunity. We use an age- and time- structured co-infection model based on partial differential equations. Social contact matrices, describing different mixing patterns of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals are incorporated into the calculation of the age- and time-specific marginal forces of infection.\\n\\nTwo scenarios are simulated, assuming that one of the diseases has more severe symptoms than the other. In the first scenario, people stay only at home when having symptoms of the most severe disease. In the second scenario, twice as many people stay at home when having symptoms of the most severe disease than when having symptoms of the other disease.\\n\\nThe results show that the impact of home isolation on the joint dynamics of two infectious diseases depends on the epidemiological parameters and properties of the diseases (e.g., basic reproduction number, symptom severity). In case both diseases have a low to moderate basic reproduction number, and there is no home isolation for the less severe disease, the final size of the less severe disease increases with the proportion of symptomatic cases of the most severe disease staying at home, after an initial decrease. When twice as many people stay at home when having symptoms of the most severe disease than when having symptoms of the other disease, increasing the proportion staying at home always reduces the final size of both diseases, and the number of co-infections.\\n\\nIn conclusion, when providing advise if people should stay at home in the context of two or more co-circulating diseases, one has to take into account epidemiological parameters and symptom severity.",

While studies have focused on associations between the microbiome and single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes, their copy number (CN) can also vary. Here, in a study of human subjects including a 2-week standard diet, we relate oral and gut microbiome to CN at the AMY1 locus, which encodes the gene for salivary amylase, active in starch degradation. We show that although diet standardization drove gut microbiome convergence, AMY1-CN influenced oral and gut microbiome composition and function. The gut microbiomes of low-AMY1-CN subjects had an enhanced capacity for breakdown of complex carbohydrates. Those of high-AMY1 subjects were enriched in microbiota linked to resistant starch fermentation, had higher fecal SCFAs, and drove higher adiposity when transferred to germfree mice. Gut microbiota results were validated in a larger separate population. This study establishes AMY1-CN as a genetic factor patterning microbiome composition and function.",

These genes encode novel proteins as well as highly conserved proteins involved in processes including gene expression, cytoskeletal regulation, vesicular movement, and transmembrane transport. In addition, two genes act as suppressors on a pathway of conserved genes whose products mediate vesicle movement from early to recycling endosomes.

The blue (shortwavelength/S), green (medium-wavelength/M) and red (long-wavelength/L) cone photoreceptors of the human retina enable high-acuity daytime vision and trichromatic color perception. Cone subtypes are specified in a poorly understood two-step process, with a first decision between S and L/M fates, followed by a decision between L and M fates. To determine the mechanism controlling S vs. L/M fates, we studied the differentiation of human retinal organoids. We found that human organoids and retinas have similar distributions, gene expression profiles, and morphologies of cone subtypes. We found that S cones are specified first, followed by L/M cones, and that thyroid hormone signaling is necessary and sufficient for this temporal switch. Temporally dynamic expression of thyroid hormone degrading and activating proteins supports a model in which the retina itself controls thyroid hormone levels, ensuring low signaling early to specify S cones and high signaling late to produce L/M cones.

Hematological parameters, serum protein electrophoresis parameters and hepatic transaminases level (SGOT-SGPT) were all measured in both control group rats (N=6) and diabetic group rats (N=6) and comparison between two groups was performed.\\n\\nMaterial and MethodSingle dose intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg dose of streptozotocin(STZ) in male adult wistar rats, induces extensive necrosis in langerhans {beta}-cell islets, because of its cytotoxicity. Experimental diabetes mellitus can be induced completely in less than 72 hours after STZ intraperitoneal injection. Streptozotocin(STZ) was purchased from Sigma company. Diabetic and control group rats were kept separately in different metabolic cages, and their blood glucose(BG), hematological parameters, serum protein electrophoretic pattern and hepatic transaminases level were analyzed and comparison was done.\\n\\nResultsIn our investigation, Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus(IDDM) was completely induced one week after single intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg BW. Diabetes mellitus induction was verified by measuring fasting plasma glucose level in blood samples of rats. Level of blood glucose, hematological parameters, serum protein electrophoretic pattern and hepatic transaminase enzymes level, were all measured. In diabetic group rats level of blood glucose (BG), hepatic transaminase enzymes (SGOT & SGPT), serum 1-globulin and {beta}-globulin were significantly increased but in albumin, albumin/globulin ratio (A/G ratio) and serum 2-globulin a significant decrease was observed in diabetic rats in comparison with normal rats.\\n\\nConclusionExtensive inflammation and tissue necrosis induced following diabetes mellitus induction in rats. Significant alterations were observed in serum protein electrophoresis fractions and hepatic transaminase enzymes level due to streptozotocin cytotoxic impacts on some tissues specifically liver.\\n\\nBecause of extensive {beta}-cells necrosis and degeneration caused by streptozotocin exposure, high level of blood glucose(diabetic hyperglycemia) was observed in diabetic rats. This type of experimentally induced diabetes mellitus would highly affect hematological parameters. Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus induced by streptozotocin, can lead to anemia, neutrophilia and lymphocytosis and also has decreasing effects on red blood cell indices (HGB, MCV, MCH, MCHC) in diabetic group rats.",

    "abstract": "MotivationRelief is a family of machine learning algorithms that uses nearest-neighbors to select features whose association with an outcome may be due to epistasis or statistical interactions with other features in high-dimensional data. Relief-based estimators are non-parametric in the statistical sense that they do not have a parameterized model with an underlying probability distribution for the estimator, making it difficult to determine the statistical significance of Relief-based attribute estimates. Thus, a statistical inferential formalism is needed to avoid imposing arbitrary thresholds to select the most important features.\\n\\nMethodsWe reconceptualize the Relief-based feature selection algorithm to create a new family of STatistical Inference Relief (STIR) estimators that retains the ability to identify interactions while incorporating sample variance of the nearest neighbor distances into the attribute importance estimation. This variance permits the calculation of statistical significance of features and adjustment for multiple testing of Relief-based scores. Specifically, we develop a pseudo t-test version of Relief-based algorithms for case-control data.\\n\\nResultsWe demonstrate the statistical power and control of type I error of the STIR family of feature selection methods on a panel of simulated data that exhibits properties reflected in real gene expression data, including main effects and network interaction effects. We compare the performance of STIR when the adaptive radius method is used as the nearest neighbor constructor with STIR when thefixed-k nearest neighbor constructor is used. We apply STIR to real RNA-Seq data from a study of major depressive disorder and discuss STIRs straightforward extension to genome-wide association studies.\\n\\nAvailabilityCode and data available at http://insilico.utulsa.edu/software/STIR.\\n\\nContactbrett.mckinney@gmail.com",

    "abstract": "How membrane proteins distribute and behave on the surface of cells is determined by the molecules interaction potential. However, measuring this potential, and how it varies with protein-to-protein distance, has been challenging. We here present how a method we call hydrodynamic trapping can achieve this. Our method uses the focused liquid flow from a micropipette to locally accumulate molecules protruding from a lipid membrane. The interaction potential, as well as information about the dimensions of the studied molecule, are obtained by relating the degree of accumulation to the strength of the trap. We have used this to study four representative proteins, with different height-to-width ratios and protein properties; from the globular streptavidin, to the rod-like immune cell proteins CD2, CD4 and CD45. The obtained data illustrates how protein shape, glycosylation and flexibility influence the behaviour of membrane proteins as well as underline the general applicability of the method.",

    "abstract": "The Caenorhabditis elegans Gene Knockout (KO) Consortium is tasked with obtaining null mutations in each of the more than 20,000 open reading frames (ORFs) of this organism. To date, approximately15,000 ORFs have associated putative null alleles. A directed approach using CRISPR/Cas9 methodology is the most promising technique to complete the task. While there has been substantial success in using CRISPR/Cas9 in C. elegans, there has been little emphasis on optimizing the method for generating large insertions/deletions in this organism. To enhance the efficiency of using CRISPR/Cas9 to generate gene knockouts in C. elegans we have developed an online species-specific guide RNA selection tool (http://genome.sfu.ca/crispr). When coupled with previously developed selection vectors, optimization for homology arm length, and the use of purified Cas9 protein, we demonstrate a robust, efficient and effective protocol for generating deletions. Debate and speculation in the larger scientific community about off- target effects due to non-specific Cas9 cutting has prompted us to investigate through whole genome sequencing the occurrence of single nucleotide variants and indels accompanying targeted deletions. We did not detect any off-site variants above the natural spontaneous mutation rate and therefore conclude this modified protocol does not generate off-target events to any significant degree in C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is a predominant cause of disability worldwide, with thrombolytic or mechanical removal of the occlusion being the only therapeutic options. Reperfusion bears the risk of an acute deleterious calcium-dependent breakdown of the blood-brain-barrier. Its mechanism, however, is unknown. Here we identify type 5 NADPH oxidase (NOX5), a calcium-activated, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-forming enzyme as missing link. Using a humanised knock-in mouse model and in vitro in organotypic cultures, we find re-oxygenation or calcium overload to increase brain ROS levels in a NOX5-dependent manner. In vivo, post-ischemic ROS formation, infarct volume and functional outcomes were worsened in NOX5 knock-in mice. Of clinical and therapeutic relevance, in a human blood-barrier model pharmacological NOX inhibition also prevented acute re-oxygenation induced leakage. Our data therefore identify NOX5 as sufficient to induce acute post-reperfusion calcium-dependent blood-brain-barrier breakdown. We suggest urgent clinical validation by conducting protective post-stroke re-canalisation in the presence of a NOX inhibitor.",

    "abstract": "Meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies have not found a clear relationship between the orbitofrontal cortex and obesity, despite animal and human studies suggesting the contrary. Our primary meta-analysis examined what regions are associated with reduced gray matter volume, given increased body mass index. We identified 23 voxel-based morphometry studies examining the association between gray matter volume and body mass index. In a sample of 6,788 participants, we found that greater body mass index is associated with decreased gray matter volume in the right Brodmanns area 10 and 11, forming part of the right orbitofrontal cortex (FWE, p=0.05). Use of Brodmanns areas 10 and 11 as seeds in a Neurosynth network coactivation and text decoding analysis revealed that these regions are associated with studies of emotional regulation and processing, clinical symptoms and disorder,  mentalizing and social cognition, and the Default mode network. Our finding uniquely contributes to the literature in showing a relationship between the orbitofrontal cortex and obesity and showing the wide-ranging impact these differences may have on social, mental, and emotional functioning as well as on the Default mode network. Exploratory analyses suggest the need for studies examining the effect of age on these findings.",

    "abstract": "A series of experiments investigated potential changes in temporal processing during the months following activation of a cochlear implant (CI) and as a function of stimulus level. Experiment 1 tested patients on the day of implant activation and two and six months later. All stimuli were presented using direct stimulation of a single apical electrode. The dependent variables were rate discrimination ratios (RDRs) for pulse trains with rates centred on 120 pulses per second (pps), obtained using an adaptive procedure, and a measure of the upper limit of temporal pitch, obtained using a pitch-ranking procedure.\\n\\nAll stimuli were presented at their most comfortable level (MCL). RDRs decreased from 1.23 to 1.16 and the upper limit increased from 357 to 485 pps from 0 to 2 months post-activation, with no overall change from 2 to 6 months. Because MCLs and hence the testing level increased across sessions, two further experiments investigated whether the performance changes observed across sessions could be due to level differences. Experiment 2 re-tested a subset of subjects at 9 months post-activation, using current levels similar to those used at 0 months. Although the stimuli sounded softer, some subjects showed lower RDRs and/or higher upper limits at this re-test. Experiment 3 measured RDRs and the upper limit for a separate group of subjects at levels equal to 60%, 80%, and 100% of the dynamic range. RDRs decreased with increasing level. The upper limit increased with increasing level for most subjects, with two notable exceptions. Implications of the results for temporal plasticity are discussed, along with possible influences of the effects of level and of across-session learning.",

    "abstract": "We find, unexpectedly, that C. elegans neurons can encode information through regenerative all-or-none action potentials. In a survey of current-voltage relationships in C. elegans neurons, we discovered that AWA olfactory neurons generate membrane potential spikes with defining characteristics of action potentials. Ion substitution experiments, pharmacology, and mutant analysis identified a voltage-gated CaV1 calcium channel and a Shaker-type potassium channel that underlie action potential dynamics in AWA. Simultaneous patch-clamp recording and calcium imaging in AWA revealed spike-associated calcium signals that were also observed after odor stimulation of intact animals, suggesting that natural odor stimuli induce AWA action potentials. The stimulus regimes that elicited action potentials match AWAs proposed specialized function in climbing odor gradients. Our results provide evidence that C. elegans can use digital as well as analog coding schemes, expand the computational repertoire of its nervous system, and inform future modeling of its neural coding and network dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Body fat distribution is a heritable risk factor for a range of adverse health consequences, including hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes. To identify protein-coding variants associated with body fat distribution, assessed by waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index, we analyzed 228,985 predicted coding and splice site variants available on exome arrays in up to 344,369 individuals from five major ancestries for discovery and 132,177 independent European-ancestry individuals for validation. We identified 15 common (minor allele frequency, MAF[&ge;]5%) and 9 low frequency or rare (MAF<5%) coding variants that have not been reported previously. Pathway/gene set enrichment analyses of all associated variants highlight lipid particle, adiponectin level, abnormal white adipose tissue physiology, and bone development and morphology as processes affecting fat distribution and body shape. Furthermore, the cross-trait associations and the analyses of variant and gene function highlight a strong connection to lipids, cardiovascular traits, and type 2 diabetes. In functional follow-up analyses, specifically in Drosophila RNAi-knockdown crosses, we observed a significant increase in the total body triglyceride levels for two genes (DNAH10 and PLXND1). By examining variants often poorly tagged or entirely missed by genome-wide association studies, we implicate novel genes in fat distribution, stressing the importance of interrogating low-frequency and protein-coding variants.",
