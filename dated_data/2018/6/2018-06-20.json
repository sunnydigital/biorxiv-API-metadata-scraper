    "abstract": "Hedgehog protein signals mediate tissue patterning and maintenance via binding to and inactivation of their common receptor Patched, a twelve-transmembrane protein that otherwise would suppress activity of the seven-transmembrane protein, Smoothened. Loss of Patched function, the most common cause of basal cell carcinoma, permits unregulated activation of Smoothened and of the Hedgehog pathway. A cryo-EM structure of the Patched protein reveals striking transmembrane domain similarities to prokaryotic RND transporters. The extracellular domain mediates association of Patched monomers in an unusual dimeric architecture that implies curvature in the associated membrane. A central conduit with cholesterol-like contents courses through the extracellular domain and resembles that used by other RND proteins to transport substrates, suggesting Patched activity in cholesterol transport. Patched expression indeed reduces cholesterol activity in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, in a manner antagonized by Hedgehog stimulation and with implications for regulation of Smoothened.",

    "abstract": "Transition path sampling techniques allow molecular dynamics simulations of complex systems to focuson rare dynamical events, providing insight into mechanisms and the ability to calculate rates inaccessibleby ordinary dynamics simulations. While path sampling algorithms are conceptually as simple as importancesampling Monte Carlo, the technical complexity of their implementation has kept these techniquesout of reach of the broad community. Here, we introduce an easy-to-use Python framework called Open-PathSampling (OPS) that facilitates path sampling for (bio)molecular systems with minimal effort and yetis still extensible. Interfaces to OpenMM and an internal dynamics engine for simple models are providedin the initial release, but new molecular simulation packages can easily be added. Multiple ready-to-usetransition path sampling methodologies are implemented, including standard transition path sampling (TPS)between reactant and product states, transition interface sampling (TIS) and its replica exchange variant(RETIS), as well as recent multistate and multiset extensions of transition interface sampling (MSTIS, MISTIS).In addition, tools are provided to facilitate the implementation of new path sampling schemes built on basicpath sampling components. In this paper, we give an overview of the design of this framework and illustratethe simplicity of applying the available path sampling algorithms to a variety of benchmark problems.",

However, the impact of a stem cell-like tumor phenotype (\\\"sternness\\\") on the immunological properties of cancer has not been systematically explored. Using gene expression-based metrics, we evaluate the association of stemness with immune cell infiltration and genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical parameters across 21 solid cancers. We find pervasive negative associations between cancer stemness and anticancer immunity. This occurs despite high stemness cancers exhibiting increased mutation load, cancer-testis antigen expression, and intratumoral heterogeneity. Stemness was also strongly associated with cell-intrinsic suppression of endogenous retroviral expression and type I interferon signaling and increased expression of several therapeutically accessible signaling pathways. Thus, stemness is not only a fundamental process in cancer progression but may represent a unifying mechanism linking antigenicity, intratumoral heterogeneity, and immune suppression across cancers.",

Here we explore TP design space to address this question and to distill design rules. We exhaustively analyze 2- and 3-node biological candidate Turing systems: crucially, network structure alone neither determines nor guarantees emergent TPs. A surprisingly large fraction (>60%) of network design space can produce TPs, but these are sensitive to even subtle changes in parameters, network structure and regulatory mechanisms. This implies that TP networks are more common than previously thought, and evolution might regularly encounter prototypic solutions. Importantly, we deduce compositional rules for TP systems that are almost necessary and sufficient (96% of TP networks contain them, and 95% of networks implementing them produce TPs). This comprehensive network atlas provides the blueprints for identifying natural TPs, and for engineering synthetic systems.",

    "abstract": "Changes in land use generate trade-offs in the delivery of ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. However, we know little about how the stability of ecosystem services responds to landscape composition, and what ecological mechanisms underlie these trade-offs. Here, we develop a model to investigate the dynamics of three ecosystem services in intensively-managed agroecosystems, i.e. pollination-independent crop yield, crop pollination, and biodiversity. Our model reveals trade-offs and synergies imposed by landscape composition that affect not only the magnitude but also the stability of ecosystem service delivery. Trade-offs involving crop pollination are strongly affected by the degree to which crops depend on pollination and by their relative requirement for pollinator densities. We show conditions for crop production to increase with biodiversity and decreasing crop area, reconciling farmers profitability and biodiversity conservation. Our results further suggest that, for pollination-dependent crops, management strategies that focus on maximising yield will often overlook its stability. Given that agriculture has become more pollination-dependent over time, it is essential to understand the mechanisms driving these trade-offs to ensure food security.",

    "abstract": "The ability of interlocus sexual conflict to facilitate reproductive isolation is widely anticipated. However, very few experimental evolutionary studies have convincingly demonstrated the evolution of reproductive isolation due to sexual conflict. Recently a study on replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster under differential sexual conflict found that divergent mate preference evolved among replicate populations under high sexual conflict regime. The precopulatory isolating mechanism underlying such divergent mate preference could be sexual signals such as cuticular hydrocarbons since they evolve rapidly and are involved in D. melanogaster mate recognition. Using D. melanogaster replicates used in the previous study, we investigate whether cuticular hydrocarbon divergence bears signatures of sexually antagonistic coevolution that led to reproductive isolation among replicates of high sexual conflict regime. We found that D. melanogaster cuticular hydrocarbon profiles are sexually dimorphic. Although replicate populations under high sexual conflict displayed assortative mating, we found no significant differences in the cuticular hydrocarbon profile between the high and low sexual conflict regimes. Instead we find cuticular hydrocarbon divergence patterns to be suggestive of the Buridans Ass regime which is one of the six possible mechanisms to resolve sexual conflict. Sexual selection that co-vary between populations under high and low sexual conflict regimes may also have contributed to the evolution of cuticular hydrocarbons. This study indicates that population differentiation as a result of cuticular hydrocarbon divergence cannot be credited to sexual conflict despite high sexual conflict regime evolving divergent cuticular hydrocarbon profiles.",

    "abstract": "Genetic covariances represent a combination of pleiotropy and linkage disequilibrium, shaped by the populations history. Observed genetic covariance is most often interpreted in pleiotropic terms. In particular, functional constraints restricting which phenotypes are physically possible can lead to a stable G matrix with high genetic variance in fitness-associated traits and high pleiotropic negative covariance along the phenotypic curve of constraint. In contrast, population genetic models of relative fitness assume endless adaptation without constraint, through a series of selective sweeps that are well described by recent traveling wave models. We describe the implications of such population genetic models for the G matrix when pleiotropy is excluded by design, such that all covariance comes from linkage disequilibrium. The G matrix is far less stable than has previously been found, fluctuating over the timescale of selective sweeps. However, its orientation is relatively stable, corresponding to high genetic variance in fitness-associated traits and strong negative covariance - the same pattern often interpreted in terms of pleiotropic constraints but caused instead by linkage disequilibrium. We find that different mechanisms drive the instabilities along versus perpendicular to the fitness gradient. The origin of linkage disequilibrium is not drift, but small amounts of linkage disequilibrium are instead introduced by mutation and then amplified during competing selective sweeps. This illustrates the need to integrate a broader range of population genetic phenomena into quantitative genetics.",

We further show that X chromosomes exhibit a higher ratio of deletion/insertion when compared to autosomes. This simple pattern shows that the recent report that non-dividing quiescent yeast cells accumulate relatively more indels (and particularly deletions) than replicating ones also applies to metazoan cells, including humans. Indeed, the X chromosomes display more indels than the autosomes, having spent more time in quiescent oocytes, whereas the Y chromosomes are solely present in the replicating spermatocytes. From the proportion of indels, we have inferred that de novo mutations arising in the maternal lineage are twice more likely to be indels than mutations from the paternal lineage. Our observation, consistent with a recent trio analysis of the spectrum of mutations inherited from the maternal lineage, is likely a major component in our understanding of the origin of anisogamy.",

Using results from population genetics models, numerical predictions of the genetic load, inbreeding depression and heterosis were obtained for a broad range of selection coefficients and mutation rates. The models allowed for the possibility of very high mutation rates per nucleotide site, as is sometimes observed for epiallelic mutations. There was fairly good quantitative agreement between the theoretical predictions and empirical estimates of heterosis and the effects of population size on genetic load, on the assumption that the deleterious mutation rate per individual per generation is approximately one, but there was less good agreement for inbreeding depression. Weak selection, of the order of magnitude suggested by population genomic analyses, is required to explain the observed patterns. Possible caveats concerning the applicability of the models are discussed.",

We hypothesize that the application of antibiotics to suppress the reproduction of parasites can provide opportunity for the hosts to escape such winnerless coevolution. Here, we formulate a minimal mathematical model of host-parasite interaction involving multiple host phenotypes that are targeted by adapting parasites. Our model predicts the levels of antibiotic effectiveness that can steer the parasite-driven cyclic switching of host phenotypes (heteroclinic oscillations) to a stable equilibrium of host survival. Our simulations show that uninterrupted application of antibiotic with high-level effectiveness (> 85%) is needed to escape the Red Queen dynamics. Intermittent and low level of antibiotic effectiveness are indeed useless to stop host-parasite coevolution. This study can be a guide in designing good practices and protocols to minimize risk of further progression of parasitic infections.",

Throughout North America, we identified large inter-individual variation and discrete linkage blocks within and between chromosomes with known rearrangements: Ssa01/Ssa23 translocation and Ssa08/Ssa29 fusion. Spatial genetic analyses suggest independence of rearrangements, with Ssa01/Ssa23 showing high European introgression (>50%) in northern populations indicative of post-glacial trans-Atlantic secondary contact, contrasting low European ancestry genome-wide (3%). Ssa08/Ssa29 showed greater intra-population diversity suggesting a derived chromosome fusion polymorphism within North America. Evidence of selection on both regions suggests adaptive variation associated with karyotypes.

Here, we analyzed 1243 longitudinally-acquired structural MRI scans from 623 youth to investigate the relation between SES and cortical and subcortical morphology between ages 5 and 25 years. We found positive associations between SES and total volumes of the brain, cortical sheet, and four separate subcortical structures. These associations were developmentally fixed rather than age-dependent. Surface-based shape analysis revealed that higher SES is associated with areal expansion of (i) lateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, lateral temporal, and superior parietal cortices and (ii) ventrolateral thalamic, and medial amygdalo-hippocampal sub-regions. Meta-analyses of functional imaging data indicate that cortical correlates of SES are centered on brain systems subserving sensorimotor functions, language, memory, and emotional processing. We further show that anatomical variation within a subset of these cortical regions partially mediates the positive association between SES and IQ.

    "abstract": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) holds great promise for illuminating the biological changes that underpin cognitive development. The diffusion of water molecules probes the cellular structure of brain tissue, and biophysical modeling of the diffusion signal can be used to make inferences about specific tissue properties that vary over development or predict cognitive performance. However, applying these models to study development requires that the parameters can be reliably estimated given the constraints of data collection with children. Here we collect repeated scans using a multi-shell diffusion MRI protocol in a group of children (ages 7-12) and use two popular biophysical models to characterize axonal properties. We first assess the scan-rescan reliability of model parameters and show that axon water faction can be reliably estimated from a relatively fast acquisition, without applying spatial smoothing or de-noising. We then investigate developmental changes in the white matter, and individual differences in white matter that correlate with reading skill. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that previously reported correlations between reading skill and diffusion anisotropy in the corpus callosum reflect increased axon density in poor readers. Both models support this interpretation, highlighting the utility of biophysical models for testing specific hypotheses about cognitive development.",

    "abstract": "Predictive coding models propose that predictions (stimulus likelihood) reduce sensory signals as early as primary visual cortex (V1), and that attention (stimulus relevance) can modulate these effects. Indeed, both prediction and attention have been shown to modulate V1 activity, albeit with fMRI, which has low temporal resolution. This leaves it unclear whether these effects reflect a modulation of the first feedforward sweep of visual information processing and/or later, feedback-related activity. In two experiments, we used EEG and orthogonally manipulated spatial predictions and attention to address this issue. Although clear top-down biases were found, as reflected in pre-stimulus alpha-band activity, we found no evidence for top-down effects on the earliest visual cortical processing stage (<80ms post-stimulus), as indexed by the amplitude of the C1 ERP component and multivariate pattern analyses. These findings indicate that initial visual afferent activity may be impenetrable to top-down influences by spatial prediction and attention.",

In the current fMRI experiment, we used repetition suppression to test the hypothesis that populations of neurons in face perception and theory-of-mind neural networks would show sensitivity to faces that cue distinct trait judgments. Although faces were accurately discriminated based on associated traits, our results showed no evidence that face or theory-of-mind networks showed repetition suppression for face traits. Thus, we do not provide evidence for population coding models of face perception that include sensitivity to high and low trait features. Due to aspects of the experimental design, which bolstered statistical power and sensitivity, we have reasonable confidence that we could detect effects of a moderate size, should they exist. The null findings reported here, therefore, add value to models of neural organisation in social perception by showing instances where effects are absent or small. To test the generalisability of our findings, future work should test different types of trait judgment and different types of facial stimuli, in order to further probe the neurobiological bases of impression formation based on facial appearance.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive saccades benefit memory when executed before retrieval, with greatest effects for episodic memory in consistent-handers. Questions remain including how saccades affect scene memory, an important visual component of episodic memory. The present study tested how repetitive saccades affect working and recognition memory for novel scenes. Handedness direction (left-right) and degree (strong/consistent vs. mixed/inconsistent) was measured by raw and absolute laterality quotients respectively from an 8-question handedness inventory completed by 111 adults. Each then performed either 30 seconds of repetitive horizontal saccades or fixation before or after tasks of scene working memory and scene recognition. Regression with criterion variables of overall percent correct accuracy and d-prime sensitivity showed that when saccades were made before working memory, there was better overall accuracy as a function of increased direction but not degree of handedness. Subjects who made saccades before working memory also performed worse during subsequent recognition memory, while subjects who fixated or made saccades after the working memory task performed better. Saccades made before recognition resulted in recognition accuracy that was better (Cohens d=0.3729), but not significantly different from fixation before recognition. The results demonstrate saccades and handedness interact to affect scene memory with larger effects on encoding than recognition. Saccades before scene encoding in working memory are detrimental to short- and long-term memory, especially for those who are not consistently right-handed, while saccade execution before scene recognition does not appear to benefit recognition accuracy. The findings are discussed with respect to theories of interhemispheric interaction and control of visuospatial attention.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be used to directly affect neural activity from outside of the skull. However, its exact physiological mechanisms remain elusive, particularly when applied to new brain areas. The frontal eye field (FEF) has rarely been targeted with tDCS, even though it plays a crucial role in control of overt and covert spatial attention. Here we investigate whether tDCS over the FEF can affect the latency and accuracy of saccadic eye movements. 26 participants performed a prosaccade task in which they made eye movements to a sudden-onset eccentric visual target (lateral saccades). After each lateral saccade, they made an eye movement back to the center (center saccades). The task was administered before, during and after anodal or cathodal tDCS over the FEF, in a randomized, double-blind, within-subject design. One previous study (Kanai et al., 2012) found that anodal tDCS over the FEF decreased the latency of saccades contralateral to the stimulated hemisphere. We did not find the same effect: neither anodal nor cathodal tDCS influenced the latency of lateral saccades. tDCS also did not affect accuracy of lateral saccades (saccade endpoint deviation and saccade endpoint variability). For center saccades, we found some differences between the anodal and cathodal sessions, but these were not consistent across analyses (latency, endpoint variability), or were already present before tDCS onset (endpoint deviation). We tried to improve on the design of Kanai et al. (2012) in several ways, including the tDCS duration and electrode montage, which could explain the discrepant results. Our findings add to a growing number of null results, which have sparked concerns that tDCS outcomes are highly variable. Future studies should aim to establish the boundary conditions for frontal eye field tDCS to be effective, in addition to increasing sample size and adding additional controls such as a sham condition. At present, we conclude that it is unclear whether eye movements or other aspects of spatial attention can be affected through tDCS of the frontal eye fields.",

We explore here whether a very high-risk MCI subgroup can be identified using cognitive assessments and structural neuroimaging. A multimodal signature of Alzheimers dementia was first extracted using machine learning tools in the ADNI1 sample, and was comprised of cognitive deficits across multiple domains as well as atrophy in temporal, parietal and occipital regions. We then validated the predictive value of this signature on two MCI cohorts. In ADNI1 (N=235), the presence of the signature predicted progression to dementia over three years with 80.4% positive predictive value, adjusted for a \\\"typical\\\" MCI baseline rate of 33% (95.6% specificity, 55.1% sensitivity). These results were replicated in ADNI2 (N=235), with 87.8% adjusted positive predictive value (96.7% specificity, 47.3% sensitivity). Our results demonstrate that, even for widely used markers, marked improvement in positive predictive value over the literature can be achieved by focusing on a subgroup of individuals with similar brain characteristics.

In humans, sorbitol elevation is associated with complications of diabetes. Here we demonstrate that venom also induces this disease-relevant phenotype in human cells, and investigate possible pathways involved. Key findings are that (a) low doses of Nasonia venom elevate sorbitol levels in human renal mesangial cells (HRMCs) without changing glucose or fructose levels; (b) venom is a much more potent inducer of sorbitol elevation than glucose; (c) low venom doses significantly alter expression of genes involved in sterol and alcohol metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and chemical/stimulus response; (d) although venom treatment does not alter expression of the key sorbitol pathway gene aldose reductase (AR); (e) venom elevates expression of a related gene implicated in diabetes complications (AKR1C3) as well as the fructose metabolic gene (GFPT2). Although elevated sorbitol is accepted as a major contributor to secondary complications of diabetes, the molecular mechanism of sorbitol regulation and its contribution to diabetes complications are not fully understood. Our findings suggest that genes other than AR could contribute to sorbitol regulation, and more broadly illustrate the potential of parasitoid venoms for medical application.",

Overexpression of the IMA sequence in Arabidopsis induced Fe uptake genes in roots, causing accumulation of Fe and manganese in all plant parts including seeds. Silencing of all eight IMA genes harbored by the Arabidopsis genome abolished Fe uptake and caused severe chlorosis; increasing the Fe supply or overexpressing IMA1 restored the wild-type phenotype.

    "abstract": "Iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) deficiencies are a global human health problem that may worsen by growth of crops at elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2). However, climate change will also involve higher temperature, but it is unclear how the combined effect of eCO2 and higher temperature will affect the nutritional quality of food crops. To begin to address this question, we grew soybean (Glycine max) in a Temperature by Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (T-FACE) experiment in 2014 and 2015 under ambient (400 mol mol-1) and elevated (600 mol mol-1) CO2 concentration and under ambient and elevated temperatures (+2.7 {degrees}C day and +3.4 {degrees}C at night). In our study, eCO2 significantly decreased Fe concentration in soybean seeds in both seasons (-8.7% and -7.7%) and Zn concentration in one season (-8.9%) while higher temperature (at ambient CO2 concentration) had the opposite effect. The combination of eCO2 with elevated temperature generally restored seed Fe and Zn concentrations to levels obtained under ambient CO2 and temperature conditions, suggesting that the potential threat to human nutrition by increasing CO2 concentration may not be realized. In general, seed Fe concentration was negatively correlated with yield suggesting inherent limitations to increasing seed Fe. In addition, we confirm our previous report that the concentration of seed storage products and several minerals varies with node position at which the seeds developed. Overall, these results demonstrate the complexity of predicting climate change effects on food security when various environmental parameters change in an interactive manner.",

Two E. coli knockout strains were constructed: one that blocked the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (gnd KO) and one that decoupled the TCA cycle from electron transport (sdhCDAB KO). Despite major perturbations in central metabolism, minimal growth rate changes were found in the two knockout strains. More surprisingly, many similarities were found in their initial transcriptomic states that could be traced to similarly perturbed metabolites despite the differences in the network location of the gene perturbations and concomitant rerouting of pathway fluxes around these perturbations. However, following ALE, distinct metabolomic and transcriptomic states were realized. These included divergent flux and gene expression profiles in the gnd and sdhCDAB KOs to overcome imbalances in NADPH production and nitrogen/sulfur assimilation, respectively, that were not obvious limitations of growth in the unevolved knockouts. Therefore, this work demonstrates that ALE provides a productive approach to reveal novel insights of gene function at a systems level that cannot be found by observing the fresh knockout alone.",

Rapid, reproducible and adaptable analyses usually need substantial technical expertise but can yield valuable insight for infection management and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) teams. We describe a software application (RadaR - Rapid analysis of diagnostic and antimicrobial patterns in R) for infection management allowing user-friendly, intuitive and interactive analysis of large datasets without prior in-depth statistical or software knowledge.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsRadaR was built in R, an open source programming language, making it free to use and adaptable to different settings. Shiny, an additional open source package to implement web-application frameworks in R, was used to develop the application. RadaR was developed in the context of a 1339-bed academic tertiary referral hospital to handle data of more than 180,000 admissions.\\n\\nRadaR visualizes analytical graphs and statistical summaries in an interactive manner within seconds. Users can filter large patient groups by 17 different criteria and investigate antimicrobial use, microbiological diagnostic use and results, and outcome in length of stay. Results can easily be stratified and grouped to compare individually defined patient groups. Finally, datasets of identified patients / groups can be downloaded for further analyses.\\n\\nConclusionRadaR facilitates understanding and communication of trends in antimicrobial use, diagnostic use and patient outcome by linking and aggregating individual patient data in one user-friendly application. RadaR can produce aggregated data analysis while preserving patients features in the data to adjust and stratify results in detail. AMS teams can use RadaR to identify areas, both for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, within their institutions that might benefit from increased support and to target their interventions.",

Under novel representations of structurally-annotatedprotein sequences, a semi-supervised deep learning model that unifies recurrent and convolutional neural networks has been proposed to exploit both unlabeled and labeled data, for jointly encoding molecular representations and predicting affinities. Our representations and models outperform conventional options in achieving relative error in IC50 within 5-fold for test cases and 20-fold for protein classes not included for training. Performances for new protein classes with few labeled data are further improved by transfer learning. Furthermore, separate and joint attention mechanisms are developed and embedded to our model to add to its interpretability, as illustrated in case studies for predicting and explaining selective drug-target interactions. Lastly, alternative representations using protein sequences or compound graphs and a unified RNN/GCNN-CNN model using graph CNN (GCNN) are also explored to reveal algorithmic challenges ahead.\\n\\nAvailabilityData and source codes are available at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/DeepAffinity\\n\\nContactyshen@tamu.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at http://shen-lab.github.io/deep-affinity-bioinf18-supp-rev.pdf.",

    "abstract": "The OpenPathSampling (OPS) package provides an easy-to-use framework to apply transition path sampling methodologies to complex molecular systems with a minimum of effort. Yet, the extensibility of OPS allows for the exploration of new path sampling algorithms by building on a variety of basic operations. In a companion paper [Swenson et al 2018] we introduced the basic concepts and the structure of the OPS package, and how it can be employed to perform standard transition path sampling and (replica exchange) transition interface sampling. In this paper, we elaborate on two theoretical developments that went into the design of OPS. The first development relates to the construction of path ensembles, the what is being sampled. We introduce a novel set-based notation forthepath ensemble, which provides an alternative paradigm for constructing path ensembles, and allows building arbitrarily complex path ensembles from fundamental ones. The second fundamental development is the structure for the customisation of Monte Carlo procedures; how path ensembles are being sampled. We describe in detail the OPS objects that implement this approach to customization, the MoveScheme and the PathMover, and provide tools to create and manipulate these objects. We illustrate both the path ensemble building and sampling scheme customization with several examples. OPS thus facilitates both standard path sampling application in complex systems as well as the development of new path sampling methodology, beyond the default.",

    "abstract": "MotivationConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been trememdously successful in many contexts, particularly where training data is abundant and signal-to-noise ratios are large. However, when predicting noisily observed biological phenotypes from DNA sequence, each training instance is only weakly informative, and the amount of training data is often fundamentally limited, emphasizing the need for methods that make optimal use of training data and any structure inherent in the model.\\n\\nResultsHere we show how to combine equivariant networks, a general mathematical framework for handling exact symmetries in CNNs, with Bayesian dropout, a version of MC dropout suggested by a reinterpretation of dropout as a variational Bayesian approximation, to develop a model that exhibits exact reverse-complement symmetry and is more resistant to overtraining. We find that this model has increased power and generalizability, resulting in significantly better predictive accuracy compared to standard CNN implementations and state-of-art deep-learning-based motif finders. We use our network to predict recombination hotspots from sequence, and identify high-resolution binding motifs for the recombination-initiation protein PRDM9, which were recently validated by high-resolution assays. The network achieves a predictive accuracy comparable to that attainable by a direct assay of the H3K4me3 histone mark, a proxy for PRDM9 binding.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/luntergroup/EquivariantNetworks\\n\\nContactrichard.brown@well.ox.ac.uk, gerton.lunter@well.ox.ac.uk\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Upper respiratory tract pneumococcal carriage is important as both determinants of disease and population transmission. The immunological mechanisms that contain pneumococcal carriage are well-studied in mice but remain unclear in humans. Loss of this control of carriage following influenza infection is associated with secondary bacterial pneumonia during seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. We used a human type 6B pneumococcal challenge model to show that carriage acquisition induces early degranulation of resident neutrophils and recruitment of monocytes to the nose. Monocyte function associated with clearance of pneumococcal carriage. Prior nasal infection with live attenuated influenza virus induced inflammation, impaired innate function and altered genome-wide nasal gene responses to pneumococcal carriage.

Mouse vaccine and infection studies have defined CD4+ T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells in the resolution of infection and in effective protection. Patients with persistent Coccidioides infection demonstrate reduced cellular responses.\\n\\nMethodsPeripheral blood and serum were collected from 30 pediatric Coccidioides-infected patients and 20 healthy controls in the California San Joaquin Valley. Samples were evaluated by flow cytometry for innate and adaptive immune populations and cytokines to define the early immune response and identify clinically useful biomarkers for predicting disease outcome. Clinical and flow data were evaluated according to disease outcome (resolved or persistent) using principal component analysis, high-dimensional flow cytometry analysis tools, chi-square automatic interaction detection, and individual cell population comparisons.\\n\\nResultsPatients with persistent infection had lower Th17 and higher Treg frequencies, but similar Th1 responses, relative to patients that resolved disease. Treg frequency, eosinophil numbers and neutrophil numbers together distinguish patients that resolve infection from those that develop persistent infection.\\n\\nConclusionsThe inability to resolve Coccidioides infection may be a result of elevated Treg frequency and functional capacity, and Treg frequency may predict patient disease outcome at diagnosis. In our study, Th1 responses were similar in persistent and resolved infection, in contrast to prior human studies. Instead, our data suggest that Th17 cells provide an effective protection during Coccidioides infection, and that elevated Treg frequency inhibits protective immunity.",

To understand its physiology and interactions with co-existing bacterial species in different conditions, we established physiologically reproducible eighteen-species communities, and found that P. aeruginosa became the dominant species in mixed-species biofilm community but not in the planktonic community. P. aeruginosa H1 type VI secretion system was highly induced in the mixed-species biofilm community compare to its mono-species biofilm, which was further demonstrated to play a key role for P. aeruginosa to gain fitness over other bacterial species. In addition, the type IV pili and Psl exopolysaccharide were shown to be required for P. aeruginosa to compete with other bacterial species in the biofilm community. Our study showed that the physiology of P. aeruginosa is strongly affected by interspecies interactions, and both biofilm determinants and H1 type VI secretion system contribute to P. aeruginosa fitness over other species in complex biofilm communities.\\n\\nImportancePseudomonas aeruginosa usually coexists with different bacterial species in natural environment. However, systematic comparative characterization of P. aeruginosa in complex microbial communities with its mono-species communities is lacking. We constructed mixed-species planktonic and biofilm communities consisting P. aeruginosa and seventeen other bacterial species to study the physiology and interaction of P. aeruginosa in complex multiple-species community. A single molecule detection platform, NanoString nCounter(R) 16S rRNA array, was used to shown that P. aeruginosa can become the dominant species in the biofilm communities while not in the planktonic communities. Comparative transcriptomic analysis and fluorescence-based quantification further revealed that P. aeruginosa H1 type VI secretion system and biofilm determinants are both required for its fitness in mixed-species biofilm communities.",

In order to expand the range of questions which can be addressed with this tool however, new neurofeedback methods must be developed, going beyond feedback of activations in a single region. These new methods, several of which have already been proposed, are by their nature complex, involving many possible parameters. Here we suggest a framework for evaluating and optimizing algorithms for use in a real-time setting, before beginning the neurofeedback experiment, by offline simulations of algorithm output using a previously collected dataset. We demonstrate the application of this framework on the instantaneous proxy for correlations which we developed for training connectivity between different network nodes, identify the optimal parameters for use with this algorithm, and compare it to more traditional correlation methods. We also examine the effects of advanced imaging techniques, such as multi-echo acquisition, and the integration of these into the realtime processing stream.",

However, mechanistic insight into both the photophysical and intermolecular phenomena underlying their utility is lacking, resulting in obligate heuristic approaches for producing ssDNA-SWNT based technologies. In this work, we present an ultrasensitive \\\"turn-on\\\" nanosensor for neuromodulators dopamine and norepinephrine with strong {Delta}F/F0 of up to 3500%, a signal appropriate for in vivo imaging, and uncover the photophysical principles and intermolecular interactions that govern the molecular recognition and fluorescence modulation of this nanosensor synthesized from the non-covalent conjugation of (GT)6 ssDNA strands on SWNTs. The fluorescence modulation of the ssDNA-SWNT conjugate is shown to exhibit remarkable sensitivity to the ssDNA sequence chemistry, length, and surface density, providing a wealth of parameters with which to tune nanosensor dynamic range and strength of fluorescence turn-on. We employ classical and quantum mechanical molecular dynamics simulations to rationalize our experimental findings. Calculations show that (GT)6 ssDNA form ordered loops around SWNT, inducing periodic surface potentials that modulate exciton recombination lifetimes. Further evidence is presented to elucidate how analyte binding modulates SWNT fluorescence. We discuss the implications of our findings for SWNT-based molecular sensing applications.",

    "abstract": "The seemingly stable construct of our bodily self depends on the continued, successful integration of multisensory feedback about our body, rather than its purely physical composition. Accordingly, pathological disruption of such neural processing is linked to striking alterations of the bodily self, ranging from limb misidentification to disownership, and even the desire to amputate a healthy limb. While previous embodiment research has relied on experimental setups using supernumerary limbs in variants of the Rubber Hand Illusion, we here used Augmented Reality to directly manipulate the feeling of ownership for ones own, biological limb. Using a Head-Mounted Display, participants received visual feedback about their own arm, from an embodied first-person perspective. In a series of three studies, in independent cohorts, we altered embodiment by providing visuotactile feedback that could be synchronous (control condition) or asynchronous (400ms delay, Real Hand Illusion). During the illusion, participants reported a significant decrease in ownership of their own limb, along with a lowered sense of agency. Supporting the right-parietal body network, we found an increased illusion strength for the left upper limb as well as a modulation of the feeling of ownership during anodal transcranial direct current stimulation. Extending previous research, these findings demonstrate that a controlled, visuotactile conflict about ones own limb can be used to directly and systematically modulate ownership - without a proxy. This not only corroborates the malleability of body representation but questions its permanence. These findings warrant further exploration of combined VR and neuromodulation therapies for disorders of the bodily self.",

Here we hypothesized that patients with delirium show impairments in language formation, coherence and comprehension.\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nThis was a case-control study in 45 hospitalized patients (aged 65-97 years) with delirium, dementia without delirium, or no cognitive impairment (N=15 per group). DSM-5 criteria were used for delirium. Speech was elicited during (1) structured conversational questioning, and (2) the \\\"Cookie Theft\\\" picture description task. Language comprehension was assessed through standardized verbal and written commands. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nDelirium and dementia groups scored lower on the conversational assessment than the control group (p<0.01, moderate effect sizes (r) of 0.48 and 0.51, resp.). In the Cookie Theft task, the average length of utterances (i.e. unit of speech), indicating language productivity and fluency, distinguished patients with delirium from those with dementia (p<0.01, r=0.50) and no cognitive impairment (p<0.01, r=0.55). Patients with delirium performed worse on written comprehension tests compared to cognitively unimpaired patients (p<0.01, r=0.63), but not compared to the dementia group.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nProduction of spontaneous speech, word quantity, speech content and verbal and written language comprehension are impaired in delirious patients compared to cognitively unimpaired patients. Additionally, patients with delirium produced significantly less fluent speech than those with dementia. These findings have implications for how speech and language are evaluated in delirium assessments, and also for communication with patients with delirium.",

We undertook two pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers, using standard adult doses of artmether-lumefantrine (AL) or artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) given with 50mg once daily dolutegravir (DTG) to investigate the drug-drug interaction between artmether-lumefantrine or artesunate-amodiaquine and DTG. The DTG/artmether-lumefantrine interaction was evaluated in a two-way cross-over study and measured artemether (ARM), dihydroartemisinin (DHA), lumefantrine (LF), desbutyl-lumefantrine (DBL) over 264h. The DTG/artesunate-amodiaquine interaction was investigated using a parallel study design due to long half-life of the amodiaquine metabolite, desethylamodiaquine (DEAQ) and measured artesunate (ARS), amodiaquine (AQ), DEAQ over 624h. Non-compartmental analysis was performed, and geometric mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals generated for evaluation of both interactions. Dolutegravir did not significantly change the maximum concentration in plasma, time to maximum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for ARM, DHA, LF and DBL nor significantly alter AUC for ARS, DHA, AQ and DEAQ. Co-administration of dolutegravir with AL resulted in a 37% decrease in DTG trough concentrations. Co-administration of dolutegravir with AS-AQ resulted in a decrease of approximately 42% and 24% in DTG trough concentrations and AUC respectively. Study drugs were well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. Standard doses of artmether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine should be used in patients receiving DTG. The significant decreases in DTG trough concentrations with artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine and DTG exposure with artesunate-amodiaquine are unlikely to be of clinical significance as DTG trough concentrations were above DTG target concentrations of 64ng/mL.",

    "abstract": "Lactic-acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus plantarum are commonly used for fermenting foods and as probiotics, where increasingly sophisticated genome-editing tools are currently being employed to elucidate and enhance these microbes beneficial properties. The most advanced tools to-date require heterologous single-stranded DNA recombinases to integrate short oligonucleotides followed by using CRISPR-Cas9 to eliminate cells harboring unedited sequences. Here, we show that encoding the recombineering template on a replicating plasmid allowed efficient genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9 in multiple L. plantarum strains without a recombinase. This strategy accelerated the genome-editing pipeline and could efficiently introduce a stop codon in ribB, silent mutations in ackA, and a complete deletion of lacM. In contrast, oligo-mediated recombineering with CRISPR-Cas9 proved far less efficient in at least one instance. We also observed unexpected outcomes of our recombinase-free method, including an ~1.3-kb genomic deletion when targeting ribB in one strain, and reversion of a point mutation in the recombineering template in another strain. Our method therefore can streamline targeted genome editing in different strains of L. plantarum, although the best means of achieving efficient editing may vary based on the selected sequence modification, gene, and strain.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we examine the use of perturbation data to infer the underlying mechanistic dynamic model. The approach uses an evolutionary strategy to evolve networks based on a fitness criterion that measures the difference between the experimentally determined set of perturbation data and proposed mechanistic models. At present we only deal with reaction networks that use mass-action kinetics employing uni-uni, bi-uni, uni-bi and bi-bi reactions. The key to our approach is to split the algorithm into two phases. The first phase focuses on evolving network topologies that are consistent with the perturbation data followed by a second phase that evolves the parameter values. This results in almost an exact match between the evolved network and the original network from which the perturbation data was generated from. We test the approach on four models that include linear chain, feed-forward loop, cyclic pathway and a branched pathway. Currently the algorithm is implemented using Python and libRoadRunner but could at a later date be rewritten in a compiled language to improve performance. Future studies will focus on the impact of noise in the perturbation data on convergence and variability in the evolved parameter values and topologies. In addition we will investigate the effect of nonlinear rate laws on generating unique solutions.",

    "abstract": "Quality control of offspring is important for the survival of cells. However, the mechanism by which quality of offspring cells may be monitored while running genetic programs of cellular differentiation remains largely unclear. Here we investigated a quality control system during Bacillus subtilis spore formation by combining single-cell time-lapse microscopy, molecular biology and mathematical modelling. Our results revealed that the quality-control system via premature germination is coupled with the accumulation of cations on the surface of developing forespores. Specifically, the forespores accumulating less cations on their surface are more likely to be aborted. This charge accumulation system enables the projection of multidimensional information about the external environment and morphological development of the forespore onto a one-dimensional information of cation accumulation. Based on the insight we gain, we propose a novel use of Nernstian chemicals for reducing the yield and quality of Bacillus endospores.",

We used new methods for serial section electron microscopy to examine entire cells and their projections in mouse antral ovarian follicles. It is already known that cumulus cells send towards the oocyte thin cytoplasmic projections called transzonal projections (TZPs), which are crucial for normal oocyte development. We found that most TZPs do not reach the oocyte, and that they often branch and make gap junctions with each other. Furthermore, the connected TZPs are usually contacted on their shaft by oocyte microvilli. Mural granulosa cells were found to possess randomly oriented cytoplasmic projections that are strikingly similar to free-ended TZPs. We propose that granulosa cells use cytoplasmic projections to search for the oocyte, and cumulus cell differentiation results from a contact-mediated paracrine interaction with the oocyte.",

    "abstract": "Classifying and mapping vegetation are very important tasks in environmental science and natural resource management. However, these tasks are not easy because conventional methods such as field surveys are highly labor intensive. Automatic identification of target objects from visual data is one of the most promising ways to reduce the costs for vegetation mapping. Although deep learning has become a new solution for image recognition and classification recently, in general, detection of ambiguous objects such as vegetation still is considered difficult. In this paper, we investigated the potential for adapting the chopped picture method, a recently described protocol for deep learning, to detect plant communities in Google Earth images. We selected bamboo forests as the target. We obtained Google Earth images from three regions in Japan. By applying the deep convolutional neural network, the model successfully learned the features of bamboo forests in Google Earth images, and the best trained model correctly detected 97% of the targets. Our results show that identification accuracy strongly depends on the image resolution and the quality of training data. Our results also highlight that deep learning and the chopped picture method can potentially become a powerful tool for high accuracy automated detection and mapping of vegetation.",

    "abstract": "The ecological impacts of roads and railways extend into the surrounding landscape, leading to habitat degradation and reduced animal densities within an area that is considerably larger than the actual road or railway corridor. For birds, an extensive meta-analysis has pointed at an average of 20% density reduction within 1 km from the infrastructure. I investigated to what extent this density reduction could potentially compromise the habitat quality and conservation value of Swedish Natura 2000 areas designated for the protection of birds (Special Protection Areas; SPAs). A majority (63%) of Swedish SPAs are at least to some extent found within this 1 km potential effect zone. The total overlap between SPA and effect zone is 126,000 ha, or 4.2% of the countrys SPA area. There are however large differences among biogeographical regions. In the southern (continental) and coastal regions combined, 25.8% of the total SPA area fall within the effect zone, representing an estimated 4-7% reduction in bird abundance within SPAs. The probability of overlap with effect zone is higher for larger SPAs. However, the proportion of overlap is higher for smaller SPAs, and accordingly smaller sites can be assumed to experience a greater impact from transport infrastructure and traffic. The impacts on Natura 2000 sites are particularly concerning as this network of protected areas is a cornerstone to maintain and restore biodiversity within EU. I recommend putting a stronger emphasis in the management of Natura 2000 sites on the potential threats to wildlife conservation caused by transport infrastructure and traffic. Special attention should be paid in sites with a large overlap with the effect zone, and in sites hosting particularly vulnerable taxa or habitats. Infrastructure owners and managers should do their best to minimize and compensate for the negative impacts of roads and railways and related traffic in SPAs and other protected areas.",

    "abstract": "Gene-for-gene immunity between plants and host-adapted pathogens is often linked to population-level diversification of immune receptors encoded by disease resistance (R) genes. The complex barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) R gene locus Mildew Locus A (Mla) provides isolate-specific resistance against the powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh) and has been introgressed into modern barley cultivars from diverse germplasms, including the wild relative H. spontaneum. Known Mla disease resistance specificities to Bgh appear to encode allelic variants of the R Gene Homolog 1 (RGH1) family of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins. To gain insights into Mla diversity in wild barley populations, we here sequenced and assembled the transcriptomes of 50 accessions of H. spontaneum representing nine populations distributed throughout the Fertile Crescent. The assembled Mla transcripts exhibited rich sequence diversity, which is linked neither to geographic origin nor population structure. Mla transcripts in the tested H. spontaneum accessions could be grouped into two similar-sized subfamilies based on two major N-terminal coiled-coil signaling domains that are both capable of eliciting cell death. The presence of positively selected sites, located mainly in the C-terminal leucine-rich repeats of both MLA subfamilies, together with the fact that both coiled-coil signaling domains mediate cell death, implies that the two subfamilies are actively maintained in the host population. Unexpectedly, known MLA receptor variants that confer Bgh resistance belong exclusively to one subfamily. Thus, signaling domain divergence, potentially to distinct pathogen populations, is an evolutionary signature of functional diversification of an immune receptor.",

    "abstract": "The proper regulation of cell cycle transitions is paramount to the maintenance of cellular genome integrity. In budding yeast, the mitotic exit network (MEN) is a Ras-like signaling cascade that effects the transition from M phase to G1 during the cell division cycle in budding yeast. MEN activation is tightly regulated. It occurs during anaphase and is coupled to mitotic spindle position by the spindle position checkpoint (SPoC). Bfa1 is a key component of the SPoC and functions as part of a two-component GAP complex along with Bub2. The GAP activity of Bfa1-Bub2 keeps the MEN GTPase Tem1 inactive in cells with mispositioned spindles, thereby preventing inappropriate mitotic exit and preserving genome integrity. Interestingly, a GAP-independent role for Bfa1 in mitotic exit regulation has been previously identified. However the nature of this Bub2-independent role and its biological significance are not understood. Here we show that Bfa1 also activates the MEN by promoting the localization of Tem1 primarily to the daughter spindle pole body (dSPB). We demonstrate that the overexpression of BFA1 is lethal due to defects in Tem1 localization, which is required for its activity. In addition, our studies demonstrate a Tem1-independent role for Bfa1 in promoting proper cytokinesis. Cells lacking TEM1, in which the essential mitotic exit function is bypassed, exhibit cytokinesis defects. These defects are suppressed by the overexpression of BFA1. We conclude that Bfa1 functions to both inhibit and activate late mitotic events.",

We then investigate the effects on heritability of the parental origin of alleles in outbred heterogeneous stock rats across 199 complex traits. Parent-of-origin-like heritability was on average 2.7-fold larger than classical additive heritability. Among the phenotypes with the most enhanced parent-of-origin heritability were 10 coping style behaviors, with average 3.2-fold heritability enrichment. To confirm these findings on coping behaviour, and to eliminate the possibility that the parent of origin effects are due to confounding with shared environment, we performed a reciprocal F1 cross between the behaviourally divergent RHA and RLA rat strains. We observed parent-of-origin effects on F1 rat anxiety/coping-related behavior in the Elevated Zero Maze test. Our results are the first to assess genetic parent-of-origin effects in rats, and confirm earlier findings in mice that such effects influence mammalian coping and impulsive behavior.",

For example, work in mouse shows that rod photoreceptor signals are routed through several retinal pathways, each specialized for different light levels. This light level-dependent routing of rod signals has been invoked to explain several human perceptual results, but it has not been tested in primate retina. Here we show, surprisingly, that rod signals traverse the primate retina almost exclusively through a single pathway, regardless of light level. Indeed, identical experiments in mouse and primate reveal large differences in how rod signals traverse the retina. These results require reevaluating human perceptual results in terms of flexible computation within this single pathway. This includes a prominent speeding of rod signals with light level - which we show is inherited directly from the rods photoreceptors themselves rather than from different pathways with different kinetics.",

It is well-established that WM performance can be enhanced by a retrospective cue presented during storage, yet the neural mechanisms responsible for this benefit are unclear. Here, we tested several explanations for retro-cue benefits by quantifying changes in spatial WM representations reconstructed from alpha-band (8-12 Hz) EEG activity recorded from human participants (both sexes) before and after presentation of a retrospective cue. This allowed us to track cue-related changes in WM representations with high temporal resolution (tens of milliseconds). Participants encoded the locations of two colored discs for subsequent report. During neutral trials an uninformative cue instructed participants to remember the locations of both discs across a blank delay, and we observed a monotonic decrease in the fidelity of reconstructed spatial WM representations with time. During valid trials a 100% reliable cue indicated the color of the disc participants would be probed to report. Critically, valid cues were presented immediately after termination of the encoding display (\\\"valid early\\\", or VE trials) or midway through the delay period (\\\"valid late\\\" or VL trials). During VE trials the gradual loss of location-specific information observed during neutral trials was eliminated, while during VL trials it was partially reversed. Our findings suggest that retro-cues engage several different mechanisms that together serve to mitigate information loss during WM storage.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWorking memory (WM) performance can be improved by a cue presented during storage. This effect, termed a retrospective cue benefit, has been used to explore the limitations of attentional prioritization in WM. However, the mechanisms responsible for retrospective cue benefits are unclear. Here we tested several explanations for retrospective cue benefits by examining how they influence WM representations reconstructed from human EEG activity. This approach allowed us to visualize, quantify, and track the effects of retrospective cues with high temporal resolution (on the order of tens of milliseconds). We show that under different circumstances retrospective cues can both eliminate and even partially reverse information loss during WM storage, suggesting that retrospective cue benefits have manifold origins.",

During early life, most sensory systems are still largely immature. As a notable exception, the olfactory system reaches full maturity during intrauterine life, controlling mother-offspring interactions and neonatal survival. Here, we elucidate the structural and functional principles underlying the communication between olfactory bulb (OB) and lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) - the gatekeeper of limbic circuitry - during neonatal mouse development. Combining optogenetics, pharmacology, and electrophysiology in vivo with axonal tracing, we show that mitral cell-dependent discontinuous theta bursts in OB drive network oscillations and time the firing in LEC via axonal projections confined to upper cortical layers. Pharmacological silencing of OB activity diminishes entorhinal oscillations. Moreover, odor exposure boosts OB-entorhinal coupling at fast frequencies. Thus, early OB activity shapes the maturation of entorhinal circuits.",

In Experiment 1 participants learned category-exemplar pairs with repeated study or combined study-full test sessions followed by a selective retrieval practice and a full cued-recall test. We found lower difference between performance on the non-practiced items from practiced categories (Rp-) and their baseline from unpracticed categories (Nrp-) suggesting a reduction in retrieval-induced forgetting. However, regression analysis revealed that this was possibly caused by the increased recall performance independently from the presence of an initial full retrieval session. Therefore, in Experiment 2 participants learned the same pairs through a study followed by two study, two test or combined study-test cycles. As the consequence of increased rate of learning we confirmed the complete absence of retrieval-induced forgetting with Bayes factor analysis. Our results suggest that the adverse memory effect of selective retrieval practice shows a non monotonic dependency on the strength of the mnemonic representations.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe controversial origin of extant amphibians has been studied using several sources of data and methods, including phylogenetic analyses of morphological data, molecular dating, stratigraphic data, and integration of ossification sequence data, but a consensus has failed to emerge. We have compiled five datasets to assess the relative support for six competing hypotheses about the origin of extant amphibians: a monophyletic origin among temnospondyls, a monophyletic origin among lepospondyls, a diphyletic origin among both temnospondyls and lepospondyls, a diphyletic origin among temnospondyls alone, and two variants of a triphyletic origin, in which anurans and urodeles come from different temnospondyl taxa while caecilians come from lepospondyls and are either closer to anurans and urodeles or to amniotes. Our datasets comprise ossification sequences of up to 107 terminal taxa and up to eight cranial bones, and up to 65 terminal taxa and up to seven appendicular bones, respectively. Among extinct taxa, only two or three temnospondyl can be analyzed simultaneously for cranial data, but this is not an insuperable problem because each of the six tested hypotheses implies a different position of temnospondyls and caecilians relative to other sampled taxa. For appendicular data, more extinct taxa can be analyzed, including some lepospondyls and the finned tetrapodomorph Eusthenopteron, in addition to temnospondyls. The data are analyzed through maximum likelihood, and the AICc (corrected Akaike Information Criterion) weights of the six hypotheses allow us to assess their relative support. By an unexpectedly large margin, our analyses of the cranial data support a monophyletic origin among lepospondyls; a monophyletic origin among temnospondyls, the current near-consensus, is a distant second. All other hypotheses are exceedingly unlikely according to our data. Surprisingly, analysis of the appendicular data supports triphyly of extant amphibians within a clade that unites lepospondyls and temnospondyls, contrary to all molecular and recent paleontological phylogenies, but this conclusion is not very robust.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) is not only one of the worlds most important crops, but it also is a powerful tool for studies of genetics, genomics, and cytology. The genome of maize shows the unmistakable signature of an ancient hybridization event followed by whole genome duplication (allopolyploidy), but the parents of this event have been a mystery for over a century, since studies of maize cytogenetics began. Here we show that the whole genome duplication event preceded the divergence of the entire genus Zea and its sister genus Tripsacum. One genome was donated, in whole or in part, by a plant related to the modern African genera Urelytrum and Vossia, although genomic rearrangement has been extensive. The other genome donor is less well-supported, but may have been related to the modern Rottboellia-Hemarthria clade, which is also African. Thus Zea and Tripsacum together represent a New World radiation derived from African ancestors.",

By generating and analysing time-lapse series of regenerating root tips captured with confocal microscopy, we are able to extract and model the dynamics of key morphological traits at cellular resolution. We present a linear stability analysis of its Markovian dynamics, with the stationary state representing the intact root in the space of morphological traits.

    "abstract": "In mammalian cells, >25% of synthesized proteins are exported through the secretory pathway. The pathway complexity, however, obfuscates its impact on the secretion of different proteins. Unraveling its impact on diverse proteins is particularly important for biopharmaceutical production. Here we delineate the core secretory pathway functions and integrate them with genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of human, mouse, and Chinese hamster cells. The resulting reconstructions enable the computation of energetic costs and machinery demands of each secreted protein. By integrating additional omics data, we find that highly secretory cells have adapted to reduce expression and secretion of other expensive host cell proteins. Furthermore, we predict metabolic costs and maximum productivities of biotherapeutic proteins and identify protein features that most significantly impact protein secretion. Finally, the model successfully predicts the increase in secretion of a monoclonal antibody after silencing a highly expressed selection marker. This work represents a knowledgebase of the mammalian secretory pathway that serves as a novel tool for systems biotechnology.",

Despite being well studied and having a rich repertoire of social and extractive foraging traditions, Cebus sp have rarely been observed engaging in tool use and have never been reported to use stone tools. In contrast, habitual tool use and stone-tool use by Sapajus is widespread. We discuss factors which might explain these differences in patterns of tool use between Cebus and Sapajus. We then report the first case of habitual stone-tool use in a gracile capuchin: a population of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator) in Coiba National Park, Panama who habitually rely on hammerstone and anvil tool use to access structurally protected food items in coastal areas including Terminalia catappa seeds, hermit crabs, marine snails, terrestrial crabs, and other items. This behavior has persisted on one island in Coiba National Park since at least 2004. From one year of camera trapping, we found that stone tool use is strongly male-biased. Of the 205 unique camera-trap-days where tool use was recorded, adult females were never observed to use stone-tools, although they were frequently recorded at the sites and engaged in scrounging behavior. Stone-tool use occurs year-round in this population, and over half of all identifiable individuals were observed participating. At the most active tool use site, 83.2% of days where capuchins were sighted corresponded with tool use. Capuchins inhabiting the Coiba archipelago are highly terrestrial, under decreased predation pressure and potentially experience resource limitation compared to mainland populations- three conditions considered important for the evolution of stone tool use. White-faced capuchin tool use in Coiba National Park thus offers unique opportunities to explore the ecological drivers and evolutionary underpinnings of stone tool use in a comparative within- and between-species context.",

Here, we present a validated method for targeted and semi-quantitative analysis of 102 polar metabolites that covers major metabolic pathways from 24 classes in a single 17.5-min assay. The method has been optimized for a wide range of biological matrices from various organisms, and involves automated sample preparation, and data processing using in-house developed R package. To ensure reliability, the method was validated for accuracy, precision, selectivity, specificity, linearity, recovery, and stability according to European Medicines Agency guidelines. We demonstrated excellent repeatability of the retention times (CV<4%), calibration curves (R2[&ge;]0.980) in their respective wide dynamic concentration ranges (CV<3%), and concentrations (CV<25%) of quality control samples interspersed within 25 batches analyzed over a period of one-year. The robustness was demonstrated through high correlation between metabolite concentrations measured using our method and NIST reference values (R2=0.967), including cross-platform comparability against the BIOCRATES AbsoluteIDQp180 kit (R2=0.975) and NMR analyses (R2=0.884). We have shown that our method can be successfully applied in many biomedical research fields and clinical trials, including epidemiological studies for biomarker discovery. In summary, a thorough validation demonstrated that our method is reproducible, robust, reliable, and suitable for metabolomics studies.",

    "abstract": "The advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies has opened new perspectives in deciphering the genetic mechanisms underlying complex diseases. Nowadays, the amount of genomic data is massive and substantial efforts and new tools are required to unveil the information hidden in the data.\\n\\nThe Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal is a large data collection platform that includes different genomic studies included the ones from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) initiatives, accounting for more than 40 tumor types originating from nearly 30000 patients. Such platforms, although very attractive, must make sure the stored data are easily accessible and adequately harmonized. Moreover, they have the primary focus on the data storage in a unique place, and they do not provide a comprehensive toolkit for analyses and interpretation of the data. To fulfill this urgent need, comprehensive but easily accessible computational methods for integrative analyses of genomic data without renouncing a robust statistical and theoretical framework are needed. In this context, the R/Bioconductor package TCGAbiolinks was developed, offering a variety of bioinformatics functionalities. Here we introduce new features and enhancements of TCGAbiolinks in terms of i) more accurate and flexible pipelines for differential expression analyses, ii) different methods for tumor purity estimation and filtering, iii) integration of normal samples from the Genotype-Tissue-Expression (GTEx) platform iv) support for other genomics datasets, here exemplified by the TARGET data.\\n\\nEvidence has shown that accounting for tumor purity is essential in the study of tumorigenesis, as these factors promote confounding behavior regarding differential expression analysis. Henceforth, we implemented these filtering procedures in TCGAbiolinks. Moreover, a limitation of some of the TCGA datasets is the unavailability or paucity of corresponding normal samples. We thus integrated into TCGAbiolinks the possibility to use normal samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, which is another large-scale repository cataloging gene expression from healthy individuals. The new functionalities are available in the TCGABiolinks v 2.8 and higher released in Bioconductor version 3.7.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate projection methods are unique in being both multivariable by combining many variables into stronger predictive features (latent variables), and multivariate for being able to model systematic variation both related and orthogonal to an observed response. Orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) is a versatile multivariate projection method for analysis of correlation, discrimination and effect changes. However, currently OPLS is not fully using its multivariate potential since orthogonal systematic variation is not considered in model interpretation, resulting in univariate interpretation of variable significance. We present a strategy for improved interpretation of OPLS models based upon a post-hoc linear regression analysis that can be used with or without the orthogonal OPLS score(s) as a covariate to make the interpretation multivariate or univariate respectively. By selecting the observed response y or estimated response yhat as a one of the factors in the linear regression the results are related to either of the OPLS loadings w or p. Furthermore, converting the OPLS loading values to statistical t-values creates a direct link to statistical significance. Finally, by applying three different Boolean loadings W, P and W{wedge}P variable significance can be summarized based on three criteria. W and P reveal if the values in w or p respectively are outside the statistical limits with W{wedge}P being the logical conjunction of W and P (significant if outside limits in both W and P). Two examples are used to verify the proposed strategy. First, a synthetic example, simulating a mix of mass spectra, and second a clinical metabolomics study of a dietary intervention. In the simulated example we show that multivariate interpretation gives higher accuracy for estimation of true differences, mainly due to higher true positive rate. Furthermore, we highlight how application of W{wedge}P for summarizing variable significance leads to higher accuracy. For the metabolomics example, we show that a more detailed interpretation, i.e. larger number of significant metabolites of relevance, is obtained using the multivariate interpretation. In summary, the suggested strategy provides means for facilitated interpretation of OPLS models, beyond univariate statistics, and offers a multivariate tool for discovery of biomarker patterns, i.e. latent biomarkers.",

African American men (AA) represent more aggressive form of PCa as compared to Caucasian (CA) counterparts. Evidence suggests that genetic and other biological factors could account for the observed racial disparity. We analyzed the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) dataset (2015) for existing epigenetic variation in AA and CA prostate cancer patients, and carried out Reduced Representation Bisulphite Sequencing (RRBS) analysis to identify global methylation changes in AA and CA prostate cancer patients. The TCGA dataset analysis revealed that the epigenetic heterogeneity could be categorized into 4 classes, where AA associated primarily to methylation cluster 1 (p value 0.048), and CA associated to methylation cluster 3 (p value 0.000146). We identified enrichment of Wnt signaling genes in both AA and CA, however they were differentially activated in terms of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway activation. This was further validated using the GenomeDx expression data. Our RRBS data also suggested distinct methylation patterns in AA compared to CA, and in part validated our TCGA findings. Survival analysis using the RRBS data suggested hypomethylated genes to be significantly associated with recurrence of prostate cancer in CA (p=6.07x10-6) as well as in AA (p=0.0077). Overall, the observed racial disparity in the molecular mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer suggests diverse heterogeneity that potentially could affect survival and should be considered during prognosis and treatment.",

Current methodologies for parasite RNA extraction involve several steps and when multiple time points are profiled, these protocols are laborious, time consuming, and require the euthanisation of large cohorts of mice. We designed a simplified protocol for parasite RNA extraction from blood volumes as low as 20 microliters (microsamples), serially bled from mice via tail snips and directly lysed with TRIzol reagent. Gene expression data derived from microsampling using RNA-seq were closely matched to those derived from larger volumes of leucocyte-depleted and saponin-treated blood obtained from euthanized mice and also tightly correlated between biological replicates. Transcriptome profiling of microsamples taken at different time points during the intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium vinckei revealed the transcriptional cascade commonly observed in malaria parasites.

Here we show that the nucleoprotein filaments rarely trigger sufficient synthesis to form an irreversible repair unless a long strand exchange product forms at the 3' end of the filament. Our experimental data and modeling suggest that terminating both filaments with Chi sites allows recombinational repair to strongly suppress fatal genomic rearrangements resulting from mistakenly joining different copies of a repeated sequence after a DSB has occurred within a repeat.

Yet, whether this phosphorylation can regulate the localization, and thus function, of KIF17 in ciliary photoreceptors remains unknown.\\n\\nResultsUsing transgenic expression in both mammalian cells and zebrafish photoreceptors, we show that phospho-mimetic KIF17 has enhanced localization to cilia. Importantly, expression of phospho-mimetic KIF17 is associated with greatly enhanced turnover of the photoreceptor outer segment through disc shedding in a cell-autonomous manner, while genetic mutants of kif17 in zebrafish and mice have diminished disc shedding. Lastly, cone expression of constitutively active tCaMKII leads to a kif17-dependent increase in disc shedding.\\n\\nConclusionsTaken together, our data support a model in which phosphorylation of KIF17 promotes its ciliary localization. In cone photoreceptor outer segments, this promotes disc shedding, a process essential for photoreceptor maintenance and homeostasis. While disc shedding has been predominantly studied in the context of the mechanisms underlying phagocytosis of outer segments by the retinal pigment epithelium, this work implicates photoreceptor-derived signaling in the underlying mechanisms of disc shedding.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation affecting the binding of transcription factors (TFs) has been proposed as a major mechanism underlying susceptibility to common disease. NKX2-5, a key cardiac development TF, has been associated with electrocardiographic (EKG) traits through GWAS, but the extent to which differential binding of NKX2-5 contributes to these traits has not yet been studied. Here, we analyzed transcriptomic and epigenomic data generated from iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte lines (iPSC-CMs) from seven whole-genome sequenced individuals in a three-generational family. We identified ~2,000 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with allele-specific effects (ASE) on NKX2-5 binding. These ASE-SNVs were enriched for altered TF motifs (both cognate and other cardiac TFs), and were positively correlated with changes in H3K27ac in iPSC-CMs, suggesting they impact cardiac enhancer activity. We found that NKX2-ASE-SNVs were significantly enriched for being heart-specific eQTLs and EKG GWAS variants, suggesting that altered NKX2-5 binding at multiple sites across the genome influences EKG traits. We used a fine-mapping approach to integrate iPSC-CM molecular phenotype data with a GWAS for heart rate, and determined that NKX2-5 ASE variants are likely causal for numerous known, as well as previously unidentified, heart rate loci. Analyzing Hi-C and gene expression data from iPSC-CMs at these heart rate loci, we identified several genes likely to be causally involved in heart rate variability. Our study demonstrates that differential binding of NKX2-5 is a common mechanism underlying genetic association with EKG traits, and shows that characterizing variants associated with differential binding of development TFs in iPSC-derived cell lines can identify novel loci and mechanisms influencing complex traits.",

However, whether interspecific trait-environment relationships are consistent at the intraspecific level is yet unknown. Moreover, we do not know how consistent is the response between organ vs. whole-tree level.\nC_LIO_LIWe examined phenotypic variability for 16 functional leaf (dimensions, nutrient, chlorophyll) and wood traits (density) across two soil types, Ferralitic Soil (FS) vs. White Sands (WS), on two sites for 70 adult trees of Cecropia obtusa Trecul (Urticaceae) in French Guiana. Cecropia is a widespread pioneer Neotropical genus that generally dominates early successional forest stages. To understand how soil types impact resource-use through the processes of growth and branching, we examined the architectural development with a retrospective analysis of growth trajectories. We expect soil types to affect both, functional traits in relation to resource acquisition strategy as already described at the interspecific level, and growth strategies due to resource limitations with reduced growth on poor soils.\nC_LIO_LIFunctional traits were not involved in the soil response, as only two traits-leaf residual water content and K content-showed significant differences across soil types. Soil effects were stronger on growth trajectories, with WS trees having the slowest growth trajectories and less numerous branches across their lifespan.\nC_LIO_LIThe analysis of growth trajectories based on architectural analysis improved our ability to characterise the response of trees with soil types. The intraspecific variability is higher for growth trajectories than functional traits for C. obtusa, revealing the complementarity of the architectural approach with the functional approach to gain insights on the way trees manage their resources over their lifetime. Soil-related responses of Cecropia functional traits are not the same as those at the interspecific level, suggesting that the effects of the acting ecological processes are different between the two levels. Apart from soil differences, much variation was found across sites, which calls for further investigation of the factors shaping growth trajectories in tropical forests.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several hundred susceptibility loci for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). One critical, but unresolved, issue concerns the extent to which the mechanisms through which these diverse signals influencing T2D predisposition converge on a limited set of biological processes. However, the causal variants identified by GWAS mostly fall into non-coding sequence, complicating the task of defining the effector transcripts through which they operate. Here, we describe implementation of an analytical pipeline to address this question. First, we integrate multiple sources of genetic, genomic, and biological data to assign positional candidacy scores to the genes that map to T2D GWAS signals. Second, we introduce genes with high scores as seeds within a network optimization algorithm (the asymmetric prize-collecting Steiner Tree approach) which uses external, experimentally-confirmed protein-protein interaction (PPI) data to generate high confidence subnetworks. Third, we use GWAS data to test the T2D-association enrichment of the \\\"non-seed\\\" proteins introduced into the network, as a measure of the overall functional connectivity of the network. We find: (a) non-seed proteins in the T2D protein-interaction network so generated (comprising 705 nodes) are enriched for association to T2D (p=0.0014) but not control traits; (b) stronger T2D-enrichment for islets than other tissues when we use RNA expression data to generate tissue-specific PPI networks; and (c) enhanced enrichment (p=3.9xl0-5) when we combine analysis of the islet-specific PPI network with a focus on the subset of T2D GWAS loci which act through defective insulin secretion. These analyses reveal a pattern of non-random functional connectivity between causal candidate genes atT2D GWAS loci, and highlight the products of genes including YWHAG, SMAD4 or CDK2 as contributors to T2D-relevant islet dysfunction. The approach we describe can be applied to other complex genetic and genomic data sets, facilitating integration of diverse data types into disease-associated networks.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe were interested in the following question: as we discover more and more genetic variants associated with a complex disease, such as type 2 diabetes, will the biological pathways implicated by those variants proliferate, or will the biology converge onto a more limited set of aetiological processes? To address this, we first took the 1895 genes that map to ~100 type 2 diabetes association signals, and pruned these to a set of 451 for which combined genetic, genomic and biological evidence assigned the strongest candidacy with respect to type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. We then sought to maximally connect these genes within a curated protein-protein interaction network. We found that proteins brought into the resulting diabetes interaction network were themselves enriched for diabetes association signals as compared to appropriate control proteins. Furthermore, when we used tissue-specific RNA abundance data to filter the generic protein-protein network, we found that the enrichment for type 2 diabetes association signals was enhanced within a network filtered for pancreatic islet expression, particularly when we selected the subset of diabetes association signals acting through reduced insulin secretion. Our data demonstrate convergence of the biological processes involved in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis and highlight novel contributors.",

    "abstract": "Ornaments used in courtship often vary wildly among species, reflecting the evolutionary interplay between mate preference functions and the constraints imposed by natural selection. Consequently, understanding the evolutionary dynamics responsible for ornament diversification has been a longstanding challenge in evolutionary biology. However, comparing radically different ornaments across species, as well as different classes of ornaments within species, is a profound challenge to understanding diversification of sexual signals. Using novel methods and a unique natural history dataset, we explore evolutionary patterns of ornament evolution in a group - the birds-of-paradise - exhibiting dramatic phenotypic diversification widely assumed to be driven by sexual selection. Rather than the tradeoff between ornament types originally envisioned by Darwin and Wallace, we found positive correlations among cross-modal (visual/acoustic) signals indicating functional integration of ornamental traits into a composite unit - the courtship phenotype. Furthermore, given the broad theoretical and empirical support for the idea that systemic robustness - functional overlap and interdependency - promotes evolutionary innovation, we posit that birds-of-paradise have radiated extensively through ornamental phenotype space as a consequence of the robustness in the courtship phenotype that we document at a phylogenetic scale. We suggest that the degree of robustness in courtship phenotypes among taxa can provide new insights into the relative influence of sexual and natural selection on phenotypic radiations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAnimals frequently vary widely in ornamentation, even among closely related species. Understanding the patterns that underlie this variation is a significant challenge, requiring comparisons among drastically different traits - like comparing apples to oranges. Here, we use novel analytical approaches to quantify variation in ornamental diversity and richness across the wildly divergent birds-of-paradise, a textbook example of how sexual selection can profoundly shape organismal phenotypes. We find that color and acoustic complexity, along with behavior and acoustic complexity, are positively correlated across evolutionary time-scales. Positive covariation among ornament classes suggests that selection is acting on correlated suites of traits - a composite courtship phenotype - and that this integration may be partially responsible for the extreme variation we see in birds-of-paradise.",

    "abstract": "A novel concept has emerged whereby the higher-order self-assembly of proteins provides a simple and robust mechanism for signal amplification. This appears to be a universal signalling mechanism within the innate immune system, where the recognition of pathogens or danger-associated molecular patterns need to trigger a strong, binary response within cells. Previously, multiple structural studies have been limited to single domains, expressed and assembled at high protein concentrations. We therefore set out to develop new in vitro strategies to characterise the behaviour of full-length proteins at physiological levels. In this study we focus on the adaptor protein MyD88, which contains two domains with different self-assembly properties: a TIR domain that can polymerise similarly to the TIR domain of Mal, and a Death Domain that has been shown to oligomerise with helical symmetry in the Myddosome complex. To visualize the behaviour of full-length MyD88 without purification steps, we use single-molecule fluorescence coupled to eukaryotic cell-free protein expression. These experiments demonstrate that at low protein concentration, only full-length MyD88 forms prion-like polymers. We also demonstrate that the metastability of MyD88 polymerisation creates the perfect binary response required in innate signalling: the system is silenced at normal concentrations but upstream signalling creates a \\\"seed\\\" that triggers polymerisation and amplification of the response. These findings pushed us to re-interpret the role of polymerisation in MyD88-related diseases and we studied the impact of disease-associated point mutations L93P, R196C and L252P/L265P at the molecular level. We discovered that all mutations completely block the ability of MyD88 to polymerise. We also confirm that L252P, a gain-of-function mutation, allows the MyD88 mutant to form extremely stable oligomers, even when expressed at low nanomolar concentrations. Thus, our results are consistent with and greatly add to the findings on the Myddosomes digital  all-or-none responses and the behaviour of the oncogenic mutation of MyD88.",

Here, we quantitatively interrogate this relationship using Hi-C and molecular phenotype data across cell types and haplotypes. We find that chromatin loops consistently form across multiple cell types and quantitatively vary in strength, instead of exclusively forming within only one cell type. We show that large haplotype loop imbalance is primarily associated with imprinting and copy number variation, rather than genetically driven traits such as allele-specific expression. Finally, across cell types and haplotypes, we show that subtle changes in chromatin loop strength are associated with large differences in other molecular phenotypes, with a 2-fold change in looping corresponding to a 100-fold change in gene expression. Our study suggests that regulatory genetic variation could mediate its effects on gene expression through subtle modification of chromatin loop strength.",
