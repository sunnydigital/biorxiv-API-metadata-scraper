    "abstract": "We consider an extension to discrete-space continuous-time models animal movement that have previously be presented in the literature. The extension from a continuous-time Markov formulation to a continuous-time semi-Markov formulation allows for the inclusion of temporally dynamic habitat conditions as well as temporally changing movement responses by animals to that environment. We show that with only a little additional consideration, the Poisson likelihood approximation for the Markov version can still be used within the multiple imputation framework commonly employed for analysis of telemetry data. In addition, we consider a Bayesian model selection methodology with the imputation framework. The model selection method uses a Laplace approximation to the posterior model probability to provide a computationally feasible approach. The full methodology is then used to analyze movements of 15 northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) pups with respect to surface winds, geostrophic currents, and sea surface temperature. The highest posterior model probabilities belonged to those models containing only winds and current, SST did not seem to be a significant factor for modeling their movement.",

    "abstract": "Electric fishes are a diverse group of freshwater organisms with the ability to generate electric organ discharges (EODs) that are used for communication and electrolocation. Over 200 species have originated in South America, but of these, only a few have managed to colonize the Central American Isthmus. Here, we assembled two complete and one nearly complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) for three Central American Gymnotiformes: Sternopygus dariensis, Brachyhypopomus occidentalis and Apteronotus rostratus. We then explored the three species phylogenetic position in the context of South American electric fishes. Mitogenomes were organized in the standard fish mitogenome order, and presented sizes of 16,600, 16,540 and 15,940 base pairs (bp) (nearly complete) for S. dariensis, B. occidentalis and A. rostratus, respectively. We uncovered a novel 60 bp intergenic spacer (IGS) located between the COII and tRNALys genes, which appears to be unique to the Apteronotidae. Furthermore, phylogenetic relationships supported the traditional monophyly of Gymnotiformes, with the three species positioned within their respective family. In addition, the genus Apteronotus was placed as the basal taxon of the order. Finally, we found high sequence divergence (13.3%) between our B. occidentalis specimen and a sequence previously reported in GenBank, suggesting that the prior mitogenome of B. occidentalis represents a different South American species that was misidentified. Indeed, phylogenetic analyses using Cytochrome b gene across the genus placed the previously reported individual within B. bennetti. Our study provides novel mitogenome resources that will advance our understanding of the diversity and phylogenetic history of Neotropical fishes.",

    "abstract": "For insects that depend on one or more bacterial endosymbionts for survival, it is critical that these bacteria are faithfully transmitted between insect generations. Cicadas harbor two essential bacterial endosymbionts, Sulcia muelleri and Hodgkinia cicadicola. In some cicada species, Hodgkinia has fragmented into multiple distinct cellular and genomic lineages that can differ in abundance by more than two orders of magnitude. This complexity presents a potential problem for the host cicada, because low-abundance-but-essential Hodgkinia lineages risk being lost during the symbiont transmission bottleneck from mother to egg. Here we show that all cicada eggs seem to receive the full complement of Hodgkinia lineages, and that in cicadas with more complex Hodgkinia this outcome is achieved by increasing the number of Hodgkinia cells transmitted by up to six-fold. We further show that cicada species with varying Hodgkinia complexity do not visibly alter their transmission mechanism at the resolution of cell biological structures. Together these data suggest that a major cicada adaptation to changes in endosymbiont complexity is an increase in the number of Hodgkinia cells transmitted to each egg. We hypothesize that the requirement to increase the symbiont titer is one of the costs associated with Hodgkinia fragmentation.",

    "abstract": "The use of Direct To Consumer (DTC) genetic testing for predicting health risks and a variety of other phenotypes has been extensively discussed. Additionally, there have been wide ranging discourses on privacy and ethical concerns. Much less attention has been paid to what most people actually use DTC testing for: ancestry determination. Furthermore, comparison of the platforms used by different companies and how they have chosen SNPs to address the questions of health and ancestry have not been broadly reported. When SNPs across three genotyping platforms are compared, only 16-18% of SNPs with reported genotypes are shared across all platforms. Only 110,051 of the more than 600,000 SNPs are called on all three panels examined (Ancestry, 23andMe and MyHeritage). SNPs genotyped on all platforms are highly concordant with only two SNPs having discordant calls. When the SNPs unique to a single panel are examined, it is apparent that each company has its own strategy for choosing SNPs. When each platform is examined, the unique SNPs have different frequencies, ethnic selectivities, and chromosomal locations. Because each company separates the world into different, overlapping geographical regions, it is impossible to do an exact comparison of ancestry results. Factoring in the ways the regions overlap, congruent results are generated for the major contributors to ancestry.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput phenotyping has emerged as a powerful method for studying plant biology. Large image-based datasets are generated and analyzed with automated image analysis pipelines. A major challenge associated with these analyses is variation in image quality that can inadvertently bias results. Images are made up of tuples of data called pixels, which consist of R, G, and B values, arranged in a grid. Many factors, for example image brightness, can influence the quality of the image that is captured. These factors alter the values of the pixels within images and consequently can bias the data and downstream analyses. Here, we provide an automated method to adjust an image-based dataset so that brightness, contrast, and color profile is standardized. The correction method is a collection of linear models that adjusts pixel tuples based on a reference panel of colors. We apply this technique to a set of images taken in a high-throughput imaging facility and successfully detect variance within the image dataset. In this case, variation resulted from temperature-dependent light intensity throughout the experiment. Using this correction method, we were able to standardize images throughout the dataset, and we show that this correction enhanced our ability to accurately quantify morphological measurements within each image. We implement this technique in a high-throughput pipeline available with this paper, and it is also implemented in PlantCV.",

    "abstract": "Targeting gene function with spatial or temporal specificity is a key goal in molecular genetics. CRISPR-Cas9 has greatly facilitated this strategy, but some standard approaches are problematic. For instance, simple tissue-specific or global overexpression of Cas9 can cause significant lethality or developmental delays even in the absence of gRNAs. In particular, we found that Gal4-mediated expression of UAS-Cas9 in the Drosophila prothoracic gland (PG) was not a suitable strategy to disrupt gene expression, since Cas9 alone caused widespread lethality. The PG gland is widely used for studying endocrine gland function during animal development, but tools validating PG-specific RNAi phenotypes are lacking. Here, we present a collection of modular gateway-compatible CRISPR-Cas9 tools that allow precise modulation of target gene activity with temporal and spatial specificity. We also demonstrate that Cas9 fused to the progesterone ligand-binding domain can be used to activate gene expression via RU486. Using these approaches, we were able to avoid the lethality associated with simple GAL4-mediated overexpression of Cas9 in the PG. Given that the PG is a polytene tissue, we conclude that these tools work effectively in endoreplicating cells where Cas9 has to target multiple copies of the same locus. Our toolkit can be easily adapted for other tissues and can be used both for gain-and loss-of-function studies.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian visual system is one of the most well-studied brain systems. Visual information from the retina is relayed to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGd). The LGd then projects topographically to primary visual cortex (VISp) to mediate visual perception. In this view, the VISp is a critical network hub where visual information must traverse LGd-VISp circuits to reach higher-order  extrastriate visual cortices. However, decades of conflicting reports in a variety of mammals support or refute the existence of extrastriate LGd connections that can bypass the VISp. Here, we provide evidence of bidirectional extrastriate connectivity with the mouse LGd. Using small, discrete coinjections of anterograde and retrograde tracers within the thalamus and cortex, our cross-validated approach identified bidirectional thalamocortical connectivity between LGd and extrastriate visual cortices. Our findings support the existence of extrastriate LGd circuits and provide novel understanding of LGd organization in rodent visual system.",

    "abstract": "Plant pathogenic fungi secrete effector proteins and secondary metabolites to cause disease. Additionally, some produce small RNAs (sRNAs) that silence transcripts of host immunity genes through RNA interference. The fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum infects over 600 plant species, but little is known about its molecular interactions with its hosts. In particular, the role of sRNAs in S. sclerotiorum pathogenicity has not been determined. By sequencing sRNAs in vitro and during infection of two host species, we found that S. sclerotiorum produces at least 374 highly abundant sRNAs. These sRNAs mostly originated from polymorphic repeat-rich genomic regions. Predicted gene targets of these sRNAs, from 10 different host species, were enriched for immunity-related functional domains. Predicted A. thaliana gene targets of S. sclerotiorum sRNAs were significantly more down-regulated during infection than other genes. A. thaliana gene targets were also more likely to contain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with quantitative disease resistance. In conclusion, sRNAs produced by S. sclerotiorum are likely capable of silencing immunity components in multiple hosts. Prediction of fungal sRNA targets in host plant genomes can be combined with other global approaches, such as genome wide association studies and transcriptomics, to assist identification of plant genes involved in disease resistance.",

    "abstract": "MotivationInferring properties of biological sequences--such as determining the species-of-origin of a DNA sequence or the function of an amino-acid sequence--is a core task in many bioinformatics applications. These tasks are often solved using string-matching to map query sequences to labeled database sequences or via Hidden Markov Model-like pattern matching. In the current work we describe and assess an deep learning approach which trains a deep neural network (DNN) to predict database-derived labels directly from query sequences.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate this DNN performs at state-of-the-art or above levels on a difficult, practically important problem: predicting species-of-origin from short reads of 16S ribosomal DNA. When trained on 16S sequences of over 13,000 distinct species, our DNN achieves read-level species classification accuracy within 2.0% of perfect memorization of training data, and produces more accurate genus-level assignments for reads from held-out species than k-mer, alignment, and taxonomic binning baselines. Moreover, our models exhibit greater robustness than these existing approaches to increasing noise in the query sequences. Finally, we show that these DNNs perform well on experimental 16S mock community dataset. Overall, our results constitute a first step towards our long-term goal of developing a general-purpose deep learning approach to predicting meaningful labels from short biological sequences.\n\nAvailabilityTensorFlow training code is available through GitHub (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research).

Recent behavioral and patient studies have challenged the classic notion that motor learning arises solely from the errors produced during a task, suggesting instead that explicit cognitive strategies can act in concert with the implicit, error\\\"based, motor learning component. Here, we show that the earliest wave of directionally-tuned neuromuscular activity that occurs within ~100 ms of peripheral visual stimulus onset is selectively influenced by the implicit component of motor learning. In contrast, the voluntary neuromuscular activity associated with reach initiation, which evolves ~100 to 200 ms later is influenced by both the implicit and explicit components of motor learning. The selective influence of the implicit, but not explicit, component of motor learning on the earliest cascade of neuromuscular activity supports the notion that these components of motor learning can differentially influence descending motor pathways.",

In tests based on promoter capture Hi-C data, DeepTACT is seen to offer improved resolution over existing methods. DeepTACT analysis also identifies a class of hub promoters, which are active across cell lines, enriched in housekeeping genes, functionally related to fundamental biological processes, and capable of reflecting cell similarity.

    "abstract": "Daphnia and their parasites have emerged as a model system for understanding the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases. Two of the most commonly studied Daphnia parasites are the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa and the fungus Metschnikowia bicuspidata. In addition to being the focus of numerous field studies, these two parasites have been used in many laboratory experiments. However, there is little information in the scientific literature about how the conditions under which these parasites are stored influence the infectivity and yield of transmission stages (\\\"spores\\\"). This is problematic because such information is critical for experiment design and data interpretation.\\n\\nWe tested the influence of storage length (eight treatments ranging from 1 day to 1 year) and temperature (-20{degrees}C (freezer) vs. 4{degrees}C (refrigerator)) on spore infectivity and yield. We found that Pasteuria spores survived well at both -20{degrees}C and 4{degrees}C, and remained infective even after storage for one year. However, Pasteuria spore yields dropped over time, particularly at 4{degrees}C. In contrast, Metschnikowia spores were killed within days at -20{degrees}C. At 4{degrees}C, Metschnikowia infectivity declined steadily over a period of two months and, by four months, spores were no longer infective. Spore yield from Metschnikowia-infected hosts was not significantly impacted by storage length, but trended downwards.\\n\\nScientists working with Pasteuria should be aware that spore yield declines during storage, particularly in the refrigerator. Scientists working with Metschnikowia should be aware that it is killed by freezer storage and that, even if it is stored in the refrigerator, infectivity declines within a few months. These results might have implications for parasite distributions in the field; for example, the high sensitivity of Metschnikowia to freezing might help explain why it tends to be more common in deep lakes than in ponds or rock pools.",

    "abstract": "Recently diverged taxa showing marked phenotypic and ecological diversity are optimal systems to test the relative importance of two major evolutionary mechanisms, adaptation to local ecological conditions by natural selection, or mechanisms of reproductive isolation such as assortative mating mediated by sexually selected mating signals or post-zygotic incompatibilities. Whereas local adaptation is expected to affect many loci throughout the genome, traits acting as mating signals are expected to be located on sex chromosomes and have a simple genetic basis. We used genome-wide markers to test these predictions in Reunion Islands gray-white eye (Zosterops borbonicus), which has recently diversified into five distinct plumage forms. Two of them correspond to a polymorphic highland population that is separated by a steep ecological gradient from three distinct lowland forms that show narrow contact zones in plumage color traits, yet no association with environmental variables. An analysis of population structure using genome-wide SNP loci revealed two major clades corresponding to highland and lowland forms, respectively, with the latter separated further into three independent lineages corresponding to plumage forms. Coalescent tests of alternative demographic scenarios provided support for divergence of highland and lowland lineages with an intensification of gene flow in the last 60,000 years. Landscapes of genomic variation revealed that signatures of selection associated with elevation are found at multiple regions across the genome, whereas most loci associated with the lowland forms are located on the Z sex chromosome. A gene ontology analysis identified TYRP1, a Z-linked color gene, as a likely candidate locus underlying color variation among lowland forms. Our results are consistent with the role of natural selection in driving the divergence of locally adapted highland populations, and the role of sexual selection in differentiating lowland forms through reproductive isolation mechanisms, showing that both modes of lineage divergence can take place at very small geographic scales in birds.",

    "abstract": "The ability to adapt ones movements to changes in the environment is fundamental in everyday life, but this ability changes across the lifespan. Although often regarded as an  implicit process, recent research has also linked motor adaptation with  explicit learning processes. To understand how these processes contribute to differences in motor adaptation with age, we combined a visuomotor learning paradigm with cognitive tasks that measure implicit and explicit processes, and structural brain imaging. In a large population-based cohort from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (n=322, aged 18-89 years) we first confirmed that the degree of adaptation to an angular perturbation of visual feedback declined with age. There were no associations between adaptation and sensory attenuation, which has been previously hypothesised to contribute to implicit motor learning. However, interactions between age and scores on two independent memory tasks showed that explicit memory performance was a progressively stronger determinant of motor learning with age. Similarly, interactions between age and grey matter volume in the medial temporal lobe, amygdala and hippocampus showed that grey matter volume in these regions became a stronger determinant of adaptation in older adults. The convergent behavioural and structural imaging results suggest that age-related differences in the explicit memory system is a contributor to the decline in motor adaptation in older age. These results may reflect the more general compensatory reliance on cognitive strategies to maintain motor performance with age.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe central nervous system has a remarkable capacity to learn new motor skills and adapt to new environmental dynamics. This capacity is impaired with age, and in many brain disorders. We find that explicit memory performance and its associated medial temporal brain regions deteriorate with age, but the association between this brain system and individual differences in motor learning becomes stronger in older adults. We propose that these results reflect an increased reliance on cognition in order to maintain adaptive motor skill performance. This difference in learning strategy has implications for interventions to improve motor skills in older adults.",

    "abstract": "MotivationNon-invasive prenatal testing or NIPT is currently among the top researched topic in obstetric care. While the performance of the current state-of-the-art NIPT solutions achieve high sensitivity and specificity, they still struggle with a considerable number of samples that cannot be concluded with certainty. Such uninformative results are often subject to repeated blood sampling and re-analysis, usually after two weeks, and this period may cause a stress to the future mothers as well as increase the overall cost of the test.\\n\\nResultsWe propose a supplementary method to traditional z-scores to reduce the number of such uninformative calls. The method is based on a novel analysis of the length profile of circulating cell free DNA which compares the change in such profiles when random-based and length-based elimination of some fragments is performed. The proposed method is not as accurate as the standard z-score; however, our results suggest that combination of these two independent methods correctly resolves a substantial portion of healthy samples with an uninformative result. Additionally, we discuss how the proposed method can be used to identify maternal aberrations, thus reducing the risk of false positive and false negative calls.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationA particular implementation of the proposed methods is not provided with the manuscript.\\n\\nContactCorrespondence regarding the manuscript should be directed at Frantisek Duris (fduris@dcs.fmph.uniba.sk).\\n\\nSupplementary InformationNo additional supplementary information is available.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule minus-end-directed motor that transports numerous intracellular cargoes. Mammalian dynein transport is initiated by coiled-coil adaptor proteins that 1) join dynein and its co-factor dynactin into a complex capable of processive motility, and 2) interact with a cargo-bound receptor, which is frequently a Rab GTPase on an organelle. Here, we report two novel dynein adaptors, CRACR2a and Rab45, which have a coiled-coil adaptor domain, a pair of EF hands, and a Rab GTPase domain fused into a single polypeptide. We find that CRACR2a-mediated dynein-dynactin motility is activated by calcium in vitro and in cells. In activated T cells, CRACR2a localizes to clathrin-independent endosomes that require microtubule-based transport to detach from the actin cortex and travel towards the microtubule organizing center. Together these results represent the first known examples of Rab GTPases that directly act as dynein adaptors and implicate CRACR2a-dynein in regulation of endocytic trafficking in T cells.",
