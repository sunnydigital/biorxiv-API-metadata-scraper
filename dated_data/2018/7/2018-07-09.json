    "abstract": "The integumentary (i.e., skin) and gustatory systems both function to protect the human body and are a first point of contact with poisons and pathogens. These systems may share a similar protective mechanism because both human taste and skin cells express mRNA for bitter  taste receptors (TAS2Rs). Here, we used gene-specific methods to measure mRNA from all known bitter receptor genes in adult human skin from freshly biopsied samples and from samples collected at autopsy from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. Human skin expressed some but not all TAS2Rs, and for those that were expressed, the relative amounts differed markedly among individuals. For some TAS2Rs, mRNA abundance was related to sun exposure (TAS2R14, TAS2R30, TAS2R42, and TAS2R60), sex (TAS2R3, TAS2R4, TAS2R8, TAS2R9, TAS2R14, and TAS2R60), and age (TAS2R5), although these effects were not large. These findings contribute to our understanding of extraoral expression of chemosensory receptors.",

    "abstract": "Axonal regeneration in the mature CNS is limited by extracellular inhibitory factors. Triple knockout mice lacking the major myelin-associated inhibitors do not display spontaneous regeneration after injury, indicating the presence of other inhibitors. Searching for such inhibitors we have detected elevated levels of histone H3 in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 24 hours after spinal cord injury. Following dorsal column lesions in mice and optic nerve crushes in rats, elevated levels of extracellular histone H3 were detected at the injury site. Similar to myelin-associated inhibitors, these extracellular histones induced growth cone collapse and inhibited neurite outgrowth. Histones mediate inhibition through the transcription factor YB-1 and Toll-like receptor 2, and these effects are independent of the Nogo receptor. Histone-mediated inhibition can be reversed by the addition of activated protein C (APC) in vitro, and APC treatment promotes axonal regeneration in the crushed optic nerve in vivo. These findings identify extracellular histones as a new class of nerve regeneration-inhibiting molecules within the injured CNS.\n\nOne sentence summaryProteins typically associated with chromatin structure play an unexpected role in limiting axonal regeneration after injury.",

    "abstract": "Depressive Rumination (DR), which involves a repetitive focus on ones distress, has been linked to alterations in functional connectivity of the  triple-network, consisting of Default-Mode, Salience, and Executive Control networks. A structural basis for these functional alterations that can dually explain DRs persistence as a stable trait remains unexplored, however. Using diffusion and functional MRI, we investigated multimodal relationships between DR severity, white-matter (WM) microstructure, and resting-state functional connectivity in depressed adults, and then directly replicated our results in a phenotypically-matched, independent sample (total N = 78). Among the fully-replicated findings, DR severity was associated with: (a) global microstructure of the right Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus and local microstructure of distributed primary-fiber and crossing-fiber WM; (b) a functional connectivity imbalance of segregation and integration within the triple-network; and (c)  multi-layer associations between these microstructural and functional connectivity biomarkers. Taken together, our results provide the first reproducible evidence for a multivariate microstructural-functional basis of rumination in the depressed brain.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo measure the pupil response to pulses of melanopsin-directed contrast, and compare this response to those evoked by cone-directed contrast and spectrally-narrowband stimuli.\\n\\nMethods3-second unipolar pulses were used to elicit pupil responses in human subjects across 3 sessions. Thirty subjects were studied in Session 1, and most returned for Sessions 2 and 3. The stimuli of primary interest were \\\"silent substitution\\\" cone- and melanopsin-directed modulations. Red and blue narrowband pulses delivered using the post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) paradigm were also studied. Sessions 1 and 2 were identical, while Session 3 involved modulations around higher radiance backgrounds. The pupil responses were fit by a model whose parameters described response amplitude and temporal shape.\\n\\nResultsGroup average pupil responses for all stimuli overlapped extensively across Sessions 1 and 2, indicating high reproducibility. Model fits indicate that the response to melanopsin-directed contrast is prolonged relative to that elicited by cone-directed contrast. The group average cone- and melanopsin-directed pupil responses from Session 3 were highly similar to those from Sessions 1 and 2, suggesting that these responses are insensitive to background radiance over the range studied. The increase in radiance enhanced persistent pupil constriction to blue light.\\n\\nConclusionsThe group average pupil response to stimuli designed through silent substitution provides a reliable probe of the function of a melanopsin-mediated system in humans. As disruption of the melanopsin system may relate to clinical pathology, the reproducibility of response suggests that silent substitution pupillometry can test if melanopsin signals differ between clinical groups.",

    "abstract": "Green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) is an outcrossing, diploid (2n=46) hardwood tree species, native to North America. Native ash species in North America are being threatened by the rapid invasion of emerald ash borer (EAB, Agrilus planipennis) from Asia. Green ash, the most widely distributed ash species, is severely affected by EAB infestation, yet few resources for genetic studies and improvement of green ash are available. In this study, a total of 5,712 high quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were discovered using a minimum allele frequency of 1% across the entire genome through genotyping-by-sequencing. We also screened hundreds of genomic- and EST-based microsatellite markers (SSRs) from previous de novo assemblies (Staton et al. 2015; Lane et al. 2016). A first genetic linkage map of green ash was constructed from 91 individuals in a full-sib family, combining 2,719 SNP and 84 SSR segregating markers among the parental maps. The consensus SNP and SSR map contains a total of 1,201 markers in 23 linkage groups spanning 2008.87cM, at an average inter-marker distance of 1.67 cM with a minimum logarithm of odds (LOD) of 6 and maximum recombination fraction of 0.40. Comparisons of the organization the green ash map with the genomes of asterid species coffee and tomato, and genomes of the rosid species poplar and peach, showed areas of conserved gene order, with overall synteny strongest with coffee.",
