    "abstract": "In Escherichia coli, the sigma factor {sigma}70 directs RNA polymerase to transcribe growth-related genes, while {sigma}38 directs transcription of stress response genes during stationary phase. Two molecules hypothesized to regulate RNA polymerase are the protein Rsd, which binds to {sigma}70, and the non-coding 6S RNA which binds to the RNA polymerase- {sigma}70 holoenzyme. Despite multiple studies, the functions of Rsd and 6S RNA remain controversial. Here we use RNA-Seq in five phases of growth to elucidate their function on a genome-wide scale. We show for the first time that Rsd and 6S RNA facilitate {sigma}38 activity throughout bacterial growth, while 6S RNA also regulates widely different genes depending upon growth phase. We discover novel interactions between 6S RNA and Rsd and show widespread expression changes in a strain lacking both regulators. Finally, we present a mathematical model of transcription which highlights the crosstalk between Rsd and 6S RNA as a crucial factor in controlling sigma factor competition and global gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Background: Genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9 technology allows large-scale screening of gene essentiality in cancer. A confounding factor when interpreting CRISPR-Cas9 screens is the high false-positive rate in detecting essential genes within copy number amplified regions of the genome. We have developed the computational tool CRISPRcleanR which is capable of identifying and correcting gene-independent responses to CRISPR-Cas9 targeting. CRISPRcleanR uses an unsupervised approach based on the segmentation of single-guide RNA fold change values across the genome, without making any assumption about the copy number status of the targeted genes.\\n\\nResults Applying our method to existing and newly generated genome-wide essentiality profiles from 15 cancer cell lines, we demonstrate that CRISPRcleanR reduces false positives when calling essential genes, correcting biases within and outside of amplified regions, while maintaining true positive rates. Established cancer dependencies and essentiality signals of amplified cancer driver genes are detectable post-correction. CRISPRcleanR reports sgRNA fold changes and normalised read counts, is therefore compatible with downstream analysis tools, and works with multiple sgRNA libraries.\\n\\nConclusions CRISPRcleanR is a versatile open-source tool for the analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens to identify essential genes.",

    "abstract": "Mitosis encompasses key molecular changes including chromatin condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and reduced transcription levels. Immediately after mitosis, the interphase chromatin structure is reestablished and transcription resumes. The reestablishment of the interphase chromatin is probably achieved by  bookmarking, i.e., the retention of at least partial information during mitosis. Yet, while recent studies demonstrate that chromatin accessibility is generally preserved during mitosis and is only locally modulated, the exact details of the bookmarking process and its components are still unclear. To gain a deeper understanding of the mitotic bookmarking process, we merged proteomics, immunofluorescence, and ChIP-seq approaches to study the mitotic and interphase genomic organization of human cells. We focused on key histone modifications and employed HeLa-S3 cells as a model system. Generally, we observed a global concordance between the genomic organization of histone modifications in interphase and mitosis, yet the abundance of the two types of modifications we investigated was different. Whereas histone methylation patterns remain highly similar, histone acetylation patterns show a general reduction while maintaining their genomic organization. These results demonstrate that the epigenomic landscape can serve as a major component of the mitotic bookmarking process. Next, to further investigate mitosis-associated chromatin changes, we followed up on previous studies that showed that nucleosome depleted regions (NDRs) become occupied by a nucleosome during mitosis. Surprisingly, we observed that the nucleosome introduced into the NDR during mitosis encompasses a distinctive set of histone modifications, differentiating it from the surrounding nucleosomes. We show that the nucleosomes near the NDR appear to both shift into the NDR during mitosis and adopt a unique modification pattern. HDAC inhibition by the small molecule TSA reverts this pattern. These results provide evidence for a mitotic deposition and change in the modifications of the nucleosomes surrounding the NDR. Altogether, by merging multiple approaches, our study provides evidence to support a model where mitotic bookmarking is achieved by histone modifications and uncovers new insights into the deposition of nucleosomes during mitosis.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesWe know little about human olfactory ability in natural settings because current knowledge derives from lab-based studies using non-representative samples of convenience. The primary objective was to use a validated lab tool, the five-item odor identification test, to assess variation in olfactory ability in different environments.\n\nMethodsUsing the five-item test, we conducted two repeated measures experiments that assessed participant ability to correctly identify an odor source in different odor environments. We also examined consistency in odor labelling due to documented potential bias from idiosyncrasies in odor terms.\n\nResultsWe found no variation in olfactory ability due to environment, but this may be due to methodological biases. First, subjective bias results from idiosyncratic differences in participant labelling and researcher coding of answer correctness. Second, better ability to learn odors may provide an advantage to women. Third, reducing positive female learning bias by analyzing consistency in response (regardless of correct odor source identification) fails to assess functional olfactory ability. Functional olfactory ability (naming correct odor source) is significantly better in females, especially in food-rich odor environments.\n\nConclusionsEnvironment was not a significant factor in olfactory ability in this study but that result may be confounded by methodological biases. We not recommend odor identification as a field tool. Functional olfactory ability exhibits a sex-based pattern but consistency in recognizing the same odor does not. Food-rich odors may enhance olfactory ability in females. We discuss evolutionary and ecological implications of superior female functional olfactory ability relative to food foraging activity.",

    "abstract": "Premise of the studyBasic wood density is an important ecological trait for woody plants. It is used to characterize species performance and fitness in community ecology, and to compute tree and forest biomass in carbon cycle studies. While wood density has been historically measured at 12% moisture, it is convenient for ecological purposes to convert this measure to basic wood density, i.e. the ratio of dry mass over green volume. Basic wood density can then be used to compute tree dry biomass from living tree volume.\\n\\nMethodsHere, we derive a new, exact formula to compute the basic wood density Db from the density at moisture content w denoted Dw, the fibre saturation point S, and the volumetric shrinkage coefficient R. We estimated a new conversion factor using a global wood technology database where values to use this formula are available for 4022 trees collected in 64 countries (mostly tropical) and representing 872 species.\\n\\nKey resultsWe show that previous conversion factors used to convert densities at 12% moisture into basic wood densities are inconsistent. Based on theory and data, we found that basic wood density could be inferred from the density at 12% moisture using the following formula: Db = 0.828D122. This value of 0.828 provides basic wood density estimates 4-5% smaller than values inferred from previous conversion factors.\\n\\nConclusionsThis new conversion factor should be used to derive basic wood densities in global wood density databases. This would prevent overestimating global forest carbon stocks and allow predicting better tree species community dynamics from wood density.",

    "abstract": "Excitation in neural circuits must be carefully controlled by inhibition to regulate information processing and network excitability. During development, cortical inhibitory and excitatory inputs are initially mismatched but become co-tuned or  balanced with experience. However, little is known about how excitatory-inhibitory balance is defined at most synapses, or the mechanisms for establishing or maintaining this balance at specific set-points. Here we show how coordinated long-term plasticity calibrates populations of excitatory/inhibitory inputs onto mouse auditory cortical pyramidal neurons. Pairing pre- and postsynaptic activity induced plasticity at paired inputs and different forms of heterosynaptic plasticity at the strongest unpaired synapses, which required minutes of activity and dendritic Ca2+ signaling to be computed. Theoretical analyses demonstrated how the relative rate of heterosynaptic plasticity could normalize and stabilize synaptic strengths to achieve any possible excitatory-inhibitory correlation. Thus excitatory-inhibitory balance is dynamic and cell-specific, determined by distinct plasticity rules across multiple excitatory and inhibitory synapses.",

    "abstract": "Cell wall glycopolymers on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria are fundamental to bacterial physiology and infection biology. These structures have also gained interest as vaccine antigens, in particular for the human pathogens Group A Streptococcus (GAS) and Streptococcus mutans. Streptococcal cell wall glycopolymers are considered to be functional homologues of wall teichoic acids but surprisingly lack the biologically-relevant and characteristic anionic charge. Here we identify gacH, a gene of unknown function in the GAS Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) biosynthetic cluster, in two independent transposon library screens for its ability to confer resistance to zinc and susceptibility to the bactericidal enzyme human group IIA secreted phospholipase A2. To understand the underlying mechanism of these phenotypes, we determined the structure of the extracellular domain of GacH and discover that it represents a new family of glycerol phosphate (GroP) transferases. Importantly, we demonstrate the presence of GroP in both the GAC and the homologous Serotype c Carbohydrate (SCC) from S. mutans, which is conferred by gacH and sccH products, respectively. NMR analysis of GAC released from cell wall by non-destructive methods reveals that approximately 30% of the GAC GlcNAc side-chains are modified by GroP at the C6 hydroxyl group. This previously unrecognized structural modification impacts host-pathogen interaction and has implications for vaccine design.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/337519v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6d7598org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@435695org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e9515corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dc78b7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Hematological parameters, serum protein electrophoresis parameters and hepatic transaminases level (SGOT-SGPT) were all measured in both control group rats (N=6) and diabetic group rats (N=6) and comparison between two groups was performed.\\n\\nMaterial and MethodSingle dose intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg dose of streptozotocin(STZ) in male adult wistar rats, induces extensive necrosis in langerhans {beta}-cell islets, because of its cytotoxicity. Experimental diabetes mellitus can be induced completely in less than 72 hours after STZ intraperitoneal injection. Streptozotocin(STZ) was purchased from Sigma company. Diabetic and control group rats were kept separately in different metabolic cages, and their blood glucose(BG), hematological parameters, serum protein electrophoretic pattern and hepatic transaminases level were analyzed and comparison was done.\\n\\nResultsIn our investigation, Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus(IDDM) was completely induced one week after single intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg BW. Diabetes mellitus induction was verified by measuring fasting plasma glucose level in blood samples of rats. Level of blood glucose, hematological parameters, serum protein electrophoretic pattern and hepatic transaminase enzymes level, were all measured. In diabetic group rats level of blood glucose (BG), hepatic transaminase enzymes (SGOT & SGPT), serum 1-globulin and {beta}-globulin were significantly increased but in albumin, albumin/globulin ratio (A/G ratio) and serum 2-globulin a significant decrease was observed in diabetic rats in comparison with normal rats.\\n\\nConclusionExtensive inflammation and tissue necrosis induced following diabetes mellitus induction in rats. Significant alterations were observed in serum protein electrophoresis fractions and hepatic transaminase enzymes level due to streptozotocin cytotoxic impacts on some tissues specifically liver.\\n\\nBecause of extensive {beta}-cells necrosis and degeneration caused by streptozotocin exposure, high level of blood glucose(diabetic hyperglycemia) was observed in diabetic rats. This type of experimentally induced diabetes mellitus would highly affect hematological parameters. Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus induced by streptozotocin, can lead to anemia, neutrophilia and lymphocytosis and also has decreasing effects on red blood cell indices (HGB, MCV, MCH, MCHC) in diabetic group rats.",

While there has been substantial success in using CRISPR/Cas9 in C. elegans, there has been little emphasis on optimizing the method for generating large insertions/deletions in this organism. To enhance the efficiency of using CRISPR/Cas9 to generate gene knockouts in C. elegans we have developed an online species-specific guide RNA selection tool (http://genome.sfu.ca/crispr). When coupled with previously developed selection vectors, optimization for homology arm length, and the use of purified Cas9 protein, we demonstrate a robust, efficient and effective protocol for generating deletions. Debate and speculation in the larger scientific community about off- target effects due to non-specific Cas9 cutting has prompted us to investigate through whole genome sequencing the occurrence of single nucleotide variants and indels accompanying targeted deletions. We did not detect any off-site variants above the natural spontaneous mutation rate and therefore conclude this modified protocol does not generate off-target events to any significant degree in C. elegans.",

Antisense transcription of the lncRNA through the sense promoter results in its activation and in DNA demethylation of the binding sites for the CCCTC-binding protein, CTCF, located in close proximity to both sense and antisense promoters. Increased CTCF binding promotes the assembly of long-range DNA contacts between the activated promoter and a neuron-specific enhancer, thus locking in the epigenetic state of the stochastically chosen Pcdh promoter. Examination of this hierarchical molecular mechanism in differentiating olfactory sensory neurons, suggests that antisense Pcdh transcription is a key prerequisite for stochastic Pcdh promoter choice in vivo.",

    "abstract": "DEET (N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) is the most effective and broadly used insect repellent, but its mechanism of action is both complex and controversial [1]. Previous work demonstrated that DEET acts both on insect smell [2-6] and taste [7-11] systems. Its olfactory mode of action requires the odorant co-receptor orco [2, 3, 6], while its gustatory repellency is mediated by activation of bitter taste receptors and neurons in the proboscis upon ingestion [8]. Together, these data have led to the assumption that DEET acts only on olfactory and gustatory pathways. We previously observed that orco mutant female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are strongly attracted to humans even in the presence of DEET, but are rapidly repelled after contacting DEET-treated skin [6]. To understand the basis of this contact chemorepellency, we carried out a series of behavioral experiments and discovered that DEET acts in three distinct ways: through smell, taste, and contact. DEET and bitter tastants are feeding deterrents when ingested, but only DEET is capable of mediating contact repellency on human skin. We show that the repellent touch of DEET is mediated by the tarsal segments of the legs, and not gustatory neurons in the proboscis as previously believed. This work establishes mosquito leg appendages as the actual sensors of DEET, and highlights the existence of an unknown sensory pathway that is independent of bitter taste. These results will inform the search for novel contact-based insect repellents.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDEET and bitters are both repellent when ingested by Aedes aegypti female mosquitoes\\nC_LIO_LIOnly DEET is additionally repellent upon contact\\nC_LIO_LIRepellency of DEET on skin is mediated solely by the legs\\nC_LIO_LIAny of the three pairs of legs can sense DEET and prevent mosquitoes from biting\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The spatial distribution of binding and fusion proteins on most viruses and the functional relevance of this organization remains largely unexplored. Employing super-resolution microscopy we define the nanoscale membrane architecture of the prototypic poxvirus, vaccinia. We show that binding and entry fusion complex (EFC) proteins are organized into distinct functional domains with fusion proteins polarized to the tips of virions. Repression of individual EFC components disrupted fusion protein polarization, correlating with a loss of fusion activity. Repression of vaccinia A27, a non-EFC protein implicated in fusion, revealed that disruption of EFC localization impacts virus fusion pore formation. We propose that the polarized distribution of EFCs is essential for poxvirus fusion efficiency.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9 has become a powerful tool for genome editing in zebrafish that permits the rapid generation of loss of function mutations and the knock-in of specific alleles using DNA templates and homology directed repair (HDR). We compared synthetic, chemically modified sgRNAs to in vitro transcribed sgRNAs and demonstrate the increased activity of synthetic sgRNAs in combination with recombinant Cas9 protein. We developed an in vivo genetic assay to measure HDR efficiency and we utilized this assay to optimize the design of synthetic DNA templates to promote HDR. Utilizing these principles, we successfully performed knock-in of fluorophores at multiple genomic loci and demonstrate transmission through the germline at high efficiency. We demonstrate that synthetic HDR templates can be used to knock-in bacterial nitroreductase (ntr) to facilitate lineage ablation of specific cell types. Collectively, our data demonstrate the utility of combining synthetic sgRNAs and dsDNA templates to perform homology directed repair and genome editing in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Tight junctions prevent the paracellular flow and maintain cell polarity in an epithelium. These are also essential for maintaining the blood-testis-barrier involved in regulating sperm differentiation. Septate junctions are orthologous to the tight junctions in insects. In Drosophila testis, major septate junction components co-localize at the interface of germline and somatic cells initially and then condense between the two somatic cells in a cyst after germline meiosis. Their localization is extensively remodeled in subsequent stages. We find that characteristic septate junctions are formed between the somatic cyst cells at the elongated spermatid stage. Consistent with the previous reports, knockdown of essential junctional components, Discs-large-1 and Neurexin-IV, in the somatic cyst cells, during the early stages, disrupted sperm differentiation beyond the spermatocyte stage. Somatic knockdown of these proteins during the final stages of spermatid maturation caused premature release of spermatids inside the testes, resulting in partial loss of male fertility. These results indicate the importance of maintaining mechanical integrity of the somatic enclosure during spermatid coiling and release in Drosophila testis. It also highlights the functional similarity with the tight junction proteins during spermatogenesis in mammalian testes.\\n\\nSummary statementDubey et al., showed that septate junctions stitch the somatic enclosure around maturing spermatids in Drosophila testis. Maintaining the integrity of this junction is essential for proper release of spermatids.",

    "abstract": "Studies of lab strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have uncovered signaling pathways involved in mating, including information processing strategies to optimize decisions to mate or to bud. However, lab strains are heterothallic (unable to self-mate) while wild yeast are homothallic. And while mating of lab strains is studied using cycling haploid cells, mating of wild yeast is thought to involve germinating spores. Thus, it was unclear whether lab strategies would be appropriate in the wild. Here, we have investigated the behaviors of several yeast strains derived from wild isolates. Following germination, these strains displayed large differences in their propensity to mate or to enter the cell cycle. The variable interest in sex following germination was correlated with differences in pheromone production, which were due to both cis- and trans-acting factors. Our findings suggest that yeast spores germinating in the wild may often enter the cell cycle and form microcolonies prior to engaging in mating.",

    "abstract": "Understanding why some groups of organisms are more diverse than others is a central goal in macroevolution. Evolvability, or lineages intrinsic capacity for evolutionary change, is thought to influence disparities in species diversity across taxa. Over macroevolutionary time scales, clades that exhibit high evolvability are expected to have higher speciation rates. Cone snails (family: Conidae, >900 spp.) provide a unique opportunity to test this prediction because their venom genes can be used to characterize differences in evolvability between clades. Cone snails are carnivorous, use prey-specific venom (conotoxins) to capture prey, and the genes that encode venom are known and diversify through gene duplication. Theory predicts that higher gene diversity confers a greater potential to generate novel phenotypes for specialization and adaptation. Therefore, if conotoxin gene diversity gives rise to varying levels of evolvability, conotoxin gene diversity should be coupled with macroevolutionary speciation rates. We applied exon capture techniques to recover phylogenetic markers and conotoxin loci across 314 species, the largest venom discovery effort in a single study. We paired a reconstructed timetree using 12 fossil calibrations with species-specific estimates of conotoxin gene diversity and used trait-dependent diversification methods to test the impact of evolvability on diversification patterns. Surprisingly, did not detect any signal for the relationship between conotoxin gene diversity and speciation rates, suggesting that venom evolution may not be the rate-limiting factor controlling diversification dynamics in Conidae. Comparative analyses showed some signal for the impact of diet and larval dispersal strategy on diversification patterns, though whether or not we detected a signal depended on the dataset and the method. If our results remain true with increased sampling in future studies, they suggest that the rapid evolution of Conidae venom may cause other factors to become more critical to diversification, such as ecological opportunity or traits that promote isolation among lineages.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease-based gene drives rely on inducing chromosomal breaks in the germline that are repaired in ways that lead to a biased inheritance of the drive. Gene drives designed to impair female fertility can suppress populations of the mosquito vector of malaria. However, strong unintended fitness costs, due to ectopic nuclease expression, and high levels of resistant mutations, limited the potential of the first generation of gene drives to spread.\n\nHere we show that changes to regulatory sequences in the drive element, designed to contain nuclease expression to the germline, confer improved fecundity over previous versions and generate drastically lower rates of target site resistance. We employed a genetic screen to show that this effect is explained by reduced rates of end-joining repair of DNA breaks at the target site caused by deposited nuclease in the embryo.\n\nHighlighting the impact of deposited Cas9, many of the mutations arising from this source of nuclease activity in the embryo are heritable, thereby having the potential to generate resistant target sites that reduce the penetrance of the gene drive.\n\nFinally, in cage invasion experiments these gene drives show improved invasion dynamics compared to first generation drives, resulting in greater than 90% suppression of the reproductive output and a delay in the emergence of target site resistance, even at a resistance-prone target sequence. We shed light on the dynamics of generation and selection of resistant alleles in a population by tracking, longitudinally, the frequency of resistant alleles in the face of an invading gene drive. Our results illustrate important considerations for future gene drive design and should expedite the development of gene drives robust to resistance.",
