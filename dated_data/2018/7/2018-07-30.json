    "abstract": "One-sentence summaryInsulin inhibits ATP release in adipocytes\\n\\nAbstractExtracellular ATP signaling is involved in many physiological and pathophysiological processes, and purinergic receptors are targets for drug therapy in several diseases, including obesity and diabetes. Adipose tissue has crucial functions in lipid and glucose metabolism and adipocytes express purinergic receptors. However, the sources of extracellular ATP in adipose tissue are not yet characterized.\\n\\nHere, we show that upon adrenergic stimulation white adipocytes release ATP through the pannexin-1 pore that is regulated by a cAMP-PKA dependent pathway. The ATP release correlates with increased cell metabolism, and extracellular ATP induces Ca2+ signaling and lipolysis in adipocytes and promotes macrophages migration. Most importantly, ATP release is markedly inhibited by insulin, and thereby auto/paracrine purinergic signaling in adipose tissue would be attenuated. Furthermore, we define the signaling pathway for insulin regulated ATP release.\\n\\nOur findings reveal the insulin-pannexin-1-purinergic signaling cross-talk in adipose tissue and we propose that deregulation of this signaling may underlie adipose tissue inflammation and type-2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a powerful tool to determine precise expression patterns of tens of thousands of individual cells, decipher cell heterogeneity and cell subpopulations and so on. However, scRNA-seq data analysis remains challenging due to various technical noise, e.g., the presence of dropout events (i.e., excess zero counts). Taking account of cell heterogeneity and structural effect of expression on dropout rate, we propose a novel method named PBLR to accurately impute the dropouts of scRNA-seq data. PBLR is an effective tool to recover dropout events on both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets, and can dramatically improve low-dimensional representation and recovery of gene-gene relationship masked by dropout events compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, PBLR also detect accurate and robust cell subpopulations automatically, shedding light its flexibility and generality for scRNA-seq data analysis.",

    "abstract": "The use of antiretrovirals (ARVs) has drastically improved the life quality and expectancy of HIV patients since their introduction in health care. Several millions are still afflicted worldwide by HIV and ARV resistance is a constant concern for both healthcare practitioners and patients, as while treatment options are finite, the virus constantly adapts and selects for resistant viral strains under the pressure of drug treatment. The HIV protease is a crucial enzyme that processes viral polyproteins into their functional form, and has been a game changing drug target since the first application. Due to similarities in protease inhibitor designs, drug cross-resistance is not uncommon across ARVs of the same class. It is known that resistance against protease inhibitors is associated with a wider active site, but results from our large scale molecular dynamics analysis further show, for the first time, that there are regions of local expansions and compactions associated with high levels of resistance conserved across eight different protease inhibitors visible in their complexed form in closed receptor conformations. The method developed here is novel, supplementary to the methods of nonsynonymous mutation analysis, and should be applicable in analyzing the structural consequences of mutations in other contexts.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe protein data bank (PDB) currently holds over 140,000 biomolecular structures and continues to release new structures on a weekly basis. The PDB is an essential resource to the structural bioinformatics community to develop software that mine, use, categorize, and analyze such data. New computational biology methods are evaluated using custom benchmarking sets derived as subsets of 3D experimentally determined structures and structural features from the PDB. Currently, such benchmarking features are manually curated with custom scripts in a non-standardized manner that results in slow distribution and updates with new experimental structures. Finally, there is a scarcity of standardized tools to rapidly query 3D descriptors of the entire PDB.\n\nApproachOur solution is the Lemon framework, a C++11 library with Python bindings, which provides a consistent workflow methodology for selecting biomolecular interactions based on user criterion and computing desired 3D structural features. This framework can parse and characterize the entire PDB in less than ten minutes on modern, multithreaded hardware. The speed in parsing is obtained by using the recently developed MacroMolecule Transmission Format (MMTF) to reduce the computational cost of reading text-based PDB files. The use of C++ lambda functions and Python binds provide extensive flexibility for analysis and categorization of the PDB by allowing the user to write custom functions to suite their objective. We think Lemon will become a one-stop-shop to quickly mine the entire PDB to generate desired structural biology features. The Lemon software is available as a C++ header library along with example functions at https://github.com/chopralab/lemon.",

    "abstract": "Maturity is one of the important traits of potato. In order to get the genetic segment of potato early maturity trait, a tetraploid potato maturity segregation population of Zhongshu 19 x Zhongshu 3 was used for genetic analysis through the combination of high throughput simplified genome sequencing (2b-RAD) and bulked segregation analysis (BSA). A genetic segment related to the early maturity trait at the 3.7~4.2 Mb locus on the short arm of chromosome 5 was obtained and eight markers were developed based on this segment, while five of them were closely linked to the early maturity trait loci. Moreover, 42 SSR markers were developed based on the reference sequence of DM. Finally, a genetic map of chromosome 5 contained 50 markers was constructed using the Tetraploidmap software. The total map length was 172 cM with an average genetic distance of 3.44 cM. Combining with phenotypic data of the segregation population, we mapped the early maturity trait QTL with the contribution of 33.55% on the short arm of chromosome 5, located at 84cM between the flanking markers SSR5-85-1 and SCAR5-8 with the physical interval of 471kb. Gene annotation showed that there exist 34 genes in this region, 12 of them are unknown function. Among the other 22 annotated genes, E3 ubiquitin ligase gene PUB14 may be related to maturity and regulate tuber formation.

    "abstract": "Insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) regulates essential processes including development, metabolism, and aging. The Drosophila genome encodes eight insulin/IGF-like peptide (dilp) paralogs, including tandem-encoded dilp1 and dilp2. Many reports show that longevity is increased by manipulations that decrease DILP2 in adults. In contrast, dilp1 is expressed primarily in pupal stages, but also during adult reproductive diapause, although we find that dilp1 is also highly expressed in adult dilp2 mutants under non-diapause conditions. The inverse expression of dilp1 and dilp2 suggests these genes interact to regulate aging. Here, we study dilp1 and dilp2 single and double mutants to describe epistatic and synergistic interactions affecting longevity, metabolism and adipokinetic hormone (AKH), a functional homolog of glucagon. Mutants of dilp2 extend lifespan and increase Akh mRNA and protein in a dilp1-dependent manner. Loss of dilp1 alone has no impact on these traits, whereas transgene expression of dilp1 increases lifespan in dilp1-dilp2 double mutants. On the other hand, dilp1 and dilp2 redundantly interact to control circulating sugar, starvation resistance and compensatory dilp5 expression. These later interactions do not correlate with patterns for how dilp1 and dilp2 affect longevity and AKH. Thus, repression or loss of dilp2 slows aging because its depletion induces dilp1, which acts as a pro-longevity factor. Likewise, dilp2 regulates Akh through epistatic interaction with dilp1. Akh and glycogen affect aging in C. elegans and Drosophila, suggesting that dilp2 modulates lifespan via dilp1 and in part by regulating Akh. Whether DILP1 acts as an insulin receptor agonist or inhibitor remains to be resolved.",

MB requires neurotransmission for an efficient flow of information across synapses with the different flexibility to meet the demand of the dynamically changing environment of an insect.

Till date, there is no transporter reported for any of the previously known neurotransmitters in the intrinsic neurons of MB. In this study, we report a highly enriched expression of Choline Transporter (ChT) in Drosophila MB. We demonstrate that knockdown of ChT in a sub-type of MB neurons called /{beta} core (/{beta}c) neurons leads to eclosion failure, peristaltic defect in larvae, and altered NMJ phenotype. These defects were neither observed on knockdown of proteins of the cholinergic locus in /{beta}c neurons nor by knockdown of ChT in cholinergic neurons. Thus, our study provides insights into non-canonical roles of ChT in MB.",

Type III effector complexes were recently demonstrated to synthesise a novel second messenger, cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA), on binding target RNA. cOA in turn binds to and activates a range of downstream effector proteins including ribonucleases (Csm6/Csx1) and transcription factors via a CARF (CRISPR associated Rossman Fold) domain, inducing an antiviral state in the cell that is important for immunity. The mechanism of the \\\"off-switch\\\" that resets the system is not understood. Here, we report the identification of the nuclease that degrades these cOA ring molecules. The \\\"Ring nuclease\\\" is itself a CARF family protein with a metal independent mechanism, which cleaves cOA4 rings to generate linear di-adenylate species and switches off the antiviral state. The identification of Ring nucleases adds an important insight to the CRISPR-Cas system.",

Here we describe a computational tool, termed Sibe, with a particular focus on protein sequence analysis, folding and design. Since Sibe has various easy-interface modules, expressive architecture and extensible codes, it is powerful in statistically analyzing sequence data and building energetic potentials in boosting both protein folding and design. In this study, Sibe is used to capture positionally conserved couplings between pairwise amino acids and help rational protein design, in which the pairwise couplings are filtered according to the relative entropy computed from the positional conservations and grouped into several  blocks. A human {beta}2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AR) was used to demonstrated that those  blocks could contribute rational design at functional residues. In addition, Sibe provides protein folding modules based on both the positionally conserved couplings and well-established statistical potentials. Sibe provides various easy to use command-line interfaces in C++ and/or Python. Sibe was developed for compatibility with the  big data era, and it primarily focuses on protein sequence analysis, in silico folding and design, but it is also applicable to extend for other modeling and predictions of experimental measurements.",

The connection between acquisition of drug resistance and invasive potential is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the type II keratin topological associating domain (TAD)3 undergoes epigenetic reprogramming in cells that develop resistance to aromatase inhibitors (AI), leading to keratin 80 (KRT80) upregulation. In agreement, an increased number of KRT80-positive cells are observed at relapse in vivo while KRT80 expression associates with poor outcome using several clinical endpoints. KRT80 expression is driven by de novo enhancer activation by sterol regulatory element-binding protein 14 (SREBP1). KRT80 upregulation directly promotes cytoskeletal rearrangements at the leading edge, increased focal adhesion maturation and cellular stiffening, which collectively promote cancer cell invasion. Shear-wave elasticity imaging of prospective patients shows that KRT80 levels correlate with stiffer tumors in vivo.

    "abstract": "Standard evolutionary theories of aging postulate that reduced extrinsic mortality leads to evolution of longevity. Clownfishes of the genus Amphiprion live in a symbiotic relationship with sea anemones that provide protection from predation. We performed a survey and identified at least two species with lifespan of over 20 years. Given their small size and ease of captive reproduction, clownfishes lend themselves as experimental models of exceptional longevity.\\n\\nTo identify genetic correlates of exceptional longevity, we sequenced the transcriptomes of Amphiprion percula and A. clarkii and performed a scan for positively-selected genes (PSGs). These were compared with PSGs detected in long-lived mole rats and short-lived killifishes revealing convergent evolution in processes such as mitochondrial biogenesis. Among individual genes, the Mitochondrial Transcription Termination Factor 1 (MTERF1), was positively-selected in all three clades, whereas the Glutathione S-Transferase Kappa 1 (GSTK1) was under positive selection in two independent clades. For the latter, homology modelling strongly suggested that positive selection targeted enzymatically important residues.\\n\\nThese results indicate that specific pathways were recruited in independent lineages evolving an exceptionally extended or shortened lifespan and point to mito-nuclear balance as a key factor.",

    "abstract": "Mapping genotype to phenotype is challenging because of the difficulties in identifying both the traits under selection and the specific genetic variants underlying these traits. Most of the current knowledge of the genetic basis of adaptive evolution is based on the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Despite increasing evidence for their causal role, the contribution of structural variants to adaptive evolution remains largely unexplored. In this work, we analyzed the population frequencies of 1,615 Transposable Element (TE) insertions in 91 samples from 60 worldwide natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We identified a set of 300 TEs that are present at high population frequencies, and located in genomic regions with high recombination rate, where the efficiency of natural selection is high. The age and the length of these 300 TEs are consistent with relatively young and long insertions reaching high frequencies due to the action of positive selection. Indeed, we, and others, found evidence of selective sweeps and/or population differentiation for 65 of them. The analysis of the genes located nearby these 65 candidate adaptive insertions suggested that the functional response to selection is related with the GO categories of response to stimulus, behavior, and development. We further showed that a subset of the candidate adaptive TEs affect expression of nearby genes, and five of them have already been linked to an ecologically relevant phenotypic effect. Our results provide a more complete understanding of the genetic variation and the fitness-related traits relevant for adaptive evolution. Similar studies should help uncover the importance of TE-induced adaptive mutations in other species as well.",

Researchers are currently leveraging genome-editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 to genetically engineer marmosets for the in vivo biomedical modeling of human neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. The genome characterization of these cell lines greatly reinforces these transgenic efforts. It also provides the genomic contexts required for the accurate interpretation of functional genomics data. We performed haplotype-resolved whole-genome characterization for marmoset ESC line cj367 from the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center. This is the first haplotype-resolved analysis of a marmoset genome and the first whole-genome characterization of any marmoset ESC line. We identified and phased single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and Indels across the genome. By leveraging this haplotype information, we then compiled a list of cj367 ESC allele-specific CRISPR targeting sites. Furthermore, we demonstrated successful Cas9 Endonuclease Dead (dCas9) expression and targeted localization in cj367 as well as sustained pluripotency after dCas9 transfection by teratoma assay.

    "abstract": "Wolbachia is an intracellular bacterium that infects a remarkable range of insect hosts. Insects such as mosquitos act as vectors for many devastating human viruses such as Dengue, West Nile, and Zika. Remarkably, Wolbachia infection provides insect hosts with resistance to many arboviruses thereby rendering the insects ineffective as vectors. To utilize Wolbachia effectively as a tool against vector-borne viruses a better understanding of the host-Wolbachia relationship is needed. To investigate Wolbachia-insect interactions we used the Wolbachia/Drosophila model that provides a genetically tractable system for studying host-pathogen interactions. We coupled genome-wide RNAi screening with a novel high-throughput fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay to detect changes in Wolbachia levels in a Wolbachia-infected Drosophila cell line JW18. 1117 genes altered Wolbachia levels when knocked down by RNAi of which 329 genes increased and 788 genes decreased the level of Wolbachia. Validation of hits included in depth secondary screening using in vitro RNAi, Drosophila mutants, and Wolbachia-detection by DNA qPCR. A diverse set of host gene networks was identified to regulate Wolbachia levels and unexpectedly revealed that perturbations of host translation components such as the ribosome and translation initiation factors results in increased Wolbachia levels both in vitro using RNAi and in vivo using mutants and a chemical-based translation inhibition assay. This work provides evidence for Wolbachia-host translation interaction and strengthens our general understanding of the Wolbachia-host intracellular relationship.\\n\\nAuthor summaryInsects such as mosquitos act as vectors to spread devastating human diseases such as Dengue, West Nile, and Zika. It is critical to develop control strategies to prevent the transmission of these diseases to human populations. A novel strategy takes advantage of an endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis. The presence of this bacterium in insect vectors prevents successful transmission of RNA viruses. The degree to which viruses are blocked by Wolbachia is dependent on the levels of the bacteria present in the host such that higher Wolbachia levels induce a stronger antiviral effect. In order to use Wolbachia as a tool against vector-borne virus transmission a better understanding of host influences on Wolbachia levels is needed. Here we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in a model host system Drosophila melanogaster infected with Wolbachia to identify host systems that affect Wolbachia levels. We found that host translation can influence Wolbachia levels in the host.",

    "abstract": "The maternally deposited transcription factor Zelda binds to and is required for the activation of a large number of genes in early Drosophila development, and has been suggested to act as a pioneer factor. In this study, we investigated the temporal dynamics of Zelda binding along with the maternal patterning factors Dorsal and Caudal during early embryogenesis. We found in regions bound by Zelda and either Dorsal or Caudal, Zelda binding was detected, and reached maximum levels, earlier than Caudal and Dorsal, providing support of its role as a pioneer factor. We found that Dorsal and Caudal binding correlated strongly with Zelda binding at mitotic cycle 12, suggesting that Zelda is important for early binding by these factors and early onset of their target gene expression. At the same time, we show that among Dorsal target enhancers, the dorsal and ventral ectoderm enhancers are much more strongly associated with Zelda than mesoderm enhancers, revealing an additional function of Zelda in coordinating spatial activity of enhancers. We have also investigated the role of Zelda on chromatin structure. We found that in early embryos, before Dorsal and Caudal are bound at significant levels, Zelda binding is associated with histone acetylation and local histone depletion. These chromatin associated changes accompanied with increased local chromatin accessibility were also detected around Zelda peaks in coding sequences that do not appear to play a role in subsequent transcription factor binding. These findings suggest that Zelda binding itself can lead to chromatin structural changes. Finally, we found that Zelda motifs, both bound and unbound, tend to be associated with positioned nucleosomes, which we suggest may be important for the regulatory specificity of enhancers.",

We define the CSHMM model and provide efficient learning and inference algorithms which allow the method to determine both the structure of the branching process and the assignment of cells to these branches. Analyzing several developmental single cell datasets we show that the CSHMM method accurately infers branching topology and correctly and continuously assign cells to paths, improving upon prior methods proposed for this task.

Here we present several novel Bayesian algorithms that estimate genotype posterior probabilities, all of which are implemented in a new R package, polyRAD. Appropriate priors can be specified for mapping populations, populations in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, or structured populations, and in each case can be informed by genotypes at linked markers.

Liquid cell transmission electron microscopy allows samples to remain in their native hydrated state and may permit visualizing cellular dynamics in-situ. However, imaging biological cells with this approach remains challenging and identifying an optimal imaging regime using empirical data would help foster new advancements in the field. Recent questions about the role of the electron beam inducing morphological changes or damaging cellular structure and function necessitates further investigation of electron beam-cell interactions, but is complicated by variability in imaging techniques used across various studies currently present in literature. The necessity for using low electron fluxes for imaging biological samples requires finding an imaging strategy which produces the strongest contrast and signal to noise ratio for the electron flux used. Here, we experimentally measure and evaluate signal to noise ratios and damage mechanisms between liquid and cryogenic samples for cells using multiple electron imaging modalities all on the same instrument and with equivalent beam parameters to standardize the comparison.

It also represents a distinctive lineage of sawflies that appeared early during the hymenopteran radiation, but after the clade of Eusymphyta sawflies that is the sister lineage of all other Hymenoptera. We present a high-quality draft genome assembly of 162 Mbp in 1,976 scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 622 kbp. Automated gene annotation identified 11,210 protein-coding gene models and 1,307 non-coding RNA models. Thirteen percent of the assembly consists of ~58,000 transposable elements partitioned equally between Class-I and Class-II elements. Orthology analysis reveals that 86% of Cephus proteins have identifiable orthologs in other insects. Phylogenomic analysis of conserved subsets of these proteins supports the placement of the Cephidae between the Eusymphyta and the parasitic woodwasp superfamily Orussoidea. Manual annotation and phylogenetic analysis of families of odorant, gustatory, and ionotropic receptors, plus odorant binding proteins, shows that Cephus has representatives for most conserved and expanded gene lineages in the Apocrita (wasps, ants, and bees). Cephus has also maintained several insect gene lineages that have been lost from the Apocrita, most prominently the carbon dioxide receptor subfamily. Furthermore, Cephus encodes a few small lineage-specific chemoreceptor gene family expansions that might be involved in adaptations to new grasses including wheat. These comparative analyses identify gene family members likely to have been present in the hymenopteran ancestor and provide a new perspective on the evolution of the chemosensory gene repertoire.",

The most widely used technique for studying connectivity changes over time utilizes a sliding windows approach. There has been some debate about the utility of shorter versus longer windows, the use of fixed versus adaptive windows, as well as whether observed resting state dynamics during wakefulness may be predominantly due to changes in sleep state and subject head motion. In this work we use an independent component analysis (ICA)-based pipeline applied to concurrent EEG/fMRI data collected during wakefulness and various sleep stages and show: 1) connectivity states obtained from clustering sliding windowed correlations of resting state functional network time courses well classify the sleep states obtained from EEG data, 2) using shorter sliding windows instead of longer non-overlapping windows improves the ability to capture transition dynamics even at windows as short as 30 seconds, 3) motion appears to be mostly associated with one of the states rather than spread across all of them 4) a fixed tapered sliding window approach outperforms an adaptive dynamic conditional correlation approach, and 5) consistent with prior EEG/fMRI work, we identify evidence of multiple states within the wakeful condition which are able to be classified with high accuracy. Classification of wakeful only states suggest the presence of time-varying changes in connectivity in fMRI data beyond sleep state or motion. Results also inform about advantageous technical choices, and the identification of different clusters within wakefulness that are separable suggest further studies in this direction.",

Through our eyes and skin, the activation patterns of sensory organs provide rich spatial cues. However, for other sensory dimensions, including sound localization and visual depth perception, spatial locations must be computed by the brain. For instance, interaural time differences (ITDs) of the sounds reaching the ears allow listeners to localize sound in the horizontal plane. Our experiments tested two prevalent theories on how ITDs affect human sound localization: 1) the labelled-line model, encoding space through tuned representations of spatial location; versus 2) the hemispheric-difference model, representing space through spike-rate distances relative to a perceptual anchor. Unlike the labelled-line model, the hemispheric-difference model predicts that with decreasing intensity, sound localization should collapse toward midline reference, and this is what we observed behaviorally. These findings cast doubt on models of human sound localization that rely on a spatially tuned map. Moreover, analogous experimental results in vision indicate that perceived depth depends upon the contrast of the target. Based on our findings, we propose that the brain uses a canonical computation of location across sensory modalities: perceived location is encoded through population spike rate relative to baseline.",

    "abstract": "Selective attention enables prioritizing the most important information for differential sensory processing and decision-making. Here, we address an active debate regarding whether attention reflects a unitary phenomenon or involves the operation of dissociable sensory enhancement (perceptual sensitivity) and decisional gating (choice bias) processes. We developed a multialternative task in which participants detected and localized orientation changes in gratings at one of four spatial locations. Exogenous attention cues (high contrast flashes) preceded or followed the change events in close temporal proximity. Analysis of participants behavior with a multidimensional signal detection model revealed markedly distinct effects of exogenous cueing on perceptual sensitivity and choice bias. Whereas sensitivity enhancement was localized to the stimulus proximal to the exogenous cue, bias enhancement occurred even for distal stimuli in the cued hemifield. Modulations of sensitivity and bias were uncorrelated at both cued and uncued locations. Finally, exogenous cueing produced reaction time benefits only at the cued location and costs only at locations contralateral to the cue. These disparate effects of exogenous cueing on sensitivity, bias and reaction times could be parsimoniously explained within the framework of a diffusion-decision model, in which the drift rate was determined by a linear combination of sensitivity and bias at each location. Exogenous cueing effects on sensitivity and bias differed systematically from previously reported effects of endogenous cueing. We propose that the search for shared neural substrates of exogenous and endogenous attention would benefit from investigating neural correlates of their component sensory and decisional mechanisms.\\n\\nSignificance statementWhen we voluntarily direct attention \\\"endogenously\\\", we are able to better perceive stimuli at the attended location (sensitivity), and to prioritize information from that location for guiding behavioral decisions (bias). But when a salient stimulus, such as a flash of lightning, captures our attention \\\"exogenously\\\", does it also produce these same effects? To answer this question, we designed a multiple alternative task in which task events occurred in close conjunction with salient exogenous cues (high contrast flashes). We discovered that exogenous attention enhanced both sensitivity and bias for cued stimuli, but each of these changes followed distinct spatial patterns across locations. Our results provide novel insights into component processes of exogenous attention and motivate the search for their neural correlates.",

    "abstract": "The quality of visual information that is available to an animal is limited by the size of its eyes. Differences in eye size can be observed even between closely related individuals but we understand little about how this affects visual quality. Insects are good models for exploring the effects of size on visual systems because many species exhibit size polymorphism, which modifies both the size and shape of their eyes. Previous work in this area has been limited, however, due to the challenge of determining the 3D structure of eyes. To address this, we have developed a novel method based on x-ray tomography to measure the 3D structure of insect eyes and calculate their visual capabilities. We investigated visual allometry in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris and found that size affects specific aspects of visual quality including binocular overlap, optical sensitivity across the field of view, and visual resolution in the dorsofrontal visual field. This holistic study on eye allometry reveals that differential scaling between different eye areas provides substantial flexibility for larger bumblebees to have improved visual capabilities.",
