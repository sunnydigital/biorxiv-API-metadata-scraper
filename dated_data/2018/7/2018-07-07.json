    "abstract": "The hundreds of cichlid fish species in Lake Malawi constitute the most extensive recent vertebrate adaptive radiation. Here we characterize its genomic diversity by sequencing 134 individuals covering 73 species across all major lineages. Average sequence divergence between species pairs is only 0.1-0.25%. These divergence values overlap diversity within species, with 82% of heterozygosity shared between species. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that diversification initially proceeded by serial branching from a generalist Astatotilapia-like ancestor. However, no single species tree adequately represents all species relationships, with evidence for substantial gene flow at multiple times. Common signatures of selection on visual and oxygen transport genes shared by distantly related deep water species point to both adaptive introgression and independent selection. These findings enhance our understanding of genomic processes underlying rapid species diversification, and provide a platform for future genetic analysis of the Malawi radiation.\\n\\nOne Sentence Summary: The genomes of 73 cichlid fish species from Lake Malawi uncover evolutionary processes underlying a large adaptive evolutionary radiation.",

    "abstract": "Despite widespread taxonomic representation, the function of gene body methylation (GBM) remains uncertain. One hypothesis is that GBM mediates phenotypic plasticity. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed whole-genome methylation and transcriptome profiling on reciprocally transplanted colony fragments of the reef-building coral Acropora millepora. GBM was only slightly affected by transplantation but these small changes correlated with coral fitness in the new environment. Specifically, for transplanted corals, similarity in GBM patterns to native corals positively correlated with growth rate, as well as carbohydrate, protein, lipid and endosymbiont content. Between populations, elevated GBM positively correlated with transcription, supporting previous findings that GBM is associated with stable and active transcription. Contrary to expectations however, changes in transcription as a result of transplantation did not correlate with changes in GBM and did not predict fitness. This indicates that on physiological time scales GBM is not directly coupled to transcription, leaving open the question about the mechanism linking GBM to fitness during acclimatization.",

In most legumes, rhizobia enter through infection-threads and nodule primordium in the cortex is induced from a distance. But in dalbergoid legumes like Arachis hypogaea, rhizobia directly invade cortical cells through epidermal cracks to generate the primordia. Herein we report the transcriptional dynamics with the progress of symbiosis in A. hypogaea at 1dpi: invasion; 4dpi: nodule primordia; 8dpi: spread of infection in nodule-like structure; 12dpi: immature nodules containing rod-shaped rhizobia; and 21dpi: mature nodules with spherical symbiosomes. Expression of putative orthologue of symbiotic genes in  crack-entry legume A. hypogaea was compared with infection thread adapted model legumes. The contrasting features were (i) higher expression of receptors like LYR3, EPR3 as compared to canonical NFRs (ii) late induction of transcription factors like NIN, NSP2 and constitutive high expression of ERF1, EIN2, bHLH476 and (iii) induction of divergent pathogenesis responsive PR-1 genes. Additionally, symbiotic orthologues of SymCRK, FLOT4, ROP6, RR9, NOOT and SEN1 were not detectable and microsynteny analysis indicated the absence of RPG and DNF2 homologues in diploid parental genomes of A. hypogaea.

    "abstract": "MotivationRegulatory proteins associate with the genome either by directly binding cognate DNA motifs or via protein-protein interactions with other regulators. Each recruitment mechanism may be associated with distinct motifs and may also result in distinct characteristic patterns in high-resolution protein-DNA binding assays. For example, the ChIP-exo protocol precisely characterizes protein-DNA crosslinking patterns by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with 5 [-&gt;] 3 exonuclease digestion. Since different regulatory complexes will result in different protein-DNA crosslinking signatures, analysis of ChIP-exo tag enrichment patterns should enable detection of multiple protein-DNA binding modes for a given regulatory protein. However, current ChIP-exo analysis methods either treat all binding events as being of a uniform type or rely on motifs to cluster binding events into subtypes.\\n\\nResultsTo systematically detect multiple protein-DNA interaction modes in a single ChIP-exo experiment, we introduce the ChIP-exo mixture model (ChExMix). ChExMix probabilistically models the genomic locations and subtype memberships of binding events using both ChIP-exo tag distribution patterns and DNA motifs. We demonstrate that ChExMix achieves accurate detection and classification of binding event subtypes using in silico mixed ChIP-exo data. We further demonstrate the unique analysis abilities of ChExMix using a collection of ChIP-exo experiments that profile the binding of key transcription factors in MCF-7 cells. In these data, ChExMix identifies possible recruitment mechanisms of FoxA1 and ER, thus demonstrating that ChExMix can effectively stratify ChIP-exo binding events into biologically meaningful subtypes.\\n\\nAvailabilityChExMix is available from https://github.com/seqcode/chexmix\\n\\nContactmahony@psu.edu",

    "abstract": "A gene drive biases the transmission of a particular allele of a gene such that it is inherited at a greater frequency than by random assortment. Recently, a highly efficient gene drive was developed in insects, which leverages the sequence-targeted DNA cleavage activity of CRISPR/Cas9 and endogenous homology directed repair mechanisms to convert heterozygous genotypes to homozygosity. If implemented in laboratory rodents, this powerful system would enable the rapid assembly of genotypes that involve multiple genes (e.g., to model multigenic human diseases). Such complex genetic models are currently precluded by time, cost, and a requirement for a large number of animals to obtain a few individuals of the desired genotype. However, the efficiency of a CRISPR/Cas9 gene drive system in mammals has not yet been determined. Here, we utilize an active genetic \\\"CopyCat\\\" element embedded in the mouse Tyrosinase gene to detect genotype conversions after Cas9 activity in the embryo and in the germline. Although Cas9 efficiently induces double strand DNA breaks in the early embryo and is therefore highly mutagenic, these breaks are not resolved by homology directed repair. However, when Cas9 expression is limited to the developing female germline, resulting double strand breaks are resolved by homology directed repair that copies the CopyCat allele from the donor to the receiver chromosome and leads to its super-Mendelian inheritance. These results demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9 gene drive mechanism can be implemented to simplify complex genetic crosses in laboratory mice and also contribute valuable data to the ongoing debate about applications to combat invasive rodent populations in island communities.",

    "abstract": "Division of Labor can occur as a consequence of a major evolutionary transition such as multicellularity but is also found in societies of similar individuals like microbes. It has been defined as a process that occurs when cooperating individuals specialize to carry out specific tasks in a distributed manner. This paper analyzes the conditions for division of labor to emerge as a beneficial evolutionary solution and proposes two novel mechanisms for this process to emerge as a consequence of cell communication in an isogenic group of cells. The study is conducted by means of the cell-based model gro that simulates the growth and interaction of cells in a two-dimensional bacterial colony. When the labor is social, like the production of a molecule that is publicly shared, simulation results indicate that division of labor provides higher fitness than individual labor if the benefits of specialization are accelerating. Two genetic networks that generate consensual and reversible specialization are presented and characterized. In the proposed mechanisms, cells self-organize through the exchange of certain molecules and coordinate behaviors at the local level without the requirements of any fitness benefits. In addition, the proposed regulatory mechanisms are able to create de novo patterns unprecedented to this date that can scale with size.",

Neurons utilize microtubule-dependent molecular motors to allocate proteasomes to synapses, but how proteasomes are coupled to motor proteins and how this transport is regulated to meet changing demand for protein breakdown remains largely unknown. We show that the conserved proteasome-binding protein PI31 serves as an adaptor to directly couple proteasomes with dynein light chain proteins (DYNLL1/2). Inactivation of PI31 inhibits proteasome motility in axons and disrupts synaptic protein homeostasis, structure and function. Moreover, phosphorylation of PI31 at a conserved site by p38 MAP kinase promotes binding to DYNLL1/2, and a non-phosphorable PI31 mutant impairs proteasome movement in axons, suggesting a mechanism to regulate loading of proteasomes onto motor proteins. Because mutations affecting PI31 activity are associated with human neurodegenerative diseases, impairment of PI31-mediated axonal transport of proteasomes may be the root cause of these disorders.",

While gef1 and scd1 mutants exhibit distinct phenotypes, how they do so is unclear given that they activate the same GTPase. Using the GEF localization pattern during cytokinesis as a paradigm, we report a novel interplay between Gef1 and Scd1 that spatially modulates Cdc42. We find that Gef1 promotes Scd1 localization to the division site during cytokinesis and to the new end during polarized growth through the recruitment of the scaffold Scd2 via a Cdc42 feedforward pathway. Gef1-mediated Scd1 recruitment at the new end enables the transition from monopolar to bipolar growth. Reciprocally, Scd1 restricts Gef1 localization to prevent ectopic Cdc42 activation during cytokinesis to promote cell separation and during interphase to maintain cell shape. Our findings reveal an elegant regulatory pattern in which Gef1 establishes new sites of Scd1-mediated Cdc42 activity, while Scd1 restricts Gef1 to functional sites. We propose that crosstalk between GEFs is a conserved mechanism that orchestrates Cdc42 activation during complex cellular processes.\\n\\nSummary StatementCdc42 GEFs Gef1 and Scd1 crosstalk to fine-tune Cdc42 activity.

We quantified the protein mobility and dwell times during normal replication and following both damage-independent and damage-dependent replication fork stress. With these results, we report the dynamic and cooperative process of DNA replication based on changes in the measured diffusion coefficients and dwell times. These experiments show that the replisomal proteins are all highly dynamic and that the exchange rate depends on whether DNA synthesis is active or arrested. Our results also suggest coupling between PolC and DnaX in the DNA replication process, and indicate that DnaX provides an important role in synthesis during repair. Furthermore, our results show that DnaE provides a limited contribution to chromosomal replication and repair.",

    "abstract": "Virtually all higher organisms form holobionts with associated microbiota. To understand the biology of holobionts we need to know how species assemble and interact. Controlled experiments are suited to study interactions between particular symbionts, but they can only inform about a tiny portion of the diversity within each species. Alternatively, interactions can be inferred from associations among symbionts in the field that are more or less frequent than expected under random assortment. However, random assortment may not be a valid null hypothesis for maternally transmitted symbionts in finite populations, where drift alone can result in associations. Here we report results from a European field survey of endosymbionts in the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), and we develop a model to study the effect of drift on symbiont associations under different population sizes, considering varying rates of horizontal and maternal transmission. The model showed that even though horizontal transmissions and maternal transmission failures tend to randomise symbiont associations, drift can induce significant departures from random assortment, at least in moderate-sized populations. Based on these results, we carefully interpret our field survey and we re-visit the association between Spiroplasma and Wolbachia in Drosophila neotestacea reported by Jaenike et al. (2010). For this and for several significant associations between symbionts in European pea aphids we conclude that under reasonable assumptions of effective population size, they are indeed likely to be maintained by biased co-transmission or selection. Our study shows that formulating appropriate null expectations can strengthen the biological inference from co-occurrence patterns in the field.",

Using 30 regime shifts described as networks, we show that 45% of the pair-wise combinations of regime shifts present at least one plausible structural interdependence. Driver sharing is more common in aquatic systems, while hidden feedbacks are more commonly found in terrestrial and Earth systems tipping points. The likelihood of cascading effects depends on cross-scale interactions, but differs for each cascading effect type. Regime shifts should not be studied in isolation: instead, methods and data collection should account for potential teleconnections.",

    "abstract": "The number of probiotic products in the marketplace is on the rise, gaining momentum along with the upsurge in research on the role of the human gut microbiome in health. Although such products are considered safe for consumption, these probiotic supplements and beverages are not subject to stringent federal regulation for quality. While only certain strains of probiotic microbes have been studied for efficacy in clinical trials, the ingredient labels of commercial probiotics do not always list the strain names. In this study, we investigated the diversity of the bacteria and yeast sold in these products. From a representative selection of commercially available probiotic supplements and beverages, we cultured microbes and identified them with standard methods (16S rRNA gene sequencing, mass spectrometric identification, and Biolog phenotypic profiling), then assessed whether there were strain-specific differences in nutrient metabolism and tolerance to compounds across the isolates from different products. Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii were cultured from 21 commercial probiotic products (fifteen probiotic supplements and six probiotic beverages). Phenotypic profiling revealed metabolic diversity in carbon source usage and tolerance to compounds, within species from different probiotics and from environmental isolates of strains belonging to the same species. Despite this strain level diversity, we observed that up to half of the probiotic supplements for sale in retail and drugstores only list the species, but not the specific strain, on the label. This study highlights that existing labeling conventions for probiotics are insufficient to convey the strain identity and diversity in these products, underscoring the need for clear strain identification and verification of strain-specific probiotic properties, particularly when moving toward therapeutic applications of beneficial microbes.",

    "abstract": "Environmental change can lead decision makers to shift rapidly among different behavioral regimes. These behavioral shifts can be accompanied by rapid changes in the firing pattern of neural networks. However, it is unknown what the populations of neurons that participate in such \\\"network reset\\\" phenomena are representing. Here we examined 1) whether and where rapid changes in multivariate activity patterns are observable with fMRI during periods of rapid behavioral change, and 2) what types of representations give rise to these phenomena. We did so by examining fluctuations in multi-voxel patterns of BOLD activity from human subjects making sequential inferences about the state of a partially observable and discontinuously changing variable. We found that, within the context of this sequential inference task, the multivariate patterns of activity in a number of cortical regions contain representations that change more rapidly during periods of uncertainty following a change in behavioral context. In motor cortex, this phenomenon was indicative of discontinuous change in behavioral outputs, whereas in visual regions the same basic phenomenon was evoked by tracking of salient environmental changes. In most other cortical regions, including dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, the phenomenon was most consistent with directly encoding the degree of uncertainty. However, in a few other regions, including orbitofrontal cortex, the phenomenon was best explained by representations of a shifting context that evolve more rapidly during periods of rapid learning. These representations may provide a dynamic substrate for learning that facilitates rapid disengagement from learned responses during periods of change.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the human LMNA gene, which encodes the nuclear envelope (NE) proteins lamins A and C, cause autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and other diseases collectively known as laminopathies. The molecular mechanisms responsible for these diseases remain incompletely understood, but the muscle-specific defects suggest that mutations may render nuclei more susceptible to mechanical stress. Using three mouse models of muscle laminopathies, we found that Lmna mutations caused extensive NE abnormalities, consisting of chromatin protrusions into the cytoplasm and transient rupture of the NE in skeletal muscle cells. NE damage was associated with DNA damage, activation of DNA damage response pathways, and reduced viability. Intriguingly, NE damage resulted from nuclear migration in maturing skeletal muscle cells, rather than actomyosin contractility. NE damage and DNA damage was reduced by either depletion of kinesin-1 or disruption of the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. LINC complex disruption rescued myofiber function and viability in Lmna mutant myofibers, indicating that the myofiber dysfunction is the result of mechanically induced NE damage. The extent of NE damage and DNA damage in Lmna mouse models correlated with the disease onset and severity in vivo. Moreover, inducing DNA damage in wild-type muscle cells was sufficient to phenocopy the reduced cell viability of lamin A/C-deficient muscle cells, suggesting a causative role of DNA damage in disease pathogenesis. Corroborating the mouse model data, muscle biopsies from patients with LMNA muscular dystrophy revealed significant DNA damage compared to age-matched controls, particularly in severe cases of the disease. Taken together, these findings point to a new and important role of DNA damage as a pathogenic contributor for LMNA skeletal muscle diseases.",

    "abstract": "In Pseudomonas putida KT2440, two pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent ethanol dehydrogenases (PQQ-EDHs) are responsible for the periplasmic oxidation of a broad variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Depending on the availability of rare earth elements (REEs) of the lanthanide series (Ln3+), we have recently described that the transcription of the genes encoding the Ca2+-utilizing enzyme PedE and the Ln3+-utilizing enzyme PedH are inversely regulated. With adaptive evolution experiments, site-specific mutations, transcriptional reporter fusions, and complementation approaches, we herein demonstrate that the PedS2/PedR2 (PP_2671/PP_2672) two-component system (TCS) plays a central role in the observed REE-mediated switch of PQQ-EDHs in P. putida. We provide evidence that in the absence of lanthanum (La3+), the sensor histidine kinase PedS2 phosphorylates its cognate LuxR-type response regulator PedR2, which in turn not only activates pedE gene transcription but is also involved in repression of pedH. Our data further suggests that the presence of La3+ lowers kinase activity of PedS2, either by the direct binding of the metal ions to the periplasmic region of PedS2 or by an uncharacterized indirect interaction, leading to reduced levels of phosphorylated PedR2. Consequently, the fading pedE expression and concomitant alleviation of pedH repression causes - in conjunction with the transcriptional activation of the pedH gene by a yet unknown regulatory module - the Ln3+-dependent transition from PedE to PedH catalysed oxidation of alcoholic VOCs.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe function of lanthanides for methano- and methylotrophic bacteria is gaining increasing attention, while knowledge about the role of rare earth elements (REEs) in non-methylotrophic bacteria is still limited. The present study investigates the recently described differential expression of the two PQQ-EDHs of P. putida in response to lanthanides. We demonstrate that a specific TCS is crucial for their inverse regulation and provide evidence for a dual regulatory function of the LuxR-type response regulator involved. Thus, our study represents the first detailed characterization of the molecular mechanism underlying the REE switch of PQQ-EDHs in a non-methylotrophic bacterium and stimulates subsequent investigations for the identification of additional genes or phenotypic traits that might be co-regulated during REE-dependent niche adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Oscillations are ubiquitous features of brain dynamics that undergo task-related changes in synchrony, power, and frequency. The impact of those changes on target networks is poorly understood. In this work, we used a biophysically detailed model of prefrontal cortex (PFC) to explore the effects of varying the spike rate, synchrony, and waveform of strong oscillatory inputs on the behavior of cortical networks driven by them. Interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with strong feedback inhibition are inhibition-based network oscillators that exhibit resonance (i.e., larger responses to preferred input frequencies). We quantified network responses in terms of mean firing rates and the population frequency of network oscillation; and characterized their behavior in terms of the natural response to asynchronous input and the resonant response to oscillatory inputs. We show that strong feedback inhibition causes the PFC to generate internal (natural) oscillations in the beta/gamma frequency range (>15 Hz) and to maximize principal cell spiking in response to external oscillations at slightly higher frequencies. Importantly, we found that the fastest oscillation frequency that can be relayed by the network maximizes local inhibition and is equal to a frequency even higher than that which maximizes the firing rate of excitatory cells; we call this phenomenon population frequency resonance. This form of resonance is shown to determine the optimal driving frequency for suppressing responses to asynchronous activity. Lastly, we demonstrate that the natural and resonant frequencies can be tuned by changes in neuronal excitability, the duration of feedback inhibition, and dynamic properties of the input. Our results predict that PFC networks are tuned for generating and selectively responding to beta- and gamma-rhythmic signals due to the natural and resonant properties of inhibition-based oscillators. They also suggest strategies for optimizing transcranial stimulation and using oscillatory networks in neuromorphic engineering.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe prefrontal cortex (PFC) flexibly encodes task-relevant representations and outputs biases to mediate higher cognitive functions. The relevant neural ensembles undergo task-related changes in oscillatory dynamics at beta- and gamma frequencies. Using a computational model of the PFC network, we show that strong feedback inhibition causes the PFC to generate internal oscillations and to prefer external oscillations at similar frequencies. The precise frequencies that are generated and preferred can be flexibly tuned by varying the synchrony and strength of input network activity, the level of background excitation, and neuromodulation of intrinsic ion currents. We also show that the peak output frequency in response to external oscillations, which depends on the synchrony and strength of the input as well as the strong inhibitory feedback, is faster than the internally generated frequency, and that this difference enables exclusive response to oscillatory inputs. These properties enable changes in oscillatory dynamics to govern the selective processing and gating of task-relevant signals in service of cognitive control.",

    "abstract": "The formation and recall of long-term memory (LTM) requires neuron activity-induced gene expression. Transcriptome analysis has been used to identify genes that have altered expression after memory acquisition, however, we still have an incomplete picture of the transcriptional changes that are required for LTM formation. The complex spatial and temporal dynamics of memory formation creates significant challenges in defining memory-relevant gene expression changes. The mushroom body (MB) is a signaling hub in the insect brain that integrates sensory information to form memories. Here, we performed transcriptome analysis in the Drosophila MB at two time points after the acquisition of LTM: 1 hour and 24 hours. The MB transcriptome was compared to biologically paired whole head (WH) transcriptomes. In both, we identified more transcriptional changes 1 hour after memory acquisition (WH = 322, MB = 302) than at 24 hours (WH = 23, MB = 20). WH samples showed downregulation of developmental genes and upregulation of sensory response genes. In contrast, MB samples showed vastly different gene expression changes affecting biological processes that are specifically related to LTM. MB-downregulated genes were highly enriched for metabolic function, consistent with the MB-specific energy influx that occurs during LTM formation. MB-upregulated genes were highly enriched for known learning and memory processes, including calcium-mediated neurotransmitter release and cAMP signalling. The neuron activity inducible genes hr38 and sr were also specifically induced in the MB. These results highlight the importance of sampling time and cell type in capturing biologically relevant transcriptional changes involved in learning and memory. Our data suggests that MB cells transiently upregulate known memory-related pathways after memory acquisition and provides a critical frame of reference for further investigation into the role of MB-specific gene regulation in memory.",

Using a subset of RNA-Seq data from our high-resolution atlas of gene expression in sheep (Ovis aries) we have provided the first comprehensive characterisation of transcription of the entire the gastrointestinal (GI) tract during the transition from pre-ruminant to ruminant. The dataset comprises 168 tissue samples from sheep at four different time points (birth, one week, 8 weeks and adult). Using network cluster analysis we illustrate how the complexity of the GI tract is reflected in tissue- and developmental stage-specific differences in gene expression. The most significant transcriptional differences between neonatal and adult sheep were observed in the rumen complex. Differences in transcription between neonatal and adult sheep were particularly evident in macrophage specific signatures indicating they might be driving the observed developmental stage-specific differences. Comparative analysis of gene expression in three GI tract tissues from age-matched sheep and goats revealed species-specific differences in genes involved in immunity and metabolism. This study improves our understanding of the transcriptomic mechanisms involved in the transition from pre-ruminant to ruminant. It highlights key genes involved in immunity, microbe recognition, metabolism and cellular differentiation in the GI tract. The results form a basis for future studies linking gene expression with microbial colonisation of the developing GI tract and will contribute towards identifying genes that underlie immunity in early development, which could be utilised to improve ruminant efficiency and productivity.\\n\\nReference Numbers for Data in the Public RepositoriesThe raw RNA-Sequencing data are deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under study accessions PRJEB19199 (sheep) and PRJEB23196 (goat).

    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is caused by mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 encoding polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), respectively. The molecular pathways linking polycystins to cyst development in ADPKD are still unclear. Intracystic fluid secretion via ion transporters and channels plays a crucial role in cyst expansion in ADPKD. Unexpectedly, we observed significant and selective up-regulation of NHA2, a member of the SLC9B family of Na+/H+ exchangers that correlated with cyst size and disease severity in ADPKD patients. Using three-dimensional cultures of MDCK cells to model cystogenesis in vitro, we show that ectopic expression of NHA2 is causal to increased cyst size. Induction of PC1 in MDCK cells inhibited NHA2 expression with concordant inhibition of Ca2+ influx through store-dependent and independent pathways, whereas reciprocal activation of Ca2+ influx by a dominant negative, membrane-anchored C-terminal tail fragment of PC1 elevated NHA2. We show that NHA2 is a target of Ca2+/NFAT signaling and is transcriptionally induced by methylxanthine drugs such as caffeine and theophylline, which are contraindicated in ADPKD patients. Finally, we observe robust induction of NHA2 by vasopressin, which is physiologically consistent with increased levels of circulating vasopressin and up-regulation of vasopressin V2 receptors in ADPKD. Our findings have mechanistic implications on the emerging use of vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists such as tolvaptan as safe and effective therapy for PKD and reveal a potential new regulator of transepithelial salt and water transport in the kidney.",

    "abstract": "Mitotic chromosome alignment is essential for the robust separation of genetic material into daughter cells. In mammalian cells, this process requires the function of Kif18A, a kinesin-8 motor protein. Kif18A confines chromosome movement to the mitotic spindle equator by accumulating at the plus-ends of kinetochore microtubule bundles (K-fibers), where it functions to suppress K-fiber dynamics. It is not understood how the motor accumulates at K-fiber plus-ends, a difficult feat requiring the motor to navigate protein dense microtubule tracks. Our data indicate that Kif18As relatively long (17 amino acid) neck linker is required for the motors accumulation at K-fiber plus-ends. Shorter neck linker (sNL) variants of Kif18A display a deficiency in K-fiber accumulation, especially on K-fibers near the center of the spindle. This pattern correlates with the more uniform concentration of the microtubule bundling protein HURP on central K-fibers compared to peripheral K-fibers. Depletion of HURP permits Kif18A sNL to accumulate on central K-fibers, while HURP overexpression reduces wild-type Kif18As ability to accumulate on this same K-fiber subset. Furthermore, single molecule assays indicate that Kif18A sNL motors are less proficient at navigating microtubules coated with the microtubule associated protein tau. Taken together, these results support a model in which Kif18As neck linker length permits efficient navigation of obstacles such as HURP to reach K-fiber ends during mitosis.\\n\\nSignficiance StatementKinesin motor proteins play key roles in controlling chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division. The kinesin Kif18A confines chromosomes to the middle of the spindle by accumulating at the ends of microtubules attached to chromosomes. We show here that Kif18As ability to accumulate at the end of these microtubules requires navigation of microtubule-associated protein obstacles, and that this activity is imparted by a relatively long neck linker region. These findings demonstrate a molecular mechanism for navigation of densely populated microtubules inside a cell.",

    "abstract": "Insulin, a highly conserved peptide hormone, links nutrient availability to metabolism and growth in animals. Besides this, in fed states insulin levels are high and insulin acts as a satiety hormone. In animals that are food deprived insulin levels remain low which facilitates hunger induced feeding. Contrary to expectations, we present evidence for persistent Drosophila insulin-like peptide gene expression and insulin signalling during initial phases of starvation. Maintenance of insulin signalling is crucial to sustain feeding responses during initial stages of starvation. Insulin signalling acts in a feedback loop involving the abdominal fatbody to maintain dilp gene expression in the early stages of food deprivation. Furthermore, another feedback regulatory loop between insulin-producing cells (IPCs) and neurons that produce the orectic hormone short-neuropeptide-F (sNPF), maintains sNPF levels and triggers feeding behavior. Thus, insulin acts through multiple feedback regulatory loops to elicit orexigenic responses and aid in efficient utilization of energy stores during early starvation.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic resetting in germ cells during development leads to the de-repression of transposable elements (TEs). piRNAs protect fetal germ cells from potentially harmful TEs by targeted destruction of mRNA and deposition of repressive epigenetic marks. Here we provide the first evidence for an active piRNA pathway and TE repression in germ cells of human fetal testis. We identify pre-pachytene piRNAs with features of secondary amplification that map most abundantly to L1 family TEs. We find that L1-ORF1p expression is heterogeneous in fetal germ cells, peaks at mid-gestation and declines concomitantly with increasing levels of piRNAs and H3K9me3, as well as nuclear localization of HIWI2. Surprisingly, following this decline, the same cells with accumulation of L1-ORF1p display highest levels of HIWI2 and H3K9me3, whereas L1-ORF1p low cells are also low in HIWI2 and H3K9me3. Conversely, earlier in development, the germ cells lacking L1-ORF1p express high levels of the chaperone HSP90a. We propose that a subset of HSP90a-armed germ cells resists L1 expression, whereas only those vulnerable L1-expressing germ cells activate the PIWI-piRNA repression pathway which leads to epigenetic silencing of L1 via H3K9me3.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing has spurred the development of computational methods that enable researchers to classify cell types, delineate developmental trajectories, and measure molecular responses to external perturbations. Many of these technologies rely on their ability to detect genes whose cell-to-cell variations arise from the biological processes of interest rather than transcriptional or technical noise. However, for datasets in which the biologically relevant differences between cells are subtle, identifying these genes is a challenging task. We present the self-assembling manifold (SAM) algorithm, an iterative soft feature selection strategy to quantify gene relevance and improve dimensionality reduction. We demonstrate its advantages over other state-of-the-art methods with experimental validation in identifying novel stem cell populations of Schistosoma, a prevalent parasite that infects hundreds of millions of people. Extending our analysis to a total of 56 datasets, we show that SAM is generalizable and consistently outperforms other methods in a variety of biological and quantitative benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Can a single regulatory sequence be shared by two genes undergoing functional divergence? Here we describe a single promiscuous enhancer within the Drosophila Antennapedia Complex, EO053, that directs aspects of the expression of two adjacent genes, pb (a Hox2 ortholog) and zen2 (a divergent Hox3 paralog), with disparate spatial and temporal expression patterns. We were unable to separate the pb-like and zen2-like specificities within EO053, and we identify sequences affecting both expression patterns. Importantly, deletion of EO053 affects expression of both genes as well, despite each gene having additional enhancers. We examine sequence conservation of EO053 within the Schizophora, and show that patterns of synteny between the Hox2 and Hox3 orthologs in Arthropods are consistent with a shared regulatory relationship extending prior to the Hox3/zen divergence. Thus, EO053 represents an example of two genes having evolved disparate outputs while utilizing this shared regulatory region.",

    "abstract": "Lupus nephritis is a potentially fatal autoimmune disease, whose current treatment is ineffective and often toxic. To gain insights into disease mechanisms, we analyzed kidney samples from lupus nephritis patients and healthy controls using single-cell RNA-seq. Our analysis revealed 21 subsets of leukocytes active in disease, including multiple populations of myeloid, T, NK and B cells, demonstrating both pro-inflammatory and resolving responses. We found evidence of local activation of B cells correlated with an age-associated B cell signature, and of progressive stages of monocyte differentiation within the kidney. A clear interferon response was observed in most cells. Two chemokine receptors, CXCR4 and CX3CR1, were broadly expressed, pointing to potential therapeutic targets. Gene expression of immune cells in urine and kidney was highly correlated, suggesting urine may be a surrogate for kidney biopsies. Our results provide a first comprehensive view of the complex network of leukocytes active in lupus nephritis kidneys.",
