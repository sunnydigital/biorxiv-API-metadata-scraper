    "abstract": "Although diversity-dependent plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) may contribute significantly to plant diversity effects on ecosystem functioning, the influence of underlying abiotic and biotic mechanistic pathways have been little explored to date. Here, we assessed such pathways with a PSF experiment using soil conditioned for [&ge;]12 years from two grassland biodiversity experiments. Model plant communities differing in diversity were grown in soils conditioned by plant communities with either low- or high-diversity (soil history). Our results reveal that plant diversity can modify plant productivity through both diversity-mediated plant-plant and plant-soil interactions, with the main driver (current plant diversity or soil history) differing with experimental context. The underlying mechanisms of PSFs were explained to a significant extent by both abiotic and biotic pathways (specifically, nematode richness and soil nitrogen availability). Thus, effects of plant diversity loss on ecosystem functioning may persist or even increase over time because of biotic and abiotic soil legacy effects.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified thousands of variants associated with complex traits, but their biological interpretation often remains unclear. Most of these variants overlap with expression QTLs (eQTLs), indicating their potential involvement in the regulation of gene expression.\\n\\nHere, we propose an advanced transcriptome-wide summary statistics-based Mendelian Randomization approach (called TWMR) that uses multiple SNPs jointly as instruments and multiple gene expression traits as exposures, simultaneously.\\n\\nWhen applied to 43 human phenotypes it uncovered 2,369 genes whose blood expression is putatively associated with at least one phenotype resulting in 3,913 gene-trait associations; of note, 36% of them had no genome-wide significant SNP nearby in previous GWAS analysis. Using independent association summary statistics (UKBiobank), we confirmed that the majority of these loci were missed by conventional GWAS due to power issues. Noteworthy among these novel links is educational attainment-associated BSCL2, known to carry mutations leading to a mendelian form of encephalopathy. We similarly unraveled novel pleiotropic causal effects suggestive of mechanistic connections, e.g. the shared genetic effects of GSDMB in rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease.\\n\\nOur advanced Mendelian Randomization unlocks hidden value from published GWAS through higher power in detecting associations.

    "abstract": "We present an algorithm for inferring ancestry segments and characterizing admixture events, which involve an arbitrary number of genetically differentiated groups coming together. This allows inference of the demographic history of the species, properties of admixing groups, identification of signatures of natural selection, and may aid disease gene mapping. The algorithm employs nested hidden Markov models to obtain local ancestry estimation along the genome for each admixed individual. In a range of simulations, the accuracy of these estimates equals or exceeds leading existing methods that return local ancestry. Moreover, and unlike these approaches, we do not require any prior knowledge of the relationship between sub-groups of donor reference haplotypes and the unseen mixing ancestral populations. Instead, our approach infers these in terms of conditional \\\"copying probabilities\\\". In application to the Human Genome Diversity Panel we corroborate many previously inferred admixture events (e.g. an ancient admixture event in the Kalash). We further identify novel events such as complex 4-way admixture in San-Khomani individuals, and show that Eastern European populations possess 1 - 5% ancestry from a group resembling modern-day central Asians. We also identify evidence of recent natural selection favouring sub-Saharan ancestry at the HLA region, across North African individuals. We make available an R and C++ software library, which we term MOSAIC (which stands for MOSAIC Organises Segments of Ancestry In Chromosomes).",

In this study, we used insertion sequencing (INSeq) to reveal the genetic determinants responsible for the fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PGPR2 during root colonization. We generated a random transposon mutant library of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PGPR2 comprising 39,500 unique insertions and identified genes required for growth in culture and on corn roots. A total of 108 genes were identified as contributing to the fitness of strain PGPR2 on roots. The importance in root colonization of four genes identified in the TnSeq screen was verified by constructing deletion mutants in the genes and testing them for the ability to colonize corn roots singly or in competition with the wild type. All four mutants were affected in corn root colonization, displaying 5-to 100-fold reductions in populations in single inoculations, and all were outcompeted by the wild type by almost 100-fold after seven days on corn roots in mixed inoculations of the wild type and mutant. The genes identified in the screen had homology to genes involved in amino acid catabolism, stress adaptation, detoxification, signal transduction, and transport. INSeq technology proved a successful tool to identify fitness factors in P. aeruginosa PGPR2 for root colonization.",

    "abstract": "Narcolepsy type 1 is a neurological sleep disorder mainly characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, fragmented night sleep, and cataplexy (muscle atonia triggered by emotions). To characterize brain activation patterns in response to neutral-rated and fun-rated movies in narcolepsy type 1 we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging during a paradigm consisting of 30 short movies (25/30 with a humorous punchline; 5/30 without a humorous punchline (but with similar build-up/anticipation)) that the participants rated based on their humor experience. We included 41 narcolepsy type 1 patients (31 females, mean age 23.6 years, 38/41 H1N1-vaccinated, 41/41 HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive, 40/40 hypocretin-deficient) and 44 first-degree relatives (24 females, mean age 19.6 years, 30/44 H1N1-vaccinated, 27/44 HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive) as controls. Group-level inferences were made using permutation testing.\\n\\nPermutation testing revealed no significant differences in the average ratings of patients and controls. Functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis revealed that both groups showed higher activations in response to fun-rated movies in several brain regions associated with humor processing, with no significant group differences. In contrast, patients showed significantly higher activation compared to controls during neutral-rated movies; including bilaterally in the thalamus, pallidum, putamen, amygdala, hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus, cerebellum, brainstem and in the left precuneus, supramarginal gyrus and caudate.\\n\\nThe presence of a humorous punchline in a neutral-rated movie is important since we found no brain overactivation for narcolepsy type 1 patients for movies without a humorous punchline (89.0% neutral-rated) compared with controls.\\n\\nFurther, a comparison between fun-rated and neutral-rated movies revealed a pattern of higher activation during fun-rated movies in controls, patients showed no significant differentiation between these states. Group analyses revealed significantly stronger differentiation between fun-rated and neutral-rated movies in controls compared with patients, including bilaterally in the inferior frontal gyrus, thalamus, putamen, precentral gyrus, lingual gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, occipital areas, temporal areas, cerebellum and in the right hippocampus, postcentral gyrus, pallidum and insula.\\n\\nIn conclusion, during neutral-rated movies, narcolepsy type 1 patients showed significantly higher activation in several cortical and subcortical regions previously implicated in humor and REM sleep, including the thalamus and basal ganglia. The relative lack of differentiation between neutral-rated and fun-rated movies in narcolepsy type 1 patients might represent insight into the mechanisms associated with cataplexy, in which a long-lasting hypervigilant state could represent risk (hypersensitivity to potential humorous stimuli) for the narcolepsy type 1 patients, which seem to have a lower threshold for activating the humor response, even during neutral-rated movies.",

N. benthamiana has a complex ancient allopolyploid genome with 19 chromosomes, and an estimated genome size of 3.1Gb. Several draft assemblies of the N. benthamiana genome have been generated, however, many of the gene-models in these draft assemblies appear incorrect. Here we present a nearly non-redundant database of 42,855 improved N. benthamiana gene-models. With an estimated 97.6% completeness, the new predicted proteome is more complete than the previous proteomes. We show that the database is more sensitive and accurate in proteomics applications, while maintaining a reasonable low gene number. As a proof-of-concept we use this proteome to compare the leaf extracellular (apoplastic) proteome to a total extract of leaves. Several gene families are more abundant in the apoplast. For one of these apoplastic protein families, the subtilases, we present a phylogenetic analysis illustrating the utility of this database. Besides proteome annotation, this database will aid the research community with improved target gene selection for genome editing and off-target prediction for gene silencing.",

Specifically, we review a number of implementations using Hadoop of high-throughput analyses, e.g. ligand-protein docking and structural alignment, and their scalability in comparison with other batch schedulers and MPI. We find that these deployments for the most part use known executables called from MapReduce rather than rewriting the algorithms. The scalability exhibits a variable behaviour in comparison with other batch schedulers, particularly as direct comparisons on the same platform are generally not available. We do note there is some evidence that MPI implementations scale better than Hadoop. A significant barrier to the use of the Hadoop ecosystem is the difficulty of the interface and configuration of a resource to use Hadoop. This will improve over time as interfaces to Hadoop e.g. Spark improve, usage of cloud platforms (e.g. Azure and AWS) increases and approaches such as the Workflow Definition Language are taken up.",

    "abstract": "Recent technological advances in single cell sequencing (SCS) provide high resolution data for studying intra-tumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution. Available computational methods for tumor phylogeny inference via SCS typically aim to identify the most likely perfect phylogeny tree satisfying infinite sites assumption (ISA). However limitations of SCS technologies such as frequent allele dropout or highly variable sequence coverage, commonly result in mutational call errors and prohibit a perfect phylogeny. In addition, ISA violations are commonly observed in tumor phylogenies due to the loss of heterozygosity, deletions and convergent evolution. In order to address such limitations, we, for the first time, introduce a new combinatorial formulation that integrates single cell sequencing data with matching bulk sequencing data, with the objective of minimizing a linear combination of (i) potential false negatives (due to e.g. allele dropout or variance in sequence coverage) and (ii) potential false positives (due to e.g. read errors) among mutation calls, as well as (iii) the number of mutations that violate ISA - to define the optimal sub-perfect phylogeny. Our formulation ensures that several lineage constraints imposed by the use of variant allele frequencies (VAFs, derived from bulk sequence data) are satisfied. We express our formulation both in the form of an integer linear program (ILP) and - for the first time in the context of tumor phylogeny reconstruction - a boolean constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and solve them by leveraging state-of-the-art ILP/CSP solvers. The resulting method, which we name PhISCS, is the first to integrate SCS and bulk sequencing data under the finite sites model. Using several simulated and real SCS data sets, we demonstrate that PhISCS is not only more general but also more accurate than the alternative tumor phylogeny inference tools. PhISCS is very fast especially when its CSP based variant is used returns the optimal solution, except in rare instances for which it provides an optimality gap. PhISCS is available at https://github.com/haghshenas/PhISCS.",

    "abstract": "The factors contributing to the maintenance of sex over asexuality in natural populations remain largely unknown. Ecological divergences between lineages with different reproductive modes could help to maintain reproductive polymorphisms, at least transiently, but there is little empirical information on the consequences of asexuality for the evolution of ecological niches. Here, we investigated how niche breadths evolve following transitions from sexual reproduction to asexuality. We estimated and compared the realized feeding niche breadths of five independently derived asexual Timema stick insect species and their sexual relatives. We found that asexual species had a systematically narrower realized niche than sexual species. To investigate how the narrower realized niches of asexual versus sexual species come about, we quantified the breadth of their fundamental niches but found no systematic differences between reproductive modes. The narrow realized niches found in asexuals are therefore likely a consequence of biotic interactions that constrain realized niche size in asexuals more strongly than in sexuals. Interestingly, the fundamental niche was broader in the oldest asexual species compared to its sexual relative. This broad ecological tolerance may help explain how this species has persisted over more than a million years in absence of sex.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe US has experienced a nationwide resurgence of pertussis since the mid-1970s, despite high vaccine coverage. Short-lived immunity induced by Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis (DTaP) vaccines in young children is widely believed to be responsible for this growing burden. However, the duration of protection conferred by DTaP vaccines remains incompletely quantified.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe employed a rigorously validated, age-structured model of pertussis transmission to explore a range of hypotheses regarding the degree of waning DTaP-derived immunity. For every hypothesis, we calculated the vaccine effectiveness and the relative increase in the odds of acquiring pertussis (or odds ratio) in children aged 5 to 9 years. We then assessed the simulated DTaP vaccine traits that best reproduced the empirical values of odds ratios from recent US epidemiological studies. We found a marked association between the degree of waning immunity, the vaccine effectiveness, and the odds ratio. Unexpectedly, the odds ratio was positively associated with the vaccine effectiveness, as a consequence of non-linear, age-assortative dynamics. Based on the empirical odds ratios, we estimated that vaccine effectiveness exceeded 75% and that more than 65% of children remained immune to pertussis 5 years after the last DTaP dose.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results show that temporal trends in the odds of acquiring pertussis are a seriously flawed measure of the durability of vaccine-induced protection. They further demonstrate that DTaP vaccines confer imperfect, but long-lived protection. We argue that control strategies should be based upon the best available estimates of vaccine properties and the age-structure of the transmission network.",

    "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is a pathogen spread by Aedes mosquitoes that has a considerable impact on global health. Agent-based models can be used to explicitly represent factors that are difficult to measure empirically, by focusing on specific aspects of DENV transmission dynamics that influence spread in a particular location. We present a new agent-based model for DENV dynamics, DTK-Dengue, that can be readily applied to new locations and to a diverse set of goals. It extends the vector-borne disease module in the Institute for Disease Modellings Epidemiological Modeling Disease Transmission Kernel (EMOD-DTK) to model DENV dynamics. There are three key modifications present in DTK-Dengue: 1) modifications to how climatic variables influence vector development for Aedes mosquitoes, 2) updates to adult vector behavior to make them more similar to Aedes, and 3) the inclusion of four DENV serotypes, including their effects on human immunity and symptoms. We demonstrate DTK-Dengues capabilities by fitting the model to four interrelated datasets: total and serotype-specific dengue incidences between January 2007 and December 2008 from San Juan, Puerto Rico; the age distribution of reported dengue cases in Puerto Rico during 2007; and the number of adult female Ae. aegypti trapped in two neighborhoods of San Juan between November 2007 and December 2008. The model replicated broad patterns in the reference data, including a correlation between vector population dynamics and rainfall, appropriate seasonality in the reported incidence, greater circulation of DENV-3 than any other serotype, and an inverse relationship between age and the proportion of cases associated with each age group over 20 years old. This exercise demonstrates the potential for DTK-Dengue to assimilate multiple types of epidemiologic data into a realistic portrayal of DENV transmission dynamics. Due to the open availability of the DTK-Dengue software and the availability of numerous other modules for modeling disease transmission and control from EMOD-DTK, this new model has potential for a diverse range of future applications in a wide variety of settings.",

    "abstract": "Cold tolerance plays a critical role in determining species geographical range limits. Previous studies have found that range shifts in response to climate warming are facilitated by cold acclimation capacities, due to increasingly colder and variable weather at high latitudes, and that cold tolerance can also be influenced by social factors. In this study we combined experiments and field studies to investigate the climatic and social factors affecting cold tolerances in range-shifting populations of the female-polymorphic damselfly Ischnura elegans in northeast Scotland. In the field, we observed both environmental (measured via habitat suitability) and social (sex ratio and density) effects on cold tolerance (CTmin). Androchrome females (male-like females) were less susceptible to beneficial social effects on cold tolerance than gynochromes (female-like females), and correspondingly, gynochrome frequency increased at colder, environmentally-limiting sites towards the range margin. Our manipulations of density in the laboratory further provide novel, experimental evidence that social interactions directly impact cold tolerance n this species. These results suggest that reciprocal effects of social environments on thermal acclimation may be an important but commonly overlooked aspect of allee effects which contribute to the formation of range margins. Moreover, our results point to a wider need to consider the role of population and social dynamics to shape both the thermal physiology of individuals and the thermal niches of species.",

    "abstract": "Psilocybin is a psychoactive compound with clinical applications produced by dozens of mushroom species1. There has been a longstanding interest in psilocybin research with regard to treatment for addiction2, depression3, and end-of-life suffering4. However, until recently very little was known about psilocybin biosynthesis and its ecological role. Here we confirm and refine recent findings5 about the genes underpinning psilocybin biosynthesis, discover that there is more than one psilocybin biosynthesis cluster in mushrooms, and we provide the first data directly addressing psilocybins ecological role. By analysing independent genome assemblies for the hallucinogenic mushrooms Psilocybe cyanescens and Pluteus salicinus we recapture the recently discovered psilocybin biosynthesis cluster5,6 and show that a transcription factor previously implicated in its regulation is actually not part of the cluster. Further, we show that the mushroom Inocybe corydalina produces psilocybin but does not contain the established biosynthetic cluster, and we present an alternative cluster. Finally, a meta-transcriptome analysis of wild-collected mushrooms provides evidence for intra-mushroom insect gene expression of flies whose larvae grow inside Psilocybe cyanescens. These larvae were successfully reared into adults. Our results show that psilocybin does not confer complete protection against insect mycophagy, and the hypothesis that it is produced as an adaptive defense compound may need to be reconsidered.",

    "abstract": "An essential feature of the adaptive immune system is the proliferation of antigen-specific lymphocytes during an immune reaction to form a large pool of effector cells. This proliferation must be regulated to ensure an effective response to infection while avoiding immunopathology. Recent experiments in mice have demonstrated that the expansion of a specific clone of T cells in response to cognate antigen obeys a striking inverse power law with respect to the initial number of T cells. Here, we show that such a relationship arises naturally from a model in which T cell expansion is limited by decaying levels of presented antigen. The same model also accounts for the observed dependence of T cell expansion on affinity for antigen and on the kinetics of antigen administration. Extending the model to address expansion of multiple T cell clones competing for antigen, we find that higher affinity clones can suppress the proliferation of lower affinity clones, thereby promoting the specificity of the response. Employing the model to derive optimal vaccination protocols, we find that exponentially increasing antigen doses can achieve a nearly optimized response. We thus conclude that the dynamics of presented antigen is a key regulator of both the size and specificity of the adaptive immune response.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the complexity of human brain dynamics and brain connectivity across the repertoire of functional neuroimaging and various conditions, is of paramount importance. Novel measures should be designed tailored to the input focusing on multichannel activity and dynamic functional brain connectivity (DFBC).\\n\\nHere, we defined a novel complexity index (CI) from the field of symbolic dynamics that quantifies patterns of different words up to a length from a symbolic sequence. The CI characterizes the complexity of the brain activity.\\n\\nWe analysed dynamic functional brain connectivity by adopting the sliding window approach using imaginary part of phase locking value (iPLV) for EEG/ECoG/MEG and wavelet coherence (WC) for fMRI. Both intra and cross-frequency couplings (CFC) namely phase-to-amplitude were estimated using iPLV/WC at every snapshot of the DFBC. Using proper surrogate analysis, we defined the dominant intrinsic coupling mode (DICM) per pair of regions-of-interest (ROI). The spatio-temporal probability distribution of DICM were reported to reveal the most prominent coupling modes per condition and modality. Finally, a novel flexibility index is defined that quantifies the transition of DICM per pair of ROIs between consecutive time-windows.\\n\\nThe whole methodology was demonstrated using four neuroimaging datasets (EEG/ECoG/MEG/fMRI).\\n\\nFinally, we succeeded to totally discriminate healthy controls from schizophrenic using FI and dynamic reconfiguration of DICM. Anesthesia independently of the drug caused a global decreased of complexity in all frequency bands with the exception in {delta} and alters the dynamic reconfiguration of DICM. CI and DICM of MEG/fMRI resting-state recordings in two spatial scales were high reliable.\\n\\nSignificant StatementIn the present study, we demonstrated novel indexes for the estimation of complexity in both raw brain activity and dynamic functional connectivity. To ort the universality of both indexes for the majority of functional neuroimaging modalities, we adopted open datasets from electro and magneto-encephalography, from electro-corticography and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Both indexes proved informative and reliable across repeat scan sessions. Moreover, we succeeded to totally discriminate with absolute accuracy healthy controls from schizophrenic patients. Both indexes proved sensitive to common anesthetic drugs effect in monkeys and reliable in MEG and fMRI repeat scan sessions. We first reported the notion of cross-frequency coupling in BOLD activity. Our analysis could be adapted it in any task and modality for any hypothesis driven study.",

    "abstract": "Mapping the brain structures in three-dimensional accurately is critical for an in-depth understanding of the brain functions. By using the brain atlas as a hub, mapping detected datasets into a standard brain space enables efficiently use of various datasets. However, because of the heterogeneous and non-uniform characteristics of the brain structures at cellular level brought with the recently developed high-resolution whole-brain microscopes, traditional registration methods are difficult to apply to the robust mapping of various large volume datasets. Here, we proposed a robust Brain Spatial Mapping Interface (BrainsMapi) to address the registration of large volume datasets at cellular level by introducing the extract regional features of the anatomically invariant method and a strategy of parameter acquisition and large volume transformation. By performing validation on model data and biological images, BrainsMapi can not only achieve robust registration on sample tearing and streak image datasets, different individual and modality datasets accurately, but also are able to complete the registration of large volume dataset at cellular level which dataset size reaches 20 TB. Besides, it can also complete the registration of historical vectorized dataset. BrainsMapi would facilitate the comparison, reuse and integration of a variety of brain datasets.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization has been shown to affect a variety of traits in animals, including their physiology, morphology, and behaviour, but it is less clear how cognitive traits are modified. Urban habitats contain artificially elevated food sources, such as bird feeders, that are known to affect the foraging behaviours of urban animals. As of yet however, it is not known whether urbanization and the abundance of supplemental food during the winter reduce caching behaviours and spatial memory in scatter hoarders. We aimed to examine individual variation in caching and spatial memory between and within urban and rural habitats to determine i) whether urban individuals cache less frequently and perform less accurately on a spatial task, and ii) explore, for the first time in scatter hoarders, whether slower explorers perform more accurately on a spatial task, indicating a speed-accuracy trade-off within individuals. We assessed spatial memory of wild-caught black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus; N = 96) from 14 sites along an urban gradient. While the individuals that cached more food in captivity were all from rural environments, we find no clear evidence that caching intensity and spatial memory accuracy differ along an urban gradient, and find no significant relationship between spatial cognition and exploration of a novel environment within individuals. However, individuals that performed more accurately also tended to cache more frequently, suggesting for the first time that the specialization of spatial memory in scatter hoarders may also occur at the level of the individual in addition to the population and species levels.",

Existing computational methods typically fail to detect weak or dynamic interactions because they use a peak-calling step that ignores paired-end linkage information. We have developed a novel computational method called Chromatin Interaction Discovery (CID) to overcome this limitation with an unbiased clustering approach for interaction discovery. CID outperforms existing chromatin interaction detection methods with improved sensitivity, replicate consistency, and concordance with other chromatin interaction datasets. In addition, CID also outperforms other methods in discovering chromatin interactions from HiChIP data. We expect that the CID method will be valuable in characterizing 3D chromatin interactions and in understanding the functional consequences of disease-associated distal genetic variations.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionSEARCH is one of four randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the strategy of community-based treatment-as-prevention (TasP) for the reduction of HIV incidence in sub-Saharan Africa. SEARCH takes place among 32 pair-matched rural communities in three regions of East Africa and exceeded the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets for HIV testing, linkage to care, and viral suppression in the intervention arm. We used mathematical modeling to estimate expected 3-year cumulative HIV incidence in both arms of the trial, using different assumptions about two main sources of uncertainty: scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the control arm, and the degree of mixing between SEARCH residents and non-residents.\\n\\nMethodsWe used the HIV modelling software EMOD-HIV to configure and calibrate a new model of the SEARCH communities. The 32 trial communities were clustered into six nodes (three for the control arm and three for the intervention arm) using k-means clustering based on community HIV prevalence, male circumcision rates, mobility, and geographic region. The model was parameterized using data on demographics, HIV prevalence, male circumcision rates, and viral suppression data collected at trial baseline in 2013, and calibrated to nodespecific and age-specific HIV prevalence, ART coverage, and population size. Using data on ART scale-up in subsequent follow-up years in the trial, we varied linkage to ART in the control arm and the degree of external mixing between SEARCH residents and non-residents.\\n\\nResultsIf no external mixing and no additional control arm ART linkage occurred, we estimate the trial would report a relative risk (RR) of 0.60 (95% CI 0.54-0.67, p<0.001), with all simulations showing a significant result. However, if SEARCH residents mixed equivalently with non-residents and ART linkage in the control arm also increased such that the control arm also exceeded the 73% viral suppression target, the RR is estimated to be 0.96 (95% CI 0.87-1.06, p=0.458) and 72% of simulations are non-significant. Given our \\\"best guess\\\" assumptions about external mixing and year 3 data on ART linkage in the control arm, the RR is estimated to be 0.90 (95% CI 0.81-1.00, p=0.05), with 49% non-significant simulations.\\n\\nConclusionThe SEARCH trial is predicted to show a 4-40% reduction in cumulative 3-year incidence, but between 18-72% of simulations were non-significant if either or both ART linkage in the control arm and external mixing are substantial. Despite achieving the 90-90-90 targets, our \\\"best guess\\\" is that the SEARCH trial has an equal probability of reporting a non-significant reduction in HIV incidence as it does a significant reduction.",

    "abstract": "When using repeated measures linear regression models to make causal inference in laboratory, clinical and environmental research, it is often assumed that the Within Subject association of differences (or changes) in predictor value across replicates is the same as the Between Subject association of differences in those predictor values. But this is often false, for example with body weight as the predictor and blood cholesterol the outcome i) a 10 pound weight increase in the same adult more greatly a higher increase in cholesterol in that adult than does ii) one adult weighing 10 pounds more than a second reflect increased cholesterol levels in the first adult as the weigh difference in i) more closely tracks higher body fat while that in ii) is also influenced by heavier adults being taller. Hence to make causal inferences, different Within and Between subject slopes should be separately modeled. A related misconception commonly made using generalized estimation equations (GEE) and mixed models (MM) on repeated measures (i.e. for fitting Cross Sectional Regression) is that the working correlation structure used only influences variance of model parameter estimates. But only independence working correlation guarantees the modeled parameters have any interpretability. We illustrate this with an example where changing working correlation from independence to equicorrelation qualitatively biases parameters of GEE models and show this happens because Between and Within Subject slopes for the predictor variables differ. We then describe several common mechanisms that cause Within and Between Subject slopes to differ as; change effects, lag/reverse lag and spillover causality, shared within subject measurement bias or confounding, and predictor variable measurement error. The misconceptions noted here should be better publicized in laboratory, clinical and environmental research. Repeated measures analyses should compare Within and Between subject slopes of predictors and when they differ, investigate the reasons this has happened.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSWhen using repeated measures with time varying predictors variables in laboratory, clinical and environmental research: O_LICross sectional regressions with any working correlation structure other than independence often give non-meaningful results\\nC_LIO_LIBetween/Within subject decomposition of slopes should be undertaken when making causal inferences\\nC_LIO_LIInvestigators should investigate the reasons Between and Within Subject slopes differ if this occurs\\nC_LI",
