    "abstract": "As recombination plays an important role in evolution, its estimation, as well as, the identification of hotspot positions is of considerable interest. We propose a novel approach for estimating historical recombination along a chromosome that involves a sequential multiscale change point estimator. Our method also permits to take demography into account. It uses a composite likelihood estimate and other summary statistics within a regression model fitted on suitable scenarios. Our proposed method is accurate, computationally fast, and provides a parsimonious solution by ensuring a type I error control against too many changes in the recombination rate. An application to human genome data suggests a good congruence between our estimated and experimentally identified hotspots. Our method is implemented in the R-package LDJump, which is freely available from https://github.com/PhHermann/LDJump.",

    "abstract": "Here we present an open-source R package  meaRtools that provides a platform for analyzing neuronal networks recorded on Microelectrode Arrays (MEAs). Cultured neuronal networks monitored with MEAs are now being widely used to characterize in vitro models of neurological disorders and to evaluate pharmaceutical compounds. meaRtools provides core algorithms for MEA spike train analysis, feature extraction, statistical analysis and plotting of multiple MEA recordings with multiple genotypes and treatments. meaRtools functionality covers novel solutions for spike train analysis, including algorithms to assess electrode cross-correlation using the spike train tiling coefficient (STTC), mutual information, synchronized bursts and entropy within cultured wells. Also integrated is a solution to account for bursts variability originating from mixed-cell neuronal cultures. The package provides a statistical platform built specifically for MEA data that can combine multiple MEA recordings and compare extracted features between different genetic models or treatments. We demonstrate the utilization of meaRtools to successfully identify epilepsy-like phenotypes in neuronal networks from Celf4 knockout mice. The package is freely available under the GPL license (GPL>=3) and is updated frequently on the CRAN web-server repository. The package, along with full documentation can be downloaded from: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meaRtools/.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCultured neuronal networks are widely used to study and characterize neuronal network activity. Among the many uses of neuronal cultures are the capabilities to evaluate neurotoxicity and the effects of pharmacological compounds on cellular physiology. Multi-well microelectrode arrays (MEAs) can collect high-throughput data from multiple neuronal cultures simultaneously, and thereby make possible hypotheses-driven inquiries into neurobiology and neuropharmacology. The analysis of MEA-derived information presents many computational challenges. High frequency data recorded simultaneously from hundreds of electrodes can be difficult to handle. The need to compare network activity across various drug treatments or genotypes recorded on the same plate from experiments lasting several weeks presents another challenge. These challenges inspired us to develop meaRtools; an MEA data analysis package that contains new methods to characterize network activity patterns, which are illustrated here using examples from a genetic mouse model of epilepsy. Among the highlights of meaRtools are novel algorithms designed to characterize neuronal activity dynamics and network properties such as bursting and synchronization, options to combine multiple recordings and use a robust statistical framework to draw appropriate statistical inferences, and finally data visualizations and plots. In summary, meaRtools provides a platform for the analyses of singular and longitudinal MEA experiments.",

    "abstract": "The 20-item prosopagnosia index (PI20) is a self-report measure of face recognition ability, which is aimed to assess the risk for developmental prosopagnosia (DP), developed by Shah, Gaule, Sowden, Bird, and Cook (2015). Although they validated PI20 in several ways and it may serve as a quick and cost-effective measure for estimating DP risk (Livingston & Shah, in press; Shah et al., 2015), they did not formally evaluate its validity against a pre-existing alternative questionnaire (Kennerknecht et al., 2008) even though they criticized the weak relationship of the pre-existing questionnaire to actual behavioral face recognition performance. Thus, we administered the questionnaires to a large population (N = 855) and found a very strong correlation (r = 0.82 [95% confidence interval: 0.80, 0.84]), a principal component that accounted for more than 90% of the variance, and comparable reliability between the questionnaires. These results show unidimensionality and equivalence between the two questionnaires, or at least, a very strong common latent factor underlying them. The PI20 may not be greater than the pre-existing questionnaire; the two questionnaires measured essentially the same trait. The intrinsic equivalence between the questionnaires necessitates a revision of the view that the PI20 overcomes the weakness of the pre-existing questionnaire. Because both questionnaires contained unreliable items, we suggest, instead of using either questionnaire alone, that selection of a set of items with high reliability may offer a more robust approach to capture face recognition ability.",

    "abstract": "Multistage tumorigenesis is a dynamic process characterized by the accumulation of mutations. Thus, a tumor mass is composed of genetically divergent cell subclones. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing (NGS), mathematical models have been recently developed to decompose tumor subclonal architecture from a collective genome sequencing data. Most of the methods focused on single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). However, somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) also play critical roles in carcinogenesis. Therefore, further modeling subclonal CNAs composition would hold the promise to improve the analysis of tumor heterogeneity and cancer evolution. To address this issue, we developed a two-way mixture Poisson model, named CloneDeMix for the deconvolution of read-depth information. It can infer the subclonal copy number, mutational cellular prevalence (MCP), subclone composition, and the order in which mutations occurred in the evolutionary hierarchy. The performance of CloneDeMix was systematically assessed in simulations. As a result, the accuracy of CNA inference was nearly 93% and the MCP was also accurately restored. Furthermore, we also demonstrated its applicability using head and neck cancer samples from TCGA. Our results inform about the extent of subclonal CNA diversity, and a group of candidate genes that probably initiate lymph node metastasis during tumor evolution was also discovered. Most importantly, these driver genes are located at 11q13.3 which is highly susceptible to copy number change in head and neck cancer genomes. This study successfully estimates subclonal CNAs and exhibit the evolutionary relationships of mutation events. By doing so, we can track tumor heterogeneity and identify crucial mutations during evolution process. Hence, it facilitates not only understanding the cancer development but finding potential therapeutic targets. Briefly, this framework has implications for improved modeling of tumor evolution and the importance of inclusion of subclonal CNAs.",

However, this model is grounded largely in studies of behaviors that utilize hardwired neural pathways to link sensory input to motor output. To test whether this model applies to more flexible learning regimes that require arbitrary sensorimotor associations, we have developed a cerebellar-dependent motor learning paradigm compatible with both mesoscale and single dendrite resolution calcium imaging in mice. Here, we find that CFs are preferentially driven by and more time-locked to correctly executed movements and other task parameters that predict reward outcome, exhibiting widespread correlated activity within parasagittal processing zones that is governed by these predictions. Together, such CF activity patterns are well-suited to drive learning by providing predictive instructional input consistent with an unsigned reinforcement learning signal that does not rely exclusively on motor errors.",

    "abstract": "The recent advent of high throughput sequencing and genotyping technologies enables the comparison of patterns of polymorphisms at a very large number of markers. While the characterization of genetic structure from individual sequencing data remains expensive for many non-model species, it has been shown that sequencing pools of individual DNAs (Pool-seq) represents an attractive and cost-effective alternative. However, analyzing sequence read counts from a DNA pool instead of individual genotypes raises statistical challenges in deriving correct estimates of genetic differentiation. In this article, we provide a method-of-moments estimator of FST for Pool-seq data, based on an analysis-of-variance framework. We show, by means of simulations, that this new estimator is unbiased, and outperforms previously proposed estimators. We evaluate the robustness of our estimator to model misspecification, such as sequencing errors and uneven contributions of individual DNAs to the pools. Last, by reanalyzing published Pool-seq data of different ecotypes of the prickly sculpin Cottus asper, we show how the use of an unbiased FST estimator may question the interpretation of population structure inferred from previous analyses.",

However, the functional variants underlying these disease associations remain largely unknown. There is evidence that microRNA-mediated regulation may play an important role in this context. Therefore, we assessed whether autoimmune disease loci unfold their effects via altering microRNA expression in relevant immune cells.\\n\\nTo this end, we performed microRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses across 115 GWAS regions associated with 12 autoimmune diseases using next-generation sequencing data of 345 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Statistical analyses included the application and extension of a recently proposed framework (joint likelihood mapping), to microRNA expression data and microRNA target gene enrichment analyses of relevant GWAS data.\\n\\nOverall, only a minority of autoimmune disease risk loci may exert their pathophysiologic effects by altering miRNA expression based on JLIM. However, detailed functional fine-mapping revealed two independent GWAS regions harboring autoimmune disease risk SNPs with significant effects on microRNA expression. These relate to SNPs associated with Crohns disease (CD; rs102275) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; rs968567), which affect the expression of miR-1908-5p (prs102275=1.44e-20, prs968567=2.54e-14). In addition, an independent CD risk SNP, rs3853824, was found to alter the expression of miR-3614-5p (p=5.70e-7). To support these findings, we demonstrate that GWAS signals for RA and CD were enriched in genes predicted to be targeted by both miRNAs (all with p<0.05).\\n\\nIn summary, our study points towards a pathophysiological role of miR-1908-5p and miR- 3614-5p in autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "The accessibility of high-throughput phenotyping platforms in both the greenhouse and field, as well as the relatively low cost of unmanned aerial vehicles, have provided researchers with an effective means to characterize large populations throughout the growing season. These longitudinal phenotypes can provide important insight into plant development and responses to the environment. Despite the growing use of these new phenotyping approaches in plant breeding, the use of genomic prediction models for longitudinal phenotypes is limited in major crop species. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the utility of random regression (RR) models using Legendre polynomials for genomic prediction of shoot growth trajectories in rice (Oryza sativa). An estimate of shoot biomass, projected shoot area (PSA), was recored over a period of 20 days for a panel of 357 diverse rice accessions using an image-based greenhouse phenotyping platform. A RR that included a fixed second-order Legendre polynomial, a random second-order Legendre polynomial for the additive genetic effect, a first-order Legendre polynomial for the environmental effect, and heterogeneous residual variances was used to model PSA trajectories. The utility of the RR model over a single time point (TP) approach, where PSA is fit at each time point independently, is shown through four prediction scenarios. In the first scenario, the RR and TP approaches were used to predict PSA for a set of lines lacking phenotypic data. The RR approach showed a 11.6% increase in prediction accuracy over the TP approach. Much of this improvement could be attributed to the greater additive genetic variance captured by the RR approach. The remaining scenarios focused forecasting future phenotypes using a subset of early time points for known lines with phenotypic data, as well new lines lacking phenotypic data. In all cases, PSA could be predicted with high accuracy (r: 0.79 to 0.89 and 0.55 to 0.58 for known and unknown lines, respectively). This study provides the first application of RR models for genomic prediction of a longitudinal trait in rice, and demonstrates that RR models can be effectively used to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction for complex traits compared to a TP approach.",

    "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is a key component of human memory and cognition. Computational models have been used to study the underlying neural mechanisms, but neglected the important role of short- and long-term memory interactions (STM, LTM) for WM. Here, we investigate these using a novel multi-area spiking neural network model of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and two parieto-temporal cortical areas based on macaque data. We propose a WM indexing theory that explains how PFC could associate, maintain and update multi-modal LTM representations. Our simulations demonstrate how simultaneous, brief multi-modal memory cues could build a temporary joint memory representation as an \\\"index\\\" in PFC by means of fast Hebbian synaptic plasticity. This index can then reactivate spontaneously and thereby reactivate the associated LTM representations. Cueing one LTM item rapidly pattern-completes the associated un-cued item via PFC. The PFC-STM network updates flexibly as new stimuli arrive thereby gradually over-writing older representations.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present peptide-pair encoding (PPE), a general-purpose probabilistic segmentation of protein sequences into commonly occurring variable-length sub-sequences. The idea of PPE segmentation is inspired by the byte-pair encoding (BPE) text compression algorithm, which has recently gained popularity in subword neural machine translation. We modify this algorithm by adding a sampling framework allowing for multiple ways of segmenting a sequence. PPE segmentation steps can be learned over a large set of protein sequences (Swiss-Prot) or even a domain-specific dataset and then applied to a set of unseen sequences. This representation can be widely used as the input to any downstream machine learning tasks in protein bioinformatics. In particular, here, we introduce this representation through protein motif discovery and protein sequence embedding. (i) DiMotif: we present DiMotif as an alignment-free discriminative motif discovery method and evaluate the method for finding protein motifs in three different settings: (1) comparison of DiMotif with two existing approaches on 20 distinct motif discovery problems which are experimentally verified, (2) classification-based approach for the motifs extracted for integrins, integrin-binding proteins, and biofilm formation, and (3) in sequence pattern searching for nuclear localization signal. The DiMotif, in general, obtained high recall scores, while having a comparable F1 score with other methods in the discovery of experimentally verified motifs. Having high recall suggests that the DiMotif can be used for short-list creation for further experimental investigations on motifs. In the classification-based evaluation, the extracted motifs could reliably detect the integrins, integrin-binding, and biofilm formation-related proteins on a reserved set of sequences with high F1 scores. (ii) ProtVecX: we extend k-mer based protein vector (ProtVec) embedding to variable-length protein embedding using PPE sub-sequences. We show that the new method of embedding can marginally outperform ProtVec in enzyme prediction as well as toxin prediction tasks. In addition, we conclude that the embeddings are beneficial in protein classification tasks when they are combined with raw k-mer features.\\n\\nAvailabilityImplementations of our method will be available under the Apache 2 licence at http://llp.berkeley.edu/dimotif and http://llp.berkeley.edu/protvecx.",

    "abstract": "Pathogens continuously adapt to changing host environments where variation in their virulence and antigenicity is critical to their long-term evolutionary success. The emergence of novel variants is accelerated in microbial mutator strains (mutators) deficient in DNA repair genes, most often from mismatch repair and oxidised-guanine repair systems (MMR and OG respectively). Bacterial MMR/OG mutants are abundant in clinical samples and show increased adaptive potential in experimental infection models, yet the role of mutators in the epidemiology and evolution of infectious disease is not well understood. Here we investigated the role of mutation rate dynamics in the evolution of a broad host range pathogen, Streptococcus iniae, using a set of 80 strains isolated globally over 40 years. We have resolved phylogenetic relationships using non-recombinant core genome variants, measured in vivo mutation rates by fluctuation analysis, identified variation in major MMR/OG genes and their regulatory regions, and phenotyped the major traits determining virulence in streptococci. We found that both mutation rate and MMR/OG genotype are remarkably conserved within phylogenetic clades but significantly differ between major phylogenetic lineages. Further, variation in MMR/OG loci correlates with occurrence of atypical virulence-associated phenotypes, infection in atypical hosts (mammals), and atypical tissue of a vaccinated primary hosts (barramundi bone). These findings suggest that mutators are likely to facilitate adaptations preceding major diversification events, and may promote emergence of variation permitting colonisation of a novel host tissue, novel host taxa (host jumps), and immune-escape in the vaccinated host.",

However, the factors involved in microbial community assembly during formation of granules are poorly understood and little is known about the reproducibility in treatment performance and community structure. Here we show that both deterministic and stochastic factors exert a dynamic influence during microbial community assembly into granular sludge. During granulation, the microbial communities in three replicate sequencing batch reactors followed similar successional trajectories of the most abundant taxa and showed similar dynamics in diversity. Deterministic factors dominated the assembly of the most abundant community members as the microbial community transitioned from floccular to granular form. Stochastic factors mostly affected rare members of the communities and caused the microbial community structure to diverge in one of the reactors; however, this did not have an impact on the treatment performance. This demonstrates that the reactor function and the dynamics of the most abundant community members are in fact reproducible during the formation of aerobic granules.",

The European mitochondrial haplogroup K has previously been reported to be increased in frequency in centenarians and nonagenarians relative to its frequency in younger individuals, by standard case/control study designs. To select for mitochondrial genomes likely to carry beneficial genetic variants, we screened a large genealogical database (the Utah Population Database, UPDB) for mitochondrial lineages in which the frequency of survival past 90 years was significantly higher than in the general population, and also significantly higher than in close non-matrilineal relatives. We ranked 14,900 distinct matrilineages by the strength of their association with longevity. Full sequencing of the mtDNAs from a single individual from each of 53 matrilineages in the top longevity ranks and each of 374 control matrilineages from the general Utah population, followed by analyses of the mtDNA haplogroup frequencies, identified haplogroup K2 as the haplogroup most enriched in frequency by the longevity selection (Odds Ratio = 23.05). We then analyzed overall survival and cause-specific mortality in the several thousand individuals aged 40 years or older whose mtDNA genotypes could be imputed from the 374 fully sequenced control mtDNAs. In these control matrilineages Haplogroup K2 individuals (n=332) enjoyed a significantly lower all-cause mortality risk than the general population (HR=0.81), attributable in part to a significantly lower risk of dying from heart disease (HR=0.50), as well as lower (though not significantly lower) risks of dying from cancer (HR=0.72) and diabetes (HR=0.74). Furthermore, K2 was the only haplogroup in which mortality was reduced for all three of these common causes of death.",

While gef1 and scd1 mutants exhibit distinct phenotypes, how they do so is unclear given that they activate the same GTPase. Using the GEF localization pattern during cytokinesis as a paradigm, we report a novel interplay between Gef1 and Scd1 that spatially modulates Cdc42. We find that Gef1 promotes Scd1 localization to the division site during cytokinesis and to the new end during polarized growth through the recruitment of the scaffold Scd2 via a Cdc42 feedforward pathway. Gef1-mediated Scd1 recruitment at the new end enables the transition from monopolar to bipolar growth. Reciprocally, Scd1 restricts Gef1 localization to prevent ectopic Cdc42 activation during cytokinesis to promote cell separation and during interphase to maintain cell shape. Our findings reveal an elegant regulatory pattern in which Gef1 establishes new sites of Scd1-mediated Cdc42 activity, while Scd1 restricts Gef1 to functional sites. We propose that crosstalk between GEFs is a conserved mechanism that orchestrates Cdc42 activation during complex cellular processes.\\n\\nSummary StatementCdc42 GEFs Gef1 and Scd1 crosstalk to fine-tune Cdc42 activity.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) usage has rapidly increased in the last few decades due to their unique properties, exploited in various industrial and commercial products. Certain types of CNTs cause adverse health effects, including chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Despite the large number of in vitro and in vivo studies evaluating these effects, many important questions remain unanswered due to a lack of mechanistic understanding of how CNTs induce cellular stress responses. In order to predict CNT toxicity, it is important to understand which transcriptional programs are specifically activated in response to CNTs, and what similarities and differences exist in relation to other toxic inducers exerting similar adverse effects.\\n\\nResultsA systems biology approach was applied to reveal complex interactions at the molecular level in mouse lung tissue in response to different fibrosis inducers: two types of multi-walled CNTs, NM-401 and NRCWE-26, and bleomycin (BLM). Based on mRNA gene expression profiles, we inferred gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to capture functional hierarchical regulatory structures between genes and their regulators. We found that activities of the transcription factors (TFs) Myc, Arid5a and Mxd1 were associated with the regulation of cytokine transcription in response to CNTs, while in response to BLM treatment, Myc was associated with p53 signaling. TF Litaf was identified as the essential regulator for noncanonical signaling of TLR2/4 driven by CNTs. Despite the different nature of the lung injury caused by CNTs and BLM, we identified common stress response modules, that included DNA damage (TFs: E2f8, E2f1, Foxm1), M1/M2 macrophage polarization (TF: Mafb), Interferon response (TFs: Irf7, Stat2 and Irf9) for all agents.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results suggest that the reconstruction and analysis of TF-centric gene interaction networks can reveal key targets and regulators of cellular stress responses to toxic agents.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in annotating the genome with experimental methods, much of the regulatory noncoding genome remains poorly defined. Here we assert that regulatory elements may be characterized by leveraging local epigenomic signatures at sites where specific transcription factors (TFs) are bound. To link these two identifying features, we introduce IMPACT, a genome annotation strategy which identifies regulatory elements defined by cell-state-specific TF binding profiles, learned from 515 chromatin and sequence annotations. We validate IMPACT using multiple compelling applications. First, IMPACT predicts TF motif binding with high accuracy (average AUC 0.92, s.e. 0.03; across 8 TFs), a significant improvement (all p<6.9e-15) over intersecting motifs with open chromatin (average AUC 0.66, s.e. 0.11). Second, an IMPACT annotation trained on RNA polymerase II is more enriched for peripheral blood cis-eQTL variation (N=3,754) than sequence based annotations, such as promoters and regions around the TSS, (permutation p<1e-3, 25% average increase in enrichment). Third, integration with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) summary statistics from European (N=38,242) and East Asian (N=22,515) populations revealed that the top 5% of CD4+ Treg IMPACT regulatory elements capture 85.7% (s.e. 19.4%) of RA h2 (p<1.6e-5) and that the top 9.8% of Treg IMPACT regulatory elements, consisting of all SNPs with a non-zero annotation value, capture 97.3% (s.e. 18.2%) of RA h2 (p<7.6e-7), the most comprehensive explanation for RA h2 to date. In comparison, the average RA h2 captured by compared CD4+ T histone marks is 42.3% and by CD4+ T specifically expressed gene sets is 36.4%. Finally, integration with RA fine-mapping data (N=27,345) revealed a significant enrichment (2.87, p<8.6e-3) of putatively causal variants across 20 RA associated loci in the top 1% of CD4+ Treg IMPACT regulatory regions. Overall, we find that IMPACT generalizes well to other cell types in identifying complex trait associated regulatory elements.",

    "abstract": "Translational and post-translational control mechanisms in the cell result in widely observable differences between measured gene transcription and protein abundances. Herein, protein complexes are among the most tightly controlled entities by selective degradation of their individual proteins. They furthermore act as control hubs that regulate highly important processes in the cell and exhibit a high functional diversity due to their ability to change their composition and their structure. To better understand and predict these functional states, extensive characterization of complex composition, behavior, and abundance is necessary. Mass spectrometry provides an unbiased approach to directly determine protein abundances across cell populations and thus to profile a comprehensive abundance map of proteins. We investigated the behavior of protein subunits in known complexes by comparing their abundance profiles across up to 140 cell types available in ProteomicsDB. After thorough assessment of different randomization methods and statistical scoring algorithms, we developed a computational tool to quantify the significance of concurrent profiles within a complex, therefore providing insights into the conservation of their composition across human cell types. We identified the intrinsic structures in complex behavior that allow to determine which proteins orchestrate complex function. This analysis can be extended to investigate common profiles within arbitrary protein groups. With the CoExpresso web service, we offer a potent scoring scheme to assess proteins for their co-regulation and thereby offer insight into their potential for forming functional groups like protein complexes. CoExpresso can be accessed through http://computproteomics/Apps/CoExpresso. Source code and R scripts for database generation are available at https://bitbucket.org/veitveit/coexpresso.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMany proteins form multi-functional assemblies called protein complexes instead of working as singly units. These complexes control most processes in the cell making the full characterization of their behavior inevitable to understand cellular control mechanisms. Detailed knowledge about complex behavior will elucidate biomarkers and drug targets that exhibit and correct aberrant cell states, respectively. We investigated abundance changes of the protein complex components over more than 100 different human cell types. By using statistical scoring models, we estimated the evidence for the co-regulation of the proteins and revealed which proteins form subunits with impact on complex function and composition. By providing the interactive web service CoExpresso, any combination of proteins can be tested for their co-regulation in human cells.",

    "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), preferentially transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, is an emerging pathogen around the world and causes significant morbidity in patients. A single amino acid mutation in the envelope protein of CHIKV has led to shift in vector preference towards Aedes albopictus, an invasive mosquito. Previous studies have shown that after infection, mosquitoes mount an antiviral immune response. However, molecular interactions during the course of infection at different tissues and time-points remain largely uncharacterised. Here we performed whole transcriptome analysis on dissected midguts and head/thorax of CHIKV (Indian Ocean strain) infected Aedes albopictus to identify differentially expressed genes compared with uninfected controls. For this, RNA was extracted at two days post-infection (D2) from pooled midguts and eight days post-infection (D8) from heads and the anterior 1/3rd of the thorax. We identified 25 and 96 differentially expressed genes from the D2 and D8 samples respectively (p-value <0.05). Custom de novo transcriptomes were assembled for the reads that did not align with the reference genome and an additional 225 and 4771 differentially expressed genes from D2 and D8, respectively, were identified. Twenty-two of the identified transcripts, possibly involved in immunity, were validated by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, we also detected changes in viral diversity, as shown by number of mutations in the viral genome, with increase in number of mutations in the midgut compared with mammalian host (Vero cell culture), followed by reduction in the number of mutations in head and thorax at D8, indicating a possible genomic bottleneck. Taken together, these results will help in understanding Aedes Albopictus interactions with CHIKV and can be utilised to reduce the impact of this viral infection.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryChikungunya virus has caused several outbreaks around the world in the last decade. Once a relatively unknown virus, it now causes seasonal infections in tropical and some temperate regions. This change in epidemiology is attributed to vector switch from Aedes aegypti to Aedes albopictus, an invasive pest leading to spread and causing infections in temperate regions. Although recent research has identified mosquito factors influencing infections, our understanding of interaction between chikungunya virus and its vector is limited. Using whole transcriptome sequencing of chikungunya infected mosquitoes, we identified differentially expressed genes in the midgut and head and thorax, over the course of mosquito infection. We also detected changes in the viral genome during mosquito infection and a possible genetic bottleneck event with reduction in viral variants at the head and thorax region of mosquito in the later stages of infection. These results will lead to improving our understanding of mosquito-virus interactions with Aedes albopictus as a vector and in turn lead to development of novel disease control strategies.",

This observation, and the finding that individuals with ASD tend to  see the trees before the forest when performing the Navon task2, has led to the proposal that ASD is characterized by a bias towards processing local image details3. However, it remains to be shown that natural image recognition in individuals with autism depends more on fine image detail. Here, we resolve this issue by showing that natural image recognition relies more on details in individuals with an above-median number of autistic traits. Furthermore, we found that reliance on details was best predicted by the presence of the most clinically relevant autistic traits. Therefore, our findings raise the possibility that a wide range of real-life abilities and difficulties associated with ASD are related to an enhanced reliance on visual details.",

The E. coli protein-biotin ligase BirA biotinylates a lysine within a synthetic biotin acceptor peptide (AP) and allow for specific tagging of proteins fused to the AP. The approach is not applicable to unmodified proteins, and we sought to develop an effective selection system that could form the basis for directed evolution of novel BirA variants with specificity towards unmodified proteins. The system was based on bacterial display of a target peptide sequence, which could be biotinylated by cytosolic BirA variants before being displayed on the surface. In a model selection, the bacterial display system accomplished >1.000.000 enrichment in a single selection step. A randomly mutated BirA library was used to identify novel variants. Bacteria displaying peptide sequences from 13 out of 14 tested proteins were strongly enriched after 3-5 selection rounds. Moreover, a clone selected for biotinylation of a C-terminal peptide from red-fluorescent protein TagRFP showed site-specific biotinylation. Thus, active BirA variants with novel specificity are effectively isolated with our bacterial display system and provides a basis for the development of BirA variants for site-selective biotinylation.",

    "abstract": "In many biological settings, two or more cells come into physical contact to form a cell-cell interface. In some cases, the cell-cell contact must be transient, forming on timescales of seconds. One example is offered by the T cell, an immune cell which must attach to the surface of other cells in order to decipher information about disease. The aspect ratio of these interfaces (tens of nanometers thick and tens of micrometers in diameter) puts them into the thin-layer limit, or \\\"lubrication limit\\\", of fluid dynamics. A key question is how the receptors and ligands on opposing cells come into contact. What are the relative roles of thermal undulations of the plasma membrane and deterministic forces from active filopodia? We use a computational fluid dynamics algorithm capable of simulating 10-nanometer-scale fluid-structure interactions with thermal fluctuations up to seconds-and microns-scales. We use this to simulate two opposing membranes, variously including thermal fluctuations, active forces, and membrane permeability. In some regimes dominated by thermal fluctuations, proximity is a rare event, which we capture by computing mean first-passage times using a Weighted Ensemble rare-event computational method. Our results demonstrate that the time-to-contact increases for smaller cell-cell distances (where the thin-layer effect is strongest), leading to an optimal initial cell-cell separation for fastest receptor-ligand binding. We reproduce a previous experimental observation that fluctuation spatial scales are largely unaffected, but timescales are dramatically slowed, by the thin-layer effect. We also find that membrane permeability would need to be above physiological levels to abrogate the thin-layer effect.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe elastohydrodynamics of water in and around cells is playing an increasingly recognized role in biology. In this work, we investigate the flow of extracellular fluid in between cells during the formation of a cell-cell contact, to determine whether its necessary evacuation as the cells approach is a rate-limiting step before molecules on either cell can interact. To overcome the computational challenges associated with simulating fluid in this mechanically soft, stochastic and high-aspect-ratio environment, we extend a computational framework where the cell plasma membranes are treated as immersed boundaries in the fluid, and combine this with computational methods for simulating stochastic rare events in which an ensemble of simulations are given weights according to their probability. We find that the internal dynamics of the membranes has speeds in approximately microseconds, but that as the cells approach, a new slow timescale of approximately milliseconds is introduced. Thermal undulations nor typical amounts of membrane permeability can overcome the timescale, but active forces, e.g., from the cytoskeleton, can. Our results suggest an explanation for differences in molecular interactions in live cells compared to in vitro reconstitution experiments.",

    "abstract": "The tumor suppressor protein p53 compiles information about cellular stressors to make decisions on whether the cell should survive or undergo apoptosis. However, the p53 response depends on the source of damage, displaying a  digital oscillatory response after ionizing radiation (IR) damage and a proportional non-oscillatory response following UV damage. We propose a mathematical model that qualitatively replicates this observed behavior. The difference in p53 dynamics in the model results from two mechanisms: IR damage is fully detected minutes after exposure while UV damage is detected over several hours; and the p53-controlled transcriptional response is dominated by inactive p53 following UV damage. In particular, we hypothesize that an unidentified positive feedback loop controlled by inactive p53 is required to maintain the qualitative high p53 response to UV damage. This work proposes an explanation for two distinct responses of p53 to DNA damage and how each response can lead to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe propose a mathematical model hypothesizing how the tumor suppressor protein p53 produces two contrasting dynamical responses in response to different types of DNA damage. In particular, we predict the existence of a positive feedback loop controlled by the inactive form of p53, which allows the cell to respond to slowly detected damage. The existence of differing dynamic responses by p53 has implications for our understanding of tumor development and possibly p53-related therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "In the Endopterygote Drosophila melanogaster, Zelda is a key activator of the zygotic genome during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). Zelda binds cis-regulatory elements (TAGteam heptamers), and makes chromatin accessible for gene transcription. Recently, Zelda has been studied in two other Endopterygotes: Apis mellifera and Tribolium castaneum, and the Paraneopteran Rhodnius prolixus. We have studied Zelda in the cockroach Blattella germanica, a hemimetabolan, short germ-band, and Polyneopteran species. Zelda protein of B. germanica has the complete set of functional domains, which is typical of lower insects. The TAGteam heptamers of D. melanogaster have been found in the B. germanica genome, and the canonical one, CAGGTAG, is present at a similar relative number in the genome of these two species and in the genome of other insects, suggesting that, although within certain evolutionary constraints, the genome admits as many CAGGTAG motifs as its length allows. Zelda-depleted embryos of B. germanica show defects involving the blastoderm formation and the abdomen development and have genes contributing to these processes down-regulated. We conclude that in B. germanica Zelda strictly activates the zygotic genome, within the MZT, a role conserved in more derived Endopterygote insects. In B. germanica, Zelda is expressed during MZT, whereas in D. melanogaster and T. castaneum it is expressed well beyond this transition. Moreover, in these species and A. mellifera, Zelda has functions even in postembryonic development. The expansion of Zelda expression and functions beyond the MZT in holometabolan species might have been instrumental for the evolutionary transition from hemimetaboly to holometaboly. In particular, the expression of Zelda beyond the MZT during embryogenesis might have allowed building the morphologically divergent holometabolan larva.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn early insect embryo development, the protein Zelda is a key activator of the zygotic genome during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. This has been thoroughly demonstrated in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, as well as in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, both species belonging to the most modified clade of endopterygote insects, showing complete (holometabolan) metamorphosis. In these species, Zelda is expressed and have functions in early embryogenesis, in late embryogenesis and in postembryonic stages. We have studied Zelda in the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, which belong to the less modified clade of polyneopteran insects, showing an incomplete (hemimetabolan) metamorphosis. In B. germanica, Zelda is significantly expressed in early embryogenesis, being a key activator of the zygotic genome during the maternal-to-zygotic transition, as in the fruit fly and the red flour beetle. Nevertheless, Zelda is not significantly expressed, and presumably has no functions, in late embryogenesis and in postembryonic stages of the cockroach. The data suggest that the ancestral function of Zelda in insects with hemimetabolan metamorphosis was to activate the zygotic genome, a function circumscribed to early embryogenesis. The expansion of Zelda expression and functions to late embryogenesis and postembryonic stages might have been a key step in the evolutionary transition from hemimetaboly to holometaboly. In hemimetabolan species embryogenesis produces a nymph displaying the essential adult body structure. In contrast, embryogenesis of holometabolan species produces a larva that is morphologically very divergent from the adult. Expression of Zelda in late embryogenesis might have been a key step in the evolution from hemimetaboly to holometaboly, since it would have allowed the building the morphologically divergent holometabolan larva.",

However, the actual temporal error can be difficult to perceive: imagine a baseball batter that swings and misses a fastball. Here we show that in such situations people can use an internal error signal to make corrections in the next trial. This signal is based on the discrepancy between the actual and the planned action onset time: the prediction error. In this study, we used three interception tasks: reaching movements, saccadic eye movements and a button press that released a cursor moving ballistically for a fixed time. We found that action onset depended on the previous temporal error in the arm movement experiment only and not in the saccadic and button press experiments. However, this dependency was modulated by the movement time: faster arm movements depended less on the previous actual temporal error. An analysis using a Kalman filter confirmed that people used the prediction error rather than the previous temporal error for trial-by-trial corrections in fast arm movements, saccades and button press.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous waves in the developing retina are essential in the formation of the retinotopic mapping in the visual system. From experiments in rabbits, it is known that the earliest type of retinal waves (stage I) is nucleated spontaneously, propagates at a speed of 451{+/-}91 m/sec and relies on gap junction coupling between ganglion cells. Because gap junctions (electrical synapses) have short integration times, it has been argued that they cannot set the low speed of stage I retinal waves. Here, we present a theoretical study of a two-dimensional neural network of the ganglion cell layer with gap junction coupling and intrinsic noise. We demonstrate that this model can explain observed nucleation rates as well as the comparatively slow propagation speed of the waves. From the interaction between two coupled neurons, we estimate the wave speed in the model network. Furthermore, using simulations of small networks of neurons (N[&le;]260), we estimate the nucleation rate in form of an Arrhenius escape rate. These results allow for informed simulations of a realistically sized network, yielding values of the gap junction coupling and the intrinsic noise level that are in a physiologically plausible range.\\n\\nAuthor summaryRetinal waves are a prominent example of spontaneous activity that is observed in neuronal systems of many different species during development. Spatio-temporally correlated bursts travel across the retina at a few hundred m/sec to facilitate the maturation of the underlying neuronal circuits. Even at the earliest stage, in which the network merely consists of ganglion cells coupled by electric synapses (gap junctions), it is unclear which mechanisms are responsible for wave nucleation and transmission speed. We propose a model of gap-junction coupled noisy neurons, in which waves emerge from rare stochastic fluctuations in single cells and the waves transmission speed is set by the latency of the burst onset in response to gap-junction currents between neighboring cells.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are associated with a variety of cancers. Therefore, it is important to know the occurrence and the prognostic effects of TP53 mutations in certain cancers. Over 29,000 cases of TP53 mutations were obtained from the April 2016 release of the Internal Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) TP53 Database, and 7,893 cancer cases were compiled in the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics from the 33 most recent studies of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The data was analyzed, and it was found that the majority of TP53 mutations were missense and the major mutational hotspots were located at codons 248, 273, 175, and 245 in exons 4-8 for somatic mutations with the addition of codon 337 and other mutations in exons 9-10 for germline mutations. Out of 33 TGCA studies, the effects of TP53 mutations were statistically significant in ten cancers (ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), papillary RCC, chromophobe RCC, uterine endometrial carcinoma, and thymoma) for survival time and in six cancers (ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, chromophobe RCC, acute myeloid leukemia, and thymoma) for disease-free survival time. Also, it was found that the most common p53 mutation in hepatocellular carcinomas (R249S) was a much better indicator for poor prognosis than TP53 mutations as a whole.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe TP53 gene codes for the tumor suppressor protein, p53, which is essential for DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. It is commonly inactivated or partially disabled by mutations, contributing to the development of a variety of human cancers. In this study, over 29,000 cases from the April 2016 release of the International Agency for Research on Cancer TP53 Database (IARC) were analyzed to determine the distribution of mutations in the TP53 gene. Data was also collected from the 33 most recent The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies to determine the prevalence of TP53 mutations in cancers and their effects on survival and disease-free survival time. It was found that there were statistically significant differences between cases with and without TP53 mutations in ten cancers when comparing survival time, and in six cancers when comparing disease-free survival time. This indicates that TP53 mutations are potential prognostic markers that can be used to further improve the accuracy of predicting the survival time and disease-free survival time of cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "MotivationHigh-throughput sequencing of large immune repertoires has enabled the development of methods to predict the probability of generation by V(D)J recombination of T- and B-cell receptors of any specific nucleotide sequence. These generation probabilities are very non-homogeneous, ranging over 20 orders of magnitude in real repertoires. Since the function of a receptor really depends on its protein sequence, it is important to be able to predict this probability of generation at the amino acid level. However, brute-force summation over all the nucleotide sequences with the correct amino acid translation is computationally intractable. The purpose of this paper is to present a solution to this problem.\\n\\nResultsWe use dynamic programming to construct an efficient and flexible algorithm, called OLGA (Optimized Likelihood estimate of immunoGlobulin Amino-acid sequences), for calculating the probability of generating a given CDR3 amino acid sequence or motif, with or without V/J restriction, as a result of V(D)J recombination in B or T cells. We apply it to databases of epitope-specific T-cell receptors to evaluate the probability that a typical human subject will possess T cells responsive to specific disease-associated epitopes. The model prediction shows an excellent agreement with published data. We suggest that OLGA may be a useful tool to guide vaccine design.\\n\\nAvailabilitySource code is available at https://github.com/zsethna/OLGA",

    "abstract": "Substrates of most transport proteins have not been identified, limiting our understanding of their role in physiology and disease. Traditional identification methods use transport assays with radioactive compounds, but they are technically challenging and many compounds are unavailable in radioactive form or are prohibitively expensive, precluding large-scale trials. Here, we present a high-throughput screening method that can identify candidate substrates from libraries of unlabeled compounds. The assay is based on the principle that transport proteins recognize substrates through specific interactions, which lead to enhanced stabilization of the transporter population in thermostability shift assays. Representatives of three different transporter (super)families were tested, which differ in structure as well as transport and ion coupling mechanisms. In each case, the substrates were identified correctly from a large set of chemically related compounds, including stereo-isoforms. In some cases, stabilization by substrate binding was enhanced further by ions, providing testable hypotheses on energy coupling mechanisms.",

However, whether integrative information about genomic sequencing and related clinical interpretation may benefit Chinese cancer patients with stage IV disease to date has not investigated.\\n\\nMethodsTargeted gene panel and whole exome of tumor/blood samples in > 1,000 Chinese cancer patients were sequenced. Then we provided patients and their oncologists with the sequencing results and a clinical recommendation roadmap based on evidence-based medicine, defined as CWES. Only patients with stage IV disease who failed the previous treatment upon receiving the CWES reports were included for analyzing the impact of CWES on clinical outcomes in 1-year follow-ups.\\n\\nResultsWe identified the mutational signatures of 953 Chinese cancer patients, with some being unique. Approximately 88.6% of patients had clinically actionable somatic genomic alterations. We successfully followed up 22 stage IV patients. Of these, 11 patients treatment followed the CWES reports defined as group A. Eleven patients received the next treatment, but did not follow the CWES suggestions, and are defined as group B. The types of therapies before CWES were similar in the two groups. The median PFS of group A was 12 months and 45% patients failed this round of therapy. The median PFS of group B was 4 months and 91% of patients failed the treatment.\\n\\nConclusionThe current study suggested that CWES has the potential to help explore the clinical benefits in multiple line therapies among advanced stage tumor patients.",

    "abstract": "Inferring molecular interaction networks from genomics data is important for advancing our understanding of biological processes. Whereas considerable research effort has been placed on inferring such networks from gene expression data, network estimation from DNA methylation data has received very little attention due to the substantially higher dimensionality and complications with result interpretation for non-genic regions. To combat these challenges, we propose here an approach based on sparse latent Gaussian graphical model (SLGGM). The core idea is to perform network estimation on q latent variables as opposed to d CpG sites, with q<<d. To impose a correspondence between the latent variables and genes, we use the distance between CpG sites and transcription starting sites of the genes to generate a prior on the CpG sites latent class membership. We evaluate this approach on synthetic data, and show on real data that the gene network estimated from DNA methylation data significantly explains gene expression patterns in unseen datasets.",

Here we show that Amphiregulin functions by releasing bio-active TGFb from latent complexes via integrin-v activation. Using acute injury models in two different tissues, we found that by inducing TGFb activation on mesenchymal stromal cells (aka pericytes), Amphiregulin induced their differentiation into myo-fibroblasts, thereby selectively contributing to the restoration of vascular barrier function within injured tissue. Furthermore, we identified macrophages as a critical source of Amphiregulin, revealing a direct effector mechanism by which these cells contribute to tissue restoration following acute injury. Combined, these observations expose a so far under-appreciated mechanism of how cells of the immune system selectively control the differentiation of tissue progenitor cells during tissue repair and inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular bacterium and the etiological agent of Q fever. Successful host cell infection requires the Coxiella Type IVB Secretion System (T4BSS), which translocates bacterial effector proteins across the vacuole membrane into the host cytoplasm, where they manipulate a variety of cell processes. To identify host cell targets of Coxiella T4BSS effector proteins, we determined the transcriptome of murine alveolar macrophages infected with a Coxiella T4BSS effector mutant. We identified a set of inflammatory genes that are significantly upregulated in T4BSS mutant-infected cells compared to mock-infected cells or cells infected with wild type (WT) bacteria, suggesting Coxiella T4BSS effector proteins downregulate expression of these genes. In addition, the IL-17 signaling pathway was identified as one of the top pathways affected by the bacteria. While previous studies demonstrated that IL-17 plays a protective role against several pathogens, the role of IL-17 during Coxiella infection is unknown. We found that IL-17 kills intracellular Coxiella in a dose-dependent manner, with the T4BSS mutant exhibiting significantly more sensitivity to IL-17 than WT bacteria. In addition, quantitative PCR confirmed increased expression of IL-17 downstream signaling genes in T4BSS mutant-infected cells compared to WT or mock-infected cells, including the pro-inflammatory cytokines I11a, Il1b and Tnfa, the chemokines Cxcl2 and Ccl5, and the antimicrobial protein Lcn2. We further confirmed that the Coxiella T4BSS downregulates macrophage CXCL2/MIP-2 and CCL5/RANTES protein levels following IL-17 stimulation. Together, these data suggest that Coxiella downregulates IL-17 signaling in a T4BSS-dependent manner in order to escape the macrophage immune response.",

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous signaling molecule, may regulate various physiological processes in plants. However, whether H2S has regulatory effect in this symbiotic system remains unknown. Herein, we investigated the possible role of H2S in the symbiosis between soybean (Glycine max) and rhizobium (Sinorhizobium fredii). Our results demonstrated that exogenous H2S donor (sodium hydrosulfide, NaHS) treatment promoted soybean growth, nodulation and nitrogenase (Nase) activity. Western blotting analysis revealed that the abundance of nitrogenase component nifH was increased by NaHS treatment in nodules. Quantitative real-time PCR data showed that NaHS treatment up-regulated the expressions of symbiosis-related genes nodC and nodD of S. fredii. Besides, expression of soybean nodulation marker genes including early nodulin 40 (GmENOD40), ERF required for nodulation (GmERN), nodulation signaling pathway2b (GmNSP2b) and nodulation inception genes (GmNIN1a, GmNIN2a and GmNIN2b) were up-regulated. Moreover, the expressions of glutamate synthase (GmGS), nitrite reductase (GmNiR), ammonia transporter (GmSAT1), and nifH involved in nitrogen metabolism were up-regulated in NaHS-treated soybean roots and nodules. Together, our results suggested that H2S may act as a positive signaling molecule in soybean-rhizobia symbiotic system and enhance their nitrogen fixation ability.\\n\\nHighlightWe demonstrated for the first time that H2S as a signaling molecule may promote the establishment of symbiotic relationship and nitrogen fixation ability in the soybean-rhizobia symbiotic system.",

    "abstract": "Computational strategies aimed at unveiling the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR) activation require extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the receptor embedded in an explicit lipid-water environment. A possible method for efficiently sampling the conformational space of such a complex system is metadynamics (MetaD) with path collective variables (CV). Here, we applied well-tempered MetaD with path CVs to one of the few GPCRs for which both inactive and fully active experimental structures are available, the -opioid receptor (MOR), and assessed the ability of this enhanced sampling method to estimate thermodynamic properties of receptor activation in line with those obtained by more computationally expensive adaptive sampling protocols. While n-body information theory (nBIT) analysis of these simulations confirmed that MetaD can efficiently characterize ligand-induced allosteric communication across the receptor, standard MetaD cannot be used directly to derive kinetic rates because transitions are accelerated by a bias potential. Applying the principle of Maximum Caliber (MaxCal) to the free-energy landscape of morphine-bound MOR reconstructed from MetaD, we obtained Markov State Models (MSMs) that yield kinetic rates of MOR activation in agreement with those obtained by adaptive sampling. Taken together, these results suggest that the MetaD-MaxCal combination creates an efficient strategy for estimating thermodynamic and kinetic properties of GPCR activation at an affordable computational cost.",

This environmental and genetic heterogeneity can substantially influence population and community resilience to disturbance events. Here, we investigated corals from the highly variable back reef habitats of Ofu Island in American Samoa that thrive in thermal conditions known to elicit widespread bleaching and mortality elsewhere. To investigate the hypothesis that thermal variability is the driving force shaping previously observed differences in coral tolerance limits in Ofu, specimens of the common Indo-Pacific coral Porites lobata (Dana, 1846) from locations with differing levels of thermal variability were acclimated to low and high thermal variation in controlled common garden experimental aquaria. Overall, there was minimal effect of the acclimation exposure. Corals native to the site with the highest level of daily variability grew fastest, regardless of acclimation treatment. When exposed to lethal thermal stress, corals native to both variable sites contained elevated levels of heat shock proteins and maintained photosynthetic performance for 1-2 days longer than corals from the stable environment. Despite being separated by < 5 km, there was significant genetic differentiation among coral colonies (FST = 0.206, p < 0.0001; nuclear ribosomal DNA), while Symbiodinium phylotypes were all ITS2-type C15. Our study demonstrates consistent signatures of adaptation in growth and stress resistance in corals from naturally thermally variable habitats, emphasizing that existing genetic diversity of corals is an important asset in strategies to protect and manage coral reef ecosystems in the face of global change.\\n\\nSummary StatementCorals native to highly variable habitats demonstrate greater thermal tolerance than corals from less variable habitats after 36-days of acclimation to thermally stable or variable common garden treatments.",

    "abstract": "Reactive microglia and infiltrating peripheral monocytes have been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases of the retina and central nervous system (CNS). However, their specific contribution in retinal degeneration remains unclear. We recently showed that peripheral monocytes that infiltrate the retina after ocular injury in mice become permanently engrafted into the tissue, establishing a pro-inflammatory phenotype that promotes neurodegeneration. Here, we show in mice that microglia regulate the process of neuroglia remodeling during ocular injury, and their depletion results in marked upregulation of inflammatory markers, such as Il17f, Tnfsf11, Ccl4, Il1a, Ccr2, Il4, Il5, and Csf2 in the retina, abnormal engraftment of peripheral CCR2+ CX3CR1+ monocytes into the retina and is associated with increased retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss, retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, and RPE65+ cell migration onto the retinal surface. Furthermore, we show that other types of ocular injuries, such as penetrating corneal trauma and ocular hypertension, also cause similar changes. However, optic nerve crush injury mediated RGC loss evokes neither peripheral monocyte response in the retina, nor RPE65+ cell migration, although peripheral CX3CR1+ and CCR2+ monocytes infiltrate the optic nerve injury site and remain present for months. Our study suggests that microglia are key regulators of peripheral monocyte infiltration and RPE migration and their depletion results in abnormal neuroglia remodeling that exacerbates neuroretinal tissue damage. This mechanism of retinal damage through neuroglia remodeling may be clinically important for the treatment of patients with ocular injuries, including surgical traumas.",

We show that boundaries of infection foci are irregular and dominated by rare pioneer bacteria that spread farther than the rest. We extend our quantitative model for bacterial spread to show that heterogeneous spreading behavior can improve the chances of creating a persistent L. monocytogenes infection in an actively extruding epithelium.

    "abstract": "Identifying driver genes is a central problem in cancer biology, and many methods have been developed to identify driver genes from somatic mutation data. However, existing methods either lack explicit statistical models, or rely on very simple models that do not capture complex features in somatic mutations of driver genes. Here, we present driverMAPS (Model-based Analysis of Positive Selection), a more comprehensive model-based approach to driver gene identification. This new method explicitly models, at the single-base level, the effects of positive selection in cancer driver genes as well as highly heterogeneous background mutational process. Its selection model captures elevated mutation rates in functionally important sites using multiple external annotations, as well as spatial clustering of mutations. Its background mutation model accounts for both known covariates and unexplained local variation. Simulations under realistic evolutionary models demonstrate that driverMAPS greatly improves the power of driver gene detection over state-of-the-art approaches. Applying driverMAPS to TCGA data across 20 tumor types identified 159 new potential driver genes. Cross-referencing this list with data from external sources strongly supports these findings. The novel genes include the mRNA methytransferases METTL3-METTL14, and we experimentally validated METTL3 as a potential tumor suppressor gene in bladder cancer. Our results thus provide strong support to the emerging hypothesis that mRNA modification is an important biological process underlying tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "We evaluate the distribution of genetic markers for antibiotic resistance in 276 genomic sequences of Extraintestinal Pathogenic E. coli from two hospitals on the U.S. West coast. Plasmid-borne genes encoding drug-inactivating enzymes dominate the distribution of aminoglycoside and {beta}-lactam resistance markers. These genes can be assigned based on their distribution to two mutually exclusive complementarity groups (CGs: CG1 and CG2) with each displaying genetic linkage and minimal functional overlap. CG1 includes genes encoding OXA-1 and AAC(6)-Ib-cr, frequently also CTX-M-15, and sometimes AAC(3)-IIe.2, a variant of AAC(3)-IIe; CG2 includes AAC(3)-IId tightly linked to TEM-1, and occasionally also to genes encoding CTX-M-14-like {beta}-lactamases. This binary distribution of aminoglycoside and {beta}-lactamase resistance genes suggests a convergence between two different evolutionary solutions, and results in a ubiquitous functional redundancy in the clinical populations. CG1 and CG2 are largely carried in IncF plasmids, of which we distinguish seven classes based on Rpt-A1 sequence homology. Both CG1 and CG2 genes are found in two different IncF plasmid classes, demonstrating their pervasive mobility across plasmid backbones. Different CG genes and IncF plasmid classes are found in a wide range of MLSTs, highlighting the prevalence of horizontal gene transfer. We also identify at least five clonally expanding MLSTs, which represent high-risk clones: ST131, ST95, ST73, ST127, and ST69. The identification of clonally-expanding types, the discovery of CGs that are ubiquitously spread in diverse clinical strains, and the functional redundancy that these two groups represent have significant implications for monitoring and controlling the spread of resistance.",

Three foveal ONL thickness measurements were made by a single observer using custom software to analyze repeatability. Interocular symmetry was assessed using the average of the three measurements for each eye.\\n\\nMain Outcome MeasuresThe main parameter being measured is foveal ONL thickness.\\n\\nResultsMean ({+/-} SD) foveal ONL thickness for ACHM patients was 74.86 {+/-} 17.82m (OD) and 75.30 {+/-} 15.68m (OS) compared to 110.60 {+/-} 15.67m (OD) and 110.53 {+/-} 13.91m (OS) for controls. Foveal ONL thickness did not differ between eyes for ACHM (p = 0.821) or control patients (p = 0.961). Intraobserver repeatability was high for foveal ONL measurements in ACHM patients (ICC = 0.939, OD and 0.915, OS) and controls (ICC = 0.991, OD and 0.984, OS).\\n\\nConclusionsFoveal ONL thickness can be measured with excellent repeatability. While foveal ONL thickness is reduced in ACHM compared to controls, the high interocular symmetry indicates that contralateral ONL measurements could be used as a negative control in early-phase monocular treatment trials.",

    "abstract": "Recent high-dimensional single-cell technologies such as mass cytometry are enabling time series experiments to monitor the temporal evolution of cell state distributions and to identify dynamically important cell states, such as fate decision states in differentiation. However, these technologies are destructive, and require analysis approaches that temporally map between cell state distributions across time points. Current approaches to approximate the single-cell time series as a dynamical system suffer from too restrictive assumptions about the type of kinetics, or link together pairs of sequential measurements in a discontinuous fashion.\\n\\nWe propose Dynamic Distribution Decomposition (DDD), an operator approximation approach to infer a continuous distribution map between time points. On the basis of single-cell snapshot time series data, DDD approximates the continuous time Perron-Frobenius operator by means of a finite set of basis functions. This procedure can be interpreted as a continuous time Markov chain over a continuum of states. By only assuming a memoryless Markov (autonomous) process, the types of dynamics represented are more general than those represented by other common models, e.g., chemical reaction networks, stochastic differential equations. Additionally, the continuity assumption ensures that the same dynamical system maps between all time points, not arbitrarily changing at each time point. We demonstrate the ability of DDD to reconstruct dynamically important cell states and their transitions both on synthetic data, as well as on mass cytometry time series of iPSC reprogramming of a fibroblast system. We use DDD to find previously identified subpopulations of cells and to visualize differentiation trajectories.\\n\\nDynamic Distribution Decomposition allows interpreting high-dimensional snapshot time series data as a low-dimensional Markov process, thereby enabling an interpretable dynamics analysis for a variety of biological processes by means of identifying their dynamically important cell states.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHigh-dimensional single-cell snapshot measurements are now increasingly utilized to study dynamic processes. Such measurements enable us to evaluate cell population distributions and their evolution over time. However, it is not trivial to map these distribution across time and to identify dynamically important cell states, i.e. bottleneck regions of state space exhibiting a high degree of change. We present Dynamic Distribution Decomposition (DDD) achieving this task by encoding single-cell measurements as linear combination of basis function distributions and evolving these as a linear system. We demonstrate reconstruction of dynamically important states for synthetic data of a bifurcated diffusion process and mass cytometry data for iPSC reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the remarkable molecular complexity of synapses has been revealed, with over 1000 proteins identified in the synapse proteome. Although it is known that different receptors and other synaptic proteins are present in different types of neurons and synapses, the extent of synapse diversity across the brain is largely unknown, mainly owing to technical limitations. Combining mouse genetics and proteomics we have previously reported highly efficient methods for purification of synaptic protein complexes under native conditions. In that approach, tandem affinity purification (TAP) tags were fused to the carboxyl terminus of PSD95 using gene targeting in mice. Here we report an approach that restricts tagging of endogenous PSD95 to cells expressing Cre recombinase. In addition, we developed a labelling strategy enabling visualization of endogenous PSD95 tagged by fluorescent proteins in Cre-expressing cells. We demonstrate the feasibility of proteomic characterisation of synapse proteomes and visualization of synapse proteins in specific cell types. We find that composition of PSD95 complexes purified from specific cell types differs from those extracted from tissues with diverse cellular composition. Therefore, these novel conditional PSD95 tagging lines will not only serve as powerful tools for precisely dissecting synapse diversity in specific subsets of regions/neuronal cells, but also provide an opportunity to better understand brain region-specific alterations associated with various psychiatric/neurological diseases. The newly developed conditional gene tagging methods can be applied to many different synaptic proteins and will thus facilitate research on the molecular complexity of synapses.",

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks drive rhythmic physiology and behavior to allow adaption to daily environmental changes. In Drosophila, the small ventral lateral neurons (sLNvs) are the master pacemakers that control circadian rhythms. Circadian changes are observed in the dorsal axonal projections of the sLNvs, but their physiological importance and the underlying mechanism are unclear. Here we identified miR-263b as an important regulator of circadian rhythms in Drosophila. Flies depleted of miR-263b (miR-263bKO) exhibited dramatically impaired rhythms under constant darkness. Indeed, miR-263b is rhythmically expressed and controls circadian output by affecting the structural plasticity of sLNvs through inhibition of expression of the LIM-only protein Beadex (Bx). The misexpression of Bx in flies phenocopied miR-263bKO in behavior and molecular characteristics. In addition, the circadian phenotypes of miR-263bKO were recapitulated by mutating the miR-263b binding sites in the Bx 3'UTR. Together, these results establish miR-263b as an important regulator of circadian locomotor behavior.",

    "abstract": "The central cholinergic system and the amygdala are important for motivation and mnemonic processes. Different cholinergic populations innervate the amygdala but it is unclear how these projections impact amygdala processes. Using optogenetic circuit-mapping strategies in ChAT-cre mice we demonstrate that amygdala-projecting basal forebrain and brainstem ChAT-containing neurons can differentially affect amygdala circuits and behavior. Photo-activating ChAT terminals in vitro revealed the underlying synaptic impact of brainstem inputs to the central lateral division to be excitatory, mediated via the synergistic glutamatergic activation of AMPA and NMDA receptors. In contrast, stimulating basal forebrain inputs to the basal nucleus resulted in endogenous ACh release resulting in biphasic inhibition-excitation responses onto principal neurons. Such response profiles are physiological hallmarks of neural oscillations and could thus form the basis of acetylcholine-mediated rhythmicity in amygdala networks. Consistent with this, in vivo NBm activation strengthened amygdala basal nucleus theta and gamma frequency rhythmicity, both of which continued for seconds after stimulation and were dependent on local muscarinic or nicotinic receptor activation, respectively. Activation of brainstem ChAT-containing neurons however resulted in a transient increase in central lateral amygdala activity that was independent of cholinergic receptors. In addition, driving these respective inputs in behaving animals induced opposing appetitive and defensive learning-related behavioral changes. Since learning and memory is supported by both cellular and network-level processes in central cholinergic and amygdala networks, these results provide a route by which distinct cholinergic inputs can convey salient information to the amygdala and promote associative biophysical changes that underlie emotional memories.",

IMP1 hypomorphic mice exhibit severe intestinal growth defects, yet its role in adult intestinal epithelium is unclear.

In parallel, we evaluated mice with intestinal epithelial-specific Imp1 deletion (Imp1{Delta}IEC) following irradiation or colitis models. Ribosome-profiling revealed translation efficiency changes for multiple pathways important for intestinal homeostasis, including autophagy, in IMP1 knockout cells. We found increased autophagy flux in Imp1{Delta}IEC mice, reinforced through in silico and biochemical analyses revealing direct binding of IMP1 to autophagy transcripts MAP1LC3B and ATG3. We found that Imp1{Delta}IEC mice exhibit enhanced recovery following irradiation, which is attenuated with genetic deletion of autophagy gene Atg7. Finally, we demonstrated that IMP1 is upregulated in Crohns disease patients and Imp1 loss lessened colitis severity in mice. These studies demonstrate that IMP1 acts as a posttranscriptional regulator of gut epithelial repair post-irradiation and colitis, in part through modulation of autophagy.",
