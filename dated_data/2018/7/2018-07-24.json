    "abstract": "Natural selection has long been hypothesised to shape ageing patterns, but whether and how ageing contributes to life-history evolution remains elusive. The complexity of various ageing-associated molecular mechanisms and their inherent stochasticity hinder reductionist approaches to the understanding of functional senescence, i.e. reduced fecundity and increased mortality. Recent bio-demographic work demonstrated that high-precision statistics of life-history traits such as mortality rates could be used phenomenologically to understand the ageing process. We adopted this approach to study cellular senescence in growth-arrested E. coli cells, where damages to functional macromolecules are no longer diluted by fast de novo biosynthesis. We acquired high-quality longitudinal physiological and life history data of large environmentally controlled clonal E. coli populations at single-cell resolution, using custom-designed microfluidic devices coupled to time-lapse microscopy. We show that E. coli lifespan distributions follow the Gompertz law of mortality, a century-old actuarial observation of human populations, despite developmental, cellular and genetic differences between bacteria and metazoan organisms. Measuring the shape of the hazard functions allowed us to disentangle quantitatively the demographic effects of ageing, which accumulate with time, from age-independent genetic longevity-modulating interventions. A pathway controlling cellular maintenance, the general stress response, not only promotes longevity but also temporally scales the whole distribution by reducing ageing rate. We further show that E. coli, constrained by the amount of total biosynthesis, adapt to their natural feast-or-famine lifestyle by modulating the amount of maintenance investment, rendering ageing rate a highly evolvable life-history trait.",

    "abstract": "The diversity in genomes is due to the accumulation of mutations and the site frequency spectrum (SFS) is a popular statistic for summarizing genomic data. The current coalescent algorithm for calculating the SFS for a given demography assumes the  [-&gt;] 0 limit, where  is the mutation probability (or rate) per base pair per generation. The algorithm is applicable when N, N being the haploid population size, is negligible. We derive a coalescent based algorithm for calculating the SFS that allows the mutation rate (t) as well as the population size N(t) to vary arbitrarily as a function of time. That algorithm shows that the probability of two mutations in the genealogy becomes noticeable already for  = 10-8 for samples of n = 105 haploid human genomes and increases rapidly with . Our algorithm calculates the SFS under the assumption of a single mutation in the genealogy, and the part of the SFS due to a single mutation depends only mildly on the finiteness of . However, the dependence of the SFS on variation in  can be substantial for even n = 100 samples. In addition, increasing and decreasing mutation rates alter the SFS in different ways and to different extents.",

Studies also suggest that REMSD are involved with muscle injury, cardiac injury and neurodegerative diseases.\\n\\nObjective and methodsThe aim of this research was to determine whether REMSD of rats would generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and create oxidative stress in the hepatocytes. We selectively deprived the rats from REM sleep using the standard flower pot method.\\n\\nResultsWe observed that when rats were subjected to REMSD, the levels of ROS in the hepatocytes increased with the increase in the number of days of REMSD by [~]265%, but it returned towards normal levels after recovery sleep for 5 days ([~]36%) compared to controls. Nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene and protein was found elevated in hepatocytes in response to REM sleep loss as confirmed by real time PCR and western blot analysis compared to controls. The level of nitric oxide (NO) also increased by [~] 675% in the hepatocytes of REMSD rats as compared to that of control group of animals.\\n\\nDiscussionWe have analyzed the oxidative stress generated and potentiation of hepatocytes against oxidative stress in response to REMSD. Since, REM sleep is known to play an important role for survival of most animals and has important role in maintenance of body physiology. Hence, our findings that loss of REM sleep in hepatocytes of rats can affect the ROS levels and induce iNOS & NO circulation, while making them more susceptible to oxidative stress assumes significance.\\n\\nHighlights of the studyO_LIWe observed elevated levels of ROS in the hepatocytes of REM sleep deprived rats.\\nC_LIO_LIThe hepatocytes of REMSD group of rats were found more susceptible to oxidative stress than that of control groups.\\nC_LIO_LIWe found increased expression of iNOS gene and nitric oxide synthase protein in the hepatocytes of REMSD rats.\\nC_LIO_LIWe observed that nitric oxide levels in the hepatocytes of REM sleep deprived rats increased positively with days of REMSD, but returned to its normal levels after 5 days of recovery sleep.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Selective use of 5' splice sites is a common mechanism by which pre-mRNAs are alternatively spliced. Whereas the sequence requirements of 5' splice site choice have been well characterized, other important determinants remain poorly defined. Here we apply a combination of structural mapping by SHAPE-MaP and targeted mutational analysis in a cell-based system to comprehensively probe the interplay of primary sequence, secondary RNA structure, regulatory elements and linear splice site position to determine mechanisms of splice site choice in vivo. Using the disease-causing alternative 5' splice site selection in LMNA in the premature aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome as a model system, we identify RNA secondary structural elements near the alternative 5' splice sites. We show that splice site choice is significantly influenced by the structural context of the available splice sites. While local structure alone is not sufficient to account for splice site selection, the choice of 5' splice sites depends on the structural stability of the 5' splice site region which is conferred by downstream elements. In addition, relative positioning of the competing sites within the primary sequence of the pre-mRNA is a predictor of 5' splice site usage, with the distal position favored over the proximal, regardless of sequence composition. Together, these results reveal an intricate interplay amongst RNA sequence, secondary structure and splice site position in determining 5' splice site choice.",

    "abstract": "Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, main vectors for numerous flaviviruses, have olfactory preferences and are capable of olfactory learning especially when seeking their required environmental conditions to lay their eggs. In this study, we showed that semiochemical conditions during Aedes aegypti larval rearing affected future female choice for oviposition: water-reared mosquitoes preferred to lay eggs in water or p-cresol containers, while skatole reared mosquitoes preferred skatole sites. Using two independent behavioural assays, we showed that this skatole preference was lost in mosquitoes infected with dengue virus. Viral RNA was extracted from infected female mosquito heads, and an increase of virus load was detected from 3 to 10 days post infection, indicating replication in the insect head and possibly in the central nervous system. Expression of selected genes, potentially implied in olfactory learning processes, were also altered during dengue infection. Based on these results, we hypothesise that dengue virus infection alters gene expression in the mosquitos head and is associated with a loss of olfactory preferences, possibly modifying oviposition site choice of female mosquitoes.",

Though axon pruning has been described in the literature for decades, relatively little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern axon pruning in vivo. Here, we show that the epigenetic reader Kismet (Kis) binds to cisregulatory elements of the steroid hormone receptor Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) gene in Drosophila neurons. Kis is required to activate EcR transcription at these elements and promote H3K36 di- and tri-methylation and H4K16 acetylation. We show that exogenous EcR can rescue axon pruning and memory defects associated with loss of Kis, and that the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA can rescue these phenotypes. EcR protein abundance is a cell-autonomous, rate-limiting step required to initiate axon pruning in Drosophila, and our data suggests that this step is under epigenetic control.\\n\\nHighlights (bullet points up to 4)O_LIThe chromodomain reader Kismet activates transcription of the steroid hormone receptor EcR-B1 in the Drosophila to initiate developmental axon pruning.\\nC_LIO_LIKismet promotes H3K36 di- and tri-methylation and H4K16 acetylation at the EcR locus and upstream cis-regulatory sites.\\nC_LIO_LIAxon pruning and memory defects associated with loss of Kismet are significantly rescued by general HDAC inhibition.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to test for the occurrence of key elements predicted by the previously postulated mammalian RNA-dependent mRNA amplification model in a tissue producing massive amounts of extracellular matrix proteins. At the core of RNA-dependent mRNA amplification, until now only described in one mammalian system, is the self-priming of an antisense strand and extension of its 3 terminus into a sense-oriented RNA containing the protein-coding information of a conventional mRNA. The resulting product constitutes a new type of biomolecule. It is chimeric in that it contains covalently connected antisense and sense sequences in a hairpin configuration. Cleavage of this chimeric intermediate in the loop region of a hairpin structure releases mRNA which contains an antisense segment in its 5UTR; depending on the position of self-priming, the chimeric end product may encode the entire protein or its C-terminal fragment. The occurrence of such composite chimeric molecules is unique for this type of mRNA amplification and represents a conclusive \\\"identifier\\\" of this process. We report here the detection, by next generation sequencing, of such chimeric junction sequences for mRNAs molecules encoding l, {beta}1, and {gamma}1 chains of laminin in cells of the extracellular matrix-generating Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) mouse tumor, best known for producing extraordinarily large amounts of \\\"Matrigel\\\".",

Triple combination of siRNAs targeting on Sparc, Ccr2 and Smad3 achieved favorable anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. Inhibition of inflammation was evidenced by reduced inflammatory cells and proinflammatory cytokines in the BALF and/or the tissues. Activation of fibroblasts was suppressed in mouse tissues in which -Sma and collagens were significantly reduced. Aberrant expression of the genes in fibroblasts, monocytes/macrophage, endothelial and epithelial cells were reinstalled after the treatment. In addition, transcriptome profiles indicated that some bleomycin-induced alterations of multiple biological pathways were recovered to varying degrees by the treatment. The results indicated that the triple combination of siRNAs systemically reinstated multiple biopathways, probably through controlling on different cell types including fibroblasts, monocytes/macrophages, endothelial cells and others.

    "abstract": "Much of euchromatin regulation occurs through reversible methylation of histone H3 lysine-4 and lysine-36 (H3K4me and H3K36me). Using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we previously found that levels of H3K4me modulated temperature sensitive alleles of the transcriptional elongation complex Spt6-Spn1 through an unknown H3K4me effector pathway. Here we identify the Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex as the H3K4me effector underlying these Spt6-Spn1 genetic interactions. Exploiting these Spt6-Spn1 genetic interactions, we show that H3K4me and H3K36me collaboratively impact Rpd3S function in an opposing manner. H3K36me is deposited by the histone methyltransferase Set2 and is known to promote Rpd3S function at RNA PolII transcribed open reading frames. Using genetic epistasis experiments, we find that mutations perturbing the Set2-H3K36me-Rpd3S pathway suppress the growth defects caused by temperature sensitive alleles of SPT6 and SPN1, illuminating that this pathway antagonizes Spt6-Spn1. Using these sensitive genetic assays, we also identify a role for H3K4me in antagonizing Rpd3S that functions through the Rpd3S subunit Rco1, which is known to bind H3 N-terminal tails in a manner that is prevented by H3K4me. Further genetic experiments reveal that the H3K4 and H3K36 demethylases JHD2 and RPH1 mediate this combinatorial control of Rpd3S. Finally, our studies also show that the Rpd3L complex, which acts at promoter-proximal regions of PolII transcribed genes, counters Rpd3S for genetic modulation of Spt6-Spn1, and that these two Rpd3 complexes balance the activities of each other. Our findings present the first evidence that H3K4me and H3K36me act combinatorially to control Rpd3S.",

    "abstract": "Clinical interpretation of exome and genome sequencing data remains challenging and time consuming, with many variants with unknown effects found in genes with unknown functions. Automated prioritization of these variants can improve the speed of current diagnostics and identify previously unknown disease genes. Here, we used 31,499 RNA-seq samples to predict the phenotypic consequences of variants in genes. We developed GeneNetwork Assisted Diagnostic Optimization (GADO), a tool that uses these predictions in combination with a patients phenotype, denoted using HPO terms, to prioritize identified variants and ease interpretation. GADO is unique because it does not rely on existing knowledge of a gene and can therefore prioritize variants missed by tools that rely on existing annotations or pathway membership. In a validation trial on patients with a known genetic diagnosis, GADO prioritized the causative gene within the top 3 for 41% of the cases. Applying GADO to a cohort of 38 patients without genetic diagnosis, yielded new candidate genes for seven cases. Our results highlight the added value of GADO (www.genenetwork.nl) for increasing diagnostic yield and for implicating previously unknown disease-causing genes.",

    "abstract": "High quality genomes are essential to resolve challenges in breeding, comparative biology, medicine and conservation planning. New library preparation techniques along with better assembly algorithms result in continued improvements in assemblies for non-model organisms, moving them toward reference quality genomes. We report on the latest genome assembly of the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin leveraging Illumina sequencing data coupled with a combination of several library preparation techniques. These include Linked-Reads (Chromium, 10x Genomics), mate pairs, long insert paired ends and standard paired ends. Data were assembled with the commercial DeNovoMAGICTM assembly software resulting in two assemblies, a traditional \\\"haploid\\\" assembly (Tur_tru_Illumina_hap_v1) that is a mosaic of the two parental haplotypes and a phased assembly (Tur_tru_Illumina_phased_v1) where each scaffold has sequence from a single homologous chromosome. We show that Tur_tru_Illumina_hap_v1 is more complete and accurate compared to the current best reference based on the amount and composition of sequence, the consistency of the mate pair alignments to the assembled scaffolds, and on the analysis of conserved single-copy mammalian orthologs. The phased de novo assembly Tur_tru_Illumina_phased_v1 is the first publicly available for this species and provides the community with novel and accurate ways to explore the heterozygous nature of the dolphin genome.",

    "abstract": "Promoter-proximal pausing and divergent transcription at promoters and enhancers, which are prominent features in animals, have been reported to be absent in plants based on a study of Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, our PRO-Seq analysis in cassava (Manihot esculenta) identified peaks of transcriptionally-engaged RNA polymerase II (Pol2) at both 5 and 3 ends of genes, consistent with paused or slowly-moving Pol2, and divergent transcription at potential intragenic enhancers. A full genome search for bi-directional transcription using an algorithm for enhancer detection developed in mammals (dREG) identified many enhancer candidates. These sites show distinct patterns of methylation and nucleotide variation based on genomic evolutionary rate profiling characteristic of active enhancers. Maize GRO-Seq data showed RNA polymerase occupancy at promoters and enhancers consistent with cassava but not Arabidopsis. Furthermore, putative enhancers in maize identified by dREG significantly overlapped with sites previously identified on the basis of open chromatin, histone marks, and methylation. We show that SNPs within these divergently transcribed intergenic regions predict significantly more variation in fitness and root composition than SNPs in chromosomal segments randomly ascertained from the same intergenic distribution, suggesting a functional importance of these sites on cassava. The findings shed new light on plant transcription regulation and its impact on development and plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Attention selects relevant information regardless of whether it is physically present or internally stored in working memory. Perceptual research has shown that attentional selection of external information is better conceived as rhythmic prioritization than as stable allocation. Here we tested this principle using information processing of internal representations held in working memory. Participants memorized four spatial positions that formed the endpoints of two objects. One of the positions was cued for a delayed match-non-match test. When uncued positions were probed, participants responded faster to uncued positions located on the same object as the cued position than to those located on the other object, revealing object-based attention in working memory. Manipulating the interval between cue and probe at a high temporal resolution revealed that reaction times oscillated at a theta rhythm of 6 Hz. Moreover, oscillations showed an anti-phase relationship between memorized but uncued positions on the same versus other object as the cued position, suggesting that attentional prioritization fluctuated rhythmically in an object-based manner. Our results demonstrate the highly rhythmic nature of attentional selection in working memory. Moreover, the striking similarity between rhythmic attentional selection of mental representations and perceptual information suggests that attentional oscillations are a general mechanism of information processing in human cognition. These findings have important implications for current, attention-based models of working memory.",

Previous work has demonstrated that eDNA metabarcoding provides reliable information for lake fish monitoring, but important questions remain about temporal and spatial repeatability, which is critical for understanding the ecology of eDNA and developing effective sampling strategies. Here, we carried out comprehensive spatial sampling of Englands largest lake, Windermere, during summer and winter to 1) examine repeatability of the method, 2) compare eDNA results with contemporary gill-net survey data, 3) test the hypothesis of greater spatial structure of eDNA in summer compared to winter due to differences in water mixing between seasons, and 4) compare the effectiveness of shore and offshore sampling for species detection. We find broad consistency between results from three sampling events in terms of species detection and abundance, with eDNA detecting more species than established methods and being significantly correlated to rank abundance determined by long-term data. As predicted, spatial structure was much greater in the summer, reflecting less mixing of eDNA than in the winter. For example Arctic charr, a deep-water species, was only detected in deep, mid-lake samples in the summer, while littoral or benthic species such as minnow and stickleback were more frequently detected in shore samples. By contrast in winter, the eDNA of these species was more uniformly distributed. This has important implications for design of sampling campaigns, for example, deep-water species could be missed and littoral/benthic species overrepresented by focusing exclusively on shoreline samples collected in the summer.",

An extra copy or gain-of-function mutations in APP lower age of AD onset. Compared to the other isoforms (APOE3 and APOE2), the {varepsilon}4 allele of APOE (APOE4) hastens and exacerbates early and late onset forms of AD. Convenient in vivo models to study how APP and APOE4 interact at the cellular and molecular level to influence neurodegeneration are lacking. Here, we show that the nematode C. elegans can model important aspects of AD including age-related, patterned neurodegeneration that is exacerbated by APOE4. Specifically, we found that APOE4, but not APOE3, acts with APP to hasten and expand the pattern of cholinergic neurodegeneration caused by APP. Molecular mechanisms underlying how APP and APOE4 synergize to kill some neurons while leaving others unaffected may be uncovered using this convenient worm model of neurodegeneration.",

We arranged a conditioned stimulus (CS) to either precede or follow an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), a procedure that established reliable (forward) or ambiguous (backward) signals for US onset. After conditioning, reversible inactivation of the BNST selectively reduced freezing to the backward CS; BNST inactivation did not affect freezing to the forward CS even when that CS predicted a variable magnitude US. Backward CSs increased Fos in the ventral BNST and in BNST-projecting neurons in the infralimbic cortex, but not the hippocampus or amygdala. These data reveal that BNST circuits process ambiguous threat signals central to the etiology and expression of anxiety.",

The V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and deep-sequenced. Alpha diversity metrics; Chao1, PD whole tree, and operational taxonomic Unit (OTU) estimates, displayed significantly higher bacterial richness in HIV positive patients (P = 0.01) than in HIV negative patients. Within HIV positive patients, there was higher bacterial richness in patients with high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL; P = 0.13) than those without lesions. The most abundant OTUs associated with high-grade squamous intraepitheilal lesions (HSIL) were Mycoplasmatales, Pseudomonadales, and Staphylococcus.

    "abstract": "UV-B regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in vegetative and grapevine berry tissues has been extensively described. However, its relation with UV-B-regulated microRNAs (miRNAs) has not been addressed before in this species. We explored by deep sequencing of small RNA libraries the developmental dynamics and UV-B effects on miRNAs and associated phased small interfering RNA (phasi-RNAs)-producing loci abundances in in vitro-grown plantlets, in field-grown berry skins of cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, and low- and high UV-B fluence treatments of greenhouse-grown berries at several time points around veraison. We observed by RNA blotting a differential effect of low-versus high-fluence UV-B on miR828 abundances (an effector of anthocyanins and UV-absorbing polyphenolics) across berry development, and identified other miRNAs that correlated with miR828 dynamics. The functional significance of the observed UV-coordinated miRNA responses to UV was supported by degradome evidences of AGO-programmed slicing of mRNAs. Inverse co-expression of the up-regulated miRNAs miR156, miR482, miR530, and miR828 with cognate target gene expressions in response to high fluence UV-B measured by quantitative real-time PCR. These UV-response relationships were also corroborated by analyzing three published transcriptome datasets (berries subjected to UV-C for 1 hr [at pre-veraison], UV-B for five weeks post-veraison, and five red-skinned varieties across four berry development time points). Based on observed significant changes by UV-B on miRNA and derivative phasi-RNA abundances, we propose a regulatory network model of UV responses impacting anti-oxidant and stress-associated polyphenolic compound biosynthesis. In this model high-fluence UV-B increases miR168 (validated in a UV-B small RNA-derived degradome library to target ARGONAUTE1, which spawns phasi-RNAs) and miR530 (targets a novel Plus-3 domain mRNA), while decreasing miR403 abundances (validated to target ARGONAUTE2), thereby coordinating post-transcriptional gene silencing activities by different AGOs. Up-regulation of miR3627/4376 (validated to target Ca2+-transporting ATPase10 that spawns phasi-RNAs) could facilitate anthocyanin accumulation. miR395 and miR399, induced by sulfur and phosphorus starvation in other species (conditions known to trigger anthocyanin accumulation) respond positively to UV-B radiation and are shown to slice cognate targets in grapevine. miR156/miR535 is shown to target SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING transcription factor genes that potentially regulate the activities of MYB-bHLH-WD40 complexes and thereby anthocyanin biosynthesis. Increases in MYB-bHLH-WD40 TFs could also contribute to the observed up-regulation of miR828 via the conserved and degradome-validated auto-regulatory loop involving miR828/TAS4abc to regulate MYBA6/A7/A5-MYB113-like levels and thereby anthocyanin levels. These results and meta-analysis provide a basis for systems approaches to better understand non-coding RNA functions in response to UV.",

The change of cholesterol molar ratio from 0% to 33% also decreases the permeability of the membrane by approximately one order of magnitude.

The application of these two collapsing methods to 3,093 ALS cases and 8,186 controls of European ancestry, and also 3,239 cases and 11,808 controls of diversified populations, pinpoints risk regions of ALS genes including SOD1, NEK1, TARDBP and FUS.

    "abstract": "DNA damage signaling is critical for the maintenance of genome integrity and cell fate decision. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is a DNA damage sensor rapidly activated in a damage dose and complexity-dependent manner playing a critical role in the initial chromatin organization and DNA repair pathway choice at damage sites. However, the cell-wide consequence of its activation in damaged cells is not well delineated. Using the phasor approach to fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and fluorescence-based biosensors in combination with laser microirradiation, we found a rapid cell-wide increase of the bound/free NADH ratio in response to nuclear DNA damage, which is triggered by NAD+ depletion by PARP activation. This change is linked to the metabolic balance shift to oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) over glycolysis. Inhibition of the respiratory chain resulted in rapid PARP-dependent ATP reduction and intracellular acidification, and eventually, PARP-dependent, AIF-independent, apoptosis indicating that oxphos becomes critical for damaged cell survival. The results reveal the novel pro-survival effect of PARP activation through a change in cellular metabolism, and demonstrate how unique applications of advanced fluorescence imaging technologies in combination with laser microirradiation can be a powerful tool to interrogate damage-induced metabolic changes at high spatiotemporal resolution in a live cell.",

The absence of some fungal enzymes necessary for cathinone and psilocybin biosynthesis along with the inability to detect intermediate metabolites or gene orthologs are consistent with possibly novel biosynthesis pathways in Massospora. The neurogenic activities of these compounds suggest the extended phenotype of Massospora that modifies cicada behavior to maximize dissemination is chemically-induced.",

    "abstract": "Plant mitochondrial genomes have excessive size relative to coding capacity, a low mutation rate in genes and a high rearrangement rate. They also have non-tandem repeats in two size groups: a few large repeats which cause isomerization of the genome by recombination, and numerous repeats longer than 50bp, often found in exactly two copies per genome. It appears that repeats in the size range from several hundred to a few thousand base pair are underrepresented. The repeats are not well-conserved between species, and are infrequently annotated in mitochondrial sequence assemblies. Because they are much larger than expected by chance we call them Repeats Of Unusual Size (ROUS). The repeats consist of two functional classes, those that are involved in genome isomerization through frequent crossing over, and those for which crossovers are rare unless there are mutations in DNA repair genes, or the rate of double-strand breakage is increased. We systematically described and compared these repeats, which are important clues to mechanisms of DNA maintenance in mitochondria. We developed a tool to find non-tandem repeats and analyzed the complete mitochondrial sequences from 135 plant species. We observed an interesting difference between taxa: the repeats are larger and more frequent in the vascular plants. Analysis of closely related species also shows that plant mitochondrial genomes evolve in dramatic bursts of breakage and rejoining, complete with DNA sequence gain and loss, and the repeats are included in these events. We suggest an adaptive explanation for the existence of the repeats and their evolution.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variant landscape of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is dominated by non-coding variants among which many occur within putative enhancers regulating the expression levels of relevant genes. It is crucial to assign the genetic variants to their correct gene both to gain insights into perturbed functions and better assess the risk of disease. In this study, we generated high-resolution genomic interaction maps (~750 bases) in aortic endothelial, smooth muscle and THP-1 macrophages using Hi-C coupled with sequence capture targeting 25,429 features including variants associated with CVD. We detected interactions for 761 CVD risk variants obtained by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and identified novel as well as established functions associated with CVD. We were able to fine-map 331 GWAS variants using interaction networks, thereby identifying additional genes and functions. We also discovered a subset of risk variants interacting with multiple promoters and the expression levels of such genes were correlated. The presented resource enables functional studies of cardiovascular disease providing novel approaches for its diagnosis and treatment.",

    "abstract": "We recently discovered that inhibition of the lipid peroxidase GPX4 can selectively kill cancer cells in a therapy-resistant state through induction of ferroptosis. Although GPX4 lacks a conventional druggable pocket, covalent small-molecule inhibitors are able to overcome this challenge by reacting with the GPX4 catalytic selenocysteine residue to eliminate enzymatic activity. Unfortunately, all currently-reported GPX4 inhibitors achieve their activity through reactive chloroacetamide groups. We demonstrate that such chloroacetamide-containing compounds are poor starting points for further advancement given their promiscuity, instability, and low bioavailability. Development of improved GPX4 inhibitors, including those with therapeutic potential, requires the identification of new electrophilic chemotypes and mechanisms of action that do not suffer these shortcomings. Here, we report our discovery that nitrile oxide electrophiles, and a set of remarkable chemical transformations that generates them in cells from masked precursors, provide an effective strategy for selective targeting of GPX4. Our results, which include structural insights, target engagement assays, and diverse GPX4-inhibitor tool compounds, provide critical insights that may galvanize development of improved compounds that illuminate the basic biology of GPX4 and therapeutic potential of ferroptosis induction. In addition, our discovery that nitrile oxide electrophiles engage in highly selective cellular interactions and are bioavailable in their masked forms may be relevant for targeting other currently undruggable proteins, such as those revealed by recent proteome-wide ligandability studies.",
