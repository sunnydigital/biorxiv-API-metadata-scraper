    "abstract": "The long-running debate about the role of selection in maintaining genetic variation has been given new impetus by the discovery of hundreds of seasonally oscillating polymorphisms in wild Drosophila, possibly stabilized by an alternating summer-winter selection regime. Historically there has been skepticism about the potential of temporal variation to balance polymorphism, because selection must be strong to have a meaningful stabilizing effect -- unless dominance also varies over time (\"reversal of dominance\"). Here we develop a simplified model of seasonally variable selection that simultaneously incorporates four different stabilizing mechanisms, including two genetic mechanisms (\"cumulative overdominance\" and reversal of dominance), as well as ecological \"storage\" (\"protection from selection\" and boom-bust demography). We use our model to compare the stabilizing effects of these mechanisms. Although reversal of dominance has by far the greatest stabilizing effect, we argue that the three other mechanisms could also stabilize polymorphism under plausible conditions, particularly when all three are present. With many loci subject to diminishing returns epistasis, reversal of dominance stabilizes many alleles of small effect. This makes the combination of the other three mechanisms, which are incapable of stabilizing small effect alleles, a better candidate for stabilizing the detectable frequency oscillations of large effect alleles.",

    "abstract": "Self-fertilization is often associated with ecological traits corresponding to the ruderal strategy in Grimes Competitive-Stress-tolerant-Ruderal (CSR) classification of ecological strategies. Consequently, selfers are expected to be less competitive than outcrossers, either because of a colonization/competition trade-off or because of the deleterious genetic effects of selfing. Range expansion could reduce further competitive ability while polyploidy could mitigate the effects of selfing. Although suggested by meta-analyses, these predictions have not been directly tested yet. We compared the competitive ability of four Capsella species differing by their mating system and ploidy level. We found that the two diploid selfing species (C. rubella and C. orientalis) were more sensitive to competition than the diploid outcrosser (C. grandiflora), and that the tetraploid selfer (C. bursa-pastoris) was intermediate. Within C. bursa-pastoris, we also found that sensitivity to competition increased in parallel to range expansion. These results highlight the possible roles of ecological context and ploidy in the evolutionary trajectories of selfing species.",

    "abstract": "Fast synaptic inhibition in the nervous system depends on the transmembrane flux of Cl- ions based on the neuronal Cl- driving force. Established theories regarding the determinants of Cl- driving force have recently been questioned. Here we present biophysical models of Cl- homeostasis using the pump-leak model. Using numerical and novel analytic solutions, we demonstrate that the Na+/K+-ATPase, ion conductances, impermeant anions, electrodiffusion, water fluxes and cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) play roles in setting the Cl- driving force. Our models, together with experimental validation, show that while impermeant anions can contribute to setting [Cl-]i in neurons, they have a negligible effect on the driving force for Cl- locally and cell-wide. In contrast, we demonstrate that CCCs are well-suited for modulating Cl- driving force and hence inhibitory signalling in neurons. Our findings reconcile recent experimental findings and provide a framework for understanding the interplay of different chloride regulatory processes in neurons.",

Second, we undertook a pilot study using Illumina next generation sequencing (NGS) to determine the frequency of HHV-6 in CSF and respiratory samples that were initially submitted to the laboratory for other diagnostic tests.\\n\\nResultsOf 72 samples tested for HHV-6 by PCR at the request of a clinician, 24 (33%) were positive for HHV-6. The majority of these patients were under the care of the haematology team (30/41, 73%), and there was a borderline association between HHV-6 detection and both Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) and Central nervous system (CNS) disease (p=0.05 in each case). We confirmed detection of HHV-6 DNA using NGS in 4/20 (20%) CSF and respiratory samples.\\n\\nConclusionsHHV-6 is common in clinical samples submitted from a high-risk haematology population, and enhanced screening of this group should be considered. NGS can be used to identify HHV-6 from a complex microbiomee, but further controls are required to define the sensitivity and specificity, and to correlate these results with clinical disease. Our results underpin ongoing efforts to develop NGS technology for viral diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "The attentional sampling hypothesis suggests that attention rhythmically enhances sensory processing when attending to a single (~8 Hz), or multiple (~4 Hz) objects. Here we investigated using binocular rivalry whether attention samples sensory representations that are not part of the conscious percept, during competition for perceptual dominance. When crossmodally cued toward a conscious image, subsequent changes in consciousness occurred at ~8 Hz, consistent with rates of undivided attentional sampling. However, when attention was cued toward the suppressed image, changes in consciousness slowed to ~3.5 Hz, indicating the division of attention away from the conscious visual image. In the electroencephalogram, we found that at 3.5 and 8 Hz, the strength of inter-trial phase coherence over fronto-temporal and parieto-occipital regions correlated with behavioral measures of changes in perception. When cues were not task-relevant, these effects disappeared, confirming that perceptual changes were dependent upon the allocation of attention, and that attention can flexibly sample away from a conscious image in a task-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA-to-I RNA editing is a co-/post-transcriptional modification catalyzed by ADAR enzymes, that deaminates Adenosines (A) into Inosines (I). Most of known editing events are located within inverted ALU repeats, but they also occur in coding sequences and may alter the function of encoded proteins. RNA editing contributes to generate transcriptomic diversity and it is found altered in cancer, autoimmune and neurological disorders. Emerging evidences indicate that editing process could be influenced by genetic variations, biological and environmental variables.\\n\\nResultsWe analyzed RNA editing levels in human blood using RNA-seq data from 459 healthy individuals and identified 2,079 sites consistently edited in this tissue. As expected, analysis of gene expression revealed that ADAR is the major contributor to editing on these sites, explaining [~]13% of observed variability. After removing ADAR effect, we found significant associations for 1,122 genes, mainly involved in RNA processing. These genes were significantly enriched in genes encoding proteins interacting with ADARs, including 276 potential ADARs interactors and 9 ADARs direct partners. In addition, our analysis revealed several factors potentially influencing RNA editing in blood, including cell composition, age, Body Mass Index, smoke and alcohol consumption. Finally, we identified genetic loci associated with editing levels, including known ADAR eQTLs and a small region on chromosome 7, containing LOC730338, a lincRNA gene that appears to modulate ADARs mRNA expression.\\n\\nConclusionsOur data provides a detailed picture of the most relevant RNA editing events and their variability in human blood, giving interesting insights on potential mechanisms behind this post-transcriptional modification and its regulation in this tissue.",

    "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly clear that many proteins start to fold cotranslationally, before the entire polypeptide chain has been synthesized on the ribosome. One class of proteins that a priori would seem particularly prone to cotranslational folding is repeat proteins, i.e., proteins that are built from an array of nearly identical sequence repeats. However, while the folding of repeat proteins has been studied extensively in vitro with purified proteins, only a handful of studies have addressed the issue of cotranslational folding of repeat proteins. Here, we have determined the structure and studied the cotranslational folding of a {beta}-helix pentarepeat protein from the human pathogen Clostridium botulinum - a homolog of the Fluoroquinolone Resistance Protein MfpA - using an assay in which the SecM translational arrest peptide serves as a force sensor to detect folding events. We find that cotranslational folding of a segment corresponding to the first four of the eight {beta}-helix coils in the protein produces enough force to release ribosome stalling, and that folding starts when this unit is ~35 residues away from the P-site, near the distal end of the ribosome exit tunnel. An additional folding transition is seen when the whole PENT moiety emerges from the exit tunnel. The early cotranslational formation of a folded unit may be important to avoid misfolding events in vivo, and may reflect the minimal size of a stable {beta}-helix since it is structurally homologous to the smallest known {beta}-helix protein, a four-coil protein that is stable in solution.",

    "abstract": "In speech, linguistic information is conveyed redundantly by many simultaneously present acoustic dimensions, such as fundamental frequency, duration and amplitude. Listeners show stable tendencies to prioritize these acoustic dimensions differently, relative to one another, which suggests individualized speech perception  strategies. However, it is unclear what drives these strategies, and more importantly, what impact they have on diverse aspects of communication. Here we show that such individualized perceptual strategies can be related to individual differences in perceptual ability. In a cue weighting experiment, we first demonstrate that individuals with a severe pitch perception deficit (congenital amusics) categorize linguistic stimuli similarly to controls when their deficit is unrelated to the main distinguishing cue for that category (in this case, durational or temporal cues). In contrast, in a prosodic task where pitch-related cues are typically more informative, amusics place less importance on this pitch-related information when categorizing speech. Instead, they relied more on duration information. Crucially, these differences in perceptual weights were observed even when pitch-related differences were large enough to be perceptually distinct to amusic listeners. In a second set of experiments involving musical and prosodic phrase interpretation, we found that this reliance on duration information allowed amusics to overcome their perceptual deficits and perceive both speech and music successfully. These results suggest that successful speech - and potentially music - comprehension is achieved through multiple perceptual strategies whose underlying weights may in part reflect individuals perceptual abilities.",

We found that cardiovascular health and age made approximately similar contributions to white matter health and explained up to 56% of variance. Lower diastolic blood pressure, higher systolic blood pressure and higher heart rate were each strongly, and independently, associated with white matter abnormalities on all indices. Body mass and exercise were associated with white matter health, both directly and indirectly via cardiovascular health. These results highlight the importance of cardiovascular risk factors for white matter health across the adult lifespan and suggest that systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate affect white matter via separate mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Spines, or modified hairs, have evolved multiple times in mammals, particularly in rodents. In this study, we investigated the evolution of spines in six rodent families. We first measured and compared the morphology and physical properties of hairs between paired spiny and non-spiny sister lineages. We found two distinct hair morphologies had repeatedly evolved in spiny rodents: hairs with a grooved cross-section and a second near cylindrical form. Compared to the ancestral elliptical-shaped hairs, spiny hairs had higher tension and stiffness, and overall, hairs with similar morphology had similar functional properties. To examine the genetic basis of this convergent evolution, we tested whether a single amino acid change (V370A) in the Ecdysoplasin A receptor (Edar) gene is associated with spiny hair, as this substitution causes thicker and straighter hair in East Asian human populations. We found that most mammals have the common amino acid valine at position 370, but two species, the kangaroo rat (non-spiny) and spiny pocket mouse (spiny), have an isoleucine. Importantly, none of the variants we identified are associated with differences in rodent hair morphology. Thus, the specific Edar mutation associated with variation in human hair does not seem to play a role in modifying hairs in wild rodents, suggesting that different mutations in Edar and/or other genes are responsible for variation in the spiny hair phenotypes we observed within rodents.",

    "abstract": "Genomic selection - the prediction of breeding values using DNA polymorphisms - is a disruptive method that has widely been adopted by animal and plant breeders to increase productivity. It was recently shown that other sources of molecular variations such as those resulting from transcripts or metabolites could be used to accurately predict complex traits. These endophenotypes have the advantage of capturing the expressed genotypes and consequently the complex regulatory networks that occur in the different layers between the genome and the phenotype. However, obtaining such omics data at very large scales, such as those typically experienced in breeding, remains challenging. As an alternative, we proposed using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a high-throughput, low cost and non-destructive tool to indirectly capture endophenotypic variants and compute relationship matrices for predicting complex traits and coined this new approach \\\"phenomic selection\\\" (PS). We tested PS on two species of economic interest (Triticum aestivum L. and Populus nigra L.) using NIRS on various tissues (grains, leaves, wood). We showed that one could reach predictions as accurate as with molecular markers, for developmental, tolerance and productivity traits, even in environments radically different from the one in which NIRS were collected. Our work constitutes a proof of concept and provides new perspectives for the breeding community, as PS is theoretically applicable to any organism at low cost and does not require any molecular information.\\n\\nARTICLE SUMMARYDespite its widely adopted interest in breeding, genomic selection - the prediction of breeding values using DNA polymorphisms - remains difficult to implement for many species because of genotyping costs. As an alternative or complement depending on the context, we propose \\\"phenomic selection\\\" (PS) as the use of low-cost and high-throughput phenotypic records to reconstruct similarities between genotypes and predict their performances. As a proof of concept of PS, we made use of near infrared spectroscopy applied to different tissues in poplar and wheat to predict various key traits and showed that PS could reach predictions as accurate as with molecular markers.",

    "abstract": "NADHX and NADPHX are hydrated and redox inactive forms of the NADH and NADPH cofactors, known to inhibit several dehydrogenases in vitro. A metabolite repair system that is conserved in all domains of life and that comprises the two enzymes NAD(P)HX dehydratase and NAD(P)HX epimerase, allows reconversion of both the S- and R-epimers of NADHX and NADPHX to the normal cofactors. An inherited deficiency in this system has recently been shown to cause severe neurometabolic disease in children. Although evidence for the presence of NAD(P)HX has been obtained in plant and human cells, little is known about the mechanism of formation of these derivatives in vivo and their potential effects on cell metabolism. Here, we show that NAD(P)HX dehydratase deficiency in yeast leads to an important, temperature-dependent NADHX accumulation in quiescent cells with a concomitant depletion of intracellular NAD+ and serine pools. We demonstrate that NADHX potently inhibits the first step of the serine synthesis pathway in yeast. Human cells deficient in the NAD(P)HX dehydratase also accumulated NADHX and showed decreased viability. In addition, those cells consumed more glucose and produced more lactate, potentially indicating impaired mitochondrial function. Our results provide first insights into how NADHX accumulation affects cellular functions and pave the way for a better understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying the rapid and severe neurodegeneration leading to early death in NADHX repair deficient children.",

This study is the first to explore the relationship between discrimination and DNA methylation of stress regulatory genes in Latinas. Our sample was Latina women (n = 147) with a mean age of 27.6 years who were assessed at 24-32 weeks gestation (T1) and 4-6 weeks postpartum (T2) and reside in the U.S. Blood was collected at T1, and the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) was administered at T1 and T2. DNA Methylation at candidate gene regions was determined by bisulphite pyrosequencing. Associations between EDS and DNA methylation were assessed via zero-inflated Poisson models, adjusting for covariates and multiple-test comparisons. Discrimination was negatively associated with methylation at CpG sites within the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genes that were consistent over time. In addition, discrimination was negatively associated with methylation of a CpG in the glucocorticoid binding protein (FKBP5) at T1 but not at T2. This study underscores the complex biological pathways between discrimination and epigenetic modification in Latina women that warrant further investigation to better understand the genetic and psychopathological impact of discrimination on Latino mothers and their families.",

    "abstract": "The human retina is typically imaged in a reflection geometry, where light is delivered through the pupil and images are formed from the light reflected back from the retina. In this configuration, artifacts caused by retinal surface reflex are often encountered, which complicate quantitative interpretation of the reflection images. We present an alternative illumination method, which avoids these artifacts. The method uses deeply penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light delivered transcranially from the side of the head, and exploits multiple scattering to redirect a portion of the light towards the posterior eye. This unique transmission geometry simplifies absorption measurements and enables flash-free, non-mydriatic imaging as deep as the choroid. Images taken with this new transillumination approach are applied to retinal oximetry.\\n\\nOCIS codes: (170.4460) Ophthalmic optics and devices; (170.2945) Illumination design; (170.1470) Blood or tissue constituent monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) bind DNA through an array of tandem 34-residue repeats. Here, we examine the kinetics of DNA binding for a set of TALE arrays with varying numbers of identical repeats using single molecule microscopy. Using a new deterministic modeling approach, we find evidence for conformational heterogeneity in both the free- and DNA-bound TALE arrays. Combined with previous work demonstrating populations of partly folded TALE states, our findings reveal a functional instability in TALE-DNA binding. For TALEs forming less than one superhelical turn around DNA, partly folded open states inhibit DNA binding. In contrast, for TALEs forming more than one turn, the partly folded open states facilitate DNA binding. Overall, we find that increasing repeat number results in significantly slower interconversion between the various DNA-free and DNA-bound states. These findings highlight the role of conformational heterogeneity and dynamics in facilitating macromolecular complex assembly.\\n\\nImpact StatementSingle molecule DNA-binding trajectories and deterministic modeling analyses demonstrate a functional role for high energy partly folded states in Transcription Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs) that could improve future TALEN design.",

    "abstract": "The t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) method is one of the leading techniques for data visualization and clustering. This method finds lower dimensional embeddings of data points while minimizing distortions in distances between neighboring data points. By construction, t-SNE discards information about large scale structure of the data. We show that adding a global cost function to the t-SNE cost function makes it possible to cluster the data while preserving global inter-cluster data structure. We test the new \\\"global t-SNE\\\" (g-SNE) method on one synthetic and two real data sets on flowers and human brain cells which have significant and meaningful global structures. In all cases, g-SNE outperforms t-SNE in preserving the global structure. The weight parameter {lambda} of the global cost function determines the balance between local and global distances preservations. For the human brain atlas data set, we show the tradeoff of {lambda} in representing global structure of data. Using g-SNE with the optimized {lambda} may therefore yield biological insights into how data is organized on multiple scales. The MATLAB code is available at: https://github.com/gyrheart/gsne",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt is estimated by the American Cancer Society that approximately 5% of all metastatic tumors have no defined primary site (tissue) of origin and are classified as cancers of unknown primary (CUPs). The current standard of care for CUP patients depends on immunohistochemistry (IHC) based approaches to identify the primary site. The addition of post-mortem evaluation to IHC based tests helps to reveal the identity of the primary site for only 25% of the CUPs, emphasizing the acute need for better methods of determination of the site of origin. CUP patients are therefore given generic chemotherapeutic agents resulting in poor prognosis. When the tissue of origin is known, patients can be given site specific therapy with significant improvement in clinical outcome. Similarly, identifying the primary site of origin of metastatic cancer is of great importance for designing treatment.\\n\\nIdentification of the primary site of origin is an import first step but may not be sufficient information for optimal treatment of the patient. Recent studies, primarily from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, and others, have revealed molecular subtypes in several cancer types with distinct clinical outcome. The molecular subtype captures the fundamental mechanisms driving the cancer and provides information that is essential for the optimal treatment of a cancer. Thus, along with primary site of origin, molecular subtype of a tumor is emerging as a criterion for personalized medicine and patient entry into clinical trials.\\n\\nHowever, there is no comprehensive toolset available for precise identification of tissue of origin or molecular subtype for precision medicine and translational research.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsWe posited that metastatic tumors will harbor the gene expression profiles of the primary site of origin of the cancer. Therefore, we decided to learn the molecular characteristics of the primary tumors using the large number of cancer genome profiles available from the TCGA project. Our predictors were trained for 33 cancer types and for the 11 cancers where there are established molecular subtypes. We estimated the accuracy of several machine learning models using cross-validation methods. The extensive testing using independent test sets revealed that the predictors had a median sensitivity and specificity of 97.2% and 99.9% respectively without losing classification of any tumor. Subtype classifiers achieved median sensitivity of 87.7% and specificity of 94.5% via cross validation and presented median sensitivity of 79.6% and specificity of 94.6% in two external datasets of 1,999 total samples. Importantly, these external data shows that our classifiers can robustly predict the primary site of origin from external microarray data, metastatic cancer data, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) data.\\n\\nConclusionWe have demonstrated the utility of gene expression profiles to solve the important clinical challenge of identifying the primary site of origin and the molecular subtype of cancers based on machine learning algorithms. We show, for the first time to our knowledge, that our pan-cancer classifiers can predict multiple cancers primary site of origin from metastatic samples. The predictors will be made available as open source software, freely available for academic non-commercial use.",

    "abstract": "Orthogonal confirmation of NGS-detected germline variants has been standard practice, although published studies have suggested that confirmation of the highest quality calls may not always be necessary. The key question is how laboratories can establish criteria that consistently identify those NGS calls that require confirmation. Most prior studies addressing this question have limitations: These studies are generally small, omit statistical justification, and explore limited aspects of the underlying data. The rigorous definition of criteria that separate high-accuracy NGS calls from those that may or may not be true remains a critical issue.\\n\\nWe analyzed five reference samples and over 80,000 patient specimens from two laboratories. We examined quality metrics for approximately 200,000 NGS calls with orthogonal data, including 1662 false positives. A classification algorithm used these data to identify a battery of criteria that flag 100% of false positives as requiring confirmation (CI lower bound: 98.5-99.8% depending on variant type) while minimizing the number of flagged true positives. These criteria identify false positives that the previously published criteria miss. Sampling analysis showed that smaller datasets resulted in less effective criteria.\\n\\nOur methodology for determining test and laboratory-specific criteria can be generalized into a practical approach that can be used by many laboratories to help reduce the cost and time burden of confirmation without impacting clinical accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In rodents, the progression of extrastriate areas located laterally to primary visual cortex (V1) has been assigned to a putative object-processing pathway (homologous to the primate ventral stream), based on anatomical considerations. Recently, we found functional support for such attribution (Tafazoli et al., 2017), by showing that this cortical progression is specialized for coding object identity despite view changes - the hallmark property of a ventral-like pathway. Here, we sought to clarify what computations are at the base of such specialization. To this aim, we performed multi-electrode recordings from V1 and laterolateral area LL (at the apex of the putative ventral-like hierarchy) of male adult rats, during the presentation of drifting gratings and noise movies. We found that the extent to which neuronal responses were entrained to the phase of the gratings sharply dropped from V1 to LL, along with the quality of the receptive fields inferred through reverse correlation. Concomitantly, the tendency of neurons to respond to different oriented gratings increased, while the sharpness of orientation tuning declined. Critically, these trends are consistent with the nonlinear summation of visual inputs that is expected to take place along the ventral stream, according to the predictions of hierarchical models of ventral computations and a meta-analysis of the monkey literature. This suggests an intriguing homology between the mechanisms responsible for building up shape selectivity and transformation tolerance in the visual cortex of primates and rodents, reasserting the potential of the latter as models to investigate ventral stream functions at the circuitry level.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDespite the growing popularity of rodents as models of visual functions, it remains unclear whether their visual cortex contains specialized modules for processing shape information. To addresses this question, we compared how neuronal tuning evolves from rat primary visual cortex (V1) to a downstream visual cortical region (area LL) that previous work has implicated in shape processing. In our experiments, LL neurons displayed a stronger tendency to respond to drifting gratings with different orientations, while maintaining a sustained response across the whole duration of the drift cycle. These trends match the increased complexity of pattern selectivity and the augmented tolerance to stimulus translation found in monkey visual temporal cortex, thus revealing a homology between shape processing in rodents and primates.",

    "abstract": "The traditional N2 and P3 components of the human event-related potential (ERP) have been associated with cognitive control. However, recent research has found that the traditional target P3 consists of a mixture of stimulus-locked, response-locked, and latency variable P3-like positivities that can be functionally and topographically dissociated from one another. The current study aimed to extend previous results by examining target N2 and P3-like subcomponents indexing conflict detection and context updating at both low- and high-order levels in the neural hierarchy during control of target detection in a flanker task. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were recorded from 45 young adults while they completed a hybrid go/nogo flanker task, and Residue Iteration Decomposition (RIDE) was applied to functionally dissociate these peaks and establish their roles in conflict detection and context updating. Frequentist and Bayesian analyses showed a stimulus-locked frontal N2 revealing early conflict detection and fast categorization of nogo, congruous and incongruous trials, resulting in subsequent frontal P3-like activity (high-order context updating) elicited by infrequent nogo trials in the latency-variable RIDE cluster, and by the perceptually difficult incongruous trials in the response-locked cluster. In turn, the perceptually easier and more frequent congruous trials did not elicit frontal P3-like activity, although all trial types did elicit parietally distributed P3-like activity (low-order context updating), mostly within the latency-variable cluster. These novel findings support the presence of up to three distinct high-order task-set units regulating performance in our flanker task, as indexed by split-second, dynamic information transmission across frontal and parietal scalp regions.",

Applying it to 46 clinical samples taken from early infections of the human-infecting viruses HIV, RSV and CMV, revealed large differences in within-host genetic diversity among virus populations. Haplotype reconstruction revealed that increased diversity was mostly driven by multiple transmitted/founder viruses in HIV and CMV samples. Conversely, we detected an abundance of defective virus genomes (DVGs) in RSV samples, including hyper-edited genomes, nonsense mutations and single point deletions. Higher proportions of DVGs correlated with increased viral loads, suggesting increased cellular co-infection rates, which enable DVG persistence. AccuNGS establishes a general platform that allows detecting DVGs, and in general, rare variants that drive evolution.",

Experimental diabetes mellitus can be induced completely in less than 72 hours after STZ intraperitoneal injection. Streptozotocin(STZ) was purchased from Sigma company. Diabetic and control group rats were kept separately in different metabolic cages, and their blood glucose(BG), hematological parameters, serum protein electrophoretic pattern and hepatic transaminases level were analyzed and comparison was done.\\n\\nResultsIn our investigation, Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus(IDDM) was completely induced one week after single intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg BW. Diabetes mellitus induction was verified by measuring fasting plasma glucose level in blood samples of rats. Level of blood glucose, hematological parameters, serum protein electrophoretic pattern and hepatic transaminase enzymes level, were all measured. In diabetic group rats level of blood glucose (BG), hepatic transaminase enzymes (SGOT & SGPT), serum 1-globulin and {beta}-globulin were significantly increased but in albumin, albumin/globulin ratio (A/G ratio) and serum 2-globulin a significant decrease was observed in diabetic rats in comparison with normal rats.\\n\\nConclusionExtensive inflammation and tissue necrosis induced following diabetes mellitus induction in rats. Significant alterations were observed in serum protein electrophoresis fractions and hepatic transaminase enzymes level due to streptozotocin cytotoxic impacts on some tissues specifically liver.\\n\\nBecause of extensive {beta}-cells necrosis and degeneration caused by streptozotocin exposure, high level of blood glucose(diabetic hyperglycemia) was observed in diabetic rats. This type of experimentally induced diabetes mellitus would highly affect hematological parameters.

    "abstract": "The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a multifaceted region of cortex, contributing to several cognitive processes including sensorimotor integration and spatial navigation. Although recent years have seen a considerable rise in the use of rodents, particularly mice, to investigate PPC and related networks, a coherent anatomical definition of PPC in the mouse is still lacking. To address this, we delineated the mouse PPC using cyto- and chemoarchitectural markers from Nissl-, parvalbumin- and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2-staining. Additionally, we performed bilateral triple anterograde tracer injections in primary visual cortex (V1) and prepared flattened tangential sections from one hemisphere and coronal sections from the other, allowing us to co-register the cytoarchitectural features of PPC with V1 projections. In charting the location of extrastriate areas and the architectural features of PPC in the context of each other, we reconcile different, widely used conventions for demarcating PPC in the mouse. Furthermore, triple anterograde tracer injections in PPC showed strong projections to associative thalamic nuclei as well as higher visual areas, orbitofrontal, cingulate and secondary motor cortices. Retrograde circuit mapping with rabies virus further showed that all cortical connections were reciprocal. These combined approaches provide a coherent definition of mouse PPC that incorporates laminar architecture, extrastriate projections, thalamic, and cortico-cortical connections.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCurrently, the early pre-clinical detection of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is difficult as biomarkers are not specific for the cardiomyopathic process. The underlying molecular mechanisms leading to heart failure remain elusive, highlighting the need for identification of cardiac-specific markers. The growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) and its ligand ghrelin are present in cardiac tissue and are known to contribute to myocardial energetics. Here, we examined tissue ghrelin-GHSR levels as specific markers of cardiac dysfunction in patients who underwent cardiac transplantation.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsSamples of cardiac tissue were obtained from 10 cardiac transplant patients at the time of organ harvesting, and during serial post-transplant biopsies. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy using a novel fluorescent ghrelin analog was used to measure levels of GHSR, and immunofluorescence was used to measure levels of ghrelin, b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and tissue markers of cardiomyocyte contractility and growth. GHSR and ghrelin expression levels were highly variable in the explanted heart, less in the grafted heart biopsies. GHSR and ghrelin were strongly positively correlated, and both markers were negatively correlated with LV ejection fraction. Ghrelin had stronger positive correlations than BNP with the signaling markers for contractility and growth.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data suggest that GHSR-ghrelin have potential use as an integrated marker of cardiac dysfunction. Interestingly, tissue ghrelin appeared to be a more sensitive indicator than BNP to the biochemical processes that are characteristic of heart failure. This work allows for further use of ghrelin-GHSR to interrogate cardiac-specific biochemical mechanisms in pre-clinical stages of HF.\\n\\nPrecisThis study shows the relationships between GHSR, ghrelin, and signaling molecules with relation to heart function in human heart failure with tissue from diseased heart and healthy heart biopsies.",

    "abstract": "The conserved fatty acyl reductase (FAR) family is involved in biosynthesis of fatty alcohols that serve a range of biological roles. In moths, butterflies (Lepidoptera), and bees (Hymenoptera), FARs biosynthesize fatty alcohol pheromones participating in mate-finding strategies. Using a combination of next-generation sequencing, analysis of transposable elements (TE) in the genomic environment of FAR genes, and functional characterization of FARs from Bombus lucorum, B. lapidarius, and B. terrestris, we uncovered a massive expansion of the FAR gene family in Hymenoptera, presumably facilitated by TEs. Expansion occurred in the common ancestor of bumblebees (Bombini) and stingless bees (Meliponini) after their divergence from the honeybee lineage. We found that FARs from the expanded FAR-A orthology group contributed to the species-specific male marking pheromone composition. Our results indicate that TE-mediated expansion and functional diversification of the FAR gene family played a key role in the evolution of pheromone communication in the crown group of Hymenoptera.\\n\\nAbbreviationsMMP: male marking pheromone, FA: fatty acid, FAME: fatty acid methyl ester, FAR: fatty acyl reductase, LG: labial gland, FB: fat body, TE: transposable element.",

This represents the first evidence of implementing a gene editing strategy in a murine safe harbor locus that phenotypically corrects primary cells derived from a mouse model of Fanconi anemia (FA).\\n\\nBy co-delivering TALENs and a donor therapeutic FANCA cassette template to the Mbs85 locus (ortholog of the hAAVS1 safe harbor locus), we achieved efficient gene targeting (23%) in FA mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). This resulted in the phenotypic correction of these cells, as revealed by the improvement of their hypersensitivity to mitomycinC. Moreover, robust evidence of targeted integration was observed in murine WT and FA-A hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) reaching mean targeted integration values of 20.98% and 16.33% respectively, with phenotypic correction of FA HPCs. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a therapeutic targeted integration strategy in a murine safe harbor locus, such as the Mbs85 gene, of MEFs and murine HPC from a FA mouse model.",

We performed a systematic secondary-variant burden analysis of two independent Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) cohorts with known recessive biallelic pathogenic mutations in one of 17 BBS genes for each individual. We observed a significant enrichment of trans-acting rare nonsynonymous secondary variants compared to either population controls or to a cohort of individuals with a non-BBS diagnosis and recessive variants in the same gene set. Strikingly, we found a significant over-representation of secondary alleles in chaperonin-encoding genes, a finding corroborated by the observation of epistatic interactions involving this complex in vivo.

    "abstract": "Telomeres are dynamic nucleoprotein structures capping the physical ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. They consist of telomeric DNA repeats (TTAGGG), the shelterin protein complex, and Telomeric Repeat-Containing RNA (TERRA). Proposed TERRA functions are wide-ranging and include telomere maintenance, telomerase inhibition, genomic stability, and alternative lengthening of telomere. However, the role of TERRA in primordial germ cells (PGCs), the embryonic precursors of germ cells, is unknown. Using RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) we identify TERRA in PGCs soon after these cells have migrated to, and become established in, the developing gonad. RNA-FISH showed the presence of TERRA transcripts in female PGCs at 11.5, 12.5 and 13.5 days post-coitum. In male PGCs, however, TERRA transcripts are observable from 12.5 dpc. Using qPCR we evaluated chromosome-specific TERRA expression, and demonstrated that TERRA levels vary with sex and gestational age, and that transcription of TERRA from specific chromosomes is sexually dimorphic. TERRA interacting proteins were evaluated using Identification of Direct RNA Interacting Proteins (iDRiP) which identified 48 in female and 26 in male protein interactors specifically within nuclear extracts from PGCs at 13.5 dpc. We validated two different proteins the splicing factor, proline- and glutamine-rich (SFPQ) in PGCs and Non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein (NONO) in somatic cells. Our results show that, TERRA interacting proteins are determined by sex in both PGCs and somatic cells. Taken together, our data indicate that TERRA expression and interactome during PGC development are regulated in a dynamic fashion that is dependent on gestational age and sex.\\n\\nResearch reported in this publication was supported in part by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number K99HD090289 to M.A.B-E.

Astrocyte activation occurs in response to diverse insults, and plays a critical role in brain health and disease. We report that the core clock protein BMAL1 regulates astrogliosis in a synergistic manner via a cell-autonomous mechanism, and via a lesser non-cell-autonomous signal from neurons. Astrocyte-specific Bmal1 deletion induces astrocyte activation in vitro and in vivo, mediated in part by suppression of glutathione-s-transferase signaling. Functionally, loss of Bmal1 in astrocytes promotes neuronal death in vitro. Our results demonstrate that the core clock protein BMAL1 regulates astrocyte activation and function in vivo, elucidating a novel mechanism by which the circadian clock could influence many aspects of brain function and neurologic disease.",

We present a minimally-invasive strategy combining mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) with a chitosan-collagen matrix to form modular microtissues designed for delivery through a needle to conformally fill cavital defects. Implantation of microtissues into a calvarial defect in the mouse showed that osteogenically pre-differentiated MSC resulted in complete bridging of the cavity, while undifferentiated MSC produced mineralized tissue only in apposition to native bone. Decreasing the implant volume reduced bone regeneration, while increasing the MSC concentration also attenuated bone formation, suggesting that the cell-matrix ratio is important in achieving a robust response. Conformal filling of the defect with microtissues in a carrier gel resulted in complete healing. Taken together, these results show that modular microtissues can be used to augment the differentiated function of MSC and provide an extracellular environment that potentiates bone repair.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac rotors are believed to be a major driver source of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), and their spatiotemporal characterization is essential for successful ablation procedures. However, electrograms guided ablation have not been proven to have benefit over empirical ablation thus far, and there is a strong need of improving the localization of cardiac arrhythmogenic targets for ablation. A new approach for characterize rotors is proposed that is based on induced spatial temperature gradients (STGs), and investigated by theoretical study using numerical simulations. We hypothesize that such gradients will cause rotor drifting due to induced spatial heterogeneity in excitability, so that rotors could be driven towards the ablating probe. Numerical simulations were conducted in single cell and 2D atrial models using AF remodeled kinetics. STGs were applied either linearly on the entire tissue or as a small local perturbation, and the major ion channel rate constants were adjusted following Arrhenius equation. In the AF-remodeled single cell, recovery time increased exponentially with decreasing temperatures, despite the marginal effect of temperature on the action potential duration. In 2D models, spiral waves drifted with drifting velocity components affected by both temperature gradient direction and the spiral wave rotation direction. Overall, spiral waves drifted towards the colder tissue region associated with global minimum of excitability. A local perturbation with a temperature of T=28{degrees}C was found optimal for spiral wave attraction for the studied conditions. This work provides a preliminary proof-of-concept for a potential prospective technique for rotor attraction. We envision that the insights from this study will be utilize in the future in the design of a new methodology for AF characterization and termination during ablation procedures.",

    "abstract": "Patterning of a continuously growing naive field in the context of a life-long growing organ, the teleost eye is of highest functional relevance. Intrinsic and extrinsic signals were proposed to regulate lineage specification in progenitors that exit the stem cell niche in the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ). The proper cell type composition arising from those progenitors is prerequisite for retinal function. Our findings in the teleost medaka (Oryzias latipes) uncover that the Notch-Atoh7 axis continuously patterns the CMZ. The complement of cell-types originating from the two juxtaposed progenitors marked by Notch or Atoh7 activity contains all constituents of a retinal column. Modulation of Notch signalling specifically in Atoh7-expressing cells demonstrates the crucial role of this axis in generating the correct cell type proportions. After transiently blocking Notch signalling, retinal patterning and differentiation is reinitiated de novo. Taken together we show that Notch activity in the CMZ continuously structures the growing retina by juxtaposing Notch and Atoh7 progenitors giving rise to distinct, complementary lineages, revealing a coupling of de novo patterning and cell-type specification in the respective lineages.",

The conserved RNA helicase Vasa is an essential piRNA pathway component, but has additional important developmental functions. Here we address the importance of Vasa-dependent transposon control in the Drosophila female germline and early embryos. We find that transient loss of vasa expression during early oogenesis leads to transposon up-regulation in supporting nurse cells of the fly egg-chamber. We show that elevated transposon levels have dramatic consequences, as de-repressed transposons accumulate in the oocyte where they cause DNA damage. We find that suppression of Chk2-mediated DNA damage signaling in vasa mutant females restores oogenesis and egg production. Damaged DNA and up-regulated transposons are transmitted from the mother to the embryos, which sustain severe nuclear defects and arrest development. Our findings reveal that the Vasa-dependent protection against selfish genetic elements in the nuage of nurse cell is essential to prevent DNA damage-induced arrest of embryonic development.",

We find that, in contrast to what has been described in somatic cells, MTA proteins are not mutually exclusive within ES cell NuRD and, despite subtle differences in chromatin binding and biochemical interactions, serve largely redundant functions. Nevertheless, ES cells lacking all three MTA proteins represent a complete NuRD null and are viable, allowing us to identify a previously undetected function for NuRD in maintaining differentiation trajectory during early stages of lineage commitment.",

This review identified the need for the application of quantitative, hypothesis-based approaches to understand temporal change in community composition, particularly for small datasets with less than 15 temporal replicates. To address this gap, we: (1) conceptually present how temporal patterns in community dynamics can be framed as specific, testable hypotheses; (2) provide three fully-worked case-studies, complete with R code, demonstrating multivariate analysis methods for temporal hypothesis testing and pattern visualisation; and (3) present a road map for testing specific, quantitative hypotheses relating to the underlying mechanisms of temporal community dynamics.",

Enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1) heterodimers are recruited by Toll-interleukin1-receptor domain NLRs (TNLs) to transcriptionally mobilize resistance pathways.

We identify EP-domain positively charged residues lining a cavity that are essential for TNL immunity signalling, beyond heterodimer formation. Mutating arginine (R493) to alanine creates a weak EDS1 allele which disables TNL immunity against bacteria producing a virulence factor, coronatine (COR). Arabidopsis plants expressing EDS1R493A are slow to mobilize defence gene expression changes, independently of COR. The transcriptional delay has severe consequences for pathogen resistance and for countering bacterial COR. We uncover a set of host immunity genes whose repression by COR is blocked by wild-type EDS1 but not by EDS1R493A in the TNL response. These data uncover an EDS1 signalling surface lining the heterodimer EP-domain cavity which confers timely transcriptional reprogramming of host defence pathways and blocks bacterial virulence in NLR receptor immunity.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic mechanism that participates in gene regulation under abiotic stresses in plants. Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is typically considered a drought-tolerant crop but highly susceptible to waterlogging, a property attributed to its presumed origin in Africa or India. Understanding DNA methylation patterns in sesame under drought and waterlogging conditions can provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying its contrasting responses to these principal abiotic stresses. Here, we combined Methylation-Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism and transcriptome analyses to profile cytosine methylation patterns, gene expression alteration, and their interplay in drought-tolerant and waterlogging-tolerant sesame genotypes under control, stress and recovery conditions. Our data showed that drought stress strongly induced de novo methylation (DNM) whereas most of the loci were demethylated (DM) during the recovery phase. In contrast, waterlogging decreased the level of methylation under stress but during the recovery phase, both DM and DNM were concomitantly deployed. In both stresses, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were highly correlated with the methylation patterns. We observed that DM was associated with the up-regulation of the DEGs while DNM was correlated with the down-regulation of the DEGs. In addition, we sequenced 44 differentially methylated regions of which 90% overlapped with the promoters and coding sequences of the DEGs. Altogether, we demonstrated that sesame has divergent epigenetic programs that respond to drought and waterlogging stresses. Our results also highlighted the possible interplay among DNA methylation and gene expression, which may modulate the contrasting responses to drought and waterlogging in sesame.",

    "abstract": "The modelbase package is a free expandable Python package for building and analysing dynamic mathematical models of biological systems. Originally it was designed for the simulation of metabolic systems, but it can be used for virtually any deterministic chemical processes. modelbase provides easy construction methods to define reactions and their rates. Based on the rates and stoichiometries, the system of differential equations is assembled automatically. modelbase minimises the constraints imposed on the user, allowing for easy and dynamic access to all variables, including derived ones, in a convenient manner. A simple incorporation of algebraic equations is, for example, convenient to study systems with rapid equilibrium or quasi steady-state approximations. Moreover, modelbase provides construction methods that automatically build all isotope-specific versions of a particular reaction, making it a convenient tool to analyse non-steady state isotope-labelling experiments.",

    "abstract": "Collective systems such as fish schools, bird flocks, and neural networks are comprised of many mutually-influencing individuals, often without long-term leaders, well-defined hierarchies, or persistent relationships. The remarkably organized group-level behaviors readily observable in these systems contrast with the ad hoc, often difficult to observe, and complex interactions among their constituents. While these complex individual-level dynamics are ultimately the drivers of group-level coordination, they do not necessarily offer the most parsimonious description of a groups macroscopic properties. Rather, the factors underlying group organization may be better described at some intermediate, mesoscopic scale. We introduce a novel method from information-theoretic first principles to find a compressed description of a system based on the actions and mutual dependencies of its constituents, thus revealing the natural structure of the collective. We emphasize that this method is computationally tractable and requires neither pairwise nor Gaussian assumptions about individual interactions.",

    "abstract": "Electrogram-guided ablation for mapping of abnormal atrial activity has become increasingly popular in clinical applications. However, current methods have several limitations, and none have been shown to increase the ablation procedure success rate more than empirical ablation procedures. Here we present a new approach to identify arrhythmogenic sources as targets for ablation. Based on our previous findings that rotor drifting can be characterized by a local temperature gradient within the tissue, this article describes an innovative induced temperature technique which exploits the fact that rotor drifting produces Doppler shifts in the dominant frequency as measured at stationary locations. A mathematical algorithm is detailed to solve the inverse problem, reconstruct the drift trajectory, and predict the rotor origin location. Mathematical modeling and computer simulations demonstrate the feasibility of the new approach for rotors and focal source, two well-known arrhythmogenic sources of irregular conduction. Performance was extensively investigated for different numbers of electrodes and varied SNRs. Random conditions were also taken into account, since the electrodes array position and the initial location of the rotor pivot can impact the outcomes. By using temperature perturbation and employing the Doppler algorithm, the rotor drift trajectory and the origin region is shown to be estimated. We consider ways in which this technique can be extended to differentiate between rotors and ectopic activity. Future experimental and clinical validations should lead to potential use in ablation procedures and improve localization capabilities, thus increasing success rates and optimizing arrhythmia management.",

    "abstract": "For many disease-causing virus species, global diversity is clustered into a taxonomy of subtypes with clinical significance. In particular, the classification of infections among the subtypes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a routine component of clinical management, and there are now many classification algorithms available for this purpose. Although several of these algorithms are similar in accuracy and speed, the majority are proprietary and require laboratories to transmit HIV-1 sequence data over the network to remote servers. This potentially exposes sensitive patient data to unauthorized access, and makes it impossible to determine how classifications are made and to maintain the data provenance of clinical bioinformatic workflows. We propose an open-source supervised and alignment-free subtyping method (KO_SCPCAPAMERISC_SCPCAP) that operates on k-mer frequencies in HIV-1 sequences. We performed a detailed study of the accuracy and performance of subtype classification in comparison to four state-of-the-art programs. Based on our testing data set of manually curated real-world HIV-1 sequences (n = 2, 784), Kameris obtained an overall accuracy of 97%, which matches or exceeds all other tested software, with a processing rate of over 1,500 sequences per second. Furthermore, our fully standalone general-purpose software provides key advantages in terms of data security and privacy, transparency and reproducibility. Finally, we show that our method is readily adaptable to subtype classification of other viruses including dengue, influenza A, and hepatitis B and C virus.",

Here we set to explore the role of corneal surface biomechanics in controlling epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation. Using non-contact high-resolution Brillouin spectro-microscopy we showed that the corneal outer edge (limbus) has significantly lower bulk modulus compared to the central cornea, and that this difference is precisely delimited in the organ. Furthermore, the areas of the limbus with distinctly softer properties were shown to be associated with limbal epithelial stem cell (LESC) residence. Based on these findings, we then provided the first demonstration of the capacity to modulate LESC phenotype, both in vivo and ex vivo, solely through the recreation/restoration of suitable biomechanical niches. These results thus confirm the fundamental role of corneal biomechanics in directing epithelial stem cell behavior.",

    "abstract": "Our recent analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation data in men and women exposed to the Dutch Famine met passionate criticism by several researchers active on Twitter. It also prompted a more reasoned letter by Richmond and colleagues. At the core of the debate is the proper interpretation of findings from a mediation analysis. We used this method to identify specific DNA methylation changes that statistically provide a link between prenatal exposure to famine and adult metabolic traits. Our critics first argue that our results do not suggest mediation but reverse-causation, where famine-induced metabolic traits drive changes in DNA methylation. We rebut this scenario in a simulation study showing that our test of mediation was unlikely to become statistically significant in the case of reverse-causation. Some critics then argue that Mendelian randomization provides the sole path to correct inference. This belief misses a crucial point: DNA methylation, especially when measured in peripheral blood, is not likely to be a causal mediator from a biological point of view. It could however be a proxy of epigenetic regulation changes in specific tissues, for example at the level of transcription factor binding. If so, a Mendelian randomization approach using genetic variants affecting local DNA methylation in blood will be disconnected from the underlying biological mechanism and is bound to yield false-negative results. Our new simulation studies strengthen the original reasoning that the relationship between prenatal famine and metabolic traits is statistically mediated by specific DNA methylation changes while the specific molecular mechanism awaits elucidation.",

However, closing genomes is often costly and assembling short reads from genomes that are repetitive and/or have extreme %GC content remains challenging. Long-read, single-molecule sequencing technologies such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION have the potential to overcome these difficulties, although the best approach for harnessing their potential remains poorly evaluated.\\n\\nResultsWe sequenced nine bacterial genomes spanning a wide range of GC contents using Illumina MiSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing technologies to determine the advantages of each approach, both individually and combined. Assemblies using only MiSeq reads were highly accurate but lacked contiguity, a deficiency that was partially overcome by adding MinION reads to these assemblies. Even more contiguous genome assemblies were generated by using MinION reads for initial assembly, but these were more error-prone and required further polishing. This was especially pronounced when Illumina libraries were biased, as was the case for our strains with both high and low GC content. Increased genome contiguity dramatically improved the annotation of insertion sequences and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, likely because long-reads can disambiguate these highly repetitive but biologically important genomic regions.\\n\\nConclusionsGenome assembly using short-reads is challenged by repetitive sequences and extreme GC contents. Our results indicate that these difficulties can be largely overcome by using single-molecule, long-read sequencing technologies such as the Oxford Nanopore MinION. Using MinION reads for assembly followed by polishing with Illumina reads generated the most contiguous genomes and enabled the accurate annotation of important but difficult to sequence genomic features such as insertion sequences and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters.

Cue-approach training (CAT) has been shown to induce preference changes lasting months following a mere association of items with a neutral cue and a speeded response, without external reinforcements. We utilized this paradigm to study preference representation and modification in the brain without external reinforcements. We scanned 36 participants with fMRI during a novel passive viewing task before, after and 30 days following CAT. We pre-registered the predictions that activity in regions related to memory, top-down attention and value processing underlie behavioral change. We found that bottom-up neural mechanisms, involving visual processing regions, were associated with immediate behavioral change, while reduced top-down parietal activity and enhanced hippocampal activity were related to the long-term change. Enhanced activity in value-related regions was found both immediately and in the long-term. Our findings suggest a novel neural mechanism of preference representation and modification. We suggest that non-reinforced change occurs initially in perceptual representation of items, which putatively lead to long-term changes in memory and top-down processes. These findings could lead to implementation of bottom-up instead of top-down targeted interventions to accomplish long-lasting behavioral change.",

    "abstract": "Humans have a remarkable capacity to learn novel movement patterns in a wide variety of contexts. Recent work has shown that, when countering external forces, the nervous system adjusts not only voluntary (ie. feedforward) control but also reflex (ie. feedback) responses. Here we show that directly altering the physical properties of the arm (i.e. intersegmental dynamics) causes the nervous system to adjust feedforward control and that this learning also transfers to feedback responses even though they were never directly trained. In our first experiment, we altered intersegmental dynamics by asking participants to generate pure elbow movements with the shoulder joint either free to rotate or locked. Locking the shoulder joint cancels the interaction forces that arise at the shoulder during forearm rotation and thus removes the need to activate shoulder muscles to prevent shoulder joint rotation. We first asked whether the nervous system learns this altered mapping of intersegmental dynamics. In the baseline phase, we found robust activation of shoulder flexor muscles for pure elbow flexion trials prior to movement onset - as required to counter the intersegmental dynamics. After locking the shoulder joint in the adaptation phase, we found a substantial reduction in shoulder muscle activity over many trials. After unlocking the shoulder joint in the post-adaptation phase, we observed after-effects, as participants made systematic hand path errors. In our second experiment, we investigated whether such learning transfers to feedback control. Mechanical perturbations applied to the limb in the baseline phase revealed that feedback responses, like feedforward control, also appropriately countered intersegmental dynamics. In the adaptation phase, we found a substantial reduction in shoulder feedback responses - as appropriate for the altered intersegmental dynamics. We also found that this decay in shoulder feedback responses correlated across subjects with the amount of decay during feedforward control. Our work adds to the growing evidence that feedforward and feedback control share an internal model of the arms dynamics.",

Using yeast two-hybrid assays and rice tillering assays, we identified a triazole urea compound KK094 as a potent inhibitor of strigolactone receptors. The LC-MS/MS analysis and X-ray crystallography concluded that KK094 was hydrolyzed by D14, and that a reaction product of this degradation covalently binds to the Ser residue of the catalytic triad of D14. We also identified KK052 and KK073, whose effects on D14-D53/D14-SLR1 complex formation were opposite due to a trifluoromethyl group on its benzene ring.

A robot moving between plants growing in 15L pots monitors plant water status and phenotypes plant or leaf morphology, from which we can compute more complex traits such as the response of leaf expansion (LE) or plant transpiration (TR) to water deficit. Here, we illustrate the platform capabilities for sunflower on two practical cases: a genetic and genomics study for the response to drought of yield-related traits and a simulation study, where we use measured parameters as inputs for a crop simulation model. For the genetic study, classical measurements of thousand-kernel weight (TKW) were done on a sunflower bi-parental population under water stress and control conditions managed automatically. The association study using the TKW drought-response highlighted five genetic markers. A complementary transcriptomic experiment identified closeby candidate genes differentially expressed in the parental backgrounds in drought conditions. For the simulation study, we used the SUNFLO crop simulation model to assess the impact of two traits measured on the platform (LE and TR) on crop yield in a large population of environments. We conducted simulations in 42 contrasted locations across Europe and 21 years of climate data. We defined the pattern of abiotic stresses occurring at this continental scale and identified ideotypes (i.e. genotypes with specific traits values) that are more adapted to specific environment types. This study exemplifies how phenotyping platforms can help with the identification of the genetic architecture of complex response traits and the estimation of eco-physiological model parameters in order to define ideotypes adapted to different environmental conditions.",

The OJIP induction has been widely applied in plant science, agriculture engineering, and environmental engineering. While the J and I phases are related to transitions of photochemical reaction redox states, characteristic fluorescence intensities for the two phases (Fj and Fi) are often treated as fixed time points in routine measurement and thus do not account for variations in plant and experimental conditions, which (1) neglects the time differences, potentially useful information for characterizing plant status and environmental factors, and (2) leads to errors in measured Fj and Fi values. In this work, a method for consistent measurement of Fj and Fi was developed through polynomial fitting and curvature analysis. The method measures the curvatures in the OJIP curve and automatically tracks the characteristic transition points under variable sample and experimental conditions. Experiments were carried out to demonstrate the concept and classification capabilities of the developed method. This research established a new framework to analyze ChlF and enhanced the applications of ChlF.",

    "abstract": "Many undergraduate introductory microbiology laboratory courses teach basic principles of bacteriology using classical protocol-based experiments, with limited critical thinking and inquiry-based learning practices. We initiated a comprehensive redesign in our General Microbiology Laboratory course to promote scientific critical and creative thinking, while strengthening core microbiology concepts and skills. As part of the redesign, a series of authentic discovery-driven labs, based on cucumber fermentations, were developed as an independent research module within the course curriculum. Integrating discovery-driven labs allowed students to be engaged problem solvers, applying the scientific process to develop hypotheses, design experiments, utilize quantitative reasoning, and effectively communicate results. The inquiry-guided research project was developed to evaluate the minimum concentration of salt (NaCl) required in fermentation brine to safely, and effectively, ferment cucumbers. Over 5 weeks, students assess different aspects of the fermentation process, including quantifying bacterial populations with differential and selective media, measuring pH and glucose concentration of brine solutions, and characterizing the microbial metabolic potential. Additionally, students isolate an unknown bacterium from their fermentations, identifying and characterizing the isolate using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolic tests. Throughout the research project, students collect, graph, and analyze their observations, culminating in students creating and presenting a scientific research poster. With this lab redesign, students generate new knowledge contributing to our understanding of microbial ecology within food fermentations, learn core microbiology skills and techniques, and develop critical and creative thinking skills. The impact of their research is valuable to science educators, researchers, and industry partners.",

    "abstract": "Feces contain information about the donor and potentially attracts both conspecifics and predators and parasites. The excretory system must be coordinated with other behaviors in insects. We found that crickets start walking forward following excretion of feces. Most intact crickets walked around the experimental arena, stopped at a particular site and raised up their body with a slight backward drift to excrete feces. After the feces dropped on the floor, the animal started walking with a random gait pattern away from the feces, and then changed the gait pattern to a tripod gait. Headless cricket also showed walking following excretion. In more than half of excretion events, headless crickets walked backward before excretion. The posture adopted during excretion was similar to that of intact crickets, and post-excretory forward walking was also observed. The occurrence rate of post-excretory walking was more than that of intact crickets. The gait pattern during forward walking was random and never transitioned to a tripod gait in the headless crickets. In animals whose abdominal nerve cords were cut, in any position, pre- or post-excretion walking was not shown in both intact and headless crickets, although they excreted feces. These results indicate that ascending signals from the terminal abdominal ganglion initiate leg movement through the neuronal circuits within thoracic ganglia, and that descending signals from the brain must regulate leg the motor circuit to express the appropriate walking gait.",

    "abstract": "Identification of genetic variants that influence susceptibility to chronic pain is key to identifying molecular mechanisms and targets for effective and safe therapeutic alternatives to opioids. To identify genes and variants associated with chronic pain, we measured late phase response to formalin injection in 275 male and female Diversity Outbred (DO) mice genotyped for over 70 thousand SNPs. One quantitative trait locus (QTL) reached genome-wide significance on chromosome 1 with a support interval of 3.1 Mb. This locus, Nociq4 (nociceptive sensitivity inflammatory QTL 4; MGI:5661503), harbors the well-known pain gene Trpa1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily A, member 1). Trpa1 is a cation channel known to play an important role in acute and chronic pain in both humans and mice. Analysis of DO founder strain allele effects revealed a significant effect of the CAST/EiJ allele at Trpa1, with CAST/EiJ carrier mice showing an early, but not late, response to formalin relative to carriers of the seven other inbred founder alleles (A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ). We characterized possible functional consequences of sequence variants in Trpa1 by assessing channel conductance, Trpa1/Trpv1 interactions, and isoform expression. The phenotypic differences observed in CAST/EiJ relative to C57BL/6J carriers were best explained by Trpa1 isoform expression differences, implicating a splice junction variant as the causal functional variant. This study demonstrates the utility of advanced, high-precision genetic mapping populations in resolving specific molecular mechanisms of variation in pain sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "The architecture of interaction networks has been extensively studied in the past decades, and different topologies have been observed in natural systems. Despite several phenomenological explanations proposed, we still understand little of the mechanisms that generate those topologies. Here we present a mechanistic model based on the integrative hypothesis of specialization, which aims at explaining the emergence of topology and specialization in consumer-resource networks. By following three first-principles and adjusting five parameters, our model was able to generate synthetic weighted networks that show the main patterns of topology and specialization observed in nature. Our results prove that topology emergence is possible without network-level selection. In our simulations, the intensity of trade-offs in the performance of each consumer species on different resource species is the main factor driving network topology. We predict that interaction networks with low species diversity and low dissimilarity between resources should have a nested topology, although more diverse networks with large dissimilarity should have a compound topology. Additionally, our results highlight scale as a key factor. Our model generates predictions consistent with ecological and evolutionary theories and real-world observations. Therefore, it supports the IHS as a useful conceptual framework to study the architecture of interaction networks.",

    "abstract": "Plentiful evidence shows an historic and continuing gender gap in participation and success in scientific research. However, less attention has been directed at clarifying obscured contributions of women to science. The lack of visible women role models (particularly in computational fields) contributes to a reduced sense of belonging and retention among women. We seek to counteract this cycle by illuminating the contribution of women programmers to the foundation of our own fields--population and evolutionary genetics. We consider past  acknowledged programmers (APs), who developed, ran, and sometimes analyzed the results of early computer programs. Due to authorship norms at the time, these programmers were credited in the acknowledgments sections of manuscripts, rather than being recognized as authors. For example, one acknowledgement reads \\\"I thanks Mrs. M. Wu for help with the numerical work, and in particular for computing table I.\\\". We identified APs in Theoretical Population Biology articles published between 1970 and 1990. While only 7% of authors were women, 43% of APs were women. This significant difference (p = 4.0x10-10) demonstrates a substantial proportion of womens contribution to foundational computational population genetics has been unrecognized. The proportion of women APs, as well as number of APs decreased over time. These observations correspond to the masculinization of computer programming, and the shifting of programming responsibilities to individuals credited as authors (likely graduate students). Finally, we note recurrent APs who contributed to several highly-cited manuscripts. We conclude that, while previously overlooked, historically, women have made substantial contributions to computational biology.",

    "abstract": "Old age mortality decline has driven recent increases in lifespans, but there is no agreement about trends in the age-pattern of old deaths. Some hypotheses argue that old-age deaths should have become compressed at high ages, others that old-age deaths should have become more dispersed with age, and yet others are consistent with little change in dispersion. However, direct analyses of old-age deaths presents unusual challenges: death rates at the oldest ages are always noisy; published life tables must assume an asymptotic age pattern of deaths; and the definition of \\\"old age\\\" changes as lives lengthen. Here we use robust percentile-based methods to overcome these challenges and show, for 5 decades in 20 developed countries, that old-age survival follows an advancing front, like a traveling wave. The front lies between the 25th and 90th percentiles of old-age deaths, advancing with nearly constant long-term shape but annual fluctuations in speed. The existence of this front leads to several predictions that we verify, e.g., that advances in life expectancy at age 65 are highly correlated with the advance of the 25th percentile, but not with distances between higher percentiles. Our unexpected result has implications for biological hypotheses about human aging, and for future mortality change.",

    "abstract": "The heritable component to a long and healthy life is likely to involve the actions and interactions of both nuclear and mitochondrial genetic variants. Using computerized genealogical records with accompanying cause of death information from the Utah population, we previously reported cause-specific mortality rate distributions associated with the nuclear genetic component of familial exceptional longevity. Here we identify Utah matrilineages (mitochondrial lineages) in which overall survival is better than expected, and compare cause-specific mortality rates in those matrilineages to cause-specific mortality rates in the general population. We also examine the effects on cause-specific mortality of interactions between the nuclear and mitochondrial components of familial excess longevity (nuclear FEL and mtFEL). Among individuals from the bottom quartile of nuclear FEL, those who were also in the top quartile for mtFEL had lower all-cause, heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes mortality rates than those in the bottom quartile of mtFEL. In contrast, among individuals from the top quartile of nuclear FEL, the mortality rates from these diseases were similar for those also in the top quartile of mtFEL vs. those also in the bottom quartile of mtFEL, with the exception of diabetes mortality, which was dramatically suppressed in the high nuclear FEL + high mtFEL group as compared to the high nuclear FEL + low mtFEL group. Moreover, the highest mortality rates from diabetes were found in individuals aged 90 years or older who were members of both the high nuclear FEL and low mtFEL quartiles. These results support the hypothesis that some nuclear genetic variants contributing to long life carry an increased risk of dying from diabetes that is strongly ameliorated by some mitochondrial DNA variants.",

Central sensitization and features suggestive of neuropathic pain before surgery may result in a poor outcome post-operatively.

Response to surgery was compared between groups using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and the presence of moderate to severe long-term pain 12 months after arthroplasty. The analyses were replicated in a larger independent cohort study (n=404). 120 patients were recruited to the main study cohort: 63 (52%) nociceptive pain; 32 (27%) unclear pain; 25 (21%) neuropathic-like pain. Patients with neuropathic-like pain had significantly worse OKS pre and post-operatively, compared to the nociceptive pain group, independent of age, sex and BMI. At 12-months post-operatively the mean OKS was 4 points lower in the neuropathic-like group compared with the nociceptive group in the study cohort (non-significant); with a difference of 5 points in the replication cohort (p<0.001). Moderate to severe long-term pain after arthroplasty at 12-months was present in 50% of the neuropathic-like pain group versus 24% in the nociceptive pain group, in the replication cohort (p<0.001).

    "abstract": "Metabolic state is a potent modulator of sleep and circadian behavior and animals acutely modulate their sleep in accordance with internal energy stores and food availability. Across phyla, hormones secreted from adipose tissue act in the brain to control neural physiology and behavior to modulate sleep and metabolic state. Growing evidence suggests the fat body is a critical regulator of complex behaviors, but little is known about the genes that function within the fat body to regulate sleep. To identify molecular factors functioning in the periphery to regulate sleep, we performed an RNAi screen selectively knocking down genes in the fat body. We found that knockdown of Phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase/Pfas(Ade2), a highly conserved gene involved the biosynthesis of purines, reduces sleep and energy stores. Flies heterozygous for multiple Ade2 mutations are also short sleepers and this effect is partially rescued by restoring Ade2 to the fat body. Targeted knockdown of Ade2 in the fat body does not alter arousal threshold or the homeostatic response to sleep deprivation, suggesting a specific role in modulating baseline sleep duration. Together, these findings suggest Ade2 functions within the fat body to promote both sleep and energy storage, providing a functional link between these processes.",

    "abstract": "Mutations and copy number variants of the Cub and Sushi Multiple Domains 2 (CSMD2) gene are associated with schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. CSMD2 is a single-pass transmembrane protein with a large extracellular domain comprising repeats of Cub and Sushi domains. Although the biological functions of CSMD2 have not been studied, the association between CSMD2 variants and cognitive function suggest that it may have a role in brain development or function. In this study, we show that mouse Csmd2 is expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the brain. Csmd2 protein exhibits a somatodendritic localization in the neocortex and hippocampus, with smaller puncta localizing further out in the neuropil. We show that many of these Csmd2 puncta co-localize with the synaptic protein PSD-95. Using immunohistochemical and biochemical methods, we further demonstrate that Csmd2 localizes to dendritic spines and is enriched in the postsynaptic density. We also find Csmd2 at ribbon synapses of the inner plexiform layer of the retina, suggesting a broader synaptic function of Csmd2 in the central nervous system. Finally, we show that the cytoplasmic tail domain of Csmd2 interacts with synaptic scaffolding proteins of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. The association between Csmd2 and MAGUK member PSD-95 is dependent on a PDZ-binding domain on the Csmd2 tail, which is also required for synaptic targeting of Csmd2. Together, these results point toward a function for Csmd2 in dendrites and synapses, which may account for its association with several psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "While there is ample evidence for localized mRNAs and protein synthesis in mature neuronal postsynaptic compartments, clear demonstrations of these processes in presynaptic terminals are extremely limited. Using expansion microscopy to resolve pre- and postsynaptic compartments we discovered that most presynaptic terminals contain mRNA and ribosomes. Using fluorescence-activated synaptosome sorting, we directly visualized or sequenced hundreds of mRNA species within excitatory boutons. Following brief metabolic labeling, over 30% of all presynaptic terminals exhibit a signal, providing evidence for ongoing protein synthesis. Using different classic plasticity paradigms, we discovered unique patterns of rapid pre- and/or postsynaptic translation. These data suggest that local protein synthesis in both pre- and postsynaptic elements is differentially recruited to drive the unique compartment-specific phenotypes that underlie different forms of plasticity.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryProtein synthesis occurs in all synaptic compartments, including excitatory and inhibitory axon terminals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA persons rate of aging has important implications for his/her risk of death and disease, thus, quantifying aging using observable characteristics has important applications for clinical, basic, and observational research. We aimed to validate a novel aging measure, \\\"Phenotypic Age\\\", constructed based on routine clinical chemistry measures, by assessing its applicability for differentiating risk for morbidity and mortality in both healthy and unhealthy populations of various ages.\\n\\nMethodsA nationally representative US sample, NHANES III, was used to derive \\\"Phenotypic Age\\\" based on a linear combination of chronological age and nine multi-system clinical chemistry measures, selected via cox proportional elastic net. Mortality predictions were validated using an independent sample (NHANES IV), consisting of 11,432 participants, for whom we observed a total of 871 deaths, ascertained over 12.6 year of follow-up. Proportional hazard models and ROC curves were used to evaluate predictions.\\n\\nResultsPhenotypic Age was significantly associated with all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality. These results were robust to age and sex stratification, and remained even when excluding short-term mortality. Similarly, Phenotypic Age was associated with mortality among seemingly \\\"healthy\\\" participants--defined as those who were disease-free and had normal BMI at baseline--as well as the oldest-old (aged 85+)--a group with high disease burden.\\n\\nConclusionsPhenotypic Age is a reliable predictor of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in multiple subgroups of the population. Risk stratification by this composite measure is far superior to that of the individual measures that go into it, as well as traditional measures of health. It is able to differentiate individuals who appear healthy, who may have otherwise been missed using traditional health assessments. Further, it can differentiate risk among persons with shared disease burden. Overall, this easily measured metric may be useful in the clinical setting and facilitate secondary and tertiary prevention strategies.",
