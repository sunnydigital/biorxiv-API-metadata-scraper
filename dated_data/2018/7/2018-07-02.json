    "abstract": "The readiness potential (RP)--a key ERP correlate of upcoming action--is known to precede subjects reports of their decision to move. Some view this as evidence against a causal role for consciousness in human decision-making and thus against free-will. Yet those studies focused on arbitrary decisions--purposeless, unreasoned, and without consequences. It remains unknown to what degree the RP generalizes to deliberate, more ecological decisions. We directly compared deliberate and arbitrary decision-making during a $1000-donation task to non-profit organizations. While we found the expected RPs for arbitrary decisions, they were strikingly absent for deliberate ones. Our results and drift-diffusion model are congruent with the RP representing accumulation of noisy, random fluctuations that drive arbitrary--but not deliberate--decisions. They further point to different neural mechanisms underlying deliberate and arbitrary decisions, challenging the generalizability of studies that argue for no causal role for consciousness in decision-making to real-life decisions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe extent of human free will has been debated for millennia. Previous studies demonstrated that neural precursors of action--especially the readiness potential--precede subjects reports of deciding to move. Some viewed this as evidence against free-will. However, these experiments focused on arbitrary decisions--e.g., randomly raising the left or right hand. We directly compared deliberate (actual $1000 donations to NPOs) and arbitrary decisions, and found readiness potentials before arbitrary decisions, but--critically--not before deliberate decisions. This supports the interpretation of readiness potentials as byproducts of accumulation of random fluctuations in arbitrary but not deliberate decisions and points to different neural mechanisms underlying deliberate and arbitrary choice. Hence, it challenges the generalizability of previous results from arbitrary to deliberate decisions.",

    "abstract": "The existence of population-wide T cell immunity is widely recognized for multiple pathogen-derived immunodominant epitopes, despite the vast diversity and individualized nature of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. We thus hypothesized that population-wide epitope immunogenicity could be probabilistically defined by exploiting public TCR features. To gain a proof-of-concept, here we describe a machine learning framework yielding probabilistic estimates of immunogenicity, termed \\\"immunogenicity scores\\\", by utilizing features designed to mimic thermodynamic interactions between peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and TCR repertoire. Immunogenicity score dynamics among observed and computationally simulated single amino acid mutants delineated the landscape of position- and residue-specific mutational impacts, and even quantitatively estimated escaping potentials of known epitopes with remarkable positional specificity. This study illustrates that the population-wide aspect of adaptive immunity is predictable via non-individualized approach, possibly indicating antigen-guided convergence of human T cell reactivity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTwo-sample summary data Mendelian randomization (MR) incorporating multiple genetic variants within a meta-analysis framework is a popular technique for assessing causality in epidemiology. If all genetic variants satisfy the instrumental variable (IV) and necessary modelling assumptions, then their individual ratio estimates of causal effect should be homogeneous. Observed heterogeneity signals that one or more of these assumptions could have been violated.\\n\\nMethodsCausal estimation and heterogeneity assessment in MR requires an approximation for the variance, or equivalently the inverse-variance weight, of each ratio estimate. We show that the most popular  1st order weights can lead to an inflation in the chances of detecting heterogeneity when in fact it is not present. Conversely, ostensibly more accurate  2nd order weights can dramatically increase the chances of failing to detect heterogeneity, when it is truly present. We derive modified weights to mitigate both of these adverse effects.\\n\\nResultsUsing Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the modified weights outperform 1st and 2nd order weights in terms of heterogeneity quantification. Modified weights are also shown to remove the phenomenon of regression dilution bias in MR estimates obtained from weak instruments, unlike those obtained using 1st and 2nd order weights. However, with small numbers of weak instruments, this comes at the cost of a reduction in estimate precision and power to detect a causal effect compared to 1st order weighting. Moreover, 1st order weights always furnish unbiased estimates and preserve the type I error rate under the causal null. We illustrate the utility of the new method using data from a recent two-sample summary data MR analysis to assess the causal role of systolic blood pressure on coronary heart disease risk.\\n\\nConclusionsWe propose the use of modified weights within two-sample summary data MR studies for accurately quantifying heterogeneity and detecting outliers in the presence of weak instruments. Modified weights also have an important role to play in terms of causal estimation (in tandem with 1st order weights) but further research is required to understand their strengths and weaknesses in specific settings.",

    "abstract": "Experimental studies of microbial communities routinely reveal that they have multiple stable states. While each of these states is generally resilient, certain perturbations such as antibiotics, probiotics and diet shifts, result in transitions to other states. Can we reliably both predict such stable states as well as direct and control transitions between them? Here we present a new conceptual model -- inspired by the stable marriage problem in game theory and economics -- in which microbial communities naturally exhibit multiple stable states, each state with a different species abundance profile. Our models core ingredient is that microbes utilize nutrients one at a time while competing with each other. Using only two ranked tables, one with microbes nutrient preferences and one with their competitive abilities, we can determine all possible stable states as well as predict inter-state transitions, triggered by the removal or addition of a specific nutrient or microbe. Further, using an example of 7 Bacteroides species common to the human gut utilizing 9 polysaccharides, we predict that mutual complementarity in nutrient preferences enables these species to coexist at high abundances.",

    "abstract": "Niche and fitness differences control the outcome of competition, but determining their relative importance in invaded communities - which may be far from equilibrium - remains a pressing concern. Moreover, it is unclear whether classic approaches for studying competition, which were developed predominantly for pairs of interacting species, will fully capture dynamics in complex species assemblages. We parameterized a population dynamic model using competition experiments of two native and three exotic species from a grassland community. We found evidence for minimal fitness differences or niche differences between the native species, leading to slow replacement dynamics and priority effects, but large fitness advantages allowed exotics to unconditionally invade natives. Priority effects driven by strong interspecific competition between exotic species drove single-species dominance by one of two exotic species in 80% of model outcomes, while a complex mixture of non-hierarchical competition and coexistence between native and exotic species occurred in the remaining 20%. Fungal infection, a commonly hypothesized coexistence mechanism, had weak fitness effects, and is unlikely to substantially affect coexistence. In contrast to previous work on pairwise outcomes in largely native-dominated communities, our work supports a role for nearly-neutral dynamics and priority effects as drivers of species composition in invaded communities.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYBy blocking an important signaling pathway (called NOTCH) and interfering with expression of two tumor suppressor genes in cells derived from human embryonic stem cells, the authors have developed a model for studying highly lethal small cell lung cancers.\\n\\nABSTRACTCell culture models based on directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) may reveal why certain constellations of genetic changes drive carcinogenesis in specialized human cell lineages. Here we demonstrate that up to 10 percent of lung progenitor cells derived from hESCs can be induced to form pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), the putative normal precursors to small cell lung cancers (SCLCs), by inhibition of NOTCH signaling. By using small inhibitory RNAs in these cultures to reduce levels of retinoblastoma (RB) protein, the product of a gene commonly mutated in SCLCs, we can significantly expand the number of PNECs. Similarly reducing levels of TP53 protein, the product of another tumor suppressor gene commonly mutated in SCLCs, or expressing mutant KRAS or EGFR genes, did not induce or expand PNECs, consistent with lineage-specific sensitivity to loss of RB function. Tumors resembling early stage SCLC grew in immunodeficient mice after subcutaneous injection of PNEC-containing cultures in which expression of both RB and TP53 was blocked. Single-cell RNA profiles of PNECs are heterogeneous; when RB levels are reduced, the profiles show similarities to RNA profiles from early stage SCLC; when both RB and TP53 levels are reduced, the transcriptome is enriched with cell cycle-specific RNAs. Taken together, these findings suggest that genetic manipulation of hESC-derived pulmonary cells will enable studies of the initiation, progression, and treatment of this recalcitrant cancer.",

    "abstract": "Background: Many neurodegenerative diseases are caused by nucleotide repeat expansions, but most expansions, like the C9orf72  GGGGCC (G4C2) repeat that causes approximately 5-7% of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases, are too long to sequence using short-read sequencing technologies. It is unclear whether long-read sequencing technologies can traverse these long, challenging repeat expansions. Here, we demonstrate that two long-read sequencing technologies, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), can sequence through disease-causing repeats cloned into plasmids, including the FTD/ALS-causing G4C2 repeat expansion. We also report the first long-read sequencing data characterizing the C9orf72 G4C2 repeat expansion at the nucleotide level in two symptomatic expansion carriers using PacBio whole-genome sequencing and a no-amplification (No-Amp) targeted approach based on CRISPR/Cas9.\\n\\nResults: Both the PacBio and ONT platforms successfully sequenced through the repeat expansions in plasmids. Throughput on the MinlON was a challenge for whole-genome sequencing; we were unable to attain reads covering the human C9orf72 repeat expansion using 15 flow cells. We obtained 8x coverage across the C9orf72 locus using the PacBio Sequel, accurately reporting the unexpanded allele at eight repeats, and reading through the entire expansion with 1324 repeats (7941 nucleotides). Using the No-Amp targeted approach, we attained >800x coverage and were able to identify the unexpanded allele, closely estimate expansion size, and assess nucleotide content in a single experiment. We estimate the individuals repeat region was >99% G4C2 content, though we cannot rule out small interruptions.\\n\\nConclusions: Our findings indicate that long-read sequencing is well suited to characterizing known repeat expansions, and for discovering new disease-causing, disease-modifying, or risk-modifying repeat expansions that have gone undetected with conventional short-read sequencing. The PacBio No-Amp targeted approach may have future potential in clinical and genetic counseling environments. Larger and deeper long-read sequencing studies in C9orf72 expansion carriers will be important to determine heterogeneity and whether the repeats are interrupted by non-G4C2 content, potentially mitigating or modifying disease course or age of onset, as interruptions are known to do in other repeat-expansion disorders. These results have broad implications across all diseases where the genetic etiology remains unclear.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional activation by p53 provides powerful, organism-wide tumor suppression. In this work, we demonstrate that the p53-induced transcriptome varies based on cell type, reflects cell type-specific activities, and is considerably more broad than previously anticipated. This behavior is strongly influenced by p53 engagement with differentially active cell type-specific enhancers and promoters. In epithelial cell types, p53 activity is dependent on the p53 family member p63, which displays widespread enhancer binding. Notably, we demonstrate that p63 is required for epithelial enhancer identity including enhancers used by p53 during stress-dependent signaling. Loss of p63, but not p53, leads to site-specific depletion of enhancer-associated chromatin modifications, suggesting that p63 functions as an enhancer maintenance factor in epithelial cells. Additionally, a subset of epithelial-specific enhancers is dependent on the activity of p63 providing a direct link between lineage determination and enhancer structure. These data suggest a broad, cell-intrinsic mechanism for regulating the p53-dependent cellular response to stress through differential regulation of cis-regulatory elements.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is known to store cognitive representations, or maps, that encode both positional and contextual information, critical for episodic memories and functional behavior. How path integration and contextual cues are dynamically combined and processed by the hippocampus to maintain these representations accurate over time remains unclear. To answer this question, we propose a two-way data analysis and modeling approach to CA3 multi-electrode recordings of a moving rat submitted to rapid changes of contextual (light) cues, triggering back-and-forth instabitilies between two cognitive representations (Jezek et al, Nature 478, p 246 (2011)). We develop a dual neural activity decoder, capable of independently identifying the recalled cognitive map at high temporal resolution (comparable to theta cycle) and the position of the rodent given a map. Remarkably, position can be reconstructed at any time with an accuracy comparable to fixed-context periods, even during highly unstable periods. These findings provide evidence for the capability of the hippocampal neural activity to maintain an accurate encoding of spatial and contextual variables, while one of these variables undergoes rapid changes independently of the other. To explain this result we introduce an attractor neural network model for the hippocampal activity that process inputs from external cues and the path integrator. Our model allows us to make predictions on the frequency of the cognitive map instability, its duration, and the detailed nature of the place-cell population activity, which are validated by a further analysis of the data. Our work therefore sheds light on the mechanisms by which the hippocampal network achieves and updates multi-dimensional neural representations from various input streams.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAs an animal moves in space and receives external sensory inputs, it must dynamically maintain the representations of its position and environment at all times. How the hippocampus, the brain area crucial for spatial representations, achieves this task, and manages possible conflicts between different inputs remains unclear. We propose here a comprehensive attractor neural network-based model of the hippocampus and of its multiple input streams (including self-motion). We show that this model is capable of maintaining faithful representations of positional and contextual information, and resolves conflicts by adapting internal representations to match external cues. Model predictions are confirmed by the detailed analysis of hippocampal recordings of a rat submitted to quickly varying and conflicting contextual inputs.",

We model an individually randomized vaccine trial by generating a network of individuals and simulating an epidemic. The disease natural history follows a Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Symptomatic or Infectious and Asymptomatic, Recovered model. We then use seven approaches to estimate VES, and we also estimate vaccine efficacy against progression to symptoms (VEP). A corrected relative risk and an interval censored Cox model accurately estimate VES and only require serologic testing of participants once, while a Cox model using only symptomatic infections returns biased estimates. Only acquiring serological endpoints in a 10% sample and imputing the remaining infection statuses yields unbiased VES estimates across values of R0 and accurate estimates of VEP for higher values.

We studied a zebrafish mutant for col11a2 and evaluated cartilage, bone development and mechanical properties to address this. We show that in col11a2 mutants Type II collagen is made but is prematurely degraded in maturing cartilage and ectopically expressed in the joint. These changes are correlated with increased stiffness of both bone and cartilage; quantified using Atomic Force Microscopy. In the mutants, the skeletal rudiment terminal region in the jaw joint are broader and the interzone smaller. These differences in shape and material properties impact on joint function and mechanical performance, which we modelled using Finite Element Analyses. Finally, we show that col11a2 heterozygous carriers reach adulthood but show signs of severe early onset osteoarthritis. Taken together our data demonstrate a key role for Type XI collagen in maintaining the properties of cartilage matrix; which when lost leads to alterations to cell behaviour that give rise to joint pathologies.",

    "abstract": "-helical coiled coils (CCs) represent an important, highly regular protein folding motif. To date, many thousands of CC structures have been determined experimentally. Their geometry is usually modelled by theoretical equations introduced by F. Crick that involve a predefined set of parameters. Here we have addressed the problem of efficient CC parameterization from scratch by performing a statistical evaluation of all available CC structures. The procedure is based on the principal component analysis and yields a minimal set of independent parameters that provide for the reconstruction of the complete CC structure at a required precision. The approach is successfully validated on a set of canonical parallel CC dimers. Its applications include all cases where an efficient sampling of the CC geometry is important, such as for solving the phase problem in crystallography.",

    "abstract": "One goal of the Natural Resource Conservation Services Sage-Grouse Initiative was to reverse the western US trend of declining sage-grouse populations. The sage-grouse initiative aims at preventing  sod-busting activities (conversion of native habitats into cropland) which is identified as the largest threat to stable sage-grouse populations and their habitats (USFWS 2010). Rest-rotation livestock grazing is implemented on sage-grouse  core areas with the purpose of improving rangeland health on private lands and eliminate the need of listing sage-grouse on the threatened or endangered species list. We collected arthropods in central Montana from three habitat classes associated with the Sage-grouse Initiative: 1) Grazed (actively grazed livestock pastures), 2) Deferred (Ungrazed pastures), and 3) Idle (Lands of the Lake Mason National Wildlife Refuge lower unit) and report here on 2012-2014 findings. Total arthropod catches in pitfall traps were greatest from livestock Idle pastures; however, greater numbers of those arthropods classified as sage-grouse food were caught from Deferred pastures. Differences in habitat class catches revolved primarily around the high levels of thatch found on the Lake Mason Wildlife Refuge which altered the community composition and predator:prey ratios.",

In particular, the creation of genome-wide libraries for CRISPR knockout (CRISPRko), CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) has allowed gene function to be systematically interrogated. Here, we evaluate numerous CRISPRko libraries and show that our recently-described CRISPRko library (Brunello) is more effective than previously published libraries at distinguishing essential and non-essential genes, providing approximately the same perturbation-level performance improvement over GeCKO libraries as GeCKO provided over RNAi. Additionally, we developed genome-wide libraries for CRISPRi (Dolcetto) and CRISPRa (Calabrese). Negative selection screens showed that Dolcetto substantially outperforms existing CRISPRi libraries with fewer sgRNAs per gene and achieves comparable performance to CRISPRko in the detection of gold-standard essential genes. We also conducted positive selection CRISPRa screens and show that Calabrese outperforms the SAM library approach at detecting vemurafenib resistance genes. We further compare CRISPRa to genome-scale libraries of open reading frames (ORFs). Together, these libraries represent a suite of genome-wide tools to efficiently interrogate gene function with multiple modalities.tracr",

    "abstract": "To understand the molecular differences between right-sided colon cancer (RCC), left-sided colon cancer (LCC) and rectal cancer, we analyzed colorectal tumors at the DNA, RNA, miRNA and protein levels using previously sequenced data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Clonal evolution analysis identified the same tumor-initiating events involving APC, KRAS and TP53 genes in RCC, LCC and rectal cancers. However, the individual role-played by each event, their order in tumor dynamics and selection of downstream mutations were distinct in all three anatomical locations, with some similarities noted between LCC and rectal cancer. We found a potentially targetable alteration APC R1450* specific to RCC that has not been previously described. Differential gene expression analysis revealed multiple genes within the homeobox, G-protein coupled receptor binding and transcription regulation families were dysregulated in RCC, LCC, and rectal cancers and may have a pathological role in these cancers. Further, using a novel in silico proteomic analytic tool developed by our research group, we found distinct central or hub proteins with unique interactomes in each location. Protein expression signatures were not necessarily concordant with the tumor profiles obtained at the DNA and RNA levels, underscoring the relevance of post-transcriptional events in defining the biology of these cancers beyond molecular changes at the DNA and/or RNA level. Ultimately, not only tumor location and the respective genomic profile but also protein-protein interactions will need to be taken into account to improve treatment outcomes of colorectal cancers. Further studies that take into account the alterations found in this study may help in developing more tailored, and perhaps more effective, treatment strategies.\\n\\nAuthor summaryPatients with right-sided colon cancer (RCC) has a worse prognosis compared to left-sided colon cancer (LCC). Recent data has also shown that wild-type RAS metastatic RCCs have poor outcomes when treated with the combination of chemotherapy and anti-EGFR therapy compared to LCC and rectal cancers. Therefore, There is an urgent unmet need to understand the molecular differences between RCC, LCC, and rectal cancers. In this study, we demonstrate clonal evolutionary trajectory and the order of mutations in RCC, LCC, and rectal cancers are distinct with some similarities between LCC and rectal cancers. The order of the mutations that lead to the acquisition of crucial driver alterations may have prognostic and therapeutic implications. We also discovered a novel targetable alteration, APC R1450* to be significantly enriched in early, late and metastatic RCC but not in LCC and rectal cancers. Amazingly, proteomic signatures were discordant with DNA and RNA levels. These distinct differences in DNA, RNA and post-transcriptional events may contribute to their unique clinicopathological features.\\n\\nConflict of Interest StatementAshiq Masood Advisory board and speaker Bureau Bristol-Myers Squibb and Boehringer Ingelheim\\n\\nJanakiraman Subramanian Advisory board - Astra Zeneca, Pfizer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Alexion, Paradigm, Bristol-Myers Squibb Speakers Bureau - Astra Zeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Lilly Research Support - Biocept and Paradigm\\n\\nArif Hussain Advisory board - Novartis, Bayer, Astra Zeneca Consultant - Bristol-Myers-Squibb All other authors have no conflict of interest.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSingle Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing has important and underutilized advantages that amplification-based platforms lack. Lack of systematic error (e.g. GC-bias), complete de novo assembly (including large repetitive regions) without scaffolding, can be mentioned. SMRT sequencing, however suffers from high random error rate and low sequencing depth (older chemistries). Here, we introduce PBHoover, software that uses a heuristic calling algorithm in order to make base calls with high certainty in low coverage regions. This software is also capable of mixed population detection with high sensitivity. PBHoovers CigarRoller attachment improves sequencing depth in low-coverage regions through CIGAR-string correction.\\n\\nResultsWe tested both modules on 348 M.tuberculosis clinical isolates sequenced on C1 or C2 chemistries. On average, CigarRoller improved percentage of usable read count from 68.9% to 99.98% in C1 runs and from 50% to 99% in C2 runs. Using the greater depth provided by CigarRoller, PBHoover was able to make base and variant calls 99.95% concordant with Sanger calls (QV33). PBHoover also detected antibiotic-resistant subpopulations that went undetected by Sanger. Using C1 chemistry, subpopulations as small as 9% of the total colony can be detected by PBHoover. This provides the most sensitive amplification-free molecular method for heterogeneity analysis and is in line with phenotypic methods sensitivity. This sensitivity significantly improves with the greater depth and lower error rate of the newer chemistries.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationExecutables are freely available under GNU GPL v3+ at http://www.gitlab.com/LPCDRP/pbhoover and http://www.gitlab.com/LPCDRP/CigarRoller.

    "abstract": "Although VPAC1 and its ligand vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are important in gastrointestinal physiology, their involvements in progression of gastrointestinal tumor have not been explored. Here, we found that higher expression of VIP/VPAC1 was observed in gastric cancer compared to the adjacent normal tissues. The increased expression of VIP/VPAC1 in gastric cancer correlated positively with invasion, tumor stage, lymph node, distant metastases, and poor survival. Moreover, high expression of VIP and VPAC1, advanced tumor stage and distant metastasis were independent prognostic factors. VPAC1 activation by VIP markedly induced TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ entry, and eventually promoted gastric cancer progression in a Ca2+ signaling-dependent manner. Inhibition of VPAC1 and its signaling pathway could block the progressive responses. VPAC1/TRPV4/Ca2+ signaling in turn enhanced the expression and secretion of VIP in gastric cancer cells, enforcing a positive feedback regulation mechanism. Taken together, our study demonstrate that VPAC1 is significantly overexpressed in gastric cancer and VPAC1/TRPV4/Ca2+ signaling axis could enforce a positive feedback regulation in gastric cancer progression. VIP/VPAC1 may serve as potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for gastric cancer.",

In mycology, there has long been the implicit assumption of trade-off between growth and enzymatic investment, which we here test. Using a set of 31 filamentous fungi isolated from the same ecosystem, we measured growth rate (as colony radial extension) and enzymatic repertoire (activities of four enzymes: laccase, cellobiohydrolase, leucine aminopeptidase and acid phosphatase). Our results support the existence of a trade-off, however only for the enzymes representing a larger metabolic cost (laccase and cellobiohydrolase). Our study offers new insights into functional complementarity within the soil fungal community in a number of ecosystem processes, and experimentally supports an enzymatic investment/ growth rate tradeoff in explaining phenomena including substrate succession.",

    "abstract": "Angle-closure glaucoma (ACG) is a severe form of glaucoma affecting up to 16 million people worldwide. In ACG, physical blockage of the ocular drainage tissue by the peripheral iris impedes the drainage of aqueous humor resulting in elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and subsequent optic nerve damage. Despite the high prevalence of ACG, the precise mechanism(s) underlying pathogenesis are only partially understood. We have previously demonstrated that a mutation in the gene encoding the serine protease PRSS56 causes an ACG phenotype in mice. Notably, Prss56 mutant mice exhibit a reduced ocular axial length and a lens occupying a larger ocular volume compared to WT mice, recapitulating characteristic features of human AGC. Our findings utilizing mouse genetic models demonstrate that loss of PRSS56 function results in altered configuration of ocular angle structures characterized by a posterior shift in the positioning of the ocular drainage tissue relative to the ciliary body and iris during development, leading to a physical blockage of drainage structure (angle closure) and high IOP. Utilizing a previously employed genetic strategy of rescuing mutant Prss56 mediated reduction in ocular size by inactivation of EGR1 (Egr1;Prss56 double mutants) we determined the influence of ocular size on developmental positioning of the ocular angle tissues. Our findings suggest that abnormal positioning of the drainage structure as a result of loss of PRSS56 function is uncoupled from its effect on ocular axial length reduction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the IOP elevation observed in Prss56 mutant mice is genetic context-dependent and identify a dominant modifier locus on Chromosome 2 of the C3H/HeJ genome conferring susceptibility to high IOP. Overall, our findings reveal a novel role for PRSS56 in the proper configuration of the iridocorneal angle and provide new insight into the developmental pathways implicated in glaucoma pathogenesis.",

DUP4 is a complex structural genomic variant that carries extra copies of a glycophorin A - glycophorin B fusion gene, and has a dramatic effect on malaria risk by reducing the risk of severe malaria by up to 40%. Using fiber-FISH and Illumina sequencing, we validate the structural arrangement of the glycophorin locus in the DUP4 variant, and reveal somatic variation in copy number of the glycophorin A-glycophorin B fusion gene. By developing a simple, specific, PCR-based assay for DUP4 we show the DUP4 variant reaches a frequency of 13% in a village in south-eastern Tanzania. We genotype a substantial proportion of that village and demonstrate an association of DUP4 genotype with hemoglobin levels, a phenotype related to malaria, using a family-based association test.

We develop a simple robust assay for this variant and demonstrate that DUP4 is at an appreciable population frequency in Tanzania and that it is associated with higher hemoglobin levels in a malaria-endemic village.

Chikungunya fever (CF) is a consolidated public health problem, in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, where control of CHIKV vector, mosquitos of the Aedes genus, failed. Since there is no vaccine or specific treatment against CHIKV, infected patients receive only palliative care to alleviate pain and arthralgia. Thus, drug repurposing is necessary to identify antivirals against CHIKV. Recently, the structure and activity of CHIKV RNA polymerase was partially resolved, revealing similar aspects with the enzyme counterparner on other positive sense RNA viruses, such as members of the Flaviviridae family. We then evaluated if sofosbuvir, clinically approved against hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase, which also aims to dengue, Zika and yellow fever viruses replication, would inhibit CHIKV replication. Indeed, sofosbuvir was 5-times more selective in inhibiting CHIKV production in human hepatoma cells than ribavirin, a pan-antiviral drug. Although CHIKV replication in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS)-derived astrocytes was less sensitive to sofosbuvirs, compared to hepatoma cells - this drug still impaired virus production and cell death in a MOI-dependent manner. Sofosbuvir also exhibited antiviral activity in vivo, by preventing CHIKV-induced paw oedeme in adult mice, at 20 mg/kg/day, and mortality on neonate mice model, at 40 and 80 mg/kg/day. Our data demonstrates that a prototypic alphavirus, CHIKV, is also susceptible to sofosbuvir. Since this is a clinically approved drug, it could pave the way to become a therapeutic option against CF.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder caused by loss of the protein dystrophin. In humans, DMD has early onset, causes developmental delays, muscle necrosis, loss of ambulation, and early death. Current animal models have been challenged by their inability to model the early onset and severity of the disease. Thus it remains unresolved if increased sarcoplasmic calcium observed in dystrophic muscles follows or leads the mechanical insults caused by the muscles disrupted contractile machinery. This knowledge has important applications for patients, as potential physiotherapeutic treatments may either help or exacerbate symptoms, depending on how dystrophic muscles differ from healthy ones. Recently we showed how burrowing dystrophic (dys-1) C. elegans recapitulate many salient phenotypes of DMD, including loss of mobility and muscle necrosis. Here we report dys-1 worms display early pathogenesis, including dysregulated sarcoplasmic calcium, and increased lethality. Sarcoplasmic calcium dysregulation in dys-1 worms precedes overt structural phenotypes (e.g. mitochondrial, and contractile machinery damage) and can be mitigated by silencing calmodulin expression. To learn how dystrophic musculature responds to altered physical activity, we cultivated dys-1 animals in environments requiring high amplitude, or high frequency of muscle exertion during locomotion. We find that several muscular parameters (such as size) improve with increased activity. However, longevity in dystrophic animals was negatively associated with muscular exertion, regardless of the duration of the effort. The high degree of phenotypic conservation between dystrophic worms and humans provides a unique opportunity to gain insights into the etiology of the disease, as well as the initial assessment of potential treatment strategies.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEDuchenne muscular dystrophy is a degenerative disease affecting tens of thousands of people in the US alone. Much remains unknown about the disease, including the chain of events that links the loss of dystrophin to muscle death, or the extent to which exercise might be able to protect degenerating muscles. We used the nematode C. elegans to show that sarcoplasmic calcium dysregulation takes place in dystrophic muscles long before other overt signs of damage manifest. When placed in assays that altered muscular activity by increasing either contraction frequency or amplitude, we observed several metrics associated with muscular repair increase. However, no treatment positively affected the life expectancy of dystrophic animals.",

    "abstract": "Visual cortex plasticity is high during a critical period of early postnatal development, but rapidly diminishes with the transition to adulthood. Accordingly, visual disorders such as amblyopia (lazy eye), can be treated early in life by long-term occlusion of the non-amblyopic eye, but may become irreversible in adults, because of the decline in brain plasticity. Here we show that a novel counter-intuitive approach can promote the recovery of visual function in adult amblyopic patients: short-term occlusion of the amblyopic (not the fellow) eye, combined with physical exercise (cycling). After six brief (2h) training sessions, visual acuity improved in all ten patients (0.15{+/-}0.02 LogMar), and six of them also recovered stereopsis. The improvement was preserved for up to one year after training. A control experiment revealed that physical activity was crucial for the recovery of visual acuity and stereopsis. Thus, we propose a non-invasive therapeutic strategy for adult human amblyopia based an inverse-occlusion and physical exercise procedure.",

    "abstract": "A network consisting of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons is a canonical model for understanding cortical network activity. In this study, we extend the EI network model and investigate how its dynamical landscape can be enriched when it interacts with another excitatory (E) population with transmission delays. Through analysis and simulations of a rate model and a spiking network model, we study the transition from stationary to oscillatory states by analyzing the Hopf bifurcation structure in terms of two network parameters: 1) transmission delay between the EI subnetwork and the E population and 2) inhibitory couplings that induce oscillatory activity in the EI subnetwork. We find that the critical coupling strength can strongly modulate as a function of transmission delay, and consequently the stationary state is interwoven intricately with oscillatory states generating different frequency modes. This leads to the emergence of an isolated stationary state surrounded by multiple oscillatory states and cross-frequency coupling develops at the bifurcation points. We identify the possible network motifs that induce oscillations and examine how multiple oscillatory states come together to enrich the dynamical landscape.",

    "abstract": "Urochloa decumbens (Stapf) R.D. Webster is one of the most important African forage grasses in Brazilian beef production. Currently available genetic-genomic resources for this species are restricted mainly due to polyploidy and apomixis. Therefore, crucial genomic-molecular studies such as the construction of genetic maps and the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are very challenging and consequently affect the advancement of molecular breeding. The objectives of this work were to (i) construct an integrated U. decumbens genetic map for a full-sibling progeny using GBS-based markers with allele dosage information, (ii) detect QTLs for spittlebug (Notozulia entreriana) resistance, and (iii) seek putative candidate genes involved in resistance/defense against pathogens. We used the Setaria viridis genome as reference to align GBS reads and selected 4,240 high-quality SNPs markers with allele dosage information. Of these markers, 1,000 were distributed throughout nine homologous groups with a cumulative map length of 1,335.09 cM and an average marker density of 1.33 cM. We detected QTLs for resistance to spittlebug, an important pasture insect pest, that explained between 4.66% and 6.24% of the phenotypic variation. These QTLs are in regions containing putative candidate genes related to resistance/defense against pathogens. Because this is the first genetic map with SNP autotetraploid dosage data and QTL detection in U. decumbens, it will be useful for future evolutionary studies, genome assembly, and other QTL analyses in Urochloa spp. Moreover, the results might facilitate the isolation of spittlebug-related candidate genes and help clarify the mechanism of spittlebug resistance. These approaches will improve selection efficiency and accuracy in U. decumbens molecular breeding and shorten the breeding cycle.",

From the 17,354 expressed genes, 1,317 were prioritized by five selection categories (differentially expressed, harbouring SNPs associated with FE, tissue-specific, secreted in plasma and key regulators) and used for network construction. NR2F6 and TGFB were identified and validated by motif discovery as key regulators of hepatic inflammatory response and muscle tissue development, respectively, two biological processes demonstrated to be associated to FE. Moreover, we indicated potential biomarkers of FE which are related to hormonal control of metabolism and sexual maturity.

    "abstract": "Failure to make adaptive immune responses is a hallmark of aging. In particular reduced B cell function leads to poor vaccination efficacy and a high prevalence of infections in the elderly. However, the molecular mechanism underlying immune senescence is largely unknown. Here we show that autophagy levels are specifically reduced in mature lymphoid cells, leading to compromised memory B cell responses in old individuals. Spermidine, a naturally occurring polyamine metabolite, induces autophagy in vivo and rejuvenates memory B cell responses in an autophagy-dependent manner. Mechanistically, spermidine post-translationally modifies the translation factor eIF5A, which assists the synthesis of TFEB, a key transcription factor of autophagy. Spermidine is depleted in the elderly, leading to reduced TFEB expression and autophagy. Replenishing spermidine restored this pathway and improved the responses of old human B cells. Taken together, our results reveal an unexpected autophagy regulatory mechanism mediated by eIF5A at the translational level, and this pathway can be harnessed to rejuvenate immune senescence in humans.",

Despite the intensive studies conducted on this bacterium, most of the information available are related to its pathogenic characteristics, with only a limited number of publications mentioning its ability to survive in extreme environments. Recently, a B. thuringiensis MCMY1 strain was successfully isolated from a copper contaminated site in Mamut Copper Mine, Sabah. This study aimed to conduct a comparative genomic analysis by using the genome sequence of MCMY1 strain published in GenBank (PRJNA374601) as a target genome for comparison with other available B. thuringiensis genomes at the GenBank. Whole genome alignment, Fragment all-against-all comparison analysis, phylogenetic reconstruction and specific copper genes comparison were applied to all forty-five B. thuringiensis genomes to reveal the molecular adaptation to copper tolerance. The comparative results indicated that B. thuringiensis MCMY1 strain is closely related to strain Bt407 and strain IS5056. This strain harbors almost all available copper genes annotated from the forty-five B. thuringiensis genomes, except for the gene for Magnesium and cobalt efflux protein (CorC) which plays an indirect role in reducing the oxidative stress that caused by copper and other metal ions. Furthermore, the findings also showed that the Copper resistance gene family, CopABCDZ and its repressor (CsoR) are conserved in almost all sequenced genomes but the presence of the genes for Cytoplasmic copper homeostasis protein (CutC) and CorC across the sample genomes are highly inconsonant. The variation of these genes across the B. thuringiensis genomes suggests that each strain may have adapted to their specific ecological niche. However, further investigations will be need to support this preliminary hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMechanisms of programmed cell death differ considerably between animals, plants and fungi. In animals they depend on caspases and Bcl-2 family proteins and this kind of cell death is called apoptosis. Most gene families encoding proteins involved in apoptosis are found in multicellular animals already in the eldest phyla but their functional conservation is still being studied. Much older protein families have cytoprotective functions across all kingdoms of life. This includes the TMBIMP-family, the presence and function of which in early metazoans has not been investigated yet.\\n\\nMethodsWe quantified apoptosis in transgenic Hydra overexpressing HyBcl-2-like 4. Moreover, we investigated putative TMBIMP-family members in Hydra by sequence comparison. By overexpression of TMBIMP-family members in Hydra and human HEK cells we analysed their subcellular localisation and in one case their capacity to protect cells from camptothecin induced apoptosis.\\n\\nResultsHyBcl-2-like 4, as previously shown in a heterologous system, was localised to mitochondria and able to protect Hydra epithelial cells from apoptosis. The TMBIMP-family in Hydra includes HyBax-Inhibitor-1, HyLifeguard-1a and -1b and HyLifeguard 4 proteins. HyBax-inhibitor-1 protein was found localised to ER-membranes, HyLifeguard-family members were found at the plasma membrane and in Golgi-vesicles. Moreover, HyBax-inhibitor-1 protected human cells from apoptosis.\\n\\nConclusionThis work provides the first functional study to support an anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2 like proteins in pre-bilaterians within a physiological context. Furthermore it illustrates that genes that were \\\"inherited\\\" from non-animal ancestors, like the TMBIMP-family, were recruited to carry out cell protective anti-apoptotic functions already in early metazoans.",

    "abstract": "The skills required to understand genetic phenomena and transfer knowledge to real world situations are an important part of 21st century scientific literacy. While socio-scientific issues (SSI) are increasingly emphasised in science curricula, teachers have low interest in adopting SSI in teaching. Little is known about how teachers choose content for their teaching, although this process translates curricula to teaching practice. We explored how teachers choose content and contexts for biology courses on cells, heredity, and biotechnology by interviewing ten Finnish upper-secondary school teachers. We studied how the teachers described teaching on genetically modified organisms, hereditary disorders, and human traits. Teachers perceptions on genetics teaching were classified to Developmental, Structural and Hereditary approaches. The approaches were connected not only to the teachers perceptions of the more important content, but also teacher inclinations towards teaching genetics in the human context and perceptions of students interest in different topics. Teachers justified their choices by national, local school, and teachers personal-level factors. While teachers mentioned that SSI are important, they were never mentioned among the important contexts. Nevertheless, some teachers embraced teaching genetics in the human context while others avoided them. Teachers justified their avoidance for personal and pedagogical factors, such as their competence in dealing with these contexts. Experience played a part in the approach that teachers had, and contrary to the results of previous research, the less experienced teachers were more open to discussing human genetics. We conclude that curriculum development is important to encourage teachers to adopt more SSI-oriented teaching.\n\nDisclosure statementTuomas Aivelo has participated in writing biology textbooks for upper-secondary school biology for eOppi Oy.

    "abstract": "Populations that have recently diverged across sharp environmental gradients provide an opportunity to study the mechanisms by which natural selection drives adaptive divergence. Inland and coastal populations of the North American swamp sparrow have become an emerging model system for studies of natural selection because they are morphologically and behaviourally distinct despite a very recent divergence time (<15,000 years), yet common garden experiments have demonstrated a genetic basis for their phenotypic differences. We characterized genomic patterns of variation within and between inland and coastal swamp sparrows via reduced representation sequencing in order to reconstruct the contributions of demography, gene flow and selection to this case of recent adaptive divergence. Compared to inland swamp sparrows, coastal swamp sparrows exhibited fewer polymorphic sites and reduced nucleotide diversity at those sites, indicating that a bottleneck and/or recent selective sweeps occurred in that population during coastal colonization and local adaptation. Estimates of genome-wide differentiation (FST=0.02) and sequence divergence ({Phi}ST=0.05) between inland and coastal populations were very low, consistent with postglacial divergence. A small number of SNPs were strongly differentiated (max FST=0.8) suggesting selection at linked sites. Swamp sparrows sampled from breeding sites at the habitat transition between freshwater and brackish marshes exhibited high levels of genetic admixture. Such evidence of active contemporary gene flow makes the evolution and maintenance of local adaptation in these two populations even more notable. We summarize several features of the swamp sparrow system that may facilitate the maintenance of adaptive diversity despite gene flow, including the presence of a magic trait.",

    "abstract": "The term microbiome describes the genetic material encoding the various microbial populations that inhabit our body. Whilst colonisation of various body niches (e.g. the gut) by dynamic communities of microorganisms is now universally accepted, the existence of microbial populations in other \\\"classically sterile\\\" locations, including the blood, is a relatively new concept. The presence of bacteria-specific DNA in the blood has been reported in the literature for some time, yet the true origin of this is still the subject of much deliberation. The aim of this study was to investigate the phenomenon of a \\\"blood microbiome\\\" by providing a comprehensive description of bacterially-derived nucleic acids using a range of complementary molecular and classical microbiological techniques. For this purpose we utilised a set of plasma samples from healthy subjects (n = 5) and asthmatic subjects (n = 5). DNA-level analyses involved the amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. RNA-level analyses were based upon the de novo assembly of unmapped mRNA reads and subsequent taxonomic identification. Molecular studies were complemented by viability data from classical aerobic and anaerobic microbial culture experiments. At the phylum level, the blood microbiome was predominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The key phyla detected were consistent irrespective of molecular method (DNA vs RNA), and consistent with the results of other published studies. In silico comparison of our data with that of the Human Microbiome Project revealed that members of the blood microbiome were most likely to have originated from the oral or skin communities. To our surprise, aerobic and anaerobic cultures were positive in eight of out the ten donor samples investigated, and we reflect upon their source. Our data provide further evidence of a core blood microbiome, and provide insight into the potential source of the bacterial DNA / RNA detected in the blood. Further, data reveal the importance of robust experimental procedures, and identify areas for future consideration.",

Here, we obtained single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach and then employed the SNPs for the following objectives: (i) to identify the positions of SNPs on a genetic map of a segregating mapping population, (ii) to evaluate the population structure of a germplasm collection, and (iii) to detect patterns of LD decay among chromosomes for future genetic association studies in rubber tree. A total of 626 genotypes, including both germplasm accessions (368) and individuals from a genetic mapping population (254), were genotyped. A total of 77,660 and 21,283 SNPs were detected by GBS in the germplasm and mapping populations, respectively. The mapping population, which was previously mapped, was constructed with 1,062 markers, among which only 576 SNPs came from GBS, reducing the average interval between two adjacent markers to 4.4 cM. SNPs from GBS genotyping were used for the analysis of genetic structure and LD estimation in the germplasm accessions. Two groups, which largely corresponded to the cultivated and wild populations, were detected using STRUCTURE and via principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). LD analysis, also using the mapped SNPs, revealed that non-random associations varied along chromosomes, with regions of high LD interspersed with regions of low LD. Considering the length of the genetic map (4,693 cM) and the mean LD (0.49 for cultivated and 0.02 for wild populations), a large number of evenly spaced SNPs would be needed to perform genome-wide association studies in rubber tree, and the wilder the genotypes used, the more difficult the mapping saturation.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection acts on functional molecular variation to create local adaptation, the \\\"good fit\\\" we observe between an organisms phenotype and its environment. Genomic comparisons of lineages in the earliest stages of adaptive divergence have high power to reveal genes under natural selection because molecular signatures of selection on functional loci are maximally detectable when overall genomic divergence is low. We conducted a scan for local adaptation genes in the North American swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana), a species that includes geographically connected populations that are differentially adapted to freshwater vs. brackish tidal marshes. The brackish tidal marsh form has rapidly evolved tolerance for salinity, a deeper bill, and darker plumage since colonizing coastal habitats within the last 15,000 years. Despite their phenotypic differences, background genomic divergence between these populations is very low, rendering signatures of natural selection associated with this recent coastal adaptation highly detectable. We recovered a multigenic snapshot of ecological selection via a whole genome scan that revealed robust signatures of selection at 31 genes with functional connections to bill shape, plumage melanism and salt tolerance. As in Darwins finches, BMP signaling appears responsible for changes in bill depth, a putative magic trait for ecological speciation. A signal of selection at BNC2, a melanocyte transcription factor responsible for human skin color saturation, implicates a shared genetic mechanism for sparrow plumage color and human skin tone. Genes for salinity tolerance constituted the majority of adaptive candidates identified in this genome scan (23/31) and included vasoconstriction hormones that can flexibly modify osmotic balance in tune with the tidal cycle by influencing both drinking behavior and kidney physiology. Other salt tolerance genes had potential pleiotropic effects on bill depth and melanism (6/31), offering a mechanistic explanation for why these traits have evolved together in coastal swamp sparrows, and in other organisms that have converged on the same \\\"salt marsh syndrome\\\". As a set, these candidates capture the suite of physiological changes that coastal swamp sparrows have evolved in response to selection pressures exerted by a novel and challenging habitat.",

    "abstract": "Models of basal ganglia function predict that tonic inhibitory output to motor thalamus suppresses unwanted movements, and that a decrease in such activity leads to action selection. A direct test of these outcomes of thalamic inhibition has not been performed, however. To conduct such a direct test, we utilized rapid optogenetic activation and inactivation of the GABAergic output of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) to motor thalamus in mice that were trained in a sensory cued left/right licking task. Directional licking tasks have previously been shown to depend on a thalamocortical feedback loop between ventromedial motor thalamus and antero-lateral premotor cortex (Li et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2017). In confirmation of model predictions, we found that 1s of unilateral optogenetic inhibition of GABAergic output from the SNr biased decision making towards the contralateral lick spout with ipsilaterally cued trials while leaving motor performance intact. In contrast, 1s of optogenetic excitation of SNr terminals in motor thalamus resulted in an opposite bias towards the ipsilateral direction confirming a bidirectional effect of tonic nigral output on directional decision making. In a second variant of the task we disallowed anticipatory licking and found that successful suppression of anticipatory licking was also impacted by our optogenetic manipulations in agreement with the suppressive effect of tonic nigral output. Nevertheless, direct unilateral excitation of SNr cell bodies resulted in bilateral movement suppression, suggesting that descending motor pathways from the SNr to superior colliculus also play an important role in the control of licking behavior.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThis study provides the first evidence that basal ganglia output to motor thalamus can control decision making in left/right licking choices and suppress anticipatory movement initiation. Unilateral optogenetic inhibition or excitation of basal ganglia output via the substantia nigra resulted in opposite changes of directional lick choices and could override the sensory information on lick direction provided by a whisker stimulus. These results suggest that basal ganglia output gates activity in a thalamo-cortical feedback loop previously shown to underlie the control of forced choice directional licking behavior. The results substantiate models stating that tonic inhibition of motor thalamus from the basal ganglia directs action selection and suppresses unwanted movements.",

    "abstract": "Reassortment in viruses with segmented genome is a major evolutionary process for their genetic diversity and adaptation. It is also crucial in generating different levels of sequence polymorphism among segments when positive selection occurs at different rates on them. Previous studies have detected intra-subtype reassortment events in human influenza H3N2 by between-segment incongruity in phylogenetic tree topology. Here, we quantitatively estimate the reassortment rate, probability that a pair of segments in a viral lineage become separated in a unit time, between hemmaglutinin (HA) and four non-antigenic segments (PB2, PB1, PA and NP) in human influenza virus H3N2. Using statistics that measure incongruity in tree topology or linkage disequilibrium between segments and performing simulations that are constrained to reproduce the various patterns of H3N2 molecular evolution, we infer that reassortment rate ranges between 0.001 and 0.01 assuming one generation to be 1/80 year. However, we find that a higher rate of reassortment is required to generate the observed pattern of ~40% less synonymous sequence polymorphism on HA relative to other non-HA segments, which results from recurrent selective sweeps by antigenic variants on the HA segment. Here, synonymous diversity was compared after correcting for difference in inferred mutation rates among segments, which we found significant. We also explored analytic approximations for inter-segmental difference in sequence diversity for a given reassortment rate to understand the underlying dynamics of recurrent positive selection. It is suggested that the effects of clonal interference and potentially demography-dependent rate of reassortment in the process of recurrent selective sweeps must be considered to fully explain the genomic pattern of diversity in H3N2 viruses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundsPyricularia is a multispecies complex that could infect and cause severe blast disease on diverse hosts, including rice, wheat and many other grasses. Although the genome size of this fungal complex is small [~40 Mbp for Pyricularia oryzae (syn. Magnaporthe oryzae), and ~45 Mbp for P. grisea], the genome plasticity allows the fungus to jump and adapt to new hosts. Therefore, deciphering the genome basis of individual species could facilitate the evolutionary and genetic study of this fungus. However, except for the P. oryzae subgroup, many other species isolated from diverse hosts, such as the Pennisetum grasses, remain largely uncovered genetically.\\n\\nResultsHere, we report the genome sequence of a pyriform-shaped fungal strain P. penniseti P1609 isolated from a Pennisetum grass (JUJUNCAO) using PacBio SMRT sequencing technology. We performed a phylogenomic analysis of 28 Magnaporthales species and 5 non-Magnaporthales species and addressed P1609 into a Pyricularia subclade that is distant from P. oryzae. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the pathogenicity-related gene repertoires were fairly different between P1609 and the P. oryzae strain 70-15, including the cloned avirulence genes, other putative secreted proteins, as well as some other predicted Pathogen-Host Interaction (PHI) genes. Genomic sequence comparison also identified many genomic rearrangements.\\n\\nConclusionTaken together, our results suggested that the genomic sequence of the P. penniseti P1609 could be a useful resource for the genetic study of the Pennisetum-infecting Pyricularia species.",

    "abstract": "During land plant evolution, determinate spore-bearing axes (retained in extant bryophytes such as mosses) were progressively transformed into indeterminate branching shoots with specialized reproductive axes that form flowers. The LEAFY transcription factor, which is required for the first zygotic cell division in mosses and primarily for floral meristem identity in flowering plants, may have facilitated developmental innovations during these transitions. Mapping the LEAFY evolutionary trajectory has been challenging, however, because there is no functional overlap between mosses and flowering plants, and no functional data from intervening lineages. Here, we report a transgenic analysis in the fern Ceratopteris richardii that reveals a role for LEAFY in maintaining cell divisions in the apical stem cells of both haploid and diploid phases of the lifecycle. These results support an evolutionary trajectory in which an ancestral LEAFY module that promotes cell proliferation was progressively co-opted, adapted and specialized as novel shoot developmental contexts emerged.",

We tested this approach by targeting omega-1 ({omega}1) of Schistosoma mansoni as a proof of principle. This secreted ribonuclease is crucial for Th2 priming and granuloma formation, providing informative immuno-pathological readouts for programmed genome editing. Schistosome eggs were either exposed to Cas9 complexed with a synthetic guide RNA (sgRNA) complementary to exon 6 of {omega}1 by electroporation or transduced with pseudotyped lentivirus encoding Cas9 and the sgRNA. Some eggs were also transduced with a single stranded oligodeoxynucleotide donor transgene that encoded six stop codons, flanked by 50 nt-long 5-and 3-microhomology arms matching the predicted Cas9-catalyzed double stranded break (DSB) within {omega}1. CRISPResso analysis of amplicons spanning the DSB revealed [~]4.5% of the reads were mutated by insertions, deletions and/or substitutions, with an efficiency for homology directed repair of 0.19% insertion of the donor transgene. Transcripts encoding {omega}1 were reduced >80% and lysates of {omega}1-edited eggs displayed diminished ribonuclease activity indicative that programmed editing mutated the {omega}1 gene. Whereas lysates of wild type eggs polarized Th2 cytokine responses including IL-4 and IL-5 in human macrophage/T cell co-cultures, diminished levels of the cytokines followed the exposure to lysates of {omega}1-mutated schistosome eggs. Following injection of schistosome eggs into the tail vein of mice, the volume of pulmonary granulomas surrounding {omega}1-mutated eggs was 18-fold smaller than wild type eggs. Programmed genome editing was active in schistosomes, Cas9-catalyzed chromosomal breakage was repaired by homology directed repair and/or non-homologous end joining, and mutation of {omega}1 impeded the capacity of schistosome eggs both to drive Th2 polarization and to provoke formation of pulmonary circumoval granulomas. Knock-out of {omega}1 and the impaired immunological phenotype showcase the novel application of programmed gene editing in and functional genomics for schistosomes.",
