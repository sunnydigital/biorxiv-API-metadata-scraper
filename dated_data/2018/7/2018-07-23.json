    "abstract": "Linear mixed effect models are powerful tools used to account for population structure in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and estimate the genetic architecture of complex traits. However, fully-specified models are computationally demanding and common simplifications often lead to reduced power or biased inference. We describe Grid-LMM (https://github.com/deruncie/GridLMM), an extendable algorithm for repeatedly fitting complex linear models that account for multiple sources of heterogeneity, such as additive and non-additive genetic variance, spatial heterogeneity, and genotype-environment interactions. Grid-LMM can compute approximate (yet highly accurate) frequentist test statistics or Bayesian posterior summaries at a genome-wide scale in a fraction of the time compared to existing general-purpose methods. We apply Grid-LMM to two types of quantitative genetic analyses. The first is focused on accounting for spatial variability and non-additive genetic variance while scanning for QTL; and the second aims to identify gene expression traits affected by non-additive genetic variation. In both cases, modeling multiple sources of heterogeneity leads to new discoveries.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe goal of quantitative genetics is to characterize the relationship between genetic variation and variation in quantitative traits such as height, productivity, or disease susceptibility. A statistical method known as the linear mixed effect model has been critical to the development of quantitative genetics. First applied to animal breeding, this model now forms the basis of a wide-range of modern genomic analyses including genome-wide associations, polygenic modeling, and genomic prediction. The same model is also widely used in ecology, evolutionary genetics, social sciences, and many other fields. Mixed models are frequently multi-faceted, which is necessary for accurately modeling data that is generated from complex experimental designs. However, most genomic applications use only the simplest form of linear mixed methods because the computational demands for model fitting can be too great. We develop a flexible approach for fitting linear mixed models to genome scale data that greatly reduces their computational burden and provides flexibility for users to choose the best statistical paradigm for their data analysis. We demonstrate improved accuracy for genetic association tests, increased power to discover causal genetic variants, and the ability to provide accurate summaries of model uncertainty using both simulated and real data examples.",

    "abstract": "One of the biggest bottlenecks for structural analysis of proteins remains the creation of high yield and high purity samples of the target protein. Cell-free protein synthesis technologies are powerful and customizable platforms for obtaining functional proteins of interest in short timeframes while avoiding potential toxicity issues and permitting high-throughput screening. These methods have benefited many areas of genomic and proteomics research, therapeutics, vaccine development and protein chip constructions. In this work, we demonstrate a versatile and multistage eukaryotic wheat-germ cell-free protein expression pipeline to generate functional proteins of different sizes from multiple host organism and DNA source origins. We also developed a robust purification procedure, which can produce highly-pure (>98%) proteins with no specialized equipment required and minimal time invested. This pipeline successfully produced and analyzed proteins in all three major geometry formats used for structural biology including single particle analysis, and both two-dimensional and three-dimensional protein crystallography. The flexibility of the wheat germ system in combination with the multiscale pipeline described here provides a new workflow for rapid generation of samples for structural characterization that may not be amenable to other recombinant approaches.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) is an effective approach for detecting vertebrates and plants, especially in aquatic ecosystems, but prior studies have largely examined eDNA in cool temperate settings. By contrast, this study employs eDNA to survey the fish fauna in tropical Lake Bacalar (Mexico) with the additional goal of assessing the possible presence of invasive fishes, such as Amazon sailfin catfish. Sediment and water samples were collected from eight stations in Lake Bacalar on three occasions over a 4-month interval. Each sample was stored in the presence or absence of lysis buffer to compare eDNA recovery. Short fragments (184-187 bp) of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene were amplified using fusion primers and then sequenced on Ion Torrent PGM and S5 before their source species were determined using a custom reference sequence database constructed on BOLD. In total, eDNA sequences were recovered from 75 species of vertebrates including 47 fishes, 15 birds, 7 mammals, 5 reptiles, and 1 amphibian. Although all species are known from this region, 6 fish species represent new records for the study area, while 2 require verification. Sequences for five species (2 birds, 2 mammals, 1 reptile) were only detected from sediments, while sequences from 52 species were only recovered from water. Because DNA from the Amazon sailfin catfish was not detected, we used a mock eDNA experiment to confirm our methods were appropriate for its detection. We developed protocols that enabled the recovery of eDNA from tropical oligotrophic aquatic ecosystems, and confirmed their effectiveness in detecting diverse species of vertebrates including an invasive species of Amazon catfish.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been increased attention on the non-trivial role that genotype-phenotype maps play in the course of evolution, where natural selection acts on phenotypes, but variation arises at the level of mutations. Understanding such mappings is arguably the next missing piece in a fully predictive theory of evolution. Although there are theoretical descriptions of such mappings for the monomorphic (N << 1) and deterministic or very strong mutation (N [&gt;&gt;&gt;] 1) limit, given by developments of Iwasas free fitness and quasispecies theories, respectively, there is no general description for the intermediate regime where N ~ 1. In this paper, we address this by transforming Wrights well-known stationary distribution of genotypes under selection and mutation to give the probability distribution of phenotypes, assuming a general genotype-phenotype map. The resultant distribution shows that the degeneracies of each phenotype appear by weighting the mutation term; this gives rise to a bias towards phenotypes of larger degeneracy analogous to quasispecies theory, but at finite population size. On the other hand we show that as population size is decreased, again phenotypes of higher degeneracy are favoured, which is a finite mutation description of the effect of sequence entropy in the monomorphic limit. We also for the first time (to the authors knowledge) provide an explicit derivation of Wrights stationary distribution of the frequencies of multiple alleles.",

Although intrinsic mechanisms controlling DC death have not been fully characterized up to now, experimentally enforced inhibition of DC-death causes various autoimmune diseases in model systems. We have generated mice deficient for Protein Phosphatase with EF-Hands 2 (Ppef2), which is selectively expressed in CD8+ DCs, but not in other related DC subtypes such as tissue CD103+ DCs. Ppef2 is down-regulated rapidly upon maturation of DCs by toll-like receptor stimuli, but not upon triggering of CD40. Ppef2-deficient CD8+ DCs accumulate the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-like protein 11 (Bim) and show increased apoptosis and reduced competitve repopulation capacities. Furthermore, Ppef2-/-CD8+ DCs have strongly diminished antigen presentation capacities in vivo, as CD8+ T cells primed by Ppef2-/- CD8+ DCs undergo reduced expansion. In conclusion, our data suggests that Ppef2 is crucial to support survival of immature CD8+ DCs, while Ppef2 down-regulation during DC-maturation limits T cell responses.",

    "abstract": "Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) are cation channels that mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores in response to a wide range of cellular stimuli. The paradigm of InsP3R activation is the coupled interplay between binding of InsP3 and Ca2+ that switches the ion conduction pathway between closed and open states to enable the passage of Ca2+ through the channel. However, the molecular mechanism of how the receptor senses and decodes ligand-binding signals into gating motion remains unknown. Here we present the electron cryo-microscopy structure of InsP3R1 from rat cerebellum determined to 4.1 [A] resolution in the presence of activating concentrations of Ca2+ and adenophostin A (AdA), a structural mimetic of InsP3 and the most potent known agonist of the channel. Comparison with the 3.9 [A]-resolution structure of InsP3R1 in the Apo-state, also reported herein, reveals the binding arrangement of AdA in the tetrameric channel assembly and striking ligand-induced conformational rearrangements within cytoplasmic domains coupled to the dilation of a hydrophobic constriction at the gate. Together, our results provide critical insights into the mechanistic principles by which ligand-binding allosterically gates InsP3R channel.",

Using a gene set scoring method to investigate RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) we show that patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma have an improved survival rate if their tumor shows evidence of greater NK cell infiltration. Furthermore, these survival effects are enhanced in tumors which have a higher expression of NK cell stimuli such as IL-15, suggesting NK cells are part of a coordinated immune response within these patients. Using this signature we then examine transcriptomic data to identify tumor and stromal components which may influence the penetrance of NK cells into solid tumors.\\n\\nThese data support a role for NK cells in the regulation of human tumors and highlight potential survival effects associated with increased NK cell activity.

    "abstract": "Brain function has been investigated via the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) effect using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the past decades. Advances in sodium imaging offer the unique chance to access signal changes directly linked to sodium ions (23Na) flux across the cell membrane, which generates action potentials, hence signal transmission in the brain. During this process 23Na transiently accumulates in the intracellular space. Here we show that quantitative functional sodium imaging (fNaI) at 3T is potentially sensitive to 23Na concentration changes during finger tapping, which can be quantified in grey and white matter regions key to motor function. For the first time, we measured a 23Na concentration change of 0.54 mmol/l in the ipsilateral cerebellum, 0.46 mmol/l in the contralateral primary motor cortex, 0.27 mmol/l in the corpus callosum and -11 mmol/l in the ipsilateral primary motor cortex, suggesting that fNaI is sensitive to distributed functional alterations. Open issues persist on the role of the glymphatic system in maintaining 23Na homeostasis, the role of excitation and inhibition as well as volume distributions during neuronal activity. Hemodynamic and physiological signal recordings coupled to realistic models of tissue function will be critical to understand the mechanisms of such changes and contribute to meeting the overarching challenge of measuring neuronal activity in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The packaging of DNA into chromatin determines the transcriptional potential of cells and is central to eukaryotic gene regulation. Recent sequencing of patient mutations has linked de novo loss-of-function mutations to chromatin remodeling factors with specific, causal roles in neurodevelopmental disorders. Characterizing cellular and molecular phenotypes arising from haploinsufficiency of chromatin remodeling factors could reveal convergent mechanisms of pathology. Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8 (CHD8) encodes a chromatin remodeling factor gene and has among the highest de novo loss-of-function mutations rates in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Mutations to CHD8 are expected to drive neurodevelopmental pathology through global disruptions to gene expression and chromatin state, however, mechanisms associated with CHD8 function have yet to be fully elucidated. We analyzed published transcriptomic and epigenomic data across CHD8 in vitro and in vivo knockdown and knockout models to identify convergent mechanisms of gene regulation by CHD8. We found reproducible high-affinity interactions of CHD8 near promoters of genes necessary for basic cell functions and gene regulation, especially chromatin organization and RNA processing genes. Overlap between CHD8 interaction and differential expression suggests that reduced dosage of CHD8 directly relates to decreased expression of these genes. In addition, genes important for neuronal development and function showed consistent dysregulation, though there was a reduced rate and decreased affinity for CHD8 interactions near these genes. This meta-analysis verifies CHD8 as a critical regulator of gene expression and reveals a consistent set of high affinity CHD8 interaction targets observed across human and mouse in vivo and in vitro studies. Our findings highlight novel core functions of CHD8 and indicate direct and downstream gene regulatory impacts that are likely to be associated with neuropathology underlying CHD8-associated neurodevelopmental disorder.",

Here, we track the dynamic localization of individual miRNAs, mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) to PBs using intracellular single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. We find that unused miRNAs stably bind to PBs, whereas functional miRNAs, repressed mRNAs and lncRNAs both transiently and stably localize within either the core or periphery of PBs, albeit to different extents. Consequently, translation potential and positioning of cis-regulatory elements significantly impact PB-localization dynamics of mRNAs. Using computational modeling and supporting experimental approaches we show that phase separation into large PBs attenuates mRNA silencing, suggesting that physiological mRNA turnover predominantly occurs outside of PBs. Instead, our data support a role for PBs in sequestering unused miRNAs to regulate their surveillance and provides a framework for investigating the dynamic assembly of RNP granules by phase separation at single-molecule resolution.",

    "abstract": "Genetically encoded small molecule sensors can facilitate metabolic engineering by enabling high-throughput detection of metabolite concentrations, directed evolution of host and pathway enzymes, and dynamic regulation. The engineered de novo vanillin biosynthesis pathway assembled in Escherichia coli is industrially relevant and ideal for biosensor deployment given that the pathway requires only three heterologous enzyme-catalyzed reactions, generates naturally occurring metabolites, and may benefit from dynamic regulation. However, pathway flux is stalled and diverted by the activity of the Homo sapiens catechol O-methyltransferase, which is intended to catalyze the conversion of protocatechuate to vanillate. To confront this challenge, we constructed and applied a vanillate sensor based on the Caulobacter crescentus VanR-VanO system. Using components from a previously characterized E. coli promoter library, we achieved greater than 14-fold dynamic range in our best rationally constructed sensor. We characterized sensor substrate specificity and found that this construct and an evolved variant are remarkably selective, exhibiting no detectable response to the regioisomer byproduct isovanillate. We then harnessed the evolved biosensor to conduct rapid bioprospecting of natural catechol O-methyltransferases. We identified eight that appear to have greater desired activity than the originally used variant, including three previously uncharacterized O-methyltransferases. Collectively, these efforts enrich our knowledge of how biosensing can aid metabolic engineering and constitute the foundation for future improvements in vanillin pathway productivity.",

Here, we use next-generation sequencing (NGS) with barcoding of individual RNA molecules to accurately and quantitatively detect favipiravir-induced mutations and to sample orders of magnitude more mutations than would be possible through Sanger sequencing. We demonstrate that favipiravir causes mutations and show that favipiravir primarily acts as a guanine analogue and secondarily as an adenine analogue resulting in the accumulation of transition mutations. We also use a standard NGS pipeline to show that the mutagenic effect of favipiravir can be measured by whole genome sequencing of virus.\\n\\nImportanceNew antiviral drugs are needed as a first line of defence in the event of a novel influenza pandemic. Favipiravir is a broad-spectrum antiviral which is effective against influenza. The exact mechanism of how favipiravir works to inhibit influenza is still unclear. We used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to demonstrate that favipiravir causes mutations in influenza RNA. The greater depth of NGS sequence information over traditional sequencing methods allowed us to precisely determine the bias of particular mutations caused by favipiravir. NGS can also be used in a standard diagnostic pipeline to show that favipiravir is acting on the virus by revealing the mutation bias pattern typical to the drug. Our work will aid in testing whether viruses are resistant to favipiravir and may help demonstrate the effect of favipiravir on viruses in a clinical setting. This will be important if favipiravir is used during a future influenza pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Eloquent information about the genetic basis of inheritance is important for any breeding program. Therefore, a diallel study was conducted under the influence of tomato leaf curl virus (TLCV) disease, using the eleven advanced lines of tomato. Firstly, the information regarding percent disease index (PDI) was determined via artificial screening with viruliferous whiteflies. Later, these lines were crossed in half diallel mating design to produce fifty-five one-way hybrids. These hybrids and parental genotypes were evaluated for seven morphological and three biochemical traits under open field conditions. Using the Griffing approach (Method II and Model I) basis of inheritance of traits were determined. Also, a Bayesian model was applied to the total yield descriptor. Correlations data indicated that total yield was not correlated with any other trait. The significant general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) values indicates exploitable genetic variation. The broad-sense heritability values were larger than narrow-sense heritability, showing that selection will be efficient for the improvement of these traits. Hybrid combinations H23, H42 and H49 can be considered efficient for the selection of multiple traits, including yield. Overall, this study provides a useful information regarding the genetics of important traits of tomato under TLCV infestation.",
