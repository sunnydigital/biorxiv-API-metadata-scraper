    "abstract": "Pattern separation is a process that minimizes overlap between patterns of neuronal activity representing similar experiences. Theoretical work suggests that the dentate gyrus (DG) performs this role for memory processing but a direct demonstration is lacking. One limitation is the difficulty to measure DG inputs and outputs simultaneously. To rigorously assess pattern separation by DG circuitry, we used mouse brain slices to stimulate DG afferents and simultaneously record DG granule cells (GCs) and interneurons. Output spiketrains of GCs are more dissimilar than their input spiketrains, demonstrating for the first time temporal pattern separation at the level of single neurons in the DG. Pattern separation is larger in GCs than in fast-spiking interneurons and hilar mossy cells, and is amplified in CA3 pyramidal cells. Analysis of the neural noise and computational modelling suggest that this form of pattern separation is not explained by simple randomness and arises from specific presynaptic dynamics. Overall, by reframing the concept of pattern separation in dynamic terms and by connecting it to the physiology of different types of neurons, our study offers a new window of understanding in how hippocampal networks might support episodic memory.",

    "abstract": "Noradrenaline (NA) and hypocretins/orexins (HCRT), and their receptors, dynamically modulate the circuits that configure behavioral states, and their associated oscillatory activities. Salient stimuli activate spiking of locus coeruleus noradrenergic (NALC) cells, inducing NA release and brain-wide noradrenergic signalling, thus resetting network activity, and mediating an orienting response. Hypothalamic HCRT neurons provide one of the densest input to NALC cells. To functionally address the HCRT-to-NA connection, we selectively disrupted the Hcrtr1 gene in NA neurons, and analyzed resulting (Hcrtr1Dbh-CKO) mice, and their control littermates electrocortical response in several contexts of enhanced arousal. Under enforced wakefulness (EW), or after cage change (CC), Hcrtr1Dbh-CKO mice exhibited a weakened ability to lower infra-{theta} frequencies (1-7 Hz), and mount a robust, narrow-bandwidth, high-frequency {theta} rhythm (~8.5 Hz). A fast-{gamma} (55-80 Hz) response, whose dynamics closely parallelled {theta}, also diminished, while {beta}/slow-{gamma} activity (15-45 Hz) increased. Furthermore, EW-associated locomotion was lower. Surprisingly, nestbuilding-associated wakefulness, inversely, featured enhanced {theta} and fast-{gamma} activities. Thus HCRT-to-NA signalling may fine-tune arousal, up in alarming conditions, and down during self-motivated, goal-driven behaviors. Lastly, slow-wave-sleep following EW and CC, but not nestbuilding, was severely deficient in slow-{delta} waves (0.75-2.25 Hz), suggesting that HCRT-to-NA signalling regulates the slow-{delta} rebound characterizing sleep after stress-associated arousal.",

We show that communication between cell-mimics allows distribution of tasks, quorum sensing, and cellular differentiation according to local environment.

The basic cochlea mechanics is extended by the new concept of the molecular filters, which allows us to discuss the transduction mechanism on the molecular level in the space-time domain. The molecular filters are supposed to be built on the set of the stereocilia of every inner hair cell. It is hypothesized that the molecular filters are the sensors in the feedback loop, which includes also outer hair cells along with the tectorial membrane and uses the zero compensation method to evaluate the traveling wave shape on the basilar membrane. Besides the compensation, the feedback loop, being spatially distributed along the cochlea, takes control over the tectorial membrane strain field generated by the outer hair cells, and implements it as the mechanism for the automatic gain control in the sound transduction.",

    "abstract": "We subjectively perceive our visual field with high fidelity, yet large peripheral distortions can go unnoticed and peripheral objects can be difficult to identify (crowding). A recent paper proposed a model of the mid-level ventral visual stream in which neural responses were averaged over an area of space that increased as a function of eccentricity (scaling). Human participants could not discriminate synthesised model images from each other (they were metamers) when scaling was about half the retinal eccentricity. This result implicated ventral visual area V2 and approximated \\\"Boumas Law\\\" of crowding. It has subsequently been interpreted as a link between crowding zones, receptive field scaling, and our rich perceptual experience. However, participants in this experiment never saw the original images. We find that participants can easily discriminate real and model-generated images at V2 scaling. Lower scale factors than even V1 receptive fields may be required to generate metamers. Efficiently explaining why scenes look as they do may require incorporating segmentation processes and global organisational constraints in addition to local pooling.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCorrect quantification of transcript expression is essential to understand the functional products of the genome in different physiological conditions and developmental stages. Recently, the development of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) allows the researchers to perform transcriptome analysis for the organisms without the reference genome and transcriptome. For such projects, de novo transcriptome assembly must be carried out prior to quantification. However, a large number of erroneous contigs produced by the assemblers might result in unreliable estimation on the abundance of transcripts. In this regard, this study comprehensively investigates how assembly quality affects the performance of quantification for RNA-Seq analysis based on de novo transcriptome assembly.\\n\\nResultsSeveral important factors that might seriously affect the accuracy of the RNA-Seq analysis were thoroughly discussed. First, we found that the assemblers perform comparatively well for the transcriptomes with lower biological complexity. Second, we examined the over-extended and incomplete contigs, and then demonstrated that assembly completeness has a strong impact on the estimation of contig abundance. Lastly, we investigated the behavior of the quantifiers with respect to sequence ambiguity which might be originally present in the transcriptome or accidentally produced by assemblers. The results suggest that the quantifiers often over-estimate the expression of family-collapse contigs and under-estimate the expression of duplicated contigs. For organisms without reference transcriptome, it remained challenging to detect the inaccurate abundance estimation on family-collapse contigs. On the contrary, we observed that the situation of under-estimation on duplicated contigs can be warned through analyzing the read distribution of the duplicated contigs.\\n\\nConclusionsIn summary, we explicated the behavior of quantifiers when erroneous contigs are present and we outlined the potential problems that the assemblers might cause for the downstream analysis of RNA-Seq. We anticipate the analytic results conducted in this study provides valuable insights for future development of transcriptome assembly and quantification.\\n\\nAvailabilitywe proposed an open-source Python based package QuantEval that builds connected components for the assembled contigs based on sequence similarity and evaluates the quantification results for each connected component.

    "abstract": "Demand for lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) has increased exponentially over the last decade, both for their roe, which is used as a caviar substitute, and increasingly also as cleaner fish to control sea lice in salmon farming. The species is classified as Near Threatened by the UICN and there are growing concerns that over-exploitation of wild stocks and translocation of hatchery-reared lumpfish may compromise the genetic diversity of native populations. We carried a comparative analysis of genetic and phenotypic variation across the species range to estimate the level of genetic and phenotypic differentiation, and determined patterns of gene flow at spatial scales relevant to management. We found five genetically distinct groups located in the West Atlantic (USA, and Canada), Mid Atlantic (Iceland), East Atlantic (Faroe Islands, Ireland, Scotland, Norway, and Denmark), English Channel (England) and Baltic Sea (Sweden). Significant phenotypic differences were also found, with Baltic lumpfish growing more slowly, attaining a higher condition factor and maturing at a smaller size than North Atlantic lumpfish. Estimates of effective population size were consistently low across the NE Atlantic (Iceland, Faroe Islands, Norway), the area where most wild lumpfish are fished for their roe, and also for the aquaculture industry. Our study suggests that some lumpfish populations are very small and have low genetic diversity, which makes them particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation and genetic introgression. To protect them we advocate curtailing fishing effort, closing the breeding cycle of the species in captivity to reduce dependence on wild stocks, restricting the translocation of genetically distinct populations, and limiting the risk of farm escapes.",

By integrative proteomic and glycoproteomic analysis of collagen-platelet interactive proteins with N-glycan manipulation, we demonstrate that the interaction of platelet adhesive receptors with collagen are highly N-glycan regulated, with glycans on many receptors playing positive roles on collagen binding, with glycans on other platelet glycoproteins exhibiting inhibitory roles on the binding to collagen.

    "abstract": "The wiring of the brain provides the anatomical skeleton for cognition and behavior. Connections among brain regions have a diverse and characteristic strength. This strength heterogeneity is captured by the wiring cost and homophily principles. Moreover, brains have a characteristic global network topology, including modularity and short path lengths. However, the mechanisms underlying the inter-regional wiring principles and global network topology of brains are unknown. Here, we address this issue by modeling the ontogeny of brain connectomes. We demonstrate that spatially embedded and heterochronous neurogenetic gradients, without the need of axonal-guidance molecules or activity-dependent plasticity, can reconstruct the wiring principles and shape the global network topology observed in adult brain connectomes. Thus, two fundamental dimensions, that is, space and time, are key components of a plausible neurodevelopmental mechanism with a universal scope, encompassing vertebrate and invertebrate brains.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disease affecting over 6 million people worldwide. Current diagnosis is based on clinical and observational criteria only, resulting in a high misdiagnosis rate. Approximately 75% of people with PD have hand tremor, which can precede clinical diagnosis by up to 6 years. Previous studies have shown that early PD can be accurately detected from keystroke features while typing, and this study investigated whether tremor can be detected as well. Typing data from 76 subjects, with and without PD, including 27 with PD and 15 with tremor, was analysed and showed that hand tremor in PD can be detected from keystroke features. This novel technique has not been used before and was able to achieve an overall sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 80% and was also able to differentiate PD tremor from essential tremor. This means that the diagnosis of early PD through typing can achieve the clinical requirement of at least two cardinal features being present (bradykinesia and tremor). Less than half a page of typing is needed, the technique does not require any specialised equipment, and can take place in the patients home as they type normally on a computer.",

Mechanisms for path integration, e.g. in attractor network models, predict stochastic drift of grid responses, which is not observed experimentally. We demonstrate a biologically plausible mechanism of dynamic self-organization by which border cells, which fire at environmental boundaries, can correct such drift in grid cells. In our model, experience-dependent Hebbian plasticity during exploration allows border cells to learn connectivity to grid cells. Border cells in this learned network reset the phase of drifting grids. This error-correction mechanism is robust to environmental shape and complexity, including enclosures with interior barriers, and makes distinctive predictions for environmental deformation experiments. Our work demonstrates how diverse cell types in the entorhinal cortex could interact dynamically and adaptively to achieve robust path integration.",

Here, we developed a framework that uses Drosophila STARR-seq data to create shape-matching filters based on enhancer-associated meta-profiles of epigenetic features. We combined these features with supervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machines) to predict enhancers. We demonstrated that our model could be applied to predict enhancers in mammalian species (i.e., mouse and human). We comprehensively validated the predictions using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches, involving transgenic assays in mouse and transduction-based reporter assays in human cell lines. Overall, the validations involved 153 enhancers in 6 mouse tissues and 4 human cell lines. The results confirmed that our model can accurately predict enhancers in different species without re-parameterization. Finally, we examined the transcription-factor binding patterns at predicted enhancers and promoters in human cell lines. We demonstrated that these patterns enable the construction of a secondary model effectively discriminating between enhancers and promoters.",

    "abstract": "Wildlife-vehicle collisions are of increasing concern with regards to the continuous and accelerating anthropogenic development. Preventing and mitigating collisions with wildlife will require a better understanding of the environmental and biological drivers of collision risks. Because species of large mammals differ in terms of food requirements, habitat selection and movement behaviours we tested at the management unit level if the density of collisions with red deer, roe deer and wild boar differed in terms of spatial distribution and explanatory factors. From 20,275 documented collisions in France between years 1990 and 2006, we found marked differences in the most influential environmental factors accounting for the density of collisions among the three species. The effect of road density was higher for the red deer than for the two other species and did not level off at our spatial-scale of observation. As expected, the annual hunting harvest - interpreted as a proxy of population abundance - was positively associated with the density of collisions for all species, being the strongest for red deer. While the collision density decreased with the proportion of forest in a management unit for wild boar, it increased with the fragmentation of forests for red deer that commute among forest patches between day and night. To reduce the number of wildlife- vehicle collisions, our results suggest to generalise road fencing and/or a control of abundance of large herbivore populations. Mitigation measures should target units where the collision risk is the highest for the most problematic species.",

    "abstract": "Previous approaches to investigating strategic social interaction in game theory have predominantly used games with clearly-defined turns and limited choices. However, most real-world social behaviors involve dynamic, coevolving decisions by interacting agents, which pose challenges for creating tractable models of behavior. Here, using a competitive game in which human participants control the dynamics of an on-screen avatar against either another human or a computer opponent, we show that it is possible to quantify the dynamic coupling between agents using nonparametric models. We use Gaussian Processes to model the joint distributions of players' actions and identities (human or computer) as a function of game state. Borrowing from a reinforcement learning framework, we successfully approximated both the policy and the value functions used by each human player in this competitive context. This approach offers a natural set of metrics for facilitating analysis at multiple timescales and suggests new classes of tractable paradigms for assessing human behavior.",

The theoretical setting of Bayesian inference has been suggested as a framework for understanding cortical computation.

In contrast to simplistic models of Bayesian inference, the underlying generative models representational choices are validated with real-world tasks that required efficient inference and strong generalization. The cortical circuit model is derived by systematically comparing the computational requirements of this model with known anatomical constraints. The derived model suggests precise functional roles for the feedforward, feedback and lateral connections observed in different laminae and columns, and assigns a computational role for the path through the thalamus.",

We explored the test-retest reliability of graph metrics of functional networks derived from resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Data were collected within two designs: (1) within sessions (WS) design where EEG data were collected from 18 healthy participants in four trials within a few hours and (2) between sessions (BS) design where EEG data were collected from 19 healthy participants in three trials on three different days at least one week apart. Electrophysiological source activity was reconstructed and functional connectivity between pairs of sensors or brain regions was determined in different frequency bands. We generated undirected binary graphs and used intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) to estimate reliability. We showed that reliabilities ranged from poor to good. Reliability at the sensor-level was significantly higher than source-level. The most reliable graph metric at the sensor-level was cost efficiency and at the source-level was global efficiency. At the sensor-level: WS reliability was significantly higher than BS reliability; high beta band in WS design had the highest reliability; in WS design reliability in gamma band was significantly lower than reliability in low and high beta bands. At the source-level: low beta band in BS design had the highest reliability; there was no significant main effect of frequency band on reliability; reliabilities of WS and BS designs were not significantly different. These results suggest that these graph metrics can provide reliable outcomes, depending on how the data were collected and analysed.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) is utilized to study the structure and dynamics of many bio-molecules, such as proteins, DNA and their various complexes. The structural assessment is based on the well-known Forster relationship between the measured efficiency of energy transfer between a donor (D) and an acceptor (A) dye and the distance between them. Classical smFRET analysis methods called photon distribution analysis (PDA) take into account photon shot-noise, D-A distance distribution and, more recently, interconversion between states in order to extract accurate distance information. It is known that rapid D-A distance fluctuations on the order of the D lifetime (or shorter) can increase the measured mean FRET efficiency and thus decrease the estimated D-A distance. Nonetheless, this effect has been so far neglected in smFRET experiments, potentially leading to biases in estimated distances.\\n\\nHere we introduce a PDA approach dubbed Monte-Carlo-diffusion-enhanced photon inference (MC-DEPI). MC-DEPI recolor detected photons of smFRET experiments taking into account dynamics of D-A distance fluctuations, multiple interconverting states and photo-blinking. Using this approach, we show how different underlying conditions may yield identical FRET histograms and how the additional information from fluorescence decays helps distinguishing between the different conditions. We also introduce a machine learning fitting approach for retrieving the D-A distance distribution, decoupled from the above-mentioned effects. We show that distance interpretation of smFRET experiments of even the simplest dsDNA is nontrivial and requires decoupling the effects of rapid D-A distance fluctuations on FRET in order to avoid systematic biases in the estimation of the D-A distance distribution.",

    "abstract": "1.Ants are among the most ecologically successful organisms on Earth, with a global distribution and diverse nesting and foraging ecologies. Ants are also social organisms, living in crowded, dense colonies that can range up to millions of individuals. Understanding the ecological success of the ants requires understanding how they have mitigated one of the major costs of social living-infection by parasitic organisms. Additionally, the ecological diversity of ants suggests that they may themselves harbor a diverse, and largely unknown, assemblage of parasites. As a first step, we need to know the taxonomic and functional diversity of the parasitic organisms infecting ants. To that end, we provide a comprehensive review of the parasitic organisms infecting ants by collecting all extant records. We synthesize major patterns in parasite ecology by categorizing how parasites encounter their ant hosts, whether they require host death as a developmental necessity, and how they transmit to future hosts.\\n\\nWe report 1,415 records of parasitic organisms infecting ants, the majority of which come from order Diptera (34.8%), phylum Fungi (25.6%), and order Hymenoptera (25.1%). Most parasitic organisms infecting ants are parasitoids (89.6%), requiring the death of their host as developmental necessity and most initially encounter their hosts in the extranidal environment (68.6%). Importantly, though most parasitic organisms infecting ants only need a single host to complete their life cycle (89.2%), the vast majority need to leave the nest before transmission to the next ant host can occur (88.3%), precluding ant-to-ant transmission within the nest. With respect to the host, we only found records for 9 out of 17 extant ant sub-families, and for 82 out of the currently recognized 334 ant genera. Though there is likely bias in the records reported, both host and parasite ecological traits and evolutionary histories underlie the pattern of ant-parasite association reported here. This work provides a foundation for future work that will begin to untangle the ecological drivers of ant-parasite relationships and the evolutionary implications thereof.",

Only two species have estimates substantially over 100, consistent with approximate panmixia, namely Helicobacter pylori and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Both species are far from demographic equilibrium, with diversity predicted to increase more than 30 fold in V. parahaemolyticus if the current value of Ner were maintained, to values much higher than found in any species. We propose that panmixia is unstable in bacteria, and that persistent environmental species are likely to evolve barriers to genetic exchange, which act to prevent a continuous increase in diversity by enhancing genetic drift.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results highlight the dynamic nature of bacterial population structures and imply that overall diversity levels found within a species are poor indicators of its size.",

Here we present Palantir, an algorithm that models trajectories of differentiating cells, which treats cell-fate as a probabilistic process, and leverages entropy to measure the changing nature of cell plasticity along the differentiation trajectory. Palantir generates a high resolution pseudotime ordering of cells, and assigns each cell state with its probability to differentiate into each terminal state. We apply Palantir to human bone marrow scRNA-seq data and detect key landmarks of hematopoietic differentiation.

Using liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS) we have identified a novel pathway of bile acid biosynthesis in SLOS avoiding cholesterol starting with 7-DHC. This pathway also proceeds to a minor extent in healthy individuals. Monitoring of the pathway products could provide a rapid diagnostic for SLOS while elevated levels of pathway intermediates could be responsible for some of the features of the disease.

    "abstract": "Here, we examined features of muscle coordination associated with reduced walking performance in chronic stroke survivors. Using motor module (a.k.a. muscle synergy) analysis, we identified differences in the modular control of overground walking and standing reactive balance in stroke survivors compared to age-similar neurotypical controls. In contrast to previous studies that demonstrated reduced motor module number post-stroke, our cohort of stroke survivors did not exhibit a reduction in motor module number compared to controls during either walking or reactive balance. Instead, the pool of motor modules common to walking and reactive balance was smaller, suggesting a reduction in generalizability of motor module function across behaviors. The motor modules common to walking and reactive balance tended to be less variable and more distinct, suggesting more reliable output compared to motor modules specific to one behavior. Indeed, higher levels of motor module generalization was associated with faster walking speeds in stroke survivors. Further, recruitment of a common independent plantarflexor module across both behaviors was associated with faster walking speeds. Our work is the first to show that motor module generalization across walking and balance may help to distinguish important and clinically-relevant differences in walking performance across stroke survivors that would have been overlooked by examining only a single behavior. Finally, as similar relationships between motor module generalization and walking performance have been demonstrated in healthy young adults and individuals with Parkinsons disease, our work suggests that motor module generalization across walking and balance may be important for well-coordinated walking.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyOur study is the first to simultaneously examine neuromuscular control of walking and standing reactive balance in stroke survivors. We show that motor module generalization across these behaviors (i.e., recruiting common motor modules) is reduced compared to neurotypical controls, which is associated with slower walking speeds. This is true despite no difference in motor module number between groups within each behavior, suggesting that motor module generalization across walking and balance is important for well-coordinated walking.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to profile the transcriptomes of a large number of individual cells at a high resolution. These data usually contain measurements of gene expression for many genes in thousands or tens of thousands of cells, though some datasets now reach the million-cell mark. Projecting high-dimensional scRNA-seq data into a low dimensional space aids downstream analysis and data visualization. Many recent preprints accomplish this using variational autoencoders (VAE), generative models that learn underlying structure of data by compress it into a constrained, low dimensional space. The low dimensional spaces generated by VAEs have revealed complex patterns and novel biological signals from large-scale gene expression data and drug response predictions. Here, we evaluate a simple VAE approach for gene expression data, Tybalt, by training and measuring its performance on sets of simulated scRNA-seq data. We find a number of counter-intuitive performance features: i.e., deeper neural networks can struggle when datasets contain more observations under some parameter configurations. We show that these methods are highly sensitive to parameter tuning: when tuned, the performance of the Tybalt model, which was not optimized for scRNA-seq data, outperforms other popular dimension reduction approaches - PCA, ZIFA, UMAP and t-SNE. On the other hand, without tuning performance can also be remarkably poor on the same data. Our results should discourage authors and reviewers from relying on self-reported performance comparisons to evaluate the relative value of contributions in this area at this time. Instead, we recommend that attempts to compare or benchmark autoencoder methods for scRNA-seq data be performed by disinterested third parties or by methods developers only on unseen benchmark data that are provided to all participants simultaneously because the potential for performance differences due to unequal parameter tuning is so high.",

    "abstract": "Animal behaviors are robust and flexible. To elucidate how these two conflicting features of behavior are encoded in the nervous system, we analyzed the neural circuits generating a C. elegans thermotaxis behavior, in which animals migrate toward the past cultivation temperature (Tc). We identified multiple circuits that are highly overlapping but individually regulate distinct behavioral components to achieve thermotaxis. When the regulation of a behavioral component is disrupted following single cell ablations, the other components compensate the deficit, enabling the animals to robustly migrate toward the Tc. Depending on whether the environmental temperature surrounding the animals is above or below the Tc, different circuits regulate the same behavioral components, mediating the flexible switch between migration up or down toward the Tc. These context-dependencies within the overlapping sub-circuits reveal the implementation of degeneracy in the nervous system, providing a circuit-level basis for the robustness and flexibility of behavior.",

    "abstract": "Remodeling of the three-dimensional organization of a genome has been previously described (e.g. condition-specific pairing or looping), but it remains unknown which factors specify and mediate such shifts in chromosome conformation. Here we describe an assay, MAP-C (Mutation Analysis in Pools by Chromosome conformation capture), that enables the simultaneous characterization of hundreds of cis or trans-acting mutations for their effects on a chromosomal contact or loop. As a proof of concept, we applied MAP-C to systematically dissect the molecular mechanism of inducible interchromosomal pairing between HAS1pr-TDA1pr alleles in Saccharomyces yeast. We identified three transcription factors, Leu3, Sdd4 (Ypr022c), and Rgt1, whose collective binding to nearby DNA sequences is necessary and sufficient for inducible pairing between binding site clusters. Rgt1 contributes to the regulation of pairing, both through changes in expression level and through its interactions with the Tup1/Ssn6 repressor complex. HAS1pr-TDA1pr is the only locus with a cluster of binding site motifs for all three factors in both S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum genomes, but the promoter for HXT3, which contains Leu3 and Rgt1 motifs, also exhibits inducible homolog pairing. Altogether, our results demonstrate that specific combinations of transcription factors can mediate condition-specific interchromosomal contacts, and reveal a molecular mechanism for interchromosomal contacts and mitotic homolog pairing.",
