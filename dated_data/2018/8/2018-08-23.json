    "abstract": "This report describes a R package, called the Individualized Coherent Absolute Risk Estimation (iCARE) tool, that allows researchers to build and evaluate models for absolute risk and apply them to estimate an individuals risk of developing disease during a specified time interval based on a set of user defined input parameters. An attractive feature of the software is that it gives users flexibility to update models rapidly based on new knowledge on risk factors and tailor models to different populations by specifying three input arguments: (1) a model for relative risk, (2) an age-specific disease incidence rate, (3) the distribution of risk factors for the population of interest. The tool can handle missing information on risk factors for individuals for whom risks are to be predicted using a coherent approach where all estimates are derived from a single model after appropriate model averaging. The software allows single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be incorporated into the model using published odds ratios and allele frequencies. The validation component of the software implements the methods for evaluation of model calibration, discrimination and risk-stratification based on independent validation datasets. We provide an illustration of the utility of iCARE for building, validating and applying absolute risk models using breast cancer as an example.",

    "abstract": "Morphological and archaeological studies suggest that the Americas were first occupied by non-Mongoloids with Australo-Melanesian traits (the Paleoamerican model), which was subsequently followed by Southwest Europeans coming in along the pack ice of the North Atlantic Ocean (the Solutrean model) and by East Asians and Siberians arriving by way of the Bering Strait. Past DNA studies, however, have produced different accounts. With a better understanding of genetic diversity, we have now reinterpreted public DNA data. Consistent with our recent finding of a close relationship between South Pacific populations and Denisovans or Neanderthals who were archaic Africans with Eurasian admixtures, the [~]9500 year old Kennewick Man skeleton with Australo-Melanesian affinity from North America was about equally related to Europeans and Africans, least related to East Asians among present-day people, and most related to the [~]42000 year old Neanderthal Mezmaiskaya-2 from Adygea Russia among ancient Eurasian DNAs. The [~]12700 year old Anzick-1 of the Clovis culture was most related to the [~]18720 year old El Miron of the Magdalenian culture in Spain among ancient DNAs. Amerindian mtDNA haplotypes, unlike their Eurasian sister haplotypes, share informative SNPs with Australo-Melanesians, Africans, or Neanderthals. These results suggest a unifying account of informative findings on the settlement of the Americas.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccurate assessment of health disparities requires unbiased knowledge of genetic risks in different populations. Unfortunately, most genome-wide association studies use genotyping arrays and European samples. Here, we integrate whole genome sequence data from global populations, results from thousands of GWAS, and extensive computer simulations to identify how genetic disease risks can be misestimated.\\n\\nResultsIn contrast to null expectations, we find that risk allele frequencies at known disease loci are significantly different for African populations compared to other continents. Strikingly, ancestral risk alleles are found at 9.51% higher frequency in Africa and derived risk alleles are found at 5.40% lower frequency in Africa. By simulating GWAS with different study populations, we find that non-African cohorts yield disease associations that have biased allele frequencies and that African cohorts yield disease associations that are relatively free of bias. We also find empirical evidence that genotyping arrays and SNP ascertainment bias contribute to continental differences in risk allele frequencies. Because of these causes, polygenic risk scores can be grossly misestimated for individuals of African descent. Importantly, continental differences in risk allele frequencies are only moderately reduced if GWAS use whole genome sequences and hundreds of thousands of cases and controls. Finally, comparisons between uncorrected and corrected genetic risk scores reveal the benefits of considering whether risk alleles are ancestral or derived.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results imply that caution must be taken when extrapolating GWAS results from one population to predict disease risks in another population.",

    "abstract": "One Sentence SummaryDNA replication establishes asymmetric epigenomes\n\nSummaryOne of the most fundamental questions in developmental biology concerns how cells with identical genomes differentiate into distinct cell types. One important context for understanding cell fate specification is asymmetric cell division, where the two daughter cells establish different cell fates following a single division. Many stem cells undergo asymmetric division to produce both a self-renewing stem cell and a differentiating daughter cell1-5. Here we show that histone H4 is inherited asymmetrically in asymmetrically dividing Drosophila male germline stem cells, similar to H36. In contrast, both H2A and H2B are inherited symmetrically. By combining superresolution microscopy with the chromatin fiber method, we are able to study histone inheritance patterns on newly replicated chromatin fibers. Using this technique, we find asymmetric inheritance patterns for old and new H3, but symmetric inheritance patterns for old and new H2A on replicating sister chromatids. Furthermore, co-localization studies on isolated chromatin fibers and proximity ligation assays on intact nuclei reveal that old H3 are preferentially incorporated by the leading strand while newly synthesized H3 are enriched on the lagging strand. Finally, using a sequential nucleoside analog incorporation assay, we detect a high incidence of unidirectional DNA replication on germline-derived chromatin fibers and DNA fibers. The unidirectional fork movement coupled with the strand preference of histone incorporation could explain how old and new H3 are asymmetrically incorporated by replicating sister chromatids. In summary, our work demonstrates that the intrinsic asymmetries in DNA replication may help construct sister chromatids enriched with distinct populations of histones. Therefore, these results suggest unappreciated roles for DNA replication in asymmetrically dividing cells in multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "Combining anti-cancer drugs has the potential to increase treatment efficacy. Because patient responses to drug combinations are highly variable, predictive biomarkers of synergy are required to identify which patients are likely to benefit from a drug combination. To aid biomarker identification, the DREAM challenge consortium has recently released data from a screen containing 85 cell lines and 167 drug combinations. The main challenge of these data is the low sample size: per drug combination, a median of 14 cell lines have been screened. We found that widely used methods in single drug response prediction, such as Elastic Net regression per drug, are not predictive in this setting. Instead, we propose to use multi-task learning: training a single model simultaneously on all drug combinations, which we show results in increased predictive performance. In contrast to other multi-task learning approaches, our approach allows for the identification of biomarkers, by using a modified random forest variable importance score, which we illustrate using artificial data and the DREAM challenge data. Notably, we find that mutations in MYO15A are associated with synergy between ALK / IGFR dual inhibitors and PI3K pathway inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCombining drugs is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. However, it is often not known which patients will benefit from a particular drug combination. To identify patients that are likely to benefit, we need to identify biomarkers, such as mutations in the tumors DNA, that are associated with favorable response to the drug combination. In this work, we identified such biomarkers using the drug combination data released by the DREAM challenge consortium, which contain 85 tumor cell lines and 167 drug combinations. The main challenge of these data is the extremely low sample size: a median of 14 cell lines have been screened per drug combination. We found that traditional methods to identify biomarkers for monotherapy response, which analyze each drug separately, are not suitable in this low sample size setting. Instead, we used a technique called multi-task learning to jointly analyze all drug combinations in a single statistical model. In contrast to existing multi-task learning algorithms, which are black-box methods, our method allows for the identification of biomarkers. Notably, we find that, in a subset of breast cancer cell lines, MYO15A mutations associate with response to the combination of ALK / IGFR dual inhibitors and PI3K pathway inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "In bacterial cells, gene expression, metabolism, and growth are highly interdependent and tightly coordinated. As a result, stochastic fluctuations in expression levels and instantaneous growth rate show intricate cross-correlations. These correlations are shaped by feedback loops, trade-offs and constraints acting at the cellular level; therefore a quantitative understanding requires an integrated approach. To that end, we here present a mathematical model describing a cell that contains multiple proteins that are each expressed stochastically and jointly limit the growth rate. Conversely, metabolism and growth affect protein synthesis and dilution. Thus, expression noise originating in one gene propagates to metabolism, growth, and the expression of all other genes. Nevertheless, under a small-noise approximation many statistical quantities can be calculated analytically. We identify several routes of noise propagation, illustrate their origins and scaling, and establish important connections between noise propagation and the field of metabolic control analysis. We then present a many-protein model containing > 1000 proteins parameterized by previously measured abundance data and demonstrate that the predicted cross-correlations between gene expression and growth rate are in broad agreement with published measurements.",

This limits their application to the study of adult human neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development, a process requiring maturation of muscle fibers in the presence of motor neuron endplates. Here we describe a three-dimensional (3D) co-culture method whereby human muscle progenitors mixed with human pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons self-organize to form functional NMJ connections within two weeks. Functional connectivity between motor neuron endplates and muscle fibers is confirmed with calcium transient imaging and electrophysiological recordings. Notably, we only observed epsilon acetylcholine receptor subunit protein upregulation and activity in 3D co-culture. This demonstrates that the 3D co-culture system supports a developmental shift from the embryonic to adult form of the receptor that does not occur in 2D co-culture. Further, 3D co-culture treatments with myasthenia gravis patient sera shows the ease of studying human disease with the system. This work delivers a simple, reproducible, and adaptable method to model and evaluate adult human NMJ de novo development and disease in culture.",

    "abstract": "Given the abundance, broad distribution, and diversity of roles that ants play in many ecosystems, they are an ideal group to serve as ecosystem indicators of climatic change. At present, only a few whole-genome sequences of ants are available (19 of > 16,000 species), mostly from tropical and sub-tropical species. To address this limited sampling, we sequenced genomes of temperate-latitude species from the genus Aphaenogaster, a genus with important seed dispersers. In total, we sampled seven colonies of six species: A. ashmeadi, A. floridana, A. fulva, A. miamiana, A. picea, and A. rudis. The geographic ranges of these species collectively span eastern North America from southern Florida to southern Canada, which encompasses a latitudinal gradient in which many climatic variables are changing rapidly. For the six genomes, we assembled an average of 271,039 contigs into 47,337 scaffolds. The mean genome size was 370.5 Mb, ranging from 310.3 to 429.7, which is comparable to that of other sequenced ant genomes (212.8 to 396.0 Mb) and flow cytometry estimates (210.7 to 690.4 Mb). In an analysis of currently sequenced ant genomes and the new Aphaenogaster sequences, we found that after controlling for both spatial autocorrelation and phylogenetics ant genome size was marginally correlated with sample site climate similarity. Of all examined climate variables, minimum temperature showed the strongest correlation with genome size, with ants from locations with colder minimum temperatures having larger genomes. These results suggest that temperature extremes could be a selective force acting on ant genomes and point to the need for more extensive sequencing of ant genomes.",

Finding general patterns in the expansion of natural populations is a major challenge in ecology and invasion biology. Classical spatio-temporal models predict that the carrying capacity (K) of the environment should have no influence on the speed (v) of an expanding population. We tested the generality of this statement with reaction-diffusion equations, stochastic individual-based models, and microcosms experiments with Trichogramma chilonis wasps. We investigated the dependence between K and v under different assumptions: null model (Fisher-KPP-like assumptions), strong Allee effects, and positive density-dependent dispersal. These approaches led to similar and complementary results. Strong Allee effects, positive density-dependent dispersal and demographic stochasticity in small populations lead to a positive dependence between K and v. A positive correlation between carrying capacity and propagation speed might be more frequent than previously expected, and be the rule when individuals at the edge of a population range are not able to fully drive the expansion.",

Behavioral genetics has revealed that most quantitative traits are heritable, suggesting that these phenotypic correlations may share genetic etiologies. We use GWAS data to estimate the genetic correlations between various measures of reproductive development (N= 52,776 - 318,863) and antisocial behavior (N= 31,968). Our genetic correlation analyses demonstrate that alleles associated with higher reproductive output (number of children ever born, rg=0.50, p=.0065) were positively correlated with alleles associated with antisocial behavior, whereas alleles associated with more delayed reproductive onset (age of first birth, rg=-.64, p=.0008) were negatively associated with alleles linked to antisocial behavior. Ultimately, these findings coalesce with evolutionary theories suggesting that increased antisocial behaviors may partly represent a faster life history approach, which may be significantly calibrated by genes.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveA listeners neural responses can be decoded to identify the speaker the person is attending to in a cocktail party environment. Such auditory attention detection methods have the potential to provide noise suppression algorithms in hearing devices with information about the listeners attention. A challenge is the effect of noise and other acoustic conditions that can reduce the attention detection accuracy. Specifically, noise can impact the ability of the person to segregate the sound sources and perform selective attention, as well as the external signal processing necessary to decode the attention effectively. The aim of this work is to systematically analyze the effect of noise level and speaker position on attention decoding accuracy.\\n\\nApproach28 subjects participated in the experiment. Auditory stimuli consisted of stories narrated by different speakers from 2 different locations, along with surrounding multi-talker background babble. EEG signals of the subjects were recorded while they focused on one story and ignored the other. The strength of the babble noise as well as the spatial separation between the two speakers were varied between presentations. Spatio-temporal decoders were trained for each subject, and applied to decode attention of the subjects from every 30s segment of data. Behavioral speech recognition thresholds were obtained for the different speaker separations.\\n\\nMain resultsBoth the background noise level and the angular separation between speakers affected attention decoding accuracy. Remarkably, attention decoding performance was seen to increase with the inclusion of moderate background noise (versus no noise), while across the different noise conditions performance dropped significantly with increasing noise level. We also observed that decoding accuracy improved with increasing speaker separation, exhibiting the advantage of spatial release from masking. Furthermore, the effect of speaker separation on the decoding accuracy became stronger when the background noise level increased. A significant correlation between speech intelligibility and attention decoding accuracy was found across conditions.\\n\\nSignificanceThis work shows how the background noise level and relative positions of competing talkers impact attention decoding accuracy. It indicates in which circumstances a neuro-steered noise suppression system may need to operate, in function of acoustic conditions. It also indicates the boundary conditions for the operation of EEG-based attention detection systems in neuro-steered hearing prostheses.\\n\\nIndex TermsAuditory attention detection, EEG processing, neuro-steered auditory prostheses, brain-computer interface, cocktail party, acoustic conditions.\\n\\nThe work is funded by KU Leuven Special Research Fund C14/16/057 and OT/14/119, FWO project nrs. 1.5.123.16N and G0A4918N, the ERC (637424) under the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, and a research gift of Starkey Hearing Technologies.

    "abstract": "RAVEN is a commonly used MATLAB toolbox for genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) reconstruction, curation and constraint-based modelling and simulation. Here we present RAVEN Toolbox 2.0 with major enhancements, including: (i) de novo reconstruction of GEMs based on the MetaCyc pathway database; (ii) a redesigned KEGG-based reconstruction pipeline; (iii) convergence of reconstructions from various sources; (iv) improved performance, usability, and compatibility with the COBRA Toolbox. Capabilities of RAVEN 2.0 are here illustrated through de novo reconstruction of GEMs for the antibiotic-producing bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. Comparison of the automated de novo reconstructions with the iMK1208 model, a previously published high-quality S. coelicolor GEM, exemplifies that RAVEN 2.0 can capture most of the manually curated model. The generated de novo reconstruction is subsequently used to curate iMK1208 resulting in Sco4, the most comprehensive GEM of S. coelicolor, with increased coverage of both primary and secondary metabolism. This increased coverage allows the use of Sco4 to predict novel genome editing targets for optimized secondary metabolites production. As such, we demonstrate that RAVEN 2.0 can be used not only for de novo GEM reconstruction, but also for curating existing models based on up-to-date databases. Both RAVEN 2.0 and Sco4 are distributed through GitHub to facilitate usage and further development by the community.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCellular metabolism is a large and complex network. Hence, investigations of metabolic networks are aided by in silico modelling and simulations. Metabolic networks can be derived from whole-genome sequences, through identifying what enzymes are present and connecting these to formalized chemical reactions. To facilitate the reconstruction of genome-scale models of metabolism (GEMs), we have developed RAVEN 2.0. This versatile toolbox can reconstruct GEMs fast, through either metabolic pathway databases KEGG and MetaCyc, or from homology with an existing GEM. We demonstrate RAVENs functionality through generation of a metabolic model of Streptomyces coelicolor, an antibiotic-producing bacterium. Comparison of this de novo generated GEM with a previously manually curated model demonstrates that RAVEN captures most of the previous model, and we subsequently reconstructed an updated model of S. coelicolor: Sco4. Following, we used Sco4 to predict promising targets for genetic engineering, which can be used to increase antibiotic production.",

    "abstract": "Open modification searching (OMS) is a powerful search strategy that identifies peptides carrying any type of modification by allowing a modified spectrum to match against its unmodified variant by using a very wide precursor mass window. A drawback of this strategy, however, is that it leads to a large increase in search time. Although performing an open search can be done using existing spectral library search engines by simply setting a wide precursor mass window, none of these tools have been optimized for OMS, leading to excessive runtimes and suboptimal identification results. Here we present the ANN-SoLo tool for fast and accurate open spectral library searching. ANN-SoLo uses approximate nearest neighbor indexing to speed up OMS by selecting only a limited number of the most relevant library spectra to compare to an unknown query spectrum. This approach is combined with a cascade search strategy to maximize the number of identified unmodified and modified spectra while strictly controlling the false discovery rate, as well as a shifted dot product score to sensitively match modified spectra to their unmodified counterparts. ANN-SoLo achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of speed and the number of identifications. On a previously published human cell line data set, ANN-SoLo confidently identifies more spectra than SpectraST or MSFragger and achieves a speedup of an order of magnitude compared to SpectraST.\\n\\nANN-SoLo is implemented in Python and C++.

    "abstract": "How cell to cell interactions control local tissue growth to attain a species-specific pattern and organ size is a central question in developmental biology. The Drosophila Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule, Fasciclin 2 (Drosophila NCAM), is expressed during the development of neural and epithelial organs. Genetic mosaic analysis of Fasciclin 2 reveals two complementary and opposing functions during imaginal disc growth, a cell autonomous requirement to promote growth and an opposite non-cell autonomous function to restrain growth at high expression levels. This non-cell autonomous function is mediated by the Fasciclin 2 heterophilic-binding partners CG15630 and CG33543. We show that EGFR physically interacts with Fasciclin 2 and mediates both the cell autonomous and the non-cell autonomous function. We further show that EGFR activity in turn promotes the cell autonomous expression of Fasciclin 2. We suggest that the auto-stimulatory loop between EGFR and Fasciclin 2 operates until reaching a threshold where the Fasciclin 2 non-cell autonomous function counteracts the growth-promoting activity of the homophilic interaction to terminate imaginal disc growth. Accordingly, we have found that Fasciclin 2 limits imaginal disc growth by the end of larval development. Cellular integration of Fasciclin 2 autonomous and non-cell autonomous signaling from neighbor cells may be a key regulator component to orchestrate the rate of intercalary cell proliferation and the final size of an organ.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryOne of the key unsolved problems in Biology is how a species-specific size is attained during animal development. During development cells should compute the amount of intercalary tissue growth to stop cell proliferation when reaching a correct pattern and size. Classic studies demonstrated that local cell interactions are key in controlling organ growth to reach a correct size and pattern in vertebrates and invertebrates. We present evidence strongly suggesting that Fasciclin 2 (the ortholog of NCAM in Drosophila) functions as a growth level switch to control pattern and organ size. First, we use genetic mosaic analyses to show that Fasciclin 2 promotes organ growth in a cell autonomous manner. Then we show that Fasciclin 2 restrains growth at high expression levels in a non-cell autonomous manner, and that there is a requirement for Fasciclin 2 to limit growth by the end of larval development. This function is dependent on Fasciclin 2 heterophilic binding partners CG15630 and CG33543. The Epidermal Growth Factor receptor mediates both functional facets of Fasciclin 2 and its activity in turn increases Fasciclin 2 cell autonomous expression, suggesting the existence of a functional auto-stimulatory loop. We also show that the Epidermal Growth Factor receptor and Fasciclin 2 physically interact. Our results show that the amount of Fasciclin 2 between cells determines organ size by acting as an expression level switch for EGFR function, and suggest that other specific CAM interactions may integrate similar expression level switches acting as a code for cells to compute local growth in attaining a species-specific organ size and shape.",

Due to the complexity of the disease epidemiology and the lack of data there is a need to use inferential computational approaches to fill the gaps in our understanding of the circulation of FMD virus on this continent. Using a phylogeographic approach we reconstructed the circulation of FMD virus serotypes A, O and SAT2 in Africa and evaluated the influence of potential environmental and anthropological predictors of virus diffusion. Our results show that over the last hundred year the continental circulation of the tree serotypes was mainly driven by livestock trade. Whilst our analyses show that the serotypes A and O were introduced in Africa trough livestock trades, the SAT2 serotype probably originates from African wildlife population. The circulation of serotype O in eastern Africa is impacted by both indirect transmission through persistence in the environment and anthropological activities such as cattle movements.",

    "abstract": "The most devastating nematodes to worldwide agriculture are the root-knot nematodes with Meloidogyne incognita being the most widely distributed and damaging species. This parasitic and ecological success seem surprising given its supposed obligatory clonal reproduction. Clonal reproduction has been suspected based on cytological observations but, so far, never confirmed by population genomics data. At the species level, M. incognita is highly polyphagous with thousands of host plants. However, the host range varies among different M. incognita isolates that may present distinct and more restricted host compatibilities. Historically, four  host races had been defined as a function of ranges of compatible and incompatible plants. We sequenced the genomes of 11 isolates across Brazil, covering these four distinct races to assess (i) how clonal reproduction is and (ii) how the level of genome variability associates with biological traits such as the host races, affected agronomic culture, and geographical distribution. By aligning the genomic reads of the isolates to the M. incognita reference genome assembly, we identified SNV and small-scale insertions/deletions. Analysis of linkage disequilibrium and 4-gametes test, showed no sign of recombination, confirming the clonal mode of reproduction of M. incognita. We showed that there are relatively few point variations between the different isolates, and these variations show no significant association with either the host races, the geographical origin of the samples or the host plant on which they have been collected. Due to the lack of phylogenetic signal underlying their existence, we recommend the discontinuation of the terminology  race. Overall, these results suggest that multiple gains and losses of parasitic abilities and adaptations to different environmental conditions account for the broad host spectrum and wide geographic distribution of M. incognita. Hence, this nematode constitutes a model species to study adaptability without sexual recombination and overall low genomic variations in animals.",

Here we find that Intrasporangium calvum C5, a novel menaquinone-based dual-pathway denitrifier/respiratory ammonifier, disproportionately utilizes ammonification rather than denitrification when grown under carbon or nitrate limitation, not C:NO3- ratio. Higher growth rates are promoted by ammonification and metabolite and transcriptional profiles during growth show that the bacterium produces its own formate from a fermentable carbon source (lactate) to further generate a proton motive force for the ammonification pathway. Transcript abundances encoding for nitrite reducing enzymes, NrfAH and NirK, also significantly increase in response to nitrite production. Mechanistically, our results suggest that pathway selection is driven by intracellular redox potential (redox poise), which may be lowered during resource limitation, thereby decreasing catalytic activity of upstream electron transport steps needed for denitrification enzymes.

    "abstract": "Genomic imprinting, where an alleles expression pattern depends on its parental origin, is thought to result primarily from an intragenomic evolutionary conflict. Imprinted genes are widely expressed in the brain and have been linked to various phenotypes, including behaviors related to risk tolerance. In this paper, we analyze a model of evolutionary bet-hedging in a system with imprinted gene expression. Previous analyses of bet-hedging have shown that natural selection may favor alleles and traits that reduce reproductive variance, even at the expense of reducing mean reproductive success, with the trade-off between mean and variance depending on the population size. In species where the sexes have different reproductive variances, this bet-hedging trade-off differs between maternally and paternally inherited alleles. Where males have the higher reproductive variance, alleles are more strongly selected to reduce variance when paternally inherited than when maternally inherited. We connect this result to phenotypes connected with specific imprinted genes, including delay discounting and social dominance. The empirical patterns are consistent with paternally expressed imprinted genes promoting risk-averse behaviors that reduce reproductive variance. Conversely, maternally expressed imprinted genes promote risk-tolerant, variance-increasing behaviors. We indicate how future research might further test the hypotheses suggested by our analysis.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in transmembrane inner ear (TMIE) cause deafness in humans; previous studies suggest involvement in the mechano-electrical transduction (MET) complex in sensory hair cells, but TMIEs precise role is unclear. In tmie zebrafish mutants, we observed that GFP-tagged Tmc1 and Tmc2b, which are putative subunits of the MET channel, fail to target to the hair bundle. In contrast, overexpression of Tmie strongly enhances the targeting of Tmc2b-GFP to stereocilia. To identify the motifs of Tmie underlying the regulation of the Tmcs, we systematically deleted or replaced peptide segments. We then assessed localization and functional rescue of each mutated/chimeric form of Tmie in tmie mutants. We determined that the first putative helix was dispensable and identified a novel critical region of Tmie, the extracellular region and transmembrane domain, which mediates both mechanosensitivity and Tmc2b-GFP expression in bundles. Collectively, our results suggest that Tmies role in sensory hair cells is to target and stabilize Tmc subunits to the site of MET.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHair cells mediate hearing and balance through the activity of a pore-forming channel in the cell membrane. The transmembrane inner ear (TMIE) protein is an essential component of the protein complex that gates this so-called mechanotransduction channel. While it is known that loss of TMIE results in deafness, the function of TMIE within the complex is unclear. Using zebrafish as a deafness model, Pacentine and Nicolson demonstrate that Tmie is required for the localization of other essential complex members, the transmembrane channel-like (Tmc) proteins, Tmc1/2b. They then evaluate twelve unique versions of Tmie, each containing mutations to different domains of Tmie. This analysis reveals that some mutations in Tmie cause dysfunctional gating of the channel as demonstrated through reduced hair cell activity, and that these same dysfunctional versions also display reduced Tmc expression at the normal site of the channel. These findings link hair cell activity with the levels of Tmc in the bundle, reinforcing the currently-debated notion that the Tmcs are the pore-forming subunits of the mechanotransduction channel. The authors conclude that Tmie, through distinct regions, is involved in both trafficking and stabilizing the Tmcs at the site of mechanotransduction.",

While the mechanisms underlying PTH remain elusive, recent studies in rodent models suggest the potential involvement of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a mediator of neurogenic inflammation, and the ensuing activation of meningeal mast cells (MCs), pro-algesic resident immune cells that can lead to the activation of the headache pain pathway. Here, we investigated the relative contribution of MCs to the development of PTH-like pain behaviors in a model of mild closed head injury (mCHI) in male rats. We initially tested the relative contribution of peripheral CGRP signaling to the activation of meningeal MCs following mCHI using an anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody. We then employed a prophylactic MC granule depletion approach to address the hypotheses that intact meningeal MC granule content is necessary for the development of PTH-related pain-like behaviors. The data suggest that following mCHI, ongoing activation of meningeal MCs is not mediated by peripheral CGRP signaling, and does not contribute to development of the mCHI-evoked cephalic mechanical pain hypersensitivity. Our data, however, also reveals that the development of latent sensitization, manifested as persistent hypersensitivity upon the recovery from mCHI-evoked acute cranial hyperalgesia to the headache trigger glyceryl trinitrate requires intact MC content during and immediately after mCHI. Collectively, our data implicate the acute activation of meningeal MCs as mediator of chronic pain hypersensitivity following a concussion or mCHI. Targeting MCs may be explored for early prophylactic treatment of PTH.",

Intestinal microbiota composition was determined before intervention (baseline, S1), 2 weeks after a crash diet (S2), and 1 week (S3), 3 months (S4) and 6 months (S5) after surgery.\\n\\nResultsRelative to S1, the microbial diversity index declined at S2 and S3 (p< 0.05), and gradually returned to baseline levels at S5. The crash diet was associated with an increased abundance of Rikenellaceae and decreased abundances of Ruminococcaceae and Streptococcaceae (p< 0.05). After surgery, at S3, the relative abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae had decreased (compared to the moment directly after the crash diet), whereas those of Streptococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae had increased (p< 0.05).

We use machine learning to train classifiers performing synaptic integration across the neuronal population activity, and show that synaptic integration across first-order neurons can process edge orientations with high acuity and speed. In particular, our models suggest that integration of fast-decaying (AMPA-like) synaptic inputs within short timescales is critical for discriminating fine orientations, whereas integration of slow-decaying (NMDA-like) synaptic inputs refine discrimination and maintain robustness over longer timescales. Taken together, our results provide new insight into the computations occurring in the earliest stages of the human tactile processing pathway and how they may be critical for supporting hand function.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryOur ability to manipulate objects relies on tactile inputs signaled by first-order neurons that innervate mechanoreceptors in the skin of the hand and have spatially-complex receptive fields.

Furthermore, the presence of microbiota and biogenic molecules, produced by among others marine phytoplankton, in SSAs could lead to potential human health effects. Yet the exposure and effects of SSAs on human health remain poorly studied. Here, we exposed human epithelial lung cells to different concentrations of extracts of a natural sea spray aerosol (SSA), a laboratory-generated SSA, the marine algal toxin homoyessotoxin and a chemical mTOR inhibitor. The mTOR inhibitor was included as it has been hypothesized that natural SSAs may influence the mTOR cell signaling pathway. We observed significant effects on the mTOR pathway and PCSK9 in all exposures. Based on these expression patterns, a clear dose response relationship was observed. Our results indicate a potential for positive health effects when lung cells are exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of natural SSAs, whereas potential negative effects were observed at high levels of the laboratory SSA and the marine algal toxin. Overall, these results provide a substantial molecular evidence base for potential positive health effects of SSAs at environmentally relevant concentrations through the mTOR pathway. The results provided here suggest that SSAs contain biomolecules with significant pharmaceutical potential in targeting PCSK9.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput viral genetic sequencing is needed to monitor the spread of drug resistance, direct optimal antiretroviral regimes, and to identify transmission dynamics in generalised HIV epidemics. Public health efforts to sequence HIV genomes at scale face three major technical challenges: (i) minimising assay cost and protocol complexity, (ii) maximising sensitivity, and (iii) recovering accurate and unbiased sequences of both the genome consensus and the within-host viral diversity. Here we present a novel, high-throughput, virus-enriched sequencing method and computational pipeline tailored specifically to HIV (veSEQ-HIV), which addresses all three technical challenges, and can be used directly on leftover blood drawn for routine CD4 testing. We demonstrate its performance on 1,620 plasma samples collected from consenting individuals attending 10 large urban clinics in Zambia, partners of HPTN 071 (PopART). We show that veSEQ-HIV consistently recovers complete HIV genomes from the majority of samples of different subtypes, and is also quantitative: the number of HIV reads per sample obtained by veSEQ-HIV estimates viral load without the need for additional testing. Both quantitativity and sensitivity were assessed on a subset of 126 samples with clinically measured viral loads, and with standardized quantification controls (VL 100 - 5,000,000 RNA copies/ml). Complete HIV genomes were recovered from 93% (85/91) of samples when viral load was over 1,000 copies per ml. The quantitative nature of the assay implies that variant frequencies estimated with veSEQ-HIV are representative of true variant frequencies in the sample. Detection of minority variants can be exploited for epidemiological analysis of transmission and drug resistance, and we show how the information contained in individual reads of a veSEQ-HIV sample can be used to detect linkage between multiple mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral therapy. Less than 2% of reads obtained by veSEQ-HIV were identified as in silico contamination events using updates to the phyloscanner software (phyloscanner clean) that we show to be 95% sensitive and 99% specific at  decontaminating NGS data. The cost of the assay -- approximately 45 USD per sample -- compares favourably with existing VL and HIV genotyping tests, and provides the additional value of viral load quantification and inference of drug resistance with a single test. veSEQ-HIV is well suited to large public health efforts and is being applied to all [~]9000 samples collected for the HPTN 071-2 (PopART Phylogenetics) study.",

    "abstract": "The resolution of the Tree of Life has accelerated with advances in DNA sequencing technology. To achieve dense sampling, it is often necessary to obtain DNA from historical museum specimens to supplement modern genetic samples. However, DNA from historical material is generally degraded and fragmented, which presents various challenges. In this study, we evaluated how the coverage at variant sites and missing data among historical and modern sample types impacts phylogenomic inference. We explored these patterns in the brush-tongued parrots (lories and lorikeets) of Australasia by sampling ultraconserved elements in 105 taxa. Trees estimated with low coverage sites had several clades where historical or modern samples clustered together, which were not observed in trees with more stringent filtering. To assess if the aberrant relationships were affected by missing data, we performed a targeted outlier analysis of sites and loci and a more general data reduction approach where we excluded sites based on a percentage of data completeness. The outlier analyses showed that 6.6% of total sites were driving the topological differences among trees built with and without low coverage sites, and at these sites, historical samples had 7.5x more missing data than modern ones. An examination of subclades identified loci biased by missing data, and the exclusion of these loci shifted phylogenetic relationships. Predictive modeling found that outlier analysis scores were not correlated with summary statistics of locus alignments, indicating that outlier loci do not have characteristics differing from other loci. Excluding missing data by percentage completeness indicated that sites with 70% completeness were necessary to avoid spurious relationships, but more stringent conditions of data completeness produced less-resolved trees. After accounting for biased loci and understanding the stability of relationships, we inferred a more robust phylogenetic hypothesis for lories and lorikeets.",

    "abstract": "Organelle morphology reflects an equilibrium between membrane fusion and fission that determines size, shape and copy number. By studying the yeast vacuole as a model, the conserved molecular mechanisms responsible for organelle fusion have been revealed. However, a detailed understanding of vacuole fission and how these opposing processes respond to the cell cycle, osmoregulation or metabolism to change morphology remain elusive. Thus, herein we describe a new fluorometric assay to measure vacuole fission in vitro. For proof-of-concept, we use this assay to confirm that acetate, a key intermediary metabolite, triggers vacuole fission in vitro and show that it also blocks homotypic vacuole fusion. The basis of this effect is distinct from hypertonic stress, a known trigger of fission and inhibitor of fusion that inactivates the Rab-GTPase Ypt7: Treatment with the phosphatidylinositol-kinase inhibitor wortmannin or the catalytic domain of the Rab-GAP (GTPase Activating Protein) Gyp1 reveal that fission can be triggered by Ypt7 inactivation alone in absence of hypertonic stress, placing it upstream of PI-3,5-P2 synthesis and osmosis required for membrane scission. Whereas acetate seems to block PI-4-kinase to possibly increase the pool of PI on vacuole membranes needed to synthesize sufficient PI-3,5-P2 for fission. Thus, we speculate that both PI-4-P and PI-3-P arms of PI-P signaling drive changes in membrane fission and fusion responsible altering vacuole morphology in response to cellular metabolism or osmoregulation.\\n\\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=190 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/398685_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (28K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@896c6dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2d8100org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1702e45org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eddbba_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Birds exhibit a wide variety of migration strategies, not only between species, but also within species. Populations might migrate to specific sites outside of the breeding season, but individuals within populations may also exhibit different migration strategies. Young, unexperienced birds may take different routes, visit different sites, and time their annual cycle differently than adults. In turn, within groups of adult birds, there may be a division between the sexes whereby males and females migrate to different sites or, more commonly, at different times. We investigated differences in the migration strategies of male and female ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) from a breeding population in northeastern Germany. An important difference between the sexes was the much earlier leaving of the breeding place by the females compared to the males. The difference in the timing of departure was much more pronounced compared to most other raptor species. The other main difference between the male and female ospreys was the distance that the birds accumulated over the annual cycle, with males generally moving more while at the breeding ground compared with the non-breeding grounds, and the opposite in females. An exception to this observation was two males that migrated to the Iberian Peninsula, that covered longer distances during the non-breeding season. Consequently, individuals accumulated the same distances over the course of an annual cycle, regardless of sex or migration strategy. Unexpectedly, a difference in the timing of the annual cycle between the sexes occurred at the breeding grounds with females leaving 2 to 3 months before the males, long before the young had fledged. Because males migrated much faster and, unlike the females, did not make prolonged stops, their arrival times at the non-breeding grounds were not different. Return migration to the breeding grounds was very similar between the sexes, and even the two males that spent the non-breeding season on the Iberian Peninsula did not arrive before any of the other birds. Thus, a shorter migration distance is not necessarily associated with an advantage with respect to a timely return to the breeding grounds.",

    "abstract": "Rice is a staple food for the majority of our worlds growing population. Whereas Asian rice (Oryza sativa L.) has been extensively studied, the exact origins of African rice (Oryza glaberrima Steud.) are still contested. Previous studies have supported either a centric or a non-centric origin of African rice domestication. Here we review the evidence for both scenarios through a critical reassessment of 206 whole genome sequences of domesticated and wild African rice. While genetic diversity analyses support a severe bottleneck caused by domestication, signatures of recent and strong positive selection do not unequivocally point to candidate domestication genes, suggesting that domestication proceeded differently than in Asian rice - either by selection on different alleles, or different modes of selection. Population structure analysis revealed five genetic clusters localising to different geographic regions. Isolation by distance was identified in the coastal populations, which could account for parallel adaptation in geographically separated demes. Although genome-wide phylogenetic relationships support an origin in the eastern cultivation range followed by diversification along the Atlantic coast, further analysis of domestication genes shows distinct haplotypes in the southwest - suggesting that at least one of several key domestication traits might have originated there. These findings shed new light on an old controversy concerning plant domestication in Africa by highlighting the divergent roots of African rice cultivation, including a separate centre of domestication activity in the Guinea Highlands. We thus suggest that the commonly accepted centric origin of African rice must be reconsidered in favour of a non-centric or polycentric view.",

In this paper, a winter wheat field of 28.5 hm2 under traditional cultivation model in Tianzhuang town of Huantai county was selected as the research area. Sampling by mesh point method (60x60m), the variation characteristics of soil available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) in the before sowing, reviving stage, jointing stage, filling stage of winter wheat were analyzed by the method of geostatistics and GIS. At the same time, Pearson correlation analysis was used to study the response of wheat growth and development to soil nutrient variation. As the growth period goes by, 1) each nutrient showed low-high-low and moderate variability. AN and AK had the highest content at reviving stage, while AP at jointing stage, as turning point. The order of variability of each nutrient was AN>AP>AK. 2) The difference of nutrient variation first increased and then decreased, and showed medium to strong spatial correlation.\\n\\nThree nutrients in the before sowing stage were strong spatial correlation, and the reviving stage was medium spatial correlation, to the jointing and filling stages, AN was medium spatial correlation, AP and AK were strong spatial correlation. The spatial correlation of each nutrients was the weakest in the reviving stage, and AN was the strongest in the before sowing stage, while AP and AK were strongest in the jointing stage. The spatial correlation of each soil nutrients decreased from before sowing to reviving stage, jointing stage to filling stage, and the spatial correlation increased from reviving stage to jointing stage. 3) Soil nutrient content first increased and then decreased, and the grade of nutrient gradually decreased. 4) The correlation between soil nutrients and wheat growth was gradually increasing. AN had the highest correlation with wheat growth, followed by AK and AP lowest. The effect of soil nutrients on the growth of wheat at the reviving stage was higher than that of the current nutrient, and the growth of wheat at jointing stage was mainly influenced by the current nutrient, while the growth of wheat at the filling period was both influenced by the nutrient content of the last and the current period; the date to supplement fertilizer should be postponed properly. In this study, the soil nutrient dynamics and its influence on the growth of wheat during the winter wheat growth period under the traditional field model were well understood, which could provide a theoretical basis for the precision management of soil nutrients in the northern winter wheat area with relatively uniform planting environment and cultivation management.",

The Cardiff Classifier is an objective classification tool applied previously to examine the extent of biomechanical recovery following TKR. In this study, it is further developed to reveal the salient features that contribute to recovery towards healthy function.\\n\\nMethodsGait analysis was performed on 30 patients before and after TKR surgery, and 30 healthy controls. Median TKR follow-up time was 13 months. The combined application of principal component analysis (PCA) and the Cardiff Classifier defined 18 biomechanical features that discriminated OA from healthy gait. Statistical analysis tested whether these features were affected by TKR surgery and, if so, whether they recovered to values found for the controls.\\n\\nResultsThe Cardiff Classifier successfully discriminated between OA and healthy gait in all 60 cases. Of the 18 discriminatory features, only six (33%) were significantly affected by surgery, including features in all three planes of the ground reaction force (p<0.001), ankle dorsiflexion moment (p<0.001), hip adduction moment (p=0.003), and transverse hip angle (p=0.007). All but two (89%) of these features remained significantly different to those of the control group after surgery.\\n\\nConclusionsThis approach was able to discriminate gait biomechanics associated with knee OA. The ground reaction force provided the strongest discriminatory features. Despite increased gait velocity and improvements in self-reported pain and function, which would normally be clinical indicators of recovery, the majority of features were not affected by TKR surgery.

    "abstract": "Range-size distributions are important for understanding species richness patterns and led to the development of the controversial Rapoports rule and Rapoport-rescue effect. This study aimed to understand the relationship between species richness and range-size distribution in relation to environmental factors. The present study tested the following: (1) altitudinal Rapoports rule, (2) climatic and ambient energy hypotheses, (3) non-directional rescue effect, and (4) effect of environmental factors on range-size group. Altitudinal species range-size distribution increased with increasing altitude and showed a negative relationship with climatic variables and habitat heterogeneity, and a positive relationship with primary productivity. These results support the altitudinal Rapoports rule and climatic hypothesis; however, they do not fully support the ambient energy hypothesis. Results from testing the non-directional rescue effect showed that the inflow intensity of species from both directions (high and low elevations) affected species richness. And we found that the 2nd and 3rd quartile species distribution were the main cause of a mid-peak of species richness and the non-directional rescue effect. Additionally, the 2nd quartile species richness was highly related to minimum temperature and possessed thermal specialist species features, and the 3rd quartile species richness was highly related to habitat heterogeneity and primary productivity. Although altitudinal range-size distribution results were similar to the altitudinal Rapoports rule, the mid-peak pattern of species richness could not be explained by the Rapoports-rescue effect; however, the non-directional rescue effect could explain a mid-peak pattern of species richness.",

Transgenic plants generated by employing such methods offer the prospect of low-cost sustainable pest management; in this regard, we used chloroplast targeting and cytosolic mevalonic acid pathway enhancement in this study to investigate the interaction of santalenes and bergamotene with insects. The santalene- and bergamotene-emitting transgenic tobacco plants thus generated were utilized to study host preference in the green peach aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer). The results showed that co-expression of either 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) or truncated HMGR with santalene synthase led to the production of higher amounts of santalenes and bergamotene in transgenic tobacco plants, and that these santalene- and bergamotene-emitting plants were attractive to green peach aphids. We accordingly propose that such transgenic plants may have potential application in pest management as a trap crop to prevent green peach aphid infestation of wild-type tobacco plants.",

    "abstract": "Polar auxin transport lies at the core of many self-organizing phenomena sustaining continuous plant organogenesis. In angiosperms, the shoot apical meristem is a potentially unique system in which the two main modes of auxin-driven patterning-- convergence and canalization--co-occur in a coordinated manner and in a fully three-dimensional geometry. In the epidermal layer, convergence points form, from which auxin is canalized towards inner tissue. Each of these two patterning processes has been extensively investigated separately, but the integration of both in the shoot apical meristem remains poorly understood. We present here a first attempt of a three-dimensional model of auxin-driven patterning during phyllotaxis. We base our simulations on a biochemically plausible mechanism of auxin transport proposed by Cieslak et al. (2015) which generates both convergence and canalization patterns. We are able to reproduce most of the dynamics of PIN1 polarization in the meristem, and we explore how the epidermal and inner cell layers act in concert during phyllotaxis. In addition, we discuss the mechanism by which initiating veins connect to the already existing vascular system.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe regularity of leaf arrangement around stems has long puzzled scientists. The key role played by the plant hormone auxin is now well established. On the surface of the tissue responsible for leaf formation, auxin accumulates at several points, from which new leaves eventually emerge. Auxin also guides the progression of new veins from the nascent leaves to the vascular system of the plant. Models of auxin transport have been developed to explain either auxin accumulation or auxin-driven venation. We propose the first three-dimensional model embracing both phenomena using a unifying mechanism of auxin transport. This integrative approach allows an assessment of our present knowledge on how auxin contributes to the early development of leaves. Our model reproduces many observations of auxin dynamics. It highlights how the inner and epidermal tissues act together to position new leaves. We also show that an additional, yet unknown, mechanism is required to attract new developing veins towards the main vasculature of the plant.",

    "abstract": "Protein-peptide interactions play an important role in major cellular processes, and are associated with several human diseases. To understand and potentially regulate these cellular function and diseases it is important to know the molecular details of the interactions. However, because of peptide flexibility and the transient nature of protein-peptide interactions, peptides are difficult to study experimentally. Thus, computational methods for predicting structural information about protein-peptide interactions are needed. Here we present InterPep, a pipeline for predicting protein-peptide interaction sites. It is a novel pipeline that, given a protein structure and a peptide sequence, utilizes structural template matches, sequence information, random forest machine learning, and hierarchical clustering to predict what region of the protein structure the peptide is most likely to bind. When tested on its ability to predict binding sites, InterPep successfully pinpointed 255 of 502 (50.7%) binding sites in experimentally determined structures at rank 1 and 348 of 502 (69.3%) among the top five predictions using only structures with no significant sequence similarity as templates. InterPep is a powerful tool for identifying peptide-binding sites; with a precision of 80% at a recall of 20% it should be an excellent starting point for docking protocols or experiments investigating peptide interactions.

Notably, transmission efficiency differs between the male and female germline, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.\\n\\nResultsHere we use high-throughput sequencing of dissected gonads to quantify sex-specific endogenous piRNAs, miRNAs and siRNAs in the C. elegans germline and the somatic gonad.

We further demonstrate that contrary to the hermaphrodite germline, the male germline, but not male soma, is resistant to environmental RNAi triggers provided by feeding. This sex-difference in silencing efficacy is associated with lower levels of gonadal RNAi amplification products. Moreover, this tissue-and sex-specific RNAi resistance is regulated by the germline, since mutant males with a feminized germline are RNAi sensitive.\\n\\nConclusionThis study provides important sex-and tissue-specific expression data of miRNA, piRNA and siRNA as well as mechanistic insights into sex-differences of gene regulation in response to environmental cues.",

Antibody repertoire diversity and its response to natural infection is poorly understood, yet is a prerequisite for molecular and structural elucidation of functionally protective immunity to viral infections. Using a swine model of mammalian viral infection, we observed marked changes following infection with the major porcine pathogen, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Deep sequencing of >516,000 light chain VJ mRNA genes showed that, similar to humans, swine utilize both lambda and kappa loci equivalently. However, V and J gene usage were highly restricted; [&ge;]99% of lambda light chains were IGLV3 and IGLV8 family members joined to IGLJ2 or IGLJ3, and 100% of kappa locus transcripts were IGKV1 or IGKV2 with only IGKJ2. Complementarity-determining region (CDR) variation was limited. Nevertheless, total diversity richness estimates were 2.3 x 105 for lambda and 1.5 x 105 for kappa, due in part to extensive germline variation in framework regions and allelic variation. Infection by PRRSV reduced total richness due to expression of several highly abundant clonal populations. Antibody light chain repertoires differed substantially among individuals, thus illustrating extensive potential variation in immune response in outbred populations. These findings demonstrate that individual variation in light chain repertoires may be an important component of variable antibody responses to infection and vaccination, and that swine are a relevant model of human antibody diversification in which the immune response capacity is critical to understanding individual variation in immune protection against disease.\\n\\nConflict of interest statementThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LI{lambda} and {kappa} light chain diversity is equivalent to heavy chain diversity\\nC_LIO_LIHigh diversity is present despite limited gene segment usage\\nC_LIO_LIPRRSV infection increases abundance of dominant {lambda} and {kappa} VJ clones\\nC_LIO_LIHigh levels of variation are present among animals\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a disease of progressive fibrosis and respiratory failure. ER stress activates a signaling pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR) that either restores homeostasis or promotes apoptosis. The bifunctional kinase/RNase IRE1 is a UPR sensor that promotes apoptosis if ER stress remains high (i.e., a \\\"terminal\\\" UPR). Using multiple small molecule inhibitors against IRE1, we show that ER stress-induced apoptosis of murine alveolar epithelial cells can be mitigated in vitro. In vivo, we show that bleomycin exposure to murine lungs causes early ER stress to activate IRE1 and the terminal UPR prior to development of pulmonary fibrosis. Small-molecule IRE1 kinase-inhibiting RNase attenuators (KIRAs) that we developed were used to evaluate the importance of IRE1 activation in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. One such KIRA--KIRA7--provided systemically to mice at the time of bleomycin exposure decreases terminal UPR signaling and prevents lung fibrosis. Administration of KIRA7 14 days after bleomycin exposure even promoted the reversal of established fibrosis. Finally, we show that KIRA8, a nanomolar-potent, monoselective KIRA compound derived from a completely different scaffold than KIRA7, likewise promoted reversal of established fibrosis. These results demonstrate that IRE1 may be a promising target in pulmonary fibrosis and that kinase inhibitors of IRE1 may eventually be developed into efficacious anti-fibrotic drugs.",

    "abstract": "A popular model of memory consolidation posits that recent memories stored in the hippocampus are reactivated during sleep and thereby transferred to neocortex for long-term storage. This process is thought to occur during sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. But whether the hippocampus consolidates all recent memories in the same manner remains unclear. An efficient memory system may extract novel information from recent experiences for preferential consolidation. In the hippocampus, memories are thought to be stored initially in CA3. Therefore, CA3 place cells that encode novel experiences may be preferentially reactivated during SWRs in subsequent sleep. To test this hypothesis, we recorded CA3 place cells in rats during exposure to a familiar and a novel environment and during subsequent overnight sleep. We found that cells that preferentially coded a novel environment showed larger firing rate increases during SWRs in NREM sleep than cells that preferentially coded a familiar environment. Moreover, CA3 place cell ensembles replayed trajectories from a novel environment during NREM sleep with higher fidelity than trajectories from a familiar environment. Together, these results suggest that CA3 representations of novel experiences are preferentially processed during subsequent sleep.",

Cardiac trabeculation is a morphogenetic process essential to form a functional ventricular wall. Here we show that zebrafish hearts lacking Crb2a, a component of the Crumbs polarity complex, display compact wall integrity defects and fail to form trabeculae. Crb2a localization is very dynamic, at a time when other cardiomyocyte junctional proteins also relocalize. Before the initiation of cardiomyocyte delamination to form the trabecular layer, Crb2a is expressed in all ventricular cardiomyocytes colocalizing with the junctional protein ZO-1. Subsequently, Crb2a becomes localized all along the apical membrane of compact layer cardiomyocytes and is downregulated by those delaminating. We show that blood flow and Nrg/ErbB2 signaling regulate these Crb2a localization changes. crb2a mutants display a multilayered wall with polarized cardiomyocytes, a unique phenotype. Our data further indicate that Crb2a regulates cardiac trabeculation by controlling the localization of tight and adherens junctions in cardiomyocytes. Importantly, transplantation data show that Crb2a controls trabeculation in a CM-autonomous manner. Altogether, our study reveals a critical role for Crb2a during cardiac development.\\n\\nSummary statementInvestigation of the Crumbs polarity protein Crb2a in zebrafish reveals a novel role in cardiac development via regulation of cell-cell adhesion and apicobasal polarity.",

However, gene expression plasticity provides the potential for organisms to respond rapidly and effectively to environmental changes, and would be favored in variable environments. In this study, we investigated the thermal stress response in Pocillopora coral colonies from two contrasting environments by exposing them to heat stress. We compared the physiological state, bacterial and Symbionaceae communities (using 16S and ITS2 metabarcoding), and gene expression levels (using RNA-Seq) between control conditions and heat stress (the temperature just below the first signs of compromised health). Colonies from both thermal regimes remained apparently normal and presented open and colored polyps during heat stress, with no change in bacterial and Symbionaceae community composition. In contrast, they differed in their transcriptomic responses. The colonies from Oman displayed a more plastic transcriptome, but some genes had a higher basal expression level (frontloading) compared to the less thermotolerant colonies from New Caledonia. In terms of biological functions, we observed an increase in the expression of stress response genes (including induction of tumor necrosis factor receptors, heat shock proteins, and detoxification of reactive oxygen species), together with a decrease in the expression of genes involved in morpho-anatomical functions. Gene regulation (transcription factors, mobile elements, histone modifications and DNA methylation) appeared to be overrepresented in the Oman colonies, indicating possible epigenetic regulation. These results show that transcriptomic plasticity and frontloading can be co-occurring processes in corals confronted to highly variable thermal regimes.",

Unicellular organisms possess arrays of highly positioned nucleosomes within their chromatin, occupying up to 80% of their genomes. These span gene-coding and regulatory regions, and can be associated with local changes of gene transcription. In the much larger genome of human cells, the roles of nucleosome positioning are less clear, and this raises questions of how nucleosome dynamics interfaces with human neurodevelopment.\\n\\nWe have generated genome-wide nucleosome maps from an undifferentiated human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) line and after its differentiation to the neuronal progenitor cell (NPC) stage. We found that approximately 3% of nucleosomes are highly positioned in NPC. In contrast, there are 8-fold less positioned nucleosomes in pluripotent cells, with the majority arising de novo or relocating during cell differentiation. Positioned nucleosomes do not directly correlate with active chromatin or gene transcription, such as marking Transcriptional Start Sites (TSS). Unexpectedly, we find a small population of nucleosomes that remain positioned after differentiation, occupying similar positions in pluripotent and NPC cells. They flank the binding sites of the key gene regulators NRSF/REST and CTCF, but remain in place whether or not their regulatory complexes are present. Together, these results present an alternative view in human cells, where positioned nucleosomes are sparse and dynamic, but act to alter gene expression at a distance via structural conformation at sites of chromatin regulation, not local changes in gene organisation.",

Previous studies on the mouse primary auditory cortex (A1) showed that neurons with preferential frequency tuning responses are mixed within local cortical regions, despite a large-scale tonotopic organization. Here we found that frequency tuning properties of marmoset A1 neurons are highly uniform within local cortical regions. We first defined tonotopic map of A1 using intrinsic optical imaging, and then used in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of large neuronal populations to examine the tonotopic preference at the single-cell level. We found that tuning preferences of layer 2/3 neurons were highly homogeneous over hundreds of micrometers in both horizontal and vertical directions. Thus, marmoset A1 neurons are distributed in a tonotopic manner at both macro- and microscopic levels. Such organization is likely to be important for the organization of auditory circuits in the primate brain.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the experiential bases of knowledge by asking whether people that perceive the world in a different way also show a different neurobiology of concepts. We characterized the brain activity of early-blind and sighted individuals during a conceptual retrieval task in which participants rated the perceptual similarity between color and action concepts evoked by spoken words. Adaptation analysis showed that word-pairs referring to perceptually similar colors (e.g., red-orange) or actions (e.g., run-jump) led to repetition-suppression in occipital visual regions in the sighted, regions that are known to encode visual features of objects and events, independently of their category. Early blind showed instead adaptation for similar concepts in language-related regions, but not in occipital cortices. Further analysis contrasting the two categories (color and action), independently of item similarity, activated category-sensitive regions in the pMTG (for actions) and the precuneus (for color) in both sighted and blind. These two regions, however, showed a different connectivity profile as a function of visual deprivation, increasing task-dependent connectivity with reorganized occipital regions in the early blind. Overall, our results show that visual deprivation changes the neural bases of conceptual retrieval, which is partially grounded in sensorimotor experience.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDo people with different sensory experience conceive the world differently? We tested whether conceptual knowledge builds on sensory experience by looking at the neurobiology of concepts in early blind individuals. Participants in fMRI heard pairs of words referring to colors (e.g., green-blue) or actions (e.g., jump-run) and rated their perceptual similarity. Perceptual similarity of colors and actions was represented in occipital visual regions in the sighted, but in language-related regions in the blind. Occipital regions in the blind, albeit not encoding perceptual similarity, were however recruited during conceptual retrieval, working in concert with classic semantic hubs such as the Precuneus and the lpMTG. Overall, visual deprivation changes the neural bases of conceptual processing, which is partially grounded in sensorimotor experience.",

    "abstract": "Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) that recapitulate the major genetic drivers in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have provided unprecedented insights into the pathogenesis of this lethal neoplasm. Nonetheless, generating an autochthonous model is an expensive, time consuming and labor intensive process, particularly when tissue specific expression or deletion of compound alleles are involved. In addition, many of the current PDAC GEMMs cause embryonic, pancreas-wide activation or loss of driver alleles, neither of which reflects the cognate human disease scenario. The advent of CRISPR/Cas9 based gene editing can potentially circumvent many of the aforementioned shortcomings of conventional breeding schema, but ensuring the efficiency of gene editing in vivo remains a challenge. Here we have developed a pipeline for generating PDAC GEMMs of complex genotypes with high efficiency using a single \\\"workhorse\\\" mouse strain expressing Cas9 in the adult pancreas under a p48 promoter. Using adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated delivery of multiplexed guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to the adult murine pancreas of p48-Cre; LSL-Cas9 mice, we confirm our ability to express an oncogenic Kras G12D allele through homology-directed repair (HDR), in conjunction with CRISPR-induced disruption of cooperating alleles (Trp53, Lkb1 and Arid1A). The resulting GEMMs demonstrate a spectrum of precursor lesions (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia [PanIN] or Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [IPMN] with eventual progression to PDAC. Next generation sequencing of the resulting murine PDAC confirms HDR of oncogenic KrasG12D allele at the endogenous locus, and insertion deletion (\\\"indel\\\") and frameshift mutations of targeted tumor suppressor alleles. By using a single \\\"workhorse\\\" mouse strain and optimal AAV serotype for in vivo gene editing with combination of driver alleles, we have created a facile autochthonous platform for interrogation of the PDAC genome.",

Late diagnoses often linked with the asymptomatic disease progression make it extremely difficult to cure.

To gain insight into mechanisms supporting a diverse ER translational landscape, we utilized BioID labeling to study the protein neighborhoods of the Sec61 translocon, specifically Sec61{beta}, an established ribosome interactor, and ER proteins (Ribophorin I, LRRC59, and Sec62) previously implicated in ribosome association. Divergent protein interactomes enriched for distinct GO functions were identified for the four reporters, within a cohort of shared interactors. Efficient BioID tagging of ribosomes was only observed for the Sec61{beta} and LRRC59 reporters. RNA-seq analyses of the Sec61{beta}- and LRRC59-labeled ribosomes revealed divergent enrichments in mRNAs and identified a transcriptome-wide role for the ER in proteome expression. These data provide evidence for a mesoscale organization of the ER and suggest that such organization provides a mechanism for the diversity of translation on the ER.",

    "abstract": "Organisms can alter morphology and behaviors in response to environmental stimuli such as mechanical forces exerted by surface conditions. The bacterium Proteus mirabilis responds to surface-based growth by enhancing cell length and degree of cell-cell interactions. Cells grow as approximately 2-micrometer rigid rods and independently swim in liquid. By contrast on hard agar surfaces, cells elongate up to 40-fold into snake-like cells that move as a collective group across the surface. Here we have elucidated that individual cell size and degree of cell-cell interactions increased across a continuous gradient that correlates with increasing agar density. We further demonstrate that interactions between the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component of the outer membrane and the immediate local environment modified these responses by reducing agar-associated barriers to motility. Loss of LPS structures corresponded with increased cell elongation on any given surface. These micrometer-scale changes to cell shape and collective interactions corresponded with centimeter-scale changes in the overall visible structure of the swarm colony. It is well-appreciated in eukaryotes that mechanical forces impact cell shape and migration. Here we propose that bacteria can also dynamically respond to the mechanical forces of surface conditions by altering cell shape, individual motility, and collective migration.",

    "abstract": "Spatial attention is discontinuous, sampling behaviorally relevant locations in theta-rhythmic cycles (3-6 Hz). Underlying this rhythmic sampling are intrinsic theta oscillations in frontal and parietal cortices that provide a clocking mechanism for two alternating attentional states that are associated with either engagement at the presently attended location (and enhanced perceptual sensitivity) or disengagement (and diminished perceptual sensitivity). It has remained unclear, however, how these theta-dependent states are coordinated across the large-scale network that directs spatial attention. The pulvinar is a candidate for such coordination, having been previously shown to regulate cortical activity. We therefore examined pulvino-cortical interactions during theta-rhythmic sampling by simultaneously recording from FEF, LIP, and the pulvinar. Neural activity propagated from (i) pulvinar to cortex during periods of engagement and (ii) from cortex to pulvinar during periods of disengagement. A rhythmic reweighting of pulvino-cortical interactions thus defines functional dissociations in the macaque attention network.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCognitive impairment is common in children with perinatally-acquired HIV (pHIV). It is not known whether exposure to HIV-related neuropathogenic mechanisms during vulnerable periods of neurodevelopment may produce distinct long-term cognitive phenotypes as children age. We used group based trajectory modeling to identify clusters of children with pHIV following a unique developmental trajectory across age and predictors of belonging to select cognitive trajectory groups.\\n\\nMethodsParticipants included children aged 1 to 17 enrolled in the PREDICT resilience study, a cohort study of children with pHIV in Thailand and Cambodia. Cognitive testing was conducted semi-annually over three years. Group based trajectory analyses determined subgroups of children with differing cognitive trajectories using maximum likelihood estimates and Bayesian statistics. Multiple logistic regression identified baseline factors associated with belonging to the lowest scoring trajectory group.\\n\\nResultsThree distinct cognitive phenotypes were identified for each neurocognitive test categorized as high, medium and low scoring groups. A subgroup of children demonstrated normal developmental patterns for Color Trails Test 1 and 2. Children in the low trajectory group were more likely to present at an older age (>8 years, OR: 2.72; p 0.01) and report lower household income level (OR: 0.33-0.42; p<0.005). Neither CD4 nadir nor treatment arm was associated with cognitive trajectory status.\\n\\nConclusionOur study reflects the benefit of using group based trajectory modeling to classify the heterogeneity in cognitive outcomes of children with pHIV. Children were described as belonging to three distinct subgroups determined at study onset alluding to the fact that cognitive outcomes are likely to be determined at an early age with little variability over time in children with pHIV. Demographic variables, including older age at presentation and household income, were associated with low scoring cognitive trajectories, whereas HIV related variables were not. These findings mirror other studies and demonstrate the impact of socioeconomic factors on cognitive development in children with pHIV.",

    "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) is a major cause of disability and is not effectively managed in half of the patients. We investigated whether mechanical vibration could reduce tremor in ET by selectively recruiting afferent pathways. We used piezoelectric actuators to deliver vibratory stimuli to the hand and forearm during long trials (4 min), while we monitored the tremor using inertial sensors. We analyzed the effect of four stimulation strategies, including different constant and variable vibration frequencies, in 18 ET patients. Although there was not a clear homogeneous response to vibration across patients and strategies, in most cases (50-72%) mechanical vibration was associated with an increase in the amplitude of their tremor. In contrast, the tremor was reduced in 5-22% of the patients, depending on the strategy. However, these results are hard to interpret given the intrinsic variability of the tremor: during equally long trials without vibration, the tremor changed significantly in 67% of the patients (increased in 45%; decreased in 22%). We conclude that mechanical vibration of the limb does not have a systematic effect on tremor in ET. Moreover, the observed intrinsic variability of the tremor should be taken into account when designing future experiments to assess tremor in ET and how it responds to any intervention.",

    "abstract": "Characterization of Human Endogenous Retrovirus (HERV) expression within the transcriptomic landscape using RNA-seq is complicated by uncertainty in fragment assignment because of sequence similarity. We present Telescope, a computational software tool that provides accurate estimation of transposable element expression (retrotranscriptome) resolved to specific genomic locations. Telescope directly addresses uncertainty in fragment assignment by reassigning ambiguously mapped fragments to the most probable source transcript as determined within a Bayesian statistical model. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through single locus analysis of HERV expression in 13 ENCODE cell types. When examined at this resolution, we find that the magnitude and breadth of the retrotranscriptome can be vastly different among cell types. Furthermore, our approach is robust to differences in sequencing technology, and demonstrates that the retrotranscriptome has potential to be used for cell type identification. Telescope performs highly accurate quantification of the retrotranscriptomic landscape in RNA-seq experiments, revealing a differential complexity in the transposable element biology of complex systems not previously observed. Telescope is available at github.com/mlbendall/telescope.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAlmost half of the human genome is composed of Transposable elements (TEs), but their contribution to the transcriptome, their cell-type specific expression patterns, and their role in disease remains poorly understood. Recent studies have found many elements to be actively expressed and involved in key cellular processes. For example, human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are reported to be involved in human embryonic stem cell differentiation. Discovering which exact HERVs are differentially expressed in RNA-seq data would be a major advance in understanding such processes. However, because HERVs have a high level of sequence similarity it is hard to identify which exact HERV is differentially expressed. To solve this problem, we developed a computer program which addressed uncertainty in fragment assignment by reassigning ambiguously mapped fragments to the most probable source transcript as determined within a Bayesian statistical model. We call this program, \\\"Telescope\\\". We then used Telescope to identify HERV expression in 13 well-studied cell types from the ENCODE consortium and found that different cell types could be characterized by enrichment for different HERV families, and for locus specific expression. We also showed that Telescope performed better than other methods currently used to determine TE expression. The use of this computational tool to examine new and existing RNA-seq data sets may lead to new understanding of the roles of TEs in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "To initiate the infectious process, many viruses enter their host cells by triggering endocytosis following receptor engagement. The mechanism by which non-enveloped viruses, such as the caliciviruses, escape the endosome is however poorly understood. The Caliciviridae include many important human and animal pathogens, most notably norovirus, the cause of winter vomiting disease. Here we show that VP2, a minor capsid protein encoded by all caliciviruses, forms a large portal assembly at a unique three-fold symmetry axis following receptor engagement. This feature surrounds an open pore in the capsid shell. We hypothesise that the VP2 portal complex is the means by which the virus escapes the endosome, pene-trating the endosomal membrane to release the viral genome into the cytoplasm. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) and asymmetric reconstruction were used to investigate structural changes in the capsid of feline calicivirus (FCV) that occur when the virus binds to its cellular receptor junctional adhesion molecule-A (fJAM-A). Near atomic-resolution structures were calculated for the native virion alone and decorated with soluble receptor fragments. We present atomic models of the major capsid protein VP1 in the presence and absence of fJAM-A, revealing the contact interface and conformational changes brought about by the interaction. Furthermore, we have calculated an atomic model of the portal protein VP2 and revealed the structural changes in VP1 that lead to pore formation. While VP2 was known to be critical for the production of infectious virus, its function has been hitherto undetermined. Our finding that VP2 assembles a portal that is likely responsible for endosome escape represents a major step forward in our understanding of both the Caliciviridae and icosahedral RNA containing viruses in general.",

These decisions are modulated by different factors, such as environmental conditions (temperature, relative humidity) and sociality (groups size, nature of communications). The aim of this study is to establish the interplay between environmental conditions and the modulation of the interactions between individuals within a group leading to an inversion of preferences. We show that the preferences of isolated cockroaches and groups of 16 individuals, on the selection of the relative humidity of a shelter are inversed and shed light on the mechanisms involved. We suggest that the relative humidity has a multi-level influence on cockroaches, manifested as an attractant effect at the individual level and as a negative effect at the group level, modulating the interactions.",

    "abstract": "Starting from a parentalE. coli K-12 MG1655 strain, we evolve cells in five different carbon environments-glucose, arabinose, xylose, rhamnose, and a mixture of these four sugars (in a predefined ratio) for approximately 2,000 generations. At the end of the adaptation period, we quantify and compare growth dynamics of the strains in a variety of environments. The evolved strains show no specialized adaptation towards growth in the carbon medium in which they were evolved. Rather, in all environments, the evolved strains exhibited a reduced lag phase and an increased growth rate. Sequencing results reveal that these dynamical properties are not introduced via mutations in the precise loci associated with utilization of the sugar in which the bacterium was evolved in. These phenotypic changes are rather likely introduced via mutationselsewhere onthe genome. Sugar systems are known to exhibit hierarchy in utilization. Evolution in a defined environment, in our experimental framework, does not alter this hierarchy.",

    "abstract": "Pericentromeric satellite repeats are enriched in 5-methylcytosine (5mC). Loss of 5mC at these sequences is common in cancer and is a hallmark of Immunodeficiency, Centromere and Facial abnormalities (ICF) syndrome. While the general importance of 5mC is well-established, the specific functions of 5mC at pericentromeres are less clear. To address this deficiency, we generated a viable animal model of pericentromeric hypomethylation through mutation of the ICF-gene ZBTB24. Deletion of zebrafish zbtb24 caused a progressive loss of 5mC at pericentromeres and ICF-like phenotypes. Hypomethylation of these repeats triggered derepression of pericentromeric transcripts and activation of an interferon-based innate immune response. Injection of pericentromeric RNA is sufficient to elicit this response in wild-type embryos, and mutation of the MDA5-MAVS dsRNA-sensing machinery blocks the response in mutants. These findings identify activation of the innate immune system as an early consequence of pericentromeric hypomethylation, implicating derepression of pericentromeric transcripts as a trigger of autoimmunity.",

Effector protein identification in oomycetes relies on identification of open reading frames with certain amino acid motifs among additional minor criteria. To date, identification of effectors relies on custom scripts to identify motifs in candidate open reading frames. Here, we developed the R package effectR that provides a convenient tool for rapid prediction of effectors in oomycete genomes, or with custom scripts for any genome, in a reproducible way. The effectR package relies on a combination of regular expressions statements and hidden Markov model approaches to predict candidate RxLR and CRN effectors. Other custom motifs for novel effectors can easily be implemented and added to package updates. The effectR package has been validated with published oomycete genomes.

However, some of the most consequential evolutionary changes, such as, for example, the emergence of major taxa, seem to occur abruptly rather than gradually, as captured in the concepts of punctuated equilibrium 3,4 and evolutionary transitions 5,6. We examine a mathematical model of an evolutionary process on a rugged fitness landscape 7,8 and obtain analytic solutions for the probability of multi-mutational leaps, that is, several mutations occurring simultaneously, within a single generation in one genome, and being fixed all together in the evolving population. The results indicate that, for typical, empirically observed combinations of the parameters of the evolutionary process, namely, effective population size, mutation rate, and distribution of selection coefficients of mutations, the probability of a multi-mutational leap is low, and accordingly, their contribution to the evolutionary process is minor at best. However, such leaps could become an important factor of evolution in situations of population bottlenecks and elevated mutation rates, such as stress-induced mutagenesis in microbes or tumor progression, as well as major evolutionary transitions and evolution of primordial replicators.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVaricella zoster virus (VZV) is a human pathogenic alphaherpesvirus harboring a relatively large DNA molecule. The VZV transcriptome has already been analyzed by microarray and short-read sequencing analyses. However, both approaches have substantial limitations when used for structural characterization of transcript isoforms, even if supplemented with primer extension or other techniques. Among others, they are inefficient in distinguishing between embedded RNA molecules, transcript isoforms, including splice and length variants, as well as between alternative polycistronic transcripts. It has been demonstrated in several studies that long-read sequencing is able to circumvent these problems.\\n\\nResultsIn this work, we report the analysis of VZV lytic transcriptome using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing platform. These investigations have led to the identification of 114 novel transcripts, including mRNAs, non-coding RNAs, polycistronic RNAs and complex transcripts, as well as 10 novel spliced transcripts and 27 novel transcription start site isoforms and transcription end site isoforms. A novel class of transcripts, the nroRNAs are described in this study. These transcripts are encoded by the genomic region located in close vicinity to the viral replication origin. We also show that the VZV latency transcript (VLT) exhibits a more complex structural variation than formerly believed. Additionally, we have detected RNA editing in a novel non-coding RNA molecule.\\n\\nConclusionsOur investigations disclosed a composite transcriptomic architecture of VZV, including the discovery of novel RNA molecules and transcript isoforms, as well as a complex meshwork of transcriptional read-throughs and overlaps. The results represent a substantial advance in the annotation VZV transcriptome and in understanding the molecular biology of the herpesviruses in general.",

    "abstract": "Influenza viruses are notorious pathogens that frequently cross the species barrier with often severe consequences for both animal and human health. In 2011, a novel member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, Influenza D virus (IDV), was identified in the respiratory tract of pigs with influenza-like symptoms and subsequently also in cattle, a species that previously never was associated with influenza virus infection. Epidemiological surveys among livestock demonstrated that IDV is worldwide distributed among ruminants, but the most striking observation is the detection of IDV-directed antibodies among humans with occupational exposure to livestock. As a first step toward identifying the zoonotic potential of the newly emerging IDV we determined the replication kinetics and cell tropism at the primary site of replication using an in vitro respiratory epithelium model of humans. The inoculation of IDV on human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) cultures revealed efficient replication kinetics and apical progeny virus release of IDV at different body temperatures. Intriguingly, the replication characteristics of IDV revealed many similarities to the human-associated Influenza C virus, including the predominant cell tropism for ciliated cells. Moreover, analysis of the host response during IDV infection revealed only a pronounced upregulation of Type III interferon (IFN) transcripts. Nevertheless, viral progeny virus is replication competent and can be efficiently sub-passaged in hAEC cultures from different donors. Highlighting, that there is no intrinsic impairment of IDV replication within the human respiratory epithelium and might explain why IDV-directed antibodies can be detected among humans with occupational exposure to livestock.\\n\\nImportanceInfluenza viruses are notorious pathogens that frequently cross the species barrier with often severe consequences for both animal and human health.

To compensate for this variability, decision-making neural circuits adapt to the current behavioral context. In orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), neurons encode the subjective value of offered and chosen goods in a quasi-linear way. Previous work found that the gain of the encoding is lower when the value range is wider. However, previous studies did not disambiguate between neurons adapting to the value range or to the maximum value. Furthermore, they did not examine changes in baseline activity. Here we investigated how neurons in the macaque OFC adapt to changes in the value distribution. We found that neurons adapt to both the maximum and the minimum value, but only partially. Concurrently, the baseline response is higher when the minimum value is larger. Using a simulated decision circuit, we showed that higher baseline activity increases choice variability, and thus lowers the expected payoff in high value contexts.",

The fungal genus Aspergillus contains important pathogens of humans, model organisms, and microbial cell factories. Aspergillus niger is used to produce organic acids, proteins, and is a promising source of new bioactive secondary metabolites. Out of the 14,165 open reading frames predicted in the A. niger genome of only 2% have been experimentally verified and over 6,000 are hypothetical. Here we show that gene co-expression network analysis can be used to overcome this limitation. A meta-analysis of 155 transcriptomics experiments generated co-expression networks for 9,579 genes ([~]65%) of the A. niger genome. By populating this dataset with over 1,200 gene functional experiments from the genus Aspergillus and performing gene ontology enrichment, we could infer biological processes for 9,263 of A. niger genes, including 2,970 hypothetical genes. Experimental validation of selected co-expression sub-networks uncovered four transcription factors involved in secondary metabolite synthesis, which were used to activate production of multiple natural products. This study constitutes a significant step towards systems-level understanding of A. niger, and the datasets can be used to fuel discoveries of model systems, fungal pathogens, and biotechnology.",

Traditionally, objects are thought to be attentionally selected and committed to short-term memory one-by-one. However, few studies directly test this serial encoding assumption. Here, we demonstrate that information from separate objects can be encoded into short-term memory in parallel. We developed models of serial and parallel encoding that describe probabilities of items being present in short-term memory throughout the encoding process, and tested them in a whole-report design. Empirical data from four experiments in healthy individuals were fitted best by the parallel encoding model, even when items were presented unilaterally (processed within one hemisphere). Our results demonstrate that information from several items can be attentionally selected and consequently encoded into short-term memory simultaneously. This suggests the popular feature integration theory needs to be reformulated to account for parallel encoding, and provides important boundaries for computational models of short-term memory.",

This property may be invoked by a physical stimulus (temperature, radiation) or by a chemical ligand, and may occur through mapping of the protein external environment onto a subset of protein conformers. We have stimulated with temperature cycles two partners of an immune complex before and after assembly, and revealed that properties of the external stimulus (period, phase) are also found in the characteristics of the immune complex (i.e. periodic variations in the binding affinity).

    "abstract": "The in vitro motility assay is a valuable tool to understand motor protein mechanics, but existing algorithms are not optimized for accurate time resolution. We propose an algorithm that combines trace detection with a time-stamped analysis. By tracking filament ends, we minimize data loss from overlapping and crossing filaments. A movement trace formed by each filament end is created by time-stamping when the filament either first (filament tip) or last (filament tail) occupies a pixel. A frame number vs distance curve is generated from this trace, which is segmented into regions by slope to detect stop-and-go movement. We show, using generated mock motility videos, accurate detection of velocity and motile fraction changes for velocities <0.05 pixels per frame, without manual trace dropping and regardless of filament crossings. Compared with established algorithms we show greatly improved accuracy in velocity and motile fraction estimation, with greatly reduced user effort. We tested two actual motility experiments: 1) Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) added to skeletal myosin in rigor; 2) myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) added to phasic smooth muscle myosin. Our algorithm revealed previously undetectable features: 1) rapid increase in motile fraction paralleled by a slow increase in velocity as ATP concentration increases; 2) simultaneous reductions in velocity and motile fraction as MLCP diffuses into the motility chamber at very low velocities. Our algorithm surpasses existing algorithms in the resolution of time dependent changes in motile fraction and velocity at a wide range of filament lengths and velocities, with minimal user input and CPU time.",

    "abstract": "The need to provide transparent and reliable Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission estimates is strongly emphasized in the context of international reporting under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UN-FCCC) and the Paris Agreement. Yet it is difficult to find specific guidance about what information is really needed to evaluate the quality of the emission factors or activity data used for GHG emission estimates. The most commonly used indicator of the reliability of an estimation procedure (and one of the few indicators explicitly mentioned in the 2006 IPCC guidelines) is the so-called confidence interval, usually at a confidence level of 90% or 95%. This interval, however, is unlikely to be a meaningful indicator of the quality of the estimate, if not associated with additional information about the estimation and survey procedures (such as on the sampling design, measurement protocols or quality control routines, among others). We provide a review of the main sources of error that can have an impact on the precision and accuracy of the estimation of both emission factors and activity data and a list of the essential survey features that should be reported to properly evaluate the quality of a GHG emission estimate. Such list is also applicable to the reporting of national forest inventories and of area estimation of activity data, and includes the case in which confidence intervals are obtained using error propagation techniques.",

    "abstract": "Analysis by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) can identify and quantify thousands of proteins in microgram-level samples, such as those comprised of thousands of cells. This process, however, remains challenging for smaller samples, such as the proteomes of single mammalian cells, because reduced protein levels reduce the number of confidently sequenced peptides. To alleviate this reduction, we developed Data-driven Alignment of Retention Times for IDentification (DART-ID). This method implements global retention time (RT) alignment to infer peptide RTs across experiments. DART-ID then incor-porates the global RT-estimates within a principled Bayesian framework to increase the confidence in correct peptide-spectrum-matches and decrease confidence in incorrect peptide-spectrum-matches. Applying DART-ID to hundreds of monocyte and T-cell samples pre-pared by the Single Cell Proteomics by Mass Spectrometry (SCoPE-MS) design increased the number of data points by 30 - 50% at 1% FDR, and thus decreased missing data. Quantification benchmarks indicate excellent quantification of peptides upgraded by DART-ID and support their utility for downstream analysis, such as identifying cell types and cell-type specific proteins. The additional datapoints provided by DART-ID boost the statistical power and double the number of proteins identified as differentially abundant in monocytes and T-cells. DART-ID can be applied to diverse experimental designs and is freely available at http://github.com/SlavovLab/DART-ID.\n\nAuthor SummaryIdentifying and quantifying proteins in single cells gives researchers the ability to tackle complex biological problems that involve single cell heterogeneity, such as the treatment of solid tumors. Mass spectrometry analysis of peptides can identify their sequence from their masses and the masses of their fragment ion, but often times these pieces of evidence are insufficient for a confident peptide identification. This problem is exacerbated when analyzing lowly abundant samples such as single cells. To identify even peptides with weak mass spectra, DART-ID incorporates their retention time - the time when they elute from the liquid chromatography used to physically separate them. We present both a novel method of aligning the retention times of peptides across experiments, as well as a rigorous framework for using the estimated retention times to enhance peptide sequence identification. Incorporating the retention time as additional evidence leads to a substantial increase in the number of samples in which proteins are confidently identified and quantified.",

The interaction of two cisplatin-like dinuclear Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes with DNA was studied through a multidisciplinary experimental approach, using quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) techniques coupled to synchrotron-based extended X-ray absorption fine structure (SR-EXAFS) and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy-Attenuated Total Reflectance (SR-FTIR-ATR). The drug impact on DNAs dynamical profile, via its hydration layer, was provided by QENS, a drug-triggered enhanced mobility having been revealed. Additionally, an onset of anharmonicity was detected for dehydrated DNA, at room temperature. Far- and mid-infrared measurements allowed the first simultaneous detection of the drugs and its primary pharmacological target, as well as the drug-prompted changes in DNAs conformation that mediate cytotoxicity in DNA extracted from drug-exposed human triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), a low prognosis type of cancer.

    "abstract": "Proteins trace trajectories in sequence space as their amino acids become substituted by other amino acids. The number of substitutions per unit time, the rate of evolution, varies among sites because of biophysical constraints. Several properties that characterize sites local environments have been proposed as biophysical determinants of site-specific evolutionary rates. Thus, rate increases with increasing solvent exposure, increasing flexibility, and decreasing local packing density. For enzymes, rate increases also with increasing distance from the proteins active residues, presumably due to functional constraints. The dependence of rates on solvent accessibility, packing density, and flexibility has been mechanistically explained in terms of selection for stability. However, as I show here, a stability-based model fails to reproduce the observed rate-distance dependence, overestimating rates close to the active residues and underestimating rates of distant sites. Here, I pose a new biophysical model of enzyme evolution with selection for stability and activity (MSA) and compare it with a stability-based counterpart (MS). Testing these models on a structurally and functionally diverse dataset of monomeric enzymes, I found that MSA fits observed rates better than MS for most proteins. While both models reproduce the observed dependence of rates on solvent accessibility, packing, and flexibility, MSA fits these dependencies somewhat better. Importantly, while MS fails to reproduce the dependence of rates on distance from the active residues, MSA accounts for the rate-distance dependence quantitatively. Thus, the variation of evolutionary rate among enzyme sites is mechanistically underpinned by natural selection for both stability and activity.",

    "abstract": "1MotivationGenotype imputation, though generally accurate, often results in many genotypes being poorly imputed, particularly in studies where the individuals are not well represented by standard reference panels. When individuals in the study share regions of the genome identical by descent (IBD), it is possible to use this information in combination with a study specific reference panel (SSRP) to improve the imputation results. Kinpute uses IBD information--due to either recent, familial relatedness or distant, unknown ancestors-- in conjunction with the output from linkage disequilibrium (LD) based imputation methods to compute more accurate genotype probabilities. Kinpute uses a novel method for IBD imputation, which works even in the absence of a pedigree, and results in substantially improved imputation quality.\n\nResultsGiven initial estimates of average IBD between subjects in the study sample, Kinpute uses a novel algorithm to select an optimal set of individuals to sequence and use as an SSRP. Kinpute is designed to use as input both this SSRP and the genotype probabilities output from other LD based imputation software, and uses a new method to combine the LD imputed genotype probabilities with IBD configurations to substantially improve imputation. We tested Kinpute on a human population isolate where 98 individuals have been sequenced. In half of this sample, whose sequence data was masked, we used Impute2 to perform LD based imputation and Kinpute was used to obtain higher accuracy genotype probabilities. Measures of imputation accuracy improved significantly, particularly for those genotypes that Impute2 imputed with low certainty.\n\nAvailabilityKinpute is an open-source and freely available C++ software package that can be downloaded from https://github.com/markabney/Kinpute/releases.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is a leading cause of health care-associated infections. Although significant progress has been made in the understanding of its genome, the epigenome of C. difficile and its functional impact has not been systematically explored. Here, we performed the first comprehensive DNA methylome analysis of C. difficile using 36 human isolates and observed great epigenomic diversity. We discovered an orphan DNA methyltransferase with a well-defined specificity whose corresponding gene is highly conserved across our dataset and in all ~300 global C. difficile genomes examined. Inactivation of the methyltransferase gene negatively impacted sporulation, a key step in C. difficile disease transmission, consistently supported by multi-omics data, genetic experiments, and a mouse colonization model. Further experimental and transcriptomic analysis also suggested that epigenetic regulation is associated with cell length, biofilm formation, and host colonization. These findings open up a new epigenetic dimension to characterize medically relevant biological processes in this critical pathogen. This work also provides a set of methods for comparative epigenomics and integrative analysis, which we expect to be broadly applicable to bacterial epigenomics studies.",

    "abstract": "A marked decrease in parvalbumin (PV), a calcium-binding protein specific to a subset of GABAergic neurons, is a consistent finding in postmortem schizophrenic brain tissue. This reduction is selective to PV and is regionally specific: occurring primarily in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (HPC) of patients. Rodent models of NMDA receptor hypofunction utilizing NMDA antagonist treatments - e.g. ketamine (KET) - show schizophrenia-like cognitive and behavioral impairments with parallel changes in PV. While decreased PV is considered a hallmark of neuropathology in schizophrenia, previous work elucidating the effects of KET administration on PV are contradictory, with findings suggesting decreased, increased, or no change in PV expression. Upon close examination of the procedures used across studies, there are two primary inconsistencies, including: 1) the age of animals used; and 2) the timeline of post-treatment tissue collection. To better understand whether these key differences impact observed PV changes, the present study investigated the impact of age and time of sacrifice on chronic KET-induced PV changes in the neocortex and HPC. Our findings suggest an effect of age, but not sacrifice timeline, on PV cell count following 14 days of sub-anesthetic KET treatment. We provide evidence that 1-month-old rats exhibit significant KET-induced HPC PV decreases, while adult rats show a modest increase in HPC PV following chronic KET. Taken together, we propose that PV is a dynamic marker, and that changes in cell counts - and their interpretation - following NDMA antagonist treatment should be considered in the context of age.",

    "abstract": "The sparse coding model posits that the visual system has evolved to efficiently code natural stimuli using a sparse set of features from an overcomplete dictionary. The classic sparse coding model suffers from two key limitations, however: (1) computing the neural response to an image patch requires minimizing a nonlinear objective function, which was initially not easily mapped onto a neurally plausible feedforward mechanism and (2) fitting the model to data relied on an approximate inference method that ignores uncertainty. Here we address these two shortcomings by formulating a variational inference method for the sparse coding model inspired by the variational auto-encoder (VAE) framework. The sparse-coding variational auto-encoder (SVAE) augments the classic sparse coding model with a probabilistic recognition model, parametrized by a deep neural network. This recognition model provides a neurally plausible implementation for the mapping from image patches to neural activities, and enables a principled method for fitting the sparse coding model to data via maximization of the evidence lower bound (ELBO). The SVAE differs from the traditional VAE in three important ways: the generative model is the sparse coding model instead of a deep network; the latent representation is overcomplete, with more latent dimensions than image pixels; and the prior over latent variables is a sparse or heavy-tailed instead of Gaussian. We fit the SVAE to natural image data under different assumed prior distributions, and show that it obtains higher test performance than previous fitting methods. Finally, we examine the response properties of the recognition network and show that it captures important nonlinear properties of neurons in the early visual pathway.",

As a consequence of developmental changes, DNA methylation profiles derived from adult white blood cells are poor references for prediction of cord blood cell types from DNA methylation data. We thus examined cell-type specific differences in DNA methylation in leukocyte subsets between cord and adult blood, and assessed the impact of these differences on prediction of cell types in cord blood.\\n\\nResultsThough all cell types showed differences between cord and adult blood, some specific patterns stood out that reflected how the immune system changes after birth. In cord blood, lymphoid cells showed less variability than in adult, potentially demonstrating their naive status. In fact, cord CD4 and CD8 T cells were so similar that genetic effects on DNA methylation were greater than cell type effects in our analysis, and CD8 T cell frequencies remained difficult to predict, even after optimizing the library used for cord blood composition estimation. Myeloid cells showed fewer changes between cord and adult and also less variability, with monocytes showing the fewest sites of DNA methylation change between cord and adult. Finally, including nucleated red blood cells in the reference library was necessary for accurate cell type predictions in cord blood.\\n\\nConclusionChanges in DNA methylation with age were highly cell type specific, and those differences paralleled what is known about the maturation of the postnatal immune system.",

    "abstract": "While work in temperate forests suggests that there may be consistent differences in plant-soil feedback (PSF) between plants with arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal associations, it is unclear whether this is compatible with the high diversity of tropical rainforests. To examine this, we tested the effect of mycorrhizal type, phylogenetic distance, and soil fertility on variation in PSF strength in a mixed-tropical rainforest with a uniquely high diversity of ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal trees. We found positive phylogenetic PSFs for ectomycorrhizal tree species that were insensitive to soil fertility. By contrast, PSFs for arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species were negative, and increasingly so with greater soil fertility. Our results demonstrate consistent effects of mycorrhizal types on plant population dynamics across biomes, and help explain biogeographic variation across tropical forests, such as familial dominance of the Dipterocarpaceae in SE Asia. However, they also raise questions about the role of PSFs in maintaining tropical diversity.\\n\\nStatement of authorshipRMS, SER, SJD and KGP designed the experiment. RMS conducted the experiment and collected data. RMS analyzed data with input from KGP and SER.

    "abstract": "Intestinal epithelium development depends on epigenetic modifications, but whether that is also the case for other intestinal tract cell types remains unclear. We found that functional loss of a DNA methylation machinery component, ubiquitin-like protein containing PHD and RING finger domains 1 (uhrf1), leads to reduced enteric neuron number, changes in neuronal morphology, and severe intestinal smooth muscle disruption. Genetic chimeras revealed that Uhrf1 functions both cell-autonomously in enteric neuron progenitors and cell-non-autonomously in surrounding intestinal cells. Uhrf1 recruits the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 to unmethylated DNA during replication. Dnmt1 is also expressed in enteric neuron and smooth muscle progenitors. dnmt1 mutants show a strong reduction in enteric neuron number and disrupted intestinal smooth muscle. Because dnmt1;uhrf1 double mutants have a similar phenotype to dnmt1 and uhrf1 single mutants, Dnmt1 and Uhrf1 must function together during enteric neuron and intestinal muscle development. This work shows that genes controlling epigenetic modifications are important in coordinating intestinal tract development, provides the first demonstration that these genes are important in ENS development, and advances uhrf1 and dnmt1 as potential new Hirschsprung disease candidates.\\n\\nSummaryThis work provides evidence that DNA methylation factors are important in all cell types that contribute to development of a functional intestine.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIntracranial photometry through chronically implanted optical fibers is a widely adopted technique for measuring signals from fluorescent probes in deep-brain structures. The recent proliferation of bright, photo-stable, and specific genetically-encoded fluorescent reporters for calcium and for other neuromodulators has greatly increased the utility and popularity of this technique.\\n\\nNew MethodHere we describe an open-source, cost-effective, microcontroller-based solution for controlling optical components in an intracranial photometry system and processing the resulting signal.\\n\\nResultsWe show proof-of-principle that this system supports high quality intracranial photometry recordings from dorsal striatum in freely moving mice. A single system supports simultaneous fluorescence measurements in two independent color channels, but multiple systems can be integrated together if additional fluorescence channels are required. This system is designed to work in combination with either commercially available or custom-built optical components. Parts can be purchased for less than one tenth the cost of commercially available alternatives and complete assembly takes less than one day for an inexperienced user.\\n\\nComparison with Existing Method(s)Currently available hardware draws on a variety of commercial, custom-built, or hybrid elements for both optical and electronic components. Many of these hardware systems are either specialized and inflexible, or over-engineered and expensive.\\n\\nConclusionsThis open-source system increases experimental flexibility while reducing cost relative to current commercially available components. All software and firmware are open-source and customizable, affording a degree of experimental flexibility that is not available in current commercial systems.",

    "abstract": "Breast carcinomas are characterized by anomalous gene regulatory programs. As is well known, gene expression programs are able to shape phenotypes. Hence, the understanding of gene co-expression may shed light on the underlying mechanisms behind the transcriptional regulatory programs affecting tumor development and evolution. For instance, in breast cancer, there is a clear loss of inter-chromosomal (trans-) co-expression, compared with healthy tissue. At the same time cis- (intra-chromosomal) interactions are favored in breast tumors. In order to have a deeper understanding of regulatory phenomena in cancer, here, we constructed Gene Co-expression Networks by using 848 RNA-seq whole-genome samples corresponding to the four breast cancer molecular subtypes, as well as healthy tissue. We quantify the cis-/trans- co-expression imbalance in all phenotypes. Additionally, we measured the association between co-expression and physical distance between genes, and characterized the proportion of intra/inter-cytoband interactions per phenotype. We confirmed loss of trans- co-expression in all molecular subtypes. We also observed that gene cisco-expression decays abruptly with distance in all tumors in contrast with healthy tissue. We observed co-expressed gene hotspots, that tend to be connected at cytoband regions, and coincide accurately with already known copy number altered regions, such as Chr17q12, or Chr8q24.3 for all subtypes. Our methodology recovered different alterations already reported for specific breast cancer subtypes, showing how co-expression network approaches might help to capture distinct events that modify the cell regulatory program.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) are responsible for synthesizing proteins that are essential for oxidative phosphorylation or energy (ATP) generation. Despite their proposed bacterial origin, the composition and structure of the human mitoribosome and its translational factors are dramatically different from their bacterial counterparts. The mammalian mitoribosome recycling factor (RRFmt) carries a mito-specific N-terminus extension (NTE), which is necessary for the function of RRFmt. Here we present a 3.7 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of the human 55S mitoribosome-RRFmt complex, which reveals -helix and loop structures for a portion of the NTE that makes multiple mito-specific interactions with functionally critical regions of the mitoribosome. These include ribosomal RNAs segments that constitute the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), those that connect PTC with the GTPase-associated center, and with multiple mitoribosomal proteins. Our structure also reveals novel conformational changes in mitoribosome due to RRFmt binding. Together, these findings help understand the unique features of mitoribosome recycling.",
