    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in budding yeast is biparentally inherited, but colonies rapidly lose one type of parental mtDNA, becoming homoplasmic. Therefore, hybrids between different yeast species possess two homologous nuclear genomes, but only one type of mitochondrial DNA. We hypothesise that the choice of mtDNA retention is influenced by its contribution to hybrid fitness in different environments, and that the allelic expression of the two nuclear sub-genomes is affected by the presence of different mtDNAs in hybrids. Here, we crossed Saccharomyces cerevisiae with S. uvarum under different environmental conditions and examined the plasticity of the retention of mtDNA in each hybrid. We showed that on fermentable carbon sources at warm temperatures each parental mtDNA was equally likely to be retained, while at colder temperatures, hybrids preferentially retained mtDNA derived from S. uvarum. On a non-fermentable carbon source, hybrids retained S. cerevisiae mtDNA, independent of temperature. By acquiring transcriptome data and co-expression profiles for hybrids harbouring different mtDNA in a selection of environments, we found a clear pattern of concerted allelic transcription of one or the other sub-genome for specific biological pathways, supporting the notion that the hybrid cell works preferentially with one set of parental alleles or the other according to specific cellular functions. We argue that the type of mtDNA retained in hybrids affects the expression of the nuclear genome and the organism fitness in different environments, and therefore may have a role in driving the evolution of the hybrid nuclear genome in terms of gene retention and loss.",

    "abstract": "Arthropod Mycoplasma are little known endosymbionts in insects, primarily known as plant disease vectors. Mycoplasma in other arthropods such as arachnids are unknown. We report the first complete Mycoplasma genome sequenced, identified, and annotated from a scorpion, Centruroides vittatus, and designate it as Mycoplasma vittatus. We find the genome is at least a 683,827 bp single circular chromosome with a GC content of 43.7% and with 1,010 protein-coding genes. The putative virulence determinants include 20 genes associated with the virulence operon associated with protein synthesis (SSU ribosomal proteins) and nine genes with fluoroquinolone resistance. Comparative analysis revealed that the M. vittatus genome is smaller than other Mycoplasma genomes and exhibits a higher GC content. Phylogenetic analysis shows M. vittatus as part of the Hominis group of Mycoplasma. As arthropod genomes accumulate, further novel Mycoplasma genomes may be identified and characterized.",

    "abstract": "A defining feature of centromeres is the presence of the histone H3 variant CENP-A that replaces H3 in a subset of centromeric nucleosomes. In Drosophila cultured cells CENP-A deposition at centromeres takes place during the metaphase stage of the cell cycle and strictly depends on the presence of its specific chaperone CAL1. How CENP-A loading is restricted to mitosis is unknown. We found that CAL1 interacts with the spindle assembly checkpoint protein and RZZ complex component Zw10 and thus constitutes the anchor for the recruitment of RZZ. We identify Zw10 as determinant of a mitotic duration and show that it is inversely correlated with CENP-A levels at centromeres. Moreover, overexpression of CAL1 is associated with increased CENP-A levels at centromeres and completely uncouples CENP-A loading from mitosis. Therefore CAL1 controls CENP-A incorporation at centromeres both quantitatively and temporally, connecting it to the spindle assembly checkpoint to further ensure mitotic fidelity.",

Within Labrador, the Arctic and Atlantic lineages were widespread. Two locations (one landlocked and one with access to the sea) also contained individuals of the Acadian lineage, constituting the first record of this lineage in Labrador. Atlantic and Acadian lineage individuals were found in both eastern and western Newfoundland. Multiple sampling locations in Newfoundland and Labrador contained fish of two or more different glacial lineages, implying their introgression. Glacial lineage did not appear to dictate contemporary genetic divergence between the pale and dark morph of char present in Gander Lake, Newfoundland. Both were predominately of the Atlantic lineage, suggesting the potential for their divergence in sympatry. This study reveals Newfoundland and Labrador to be a unique junction of three glacial lineages which have likely hybridized extensively in this region.",

    "abstract": "The Sae2/CtIP protein is required for efficient processing of DNA double-strand breaks that initiate homologous recombination in eukaryotic cells. Sae2/CtIP is also important for survival of single-stranded Top1-induced lesions and CtIP is known to associate directly with transcription-associated complexes in mammalian cells. Here we investigate the role of Sae2/CtIP at single-strand lesions in budding yeast and in human cells and find that depletion of Sae2/CtIP promotes the accumulation of stalled RNA polymerase and RNA-DNA hybrids at sites of highly expressed genes. Overexpression of the RNA-DNA helicase Senataxin suppresses DNA damage sensitivity and R-loop accumulation in Sae2/CtIP-deficient cells, and a catalytic mutant of CtIP fails to complement this sensitivity, indicating a role for CtIP nuclease activity in the repair process. Based on this evidence, we propose that R-loop processing by 5 flap endonucleases is a necessary step in the stabilization and removal of nascent R-loop initiating structures in eukaryotic cells.",

Comparisons of healthy (grade 0), early OA (grades I-II), and late OA (grades III-IV) donor populations were considered to reveal phenotypes throughout disease progression.\\n\\nResultsGlobal metabolomic profiles in synovial fluid were distinct between healthy, early OA, and late OA donors. Pathways differentially activated among these groups included structural deterioration, glycerophospholipid metabolism, inflammation, central energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and vitamin metabolism. Within disease states (early and late OA), subgroups of donors revealed distinct phenotypes. Phenotypes of OA exhibited increased inflammation (early and late OA), oxidative stress (late OA), or structural deterioration (early and late OA) in the synovial fluid.\\n\\nConclusionThese results revealed distinct metabolic phenotypes of OA in human synovial fluid, provide insight into pathogenesis, represent novel biomarkers and assist in developing personalized interventions for subgroups of OA patients.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin transactions are typically studied in vivo, or in vitro using artificial chromatin lacking the epigenetic complexity of the natural material. Attempting to bridge the gap between these approaches, we established a system for isolating the yeast genome as a library of mono-nucleosomes harboring the natural epigenetic signature, suitable for biochemical manipulation. Combined with deep sequencing, this library was used to investigate the intrinsic stability of individual nucleosomes, and - as proof of principle - the nucleosome preference of the chromatin remodeling complex, RSC. Our data indicate that the natural stability of nucleosomes differs greatly, with nucleosomes on tRNA genes and on promoters of protein-coding genes standing out as intrinsically unstable. Interestingly, RSC shows a distinct preference for nucleosomes derived from regions with a high density of histone variant H2A.Z, and this preference is indeed markedly diminished using nucleosomes from cells lacking H2A.Z. Importantly, the preference for H2A.Z remodeling/nucleosome ejection can also be reconstituted with recombinant nucleosome arrays. Together, our data indicate that, despite being separated from their genomic context, individual nucleosomes can retain their original identity as promoter- or TSS-nucleosomes. Besides shedding new light on nucleosome stability and the chromatin remodeler RSC, the simple experimental system outlined here should be generally applicable to the study of chromatin transactions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCardiometabolic affections greatly contribute to the global burden of disease. The susceptibility to these conditions associates with the ancestral genetic composition and gut microbiota. However, studies explicitly testing associations between genetic ancestry and gut microbes are rare. We examined whether the ancestral genetic composition was associated with gut microbiota, and split apart the effects of genetic and non-genetic factors on host health.\\n\\nResultsWe performed a cross-sectional study of 441 community-dwelling Colombian mestizos from five cities. We characterized the host genetic ancestry using 40 ancestry informative markers and gut microbiota through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We measured variables related to cardiometabolic health (adiposity, blood chemistry and blood pressure), diet (calories, macronutrients and fiber) and lifestyle (physical activity, smoking and medicament consumption). The ancestral genetic composition of the studied population was 67{+/-}6% European, 21{+/-}5% Native American and 12{+/-}5% African. While we found limited evidence of associations between genetic ancestry and gut microbiota or disease risk, we observed a strong link between gut microbes and cardiometabolic health. Multivariable-adjusted linear models indicated that gut microbiota was more likely to explain variance in host health than genetic ancestry. Further, we identified 9 OTUs associated with increased disease risk and 11 with decreased risk.\\n\\nConclusionsGut microbiota seems to be more meaningful to explain cardiometabolic disease risk than genetic ancestry in this mestizo population. Our study suggests that novel ways to control cardiometabolic disease risk, through modulation of the gut microbial community, could be applied regardless of the genetic ancestry of the intervened population.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to determine whether a change in the abundance of feral cats (Felis catus) in three areas of England had occurred between the completion of a survey undertaken by the Ministry for Agriculture Fisheries and Food in 1986/7 and the turn of the century. In the event of a rabies outbreak occurring in Britain, feral cats would be one vector of the disease that would need to be controlled under the Rabies (control) Order 1974. A total of 741 \\\"high risk sites\\\", found to provide appropriate conditions for feral cats, were surveyed between 1999 and 2000. The total number of feral cat colonies located within the survey areas was found to have fallen by 37% from 68 in 1986 to 43 in 1999/2000, translating to an estimated 212-247 fewer individual feral cats. Factories/trading estates and industrial premises continued to be the most common sites associated with urban feral cat colonies. However, the closing down of many traditional industries, such as mills and dockyards, and their replacement by more secure and insulated modern buildings, less amenable to feral cats finding warmth and food, had assisted the observed fall in numbers along with the effectiveness of neutering programs which are now taking place on many sites. Through this study information regarding feral cat colonies in urban landscapes as well colony size was gathered and fed into rabies contingency plans to help keep Britain rabies free into the future.",

    "abstract": "The central complex (CX) is a midline-situated collection of neuropil compartments in the arthropod central brain, implicated in higher-order processes such as goal-directed navigation. Here, we provide a systematic genetic-neuroanatomical analysis of the ellipsoid body (EB), a compartment which represents a major afferent portal of the Drosophila CX. The neuropil volume of the EB, along with its prominent input compartment, called the bulb, is subdivided into precisely tessellated domains, distinguishable based on intensity of the global marker DN-cadherin. EB tangential elements (so-called ring neurons), most of which are derived from the DALv2 neuroblast lineage, interconnect the bulb and EB domains in a topographically-organized fashion. Using the DN-cadherin domains as a framework, we first characterized the bulb-EB connectivity by Gal4 driver lines expressed in different DALv2 ring neuron (R-neuron) subclasses. We identified 11 subclasses, 6 of which correspond to previously described projection patterns, and 5 novel patterns. These subclasses both spatially (based on EB innervation pattern) and numerically (cell counts) summate to the total EB volume and R-neuron cell number, suggesting that our compilation of R-neuron subclasses approaches completion. EB columnar elements, as well as non-DALv2 derived extrinsic ring neurons (ExR-neurons), were also incorporated into this anatomical framework. Finally, we addressed the connectivity between R-neurons and their targets, using the anterograde trans-synaptic labeling method, trans-Tango. This study demonstrates putative interactions of R-neuron subclasses and reveals general principles of information flow within the EB network. Our work will facilitate the generation and testing of hypotheses regarding circuit interactions within the EB and the rest of the CX.",

We show that the stochastic transition between states can be implemented by the dynamics of a GRN comprising only 36 abstract genes.
