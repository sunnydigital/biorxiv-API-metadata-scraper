    "abstract": "Periodic bottlenecks play a major role in shaping the adaptive dynamics of natural and laboratory populations of asexual microbes. Here we study how they affect the  Extent of Adaptation (EoA), in such populations. EoA, the average fitness gain relative to the ancestor, is the quantity of interest in a large number of microbial experimental-evolution studies which assume that for any given bottleneck size (N0) and number of generations between bottlenecks (g), the harmonic mean size (HM=N0g) will predict the ensuing evolutionary dynamics. However, there are no theoretical or empirical validations for HM being a good predictor of EoA. Using experimental-evolution with Escherichia coli and individual-based simulations, we show that HM fails to predict EoA (i.e., higher N0g does not lead to higher EoA). This is because although higher g allows populations to arrive at superior benefits by entailing increased variation, it also reduces the efficacy of selection, which lowers EoA. We show that EoA can be maximized in evolution experiments by either maximizing N0 and/or minimizing g. We also conjecture that N0/g is a better predictor of EoA than N0g. Our results call for a re-evaluation of the role of population size in predicting fitness trajectories. They also aid in predicting adaptation in asexual populations, which has important evolutionary, epidemiological and economic implications.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in aging research, a multitude of aging models, and empirical evidence for diverse senescence patterns, understanding is lacking of the biological processes that shape senescence, both for simple and complex organisms. We show that for a isogenic Escherichia coli bacterial population senescence results from two stochastic processes. A primary random deterioration process within the cell, such as generated by random accumulation of damage, leads to an exponential increase in mortality early in life followed by a late age mortality plateau; a secondary process of stochastic asymmetric transmission of an unknown factor at cell fission influences mortality. This second process is required to explain the difference between the classical mortality plateaus detected for young mothers offspring and the near non-senescence of old mothers offspring as well as the lack of a mother offspring correlation in age at death. We observed that life span is predominantly determined by underlying stochastic stage dynamics. Our findings support models based on stage-specific actions of alleles for the evolution of senescence. This support might be surprising since these models that have not specifically been developed in the context of simple, single cell organisms. We call for exploration of similar stochastic influences beyond simple organisms.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative genetic analyses require extensive measurements of phenotypic traits, a task that is often not trivial, especially in wild populations. On top of instrumental measurement error, some traits may undergo transient (i.e. non-persistent) fluctuations that are biologically irrelevant for selection processes. These two sources of variability, which we denote here as measurement error in a broad sense, are possible causes for bias in the estimation of quantitative genetic parameters. We illustrate how in a continuous trait transient effects with a classical measurement error structure may bias estimates of heritability, selection gradients, and the predicted response to selection. We propose strategies to obtain unbiased estimates with the help of repeated measurements taken at an appropriate temporal scale. However, the fact that in quantitative genetic analyses repeated measurements are also used to isolate permanent environmental instead of transient effects, requires a re-assessment of the information content of repeated measurements. To do so, we propose to distinguish \\\"short-term\\\" from \\\"long-term\\\" repeats, where the former capture transient variability and the latter the permanent effects. We show how the inclusion of the corresponding variance components in quantitative genetic models yields unbiased estimates of all quantities of interest, and we illustrate the application of the method to data from a Swiss snow vole population.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONIt is established that normal fetal HRV represents the integration of the autonomic nervous system, components due to fetal body and breathing movements, baroreflex and circadian processes. There is also some evidence of possible intrinsic pacemaker rhythms of the SA node affecting HRV in adult disease.\\n\\nHowever, whether intrinsic HRV (iHRV) exists in the fetal period and whether this is affected by chronic fetal hypoxia has never been tested. Here, we show iHRV in isolated hearts from fetal sheep in late gestation and significant effects on iHRV of pregnancy complicated by chronic fetal hypoxia.\\n\\nMETHODSChronically catheterized ewes carrying male singleton fetuses were exposed to normoxia (n=6) or hypoxia (10% inspired O2, n=9) for the last third of gestation (105-138 dG; term~145 dG) in bespoke isobaric chambers, as before. At 138dG, isolated hearts were studied under a Langendorff preparation. CIMVA software was used to calculate basal iHRV matrix indices across five signal-analytical domains from the systolic peaks within 15 min segments in each heart, as before. Data presented as Mean+SEM were compared by the Students t test for unpaired data.\\n\\nRESULTSThis level of maternal H yields fetal PaO2 values of 11.5{+/-}0.6 relative to controls of 20.9{+/-}0.5 mmHg. Hearts isolated from H pregnancy showed approximately 4-fold increases in the Grid transformation feature as well as the AND similarity index (sgridAND, informational domain) and a 4-fold reduction in the Scale dependent Lyapunov exponent slope (SDLEalpha, invariant domain). We also detected a 2-fold reduction in the Recurrence quantification analysis, the percentage of laminarity and recurrences and maximum diagonal line (pL, pR, dlmax, all from geometric domain) and (AsymI, energetic domain). For dlmax and sgridAND measures, this is also correlated to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) across both groups.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThe isolated fetal hearts from the hypoxic pregnancy group exhibit a lower complexity in iHRV. This is the first evidence that iHRV originates in fetal life and that chronic fetal hypoxia significantly alters it.\\n\\nSignificance StatementFetal heart rate variability (fHRV) is an important indicator of health and disease, yet its physiological origins are poorly understood. Both, the heart, intrinsically, and extrinsic systems, such as the brain, are hypothesized to contribute to HRV. In a near-term fetal sheep model of human development, we identified fHRV components reflecting intrinsic contributions to fHRV. In addition, we show that these intrinsic fHRV components carry memory of chronic oxygen deprivation the fetus experienced during the last third of gestation.",

    "abstract": "During epithelial morphogenesis, cell contacts (junctions) are constantly remodeled by mechanical forces that work against adhesive forces. E-cadherin complexes play a pivotal role in this process by providing persistent cell adhesion and by transmitting mechanical tension. In this context, it is unclear how mechanical forces affect E-cadherin adhesion and junction dynamics.\\n\\nDuring Drosophila embryo axis elongation, Myosin-II activity in the apico-medial and junctional cortex generates mechanical forces to drive junction remodeling. Here we report that the ratio between Vinculin and E-cadherin intensities acts as a ratiometric readout for these mechanical forces (load) at E-cadherin complexes. Medial Myosin-II loads E-cadherin complexes on all junctions, exerts tensile forces, and increases levels of E-cadherin. Junctional Myosin-II, on the other hand, biases the distribution of load between junctions of the same cell, exerts shear forces, and decreases the levels of E-cadherin. This work suggests distinct effects of tensile versus shear stresses on E-cadherin adhesion.",

To test whether this model applies to more flexible learning regimes that require arbitrary sensorimotor associations, we have developed a cerebellar-dependent motor learning paradigm compatible with both mesoscale and single dendrite resolution calcium imaging in mice. Here, we find that CFs are preferentially driven by and more time-locked to correctly executed movements and other task parameters that predict reward outcome, exhibiting widespread correlated activity within parasagittal processing zones that is governed by these predictions. Together, such CF activity patterns are well-suited to drive learning by providing predictive instructional input consistent with an unsigned reinforcement learning signal that does not rely exclusively on motor errors.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAnalysis of the spatial sub-cellular distribution of proteins is of vital importance to fully understand context specific protein function. Some proteins can be found with a single location within a cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in multiple locations, can dynamically re-localise, or reside within an unknown functional compartment. These considerations lead to uncertainty in associating a protein to a single location. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS) based spatial proteomics relies on supervised machine learning algorithms to assign proteins to sub-cellular locations based on common gradient profiles. However, such methods fail to quantify uncertainty associated with sub-cellular class assignment. Here we reformulate the framework on which we perform statistical analysis. We propose a Bayesian generative classifier based on Gaussian mixture models to assign proteins probabilistically to sub-cellular niches, thus proteins have a probability distribution over sub-cellular locations, with Bayesian computation performed using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm, as well as Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Our methodology allows proteome-wide uncertainty quantification, thus adding a further layer to the analysis of spatial proteomics. Our framework is flexible, allowing many different systems to be analysed and reveals new modelling opportunities for spatial proteomics. We find our methods perform competitively with current state-of-the art machine learning methods, whilst simultaneously providing more information. We highlight several examples where classification based on the support vector machine is unable to make any conclusions, while uncertainty quantification using our approach provides biologically intriguing results. To our knowledge this is the first Bayesian model of MS-based spatial proteomics data.\\n\\nAuthor summarySub-cellular localisation of proteins provides insights into sub-cellular biological processes. For a protein to carry out its intended function it must be localised to the correct sub-cellular environment, whether that be organelles, vesicles or any sub-cellular niche. Correct sub-cellular localisation ensures the biochemical conditions for the protein to carry out its molecular function are met, as well as being near its intended interaction partners. Therefore, mis-localisation of proteins alters cell biochemistry and can disrupt, for example, signalling pathways or inhibit the trafficking of material around the cell. The sub-cellular distribution of proteins is complicated by proteins that can reside in multiple micro-environments, or those that move dynamically within the cell. Methods that predict protein sub-cellular localisation often fail to quantify the uncertainty that arises from the complex and dynamic nature of the sub-cellular environment. Here we present a Bayesian methodology to analyse protein sub-cellular localisation. We explicitly model our data and use Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty in our predictions. We find our method is competitive with state-of-the-art machine learning methods and additionally provides uncertainty quantification. We show that, with this additional information, we can make deeper insights into the fundamental biochemistry of the cell.",

Multiple methods with specific performance characteristics exist for detecting recent transmission chains, usually by clustering strains based on genotype similarities. With such a large variety of methods available, informed selection of an appropriate approach for determining transmissions within a given setting/time period is difficult.\\n\\nMethodsThis study combines whole genome sequence (WGS) data derived from 324 isolates collected 2005-2010 in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a high endemic setting, with phylodynamics to unveil the timing of transmission events posited by a variety of standard genotyping methods. Clustering data based on Spoligotyping, 24-loci MIRU-VNTR typing, WGS based SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) and core genome multi locus sequence typing (cgMLST) typing were evaluated.\\n\\nFindingsOur results suggest that clusters based on Spoligotyping could encompass transmission events that occurred over 70 years prior to sampling while 24-loci-MIRU-VNTR often represented two or more decades of transmission. Instead, WGS based genotyping applying low SNP or cgMLST allele thresholds allows for determination of recent transmission events in timespans of up to 10 years e.g. for a 5 SNP/allele cut-off.\\n\\nInterpretationWith the rapid uptake of WGS methods in surveillance and outbreak tracking, the findings obtained in this study can guide the selection of appropriate clustering methods for uncovering relevant transmission chains within a given time-period. For high resolution cluster analyses, WGS-SNP and cgMLST based analyses have similar clustering/timing characteristics even for data obtained from a high incidence setting.",

    "abstract": "Nucleoporins build the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which, as sole gate for nuclear-cytoplasmic exchange, are of outmost importance for normal cell function. Defects in the process of nucleocytoplasmic transport or in its machinery have been frequently described in human diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, but only in a few cases of developmental disorders. Here we report biallelic mutations in the nucleoporin NUP88 as a novel cause of lethal fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) in two families. FADS comprises a spectrum of clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders with congenital malformations related to impaired fetal movement. We show that genetic disruption of nup88 in zebrafish results in pleiotropic developmental defects reminiscent of those seen in affected human fetuses, including locomotor defects as well as defects at neuromuscular junctions. Phenotypic alterations become visible at distinct developmental stages, both in affected human fetuses and in zebrafish, whereas early stages of development are apparently normal. The zebrafish phenotypes caused by nup88 deficiency are only rescued by expressing wild-type nup88 and not the disease-linked mutant forms of nup88. Furthermore, using human and mouse cell lines as well as immunohistochemistry on fetal muscle tissue, we demonstrate that NUP88 depletion affects rapsyn, a key regulator of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction. Together, our studies provide the first characterization of NUP88 in vertebrate development, expand our understanding of the molecular events causing FADS, and suggest that variants in NUP88 should be investigated in cases of FADS.",

    "abstract": "The ecological impacts of roads and railways extend into the surrounding landscape, leading to habitat degradation and reduced animal densities within an area that is considerably larger than the actual road or railway corridor. For birds, an extensive meta-analysis has pointed at an average of 20% density reduction within 1 km from the infrastructure. I investigated to what extent this density reduction could potentially compromise the habitat quality and conservation value of Swedish Natura 2000 areas designated for the protection of birds (Special Protection Areas; SPAs). A majority (63%) of Swedish SPAs are at least to some extent found within this 1 km potential effect zone. The total overlap between SPA and effect zone is 126,000 ha, or 4.2% of the countrys SPA area. There are however large differences among biogeographical regions. In the southern (continental) and coastal regions combined, 25.8% of the total SPA area fall within the effect zone, representing an estimated 4-7% reduction in bird abundance within SPAs. The probability of overlap with effect zone is higher for larger SPAs. However, the proportion of overlap is higher for smaller SPAs, and accordingly smaller sites can be assumed to experience a greater impact from transport infrastructure and traffic. The impacts on Natura 2000 sites are particularly concerning as this network of protected areas is a cornerstone to maintain and restore biodiversity within EU. I recommend putting a stronger emphasis in the management of Natura 2000 sites on the potential threats to wildlife conservation caused by transport infrastructure and traffic. Special attention should be paid in sites with a large overlap with the effect zone, and in sites hosting particularly vulnerable taxa or habitats. Infrastructure owners and managers should do their best to minimize and compensate for the negative impacts of roads and railways and related traffic in SPAs and other protected areas.",

    "abstract": "MotivationRelief is a family of machine learning algorithms that uses nearest-neighbors to select features whose association with an outcome may be due to epistasis or statistical interactions with other features in high-dimensional data. Relief-based estimators are non-parametric in the statistical sense that they do not have a parameterized model with an underlying probability distribution for the estimator, making it difficult to determine the statistical significance of Relief-based attribute estimates. Thus, a statistical inferential formalism is needed to avoid imposing arbitrary thresholds to select the most important features.\\n\\nMethodsWe reconceptualize the Relief-based feature selection algorithm to create a new family of STatistical Inference Relief (STIR) estimators that retains the ability to identify interactions while incorporating sample variance of the nearest neighbor distances into the attribute importance estimation. This variance permits the calculation of statistical significance of features and adjustment for multiple testing of Relief-based scores. Specifically, we develop a pseudo t-test version of Relief-based algorithms for case-control data.\\n\\nResultsWe demonstrate the statistical power and control of type I error of the STIR family of feature selection methods on a panel of simulated data that exhibits properties reflected in real gene expression data, including main effects and network interaction effects. We compare the performance of STIR when the adaptive radius method is used as the nearest neighbor constructor with STIR when thefixed-k nearest neighbor constructor is used. We apply STIR to real RNA-Seq data from a study of major depressive disorder and discuss STIRs straightforward extension to genome-wide association studies.\\n\\nAvailabilityCode and data available at http://insilico.utulsa.edu/software/STIR.\\n\\nContactbrett.mckinney@gmail.com",

    "abstract": "Wildfires are becoming more frequent in parts of the globe, but predicting where and when wildfires occur remains difficult. To predict wildfire extremes across the contiguous United States, we integrate a 30 year wildfire record with meteorological and housing data in spatiotemporal Bayesian statistical models with spatially varying nonlinear effects. We compared different distributions for the number and sizes of large fires to generate a posterior predictive distribution based on finite sample maxima for extreme events (the largest fires over bounded spatiotemporal domains). A zero-inflated negative binomial model for fire counts and a lognormal model for burned areas provided the best performance. This model attains 99% interval coverage for the number of fires and 93% coverage for fire sizes over a six year withheld data set. Dryness and air temperature strongly predict extreme wildfire probabilities. Housing density has a hump-shaped relationship with fire occurrence, with more fires occurring at intermediate housing densities. Statistically, these drivers affect the chance of an extreme wildfire in two ways: by altering fire size distributions, and by altering fire frequency, which influences sampling from the tails of fire size distributions. We conclude that recent extremes should not be surprising, and that the contiguous United States may be on the verge of even larger wildfire extremes.",

But few programs can align RNA on the genome and accurately discover introns, especially with long reads. We introduce Magic-BLAST, a new aligner based on ideas from the Magic pipeline. It uses innovative techniques that include the optimization of a spliced alignment score and selective masking during seed selection. We evaluate the performance of Magic-BLAST to accurately map short or long sequences and its ability to discover introns on real RNA-seq data sets from PacBio, Roche and Illumina runs, and on six benchmarks, and compare it to other popular aligners. Additionally, we look at alignments of human idealized RefSeq mRNA sequences perfectly matching the genome. We show that Magic-BLAST is the best at intron discovery over a wide range of conditions and the best at mapping reads longer than 250 bases, from any platform. It is versatile and robust to high levels of mismatches or extreme base composition, and reasonably fast. It can align reads to a BLAST database or a FASTA file.

Augmenting few real observations with generated in silico samples could lead to more robust analysis results and a higher reproducibility rate. Here we propose the use of conditional single cell Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (cscGANs) for the realistic generation of single cell RNA-seq data. cscGANs learn non-linear gene-gene dependencies from complex, multi cell type samples and use this information to generate realistic cells of defined types. Augmenting sparse cell populations with cscGAN generated cells improves downstream analyses such as the detection of marker genes, the robustness and reliability of classifiers, the assessment of novel analysis algorithms, and might reduce the number of animal experiments and costs in consequence. cscGANs outperform existing methods for single cell RNA-seq data generation in quality and hold great promise for the realistic generation and augmentation of other biomedical data types.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria coordinate DNA replication and cell division, ensuring that a complete set of genetic material is passed onto the next generation. When bacteria encounter DNA damage or impediments to DNA replication, a cell cycle checkpoint is activated to delay cell division by expressing a cell division inhibitor. The prevailing model for bacterial DNA damage checkpoints is that activation of the DNA damage response and protease mediated degradation of the cell division inhibitor is sufficient to regulate the checkpoint process. Our recent genome-wide screens identified the gene ddcA as critical for surviving exposure to a broad spectrum of DNA damage. The ddcA deletion phenotypes are dependent on the checkpoint enforcement protein YneA. We found that expression of the checkpoint recovery proteases could not compensate for ddcA deletion. Similarly, expression if ddcA could not compensate for the absence of the checkpoint recovery proteases, indicating that DdcA function is distinct from the checkpoint recovery step. Deletion of ddcA resulted in sensitivity to yneA overexpression independent of YneA protein levels or stability, further supporting the conclusion that DdcA regulates YneA through a proteolysis independent mechanism. Using a functional GFP-YneA we found that DdcA inhibits YneA activity independent of YneA localization, suggesting that DdcA may regulate YneA access to its target. These results uncover a regulatory step that is important for controlling the DNA damage checkpoint in bacteria, and suggests that the typical mechanism of degrading the checkpoint enforcement protein is insufficient to control the rate of cell division in response to DNA damage.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAll cells coordinate DNA replication and cell division. When cells encounter DNA damage, the process of DNA replication is slowed and the cell must also delay cell division. In bacteria, the process has long been thought to occur using two principle modes of regulation. The first, is RecA coated ssDNA transmits the signal of DNA damage through inactivation of the repressor of the DNA damage (SOS) response regulon, which results in expression of a cell division inhibitor establishing the checkpoint. The second principle step is protease mediated degradation of the cell division inhibitor relieving the checkpoint. Recent work by our lab and others has suggested that this process may be more complex than originally thought. Here, we investigated a gene of unknown function that we previously identified as important for survival when the bacterium Bacillus subtilis is exposed to DNA damage. We found that this gene negatively regulates the cell division inhibitor, but is functionally distinct from the checkpoint recovery process. We provide evidence that this gene functions as an antagonist to establishing the DNA damage checkpoint. Our study uncovers a novel layer of regulation in the bacterial DNA damage checkpoint process challenging the longstanding models established in the bacterial DNA damage response field.",

    "abstract": "The human 1q21.1 deletion of ten genes is associated with increased risk schizophrenia. The deletion involves the {beta}-subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex, a key energy sensor in the cell. Although neurons have a high demand for energy and low capacity to store nutrients, the role of AMPK in neuronal physiology is poorly defined. Here we show that AMPK is important in the nervous system for maintaining neuronal integrity and for stress survival and longevity in Drosophila. To understand its impact on behavior and potential contribution to the 1q21.1 deletion syndrome, we focused on sleep, as its main role is proposed to be to reestablish neuronal energy levels that are diminished during energy-demanding wakefulness. Sleep disturbances are one of the most common problems affecting individuals with psychiatric disorders. We show that AMPK is required to maintain proper sleep architecture and for sleep recovery following sleep deprivation. Neuronal AMPK{beta} loss specifically leads to sleep fragmentation and causes dysregulation of genes believed to play a role in sleep homeostasis. Our data also suggest that AMPK{beta} loss may contribute to the increased risk of developing mental disorders and sleep disturbances associated with the human 1q21.1 deletion. Sleep is regulated by circadian and homeostatic processes. While the circadian clock is well studied, the molecular mechanism underlying homeostasis remains largely unknown. Our data suggest that AMPK is required for sleep maintenance and may be involved in the homeostatic process of sleep regulation.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe human 1q21.1 chromosomal deletion is associated with increased risk of schizophrenia. Because this deletion affects only a small number of genes, it provides a unique opportunity to identify the specific disease-causing gene(s) using animal models. Here, we report the use of a Drosophila model to identify the potential contribution of one gene affected by the 1q21.1 deletion - PRKAB2 - to the pathology of the 1q21.1 deletion syndrome. PRKAB2 encodes a subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex, the main cellular energy sensor. We show that AMPK deficiency reduces lifespan and causes structural abnormalities in neuronal dendritic structures, a phenotype which has been linked to schizophrenia. Furthermore, cognitive impairment and altered sleep patterning are some of the most common symptoms of schizophrenia. Therefore, to understand the potential contribution of PRKAB2 to the 1q21.1 syndrome, we tested whether AMPK alterations would cause defects in learning and sleep. Our study shows that lack of PRKAB2 and AMPK-complex activity, in the nervous system leads to reduced learning and to dramatic sleep disturbances. Thus, our data links a single 1q21.1-related gene with phenotypes that resemble common symptoms of schizophrenia, suggesting that this gene, PRKAB2, may contribute to the risk of developing schizophrenia.",

However, trait incongruence can also arise from changes that occur on discordant gene trees, a process referred to as hemiplasy. Hemiplasy is rarely taken into account in studies of convergent evolution, despite the fact that phylogenomic studies have revealed rampant discordance. Here, we study the relative probabilities of homoplasy (including convergence and reversal) and hemiplasy for an incongruent trait. We derive expressions for the probabilities of the two events, showing that they depend on many of the same parameters. We find that hemiplasy is as likely-- or more likely--than homoplasy for a wide range of conditions, even when levels of discordance are low. We also present a new method to calculate the ratio of these two probabilities (the \\\"hemiplasy risk factor\\\") along the branches of a phylogeny of arbitrary length. Such calculations can be applied to any tree in order to identify when and where incongruent traits may be more likely to be due to hemiplasy than homoplasy.",

Discovery of the methanogenesis gene cluster methyl-coenzyme M reductase (Mcr) in the Bathyarchaeota and thereafter the Verstraetearchaeota led to a paradigm shift, pushing back the evolutionary origin of methanogenesis to pre-date that of the Euryarchaeota. The methylotrophic methanogenesis found in the non-Euryarchaota distinguished itself from the predominantly hydrogenotrophic methanogens found in euryarchaeal orders as the former do not couple methanogenesis to carbon fixation through the reductive acetyl-coenzyme A (Wood-Ljungdahl) pathway, which was interpreted as evidence for independent evolution of the two methanogenesis pathways. Here, we report the discovery of a complete and divergent hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway in a novel, thermophilic order of the Verstraetearchaeota which we have named Candidatus Methanohydrogenales, as well as the presence of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway in the crenarchaeal order Desulfurococcales.

Using systematic, unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screens with a sterol-sensitive endogenous HMGCR reporter, we comprehensively map the E3 ligase landscape required for sterol-accelerated HMGCR degradation. We find that RNF145 and gp78, independently co-ordinate HMGCR ubiquitination and degradation. RNF145, a sterol-responsive ER-resident E3 ligase, is unstable but accumulates following sterol depletion. Sterol addition triggers RNF145 recruitment to HMGCR and Insig-1, promoting HMGCR ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. In the absence of both RNF145 and gp78, Hrd1, a third UBE2G2-dependent ligase partially regulates HMGCR activity.

Using this method, we were able to identify 156 RNase A-solubilized proteins of which 144 were known RBPs/RBP candidates. Interestingly, several key players of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway were enriched in RNase A-solubilized fraction and the RNA-mediated chromatin association of these factors appeared to be dependent on transcriptional elongation. Furthermore, some enzymes involved in metabolic pathways were also released from chromatin and/or an insoluble nuclear structure by RNase A treatment.

Studies in human patients and mouse HD models suggest that disturbances of neuronal function in the neocortex play an important role in the disease onset and progression. However, the precise nature and time course of cortical alterations in HD have remained elusive. Here, we use chronic in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of single neurons in layer 2/3 of the primary motor cortex in awake, behaving R6/2 transgenic HD mice and wildtype littermates. R6/2 mice show age-dependent changes in neuronal activity with a clear increase in activity at the age of 8.5 weeks, preceding the onset of motor and neurological symptoms. Furthermore, quantitative proteomics demonstrate a pronounced downregulation of synaptic proteins in the cortex, and histological analyses in R6/2 mice and HD patient samples reveal reduced inputs from parvalbumin-positive interneurons onto layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. Thus, our study provides a time-resolved description as well as mechanistic details of cortical circuit dysfunction in HD.\\n\\nSignificance statementFuntional alterations in the cortex are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Huntingtons disease (HD).

    "abstract": "Surface plasmons are highly sensitive to refractive index variations adjacent to the surface. This sensitivity has been exploited successfully for chemical and biological assays. In these systems, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based sensor detects temporal variations in the refractive index at a point. SPR has also been used in imaging systems where the spatial variations of refractive index in the sample provide the contrast mechanism. A high numerical aperture objective lens has been used to design SPR microscopy systems with the ability to image adherent live cells. Addressing research questions in cell physiology and pharmacology often requires the development of a multimodal microscope where complementary information can be obtained.\\n\\nIn this paper, we present the development of a multimodal microscope that combines surface plasmon resonance imaging with a number of additional imaging modalities including bright-field, epi-fluorescence, total internal reflection microscopy (TIRM) and SPR fluorescence microscopy. We used a high numerical aperture objective lens to achieve SPR and TIR microscopy with the ability to image adherent live cells non-invasively. The platform has been used to image live cell cultures demonstrating both fluorescent and label-free techniques. The SPR and TIR imaging systems feature a wide field of view (300 {micro}m) that allows measurements from multiple cells while the resolution is sufficient to image fine cellular processes. The ability of the platform to perform label-free functional imaging of living cell was demonstrated by imaging the spatial variations in contraction of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. This technique has a promise for non-invasive imaging of the development of cultured cells over very long periods of time.",

    "abstract": "Despite the success of the production of animals by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) in many species, the method is limited by a low efficiency. After zygotic genome activation (ZGA), a large number of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are expressed, including the murine endogenous retrovirus-L (MuERVL/MERVL). In this study, we generated a series of MERVL-reporter mouse strains to detect the ZGA event in embryos. We found that the majority of SCNT embryos exhibited ZGA failure, and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) prevented SCNT reprogramming. Overexpression of the H3K27me3-specific demethylase KDM6A, but not KDM6B, improved the efficiency of SCNT. Conversely, knockdown KDM6B not only facilitate ZGA, but also impede ectopic Xist expression in SCNT reprogramming. Furthermore, the knockdown of KDM6B increased the rate of SCNT-derived Duchenne muscular dystrophy embryonic stem cell establishment, indicate that these results not only provide insight into the mechanisms underlying failures of SCNT, but also may extend the applications of SCNT.",

    "abstract": "An aerial line transect survey of whales in West and East Greenland was conducted in August-September 2015. The survey covered the area between the coast of West Greenland and offshore (up to 100 km) to the shelf break. In East Greenland, the survey lines covered the area from the coast up to 50 km offshore crossing the shelf break. A total of 423 sightings of 12 cetacean species were obtained and abundance estimates were developed for common minke whale, from now on called minke whale, (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) (32 sightings), fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) (129 sightings), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) (84 sightings), harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) (55 sightings), long-finned pilot whale, from now on called pilot whale, (Globicephala melas) (42 sightings) and white-beaked dolphins (Lagenorhynchus albirostri) (50 sightings). The developed at-surface abundance estimates were corrected for both perception bias and availability bias if possible. Data on surface corrections for minke whales and harbour porpoises were collected from whales instrumented with satellite-linked time-depth-recorders. Options for estimation methods are presented and the preferred estimates are: Minke whales: 5,095 (95% CI: 2,171-11,961) in West Greenland and 2,762 (95% CI: 1,160-6,574) in East Greenland, fin whales: 2,215 (95% CI: 1,017-4,823) in West Greenland and 6,440 (95% CI: 3,901-10,632) in East Greenland, humpback whales: 993 (95% CI: 434-2,272) in West Greenland and 4,223 (95%CI: 1,845-9,666) in East Greenland, harbour porpoise: 83,321 (95% CI: 43,377-160,047) in West Greenland and 1,642 (95% CI: 319-8,464) in East Greenland, pilot whales: 9,190 (95% CI: 3,635-23,234) in West Greenland and 258 (95% CI: 50-1,354) in East Greenland, white-beaked dolphins 15,261 (95% CI: 7,048-33,046) in West Greenland and 11,889 (95% CI: 4,710-30,008) in East Greenland. The abundance of cetaceans in coastal areas of East Greenland has not been estimated before, but the limited historical information from the area indicate that the achieved abundance estimates were remarkably high. When comparing the abundance estimates from 2015 in West Greenland with a similar survey conducted in 2007 there is a clear trend towards lower densities in 2015 for the three baleen whale species and white-beaked dolphins. Harbour porpoises and pilot whales however, did not show a similar decline. The decline in baleen whale and white-beaked dolphin abundance is likely due to emigration to the East Greenland shelf areas where recent climate driven changes in pelagic productivity may have accelerated favourable conditions for these species.",

The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with enhanced susceptibility to and severity of nosocomial CDI; however, the mechanisms driving this phenomenon have not been elucidated. NSAIDs alter prostaglandin (PG) metabolism by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. Here, we found that treatment with the NSAID indomethacin prior to infection altered the microbiota and dramatically increased mortality and intestinal pathology associated with CDI in mice. We demonstrate that in C. difficile-infected animals, indomethacin lead to PG deregulation, an altered proinflammatory transcriptional and protein profile, and perturbed epithelial cell junctions. These effects were paralleled by an increased recruitment of intestinal neutrophils and CD4+ cells. Together, these data implicate NSAIDs in perturbation of the gut microbiota and disruption of protective COX-mediated PG production during CDI, resulting in altered epithelial integrity and associated immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Patulin contamination is a severe issue that restricts the development of the global fruit processing industry. Yeast adsorbs patulin more effectively than other microbial adsorbents, and this adsorption process mainly depends on the function of the cell wall. Additionally, exogenous calcium ions aid in yeast cell wall formation according to reports. Therefore, in the present study, the effect of exogenous calcium concentrations on the cell wall structure and the patulin adsorption capability was studied. We showed that the ability of the yeast to adsorb patulin was strengthened with an increase in exogenous calcium concentrations between 1x10-4 - 1x10-2 mol/L. Moreover, yeast cell wall thickness, {beta}-1,3-glucan content and the activities of the key catalytic enzymes {beta}-1,3-glucanase and {beta}-1,3-glycosyl transferase were all increased within this range. The results indicated that exogenous calcium activates key enzymes and that these enzymes are crucial for cell wall network formation and patulin adsorption capability.\\n\\nImportanceThe present work illuminates that the exogenous calcium ions could determine the insoluble network structure by regulating key enzyme activities under certain concentrations, thus indirectly influencing the yeast cell patulin adsorption capability. It could enhance patulin adsorption capability of yeast walls and successfully apply to fruit juice industry.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of CRISPR/Cas gene editing has allowed for major advances in many biomedical disciplines and basic research. One arrangement of this biotechnology, a nuclease-based gene drive, can rapidly deliver a genetic element through a given population and studies in fungi and metazoans have demonstrated the success of such a system. This methodology has the potential to control biological populations and contribute to eradication of insect-borne diseases, agricultural pests, and invasive species. However, there remain challenges in the design, optimization, and implementation of gene drives including concerns regarding biosafety, containment, and control/inhibition. Given the numerous gene drive arrangements possible, there is a growing need for more advanced designs. In this study, we use budding yeast to develop an artificial multi-locus gene drive system. Our minimal setup requires only a single copy of S. pyogenes Cas9 and three guide RNAs to propagate three separate gene drives. We demonstrate how this system could be used for targeted allele replacement of native genes and to suppress NHEJ repair systems by modifying DNA Ligase IV. A multi-locus gene drive configuration provides an expanded suite of options for complex attributes including pathway redundancy, combatting evolved resistance, and safeguards for control, inhibition, or reversal of drive action.",

    "abstract": "The vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is regulated by reversible disassembly into autoinhibited V1-ATPase and Vo proton channel sectors, a process that is poorly understood on the molecular level. V-ATPase is a rotary motor and recent structural analysis revealed that disassembled V1 and Vo are in different rotary states, a mismatch that is likely responsible for the inability to reconstitute holo V-ATPase from its functional sectors in vitro. Here, using the model organism S. cerevisiae, we show that a key impediment for binding of autoinhibited V1 to Vo is the conformation of the inhibitory C-terminus of subunit H (HCT). Using biolayer interferometry and biochemical analysis, we show that selective disruption of HCTs binding site on V1 allows in vitro assembly of a structurally and functionally coupled V-ATPase complex. The resultant mutant V-ATPase, however, does not disassemble as readily as the wild type enzyme, highlighting the importance of HCTs conformation in the mechanism of reversible disassembly. These findings pave the way for identifying molecules that allow for therapeutic modulation of aberrant V-ATPase activity in the disease state.",

    "abstract": "Serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins), typically fold to a metastable native state and undergo a major conformational change in order to inhibit target proteases. However, conformational labiality of the native serpin fold renders them susceptible to misfolding and aggregation, and underlies misfolding diseases such as a1-antitrypsin deficiency. Serpin specificity towards its protease target is dictated by its flexible and solvent exposed reactive centre loop (RCL), which forms the initial interaction with the target protease during inhibition. Previous studies have attempted to alter the specificity by mutating the RCL to that of a target serpin, but the rules governing specificity are not understood well enough yet to enable specificity to be engineered at will. In this paper, we use conserpin, a synthetic, thermostable serpin, as a model protein with which to investigate the determinants of serpin specificity by engineering its RCL. Replacing the RCL sequence with that from 1-antitrypsin fails to restore specificity against trypsin or human neutrophil elastase. Structural determination of the RCL-engineered conserpin and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that, although the RCL sequence may partially dictate specificity, local electrostatics and RCL dynamics may dictate the rate of insertion during protease inhibition, and thus whether it behaves as an inhibitor or a substrate. Engineering serpin specificity is therefore substantially more complex than solely manipulating the RCL sequence, and will require a more thorough understanding of how conformational dynamics achieves the delicate balance between stability, folding and function required by the exquisite serpin mechanism of action.",

    "abstract": "Moving fronts of cells are essential for development, repair and disease progression. Therefore, understanding and quantifying the details of the mechanisms that drive the movement of cell fronts is of wide interest. Quantitatively identifying the role of intercellular interactions, and in particular the role of cell pushing, remains an open question. Indeed, perhaps the most common continuum mathematical idealization of moving cell fronts is to treat the population of cells, either implicitly or explicitly, as a population of point particles undergoing a random walk that neglects intercellular interactions. In this work, we report a combined experimental-modelling approach showing that intercellular interactions contribute significantly to the spatial spreading of a population of cells. We use a novel experimental data set with PC-3 prostate cancer cells that have been pretreated with Mitomycin-C to suppress proliferation. This allows us to experimentally separate the effects of cell migration from cell proliferation, thereby enabling us to focus on the migration process in detail as the population of cells recolonizes an initially-vacant region in a series of two-dimensional experiments. We quantitatively model the experiments using a stochastic modelling framework, based on Langevin dynamics, which explicitly incorporates random motility and various intercellular forces including: (i) long range attraction (adhesion); and (ii) finite size effects that drive short range repulsion (pushing). Quantitatively comparing the ability of this model to describe the experimentally observed population-level behaviour provides us with quantitative insight into the roles of random motility and intercellular interactions. To quantify the mechanisms at play, we calibrate the stochastic model to match experimental cell density profiles to obtain estimates of cell diffusivity, D, and the amplitude of intercellular forces, f0. Our analysis shows that taking a standard modelling approach which ignores intercellular forces provides a poor match to the experimental data whereas incorporating intercellular forces, including short-range pushing and longer range attraction, leads to a faithful representation of the experimental observations. These results demonstrate a significant role for intercellular interactions in cell invasion.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMoving cell fronts are routinely observed in various physiological processes, such as wound healing, malignant invasion and embryonic morphogenesis. We explore the effects of a previously overlooked mechanism that contributes to population-level front movement: pushing. Our framework is flexible and incorporates range of reasonable biological phenomena, such as random motility, cell-to-cell adhesion, and pushing. We find that neglecting finite size effects and intercellular forces, such as cell pushing, reduces our ability to mimic and predict our experimental observations.",

    "abstract": "As obligate kinase partners, cyclins control the switch-like cell cycle transitions that orchestrate orderly duplication and segregation of genomes. Meiosis, the cell division that generates gametes for sexual reproduction, poses unique challenges because two rounds of chromosome segregation must be executed without intervening DNA replication. Mammalian cells express numerous, temporally regulated cyclins, but how these proteins collaborate to control meiosis remains poorly understood. Here, we delineate an essential function for mouse cyclin B3 in the first meiotic division of oocytes. Females genetically ablated for cyclin B3 are viable, indicating the protein is dispensable for mitotic divisions, but are sterile. Mutant oocytes appear normal until metaphase I but then display a highly penetrant failure to transition to anaphase I. They arrest with hallmarks of defective APC/C activation, including no separase activity and high MPF, cyclin B1, and securin levels. Partial APC/C activation occurs, however, as exogenously expressed APC/C substrates can be degraded and arrest can be suppressed by inhibiting MPF kinase. Cyclin B3 is itself targeted for degradation by the APC/C. Cyclin B3 forms active kinase complexes with CDK1, and meiotic progression requires cyclin B3-associated kinase activity. Collectively, our findings indicate that cyclin B3 is essential for oocyte meiosis because it fine-tunes APC/C activity as a kinase-activating CDK partner. Cyclin B3 homologs from frog, zebrafish, and fruitfly rescue meiotic progression in cyclin B3-deficient mouse oocytes, indicating conservation of the biochemical properties and possibly cellular functions of this germline-critical cyclin.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundClubroot disease caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae (Phytomyxea, Rhizaria) is one of the economically most important diseases of Brassica crops. The formation of hypertrophied roots accompanied by altered metabolism and hormone homeostasis is typical for infected plants. Not all roots of infected plants show the same phenotypic changes. While some roots remain uninfected, others develop galls of diverse size. The aim of this study was to analyse and compare the intra-plant heterogeneity of P. brassicae root galls and symptomless roots of the same host plants (Brassica oleracea var. gongylodes) collected from a commercial field in Austria using transcriptome analyses.\\n\\nResultsTranscriptomes were markedly different between symptomless roots and gall tissue. Symptomless roots showed transcriptomic traits previously described for resistant plants. Genes involved in host cell wall synthesis and reinforcement were up-regulated in symptomless roots indicating elevated tolerance against P. brassicae. By contrast, genes involved in cell wall degradation and modification processes like expansion were up-regulated in root galls. Hormone metabolism differed between symptomless roots and galls. Brassinosteroid-synthesis was down-regulated in root galls, whereas jasmonic acid synthesis was down-regulated in symptomless roots. Cytokinin metabolism and signalling were up-regulated in symptomless roots with the exception of one CKX6 homolog, which was strongly down-regulated. Salicylic acid (SA) mediated defence response was up-regulated in symptomless roots, compared with root gall tissue. This is probably caused by a secreted benzoic acid salicylic acid methyl transferase from the pathogen (PbBSMT), which was one of the highest expressed pathogen genes in gall tissue. The PbBSMT derived Methyl-SA potentially leads to increased pathogen tolerance in uninfected roots.\\n\\nConclusionsInfected and uninfected roots of clubroot infected plants showed transcriptomic differences similar to those previously described between clubroot resistant and susceptible hosts. The here described intra-plant heterogeneity suggests, that for a better understanding of clubroot disease targeted, spatial analyses of clubroot infected plants will be vital in understanding this economically important disease.",

    "abstract": "Computer simulations play an important role in testing hypotheses, integrating knowledge, and providing predictions of neural circuit functions. While considerable effort has been dedicated into simulating primate or rodent brains, the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is becoming a promising model animal in computational neuroscience for its small brain size, complex cognitive behavior, and abundancy of data available from genes to circuits. Moreover, several Drosophila connectome projects have generated a large number of neuronal images that account for a significant portion of the brain, making a systematic investigation of the whole brain circuit possible. Supported by FlyCircuit (http://www.flycircuit.tw), one of the largest Drosophila neuron image databases, we began a long-term project with the goal to construct a whole-brain spiking network model of the Drosophila brain. In this paper, we report the outcome of the first phase of the project. We developed the Flysim platform, which 1) identifies the polarity of each neuron arbor, 2) predicts connections between neurons, 3) translates morphology data from the database into physiology parameters for computational modeling, 4) reconstructs a brain-wide network model, which consists of 20,089 neurons and 1,044,020 synapses, and 5) performs computer simulations of the resting state. We compared the reconstructed brain network with a randomized brain network by shuffling the connections of each neuron. We found that the reconstructed brain can be easily stabilized by implementing synaptic short-term depression, while the randomized one exhibited seizure-like firing activity under the same treatment. Furthermore, the reconstructed Drosophila brain was structurally and dynamically more diverse than the randomized one and exhibited both Poisson-like and patterned firing activities. Despite being at its early stage of development, this single-cell level brain model allows us to study some of the fundamental properties of neural networks including network balance, critical behavior, long-term stability, and plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Northern Fennoscandia and the Sakha Republic in the Russian Federation represent the northernmost regions on Earth where cattle farming has been traditionally practiced. In this study, we performed whole-genome resequencing to genetically characterize three rare native breeds Eastern Finncattle, Western Finncattle and Yakutian cattle adapted to these northern Eurasian regions. We examined the demographic history, genetic diversity and unfolded loci under natural or artificial selection. On average, we achieved 13.01-fold genome coverage after mapping the sequencing reads on the bovine reference genome (UMD 3.1) and detected a total of 17.45 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1.95 million insertions-deletions (indels). We observed that the ancestral species (Bos primigenius) of Eurasian taurine cattle experienced two notable prehistorical declines in effective population size associated with dramatic climate changes. The modern Yakutian cattle exhibited a higher level of within-population variation in terms of number of SNPs and nucleotide diversity than the contemporary European taurine breeds. This result is in contrast to the results of marker-based cattle breed diversity studies, indicating assortment bias in previous analyses. Our results suggest that the effective population size of the ancestral Asiatic taurine cattle may have been higher than that of the European cattle. Alternatively, our findings could indicate the hybrid origins of the Yakutian cattle ancestries and possibly the lack of intensive artificial selection. We identified a number of genomic regions under selection that may have contributed to the adaptation to the northern and subarctic environments, including genes involved in disease resistance, sensory perception, cold adaptation and growth. By characterizing the native breeds, we were able to obtain new information on cattle genomes and on the value of the adapted breeds for the conservation of cattle genetic resources.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous obligate intracellular eukaryotic parasite that causes congenital birth defects, disease of the immunocompromised and blindness. Protein glycosylation plays an important role in the infectivity and evasion of immune response of many eukaryotic parasites and is also of great relevance to vaccine design. Here, we demonstrate that MIC2, the motility-associated adhesin of T. gondii, has highly glycosylated thrombospondin repeat domains (TSR). At least seven C-linked and three O-linked glycosylation sites exist within MIC2, with >95% occupancy at O-glycosylation sites. We demonstrate that the addition of O-glycans to MIC2 is mediated by a protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 homologue (TgPOFUT2) encoded by TGGT1_273550. While POFUT2 homologues are important for stabilizing motility associated adhesins and host infection in other apicomplexan parasites, in T. gondii loss of TgPOFUT2 has only a modest impact on MIC2 levels and the wider proteome. Consistent with this, both plaque formation and tachyzoite infectivity are broadly similar in the presence or absence of TgPOFUT2. These findings demonstrate that TgPOFUT2 O-glycosylates MIC2 and that this glycan is dispensable in T. gondii tachyzoites.",

    "abstract": "Meiosis, a cell division to generate gametes for sexual reproduction in eukaryotes, executes a single round of DNA replication and two successive rounds of chromosome segregation [1]. The extraordinary reliability of the meiotic cycle requires the activities of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) associated with specific cyclins [2-4]. Cyclins are the regulatory subunits of protein kinases, which are the main regulators of maturation promoting factor or mitosis promoting factor (MPF) [5, 6] and anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) [7, 8] in eukaryotic cell division. But how cyclins collaborate to control meiosis is still largely unknown. Cyclin B3 (Ccnb3) shares homology with A- and B-type cyclins [9], and is conserved during higher eukaryote evolution [10-17]. Previous studies have shown that Ccnb3-deleted females are sterile with oocytes unable to complete meiosis I in Drosophila [18], implying that Ccnb3 may have a special role in meiosis. To clarify the function of Ccnb3 in meiosis in mammalian species, we generated Ccnb3 mutant mice by CRISPR/Cas9, and found that Ccnb3 mutation caused female infertility with the failure of metaphase-anaphase transition in meiosis I. Ccnb3 was necessary for APC/C activation to initiate anaphase I, but not required for oocytes maturation, meiosis II progression, or early embryonic development. Our study reveals the differential cell cycle regulation between meiosis I and meiosis II, as well as meiosis between males and females, which shed light on the cell cycle control of meiosis.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIIdentification of a female meiosis-specific cyclin in mouse\\nC_LIO_LICyclin B3 is required for metaphase-anaphase transition in oocyte meiosis I\\nC_LIO_LICyclin B3 is not essential for oocyte maturation and sister chromosome segregation\\nC_LIO_LICyclin B3 is necessary for APC/C activation and MPF kinase activity through Cdk1\\nC_LI",

We develop a density profile-based method to capture the spatial relationship between gene expression and other morphological features of the tissue sample such as position of nuclei and endocrine cells of the pancreas. In addition, we build a statistical model to characterize correlations in the spatial distribution of the expression level among different genes. This model enables us to infer the inhibitory and clustering effects throughout different time points.

    "abstract": "The Apicomplexa are an important group of obligate intracellular parasites that include the causative agents of human diseases like malaria and toxoplasmosis. They evolved from free-living, phototrophic ancestors, and how this transition to parasitism occurred remains an outstanding question. One potential clue lies in coral reefs, where environmental DNA surveys have uncovered several lineages of uncharacterized, basally-branching apicomplexans. Reef-building corals form a well-studied symbiotic relationship with the photosynthetic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium, but identification of other key microbial symbionts of corals has proven elusive. Here, we used community surveys, genomics, and microscopy to identify an apicomplexan lineage, which we name  corallicola, that was found in high prevalence (>80%) across all major groups of corals. In-situ fluorescence and electron microscopy confirmed that corallicola lives intracellularly within the tissues of the coral gastric cavity, and possesses clear apicomplexan ultrastructural features. We sequenced the plastid genome, which lacked all genes for photosystem proteins, indicating that corallicola harbours a non-photosynthetic plastid (an apicoplast). However, the corallicola plastid differed from all other known apicoplasts because it retains all four genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis. Hence, corallicola shares characteristics with both its parasitic and free-living relatives, implicating it as an evolutionary intermediate, and suggesting that a unique ancestral biochemistry likely operated during the transition from phototrophy to parasitism.",

    "abstract": "The underlying intracellular mechanisms involved in the fungal growth received considerable attention, but the experimental and theoretical work did not take into account the modulation of these processes by constraining microenvironments similar to many natural fungal habitats. To fill this gap in the scientific knowledge, we used time-lapse live-cell imaging of Neurospora crassa growth in custom-built confining microfluidics environments. We show that the position and dynamics of the Spitzenkorper-microtubules system in constraining environments differs markedly from that associated with unconstrained growth. First, when hyphae encounter an obstacle at shallow angles, the Spitzenkorper moves from its central position in the apical dome off-axis towards a contact with the obstacle, thus functioning as a compass preserving the  directional memory of the initial growth. The trajectory of Spitzenkorper is also followed by microtubules, resulting in a  cutting corners pattern of the cytoskeleton in constrained geometries. Second, when an obstacle blocks a hypha at nearnormal incidence, the Spitzenkorper-microtubule system temporarily disintegrates, followed by the formation of two equivalent systems in the proto-hyphae - the basis of obstacle-induced branching. Third, a hypha, passing a lateral opening along a wall, continues to grow largely unperturbed while a lateral proto-hypha gradually branches into the opening, which starts forming its own Spitzenkorper-microtubule system. These observations suggest that the Spitzenkorper-microtubules system conserves the directional memory of the hyphae when they navigate around obstacles, but in the absence of the Spitzenkorper-microtubule system during constrainment-induced apical splitting and lateral branching, the probable driving force of obstacle-induced branching is the isotropic turgor pressure.",

Previous work used MEG decoding to investigate the influence of such category-based attention on the time course of object category representations. Attended object categories were more strongly represented than unattended categories from 180 ms after scene onset. In the present study, we used a similar approach to determine when, relative to this category-level modulation, attention is spatially focused on the target. Participants completed two tasks. In the first, they detected cars and people at varying locations in photographs of real-world scenes. In the second, they detected a cross that appeared at salient locations in an array of lines. Multivariate classifiers were trained on data of the artificial salience experiment and tested on data of the naturalistic visual search experiment. Results showed that the location of both target and distracter objects could be accurately decoded shortly after scene onset (50 ms). However, the emergence of spatial attentional selection - reflected in better decoding of target location than distracter location - emerged only later in time (240 ms). Target presence itself (irrespective of location and category) could be decoded from 180 ms after stimulus onset. Combined with earlier work, these results indicate that naturalistic category search operates through an initial spatially-global modulation of category processing that then guides attention to the location of the target.",

This raises the concern about the use of anesthesia in surgeries that precede psycopharmacological tests, since it may be a potential bias on results depending on the experimental design used.\\n\\nObjectivesTo evaluate whether commonly used general anesthetics in surgeries preceding psychopharmacological tests would affect rat behavior in tests predictive of antidepressant or anxiolytic-like effects. We also evaluated whether prior anesthesia would interfere in the detection of the antidepressant-like effect of imipramine or the anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam.\\n\\nMethodsWe tested if a single exposure to subanesthetic or anesthetic doses of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol, chloral hydrate, thiopental or isoflurane would change rats behavior in the forced swimming test (FST) or in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test, at 2 hours or 7 days after administration.\\n\\nResultsPrevious anesthesia with the aforementioned anesthetics did not change rat behavior in FST per se nor it changed the antidepressant-like effect induced by imipramine treatment. Rats previously anesthetized with tribromoethanol or chloral hydrate exhibited, respectively, anxiogenic-like or anxiolytic-like behavior in the EPM. Prior anesthesia with thiopental or isoflurane did not produce any per se effect in rat behavior in the EPM nor disturbed the anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam.\\n\\nConclusionOur results suggest that, in our experimental conditions, tribromoethanol and chloral hydrate are improper anesthetics for surgeries that precede behavioral tests related to anxiety. Isoflurane or thiopental may be suitable for anesthesia before evaluation in animal models predictive of antidepressant or anxiolytic-like effect.",

To study its role for human hearing, recent studies have instead correlated changes in basic supra-threshold psychoacoustic tasks with individual differences in subcortical EEG responses, as a proxy measure for synaptopathy. It is not clear whether the reported missing relationships between the psychoacoustic quantities and the EEG are due to the adopted methods, or to a minor role of synaptopathy for sound perception. We address this topic by studying the theoretical relationship between subcortical EEG and psychoacoustic methods for different sensorineural hearing deficits.",

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread occurrence of axon degeneration in the injured and diseased nervous system, the mechanisms of the degenerative process remain incompletely understood. In particular, the factors that regulate how individual axons degenerate within their native environment in the mammalian brain are unknown. Longitudinal imaging of >120 individually injured cortical axons revealed a threshold length below which injured axons undergo a rapid-onset form of Wallerian degeneration (ROWD). ROWD consistently starts 10 times earlier and is executed 4 times slower than classic Wallerian degeneration (WD). ROWD is dependent on synaptic density, unlike WD, but is independent of axon complexity. Finally, we provide both pharmacological and genetic evidence that a Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent pathway controls cortical axon ROWD independent of transcription in the damaged neurons. Thus, our data redefine the therapeutic window for intervention to maintain neurological function in injured cortical neurons, and support the use of in vivo optical imaging to gain unique insights into the mechanisms of axon degeneration in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Patterns of gene expression are primarily determined by proteins that locally enhance or repress transcription. While many transcription factors target a restricted number of genes, others appear to modulate transcription levels globally. An example is MeCP2, an abundant methylated-DNA binding protein that is mutated in the neurological disorder Rett Syndrome. Despite much research, the molecular mechanism by which MeCP2 regulates gene expression is not fully resolved. Here we integrate quantitative, multi-dimensional experimental analysis and mathematical modelling to show that MeCP2 is a novel type of global transcriptional regulator whose binding to DNA creates \"slow sites\" in gene bodies. Waves of slowed-down RNA polymerase II formed behind these sites travel backward and indirectly affect initiation, reminiscent of defect-induced shock waves in non-equilibrium physics transport models. This mechanism differs from conventional gene regulation mechanisms, which often involve direct modulation of transcription initiation. Our findings uncover a genome-wide function of DNA methylation that may account for the reversibility of Rett syndrome in mice. Moreover, our combined theoretical and experimental approach provides a general method for understanding how global gene expression patterns are choreographed.",

    "abstract": "Chemical detection is key to various behaviours in both marine and terrestrial animals. Marine species, though highly diverse, have been underrepresented so far in studies on chemosensory systems, and our knowledge mostly concerns the detection of airborne cues. A broader comparative approach is therefore desirable. Marine annelid worms with their rich behavioural repertoire represent attractive models for chemosensory studies. Here, we study the marine worm Platynereis dumerilii to provide the first comprehensive study of head chemosensory organ physiology in an annelid. By combining microfluidics and calcium imaging, we record neuronal activity in the entire head of early juveniles upon chemical stimulation. We find that Platynereis uses four types of organs to detect stimuli such as alcohols, esters, amino acids and sugars. Antennae, but not nuchal organs or palps as generally hypothesised in annelids, are the main chemosensory organs. We report chemically-evoked activity in possible downstream brain regions including the mushroom bodies, which are anatomically and molecularly similar to insect mushroom bodies. We conclude that chemosensation is a major sensory modality for marine annelids, and propose early Platynereis juveniles as a model to study annelid chemosensory systems.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=184 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/391920_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (74K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4384corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10c2563org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6a8a32org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@96f06c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Consistent with reduced regularity of grid patterns in rodents and a grid-cell model based on the eigenvectors of the successor representation, human positional memory was degraded in a trapezoid compared to a square environment; an effect particularly pronounced in the trapezoids narrow part. Congruent with spatial frequency changes of eigenvector grid patterns, distance estimates between remembered positions were persistently biased; revealing distorted memory maps that explained behavior better than the objective maps. Our findings demonstrate that environmental geometry affects human spatial memory similarly to rodent grid cell activity -- thus strengthening the putative link between grid cells and behavior along with their cognitive functions beyond navigation.",

Computational analysis of transcriptomics data from human cancer specimens, complemented with exhaustive clinical annotation, provides an opportunity to identify core regulators of the tumorigenic process. Here we exploit well-annotated clinical datasets of prostate cancer for the discovery of transcriptional regulators relevant to prostate cancer. Following this rationale, we identify Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) as a prostate tumor suppressor among a subset of transcription factors. Importantly, we further interrogate transcriptomics and clinical data to refine MITF perturbation-based empirical assays and unveil Crystallin Alpha B (CRYAB) as an unprecedented direct target of the transcription factor that is, at least in part, responsible for its tumor suppressive activity in prostate cancer. This evidence was supported by the enhanced prognostic potential of a signature based on the concomitant alteration of MITF and CRYAB in prostate cancer patients. In sum, our study provides proof-of-concept evidence of the potential of the bioinformatics screen of publicly available cancer patient databases as discovery platforms, and demonstrates that the MITF-CRYAB axis controls prostate cancer biology.",

Here, we use climate-manipulation experiments, Pan-European long-term (>15 years) observations, and common garden monitoring data on up to 72 woody and herbaceous species to study the effects of increasing temperatures on the extent of within-population leaf-out and flowering synchrony. Warmer temperatures reduce in situ leaf-out and flowering synchrony by up to 55%, and experiments on European beech provide a mechanism for how individual genetic differences may explain this finding. The rapid loss of reproductive and vegetative synchrony in European plants predicts changes in their gene flow and trophic interactions, but community-wide consequences remain largely unknown.",

    "abstract": "Fc glycosylation of human immunoglobulins G (IgGs) is essential for their structural integrity and activity. Interestingly, the specific nature of the Fc glycoforms is known to modulate the IgG effector function. Indeed, while core-fucosylation of IgG Fc-glycans greatly affects the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) function, with obvious repercussions in the design of therapeutic antibodies, sialylation can reverse the antibody inflammatory response, and galactosylation levels have been linked to aging, to the onset of inflammation, and to the predisposition to rheumatoid arthritis. Within the framework of a structure-to-function relationship, we have studied the role of the N-glycan sequence on its intrinsic conformational propensity. Here we report the results of a systematic study, based on extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in excess of 62 {micro}s of cumulative simulation time, on the effect of sequence on the structure and dynamics of increasingly larger, complex biantennary N-glycoforms, i.e. from chitobiose to the larger N-glycan species commonly found in the Fc region of human IgGs. Our results show that while core fucosylation and sialylation do not affect the intrinsic dynamics of the isolated (unbound) N-glycans, galactosylation of the (1-6) arm shifts dramatically its conformational equilibrium from an outstretched to a folded conformation. These findings are in agreement with and can help rationalize recent experimental evidence showing a differential recognition of positional isomers in glycan array data and also the preference of sialyltransferase for the more reachable, outstretched (1-3) arm in both isolated and Fc-bound N-glycans.",

To identify the sites of K63 ubiquitin, we developed a new mass-spectrometry based method that quantified >1,100 K63 ubiquitination sites in yeast responding to oxidative stress induced by H2O2. We determined that under stress, K63 ubiquitin modified proteins involved in several cellular functions including ion transport, protein trafficking, and translation. The most abundant ubiquitination sites localized to the head of the 40S subunit of the ribosome, modified assembled polysomes, and affected the binding of translation factors. The results suggested a new pathway of post-initiation control of translation during oxidative stress and illustrated the importance of high-resolution mapping of noncanonical ubiquitination events.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSymbiotic bacteria are pervasive in mosquitoes and their presence can influence many host phenotypes that affect vectoral capacity. While it is evident that environmental and host genetic factors contribute in shaping the microbiome of mosquitoes, we have a poor understanding regarding how bacterial genetics affects colonization of the mosquito gut. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system is a powerful tool to alter bacterial genomes facilitating investigations into host-microbe interactions but has yet to be applied to insect symbionts.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsTo investigate the role of bacterial factors in mosquito biology and in colonization of mosquitoes we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to mutate the outer membrane protein A (ompA) gene of an Enterobacter symbiont isolated from Aedes mosquitoes. The ompA mutant had an impaired ability to form biofilms and poorly infected Ae. aegypti when reared in a mono-association under gnotobiotic conditions. In adults the mutant had a significantly reduced infection prevalence compared to the wild type or complement strains, while no differences in prevalence were seen in larvae, suggesting bacterial genetic factors are particularly important for adult gut colonization. We also used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to integrate genes (antibiotic resistance and fluorescent markers) into these symbionts genome and demonstrated that these genes were functional in vitro and in vivo.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceOur results shed insights onto the role of ompA gene in host-microbe interactions in Ae. aegypti and confirm that CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing can be employed for genetic manipulation of non-model gut microbes. The ability to use this technology for site-specific integration of genes into the symbiont will facilitate the development of paratransgenic control strategies to interfere with arboviral pathogens such Chikungunya, dengue, Zika and Yellow fever viruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes.\n\nAuthor summaryMicrobiota profoundly affect their host but few studies have investigated the role of bacterial genetics in host-microbe interactions in mosquitoes. Here we applied the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to knock out a membrane protein in Enterobacter, which is a dominant member of the mosquito microbiome. The mutant strain lacked the capacity to form biofilms, infected larvae and adults at lower titers, and had a reduced prevalence in adults. The lower prevalence in adults, but not larvae, likely reflects the difference in the modes of bacterial acquisition from the larval water of these two life stages. Importantly from an applied perspective, we also demonstrated that this editing technology can be harnessed for site-specific integration of genes into the bacterial chromosome. In proof-of-principle studies we integrated either a fluorescent protein or gene conferring antibiotic resistance into the bacterial genome and showed these transgenes were functional in mosquitoes. The specificity, flexibility, and simplicity of this editing approach in non-model bacteria will be useful for developing novel symbiotic control strategies to control arthropod-borne disease.",

    "abstract": "The manipulation of pattern generators in order to impose temporal organization on target nodes while accounting for dynamic changes in behavior and cognitive demand remains a significant challenge for the use of neurostimulation as a therapeutic treatment option. While perturbation through optogentic stimulation can reveal circuit mechanisms that create and locally integrate temporal organization, it is unclear whether superseding endogenous signals with artificial oscillations would benefit or impede hippocampus-dependent cognition or how cognitive demand might affect artificial septo-hippocampal entrainment. Optogenetic MS stimulation in wild-type rats in 3 conditions showed that septal input is more likely to supersede endogenous hippocampal LFP oscillations when animals are at rest or performing a hippocampus-dependent spatial accuracy task. Stimulation during a hippocampus-independent task, however, resulted in compensatory endogenous oscillations. Although stimulation effects on the inter-spike interval of hippocampal pyramidal cells mirrored task-conditional theta entrainment of the LFP, place field properties were unaffected. Analyses of spatial behavior indicate that optogenetic stimulation can attenuate performance and specific measures of goal zone estimation accuracy but otherwise does not affect the rats ability to navigate to the target quadrant. The results suggest that the behavioral effect of temporally organizing the septo-hippocampal circuit relative to an artificial theta signal is limited to the accuracy of the rats approximation of the goal zone location. These results have significant implications for the therapeutic use of optogenetic stimulation as a means of attenuating cognitive deficits associated with temporal discoordination.",

Here we show that iridoid synthase, an atypical reductive terpene synthase, catalyses the activation of its substrate 8-oxogeranial into a reactive enol intermediate but does not catalyse the subsequent cyclisation into nepetalactol. This discovery led us to identify a class of nepetalactol-related short-chain dehydrogenase enzymes (NEPS) from catmint (Nepeta mussinii) which catalyse the stereoselective cyclisation of the enol intermediate into nepetalactol isomers. Subsequent oxidation of nepetalactols by NEPS1 provides nepetalactones, metabolites that are well known for both insect-repellent activity and euphoric effect in cats. Structural characterisation of the NEPS3 cyclase reveals it binds to NAD+ yet does not utilise it chemically for a non-oxidoreductive formal [4+2] cyclisation.

    "abstract": "A growing body of research suggests that the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is important for temperature adaptation. In the yeast genus Saccharomyces, species have diverged in temperature tolerance, driving their use in high or low temperature fermentations. Here we experimentally test the role of mtDNA in temperature tolerance in synthetic and industrial hybrids (Saccharomyces cerevisiae x Saccharomyces eubayanus, or Saccharomyces pastorianus), which cold-brew lager beer. We find that the relative temperature tolerances of hybrids correspond to the parent donating mtDNA, allowing us to modulate lager strain temperature preferences. The strong influence of mitotype on the temperature tolerance of otherwise identical hybrid strains provides support for the mitochondrial climactic adaptation hypothesis in yeasts and demonstrates how mitotype has influenced the world's most commonly fermented beverage.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryMitochondrial genome origin affects the temperature tolerance of synthetic and industrial lager-brewing yeast hybrids.",

    "abstract": "CC Chemokine Receptor 2 (CCR2) is a part of the chemokine receptor family, an important class of therapeutic targets. These class A G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in mammalian signaling pathways and control cell migration toward endogenous CC chemokine ligands. Chemokine receptors and their associated ligands are involved in a wide range of diseases and thus have become important drug targets. Of particular interest is CCR2, which has been implicated in cancer, autoimmunity driven type-1 diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, multiple sclerosis, asthma, atherosclerosis, neuropathic pain, and rheumatoid arthritis. Although promising, CCR2 antagonists have been largely unsuccessful to date. Here, we investigate the effect of an orthosteric and an allosteric antagonist on CCR2 dynamics by coupling long timescale molecular dynamics simulations with Markov-state model theory. We find that the antagonists shift CCR2 into several stable inactive conformations that are distinct from the crystal structure conformation, and that they disrupt a continuous internal water and sodium ion pathway preventing transitions to an active-like state. Several of these stable conformations contain a putative drug binding pocket that may be amenable to targeting with another small molecule antagonist. In the absence of antagonists, the apo dynamics reveal intermediate conformations along the activation pathway that provide insight into the basal dynamics of CCR2, and may also be useful for future drug design.",

    "abstract": "miR-203 is a tumor-suppressor microRNA with known functions in cancer metastasis. Here, we explore its normal developmental role in the context of neural crest development. As neural crest cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition to emigrate from the neural tube, miR-203 displays a reciprocal expression pattern with key regulators of neural crest delamination, Phf12 and Snail2, and interacts with their 3UTRs. Ectopic maintenance of miR-203 inhibits neural crest migration, whereas its functional inhibition using a \\\"sponge\\\" vector promotes premature neural crest delamination. Bisulfite sequencing further shows that epigenetic repression of miR-203 is mediated by the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, whose recruitment to regulatory regions on the miR-203 locus is directed by SNAIL2 in a negative feedback loop. These findings reveal an important role for miR-203 in an epigenetic-microRNA regulatory network that influences the timing of neural crest delamination.\\n\\nSummary statementThe EMT is a highly conserved process, involving similar levels of regulation in both neural crest and cancer cells. Our work shows an epigenetic-miRNA-gene regulatory circuit, conserved in cancer, which controls the timing of neural crest EMT as well.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulation is important for cells and tissues to function. At the genomic level, it has been studied from two aspects, the identification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and identification of long-range chromatin interactions. It is important to understand their relationship, such as whether eQTLs regulate their target genes through physical chromatin interaction. Although previous studies have suggested enrichment of eQTLs in regions with a high chromatin interaction frequency, it is unclear whether this relationship is consistent across different tissues and cell lines and whether there would be any tissue-specific patterns. Here, we performed integrative analyses of eQTL and high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) data from 11 human primary tissue types and 2 human cell lines. We found that chromatin interaction frequency is positively correlated with the number of genes having eQTLs, and eQTLs and their target genes are more likely to fall in the same topologically associating domains than that expected from randomly generated control datasets. These results are consistent across all tissues and cell lines we evaluated. Moreover, in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, spleen, hippocampus, pancreas and aorta, tissue-specific eQTLs are enriched in tissue-specific frequently interacting regions. These results reveal a more detailed picture of the complicated relationship between different mechanisms of gene regulation.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWhole-genome gene regulation has been studied in tissues and cell lines from multiple perspectives, including identification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and identification of long-range chromatin interactions. These two complementary approaches focus on different aspects of gene regulation, one being statistical across individuals while the other being physical within a sample. Integrating results from these two approaches will help us understand their relationships, such as whether eQTLs regulate their target genes through physical chromatin interaction. We performed comprehensive analyses using data from multiple human tissues and cell lines, and showed that chromatin interaction frequency is positively associated with eQTL results in all evaluated tissues and cell lines. The observed relationships also displayed tissue-specific pattern in some tissues. Our results revealed a more detailed picture of the complicated relationship between the different mechanisms of gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "MeCP2 - a chromatin-binding protein associated with Rett syndrome - has two main isoforms, MeCP2-E1 and MeCP2-E2, with 96% amino acid identity differing in a few N-terminal amino acid residues. Previous studies have shown brain region-specific expression of these isoforms which, in addition to their different cellular localization and differential expression during brain development, suggest they may also have non-overlapping molecular mechanisms. However, differential functions of MeCP2-E1 and E2 remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that the N-terminal domains (NTD) of MeCP2-E1 and E2 modulate the ability of the methyl binding domain (MBD) to interact with DNA as well as influencing the turnover rates, binding dynamics, response to nuclear depolarization, and circadian oscillations of the two isoforms. Our proteomics data indicate that both isoforms exhibit unique interacting protein partners. Moreover, genome-wide analysis using ChIP-seq provide evidence for a shared as well as a specific regulation of different sets of genes. Our findings provide insight into the functional complexity of MeCP2 by dissecting differential aspects of its two isoforms.\\n\\nSignificanceWhether the two E1 and E2 isoforms of MeCP2 have different structural and/or functional implications has been highly controversial and is not well known. Here we show that the relatively short N-terminal sequence variation between the two isoforms impinges them with an important DNA binding difference. Moreover, MeCP2-E1 and E2 exhibit a different cellular dynamic behavior and have some distinctive interacting partners. In addition, while sharing genome occupancy they specifically bind to several distinctive genes.",

    "abstract": "Across languages, the speech signal is characterized by a predominant modulation of the amplitude spectrum between about 4.3-5.5Hz, reflecting the production and processing of linguistic information chunks (syllables, words) every [~]200ms. Interestingly, [~]200ms is also the typical duration of eye fixations during reading. Prompted by this observation, we demonstrate that German readers sample written text at [~]5Hz. A subsequent meta-analysis with 142 studies from 14 languages replicates this result, but also shows that sampling frequencies vary across languages between 3.9Hz and 5.2Hz, and that this variation systematically depends on the complexity of the writing systems (character-based vs. alphabetic systems, orthographic transparency). Finally, we demonstrate empirically a positive correlation between speech spectrum and eye-movement sampling in low-skilled readers. Based on this convergent evidence, we propose that during reading, our brains linguistic processing systems imprint a preferred processing rate, i.e., the rate of spoken language production and perception, onto the oculomotor system.",

    "abstract": "Causal reasoning is a principal higher-cognitive ability of humans, however, much remains unknown, including (a) the type (systematic versus intermixed) and order (inductive-then-deductive or vice versa) of experience that best achieves causal-chain extraction; (b) how inferences generalize to novel problems, especially with one-shot experience; and (c) how metacognition, reflected in uncertainty of ones knowledge, relates to actual knowledge. We tested people on a realistic cancer biology task (e.g.,  seroc chemicals inducing tumors with subsequent effects). Systematic experience was superior, with some evidence that the inductive-then-deductive order promoted stronger one-shot generalization. Notably, uncertainty was decoupled from actual knowledge, with the deductive-then-inductive group being overconfident, likely reflecting lack of awareness of the inductive component; while those with successful one-shot generalization held lower confidence, reflecting generalization with minimal experience, while remaining skeptical. Our findings clarify processes underlying causal reasoning, and reveal a complex relationship between causal reasoning and metacognitive awareness of it.",

    "abstract": "Cafeteria (CAF) diet-fed rodents are shown to provide a robust model of metabolic syndrome and human obesity. The carbohydrate/fat-rich food-items provided to the CAF-diet-model more closely approximate the ultra-processed human diet. However, most of the previous studies applied the commercially available rodent chow-diet for the comparative analyses and labeled it as a healthy-diet. The presented work aims to extend the knowledge on CAF-diet model by exposing the mice to human foods with different nutritional values. Our major goal was to study the metabolic fates of mice maintained on human food-items, which depending upon on their macronutrient compositions are categorized as healthy or unhealthy. BALB/c mice were randomly allocated to one of the three dietary intervention groups, standard chow diet; high-sugar/high-fat-cafeteria (HSHF-CAF) diet; or low-sugar/low-fat-cafeteria (LSLF-CAF) diet, for 5 weeks. The differences in multiple metabolic parameters (including food-/energy /macronutrient-intake, body-weight gain rate, organ-to-body weight ratios, plasma lipid profiles, adipocyte physiology, lipid deposition in metabolic tissues and ectopic fat storage in heart and kidney) were compared among the three intervention groups. We did not observe hyperphagia in mice maintained on CAF-diets. Nonetheless, the CAF-diet-fed mice displayed increased weight-gain-rate, adiposity, and adipocyte hypertrophy when compared to the chow-fed mice. However, the mice maintained on the two cafeteria-style diets displayed similar metabolic profiles, with HSHF-CAF-group displaying slightly higher weight-gain-rate. The HSHF-CAF-and LSLF-CAF-diet induced comparable adiposity in BALB/c mice. Further studies, with longer dietary intervention periods, are required to elucidate the effects of differential CAF-diets on the metabolic health of mice.",

It is unclear, however, whether a putatively domain-general valuation network implicated in other cost domains also encodes the subjective value (SV) of cognitive effort. Here, we demonstrate that a valuation network, centered on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum, also encodes SV during cognitive effort-based decision-making. We doubly dissociate this network from a primarily frontoparietal network recruited as a function of decision difficulty. We also find evidence that SV signals predict choice and are influenced by state and trait motivation, including sensitivity to reward and anticipated task performance. These findings unify cognitive effort with other cost domains, and inform physiological mechanisms of SV representations underlying the willingness to expend cognitive effort.",
