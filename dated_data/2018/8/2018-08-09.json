    "abstract": "Vision formation is classically based on projections from the retinal ganglion cells (RGC) to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex (V1). Although the cellular information of the retina and the LGN has been widely studied, the transcriptome profiles of single neurons with specific functions in V1 still remain unknown. Some neurons in mouse V1 are tuned to light stimulus. To determine the molecular properties of light-stimulated neurons in layer 2/3 of V1, we developed a method of functional in vivo single-cell transcriptome (FIST) analysis that integrates sensory evoked calcium imaging, whole-cell electrophysiological patch-clamp recordings, single-cell mRNA sequencing and three-dimensional morphological characterization in a live mouse, based on a two-photon microscope system. In our study, 58 individual cells from layer 2/3 of V1 were identified as either light-sensitive (LS) or non-light-sensitive (NS) by single-cell light-evoked calcium evaluation and action potential spiking. The contents of every single cell after individual functional tests were aspirated through the patch-clamp pipette for mRNA sequencing. Furthermore, the three-dimensional (3-D) morphological characterizations of the neurons were reconstructed in the live mouse after the whole-cell recordings. Our sequencing results indicated that V1 neurons with high expression of genes related to transmission regulation, such as Rtn4r, Nr4a1, and genes involved in membrane transport, such as Na+/K+ ATPase, NMDA-type glutamatergic receptor, preferentially respond to light stimulation. Our findings demonstrate the ability of FIST analysis to characterize the functional, morphological and transcriptomic properties of a single cell in alive animal, thereby providing precise neuronal information and predicting its network contribution in the brain.",

    "abstract": "The genetic basis and uniquely human character of schizophrenia has led to the notion of human brain evolution to have resulted in vulnerability to the disorder. We examined schizophrenia-related changes in brain connectivity in the context of evolutionary changes in human brain wiring by comparing in-vivo neuroimaging data from humans, chimpanzees and macaque monkeys. We find that evolutionary changes in human connectome organization overlap with the pattern of schizophrenia-related changes in brain connectivity, with connections evolutionary enhanced in the human brain showing significantly more involvement in schizophrenia pathology than connections shared between humans and non-human primates (effects shown in three independent patient-control datasets). Our findings suggest that the evolution of brain wiring in support of complex brain function in humans may have come at the cost of an increased vulnerability to brain dysfunction in disease.",

    "abstract": "Acetylation of histones plays a critical role in maintaining the epigenetic state of the eukaryotic cell. One such acetylation site critical for DNA damage repair is H3K56ac. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, H3K56ac is thought to be driven mainly by Rtt109, a lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) that associates with the histone chaperones Vps75 and Asf1. Both of these chaperones can increase the specificity of histone acetylation by Rtt109, but neither alter the selectivity. It has been shown that histones extracted from cells (Drosophila), presumably containing pre-acetylated histones, can incorporate higher amounts of H3K56ac relative to recombinant non-acetylated histones. We hypothesized that histone pre-acetylation and histone chaperones could function together to drive acetylation of H3K56. In the present study, we test this hypothesis using a series of singly acetylated histones to determine the impact of crosstalk on enzyme selectivity. Our data suggest that crosstalk between acetylation sites plays a major role in altering the selectivity of Rtt109-Vps75 and that the histone chaperone Asf1 mediates this crosstalk. Specifically, we show that H3K14ac/H4 functions with Asf1 to drive H3K56ac by Rtt109-Vps75. We identified an acidic patch in Asf1 that mediates this cross-talk and show that mutations to this region can alter the Asf1 mediated crosstalk that changes Rtt109-Vps75 selectivity. These data explain the genetic link between Gcn5, which acetylates H3K14 and Rtt109. More broadly these data demonstrate that acetylation sites can dictate site selectivity even in the absence of a bromodomain and helps to explain the limited complexity that has been observed of the histone post-translational modifications patterns by global proteomic studies.",

As the number of laboratories and studies implementing this technology expands, the accurate assessment of cell identity in differentiation cultures is paramount to well-defined studies that can be replicated among laboratories. While flow cytometry is apt for routine assessment, a standardized protocol for assessing cardiomyocyte identity in hPSC-CM cultures has not yet been established. To address this gap, the current study leveraged targeted mass spectrometry to confirm the presence of troponin proteins in hPSC-CM and systematically evaluated multiple anti-troponin antibodies and sample preparation protocols for their suitability in assessing cardiomyocyte identity. Results demonstrate challenges of interpreting data generated by published methods and informed the development of a robust protocol for routine assessment of hPSC-CM. Overall, the new data, workflow for evaluating fit-for-purpose use of antibodies, and standardized protocol described here should benefit investigators new to this field as well as those with expertise in hPSC-CM differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Danforths short tail (Sd) mice provide an excellent model for investigating the underlying etiology of human caudal birth defects, which affect 1 in 10,000 live births. Sd animals exhibit aberrant axial skeleton, urogenital, and gastrointestinal development similar to human caudal malformation syndromes including urorectal septum malformation, caudal regression, VACTERL association, and persistent cloaca. Previous studies have shown that the Sd mutation results from an endogenous retroviral (ERV) insertion upstream of the Ptf1a gene resulting in its ectopic expression at E9.5. Though the genetic lesion has been determined, the resulting epigenomic and transcriptomic changes driving the phenotype have not been investigated. Here, we performed ATAC-seq experiments on isolated E9.5 tailbud tissue, which revealed minimal changes in chromatin accessibility in Sd/Sd mutant embryos. Interestingly, chromatin changes were localized to a small interval adjacent to the Sd ERV insertion overlapping a known Ptf1a enhancer region, which is conserved in mice and humans. Furthermore, mRNA-seq experiments revealed increased transcription of PTF1A target genes and, importantly, downregulation of hedgehog pathway genes. Reduced sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling was confirmed by in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence suggesting that the Sd phenotype results, in part, from downregulated SHH signaling. Taken together, these data demonstrate substantial transcriptome changes in the Sd mouse, and indicate that the effect of the ERV insertion on Ptf1a expression may be mediated by increased chromatin accessibility at a conserved Ptf1a enhancer. We propose that human caudal dysgenesis disorders may result from dysregulation of hedgehog signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Indigenous cattle breeds in northern Eurasia have adapted to harsh climate conditions. The local breeds are important genetic resources with cultural and historical heritages, and therefore, their preservation and genetic characterization are important. In this study, we aim to identify genes and biological processes that are important for their adaptation to the cold and harsh conditions. For this purpose, we profiled the whole-blood transcriptome of two native breeds and one commercial breed using high-throughput RNA sequencing. More than 15,000 genes were identified, of which 2, 89, and 162 genes were significantly upregulated exclusively in Northern Finncattle, Yakutian cattle and Holstein cattle, respectively. The functional classification of these significantly differentially expressed genes identified several biological processes and pathways related to signalling mechanisms, cell differentiation, and host-pathogen interactions that, in general, point towards immunity and disease resistance mechanisms. The gene expression pattern observed in Northern Finncattle was more similar to that of Yakutian cattle, despite sharing similar living conditions as the Holstein cattle included in our study. In conclusion, our study identified unique biological processes in these breeds that help them to adapt and survive in sub-arctic environments.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between the genome of a cell and its phenotype is a central problem in precision medicine. Nonetheless, genotype-to-phenotype prediction comes with great challenges for machine learning algorithms that limit their use in this setting. The high dimensionality of the data tends to hinder generalization and challenges the scalability of most learning algorithms. Additionally, most algorithms produce models that are complex and difficult to interpret. We alleviate these limitations by proposing strong performance guarantees, based on sample compression theory, for rule-based learning algorithms that produce highly interpretable models. We show that these guarantees can be leveraged to accelerate learning and improve model interpretability. Our approach is validated through an application to the genomic prediction of antimicrobial resistance, an important public health concern. Highly accurate models were obtained for 12 species and 56 antibiotics, and their interpretation revealed known resistance mechanisms, as well as some potentially new ones. An open-source disk-based implementation that is both memory and computationally efficient is provided with this work. The implementation is turnkey, requires no prior knowledge of machine learning, and is complemented by comprehensive tutorials.",

We report a comprehensive genomic analysis of 28 cases of SARCs and 84 cases of conventional urothelial carcinomas (UCs), with the TCGA cohort of 408 muscle-invasive bladder cancers serving as the reference. SARCs showed a distinct mutational landscape with enrichment of TP53, RB1, and PIK3CA mutations. They were related to the basal molecular subtype of conventional UCs and could be divided into epithelial/basal and more clinically aggressive mesenchymal subsets based on TP63 and its target genes expression levels. Other analyses revealed that SARCs are driven by downregulation of homotypic adherence genes and dysregulation of cell cycle and EMT networks, and nearly half exhibited a heavily infiltrated immune phenotype. Our observations have important implications for prognostication and the development of more effective therapies for this highly lethal variant of bladder cancer.",

    "abstract": "UNC-13 proteins play an essential role in synaptic transmission by recruiting synaptic vesicles (SVs) to become available for release, which is termed SV priming. Here we show that the C2A domain of UNC-13L, like the corresponding domain in mammalian Munc13-1, displays two conserved binding modes: forming C2A/C2A homodimers, or forming a heterodimer with the zinc finger domain of UNC-10/RIM (C2A/RIM). Functional analysis revealed that UNC-13Ls C2A promotes synaptic transmission by regulating a post-priming process. Stimulus-evoked release but not SV priming, was impaired in unc-10 mutants deficient for C2A/RIM heterodimerization, leading to decreased release probability. Disrupting C2A/C2A homodimerization in UNC-13L-rescued animals had no effect on synaptic transmission, but fully restored the evoked release and the release probability of unc-10/RIM mutants deficient for C2A/RIM heterodimerization. Thus, our results support the model that RIM binding C2A releases UNC-13L from an autoinhibitory homodimeric complex to become fusion-competent by functioning as a switch only.",

    "abstract": "Listeners use the slow amplitude modulations of speech, known as the envelope, to segment continuous speech into syllables. However, the underlying neural computations are heavily debated. We used high-density intracranial cortical recordings while participants listened to natural and synthesized control speech stimuli to determine how the envelope is represented in the human superior temporal gyrus (STG), a critical auditory brain area for speech processing. We found that the STG does not encode the instantaneous, moment-by-moment amplitude envelope of speech. Rather, a zone of the middle STG detects discrete acoustic onset edges, defined by local maxima in the rate-of-change of the envelope. Acoustic analysis demonstrated that acoustic onset edges reliably cue the information-rich transition between the consonant-onset and vowel-nucleus of syllables. Furthermore, the steepness of the acoustic edge cued whether a syllable was stressed. Synthesized amplitude-modulated tone stimuli showed that steeper edges elicited monotonically greater cortical responses, confirming the encoding of relative but not absolute amplitude. Overall, encoding of the timing and magnitude of acoustic onset edges in STG underlies our perception of the syllabic rhythm of speech.",

Here we show that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBE2G1 and UBE2D3 cooperatively promote the polyubiquitination of CRL4CRBN neomorphic substrates in a cereblon- and CM-dependent manner via a sequential ubiquitination mechanism: UBE2D3 transforms the neomorphic substrates into mono-ubiquitinated forms, upon which UBE2G1 catalyzes K48-linked polyubiquitin chain extension. Blockade of UBE2G1 diminishes the ubiquitination and degradation of neomorphic substrates, and consequent antitumor activities elicited by all tested CMs. For example, UBE2G1 inactivation significantly attenuated the degradation of myeloma survival factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 induced by lenalidomide and pomalidomide, hence conferring drug resistance. UBE2G1-deficient myeloma cells, however, remained sensitive to a more potent IKZF1/3 degrader CC-220. Collectively, these findings suggest that loss of UBE2G1 activity might be a resistance mechanism to drugs that hijack the CRL4CRBN to eliminate disease-driving proteins, and that this resistance mechanism can be overcome by next-generation CMs that destroy the same targeted protein more effectively.",

The use of ChIP-seq peaks as positive training data can be problematic due to high degrees of indirectly bound regions, and often poor overlap between experimental conditions.\\n\\nHere we explore meta-analysis of ChIP-seq data to generate high-quality training data for enhancer modeling. Our method is based on rank aggregation and identifies a core set of directly bound regions per transcription factor, exploiting between five and twenty ChIP-seq data sets per factor. We applied this method to six different transcription factors, namely TP53, REST, SOX2, GRHL2, HIF1A and PPARG. Sequence analysis and modeling of recurrently bound enhancers yielded distinct enhancer features for the different factors, whereby binding sites of REST and TP53 are strongly determined by their motif; binding of GRHL2 and SOX2 is determined by nucleosome positioning; and binding of PPARG and HIF1A depends on other transcription factors. In conclusion, meta-analysis of ChIP-seq peaks, and centering on motifs, allowed discovering new properties of transcription factor binding.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian inner ear possesses functional and morphological innovations that contribute to its unique hearing capacities. The genetic bases underlying the evolution of this mammalian landmark are poorly understood. We propose that the emergence of morphological and functional innovations in the mammalian inner ear could have been driven by adaptive molecular evolution.\\n\\nIn this work, we analyzed the complete inner ear transcriptome in order to identify genes that show signatures of adaptive evolution in this lineage. We analyzed approximately 1,300 inner ear expressed genes and found that 13 % show signatures of positive selection in the mammalian lineage. Several of these genes are known to play an important function in the inner ear. In addition, we identified that a significant proportion of genes showing signatures of adaptive evolution in mammals have not been previously reported to participate in inner ear development and/or physiology. We focused our analysis in two of these novel genes: STRIP2 and ABLIM2 by generating null mutant mice and analyzed their auditory function. We found that mice lacking Strip2 displayed a decrease in neural response amplitudes. In addition, we observed a reduction in the number of afferent synapses, suggesting a potential cochlear neuropathy.\\n\\nThus, this study shows the usefulness of pursuing a high-throughput evolutionary approach followed by functional studies to track down novel genes that are important for inner ear function. Moreover, this approach sheds light on the genetic basis underlying the evolution of the mammalian inner ear.",

We identified 90 independent genome-wide significant signals across 78 loci, including 38 independent risk signals in 37 novel loci. These variants explained 26-36% of the heritable risk of PD. Tests of causality within a Mendelian randomization framework identified putatively causal genes for 70 risk signals. Tissue expression enrichment analysis suggested that signatures of PD loci were heavily brain-enriched, consistent with specific neuronal cell types being implicated from single cell expression data. We found significant genetic correlations with brain volumes, smoking status, and educational attainment. In sum, these data provide the most comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture of PD to date by revealing many additional PD risk loci, providing a biological context for these risk factors, and demonstrating that a considerable genetic component of this disease remains unidentified.",

Predicting the functional effects of disease-associated protein-coding variants is increasingly routine. Yet the vast majority of risk variants are non-coding, and predicting the functional consequence and prioritizing variants for functional validation remains a major challenge. Here we develop a deep learning model to accurately predict locus-specific signals from four epigenetic assays using only DNA sequence as input. Given the predicted epigenetic signal from DNA sequence for the reference and alternative alleles at a given locus, we generate a score of the predicted epigenetic consequences for 438 million variants. These impact scores are assay-specific, are predictive of allele-specific transcription factor binding and are enriched for variants associated with gene expression and disease risk. Nucleotide-level functional consequence scores for non-coding variants can refine the mechanism of known causal variants, identify novel risk variants and prioritize downstream experiments.",

Video data provides a rich but high-dimensional representation of behaviour and so the first step of analysis is often some form of tracking and feature extraction to reduce dimensionality while maintaining relevant information. Modern machine learning methods are powerful but notoriously difficult to interpret, while handcrafted features are interpretable but do not always perform as well. Here we report a new set of handcrafted features to compactly quantify C. elegans behaviour. The features are designed to be interpretable but to capture as much of the phenotypic differences between worms as possible. We show that the full feature set is more powerful than a previously defined feature set in classifying mutant strains. We then use a combination of automated and manual feature selection to define a core set of interpretable features that still provides sufficient power to detect behavioural differences between mutant strains and the wild type. Finally, we apply the new features to detect time-resolved behavioural differences in a series of optogenetic experiments targeting different neural subsets.",

We identified novel roles for Sclerostin domain containing-1 (Sostdc1) in NK cell development and function. Sostdc1-knockout (Sostdc1-/-) mice display a progressive accumulation of transitional NK cells (CD27+CD11b+, tNK) with age, indicating a partial developmental block. The Ly49 repertoire on NK cells in Sostdc1-/- mice is also changed. Lower frequencies of Sostdc1-/- splenic tNKs express inhibitory Ly49G2 receptors, but higher frequencies express activating Ly49H and Ly49D receptors. However, the frequencies of Ly49I+, G2+, H+ and D+ populations were universally decreased at the most mature (CD27-CD11b+, mNK) stage. We hypothesized that the Ly49 repertoire in Sostdc1-/- mice would correlate with NK killing ability, and observed that Sostdc1-/- NK cells are hyporesponsive against MHC-I-deficient cell targets in vitro and in vivo, despite higher CD107a surface levels and similar IFN{gamma} expression to controls. Consistent with Sostdc1s known role in the regulation of Wnt signaling, high levels of Wnt coactivators Tcf7 and Lef1 were observed in Sostdc1-/- NK cells. Expression of the NK development gene Id2 was decreased in Sostdc1-/- iNK and tNK cells, but we observed no changes in Eomes and Tbx21 expression. Reciprocal bone marrow transplant experiments showed that Sostdc1 regulates NK cell maturation and expression of Ly49 receptors in a cell-extrinsic fashion from both non-hematopoietic and hematopoietic sources. Taken together, these data support a role for Sostdc1 in the regulation of NK cell maturation, and NK cell cytotoxicity, and identify potential NK cell niches.\\n\\nSummary of ResultsO_LISostdc1-/- mice display a partial block between the tNK and mNK developmental stages.\\nC_LIO_LISostdc1 influences the Ly49 receptor repertoire on NK cells.\\nC_LIO_LINK cells in Sostdc1-/- mice display impaired ability to kill {beta}2m-/- target cells.\\nC_LIO_LISostdc1-/- NK cell subsets express high levels of Wnt coactivators Tcf7 and Lef1.\\nC_LIO_LIId2 expression is decreased in iNK and tNK cells in the absence of Sostdc1.\\nC_LIO_LIBone marrow transplantation experiments demonstrate cell-extrinsic regulation of NK cell maturation by Sostdc1 in both non-hematopoietic (stromal) and hematopoietic cells.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A number of microRNAs (miRNAs) functioning in gene silencing have been associated with cancer progression. However, common expression patterns of abnormally expressed miRNAs and their potential roles in multiple cancer types have not yet been evaluated. To minimize the difference of patients, we collected miRNA sequencing data of 575 patients with tumor and adjacent non-tumorous tissues from 14 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and performed differential expression analysis using DESeq2 and edgeR. The results showed that cancer types can be grouped based on the distribution of miRNAs with different expression patterns. We found 81 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs (SDEmiRNAs) unique to one of the 14 cancers may affect patient survival rate, and 21 key SDEmiRNAs (nine overexpressed and 12 under-expressed) associated with at least eight cancers and enriched in more than 60% of patients per cancer, including four newly identified SDEmiRNAs (hsa-mir-4746, hsa-mir-3648, hsa-mir-3687, and hsa-mir-1269a). The downstream effect of these 21 SDEmiRNAs on cellular functions was evaluated through enrichment and pathway analysis of 7,186 protein-coding gene targets from literature mining with known differential expression profiles in cancers. It enables identification of their functional similarity in cell proliferation control across a wide range of cancers and to build common regulatory networks over cancer-related pathways. This is validated by construction of a regulatory network in PI3K pathway. This study provides evidence of the value of further analysis on SDEmiRNAs as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer diagnosis and treatment.",

The mechanism for cell-to-cell transfer is not understood. Here we imaged macrophages with CellTracker Green CMFDA-labeled cytosol to ascertain whether cytosol was shared between donor and acceptor macrophages. Analysis of several transfer events detected no transfer of cytosol from donor to acceptor macrophages. However, blocking Fc and complement receptors resulted in a major diminution of cell-to-cell transfer events. The timing cell-to-cell transfer (11.17 min) closely approximated the sum of phagocytosis (4.18 min) and exocytosis (6.71 min) times. We propose that macrophage cell-to-cell transfer represents a non-lytic exocytosis event followed by phagocytosis into a macrophage that is in close proximity and name this process Dragotcytosis (Dragot is a Greek surname meaning  Sentinel) as it represents sharing of a microbe between two sentinel cells of the innate immune system.",

    "abstract": "The efficiency of neuronal information transfer in activated brain networks may affect behavioral performance. Gamma-band synchronization has been proposed to be a mechanism that facilitates neuronal processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli. In line with this, it has been shown that strong gamma-band activity in visual cortical areas leads to faster responses to a visual go cue. We investigated whether there are directly observable consequences of trial-by-trial fluctuations in non-invasively observed gamma-band activity on the neuronal response. Specifically, we hypothesizedthat the amplitude of the visual evoked response to a go cue can be predicted by gamma power in the visual system, in the window preceding the evoked response. Thirty-three human subjects (22 female) performed a visual speeded response task while their magnetoencephalogram (MEG) was recorded. The participants had to respond to a pattern reversal of a concentric moving grating. We estimated single trial stimulus-induced visual cortical gamma power, and correlated this with the estimated single trial amplitude of the most prominent event-related field (ERF) peak within the first 100 ms after the pattern reversal. In parieto-occipital cortical areas, the amplitude of the ERF correlated positively with gamma power, and correlated negatively with reaction times. No effects were observed for the alpha and beta frequency bands, despite clear stimulus onset induced modulation at those frequencies. These results support a mechanistic model, in which gamma-band synchronization enhances the neuronal gain to relevant visual input, thus leading to more efficient downstream processing and to faster responses.\\n\\nSignificance statementGamma-band activity has been associated with many cognitive functions and improved behavioral performance. For example, high amplitude gamma-band activity in visual cortical areas before a go cue leads to faster reaction times. However, it remains unclear through which neural mechanism(s) gamma-band activity eventually affects behavior. We tested whether the strength of induced gamma-band activity affects evoked activity elicited by a subsequent visual stimulus. We found enhanced amplitudes of early visual evoked activity, and faster responses with higher gamma power. This suggests that gamma-band activity affects the neuronal gain to new sensory input, and thus these results bridge the gap between gamma power and behavior, and support the putative role of gamma-band activity in the efficiency of cortical processing.",

Further-more, we estimate that 47% of symptomatic dual infections contain sibling strains likely to have been co-transmitted from a single mosquito, and find evidence of mixed infections propagated over successive infection cycles. Finally, leveraging data from the Malaria Atlas Project, we find that prevalence correlates within Africa, but not Asia, with both the rate of mixed infection and the level of IBD.",

Here, crossing a 10-year longitudinal dataset of over 700,000 community-acquired UTIs with over 6,000,000 personally-linked records of antibiotic purchases, we show that the resistance profile of infections can be predicted based on patient-specific demographics and clinical history. Age, gender, and retirement home residence had strong, yet differential and even non-monotonic, associations with resistance to different antibiotics. Resistance profiles were also associated with the patients records of past urine samples and antibiotic usage, with these associations persisting for months and even longer than a year. Drug usage selected specifically for its own cognate resistance, which led indirectly, through genetic linkage, also to resistance to other, even mechanistically unrelated, drugs. Applying machine learning models, these association patterns allowed good personalized predictions of resistance, which could inform and better optimize empirical prescription of antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Research on the relationship between cannabis use and safe driving has produced mixed results. Most studies have focused exclusively on the presence or concentration of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive ingredient in the drug. However, cannabis is a complex substance, and both toxicological research and user experience suggests that some cannabis strains--often those with at least moderate levels of cannabidiol (CBD)-- produce a different, more sedating \\\"high\\\" than cannabis strains with no or low levels of CBD. We hypothesize that the sedating properties of some high-CBD cannabis strains has potential to impair driving and driving-related skills above and beyond the effects of THC intoxication. Three studies--one instrumented vehicle driving study and two laboratory-style epidemiological studies--examined real driving and computerized task performance as a function THC and CBD concentrations (and their interactions). In all three studies, higher CBD levels predicted greater impairment. There was relatively little evidence of impairment when CBD was zero, even at high THC levels. The results suggest that THC concentrations alone are not sufficient to predict impairment due to cannabis use. Results are interpreted in the context of drug tolerance.",

We then fit a compartmental transmission model to the adjusted incidence stratified by age-group and location. Model forecasts with a lead-time of two weeks were issued on 12th, 20th, 26th and 30th December and communicated to decision-makers.\\n\\nResultsThe first forecast estimated that the outbreak would peak on 16th December in Balukhali camp with 222 (95% prediction interval 126-409) cases and would continue to grow in Kutupalong camp, requiring a bed capacity of 200 (95% PI 142-301). On 16th December, a total of 70 cases were reported, lower than forecasted. Subsequent forecasts were more accurate: on 20th December we predicted a total of 701 cases (95% PI 477-901) and 105 (95% PI 72-135) hospitalizations until the end of the year, with 616 cases actually reported during this period.\\n\\nConclusionsReal-time modelling enabled feedback of key information about the potential scale of the epidemic, resource needs, and mechanisms of transmission to decision-makers at a time when this information was largely unknown. By December 20th, the model generated reliable forecasts and helped support decision-making on operational aspects of the outbreak response, such as hospital bed and staff needs, and with advocacy for control measures. Although modelling is only one component of the evidence base for decision-making in outbreak situations, suitable analysis and forecasting techniques can be used to gain insights into an ongoing outbreak.",

    "abstract": "Cophylogeny is the congruence of phylogenetic relationships between two different groups of organisms due to their long-term interaction, such as between host and pathogen species. Discordance between host and pathogen phylogenies may occur due to pathogen host-switch events, pathogen speciation within a host species, and extinction. Here, we investigated the use of tree shape distance measures to quantify the degree of cophylogeny for the comparative analysis of host-pathogen interactions across taxonomic groups.\\n\\nWe firstly implemented a coalescent model to simulate pathogen phylogenies within a fixed host tree, given the cospeciation probability, migration rate between hosts, and pathogen speciation rate within hosts.\\n\\nNext, we used simulations from this model to evaluate 13 distance metrics between these trees and the host tree, including Robinson-Foulds distance and two kernel distances that we developed for labeled and unlabeled trees, which use branch lengths and can accommodate trees of different sizes. Finally, we used these distance metrics to revisit actual datasets from published cophylogenetic studies across all taxonomic groups, where authors described the observed associations as representing a high or low degree of cophylogeny.\\n\\nOur simulation analyses demonstrated that some metrics are more informative than others with respect to specific coevolution parameters. For example, the Sim metric was the most responsive to variation in coalescence rates, whereas the unlabeled kernel metric was the most responsive to cospeciation probabilities. We also determined that distance metrics were more informative about the model parameters when the underlying parameter values did not assume extreme values, e.g., rapid host switching. When applied to real datasets, projection of these trees associations into a parameter space defined by the 13 distance metrics revealed some clustering of studies reporting low concordance. This suggested that different investigators are describing concordance in a consistent way across biological systems, and that these expert subjective assessments can be at least partly quantified using distance metrics.\\n\\nOur results support the hypothesis that tree distance measures can be useful for quantifying host and pathogen cophylogeny. This motivates the usage of distance metrics in the field of coevolution and supports the development of simulation-based methods, i.e., approximate Bayesian computation, to estimate coevolutionary parameters from the discordant shapes of host and pathogen trees.

    "abstract": "Many bacteria have complex cell shapes, but the mechanisms producing their distinctive morphologies are still poorly understood. Caulobacter crescentus, for instance, exhibits a stalk-like extension that carries an adhesive holdfast mediating surface attachment. This structure forms through zonal peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the old cell pole and elongates extensively under phosphate-limiting conditions. We analyzed the composition of cell body and stalk peptidoglycan and identified significant differences in the nature and proportion of peptide crosslinks, indicating that the stalk represents a distinct subcellular domain with specific mechanical properties. To identify factors that participate in stalk formation, we systematically inactivated and localized predicted components of the cell wall biosynthetic machinery of C. crescentus. Our results show that the biosynthesis of stalk peptidoglycan involves a dedicated peptidoglycan biosynthetic complex that combines specific components of the divisome and elongasome, suggesting that the repurposing of pre-existing machinery provides a straightforward means to evolve new morphological traits.",

Using records from the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital (CHBH) in Soweto, South Africa, we determined mortality from medical conditions associated with HIV.\\n\\nMethodsFrom January 2006 to December 2009 AB collected data on 15,725 deaths including age, sex, day of admittance and death, HIV status, ART initiation and CD4+ cell counts and reviewed the underlying cause of death using medical notes. Conditions known to be associated with HIV were cases; conditions not associated with HIV were controls. We calculate the HIV odds-ratios for cases relative to controls and HIV-attributable deaths as the fraction of those with each condition, the disease-attributable fraction (DA), and as the fraction of all deaths, the population-attributable fraction (PAF).\\n\\nInterpretationThe high prevalence of HIV among those that died in the medical wards at the CHBH, especially in those below the age of 50 years, demonstrates the impact of the HIV-epidemic on adult mortality and hospital services and the extent to which early antiretroviral treatment would have reduced the burden of both. Of the deaths included in the analysis the prevalence of HIV was 61% and the prevalence of AIDS related conditions was 69%. The HIV-attributable fraction was 36% in the whole sample and 60% in those that were HIV-positive. Cryptococcosis, Kaposis sarcoma and Pneumocystis jeroveci are highly predictive of HIV while TB, gastroenteritis and anaemia are very strongly associated with HIV. The greatest number of deaths attributable to HIV was among those dying of TB or of other respiratory conditions.\\n\\nFundingNo funding was received for this study.",

Here we examine the effect of PA on the pathogenicity of the Crohns disease-associated microbe, adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC). Passage of AIEC through a murine model, where the low intestinal PA levels were increased to replicate those of the human intestine, led to the recovery of AIEC post-infection that had significantly increased virulence. These phenotypic changes, including increased adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells and biofilm formation, could be replicated in AIEC in vitro through exposure to PA alone. This in vitro exposure of AIEC to PA fundamentally changed AIEC virulence, with strains exposed to PA in vitro subsequently persisting at 20-fold higher levels in a murine model compared to non-exposed strains. RNA-sequencing identified the transcriptional changes in AIEC in response to PA with upregulation of genes involved in biofilm formation, stress responses, metabolism, membrane integrity and alternative carbon source utilisation. These PA induced changes in virulence could be replicated in a number of E. coli isolates from Crohns disease patients. Finally, removal of the PA selective pressure was sufficient to reverse these phenotypic changes. Our data indicate that exposure of AIEC to PA evolves bacteria that are both resistant to this natural human intestinal antimicrobial and increasingly virulent in its presence.\\n\\nImportanceExposure to propionic acid, an intestinal short chain fatty acid and commonly used antimicrobial in Western food production, induces significant virulence associated phenotypic changes in adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC).",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system has successfully been adapted to edit the genome of various organisms. However, our ability to predict editing accuracy, efficacy and outcome at specific sites is limited by an incomplete understanding of how the bacterial system interacts with eukaryotic genomes and DNA repair machineries. Here, we performed the largest comparison of indel profiles to date, examining over one thousand sites in the genome of human cells, and uncovered general principles guiding CRISPR-mediated DNA editing. We find that precision of DNA editing varies considerably among sites, with some targets showing one highly-preferred indel and others displaying a wide range of infrequent indels. Editing precision correlates with editing efficiency, homology-associated end-joining for both insertions and deletions, and a preference for single-nucleotide insertions. Precise targets and the identity of their preferred indel can be predicted based on simple rules that mainly depend on the fourth nucleotide upstream of the PAM sequence. Regardless of precision, site-specific indel profiles are highly robust and depend on both DNA sequence and chromatin features. Our findings have important implications for clinical applications of CRISPR technology and reveal general patterns of broken end-joining that can inform us on DNA repair mechanisms in human cells.",

    "abstract": "Persistent activity, the elevated firing of a neuron after the termination of a stimulus, is hypothesized to play a critical role in working memory. This form of activity is therefore typically studied within the context of a behavioural task that includes a working memory component. Here we investigated whether persistent activity is observed in sensory cortex and thalamus in the absence of any explicit behavioural task. We recorded spiking activity from single units in the auditory cortex (fields A1, R and RT) and thalamus of awake, passively-listening marmosets. We observed persistent activity that lasted for hundreds of milliseconds following the termination of the acoustic stimulus, in the absence of a task. Persistent activity was observed following both adapting and sustained responses during the stimulus and showed similar stimulus tuning to these evoked responses. Persistent activity was also observed following suppression in firing during the stimulus. These response types were observed across all cortical fields tested, but were largely absent from thalamus. As well as being of shorter duration, thalamic persistent activity emerged following a longer latency than in cortex, indicating that persistent activity may be generated within auditory cortex during passive listening. Given that these responses were observed in the absence of a explicit behavioural task, persistent activity in sensory cortex may have functional importance beyond storing task-relevant information in working memory.",

By interrogating the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal compound sensitivity dataset, we show that cells of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) possess a lineage-specific vulnerability to ferroptosis that can be exploited by inhibiting glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Using genome-wide CRISPR screening and lipidomic profiling, we reveal that this vulnerability is driven by the HIF-2-HILPDA pathway by inducing a polyunsaturated fatty acyl (PUFA)-lipid-enriched cell state that is dependent on GPX4 for survival and susceptible to ferroptosis. This cell state is developmentally primed by the HNF-1{beta}-1-Acylglycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase 3 (AGPAT3) axis in the renal lineage. In addition to PUFA metabolism, ferroptosis is facilitated by a phospholipid flippase TMEM30A involved in membrane topology.

    "abstract": "Spindle checkpoint strength is dictated by three criteria: the number of unattached kinetochores, cell volume and cell fate. We show that the conserved AAA-ATPase, PCH-2/TRIP13, which remodels the checkpoint effector Mad2 from an active conformation to an inactive one, controls checkpoint strength in C. elegans. When we manipulate embryos to decrease cell volume, PCH-2 is no longer required for the spindle checkpoint or recruitment of Mad2 at unattached kinetochores. This role in checkpoint strength is not limited to large cells: the stronger checkpoint in germline precursor cells also depends on PCH-2. PCH-2 is enriched in germline precursor cells and this enrichment relies on conserved factors that induce asymmetry in the early embryo. Finally, the stronger checkpoint in germline precursor cells is regulated by CMT-1, the ortholog of p31comet, which is required for both PCH-2s localization to unattached kinetochores and its enrichment in germline precursor cells. Thus, PCH-2, likely by regulating the availability of inactive Mad2 at and near unattached kinetochores, governs checkpoint strength. This role may be specifically relevant in scenarios where maintaining genomic stability is particularly challenging, such as in oocytes and early embryos enlarged for developmental competence and germline cells that maintain immortality.",

As these Tetrasphaera cells did not exhibit the classical phenotype of poly-P accumulating microbes, our entire understanding of the microbiology of the EBPR process has to be revised.

First, a multivariate random effects tobit model was used to obtain the posterior distribution of pathogen concentrations, and their interdependencies, in soil and surface water, based upon empirical data of enteric pathogen contamination in three neighborhoods of Kisumu. Then, exposure doses were estimated using behavioral contact parameters from previous studies, and contrasted under different exposure conditions.\\n\\nResultsMulti-pathogen exposure of children at public play areas was common. Pathogen doses and the probability of multi-pathogen ingestion increased with: higher frequency of environmental contact, especially for surface water; larger volume of soil or water ingested; and with play at multiple sites in the neighborhood versus single site play.\\n\\nDiscussionChild contact with surface water and soil at public play areas in their neighborhood is an important cause of exposure to enteric pathogens in Kisumu, and behavioral, environmental, and spatial conditions are determinants of exposure.",

Interactions between motor neurons and glia contribute to motor neuron loss, but the spatiotemporal ordering of molecular events that drive these processes in intact spinal tissue remains poorly understood. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to obtain gene expression measurements of mouse spinal cords over the course of disease, as well as of postmortem tissue from ALS patients, to characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms in ALS. We identify novel pathway dynamics, regional differences between microglia and astrocyte populations at early time-points, and discern perturbations in several transcriptional pathways shared between murine models of ALS and human postmortem spinal cords.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryAnalysis of the ALS spinal cord using Spatial Transcriptomics reveals spatiotemporal dynamics of disease driven gene regulation.",

We previously discovered an FMN derivative --5FDQD-- that protects mice against diarrhea-causing Clostridium difficile bacteria. Here, we present the structure-based drug design strategy that led to the discovery of this fluoro-phenyl derivative with antibacterial properties. This approach involved the following stages: (1) structural analysis of all available free and bound FMN riboswitch structures; (2) design, synthesis and purification of derivatives; (3) in vitro testing for productive binding using two chemical probing methods; (4) in vitro transcription termination assays; (5) resolution of the crystal structures of the FMN riboswitch in complex with the most mature candidates. In the process, we delineated principles for productive binding to this riboswitch, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of a coordinated structure-guided approach to designing drugs against RNA.\\n\\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=146 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/389148_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (41K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f59798org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b38b02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6b50faorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1915fc4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Exploring the chemical structure landscape of FMN riboswitch binders.\\n\\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "MotivationDe Bruijn graph, a fundamental data structure to represent and organize genome sequence, plays important roles in various kinds of sequence analysis tasks such as de novo assembly, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) read alignment, pan-genome analysis, metagenomics analysis, HTS read correction, etc. With the rapid development of HTS data and ever-increasing number of assembled genomes, there is a high demand to construct de Bruijn graph for sequences up to Tera-base-pair level. It is non-trivial since the size of the graph to be constructed could be very large and each graph consists of hundreds of billions of vertices and edges. Current existing approaches may have unaffordable memory footprints to handle such a large de Bruijn graph. Moreover, it also requires the construction approach to handle very large dataset efficiently, even if in a relatively small RAM space.\\n\\nResultsWe propose a lightweight parallel de Bruijn graph construction approach, de Bruijn Graph Constructor in Scalable Memory (deGSM). The main idea of deGSM is to efficiently construct the Bur-rows-Wheeler Transformation (BWT) of the unipaths of de Bruijn graph in constant RAM space and transform the BWT into the original unitigs. It is mainly implemented by a fast parallel external sorting of k-mers, which allows only a part of k-mers kept in RAM by a novel organization of the k-mers. The experimental results demonstrate that, just with a commonly used machine, deGSM is able to handle very large genome sequence(s), e.g., the contigs (305 Gbp) and scaffolds (1.1 Tbp) recorded in Gen-Bank database and Picea abies HTS dataset (9.7 Tbp). Moreover, deGSM also has faster or comparable construction speed compared with state-of-the-art approaches. With its high scalability and efficiency, deGSM has enormous potentials in many large scale genomics studies.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/hitbc/deGSM.\\n\\nContactydwang@hit.edu.cn (YW) and bo.liu@hit.edu.cn (BL)\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available online.",

    "abstract": "A central goal of population genetics is to understand how genetic drift, natural selection, and gene flow shape allele frequencies through time. However, the actual processes underlying these changes - variation in individual survival, reproductive success, and movement - are often difficult to quantify. Fully understanding these processes requires the population pedigree, the set of relationships among all individuals in the population through time. Here, we use extensive pedigree and genomic information from a long-studied natural population of Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) to directly characterize the relative roles of different evolutionary processes in shaping patterns of genetic variation through time. We performed gene dropping simulations to estimate individual genetic contributions to the population and model drift on the known pedigree. We found that observed allele frequency changes are generally well predicted by accounting for the different genetic contributions of founders. Our results show that the genetic contribution of recent immigrants is substantial, with some large allele frequency shifts that otherwise may have been attributed to selection actually due to gene flow. We identified a few SNPs under directional short-term selection after appropriately accounting for gene flow. Using models that account for changes in population size, we partitioned the proportion of variance in allele frequency change through time. Observed allele frequency changes are primarily due to variation in survival and reproductive success, with gene flow making a smaller contribution. This study provides one of the most complete descriptions of short-term evolutionary change in allele frequencies in a natural population to date.",

    "abstract": "Although interspecific competition has long been recognized as a major driver of trait divergence and adaptive evolution1-3, relatively little effort has focused on how it influences the evolution of intraspecific cooperation4-6. Here we identify the mechanism by which the perceived pressure of interspecific competition influences the transition from intraspecific conflict to cooperation in a facultative cooperatively breeding species, the Asian burying beetle Nicrophorus nepalensis. In their natural environment in central Taiwan, N. nepalensis are typically aggressive to conspecifics and only cooperate with others of their own species at critical carcass resources in the presence of blowflies, their primary competitors7. We demonstrate that beetles form larger groups and are more cooperative in carcass preparation in warmer environments where the pressure of interspecific competition with blowflies is highest8. To test the hypothesis that the presence of blowflies promotes beetle cooperation and to identify the mechanism by which this occurs, we manipulated blowfly larvae on carcasses in the lab. We not only found that beetles are more cooperative at carcasses when blowfly maggots have begun to digest the tissue, but that this social cooperation appears to be triggered by a single chemical cue-- dimethyl disulfide (DMDS)--emitted from carcasses consumed by blowflies but not from control carcasses lacking blowflies. Our results provide experimental evidence that interspecific competition promotes the transition from intraspecific conflict to cooperation in N. nepalensis via a surprisingly simple social chemical cue that is a reliable indicator of interspecific competition. This finding helps bridge the gap between the proximate and ultimate factors regulating the transition between cooperation and conflict and moves toward a more comprehensive understanding of the evolution of mechanisms governing intraspecific variation in social behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Chardonnay is the basis of some of the worlds most iconic wines and its success is underpinned by a historic program of clonal selection. There are numerous clones of Chardonnay available that exhibit differences in key viticultural and oenological traits that have arisen from the accumulation of somatic mutations during centuries of asexual propagation. However, the genetic variation that underlies these differences remains largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, a high-quality, diploid-phased Chardonnay genome assembly was produced from single-molecule real time sequencing, and combined with re-sequencing data from 15 different commercial Chardonnay clones. There were 1620 markers identified that distinguish the 15 Chardonnay clones. These markers were reliably used for clonal identification of validation genomic material, as well as in identifying a potential genetic basis for some clonal phenotypic differences. The predicted parentage of the Chardonnay haplomes was elucidated by mapping sequence data from the predicted parents of Chardonnay (Gouais blanc and Pinot noir) against the Chardonnay reference genome. This enabled the detection of instances of heterosis, with differentially-expanded gene families being inherited from the parents of Chardonnay. Most surprisingly however, the patterns of nucleotide variation present in the Chardonnay genome indicate that Pinot noir and Gouais blanc share an extremely high degree of kinship that has resulted in the Chardonnay genome displaying characteristics that are indicative of inbreeding.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPhenotypic variation within a grapevine cultivar arises from an accumulation of mutations from serial vegetative propagation. Old cultivars such as Chardonnay have been propagated for centuries resulting in hundreds of available  clones containing unique genetic mutations and a range of various phenotypic peculiarities. The genetic mutations can be leveraged as genetic markers and are useful in identifying specific clones for authenticity testing, or as breeding markers for new clonal selections where particular mutations are known to confer a phenotypic trait. We produced a high-quality genome assembly for Chardonnay, and using re-sequencing data for 15 popular clones, were able to identify a large selection of markers that are unique to at least one clone. We identified mutations that may confer phenotypic effects, and were able to identify clones from material independently sourced from nurseries and vineyards. The marker detection framework we describe for authenticity testing would be applicable to other grapevine cultivars or even other agriculturally important woody-plant crops that are vegetatively propagated such as fruit orchards. Finally, we show that the Chardonnay genome contains extensive evidence for parental inbreeding, such that its parents, Gouais blanc and Pinot noir, may even represent first-degree relatives.",

    "abstract": "PurposeQuantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) provides a method for the non-invasive study of brain structure and associated changes, expressed in physical units. qMRI parameters have been shown to reflect brain tissue composition such as myelin. Nevertheless, it remains a major challenge to identify and quantify the contributions of specific molecular components to the MRI signal. Here, we describe a phantom system that can be used to evaluate the contribution of human brain lipids to qMRI parameters.\\n\\nMethodsA thin layer evaporation-hydration technique was used to formulate liposomes that mimic the physiological bi-layered membrane lipid environment. We then applied quantitative clinical MRI techniques with adjusted bias corrections in order to test the ability of the phantom system to estimate multiple qMRI parameters such as proton density (PD), T1, T2, T2* and magnetization transfer (MT).\\n\\nResultsThe results indicated that phantoms composed of various lipids could provide a stable and reliable estimation of qMRI parameters. In addition, the calculated water fraction (WF) maps for the phantoms were found to accurately represent the true WF volumes.\\n\\nConclusionWe have successfully created a biologically relevant liposome phantom system whose lipid composition can be fully controlled. This system can be used to measure the contributions of lipids to qMRI parameters under conditions that are relevant to in-vivo human scans.",
