    "abstract": "Cycads are the only early seed plants that have evolved a specialized root to host endophytic bacteria that fix nitrogen. To provide evolutionary and functional insights into this million-year old symbiosis, we investigate endophytic bacterial sub-communities isolated from coralloid roots of species from Dioon (Zamiaceae) sampled from their natural habitats. We employed a sub-community co-culture experimental strategy to reveal both predominant and rare bacteria, which were characterized using phylogenomics and detailed metabolic annotation. Diazotrophic plant endophytes, including Bradyrhizobium, Burkholderia, Mesorhizobium, Nostoc, and Rhizobium species, dominated the epiphyte-free sub-communities. Draft genomes of six cyanobacteria species were obtained after shotgun metagenomics of selected sub-communities and used for whole-genome inferences that suggest two Dioon-specific monophyletic groups and a level of specialization characteristic of co-evolved symbiotic relationships. In agreement with this, the genomes of these cyanobacteria were found to encode unique biosynthetic gene clusters, predicted to direct the synthesis of specialized metabolites, mainly involving peptides. After combining genome mining with metabolite profiling using multiphoton excitation fluorescence microscopy, we also show that Caulobacter species co-exist with cyanobacteria, and may interact with them by means of a novel indigoidine-like specialized metabolite. We provide an unprecedented view of the composition of the cycad coralloid root, including phylogenetic and functional patterns mediated by specialized metabolites that may be important for the evolution of ancient symbiotic adaptations.",

    "abstract": "Extraembryonic tissues contribute to animal development, which often entails spreading over embryo or yolk. Apart from changes in cell shape, the requirements for this tissue spreading are not well understood. Here we analyze spreading of the extraembryonic serosa in the scuttle fly Megaselia abdita. The serosa forms from a columnar blastoderm anlage, becomes a squamous epithelium, and eventually spreads over the embryo proper. We describe the dynamics of this process in long-term, whole-embryo time-lapse recordings, demonstrating that free serosa spreading is preceded by a prolonged pause in tissue expansion. Closer examination of this pause reveals mechanical coupling to the underlying yolk sac, which is later released. We find mechanical coupling prolonged and serosa spreading impaired after knockdown of M. abdita Matrix metalloprotease 1. We conclude that tissue-tissue interactions provide a critical functional element to constrain spreading epithelia.\\n\\nImpact StatementExtraembryonic tissue spreading in the scuttle fly Megaselia abdita requires mechanical decoupling from the underlying yolk sac.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWith the explosion of high-throughput data available in biology, the bottleneck is shifted to effective data interpretation. By taking advantage of the available data, it is possible to identify the biomarkers and signatures to distinguish subtypes of a specific cancer in the context of clinical trials. This requires sophisticated methods to retrieve the information out of the data, and various algorithms have been recently devised.\\n\\nResultsHere, we applied the prize-collecting Steiner tree (PCST) approach to obtain a gene expression signature for the classification of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The PCST is a network-based approach to capture new insights about genomic data by incorporating an interaction network landscape. Moreover, we adopted the ElasticNet incorporating PCA as a classification method. We used seven public gene expression profiling datasets (three for training, and four for testing) available in the literature, and obtained 10 genes as signature. We tested these genes by employing ElasticNet, and compared the performance with the DAC algorithm as current golden standard. The performance of the PCST signature with ElasticNet outperformed the DAC in distinguishing the subtypes. In addition, the gene expression signature was able to accurately stratify DLBCL patients on survival data.\\n\\nConclusionsWe developed a network-based optimization technique that performs unbiased signature selection by integrating genomic data with biological networks. Our classifier trained with the obtained signature outperformed the state-of-the-art method in subtype distinction and survival data stratification in DLBCL. The proposed method is a general approach that can be applied on other classification problems.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of antibody repertoires by high-throughput sequencing is of major importance in understanding adaptive immune responses. Our knowledge of variations in the genomic loci encoding antibody genes is incomplete, mostly due to technical difficulties in aligning short reads to these highly repetitive loci. The partial knowledge results in conflicting V-D-J gene assignments between different algorithms, and biased genotype and haplotype inference. Previous studies have shown that haplotypes can be inferred by taking advantage of IGHJ6 heterozygosity, observed in approximately one third of the population. Here, we propose a robust novel method for determining V-D-J haplotypes by adapting a Bayesian framework. Our method extends haplotype inference to IGHD- and IGHV-based analysis, thereby enabling inference of complex genetic events like deletions and copy number variations in the entire population. We generated the largest multi individual data set, to date, of naive B-cell repertoires, and tested our method on it. We present evidence for allele usage bias, as well as a mosaic, tiled pattern of deleted and present IGHD and IGHV nearby genes, across the population. The inferred haplotypes and deletion patterns may have clinical implications for genetic predispositions to diseases. Our findings greatly expand the knowledge that can be extracted from antibody repertoire sequencing data.",

The detected virus sequence is 7,607 nt long, including a typical genome organization of ORFs encoding a replicase (RP), a 22 kDa protein, a movement protein, a coat protein (CP) and a nucleic acid binding protein. Here, we present the characterization of a novel virus from grapevines. Phylogenetic analyses based on the predicted RP and CP protein unequivocally places the new virus within the Vitivirus genus. Multiple independent RNAseq data confirmed the presence of the detected virus in berries at diverse developmental stages. Additionally, we detected, confirmed, and assembled virus sequences from grapevine samples of distinct cultivars from America, Europe, Asia and Oceania, sharing 74.9%-97.9% nt identity, suggesting that the identified virus is widely distributed and diverse.

RNAi inheritance is associated with Histone-3-Lysine-9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) of the targeted genes. In other organisms, maintenance of silencing requires a feed-forward loop between H3K9me3 and small RNAs. Here we show that in C. elegans not only is H3K9me3 unnecessary for inheritance, the modifications function depends on the identity of the RNAi-targeted gene. We found an asymmetry in the requirement for H3K9me3 and the main worm H3K9me3 methyltransferases, SET-25 and SET-32. Both methyltransferases promote heritable silencing of the foreign gene gfp, but are dispensable for silencing of the endogenous gene oma-1. Genome-wide examination of heritable endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) revealed that the SET-25-dependent heritable endo-siRNAs target newly acquired and highly H3K9me3 marked genes. Thus, \\\"repressive\\\" chromatin marks could be important specifically for heritable silencing of genes which are flagged as \\\"foreign\\\", such as gfp.",

    "abstract": "In rodents, the progression of extrastriate areas located laterally to primary visual cortex (V1) has been assigned to a putative object-processing pathway (homologous to the primate ventral stream), based on anatomical considerations. Recently, we found functional support for such attribution (Tafazoli et al., 2017), by showing that this cortical progression is specialized for coding object identity despite view changes - the hallmark property of a ventral-like pathway. Here, we sought to clarify what computations are at the base of such specialization. To this aim, we performed multi-electrode recordings from V1 and laterolateral area LL (at the apex of the putative ventral-like hierarchy) of male adult rats, during the presentation of drifting gratings and noise movies. We found that the extent to which neuronal responses were entrained to the phase of the gratings sharply dropped from V1 to LL, along with the quality of the receptive fields inferred through reverse correlation. Concomitantly, the tendency of neurons to respond to different oriented gratings increased, while the sharpness of orientation tuning declined. Critically, these trends are consistent with the nonlinear summation of visual inputs that is expected to take place along the ventral stream, according to the predictions of hierarchical models of ventral computations and a meta-analysis of the monkey literature. This suggests an intriguing homology between the mechanisms responsible for building up shape selectivity and transformation tolerance in the visual cortex of primates and rodents, reasserting the potential of the latter as models to investigate ventral stream functions at the circuitry level.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDespite the growing popularity of rodents as models of visual functions, it remains unclear whether their visual cortex contains specialized modules for processing shape information. To addresses this question, we compared how neuronal tuning evolves from rat primary visual cortex (V1) to a downstream visual cortical region (area LL) that previous work has implicated in shape processing. In our experiments, LL neurons displayed a stronger tendency to respond to drifting gratings with different orientations, while maintaining a sustained response across the whole duration of the drift cycle. These trends match the increased complexity of pattern selectivity and the augmented tolerance to stimulus translation found in monkey visual temporal cortex, thus revealing a homology between shape processing in rodents and primates.",

    "abstract": "Neuromodulation plays a critical role in brain function in both health and disease. New optical tools, and their validation in biological tissues, are needed that can image neuromodulation with high spatial and temporal resolution, which will add an important new dimension of information to neuroscience research. Here, we demonstrate the use of a catecholamine nanosensor with fluorescent emission in the 1000-1300 nm near-infrared window to measure dopamine transmission in ex vivo brain slices. These near-infrared catecholamine nanosensors (nIRCats) represent a broader class of nanosensors that can be synthesized from non-covalent conjugation of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) with single strand oligonucleotides. We show that nIRCats can be used to detect catecholamine efflux in brain tissue driven by both electrical stimulation or optogenetic stimulation. Spatial analysis of electrically-evoked signals revealed dynamic regions of interest approximately 2 microns in size in which transients scaled with simulation intensity. Optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic terminals produced similar transients, whereas optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic terminals showed no effect on nIRCat signal. Bath application of nomifensine prolonged nIRCat fluorescence signal, consistent with reuptake blockade of dopamine. We further show that the chemically synthetic molecular recognition elements of nIRCats permit measurement of dopamine dynamics in the presence of dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists. These nIRCat nanosensors may be advantageous for future use because i) they do not require virus delivery, gene delivery, or protein expression, ii) their near-infrared fluorescence facilitates imaging in optically scattering brain tissue and is compatible for use in conjunction with other optical neuroscience tool sets, iii) the broad availability of unique near-infrared colors have the potential for simultaneous detection of multiple neurochemical signals, and iv) they are compatible with pharmacology. Together, these data suggest nIRCats and other nanosensors of this class can serve as versatile new optical tools to report dynamics of extracellular neuromodulation in the brain.",

Selection experiments, which reproduce rapid evolution under controlled conditions, are excellent tools to study how genomes evolve under strong selection. Here we present a genomic dissection of the Longshanks selection experiment, in which mice were selectively bred over 20 generations for longer tibiae relative to body mass, resulting in 13% longer tibiae in two replicate lines. We synthesized evolutionary theory, genome sequences and molecular genetics to understand the selection response and found that it involved both polygenic adaptation and discrete loci of major effect, with the strongest loci likely to be selected in parallel between replicates.

    "abstract": "A major open question concerns how the brain governs the allocation of control between two distinct strategies for learning from reinforcement: model-based and model-free reinforcement learning. While there is evidence to suggest that the reliability of the predictions of the two systems is a key variable responsible for the arbitration process, another key variable has remained relatively unexplored: the role of task complexity. By using a combination of novel task design, computational modeling, and model-based fMRI analysis, we examined the role of task complexity alongside state-space uncertainty in the arbitration process between model-based and model-free RL. We found evidence to suggest that task complexity plays a role in influencing the arbitration process alongside state-space uncertainty. Participants tended to increase model-based RL control in response to increasing task complexity. However, they resorted to model-free RL when both uncertainty and task complexity were high, suggesting that these two variables interact during the arbitration process. Computational fMRI revealed that task complexity interacts with neural representations of the reliability of the two systems in the inferior prefrontal cortex bilaterally. These findings provide insight into how the inferior prefrontal cortex negotiates the trade-off between model-based and model-free RL in the presence of uncertainty and complexity, and more generally, illustrates how the brain resolves uncertainty and complexity in dynamically changing environments.\\n\\nSUMMARY OF FINDINGS- Elucidated the role of state-space uncertainty and complexity in model-based and model-free RL.\\n\\n- Found behavioral and neural evidence for complexity-sensitive prefrontal arbitration.\\n\\n- High task complexity induces explorative model-based RL.",

    "abstract": "CTPsyn is a crucial metabolic enzyme which synthesizes CTP molecules through the de novo or salvage pathway. It has the extraordinary ability to compartmentalize into filaments termed cytoophidia. Although this property is retained amongst orthologues, and cytoophidia are therefore found across kingdoms, the mechanisms behind their formation remain unknown. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded RNA with length of 20 - 22 nucleotides, capable of exerting mRNA silencing and degradation as a form of regulation. D. melanogaster itself has a high total gene count to miRNA gene number ratio, alluding to the possibility that CTPsyn may too come under the regulatory effects of these small RNAs. A thorough miRNA overexpression involving 123 UAS-miRNA lines, followed by staining of ovarian cytoophidia dme-egg chambers, revealed a small group of candidates which confer either a lengthening or truncating effect on the structure. Prime candidates are identified on the basis of consistency. MiR-975 and miR-1014 are both cytoophidia-elongating, whereas miR-190 and miR-932 are cytoophidia-shortening. Though target prediction shows that miR-975 and miR-932 do indeed have binding sites on CTPsyn mRNA, in vitro assays instead revealed that none of the four candidates may actually do so. This suggests that the effects asserted by overexpressed miRNAs indirectly reach CTPsyn and its cytoophidia through the actions of middling elements. In silico target prediction and qPCR quantification indicated that, at least for miR-932 and miR-1014, these undetermined elements may be players in fat metabolism. This is the first study to thoroughly investigate miRNAs in connection to CTPsyn expression and activity in any species. The findings presented could serve as a basis for further queries into not only the fundamental aspects of the enzymes regulation, but may uncover new facets of closely related pathways as well.",

    "abstract": "The development of mechanically functional cartilage and bone tissue constructs of clinically relevant size, as well as their integration with native tissues, remain important challenges for regenerative medicine. The objective of this study was to assess adult human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in large, three dimensionally woven poly({varepsilon}-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds in proximity to viable bone, both in a nude rat subcutaneous pouch model and under simulated conditions in vitro. In Study I, various scaffold permutations: PCL alone, PCL-bone, \\\"point-of- care\\\" seeded MSC-PCL-bone, and chondrogenically pre-cultured Ch-MSC-PCL-bone constructs were implanted in a dorsal, ectopic pouch in a nude rat. After eight weeks, only cells in the Ch- MSC-PCL constructs exhibited both chondrogenic and osteogenic gene expression profiles. Notably, while both tissue profiles were present, constructs that had been chondrogenically pre- cultured prior to implantation showed a loss of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) as well as the presence of mineralization along with the formation of trabecula-like structures. In Study II of the study, the GAG loss and mineralization observed in Study I in vivo were recapitulated in vitro by the presence of either nearby bone or osteogenic culture medium additives but were prevented by a continued presence of chondrogenic medium additives. These data suggest conditions under which adult human stem cells in combination with polymer scaffolds synthesize functional and phenotypically distinct tissues based on the environmental conditions, and highlight the potential influence that paracrine factors from adjacent bone may have on MSC fate, once implanted in vivo for chondral or osteochondral repair.",

    "abstract": "Compact myelin forms the basis of nerve insulation essential for higher vertebrates. Dozens of myelin membrane bilayers undergo tight stacking, and in the peripheral nervous system, this is partially enabled by myelin protein zero (P0). Consisting of an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like extracellular domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic extension (P0ct), P0 harbours an important task in ensuring the integrity of compact myelin in the extracellular compartment, referred to as the intraperiod line. Several disease mutations resulting in peripheral neuropathies have been identified for P0, reflecting its physiological importance, but the arrangement of P0 within the myelin ultrastructure remains obscure. We performed a biophysical characterization of recombinant P0ct. P0ct contributes to the binding affinity between apposed cytoplasmic myelin membrane leaflets, which not only results in fluidity changes of the bilayers themselves, but also potentially involves the rearrangement of the Ig-like domains in a manner that stabilizes the intraperiod line. Transmission electron cryomicroscopy of native full-length P0 showed that P0 stacks lipid membranes by forming antiparallel dimers between the extracellular Ig-like domains. The zipper-like arrangement of the P0 extracellular domains between two membranes explains the double structure of the myelin intraperiod line. Our results contribute to the understanding of PNS myelin, the role of P0 therein, and the underlying molecular foundation of compact myelin stability in health and disease.",

Here we directly compared the phagosomal pH of human neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cell (DC) and monocyte-derived cells. An unexpected observation was the striking difference in phagosomal environment between the three monocytes subsets. Classical monocytes and neutrophils had alkaline phagosomes, yet non-classical monocytes had more acid phagosomes. Intermediate monocytes had an intermediate phenotype. We next investigated the differences between primary DCs versus in vitro monocyte-derived DCs and established that both these cells had acidic phagosomal environments.

However, little is known about the principles of spatial organization of E and I synapses across the entire dendritic tree of mammalian neurons. We developed a new, open-source, reconstruction platform for mapping the size and spatial distribution of E and I synapses received by individual, genetically-labeled, layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons (PNs) in vivo. We mapped over 90,000 E and I synapses across twelve L2/3 PNs and uncovered structured organization of E and I synapses across dendritic domains as well as within individual dendritic segments in these cells. Despite significant, domain-specific, variations in the absolute density of E and I synapses, their ratio is strikingly balanced locally across dendritic segments. Computational modeling indicates that this spatially-precise E/I balance dampens dendritic voltage fluctuations and strongly impacts neuronal firing output.",

    "abstract": "Arsenic contaminated ground water is a serious public health issue, and recent estimates place 150 million people worldwide at risk. Current chemical field test kits do not reliably detect arsenic at the lower end of the relevant range, and may generate toxic intermediates and waste. Whole-cell biosensors potentially provide an inexpensive, robust and analyte-specific solution to this problem. The second generation of a Bacillus subtilis-based arsenic biosensor, designated Bacillosensor-II, was constructed using the native chromosomal ars promoter, arsR and the reporter gene xylE encoding catechol-2,3-dioxygenase. Within four hours, Bacillosensor-II can detect arsenic in the form of arsenate AsO43- at levels more than one order of magnitude below the recommended safe limit for drinking water suggested by the World Health Organisation (10 {micro}g/L). Detection is reported by the enzymatic conversion of the inexpensive substrate catechol to 2-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconic semialdehyde, a bright yellow product visible by eye. We hope that this work will aid in developing a simple inexpensive field test kit for screening of drinking water for arsenic contamination.",

    "abstract": "The pesticide imidacloprid, a Neonicotinoid, is widely used and commercially available. Neonicotinoids are antagonists at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which can cause neurobehavioral effects in developing organisms. While the effects of other insecticides such as Malathion and Fipronil on zebrafish Danio rerio development have been studied, few studies describe the morphological effects of imidacloprid during zebrafish development. To test the hypothesis that imidacloprid concentration positively correlates to increased mortality and decreased body length, we exposed zebrafish to imidacloprid for five days post fertilization. Body length and embryo mortality were recorded at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days post fertilization in 0 ug/L, 100 ug/L, 1,000 ug/L, and 10,000 ug/L imidacloprid concentrations. These concentrations were chosen to mimic levels that could be reached in the environment especially soon after application. Our results demonstrate statistically increased embryo mortality, with a f crit value of 3.193 and a f value of 3.098 from an ANOVA test, and impaired body length with a dose dependent correlation to the concentration of imidacloprid and a P value of less than 0.01 from a T test.

The Hoxa10 and Hoxa11 genes have previously been shown to play essential roles in uterus development and function. In this report we show that the Hoxc9,10,11 genes play a redundant role in the formation of uterine glands. In addition, we use single cell RNA-seq to create a high resolution gene expression atlas of the developing wild type mouse uterus. Cell types and subtypes are defined, for example dividing endothelial cells into arterial, venous, capillary, and lymphatic, while epithelial cells separate into luminal and glandular subtypes. Further, a surprising heterogeneity of stromal and myocyte cell types are identified. Transcription factor codes and ligand/receptor interactions are characterized. We also used single cell RNA-seq to globally define the altered gene expression patterns in all developing uterus cell types for two Hox mutants, with 8 or 9 mutant Hox genes. The mutants show a striking disruption of Wnt signaling as well as the Cxcl12/Cxcr4 ligand/receptor axis.\\n\\nSummary statementA single cell RNA-seq study of the developing mouse uterus defines cellular heterogeneities, lineage specific gene expression programs and perturbed pathways in Hox9,10,11 mutants.",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based treatment has been demonstrated beneficial for RGC against degeneration. However, underlying mechanisms of MSC-provided RGC protection are largely unknown other than neuropectective paracrine actions. In this study, we sought to investigate whether mitochondrial donation can preserve RGC functions, in a mitochondrial Ndufs4 deficient mouse model of RGC degeneration. The results revealed intravitreal transplanted by induced pluripotent stem cell derived-MSCs (iPSC-MSC) could donate their mitochondria through crossing inner limited membrane to host RGCs. Furthermore, the donated mitochondria effectively protected against RGC death and largely preserved retinal function in Ndufs4-KO mice. Importantly, the protective effects of mitochondrial donation from MSCs were associated with management of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our data identified a novel role of MSCs-mitochondrial donation in protection of RGC from degeneration, and highlight a viable therapeutic strategy by manipulating stem cell mitochondrial donation for the treatment of retina degeneration in future.",

    "abstract": "A multidimensional inflammatory response ensues after status epilepticus (SE), driven partly by cyclooxygenase-2 mediated activation of prostaglandin EP2 receptors. Here we identify those effects of EP2 antagonism that are reproduced by conditional ablation of EP2 receptors in immune myeloid cells and forebrain neurons. Removal of myeloid cell EP2 dampened induction of hippocampal IL-6, prevented erosion of the blood-brain barrier, accelerated weight regain, and relieved ptosis following SE. Elimination of EP2 receptor from neurons enhanced neuronal injury, elevated hippocampal induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF and Ccl2, promoted deterioration of the blood-brain barrier, delayed weight recovery, and worsened animal posture and activity. Taken together these data highlight the complexities in neuroinflammatory signaling, wherein activation of EP2 receptors in innate immune cells is deleterious but neuronal EP2 signaling is protective. Effective treatments targeting brain prostaglandin signaling pathways should be cell targeted to be optimally effective.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSeizures reduce quality of life, promote the development of epilepsy, and can be fatal. We previously identified inflammation, via prostaglandin receptor EP2 activation, as a driver of undesirable seizure-induced effects. However, the relevant EP2-expressing cell types remain unclear. We identify innate immune cells as a driver of the EP2-related negative consequences of seizures, whereas neuronal EP2 signaling is protective. Genetic removal of EP2 from immune cells was beneficial, accelerating weight gain and limiting behavioral deficits. Elimination of EP2 from neurons was harmful, worsening behavioral deficits and promoting neuronal damage. These findings enhance our understanding of the complex inflammatory processes engaged after seizures and will assist in the development of beneficial therapies to enhance quality of life in individuals susceptible to seizures.",

Regularly repeating events are often perceived as a rhythm to which we can readily synchronize our movements, just as in dancing to music. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the capacity to encode and maintain rhythms are not understood. We trained nonhuman primates to maintain the rhythm of a visual metronome of different tempos and then we recorded neural activity in the supplementary motor area (SMA). SMA exhibited rhythmic bursts of gamma band (30-40 Hz) reflecting an internal tempo that matched the extinguished visual metronome. Moreover, gamma amplitude increased throughout the trial and provided an estimate of total elapsed time. Notably, the timing and amplitude of gamma bursts reflected systematic timing biases and errors in the behavioral responses. Our results indicate that premotor areas use dynamic motor plans to encode a metronome for rhythms and a stopwatch for total elapsed time.",

    "abstract": "Natural rubber is an indispensable commodity used in approximately 40,000 products and is fundamental to the tire industry. Among the species that produce latex, the rubber tree [Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex Adr. de Juss.) Muell-Arg.], a species native to the Amazon rainforest, is the major producer of latex used worldwide. The Amazon Basin presents optimal conditions for rubber tree growth, but the occurrence of South American leaf blight, which is caused by the fungus Microcyclus ulei (P. Henn) v. Arx, limits rubber tree production. Currently, rubber tree plantations are located in scape regions that exhibit suboptimal conditions such as high winds and cold temperatures. Rubber tree breeding programs aim to identify clones that are adapted to these stress conditions. However, rubber tree breeding is time-consuming, taking more than 20 years to develop a new variety. It is also expensive and requires large field areas. Thus, genetic studies could optimize field evaluations, thereby reducing the time and area required for these experiments. Transcriptome sequencing using next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful tool to identify a full set of transcripts and for evaluating gene expression in model and non-model species. In this study, we constructed a comprehensive transcriptome to evaluate the cold response strategies of the RRIM600 (cold-resistant) and GT1 (cold-tolerant) genotypes. Furthermore, we identified putative microsatellite (SSR) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Alternative splicing, which is an important mechanism for plant adaptation under abiotic stress, was further identified, providing an important database for further studies of cold tolerance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStreptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (SPE)A expression is epidemiologically linked to streptococcal tonsillo-pharyngitis and outbreaks of scarlet fever, although the mechanisms by which superantigens confer advantage Streptococcus pyogenes are unclear. S. pyogenes is an exclusively human pathogen. As the leukocyte profile of tonsil differs from peripheral blood, the impact of SPEA production on human tonsil cell function was investigated.\\n\\nMethodsHuman tonsil cells from routine tonsillectomy, were co-incubated with purified streptococcal superantigens or isogenic streptococcal culture supernatants, differing only in superantigen content. Tonsil cell proliferation was quantified by tritium-incorporation, and cell surface characteristics assessed by flow-cytometry. Soluble mediators were measured using ELISA and quantitative (q)RT-PCR was performed for immunoglobulin gene expression.\\n\\nResultsTonsil T cells proliferated in response to SPEA and demonstrated typical release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. When cultured in the absence of superantigen, tonsil preparations released large quantities of immunoglobulin over 7d. In contrast, marked B cell apoptosis and abrogation of total IgA, IgM, and IgG production occurred in the presence of SPEA and other superantigens. In SPEA-stimulated cultures, T follicular helper (TfH) cells showed a reduction in CXCR5 expression, but up-regulation of CD134 (OX40), CD278 (ICOS) and CD150 (SLAM) expression, indicative of a phenotypic change in the TfH population and associated with impaired chemotactic response to CXCL13.\\n\\nConclusionsSPEA and other superantigens cause dysregulated tonsil immune function, driving T cells from TFH to a proliferating phenotype, with resultant loss of B cells and immunoglobulin production, providing superantigen-producing bacteria with a likely survival advantage.",

    "abstract": "Atypical El Tor strains of Vibrio cholerae O1 harboring variant ctxB genes of cholera toxin (CT) are gradually becoming a major cause of recent cholera epidemics. Vibrio mimicus occasionally contains virulence factors associated with cholera, e.g., CT, encoded by ctxAB on CTX[FE] genome; and TCP, the CTX[FE]-specific receptor. This study carried out extensive molecular characterization of CTX[FE] and ToxT regulon in ctx+ve strains of V. mimicus isolated from the Bengal coast. Southern hybridization, PCR, and DNA sequencing of virulence related-genes revealed the presence of an El Tor type CTX prophage (CTXET) carrying a novel ctxAB, tandem copies of environmental type pre-CTX prophage (pre-CTXEnv), and RS1 elements, which were organized in an array of RS1-CTXET-RS1-pre-CTXEnv-pre-CTXEnv. Additionally, a novel variant of tcpA and toxT respectively, showing clonal lineage to a phylogenetic clade of V. cholerae non-O1/O139, was identified. The V. mimicus strains lacked the RTX and TLC elements, and Vibrio seventh pandemic islands of the El Tor strains, but contained five heptamer (TTTTGAT) repeats in ctxAB promoter region like some classical strains of V. cholerae O1. PFGE analysis showed all the ctx+ve V. mimicus strains were clonally related. However, their in vitro CT production and in vivo toxigenecity were variable, which could be explained by differential transcription of virulence genes along with ToxR regulon. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that environmental V. mimicus strains act as potential reservoir of atypical virulence factors, including variant CT and ToxT regulon, and may contribute to the evolution of V. cholerae hybrid strains.\\n\\nIMPORTANCENatural diversification of CTX[FE] and ctxAB genes certainly influences disease severity and shifting patterns in major etiological agents of cholera, e.g., the overwhelming emergence of hybrid El Tor variants, replacing the prototype El Tor strains of V. cholerae. This study showing the occurrence of CTXET comprising a novel variant of ctxAB in V. mimicus points out a previously unnoticed evolutionary event, independent to that of the El Tor strains of V. cholerae. Identification and cluster analysis of the newly-discovered alleles of tcpA and toxT indicates their horizontal transfer from an uncommon clone of V. cholerae. The genomic content of ToxT regulon, and tandemly arranged multiple pre-CTX[FE]Env and a CTX[FE]ET in V. mimicus probably act as salient raw materials inducing natural recombination among the hallmark virulence genes of hybrid V. cholerae strains. This study will facilitate deeper understanding of the evolution of new variant CT and ToxT regulon, influencing cholera epidemiology.",

    "abstract": "Buruli ulcer (BU), caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is a neglected tropical skin and soft tissue infection that is associated with disability and social stigma. The mainstay of BU treatment is an eight-week course of 10 mg/kg rifampin (RIF) and 150 mg/kg streptomycin (STR). Recently, the injectable STR has been shown to be replaceable with oral clarithromycin (CLR) for smaller lesions for the last four weeks of treatment. A shorter, all-oral, highly efficient regimen for BU is needed, as the long treatment duration and indirect costs currently burden patients and health systems. Increasing the dose of RIF or replacing it with the more potent rifamycin drug rifapentine (RPT) could provide such a regimen. Here, we performed a dose-ranging experiment of RIF and RPT in combination with CLR over four weeks of treatment in a mouse model of M. ulcerans disease. A clear dose-dependent effect of RIF on both clinical and microbiological outcomes was found, with no ceiling effect observed with tested doses up to 40 mg/kg. RPT-containing regimens were more effective on M. ulcerans. All RPT-containing regimens achieved culture negativity after only four weeks while only the regimen with the highest RIF dose (40 mg/kg) did so. We conclude that there is dose-dependent efficacy of both RIF and RPT and that a ceiling effect is not reached with the current standard regimen used in the clinic. A regimen based on higher rifamycin doses that are currently being evaluated against tuberculosis in clinical trials could shorten and improve therapy of Buruli ulcer.",

Here, we manipulated the presentation duration of backward-masked facial expressions and used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate the computations underpinning rapid face processing. Multivariate analyses revealed two stages in face perception, with the ventral visual stream encoding facial features prior to facial configuration. When presentation time was reduced, the emergence of sustained featural and configural representations was delayed. Importantly, these representations explained behaviour during an expression recognition task. Together, these results describe the adaptable system linking visual features, brain and behaviour during face perception.",

This year, two separate outbreaks of EBOV in the Democratic Republic of Congo underscored the unpredictable nature of ebolavirus reemergence in a region that has historically experienced outbreaks of the divergent ebolaviruses Sudan virus (SUDV) and Bundibugyo virus (BDBV)5. Here we show that MBP134AF, a pan-ebolavirus therapeutic comprising two broadly neutralizing human antibodies (bNAbs)6,7(see companion manuscript, Wec et al.) could protect against lethal EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV infection in ferrets and nonhuman primates (NHPs). MBP134AF not only not only establishes a viable therapeutic countermeasure to outbreaks caused by antigenically diverse ebolaviruses but also affords unprecedented effectiveness and potency--a single 25-mg/kg dose was fully protective in NHPs. This best-in-class antibody cocktail is the culmination of an intensive collaboration spanning academia, industry and government in response to the 2013-2016 EBOV epidemic6,7 and provides a translational research model for the rapid development of immunotherapeutics targeting emerging infectious diseases.",

We approach this by addressing three computational hypotheses, and provide a publicly-available repository containing data and images for further analysis.

    "abstract": "IntroductionAll nations of the Greater Mekong Subregion have committed to elimination of malaria by the year 2030. Elimination efforts rely on increasing access to diagnosis and treatment. However, asymptomatic infections pose a major challenge for these efforts. One approach towards eliminating asymptomatic reservoirs is targeted mass antimalarial drug administration (MDA). Here we present a fine scale spatiotemporal analysis of malaria incidence and prevalence in villages undergoing MDA.\\n\\nMethodsFour villages along the Myanmar-Thailand border were selected for a MDA pilot study based on clinical records and prevalence surveys. Passive detection of clinical episodes was facilitated through community based malaria clinics in each village. All villagers were screened using venous blood and ultra-sensitive qPCR (uPCR) for detection of parasites at baseline and every subsequent 3 months until month 18 (M18). A final screening was done at M24. MDAs were conducted on M0, M1 and M2 in two villages and on M9, M10, M11 in the remaining two villages. Which villages received early or deferred MDA was decided using restricted randomization. MDA participation, clinical episodes and uPCR detected infections were mapped to participant houses. Scan statistics were used to test for clusters of malaria episodes, malaria infections and non-adherence to MDA. Mixed effects regressions were used to test for risk factors for clinical episodes after MDA.\\n\\nResultsNeighborhood level MDA adherence was a major predictor for clinical episodes of malaria post-MDA, suggesting a strong herd effect. Each village had a cluster of P. falciparum infections at M0. After M0, there were no clusters of uPCR detectable P. falciparum infections. Clinical episodes of P. falciparum occurred in one village only which had a cluster of non-adherence to MDA and a high mosquito vector human biting rate. Individuals with subclinical P.falciparum infections were more likely to have subsequent clinical episodes than individuals who had no subclinical infections. Individuals who lived in a house with someone who had a clinical episode were more likely to also have a clinical episode subsequently than individuals residing in a house free of P.falciparum infections.\\n\\nConclusionTo our knowledge this is the first study to show a herd effect from MDA for malaria. These data and results have significance for spatial targeting of interventions for malaria elimination. Clusters of non-adherence to MDA participation can lead to failed elimination if they occur among individuals with asymptomatic infections and given sufficient mosquito vector exposure. Community participation, which can be facilitated through community engagement, is key to MDA success.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus anthracis is a spore-forming, Gram-positive bacterium responsible for anthrax, an acute and commonly lethal infection that most significantly affects grazing livestock, wild ungulates and other herbivorous mammals, but also poses a serious threat to human health1, 2. The geographic extent of B. anthracis endemism is still poorly understood, despite multi-decade research on anthrax epizootic and epidemic dynamics around the world3, 4. Several biogeographic studies have focused on modeling environmental suitability for anthrax at local or national scales5-9, but many countries have limited or inadequate surveillance systems, even within known endemic regions. Here we compile an extensive global occurrence dataset for B. anthracis, drawing on confirmed human, livestock, and wildlife anthrax outbreaks. With these records, we use boosted regression trees10, 11 to produce the first map of the global distribution of B. anthracis as a proxy for anthrax risk. Variable contributions to the model support pre-existing hypotheses that environmental suitability for B. anthracis depends most strongly on soil characteristics such as pH that affect spore persistence, and the extent of seasonal fluctuations in vegetation, which plays a key role in transmission for herbivores12, 13. We apply the global model to estimate that 1.83 billion people (95% credible interval: 0.59--4.16 billion) live within regions of anthrax risk, but most of that population faces little occupational exposure to anthrax. More informatively, a global total of 63.8 million rural poor livestock keepers (95% CI: 17.5--168.6 million) and 1.1 billion livestock (95% CI: 0.4--2.3 billion) live within vulnerable regions. Human risk is concentrated in rural areas, and human and livestock vulnerability are both concentrated in rainfed systems throughout arid and temperate land across Eurasia, Africa, and North America. We conclude by mapping where anthrax risk overlaps with vulnerable wild ungulate populations, and therefore could disrupt sensitive conservation efforts for species like bison, pronghorn, and saiga that coincide with anthrax-prone, mixed-agricultural landscapes. Anthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis, a generalist soil-transmitted pathogen found on every inhabited continent14, and several islands including Haiti and parts of the Philippines and Indonesia. Worldwide, an estimated 20,000 to 100,000 cases of anthrax occur annually, mostly in poor rural areas15. In clinical presentations of anthrax, case fatality rates are a function of exposure pathway. Respiratory exposure from spore inhalation is important the context of bioterrorism, but is highly uncommon, and accounts for a negligible fraction of the global burden of anthrax cases. Cutaneous exposure to B. anthracis accounts for the majority of human cases worldwide, and typically presents with low mortality; gastrointestinal exposure accounts for the remainder and presents with intermediate to high fatality rates. Cutaneous and gastrointestinal cases of anthrax are most commonly caused by handling and slaughtering infected livestock, or butchering and eating contaminated meat; untreated gastrointestinal cases likely account for most human mortality from anthrax.14-16",

    "abstract": "The water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) has shown enormous milk production potential in many Asian countries. India is considered as the home tract of some of the best buffalo breeds. However, genetic structure of the Indian river buffalo is poorly understood. Hence, for selection and breeding strategies, there is a need to characterize the populations and understand the genetic structure of various buffalo breeds. In this study, we have analysed genetic variability and population structure of seven buffalo breeds from their respective geographical regions using Axiom(R) Buffalo Genotyping Array having 124,030 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). Blood samples were obtained from 302 buffaloes comprising Murrah, Nili-Ravi, Mehsana, Jaffarabadi, Banni, Pandharpuri and Surti breeds. Diversity, as measured by expected heterozygosity (He) ranged from 0.364 in the Surti to 0.384 in the Murrah breed. All the breeds showed negligible inbreeding coefficient. Pair-wise FST values revealed the lowest genetic distance between Mehsana and Nili-Ravi (0.0022) while highest between Surti and Pandharpuri (0.030). Principal component analysis and structure analysis unveiled the differentiation of Surti, Pandharpuri and Jaffarabadi in first two PCs, while remaining breeds were grouped together as a separate single cluster. Murrah and Mehsana showed early linkage disequilibrium decay while Surti breed showed late decay, similarly LD based Ne was drastically declined for Murrah and Mehsana since last 100 generations. In LD blocks to QTLs concordance analysis, 14.19 per cent of concordance was observed with 873 (out of 1144) LD blocks overlapped with 8912 (out of 67804) QTLs. Overall, total 4090 markers were identified from all LD blocks for six types of traits. Results of this study indicated that these SNP markers could differentiate phenotypically distinct breeds like Surti,Pandharpuri and Jaffarabadi but not others. So, there is a need to develop SNP chip based on SNP markers identified by sequence information of local breeds.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIndian buffaloes, through 13 recognised breeds, contribute about 49% in total milk production and play a vital role in enhancing the economic condition of Indian farmers. High density genotyping these breeds will allow us to study differences at the molecular level. Evolutionary relationship and phenotypes relations with genotype could be tested with high density genotyping. Breed structure analysis helps to take effective breeding policy decision. In the present study, we have used the high-throughput microarray based genotyping technology for SNP markers. These markers were used for breed differentiation using various genetic parameters. Population structure reflected the proportion of breed admixture among studied breeds. We have also tried to dig the markers associated with traits based LD calculation. However, these SNPs couldnt explain obvious variation up to the expected level, hence, there is need to develop an indigenous SNP chip based on Indian buffalo populations.",

    "abstract": "Disruptive innovations in long-range, cost-effective direct template nucleic acid sequencing are transforming clinical and diagnostic medicine. A multidrug resistant strain and a pan-susceptible strain of Mannheimia haemolytica, isolated from pneumonic bovine lung samples, were respectively sequenced at 146x and 111x coverage with Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION. De novo assembly produced a complete genome for the non-resistant strain and a nearly complete assembly for the drug resistant strain. Functional annotation using RAST (Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology), CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database) and ResFinder databases identified genes conferring resistance to different classes of antibiotics including beta lactams, tetracyclines, lincosamides, phenicols, aminoglycosides, sulfonamides and macrolides. Antibiotic resistance phenotypes of the M. haemolytica strains were confirmed with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays. The sequencing capacity of highly portable MinION devices was verified by sub-sampling sequencing reads; potential for antimicrobial resistance determined by identification of resistance genes in the draft assemblies with as little as 5,437 MinION reads corresponded to all classes of MIC assays. The resulting quality assemblies and AMR gene annotation highlight efficiency of ultra long-read, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) as a valuable tool in diagnostic veterinary medicine.",

    "abstract": "Targeting protein kinases is an important strategy for intervention in cancer. Inhibitors are directed at the active conformation or a variety of inactive conformations. While attempts have been made to classify these conformations, a structurally rigorous catalogue of states has not been achieved. The kinase activation loop is crucial for catalysis and begins with the conserved DFGmotif (Asp-Phe-Gly). This motif is observed in two major classes of conformations, DFGin - a set of active and inactive conformations where the Phe residue is in contact with the C-helix of the N-terminal lobe, and DFGout - an inactive form where Phe occupies the ATP site exposing the C-helix pocket. We have developed a clustering of kinase conformations based on the location of the Phe side chain (DFGin, DFGout, and DFGinter or intermediate) and the backbone dihedral angles of the sequence X-D-F, where X is the residue before the DFGmotif, and the DFG-Phe side-chain rotamer, utilizing a density-based clustering algorithm. We have identified 8 distinct conformations and labeled them based on their Ramachandran regions (A=alpha, B=beta, L=left) and the Phe rotamer (minus, plus, trans). Our clustering divides the DFGin group into six clusters including  BLAminus, which contains active structures, and two common inactive forms,  BLBplus and  ABAminus. DFGout structures are predominantly in the  BBAminus conformation, which is essentially required for binding Type II inhibitors. The inactive conformations have specific features that make them unable to bind ATP, magnesium ion, and/or substrates. Our structurally intuitive nomenclature will aid in understanding the conformational dynamics of these proteins and structure-based development of kinase drugs.\\n\\nSignificance statementProtein kinases play important roles in signaling pathways and are widely studied as drug targets. Their active site exhibits remarkable structural variation as observed in the large number of available crystal structures. We have developed a clustering scheme and nomenclature to categorize and label all the observed conformations in human protein kinases. This has enabled us to clearly define the geometry of the active state and to distinguish closely related inactive states which were previously not characterized. Our classification of kinase conformations will help in better understanding the conformational dynamics of these proteins and the development of inhibitors against them.",

    "abstract": "The repair of DNA double-strand breaks occurs through non-homologous end joining or homologous recombination in vertebrate cells - a choice that is thought to be decided by a competition between DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) complex but is not well understood. Using ensemble biochemistry and single-molecule approaches, here we show that the MRN complex is dependent on DNA-PK and phosphorylated CtIP to perform efficient processing and resection of DNA ends in physiological conditions, thus eliminating the competition model. Endonucleolytic removal of DNA-PK-bound DNA ends is also observed at double-strand break sites in human cells. The involvement of DNA-PK in MRN-mediated end processing promotes an efficient and sequential transition from non-homologous end joining to homologous recombination by facilitating DNA-PK removal.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryDNA-dependent protein kinase, an enzyme critical for non-homologous repair of DNA double-strand breaks, also stimulates end processing for homologous recombination.",

    "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells are part of the innate immune system and are capable of killing diseased cells. As a result, NK cells are being used for adoptive cell therapies for cancer patients. The activation of NK cell stimulatory receptors leads to a cascade of intracellular phosphorylation reactions, which activates key signaling species that facilitate the secretion of cytolytic molecules required for cell killing. Strategies that maximize the activation of such intracellular species can increase the likelihood of NK cell activation upon contact with a cancer cell, and thereby improve efficacy of NK cell-based therapies. However, due to the complexity of intracellular signaling, it is difficult to deduce a priori which strategies can enhance species activation. Therefore, we constructed a mechanistic model of the CD16, 2B4 and NKG2D signaling pathways in NK cells to simulate strategies that enhance signaling. The model predictions were fit to published data and validated with a separate dataset. Model simulations demonstrate strong network activation when the CD16 pathway is stimulated. The magnitude of species activation is most sensitive to the receptor concentration and the rate at which the receptor is deactivated. Co-stimulation of CD16 and NKG2D in silico required fewer ligands to achieve half-maximal activation than other combinations, suggesting co-stimulating these pathways is most effective in activating the species. We applied the model to predict the effects of perturbing the signaling network and found two strategies that can potently enhance network activation. When the availability of ligands is low, it is more influential to engineer NK cell receptors that are resistant to proteolytic cleavage. In contrast, for high ligand concentrations, inhibiting phosphatase activity leads to more activation. The work presented here establishes a framework for understanding the complex, nonlinear aspects of NK cell signaling and provides detailed strategies for enhancing NK cell activation.",

    "abstract": "Morphology of the nucleus is an important regulator of gene-expression. Nuclear morphology is in turn a function of the forces acting on it and the mechanical properties of the nuclear envelope. Here, we present a two-parameter, non-dimensional mechanical model of the nucleus that reveals a relationship among nuclear shape parameters such as projected area, surface area and volume. Our model fits the morphology of individual nuclei and predicts the ratio between forces and modulus in each nucleus. We analyzed the changes in nuclear morphology of liver cells due to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection using this model. The model predicted a decrease in the elastic modulus of the nuclear envelope and an increase in the pre-tension in cortical actin as the causes for the change in nuclear morphology. These predictions were validated biomechanically by showing that liver cells expressing HCV proteins possessed enhanced cellular stiffness and reduced nuclear stiffness. Concomitantly, cells expressing HCV proteins showed down-regulation of lamin-A,C and up-regulation of actin, corroborating the predictions of the model. Our modelling assumptions are broadly applicable to adherent, monolayer cell cultures making the model amenable to investigate changes in nuclear mechanics due to other stimuli by merely measuring nuclear morphology. Towards this, we present two techniques, graphical and numerical, to use our model for predicting physical changes in the nucleus.",
