    "abstract": "AimIdentify basic requirements for a metagenomic nanopore sequencing protocol permitting frequent application in a clinical microbiology daily routine diagnostic setting.\\n\\nBackgroundNanopore sequencing with the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION device has a potential to markedly improve clinical diagnosis of infections. Reports have emerged recently that it may provide direct-from-clinical-sample information; for example, with urine samples, bronchial tuberculosis samples and orthopedic prostheses. However, the ideal protocol for clinical use remains to be determined, especially relating to detection of relevant pathogen quantities and to finding a reasonable level of economic costs.\\n\\nResultsMinION can provide qualitatively and quantitatively correct identification of multiple species in metagenomics samples. For detection of clinically relevant quantities of bacteria (on a nanogram DNA level) there is a need for carrier DNA. Importantly, high-purity DNA and a naive MinION flow cell seem to be critical parameters.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results suggest that high-purity clinical sample DNA, addition of carrier DNA and a naive flow cell are critical factors for clinical use of MinION. A relatively high error rate may limit detection of antimicrobial resistance genes, and a realistic level of costs will require availability of a price-reduced and single-use flowcell.",

On a cellular level, it functions in Parvalbumin-positive interneurons to recruit thalamocortical terminals. This controls the maturation of inhibitory drive and restricts plasticity in the cortex. These results reveal the synaptic locus of cortical plasticity and identify the first cell-autonomous synaptic factor for closure of cortical critical periods.\\n\\nSummaryBrain plasticity peaks early in life and tapers in adulthood. This is exemplified in the primary visual cortex, where brief loss of vision to one eye abrogates cortical responses to inputs from that eye during the critical period, but not in adulthood. The synaptic locus of critical period plasticity and the cell-autonomous synaptic factors timing these periods remain unclear. We here demonstrate that the immunoglobulin protein Synaptic Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (SynCAM 1/Cadm1) is regulated by visual experience and limits visual cortex plasticity. SynCAM 1 selectively controls the number of excitatory thalamocortical (TC) inputs onto Parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons and loss of SynCAM 1 in turn impairs the maturation of TC-driven feed-forward inhibition. SynCAM 1 acts in cortical PV+ interneurons to perform these functions and its PV+-specific knockdown prevents the age-related plasticity decline. These results identify a synapse type-specific, cell-autonomous mechanism that governs circuit maturation and closes the visual critical period.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA longstanding view holds that information is maintained in working memory (WM) via persistent neural activity that encodes the content of WM. Recent work, however, has challenged the view that all items stored in WM are actively maintained. Instead, \\\"activity-silent\\\" models propose that items can be maintained in WM without the need for persistent neural activity, raising the possibility that only a subset of items - perhaps just a single item - may be actively represented at a given time. While past studies have successfully decoded multiple items stored in WM, these studies cannot rule out an active switching account in which only a single item is actively represented at a time. Here, we directly tested whether multiple representations can be held concurrently in an active state. We tracked spatial representations in WM using alpha-band (8-12 Hz) activity, which encodes spatial positions held in WM. Human observers (male and female) remembered one or two positions over a short delay while we recorded EEG. Using a spatial encoding model, we reconstructed stimulus-specific working memory representations (channel tuning functions, CTFs) from the scalp distribution of alphaband power. Consistent with past work, we found the selectivity of spatial CTFs was lower when two items were stored than when one item was stored. Critically, data-driven simulations revealed that the selectivity of spatial representations in the two-item condition could not be explained by models restricting storage to a single item at a time. Thus, our findings provide robust evidence for the concurrent storage of multiple items in visual working memory.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWorking memory (WM) is a mental workspace where we temporarily hold information \\\"online\\\" in pursuit of our current goals. However, recent activity-silent models of WM have challenged the view that all items are held in an \\\"online\\\" state, instead proposing that only a subset of representations in WM - perhaps just one item - are represented by persistent activity at a time. To directly test a single-item model of persistent activity, we used a spatial encoding model to read out the strength of two representations from alpha-band (8-12 Hz) power in the human EEG signal. We provide direct evidence that both locations were maintained concurrently, ruling out the possibility that declines in stimulus-specific activity are due to storing one of two items in an activity-silent state.",

    "abstract": "Low stability and asymmetrical gait are two important challenges in gait of individuals with trans-tibial amputation. The aim of this case report was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a real-time video feedback of foot placement on stability (i.e. foot placement regularity) and symmetry of trans-tibial amputees. Furthermore, we aimed at differentiating the effect of video feedback from front, back and lateral views on amputees walking. Seven male participants with unilateral trans-tibial amputation took part in this study. Each participant walked for 2 minutes in four conditions: no video feedback, video feedback from front view, video feedback from back view and video feedback from lateral view. Participants motion was recorded using five motion capture cameras. Nonlinear measure of sample entropy was adopted to quantify foot placement regularity (i.e. stability). The symmetry of step length and width was also determined using symmetry angle algorithm. Results demonstrated that video feedback significantly led to more regular and more symmetrical step length. Our findings suggest that amputees rely on visual feedback to have more stable and more symmetrical gait. The findings of this study suggest that implementing of video feedback gait training could reduce neuromusculoskeletal problems resulted from asymmetrical gait.",

However, it is necessary that these modulations can be reliably detected. Here, we apply a cross-validated predictive model to classify emotional valence and pharmacologic effect across eleven task-based fMRI datasets (n=306) exploring the effect of antidepressant administration on emotional face processing.\\n\\nMethodsWe created subject-level contrast of parameter estimates of the emotional faces task and used the Shen whole-brain parcellation scheme to define 268 subject-level features that trained a cross-validated gradient-boosting machine protocol to classify emotional valence (fearful vs happy face visual conditions) and pharmacologic effect (drug vs placebo administration) within and across studies.\\n\\nResultsWe found patterns of brain activity that classify emotional valence with a statistically significant level of accuracy (70% across-all-subjects; range from 50-87% across-study). Our classifier failed to consistently discriminate drug from placebo. Subject population (healthy or unhealthy), treatment group (drug or placebo), and drug administration protocol (dose and duration) affected this accuracy with similar populations better predicting one another.\\n\\nConclusionsWe found limited evidence that antidepressants modulated brain response in a consistent manner, however found a consistent signature for emotional valence. Variable functional patterns across studies suggest that predictive modeling can inform biomarker development in mental health and in pharmacotherapy development.

    "abstract": "Humans have remarkable visual long-term memory abilities, capable of storing thousands of objects with significant detail. However, it remains unknown how such memory is utilized during the short-term maintenance of information. Specifically, if people have a previously encoded memory for an item, how does this affect subsequent working memory for that same item? Here, we demonstrate people can quickly and accurately make use of visual long-term memories and therefore maintain less perceptual information actively in working memory. We assessed how much perceptual information is actively maintained in working memory by measuring neural activity during the delay period of a working memory task using electroencephalography. We find that despite maintaining less perceptual information in working memory when long-term memory representations are available, there is no decrement in memory performance. This suggests under certain circumstances people can dynamically disengage working memory maintenance and instead use long-term memories when available. However, this does not mean participants always utilize long-term memory. In a follow-up experiment, we introduced additional perceptual interference into working memory and found participants actively maintained items in working memory even when they had existing long-term memories available. These results clarify the kinds of conditions under which long-term and working memory operate. Specifically, working memory is engaged when new information is encountered or perceptual interference is high. Visual long-term memory may otherwise be rapidly accessed and utilized in lieu of active perceptual maintenance. These data demonstrate the interactions between working memory and long-term memory are more dynamic and fluid than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive processes are almost exclusively investigated under highly controlled settings while voluntary body movements are suppressed. However, recent animal work suggests differences in sensory processing between movement states by showing drastically changed neural responses in early visual areas between locomotion and stillness. Does locomotion also modulate visual cortical activity in humans and what are its perceptual consequences? Here, we present converging neurophysiological and behavioural evidence that walking leads to an increased influence of peripheral stimuli on central visual input. This modulation of visual processing due to walking is encompassed by a change in alpha oscillations, which is suggestive of an attentional shift to the periphery during walking. Overall, our study shows that strategies of sensory information processing can differ between movement states. This finding further demonstrates that a comprehensive understanding of human perception and cognition critically depends on the consideration of natural behaviour.",

Yet its impact on behavior and neural coding is not well understood. Combining pupillometry with cellular calcium imaging measurements of thalamocortical axons in awake behaving mice, we examined the impact of arousal and behavioral state on encoding of visual motion in the visual thalamus. We discovered that back-to-front visual motions elicits a robust behavioral response that shapes tunings of visual thalamic responses. Consistent with an arousal mechanism, the effects were pronounced during stillness and weak or absent during locomotor activity and under anesthesia. The impact on neuronal tuning was specific, biasing population response patterns in favor of back-to-front motion. The potent influence of visual motion on behavioral state dynamically affect sensory coding at early visual processing stages.

    "abstract": "The rapid development in quantitatively measuring DNA, RNA, and protein has generated a great interest in the development of reverse-engineering methods, that is, data-driven approaches to infer the network structure or dynamical model of the system. Many reverse-engineering methods require discrete quantitative data as input, while many experimental data are continuous. Some studies have started to reveal the impact that the choice of data discretization has on the performance of reverse-engineering methods. However, more comprehensive studies are still greatly needed to systematically and quantitatively understand the impact that discretization methods have on inference methods. Furthermore, there is an urgent need for systematic comparative methods that can help select between discretization methods. In this work, we consider 4 published intracellular networks inferred with their respective time-series datasets. We discretized the data using different discretization methods. Across all datasets, changing the data discretization to a more appropriate one improved the reverse-engineering methods performance. We observed no universal best discretization method across different time-series datasets. Thus, we propose DiscreeTest, a two-step evaluation metric for ranking discretization methods for time-series data. The underlying assumption of DiscreeTest is that an optimal discretization method should preserve the dynamic patterns observed in the original data across all variables. We used the same datasets and networks to show that DiscreeTest is able to identify an appropriate discretization among several candidate methods. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a method for benchmarking and selecting an appropriate discretization method for time-series data has been proposed.\\n\\nAvailabilityAll the datasets, reverse-engineering methods and source code used in this paper are available in Vera-Liconas lab Github repository: https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/Benchmarking_TSDiscretizations",

    "abstract": "Characterisation of an organisms performance in different habitats provides insight into the conditions that allow it to survive and reproduce. In recent years, Northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus)--a medium-sized semi-arboreal marsupial native to northern Australia--have undergone significant population declines within open forest, woodland and riparian habitats, but less so in rocky areas. To explore this decline, we quantified the biomechanical performance of wild Northern quolls over inclined narrow (13 mm pole) and inclined wide (90 mm platform) substrates. We predicted that quolls may possess biomechanical adaptations to increase stability on narrow surfaces, which are more common in rocky habitats. Our results display that quolls have some biomechanical characteristics consistent with a stability advantage on narrow surfaces. This includes the coupled use of limb pairs and high grip torques (Max = 68.9 N.m, Min = -69.9 N.m), highlighting their ability to generate corrective forces to counteract the toppling moments commonly encountered during gait on narrow surfaces. However, unlike other arboreal specialists such as primates, speed was constrained on narrow surfaces, and quolls did not adopt diagonal sequence gaits. Quolls appear to adopt similar performance characteristics to cats and dogs which may limit their ability to outperform these key predators (invasive or otherwise) in particular habitats. This overlap may contribute to the declining population of Northern quolls on mainland Australia.",

Although differential expansion of elastic materials has been proposed to explain brain folding, the cellular and physical processes responsible at the time of folding have not been defined. Here we used the murine cerebellum, with 8-10 folds, as a tractable model to study brain folding. At folding initiation we considered the cerebellum as a bilayer system with a fluidlike outer layer of proliferating precursors and an incompressible core. We discovered that there is no obvious cellular pre-pattern for folding, since when folding initiates, the precursors within the outer layer have uniform sizes, shapes and proliferation, as well as a distribution of glial fibers. Furthermore, although differential expansion is created by the outer layer expanding faster than the core at folding initiation, thickness variations arise in the outer layer that are inconsistent with elastic material models. A multiphase model was applied that includes radial and circumferential tension and mechanical constraints derived from in vivo measurements. Our results demonstrate that cerebellar folding emerges from mechanical forces generated by uniform cell behaviors. We discuss how our findings apply to human cerebral cortex folding.",

A proteomics screen revealed that TSC1 loss most dramatically induced the expression of neprilysin (NEP/CD10) and aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13). The survival of TSC1 null human cancer cells was dependent on NEP expression, and TSC1 mutation sensitized cells to biochemical inhibition of APN.

    "abstract": "Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) occupy a substantial fraction of the genome and impact cellular function with both beneficial and deleterious consequences. The vast majority of HERV sequences descend from ancient retroviral families no longer capable of infection or genomic propagation. In fact, most are no longer represented by full-length proviruses but by solitary long terminal repeats (solo LTRs) that arose via non-allelic recombination events between the two LTRs of a proviral insertion. Because LTR-LTR recombination events may occur long after proviral insertion but are challenging to detect in resequencing data, we hypothesize that this mechanism produces an underappreciated amount of genomic variation in the human population. To test this idea, we develop a computational pipeline specifically designed to capture such dimorphic HERV alleles from short-read genome sequencing data. When applied to 279 individuals sequenced as part of the Simons Genome Diversity Project, the pipeline retrieves most of the dimorphic variants previously reported for the HERV-K(HML2) subfamily as well as dozens of additional candidates, including members of the HERV-H and HERV-W families. We experimentally validate several of these candidates, including the first reported instance of an unfixed HERV-W provirus. These data indicate that human proviral content exhibit more extensive interindividual variation than previously recognized. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the contribution of HERVs to human physiology and disease.",
