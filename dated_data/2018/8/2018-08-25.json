    "abstract": "In Chesapeake Bay, the soft-shell clam Mya arenaria (thin-shelled, deep-burrowing) exhibits population declines when predators are active and persists at low densities. In contrast, the hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria (thick-shelled, shallow-burrowing) has a stable population and age distribution. We examined the potential for habitat and predators to control densities and distributions of bivalves in a field caging experiment (Mya only) and laboratory mesocosm experiments (both species). In the field, clams exposed to predators experienced 76.3% greater mortality as compared to caged individuals, and blue crabs were likely responsible for most of the mortality of juvenile Mya. In mesocosm experiments, Mya had lower survival in sand and seagrass than in shell hash or oyster shell habitats. However, crabs often missed one or more prey in seagrass, shell, and oyster shell habitats. Predator search times and encounter rates declined when prey were at low densities, likely due to the added cost of inefficient foraging; however, this effect was more pronounced for Mya than for Mercenaria. Mercenaria had higher survival than Mya in mesocosm experiments, likely because predators feeding on Mercenaria spent less time foraging than those feeding on Mya. Mya may retain a low-density refuge from predation even with the loss of structurally complex habitats, though a loss of habitat refuge may result in clam densities that are not sustainable. A better understanding of density-dependent predator-prey interactions is necessary to prevent loss of food-web integrity and to conserve marine resources.",

    "abstract": "The longer cells stay in particular phases of the cell cycle, the longer it will take these cell populations to increase. However, the above qualitative description has very little predictive value, unless it can be codified mathematically. A quantitative relation that defines the population doubling time (Td) as a function of the time eukaryotic cells spend in specific cell cycle phases would be instrumental for estimating rates of cell proliferation and for evaluating introduced perturbations. Here, we show that in human cells the length of the G1 phase (TG1) regressed on Td with a slope of {approx}0.75, while in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the slope was slightly smaller, at {approx}0.60. On the other hand, cell size was not strongly associated with Td or TG1 in cell cultures that were proliferating at different rates. Furthermore, we show that levels of the yeast G1 cyclin Cln3p were positively associated with rates of cell proliferation over a broad range, at least in part through translational control mediated by a short uORF in the CLN3 transcript. Cln3p was also necessary for the proper scaling between TG1 and Td. In contrast, yeast lacking the Whi5p transcriptional repressor maintained the scaling between TG1 and Td. These data reveal fundamental scaling relations between the duration of eukaryotic cell cycle phases and rates of cell proliferation, point to the necessary role of Cln3p in these relations in yeast and provide a mechanistic basis linking Cln3p levels to proliferation rates and the scaling of G1 with doubling time.",

    "abstract": "Nodal-related protein (ndr2) is a member of the transforming growth factor type {beta} superfamily of factors and is required for ventral midline patterning of the embryonic central nervous system in zebrafish. In humans, mutations in the gene encoding nodal cause holoprosencephaly and heterotaxy. Mutations in the ndr2 gene in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) lead to similar phenotypes, including loss of the medial floor plate, severe deficits in ventral forebrain development, and cyclopia. Alleles of the ndr2 gene have been useful in studying patterning of ventral structures of the central nervous system. Fifteen different ndr2 alleles have been reported in zebrafish, of which eight were generated using chemical mutagenesis, four were radiation-induced, and the remaining alleles were obtained via random insertion, gene targeting (TALEN), or unknown methods. Therefore, most mutation sites were random and could not be predicted a priori. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes, we targeted distinct regions in all three exons of zebrafish ndr2 and observed cyclopia in the injected (G0) embryos. We show that the use of sgRNA-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes can cause penetrant cyclopic phenotypes in injected (G0) embryos. Targeted PCR amplicon analysis using Sanger sequencing showed that most of the alleles had small indels resulting in frameshifts. The sequence information correlates with the loss of ndr2 activity. In this study, we validate multiple CRISPR targets using an in vitro nuclease assay and in vivo analysis using embryos. We describe one specific mutant allele resulting in loss of conserved terminal cysteine-coding sequences. This study is another demonstration of the utility of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in generating domain- specific mutations and provides further insights into the structure-function of the ndr2 gene.",

    "abstract": "Maturation of attentional processes is central to cognitive development. The electrophysiological P300 is associated with rapid allocation of attention, and bridges stimulus and response processing. P300 is among the most studied and robust electrophysiological components, but how different subcomponents of the P300 develop from childhood to adulthood and relate to structural properties of the cerebral cortex is not well understood. We investigated age-related differences in both early visual and P300 components, and how individual differences in these components related to cortical structure in a cross-sectional sample of participants 8-19 years (n=86). Participants completed a three-stimulus visual oddball task while high-density EEG was recorded. Cortical surface area and thickness were estimated from T1-weighthed MRI. Group-level blind source separation of the EEG data identified two P300-like components, a fronto-central P300 and a parietal P300, as well as a component reflecting N1 and P2. Differences in activity across age were found for the parietal P300, N1 and P2, with the parietal P300 showing stronger activity for older participants, while N1 and P2 were stronger for younger participants. Stronger P300 components were positively associated with task performance, independently of age, while negative associations were found for P2 strength. Parietal P300 strength was age-independently associated with larger surface area in a region in left lateral inferior temporal cortex. We suggest that the age differences in component strength reflect development of attentional mechanisms, with increased brain responses to task-relevant stimuli representing an increasing ability to focus on relevant information and to respond accurately and efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Accurate population models are needed to build very large scale neural models, but their derivation is difficult for realistic networks of neurons, in particular when nonlinear properties are involved such as conductance-based interactions and spike-frequency adaptation. Here, we consider such models based on networks of Adaptive exponential Integrate and fire excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Using a Master Equation formalism, we derive a mean-field model of such networks and compare it to the full network dynamics. The mean-field model is capable to correctly predict the average spontaneous activity levels in asynchronous irregular regimes similar to in vivo activity. It also captures the transient temporal response of the network to complex external inputs. Finally, the mean-field model is also able to quantitatively describe regimes where high and low activity states alternate (UP-DOWN state dynamics), leading to slow oscillations. We conclude that such mean-field models are \\\"biologically realistic\\\" in the sense that they can capture both spontaneous and evoked activity, and they naturally appear as candidates to build very large scale models involving multiple brain areas.",

    "abstract": "The vertebrate eye originates from the eyefield, a domain of cells specified by a small number of transcription factors. In this study, we show that Tcf7la is one such transcription factor that acts cell-autonomously to specify the eye field in zebrafish. Despite the much reduced eyefield in tcf7l1a mutants, these fish develop normal eyes revealing a striking ability of the eye to recover from a severe early phenotype. This robustness is not mediated through compensation by paralogous genes; instead, the smaller optic vesicle of tcf7l1a mutants shows delayed neurogenesis and continues to grow until it achieves approximately normal size. Although the developing eye is robust to the lack of Tcf7l1a function, it is sensitised to the effects of additional mutations. In support of this, a forward genetic screen identified mutations in hesx1, cct5 and gdf6a, which give synthetically enhanced eye specification or growth phenotypes when in combination with the tcf7l1a mutation.",

Despite a common evolutionary origin and developmental role, the oosome is morphologically quite distinct from polar granules. It is a solid sphere that migrates within the cytoplasm before budding out and forming pole cells.\\n\\nResultsTo gain an understanding of both the molecular basis of the novel form of the oosome, and the conserved essential features of germ plasm, we quantified and compared transcript levels between embryo fragments that contained the oosome, and those that did not. The identity of the localized transcripts indicated that Nasonia uses different molecules to carry out conserved germ plasm functions. In addition, functional testing of a sample of localized transcripts revealed potentially novel mechanisms of ribonucleoprotein assembly and pole cell cellularization in the wasp.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate that numerous novel and unexpected molecules have been recruited in order produce the unique characteristics of the oosome and pole cell formation in Nasonia. This work will serve as the basis for further investigation into the patterns of germline determinant evolution among insects, the molecular basis of extreme morphology of ribonucleoproteins, and the incorporation of novel components into developmental networks.",

    "abstract": "Environmental or genetic perturbations lead to gene expression changes. While most analyses of these changes emphasize the presence of qualitative differences on just a few genes, we now know that changes are widespread. This large-scale variation has been linked to the exclusive influence of a global transcriptional program determined by the new physiological state of the cell. However, given the sophistication of eukaryotic regulation, we expect to have a complex architecture of specific control affecting this program. Here, we examine this architecture. Using data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression in different nutrient conditions, we first propose a five-sector genome partition, which integrates earlier models of resource allocation, as a framework to examine the deviations from the global control. In this scheme, we recognize invariant genes, whose regulation is dominated by physiology, specific genes, which substantially depart from it, and two additional classes that contain the frequently assumed growth-dependent genes. Whereas the invariant class shows a considerable absence of specific regulation, the rest is enriched by regulation at the level of transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic modulators. We nevertheless find markedly different strategies in how these classes deviate. On the one hand, there are TFs that act in a unique way between partition constituents, and on the other, the action of chromatin modifiers is significantly diverse. The balance between regulatory strategies ultimately modulates the action of the general transcription machinery and therefore limits the possibility of establishing a unifying program of expression change at a genomic scale.",

    "abstract": "The Arg/N-end rule pathway, a mechanism of protein degradation conserved from yeast to humans, is involved in cellular protein quality control, but its role has only been vaguely understood. Through systematic examination of single residue mutants of model misfolded substrates, and global analyses of yeast proteins, we discovered that Ubr1, an E3 ligase of the Arg/N-end rule, degrades organellar proteins that fail to reach their intended subcellular compartments. We determined that recognition by Ubr1 is dependent on location signals that are naturally embedded into the 2nd amino acid residue of the majority of proteins. The N-end rule pathway is thus likely to have been critical to the evolution of endosymbiotic relationships which paved the way for advanced eukaryotic cellular life.\n\nSignificance StatementThis work elucidates a novel role for the N-end Rule Pathway, a protein degradation pathway highly conserved from yeast to humans. We demonstrate that the N-end rule pathway enforces the cellular compartmentalization of ER and mitochondrial proteins by degrading them when they fail to successfully translocate into their intended destinations and thus become mislocalized to the cytosol. This mechanism prevents the accumulation of toxic foreign proteins within the cytosol. Recognition of the displaced proteins is dependent on cellular location signals programmed into the 2nd residue of the target proteins, as well as the tendency for the proteins to misfold in a foreign environment. These findings have significant relevance to research on the mechanisms causing human diseases involving protein misfolding.",

Here we offer evidence, obtained from Drosophila, that UPF1 constantly moves between the nucleus and cytoplasm and that it has multiple functions in the nucleus. It is associated, genome-wide, with nascent RNAs at most of the active Pol II transcription sites and at some Pol III-transcribed genes, as demonstrated microscopically on the polytene chromosomes of salivary gland and by ChIP-seq analysis in S2 cells. Intron recognition seems to interfere with association and translocation of UPF1 on nascent pre-mRNA transcripts, and cells depleted of UPF1 show defects in several nuclear processes essential to correct gene expression - most strikingly, the release of mRNAs from transcription sites and mRNA export from the nucleus.",

    "abstract": "In this work we demonstrate how to leverage our recent iterative deep learning-all atom molecular dynamics (MD) technique \\\"Reweighted autoencoded variational Bayes for enhanced sampling (RAVE)\\\" (Ribeiro, Bravo, Wang, Tiwary, J. Chem. Phys. 149, 072301 (2018)) for sampling protein-ligand unbinding mechanisms and calculating absolute binding affinities when plagued with difficult to sample rare events. RAVE iterates between rounds of MD and deep learning, and unlike other enhanced sampling methods, it stands out in simultaneously learning both a low-dimensional physically interpretable reaction coordinate (RC) and associated free energy. Here, we introduce a simple but powerful extension to RAVE which allows learning a position-dependent RC expressed as a superposition of piecewise linear RCs valid in different metastable states. With this approach, we retain the original physical interpretability of a RAVE-derived RC while making it applicable to a wider range of complex systems. We demonstrate how in its multi-dimensional form introduced here, RAVE can efficiently simulate the unbinding of the tightly bound benzene-lysozyme (L99A variant) complex, in all atom-precision and with minimal use of human intuition except for the choice of a larger dictionary of order parameters. These simulations had a 100 % success rate, and took between 3-50 nanoseconds for a process that takes on an average close to few hundred milliseconds, thereby reflecting a seven order of magnitude acceleration relative to straightforward MD. Furthermore, without any time-dependent biasing, the trajectories display clear back-and- forth movement between various metastable intermediates, demonstrating the reliability of the RC and its probability distribution learnt in RAVE. Our binding free energy is in good agreement with other reported simulation results. We thus believe that RAVE, especially in its multi-dimensional variant introduced here, will be a useful tool for simulating the dissociation process of practical biophysical systems with rare events in an automated manner with minimal use of human intuition.",

    "abstract": "Stabilisation of the stalled replication fork is crucial to prevent excessive fork reversal or degradation, which can undermine genome integrity. The WRN protein is a human RecQ helicase that participates in the processing and recovery of perturbed replication forks. WRN is unique among the other human RecQ family members to possess exonuclease activity. However, the biological role of the WRN exonuclease is poorly defined, and little is known about an involvement in the response to perturbed replication. Recently, the WRN exonuclease has been linked to protection of stalled forks from MRE11-dependent degradation in response to clinically-relevant nanomolar doses of the Topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin. Alternative processing of perturbed forks has been associated to chemoresistance of BRCA-deficient cancer cells, thus, we used WRN exonuclease-deficiency as a model to investigate the fate of perturbed replication forks undergoing degradation, but in a BRCA wild-type condition. We find that, upon nanomolar doses of camptothecin, loss of WRN exonuclease stimulates fork inactivation and accumulation of parental gaps, which engages RAD51. Such alternative mechanism affects reinforcement of CHK1 phosphorylation and causes persistence of RAD51 during recovery from treatment. Notably, in WRN exonuclease-deficient cells, persistence of RAD51 correlates with elevated mitotic phosphorylation of MUS81 at Serine 87, which is essential to avoid accumulation of mitotic abnormalities. Altogether, these findings indicate that aberrant fork degradation, in the presence of a wild-type RAD51 axis, stimulates RAD51-mediated post-replicative repair and engagement of the MUS81 complex to limit genome instability and cell death.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYCorrect progression of the molecular machine copying the chromosomes is threatened by multiple causes that induce its delay or arrest. Once the replication machinery is arrested, the cell needs to stabilise it to prevent DNA damage. Many proteins contribute to this task and the Werners syndrome protein, WRN, is one of them.\\n\\nDefining what happens to replication machineries when they are blocked is highly relevant. Indeed, destabilised replication machineries may form upon treatment with anticancer drugs and influence the efficacy of some of them in specific genetic backgrounds. We used cells that lack one of the two enzymatic functions of WRN, the exonuclease activity, to investigate the fate of destabilised replication machineries. Our data show that they are handled by a repair pathway normally involved in fixing DNA breaks but, in this case, recruited to deal with regions of the genome that are left unreplicated after their destabilisation. This alternative mechanism involves a protein, RAD51, which tries to copy DNA from the sister chromosome. In so doing, however, RAD51 produces a lot of DNA interlinking that requires upregulation of a complex, called MUS81/EME1, which resolves this interlinking prior cell division and prevents accumulation of mitotic defects and cell death.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn Latin America (LA), there is a high incidence rate of breast cancer (BC) in premenopausal women, and the genomic features of these BC remain unknown. Here, we aim to characterize the molecular features of BC in young LA women within the framework of the PRECAMA study, a multicenter population-based case-control study on breast cancer in premenopausal women.\\n\\nMethodsPathological tumor tissues were collected from incident cases from four LA countries. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed centrally for ER, PR, HER2, Ki67, EGFR, CK5/6 and p53 protein markers. Targeted deep sequencing was done on genomic DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour tissues and their paired blood samples to screen for somatic mutations in eight genes frequently mutated in BC. A subset of samples was analyzed by exome sequencing to identify somatic mutational signatures.\\n\\nResultsThe majority of cases were positive for ER or PR (168/233; 72%) and there were 21% triple negative (TN) cases, mainly of basal type. Most tumors were positive for Ki67 (189/233; 81%). In 126 sequenced cases, TP53 and PIK3CA were the most frequently mutated genes (32.5% and 21.4%, respectively), followed by AKT1 (9.5%). TP53 mutations were more frequent in HER2-enriched and TN IHC subtypes, while PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations were more frequent in ER positive tumors, as expected. Interestingly, a higher proportion of G:C>T:A mutations was observed in TP53 gene in PRECAMA cases compared to TCGA and METABRIC breast cancer series (27% vs 14%). Exome-wide mutational patterns in 10 TN cases revealed alterations in signaling transduction pathways and major contributions of mutational signatures caused by altered DNA repair pathways.\\n\\nConclusionsThis pilot results on PRECAMA tumors gives a preview of the molecular features of premenopausal BC in LA. Although, the overall mutation burden was as expected from data in other populations, mutational patterns observed in TP53 and exome-wide suggested possible differences in mutagenic processes giving rise to these tumors compared to other populations. Further omics analyses of a larger number of cases in the near future will allow investigating relationships between these molecular features and risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Most motile flagella have an axoneme that contains nine outer microtubule doublets and a central pair (CP) of microtubules. The CP is thought to coordinate the flagellar beat and defects in CP projections are associated with loss of motility and human disease. In most cilia, the CP nucleate near a  basal plate at the distal end of the transition zone (TZ). Here, we show that the trypanosome TZ protein  basalin is essential for building the basal plate, and its loss is associated with inefficient recruitment of CP assembly factors to the TZ, loss of the CP and flagellum paralysis. Guided by synteny, we identified highly divergent basalin orthologs in the genomes of related Leishmania species. Basalins are predicted to be highly unstructured, suggesting that they may act as  hubs facilitating many protein-protein interactions. This raises the general concept that proteins involved in cytoskeletal functions and apparently appearing organism-specific, may have highly divergent and cryptic orthologs in other species.",

    "abstract": "Notch signaling plays a key role in many cell fate decisions during development by directing different gene expression programs via the transcription factor CSL, known as Su(H) in Drosophila. Which target genes are responsive to Notch signaling is influenced by the chromatin state of enhancers, yet how this is regulated is not fully known. Detecting an increase in the histone variant H3.3 in response to Notch signaling, we tested which chromatin remodelers or histone chaperones were required for the changes in enhancer accessibility to Su(H) binding. This revealed a crucial role for the Brahma SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex in conferring enhancer accessibility and enabling the transcriptional response. The Notch-responsive regions had high levels of nucleosome turnover which were dependent on the Brahma complex, increased with Notch signaling and primarily involved histone H3.3. Together these results highlight the importance of SWI/SNF-mediated nucleosome turnover in rendering enhancers responsive to Notch.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular pathogens must egress from the host cell to continue their infectious cycle. Apicomplexans are a phylum of intracellular protozoans that have evolved members of the membrane attack complex and perforin (MACPF) family of pore forming proteins to disrupt cellular membranes for traversing cells during tissue migration or egress from a replicative vacuole following intracellular reproduction. Previous work showed that the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii secretes a perforin-like protein (TgPLP1) that contains a C-terminal Domain (CTD) which is necessary for efficient parasite egress. However, the structural basis for CTD membrane binding and egress competency remained unknown. Here, we present evidence that TgPLP1 CTD prefers binding lipids that are abundant in the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer. Additionally, solving the high-resolution crystal structure of the TgPLP1 APC{beta} domain within the CTD reveals an unusual double-layered {beta}-prism fold that resembles only one other protein of known structure. Three direct repeat sequences comprise subdomains, with each constituting a wall of the {beta}-prism fold. One subdomain features a protruding hydrophobic loop with an exposed tryptophan at its tip. Spectrophotometric measurements of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence are consistent with insertion of the hydrophobic loop into a target membrane. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing we show that parasite strains bearing mutations in the hydrophobic loop, including alanine substitution of the tip tryptophan, are equally deficient in egress as a strain lacking TgPLP1 altogether. Taken together our findings suggest a crucial role for the hydrophobic loop in anchoring TgPLP1 to the membrane to support its cytolytic activity and egress function.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryToxoplasma gondii has a complex life cycle that involves active invasion of the host cell, the formation of a replicative compartment, and egress from the replicative niche. T. gondii encodes a pore-forming protein, TgPLP1, that contains a C-terminal domain that is crucial for efficient exit from both the parasite containing vacuole and the host cell. However, the mechanism by which TgPLP1 recognizes and binds to the appropriate membrane is unclear. Here we use a combination of biochemistry, structural biology, and parasitology to identify the a preference of TgPLP1 for specific lipids and show that a loop within the structure of the C-terminal domain inserts into the membrane and is necessary for egress from the parasite containing vacuole. Our study sheds light into the determinants of membrane binding in TgPLP1 which may inform the overall mechanism of pore formation in similar systems",

To relieve this limitation, we developed a Minimal ProteOmic sample Preparation (mPOP) method for culture-grown mammalian cells. mPOP obviates cleanup and thus eliminates cleanup-related losses while expediting sample preparation and simplifying its automation. Bulk SILAC samples processed by mPOP or by conventional urea-based methods indicated that mPOP results in complete cell lysis and accurate relative quantification. We integrated mPOP lysis with the Single Cell ProtEomics by Mass Spectrometry (SCoPE-MS) sample preparation, and benchmarked the quantification of such samples on a Q-exactive instrument. The results demonstrate low noise and high technical reproducibility. Then, we FACS sorted single U-937, HEK-293, and mouse ES cells into 96-well plates and analyzed them by automated mPOP and SCoPE-MS.

    "abstract": "Mathematical models have been used successfully at diverse scales of biological organization, ranging from ecology and population dynamics to stochastic reaction events occurring between individual molecules in single cells. Generally, many biological processes unfold across multiple scales, with mutations being the best studied example of how stochasticity at the molecular scale can influence outcomes at the population scale. In many other contexts, however, an analogous link between micro- and macro-scale remains elusive, primarily due to the challenges involved in setting up and analyzing multi-scale models. Here, we employ such a model to investigate how stochasticity propagates from individual biochemical reaction events in the bacterial innate immune system to the ecology of bacteria and bacterial viruses. We show analytically how the dynamics of bacterial populations are shaped by the activities of immunity-conferring enzymes in single cells and how the ecological consequences imply optimal bacterial defense strategies against viruses. Our results suggest that bacterial populations in the presence of viruses can either optimize their initial growth rate or their steady state population size, with the first strategy favoring simple and the second strategy favoring complex bacterial innate immunity.",

    "abstract": "Cnidarians such as reef-building corals depend upon nutrient transfer from intracellular symbionts, but the mechanisms and evolution of this process remain unknown. Homologues of the conserved cholesterol binder Niemann-Pick Type C2 (NPC2) in cnidarians are implicated in the transfer of sterol from symbionts. Here, we show that symbionts transfer bulk sterols to the host, host sterol utilization is plastic, and pharmacological inhibition of sterol trafficking disrupts symbiosis. Having undergone an anthozoan-specific expansion, \\\"non-canonical\\\" NPC2s respond to symbiosis and accumulate over time at the lysosomal-like organelle in which the symbiont resides (\\\"symbiosome\\\"). We demonstrate that both a non- and canonical Aiptasia NPC2 bind symbiont-produced sterols, yet only the non-canonical homologue exhibits increased stability at low pH. We propose that symbiotic cnidarians adapted pre-existing cholesterol-trafficking machinery to function in the highly acidic symbiosome environment, allowing corals to dominate nutrient-poor shallow tropical seas worldwide.",

    "abstract": "The role of actomyosin contractility at epithelial adherens junctions has been extensively studied. However, little is known about how external forces are integrated to establish epithelial cell and organ shape in vivo. We use the Drosophila follicle epithelium to investigate how tension at adherens junctions is regulated to integrate external forces arising from changes in germline size and shape. We find that overall tension in the epithelium decreases despite pronounced growth of enclosed germline cells, suggesting that the epithelium relaxes to accommodate growth. However, we find local differences in adherens junction tension correlate with apposition to germline nurse cells or the oocyte. We demonstrate that medial Myosin II coupled to corrugating adherens junctions resists nurse cell-derived forces and thus maintains apical surface areas and cuboidal cell shapes. Furthermore, medial reinforcement of the apical surface ensures cuboidal-to-columnar cell shape transitions and imposes circumferential constraints on nurse cells guiding organ elongation. Our study provides insight into how tension within an adherens junction network integrates growth of a neighbouring tissue, mediates cell shape transitions and channels growth into organ elongation.",

These optogenetically transformed photoreceptors were light responsive and their transplantation lead to the recovery of visual function, as shown by ganglion cell recordings and behavioral tests.

After transplantation into blind mice, we observed light-driven responses at the photoreceptor and ganglion cell level.

    "abstract": "AbstractHemagglutinin (HA) stalk-reactive antibodies are the basis of several current \\\"one-shot\\\" universal influenza vaccine efforts because they protect against a wide spectrum of influenza virus strains. The appreciated mechanism of protection by HA-stalk antibodies is to inhibit HA stalk reconfiguration, blocking viral fusion and entry. This study shows that HA stalk-reactive antibodies also inhibit neuraminidase (NA) enzymatic activity, prohibiting viral egress. NA inhibition (NI) is evident for an attached substrate but not for unattached small molecule cleavage of sialic acid. This suggests that the antibodies inhibit NA enzymatic activity through steric hindrance, thus limiting NA access to sialic acids when adjacent to HA on whole virions. Consistently, F(ab)2 fragments that occupy reduced area without loss of avidity or disrupted HA/NA interactions show significantly reduced NI activity. Notably, HA stalk binding antibodies lacking NI activity were unable to neutralize viral infection via microneutralization assays. This work suggests that NI activity is an important component of HA-stalk antibody mediated protection.\\n\\nSummaryThis study reports a new mechanism of protection that is mediated by influenza hemagglutinin-stalk reactive antibodies: inhibition of neuraminidase activity by steric hindrance, blocking access of neuraminidase to sialic acids when it is abutted next to hemagglutinin on whole virions.",

    "abstract": "The Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) causes tuberculosis (TB) in humans and various other mammals. The human-adapted members of the MTBC comprise seven phylogenetic lineages that differ in their geographical distribution. There is growing evidence that this phylogenetic diversity modulates the outcome of TB infection and disease. For decades, TB research and development has focused on the two canonical MTBC reference strains H37Rv and Erdman, both of which belong to Lineage 4. Relying on only a few laboratory-adapted strains can be misleading as study results might not be directly transferrable to clinical settings where patients are infected with a diverse array of strains, including drug-resistant variants. Here, we argue for the need to expand TB research and development by incorporating the phylogenetic diversity of the MTBC. To facilitate such work, we have assembled a group of 20 genetically well-characterized clinical strains representing the seven known human-adapted MTBC lineages. With the \\\"MTBC clinical strains reference set\\\" we aim to provide a standardized resource for the TB community. We hope it will enable more direct comparisons between studies that explore the physiology of MTBC beyond the lab strains used thus far. We anticipate that detailed phenotypic analyses of this reference strain set will increase our understanding of TB biology and assist in the development of new control tools that are universally effective.",

    "abstract": "Biodiesel is a renewable substitute, or extender, for petroleum diesel that is composed of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) derived from plant and animal fats. Ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) blended with up to 20% FAME can be used interchangeably with ULSD, is compatible with existing infrastructure, but is also more susceptible to biodegradation. Microbial proliferation and fuel degradation in biodiesel blends has not been directly linked in situ to microbiologically influenced corrosion. We, therefore, conducted a yearlong study of B20 storage tanks in operation at two locations, identified the microorganisms responsible for observed fuel fouling and degradation, and measured in situ corrosion. The bacterial populations were more diverse than the fungal populations, and largely unique to each location. The bacterial populations included members of the Acetobacteraceae, Clostridiaceae, and Proteobacteria. The abundant Eukaryotes at both locations consisted of the same taxa, including a filamentous fungus within the family Trichocomaceae, and the Saccharomycetaceae family of yeasts. Increases in the absolute and relative abundances of the Trichocomaceae were correlated with significant, visible fouling and pitting corrosion. This study identified the relationship between recurrent fouling of B20 with increased rates of corrosion, largely at the bottom of the sampled storage tanks.",

Here, we show that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mediates AT remodeling, in particular, AT browning and inflammatory response in mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC). LLC tumor-bearing (TB) TLR4-/- mice were spared from AT remodeling due to a reduced macrophage infiltration and adipocyte atrophy. TLR4-/- mice were also resistant to cold-induced browning of subcutaneous AT (scAT). Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 reproduced the main protective effect against AT remodeling found in TLR4-/- TB mice. Moreover, the treatment was effective in prolonging the survival and attenuating tumor mass growth when compared to non-treated-TB animals. Further, tumor-induced elevation of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines was similarly abolished in both genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of TLR4.

We show here that expression of Dsg3 may directly influence p53, a key transcription factor governing the response to cellular stress. Dsg3 depletion caused increased p53 and apoptosis, an effect that was further enhanced by UV and mechanical strain and reversed by Dsg3 gain-of-function studies. Analysis in Dsg3-/- mouse skin confirmed increased p53/p21/caspase-3 compared to Dsg3+/- control in vivo. This Dsg3-p53 pathway involved YAP since Dsg3 forms a complex with YAP and regulates its expression and localization. Analysis of PV patient samples detected increased p53/YAP with diffuse cytoplasmic and/or nuclear staining in cells surrounding blisters. Treatment of keratinocytes with PV sera evoked pronounced p53/YAP expression. Collectively, our findings establish a novel role for Dsg3 as an anti-stress protein, via suppression of p53 function, suggesting that this pathway, involving YAP-Hippo control of skin homeostasis, is disrupted in PV.",

Our approach organizes co-eluting MS1 features into a single peak group and then identifies in-source fragments among co-eluting features using MS/MS spectral libraries. We tested our approach using previously published data of verified metabolites, and compared the results to features detected by other mainstream metabolomics tools.

Theoretical considerations and computer simulations suggest that emergence of genetic parasites is intrinsic to evolving replicator systems.\\n\\nResultsUsing methods of bifurcation analysis, we investigated the stability of simple models of replicator-parasite coevolution in a well-mixed environment. It is shown that the simplest imaginable system of this type, one in which the parasite evolves during the replication of the host genome through a minimal mutation that renders the genome of the emerging parasite incapable of producing the replicase but able to recognize and recruit it for its own replication, is unstable. In this model, there are only either trivial or \\\"semi-trivial\\\", parasite-free equilibria: an inefficient parasite is outcompeted by the host and dies off whereas an efficient one pushes the host out of existence, which leads to the collapse of the entire system. We show that stable host-parasite coevolution (a non-trivial equilibrium) is possible in a modified model where the parasite is qualitatively distinct from the host replicator in that the replication of the parasite depends solely on the availability of the host but not on the carrying capacity of the environment.\\n\\nConclusionsWe analytically determine the conditions for stable host-parasite coevolution in simple mathematical models and find that a parasite that initially evolves from the host through the loss of the ability to replicate autonomously must be substantially derived for a stable host-parasite coevolution regime to be established.",

    "abstract": "Arthropods are often infected with Wolbachia inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), whereby crosses between uninfected females and infected males yield unviable fertilized offspring. Although uninfected females benefit from avoiding mating with Wolbachia-infected males, this behaviour is not present in all host species. Here we measured the prevalence of this behaviour across populations of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae. Females from five populations originally fully infected with Wolbachia showed no preference, possibly because they did not face the choice between compatible and incompatible mates in their environment. Hence, to determine whether this behaviour could be selected in populations with intermediate Wolbachia infection frequency, we performed 15 generations of experimental evolution of spider-mite populations under i) full Wolbachia infection, ii) no infection, or iii) mixed infection. In the latter selection regime, where uninfected females were exposed to infected and uninfected males at every generation, mating duration increased relative to the uninfected regime, suggesting the presence of genetic variation for mating traits. However, mate choice did not evolve. Together, these results show that CI-inducing Wolbachia alone does not necessarily lead to the evolution of pre-copulatory strategies in uninfected hosts, even at intermediate infection frequency.",

    "abstract": "Incidences of infection and occurrence of Kocuria rhizophila in human gut are prominent but certainly no reports on the species ability to withstand human gastrointestinal dynamics. Kocuria rhizophila strain D2 isolated from healthy human gut was comprehensively characterized. The functional analysis revealed the ability to produce various gastric enzymes and sensitive to major clinical antibiotics. It also exhibited tolerance to acidic pH and bile salts. Strain D2 displayed bile-salt hydrolytic (BSH) activity, strong cell surface traits such as hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation capacity and adherence to human HT-29 cell line. Prominently, it showed no hemolytic activity and was susceptible to the human serum. Exploration of the genome led to the discovery of the genes for the above said properties and has ability to produce various essential amino acids and vitamins. Further, comparative genomics have identified core, accessory and unique genetic features. The core genome has given insights into the phylogeny while the accessory and unique genes has led to the identification of niche specific genes. Bacteriophage, virulence factors and biofilm formation genes were absent with this species. Housing CRISPR and antibiotic resistance gene was strain specific. The integrated approach of functional, genomic and comparative analysis denotes the niche specific adaption to gut dynamics of strain D2. Moreover the study has comprehensively characterized genome sequence of each strain to know the genetic difference and intern recognize the effects of on phenotype and functionality complexity. The evolutionary relationship among strains along and adaptation strategies has been included in this study.\\n\\nSignificanceReports of Kocuria rhizophila isolation from various sources have been reported but the few disease outbreaks in humans and fishes have been prominent, but no supportive evidence about the survival ability of Kocuria spp. within human GIT.

Here we demonstrate that Cyanobacteria living in marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments produce methane at substantial rates under light and dark oxic and anoxic conditions, forming a link between light driven primary productivity and methane production in globally relevant group of phototrophs. Biogenic methane production was enhanced during oxygenic photosynthesis and directly attributed to the cyanobacteria by applying stable isotope labelling techniques. We suggest that formation of methane by Cyanobacteria may contribute to methane accumulation in oxygen-saturated surface waters of marine and freshwater ecosystems. Moreover, in these environments, cyanobacterial blooms already do, and might further occur more frequently during future global warming and thus have a direct feedback on climate change. We further highlight that cyanobacterial methane production not only affects recent and future global methane budgets, but also has implications for inferences on Earths methane budget for the last 3.5 billion years, when this phylum is thought to have first evolved.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnalysis of 16S rRNA marker-gene surveys, used to characterize prokaryotic microbial communities, may be performed by numerous bioinformatic pipelines and downstream analysis methods. However, there is limited guidance on how to decide between methods, appropriate data sets and statistics for assessing these methods are needed. We developed a mixture dataset with real data complexity and an expected value for assessing 16S rRNA bioinformatic pipelines and downstream analysis methods. We generate an assessment dataset using a two-sample titration mixture design. The sequencing data were processed using multiple bioinformatic pipelines, i) DADA2 a sequence inference method, ii) Mothur a de novo clustering method, and iii) QIIME with open-reference clustering. The mixture dataset was used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess count tables generated using the pipelines.\\n\\nResultsThe qualitative assessment was used to evalute features only present in unmixed samples and titrations. The abundance of Mothur and QIIME features specific to unmixed samples and titrations were explained by sampling alone. However, for DADA2 over a third of the unmixed sample and titration specific feature abundance could not be explained by sampling alone. The quantitative assessment evaluated pipeline performance by comparing observed to expected relative and differential abundance values. Overall the observed relative abundance and differential abundance values were consistent with the expected values. Though outlier features were observed across all pipelines.\\n\\nConclusionsUsing a novel mixture dataset and assessment methods we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated count tables generated using three bioinformatic pipelines. The dataset and methods developed for this study will serve as a valuable community resource for assessing 16S rRNA marker-gene survey bioinformatic methods.",

    "abstract": "SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWThis paper presents a model-based method for clustering multivariate binary observations that incorporates constraints consistent with the scientific context. The approach is motivated by the precision medicine problem of identifying autoimmune disease patient subsets or classes who may require different treatments. We start with a family of restricted latent class models or RLCMs (e.g., Xu and Shang, 2018). However, in the motivating example and many others like it, the unknown number of classes and the definition of classes using binary states are among the targets of inference. We use a Bayesian approach to RCLMs in order to use informative prior assumptions on the number and definitions of latent classes to be consistent with scientific knowledge so that the posterior distribution tends to concentrate on smaller numbers of clusters and sparser binary patterns. The paper derives a posterior sampling algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo with split-merge updates to efficiently explore the space of clustering allocations. Through simulations under the assumed model and realistic deviations from it, we demonstrate greater interpretability of results and superior finite-sample clustering performance for our method compared to common alternatives. The methods are illustrated with an analysis of protein data to detect clusters representing autoantibody classes among scleroderma patients.",

Copy number variants (CNVs) are however understudied, being more difficult to detect than single nucleotide polymorphisms. We take advantage of the intense selective pressures on the major malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, caused by the widespread use of insecticides for malaria control, to investigate the role of CNVs in the evolution of insecticide resistance.\\n\\nResultsUsing the whole-genome sequencing data from 1142 samples in the An. gambiae 1000 genomes project, we identified 1557 independent increases in copy number, encompassing a total of 267 genes, which were enriched for gene families linked to metabolic insecticide resistance. The five major candidate genes for metabolic resistance were all found in at least one CNV, and were often the target of multiple independent CNVs, reaching as many as 16 CNVs in Cyp9k1. These CNVs have furthermore been spreading due to positive selection, indicated by high local CNV frequencies and extended haplotype homozygosity.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate the importance of CNVs in the response to selection, with CNVs being closely associated with genes involved in the evolution of resistance to insecticides, highlighting the urgent need to identify their relative contributions to resistance and to track their spread as the application of insecticide in malaria endemic countries intensifies. Our detailed descriptions of CNVs found across the species range provides the tools to do so.",

    "abstract": "Many Pomona strains of the spirochete Leptospira interrogans express the osmotically-inducible sphingomyelinase gene, sph2, at much higher levels than non-Pomona strains. We developed a new green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter plasmid to examine sph2 gene expression determinants. The vector allows fusion of the test promoter to the ribosome-binding site and coding region of gfp. We fused the sph2 promoters from the serovar Lai strain 56601 and from the serovar Pomona strain LC82-25 to gfp to examine the molecular determinants of differential sph2 expression between the two strains. Similar to what is observed with the native sph2 genes, introduction of the plasmids into the Lai 56601 strain resulted in near background levels of gfp expression from the Lai sph2 promoter, while expression from the Pomona sph2 promoter was high. Expression from both fusions increased at physiologic levels of osmolarity achieved by addition of sodium chloride to the culture medium. We examined the role of a 17 bp upstream element found in all L. interrogans strains expressing low basal levels of sph2 and missing from Pomona strains that express sph2 at high levels. When the 17 bp sequence present upstream of the Lai sph2 promoter was deleted or scrambled, fusion expression increased substantially. Conversely, insertion of the 17 bp sequence upstream of the Pomona sph2 promoter diminished fusion expression. In contrast, removal of an insertion sequence-like element that is found only in the Pomona sph2 upstream sequence had no effect on expression from the Pomona sph2 fusion in the Lai strain. These findings demonstrate the utility of the gfp reporter plasmid in analyzing gene expression in L. interrogans.\\n\\nIMPORTANCE\\n\\nGenetic tools are needed to examine gene expression in the pathogen Leptospira interrogans. We developed a reporter plasmid that replicates in L. interrogans with green fluorescent protein (GFP) as the read out of promoter activity. We demonstrated an application of the new reporter plasmid by identifying an upstream element responsible for the poor basal expression of the sph2 sphingomyelinase gene in a serovar Lai strain of L. interrogans.

In this study, we investigated how frequency-specific brain dynamics relate to models of probabilistic language prediction during auditory narrative comprehension. We recorded MEG activity while participants were listening to auditory stories in Dutch. Using trigram statistical language models, we estimated for every word in a story its conditional probability of occurrence. On the basis of word probabilities, we computed how unexpected the current word is given its context (word perplexity) and how (un)predictable the current linguistic context is (word entropy). We then evaluated whether source-reconstructed MEG oscillations at different frequency bands are modulated as a function of these language processing metrics. We show that theta-band source dynamics are increased in high relative to low entropy states, likely reflecting lexical computations. Beta-band dynamics are increased in situations of low word entropy and perplexity possibly reflecting maintenance of ongoing cognitive context. These findings lend support to the idea that the brain engages in the active generation and evaluation of predicted language based on the statistical properties of the input signal.",

Numerous adaptations in the DYN/KOR system have also been identified in response to stress. However, whereas most studies examining the function of the DYN/KOR system have been conducted in adults, there is growing evidence suggesting that this system is ontogenetically regulated. Likewise, the outcome of exposure to stress also differs across ontogeny. Based on these developmental similarities, the objective of this study was to systematically test effects of a selective KOR agonist, U62066, on various aspects of social behavior across ontogeny in non-stressed male and female rats as well as in males and females with a prior history of repeated exposure to restraint (90 min/day, 5 exposures). We found that the social consequences of repeated restraint differed as a function of age: juvenile stress produced substantial increases in play fighting, whereas adolescent and adult stress resulted in decreases in social investigation and social preference. The KOR agonist U62066 dose-dependently reduced social behaviors in non-stressed adults, producing social avoidance at the highest dose tested, while younger animals displayed reduced sensitivity to this socially suppressing effect of U62066. Interestingly, in stressed animals, the socially suppressing effects of the KOR agonist were blunted at all ages, with juveniles and adolescents exhibiting increased social preference in response to certain doses of U62066. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that the DYN/KOR system changes with age and differentially responds and adapts to stress across development.",

    "abstract": "1Many biomolecular complexes exist in a flexible ensemble of states in solution which are necessary to perform their biological function. Small angle scattering (SAS) measurements are a popular method for characterizing these flexible molecules due to their relative ease of use and ability to simultaneously probe the full ensemble of states. However, SAS data is typically low-dimensional and difficult to interpret without the assistance of additional structural models. In theory, experimental SAS curves can be reconstituted from a linear combination of theoretical models, although this procedure carries significant risk of overfitting the inherently low-dimensional SAS data. Previously, we developed a Bayesian-based method for fitting ensembles of model structures to experimental SAS data that rigorously avoids overfitting. However, we have found that these methods can be difficult to incorporate into typical SAS modeling workflows, especially for users that are not experts in computational modeling. To this end, we present the \"Bayesian Ensemble Estimation from SAS\" (BEES) program. Two forks of BEES are available, the primary one existing as module for the SASSIE webserver and a developmental version that is a standalone python program. BEES allows users to exhaustively sample ensemble models constructed from a library of theoretical states and to interactively analyze and compare each models performance. The fitting routine also allows for secondary data sets to be supplied, thereby simultaneously fitting models to both SAS data as well as orthogonal information. The flexible ensemble of K63-linked ubiquitin trimers is presented as an example of BEES capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Changes in gene regulation have long been thought to play an important role in primate evolution. However, although a number of studies have compared genome-wide gene expression patterns across primate species, fewer have investigated the gene regulatory mechanisms that underlie such patterns, or the relative contribution of drift versus selection. Here, we profiled genome-scale DNA methylation levels from five of the six extant species of the baboon genus Papio (4-14 individuals per species). This radiation presents the opportunity to investigate DNA methylation divergence at both shallow and deeper time scales (380,000 - 1.4 million years). In contrast to studies in human populations, but similar to studies in great apes, DNA methylation profiles clearly mirror genetic and geographic structure. Divergence in DNA methylation proceeds fastest in unannotated regions of the genome and slowest in regions of the genome that are likely more constrained at the sequence level (e.g., gene exons). Both heuristic approaches and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models suggest that DNA methylation levels at a small set of sites have been affected by positive selection, and that this class is enriched in functionally relevant contexts, including promoters, enhancers, and CpG islands. Our results thus indicate that the rate and distribution of DNA methylation changes across the genome largely mirror genetic structure. However, at some CpG sites, DNA methylation levels themselves may have been a target of positive selection, pointing to loci that could be important in connecting sequence variation to fitness-related traits.",

    "abstract": "G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane receptors that signal through heterotrimeric G proteins. Lipid modifications anchor G proteins to the plasma membrane; however, little is known about the effect of phospholipid composition on GPCR-G protein coupling. The {beta}2 adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AR) signals through both Gs and Gi in cardiac myocytes where studies suggest that Gi signaling may be cardioprotective. However, Gi coupling is much less efficient than Gs coupling in most cell-based and biochemical assays, making it difficult to study {beta}2AR-Gi interactions. To investigate the role of phospholipid composition on Gs and Gi coupling, we reconstituted {beta}2AR in detergent/lipid mixed micelles and found that negatively charged phospholipids (PS and PG) inhibit {beta}2AR-Gi3 coupling. Replacing negatively charged lipids with neutral lipids (PC or PE) facilitated the formation of a functional {beta}2AR-Gi3 interaction that activated Gi3. Ca2+, known to interact with negatively charged PS, facilitated {beta}2AR-Gi3 interaction in PS. Mutational analysis suggested that Ca2+ interacts with the negatively charged EDGE motif on the carboxyl-terminal end of the N helix of Gi3 and coordinates an EDGE-PS interaction. These results were confirmed in {beta}2AR reconstituted into nanodisc phospholipid bilayers. {beta}2AR-Gi3 interaction was favored in neutral lipids (PE and PC) over negatively charged lipids (PG and PS). In contrast, basal {beta}2AR-Gs interaction was favored in negatively charged lipids over neutral lipids. In negatively-charged lipids, Ca2+ and Mg2+ facilitated {beta}2AR-Gi3 interaction. Taken together, our observations suggest that local membrane charge modulates the interaction between {beta}2AR and competing G protein subtypes.",

We created a high throughput assay to directly measure the edits generated by over 40,000 guide RNAs, and applied it in a range of genetic backgrounds and for alternative CRISPR/Cas9 reagents. In total, we gathered data for over 1,000,000,000 mutational outcomes in synthetic constructs, which mirror those at endogenous loci. The majority of reproducible mutations are insertions of a single base, short deletions, or long microhomology-mediated deletions. gRNAs have a cell-line dependent preference for particular outcomes, especially favouring single base insertions and microhomology-mediated deletions. We uncover sequence determinants of the produced mutations at individual loci, and use these to derive a predictor of Cas9 editing outcomes with accuracy close to the theoretical maximum. This improved understanding of sequence repair allows better design of editing experiments, and may lead to future therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Electron cryo-microscopy analyzes the structure of proteins and protein complexes in vitrified solution. Proteins tend to adsorb to the air-water interface in unsupported films of aqueous solution, which can result in partial or complete denaturation of the protein. We investigated the structure of yeast fatty acid synthase at the air-water interface by electron cryo-tomography and single-particle image processing. Around 90% of complexes adsorbed to the air-water interface are partly denatured. We show that the unfolded regions are those facing the air-water interface. Denaturation by contact with air may happen at any stage of specimen preparation. Denaturation at the air-water interface is completely avoided when the complex is plunge-frozen on a substrate of hydrophilized graphene.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional induction of Heat Shock Protein (HSP) genes in yeast is accompanied by dynamic changes in their 3D structure and spatial organization, yet the molecular basis for these phenomena remains unknown. Using chromosome conformation capture and single cell imaging, we show that genes transcriptionally activated by Heat Shock Factor 1 (Hsf1) specifically interact across chromosomes and coalesce into diffraction-limited intranuclear foci. Genes activated by the alternative stress regulators Msn2 and Msn4, in contrast, do not interact among themselves nor with Hsf1 targets. Likewise, constitutively expressed genes, even those interposed between HSP genes, show no detectable interaction. Hsf1 forms discrete subnuclear puncta when stress-activated, and these puncta dissolve in concert with transcriptional attenuation, paralleling the kinetics of HSP gene coalescence and dissolution. Nuclear Hsf1 and RNA Pol II are both necessary for intergenic HSP gene interactions, while DNA-bound Hsf1 is necessary and sufficient to drive coalescence of a heterologous gene. Our findings demonstrate that Hsf1 can dynamically restructure the yeast genome.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced hemorrhagic cystitis is characterized by bladder pain and voiding dysfunction caused by hemorrhage and inflammation. Of currently available therapies, prophylactic 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESNA) has limited efficacy and cannot treat pre-existing lesions. Therefore, novel therapeutic options to treat hemorrhagic cystitis are needed. We previously reported that systemic administration of the Schistosomiasis haematobium-derived protein H-IPSEH06 (IL-4-inducing principle from Schistosoma mansoni eggs), is superior to 3 doses of MESNA in alleviating hemorrhagic cystitis. Based on prior reports by others on S. mansoni IPSE and additional work by our group, we reasoned that H-IPSEH06 mediates its effects on hemorrhagic cystitis by binding IgE on basophils and inducing IL-4 expression, promoting urothelial proliferation, and translocating to the nucleus to modulate expression of genes implicated in relieving bladder dysfunction. We speculated that local bladder injection of the S. haematobium IPSE ortholog IPSEH03, hereafter called H-IPSEH03, might be more efficacious in preventing hemorrhagic cystitis compared to systemic administration of IPSEH06. We demonstrate herein that H-IPSEH03 is a promising therapeutic for the treatment of voiding dysfunction and bladder pain in hemorrhagic cystitis. Namely, it attenuates ifosfamide-induced increases in bladder wet weight in an IL-4-dependent fashion. H-IPSEH03 relieves hemorrhagic cystitis-associated allodynia. Finally, H-IPSEH03 drives increased urothelial cell proliferation. This indicates that IPSE induces bladder healing mechanisms, which suggests that it may be a novel non-opioid analgesic to treat bladder pain syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli is a major cause of bloodstream and urinary tract infections globally. The wide dissemination of multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains of extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) poses a rapidly increasing public health burden due to narrowed treatment options and increased risk of failure to clear an infection. Here, we present a detailed population genomic analysis of the ExPEC ST131 clone, in which we seek explanations for its success as an emerging pathogenic strain beyond the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. We show evidence for evolution towards separate ecological niches for the main clades of ST131 and differential evolution of anaerobic metabolism, key colonisation and virulence factors. We further demonstrate that negative frequency-dependent selection acting across accessory loci is a major mechanism that has shaped the population evolution of this pathogen.",
