    "abstract": "PCA is frequently used to display and discover patterns in SNP data from humans, animals, plants, and microbes--especially to elucidate population structure. Given the popularity of PCA, one might expect that PCA is understood well and applied effectively. However, our literature survey of 125 representative articles that apply PCA to SNP data shows that three choices have usually been made poorly: SNP coding, PCA variant, and PCA graph. Accordingly, we offer several simple recommendations for effective PCA analysis of SNP data. The ultimate benefit from informed and optimal choices of SNP coding, PCA variant, and PCA graph is expected to be discovery of more biology, and thereby acceleration of medical, agricultural, and other vital applications.",

    "abstract": "SummaryOne of the key knowledge gaps blocking development of effective therapeutics for Alzheimers disease (AD) is the lack of understanding of how amyloid beta (A{beta}) and tau cooperate in causing disease phenotypes. Within a mouse tau deficient background, we probed the molecular, cellular and behavioural disruption triggered by wild-type human taus influence on human A{beta}-induced pathology. We find that A{beta} and tau work cooperatively to cause a hyperactivity phenotype and to cause downregulation of gene transcription including many involved in synaptic function. In both our mouse model and in human post-mortem tissue, we observe accumulation of pathological tau in synapses, supporting the potential importance of synaptic tau. Importantly, tau depletion in the mice, initiated after behavioural deficits emerge, was found to correct behavioural deficits, reduce synaptic tau levels, and substantially reverse transcriptional perturbations, suggesting that lowering tau levels, particularly at the synapse, may be beneficial in AD.\\n\\nHighlights- Expression of human familial Alzheimers associated mutant amyloid precursor protein and presenillin 1 with wild-type human tau in the absence of endogenous tau in a novel MAPT-AD mouse model results in behavioural deficits and downregulation of genes involved in synaptic function.\\n- Tau is present in pre and postsynaptic terminals in MAPT-AD mice and human AD brain. In mice, lowering synaptic tau levels was associated with improved cognition and recovered gene expression.\\n- These data suggest that A{beta} and tau act cooperatively in impairing synaptic function and that lowering tau at synapses could be a beneficial therapeutic approach in AD.",

    "abstract": "ARGONAUTES are the central effector proteins of RNA silencing which bind target transcripts in a small RNA-guided manner. Arabidopsis thaliana has ten ARGONAUTE (AGO) genes, with specialized roles in RNA-directed DNA methylation, post-transcriptional gene silencing, and antiviral defense. To better understand specialization among AGO genes at the level of transcriptional regulation we tested a library of 1497 transcription factors for binding to the promoters of AGO1, AGO10, and AGO7 using yeast 1-hybrid assays. A ranked list of candidate DNA-binding TFs revealed binding of the AGO7 promoter by a number of proteins in two families: the miR156-regulated SPL family and the miR319-regulated TCP family, both of which have roles in developmental timing and leaf morphology. Possible functions for SPL and TCP binding are unclear: we showed that these binding sites are not required for the polar expression pattern of AGO7, nor for the function of AGO7 in leaf shape. Normal AGO7 transcription levels and function appear to depend instead on an adjacent 124-bp region. Progress in understanding the structure of this promoter may aid efforts to understand how the conserved AGO7-triggered TAS3 pathway functions in timing and polarity.",

    "abstract": "PurposeRadiation therapy (RT) is a common treatment for head and neck (HaN) cancer where therapists are often required to manually delineate boundaries of the organs-at-risks (OARs). The radiation therapy planning is time-consuming as each computed tomography (CT) volumetric data set typically consists of hundreds to thousands of slices and needs to be individually inspected. Automated head and neck anatomical segmentation provides a way to speed up and improve the reproducibility of radiation therapy planning. Previous work on anatomical segmentation is primarily based on atlas registrations, which takes up to hours for one patient and requires sophisticated atlas creation. In this work, we propose the AnatomyNet, an end-to-end and atlas-free three dimensional squeeze-and-excitation U-Net (3D SE U-Net), for fast and fully automated whole-volume HaN anatomical segmentation.\\n\\nMethodsThere are two main challenges for fully automated HaN OARs segmentation: 1) challenge in segmenting small anatomies (i.e., optic chiasm and optic nerves) occupying only a few slices, and 2) training model with inconsistent data annotations with missing ground truth for some anatomical structures because of different RT planning. We propose the AnatomyNet that has one down-sampling layer with the trade-off between GPU memory and feature representation capacity, and 3D SE residual blocks for effective feature learning to alleviate these challenges. Moreover, we design a hybrid loss function with the Dice loss and the focal loss. The Dice loss is a class level distribution loss that depends less on the number of voxels in the anatomy, and the focal loss is designed to deal with highly unbalanced segmentation. For missing annotations, we propose masked loss and weighted loss for accurate and balanced weights updating in the learning of the AnatomyNet.\\n\\nResultsWe collect 261 HaN CT images to train the AnatomyNet, and use MICCAI Head and Neck Auto Segmentation Challenge 2015 as the benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of the AnatomyNet. The objective is to segment nine anatomies: brain stem, chiasm, mandible, optic nerve left, optic nerve right, parotid gland left, parotid gland right, submandibular gland left, and submandibular gland right. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods for each anatomy from the MICCAI 2015 competition, the AnatomyNet increases Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) by 3.3% on average. The proposed AnatomyNet takes only 0.12 seconds on average to segment a whole-volume HaN CT image of an average dimension of 178 x 302 x 225. All the data and code will be availablea.\\n\\nConclusion1We propose an end-to-end, fast and fully automated deep convolutional network, AnatomyNet, for accurate and whole-volume HaN anatomical segmentation. The proposed Anato-myNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and good generalization ability of the components in the AnatomyNet.",

    "abstract": "Achilles tendinopathy is ten-times more common amongst running athletes compared to age-matched peers. Load induced tendon remodeling and its progression in an at-risk population of developing symptomatic tendinopathy is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to prospectively characterize Achilles and patellar tendon structure in competitive collegiate distance runners over different competitive seasons using quantitative ultrasound imaging. Twenty-two collegiate cross country runners and eleven controls were examined for this study. Longitudinal and cross-sectional ultrasound images of bilateral Achilles and patellar tendons were obtained at the one week prior to start of formal collegiate cross country practices, one week after the conclusion of cross country season, and one week prior to outdoor track and field championships. Collagen organization, mean echogenicity, tendon thickness, and neovascularity were determined using well established image processing techniques. We found that Achilles and patellar tendons respond differently to high-volume running and transitions from one sport season to another, suggesting that tendon structure is sensitive to differences in tendon loading biomechanics. Our findings indicate that Achilles tendon structure in trained runners differ structurally to control tendons but is stable throughout training while patellar tendon structure changes in response to the transition in training volume between cross country and track seasons. These findings expand upon prior reports that some degree of tendon remodeling may act as a protective adaptation for sport specific loading.\\n\\nNews and NoteworthyIn this study we prospectively examined the Achilles and patellar tendon structure of distance runners to determine if continued training through multiple seasons elicits tendon remodeling or pathology. We found that Achilles and patellar tendons respond uniquely to the changing loads required during each season. Achilles tendon collagen alignment is mostly stable throughout the competitive cycle, but the patellar tendon undergoes structural changes following the transition from cross-country to track season.",

    "abstract": "Much evidence suggests that the angular gyrus (AnG) is involved in episodic memory, but its precise role is yet to be determined. We examined two possible accounts, within the same experimental paradigm: the CoBRA account (Shimamura, 2011), which suggests that the AnG acts as a convergence zone that binds multimodal episodic features; and the Subjectivity account (Yazar et al., 2012), which implicates AnG involvement in subjective mnemonic experience (such as vividness or confidence). fMRI was employed during both encoding and retrieval of paired-associates. During study, female and male human participants memorised picture-pairs of common objects (in the unimodal task) or of an object-picture and an environmental sound (in the crossmodal task). At test, they performed a cued-recall task, and further indicated the vividness of their memory. During retrieval, BOLD activation in the AnG was greatest for vividly remembered associates, consistent with the Subjectivity account. During encoding, the same effect of vividness was found, but this was further modulated by task: Greater activations were associated with subsequent recall in the crossmodal than the unimodal task. Thus, encoding data suggests an additional role to the AnG in cross-modal integration, consistent with its role at retrieval proposed by CoBRA. These results resolve some of the puzzles in the literature and indicate that the AnG can play different roles during encoding and retrieval, determined by the cognitive demands posed by different mnemonic tasks.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWe offer new insights into the multiplicity of processes that are associated with angular gyrus (AnG) activation during encoding and retrieval of newly formed memories. We used fMRI while human participants learned and subsequently recalled pairs of objects presented to the same sensory modality or to different modalities. We were able to show that the AnG is involved when vivid memories are created and retrieved, as well as when encoded information is integrated across different sensory modalities. These findings provide novel evidence for the contribution of the AnG to our subjective experience of remembering, alongside its role in integrative processes that promote subsequent memory.",

    "abstract": "Darwinian evolution consists of the gradual transformation of heritable quantitative traits due to natural selection and the input of random variation by mutation. Here, we use a quantitative genetics approach to investigate the coevolution of multiple traits under selection, mutation, and limited dispersal. We track the dynamics of trait means and variance-covariances between traits that experience frequency-dependent selection. Assuming a multivariate-normal trait distribution, we recover classical dynamics of quantitative genetics, as well as stability and evolutionary branching conditions of invasion analyses, except that due to limited dispersal, selection depends on indirect fitness effects and relatedness. In particular, correlational selection that associates different traits within-individuals depends on the fitness effects of such associations between-individuals. These kin selection effects can be as relevant as pleiotropy for correlation between traits. We illustrate this with an example of the coevolution of two social traits whose association within-individual is costly but synergistically beneficial between-individuals. As dispersal becomes limited and relatedness increases, associations between-traits between-individuals become increasingly targeted by correlational selection. Consequently, the trait distribution goes from being bimodal with a negative correlation under panmixia to unimodal with a positive correlation under limited dispersal. More broadly, our approach can help understand the evolution of intra-specific variation.",

To study the morphogenesis of such neurons, we examined the C. elegans amphid, in which dendrites protrude through a glial channel at the nose. During development, amphid dendrites extend by attaching to the nose via DYF-7, a type of protein typically found in epithelial apical ECM. Here, we show that amphid neurons and glia exhibit epithelial properties, including tight junctions and apical-basal polarity, and develop in a manner resembling other epithelia. We find that DYF-7 is a fibril-forming apical ECM component that prevents rupture of the tube-shaped glial channel, reminiscent of roles for apical ECM in other narrow epithelial tubes. We also identify a role for FRM-2, a homolog of EPBL15/moe/Yurt which promote epithelial integrity in other systems. Finally, we show that other environmentally-exposed neurons share a requirement for DYF-7. Together, our results suggest that these neurons and glia can be viewed as part of an epithelium continuous with the skin, and are shaped by mechanisms shared with other epithelia.",

Transcriptome analysis of two H.pylori strains and their respective MTase mutants showed that inactivation of the MTase led to changes in the expression of 225 genes in strain J99, and 29 genes in strain BCM-300.10 genes were differentially expressed in both mutated strains. Combining bioinformatic analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that motifs overlapping the promoter influence the expression of genes directly, while methylation of other motifs might cause secondary effects.Thus, m5C methylation modifies the transcription of multiple genes, affecting important phenotypic traits that include adherence to host cells, natural competence for DNA uptake, bacterial cell shape, and susceptibility to copper.",

Meanwhile, the functional state and posible clonal selection of CD8 cells in lupus remain poorly defined. We previously described the activated but non-pathogenic phenotype of CD8+ T cells, some of which accumulate in the brain, in a model of systemic autoimmune disease triggered by increased copy number of the tlr7 gene (TLR7tg mice). Here we report, through the analysis of TCR{beta} sequences, that CD8+ cells from TLR7tg are strongly selected for a small number of clones, some of them reaching 30% of the repertoire, compared to less than 0.4% for a single top clone in wild type cells. High frequency clones are variable in sequence among individual TLR7tg mice and are distinct from top clones in WT, while cells from spleen and brain-resident cells from the same animals have perfect concordance. These results suggest that top CD8 clones are selected in stochastic fashion in each animal but limit further diversification, and that brain infiltrating CD8 cells in TLR7tg are not selected by a tissue specific antigen. This kind of extreme clonal dominance and narrowing of the CD8+ T cell repertoire coud potentially impair anti-viral responses and should be considered as an additional detrimental feature of chronic autoimmune disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Peroxiredoxins (Prx) are a family of proteins that play a major role in antioxidant defense and peroxide-regulated signaling. Six distinct Prx subgroups have been defined based on analysis of structure and sequence regions in proximity to the Prx active site. Analysis of other sequence regions of these annotated proteins may improve the ability to distinguish subgroups and uncover additional representative sequence regions beyond the active site.\\n\\nResultsThe space of Prx subgroup classifiers is surveyed to highlight similarities and differences in the available approaches. Exploiting the recent growth in annotated Prx proteins, a whole sequence-based classifier is presented that employs support vector machines and a k-mer (k=3) sequence representation.\\n\\nDistinguishing k-mers are extracted and located relative to published active site regions.\\n\\nConclusionsThis work demonstrates that the 3-mer based classifier can attain high accuracy in subgroup annotation, at rates similar to the current state-of-the-art. Analysis of the classifiers automatically derived models show that the classification decision is based on a combination of conserved features, including a significant number of residue regions that have not been previously suggested as informative by other classifiers but for which there is evidence of functional relevance.",

    "abstract": "Transcription of many bacterial genes is regulated by alternative RNA polymerase sigma factors as the sigma 54 ({sigma}54). A single essential {sigma} promotes transcription of thousands of genes and many alternative {sigma} factors promote transcription of multiple specialized genes required for coping with stress or development. Bacterial genomes have two families of sigma factors, sigma 70 ({sigma}70) and sigma 54 ({sigma}54). {sigma}54 uses a more complex mechanism with specialized enhancers-binding proteins and DNA melting and is well known for its role in regulation of nitrogen metabolism in proteobacteria. The identification of these regulatory elements is the main step to understand the metabolic networks. In this study, we propose a supervised pattern recognition model with neural network to identify Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs) for {sigma}54. This approach is capable of detecting {sigma}54 TFBSs with sensitivity higher than 98% in recent published data. False positives are reduced with the addition of ANN and feature extraction, which increase the specificity of the program. We also propose a free, fast and friendly tool for {sigma}54 recognition and a {sigma}54 related genes database, available for consult. S54Finder can analyze from short DNA sequences to complete genomes and is available online. The software was used to determine {sigma}54 TFBSs on the complete bacterial genomes database from NCBI and the result is available for comparison. S54Finder does the identification of {sigma}54 regulated genes for a large set of genomes allowing evolutionary and conservation studies of the regulation system between the organisms.",

    "abstract": "Genotypic resistance interpretation systems for the prediction and interpretation of HIV-1 antiretroviral resistance are an important part of the clinical management of HIV-1 infection. Current interpretation systems are generally hosted on remote webservers that enable clinical laboratories to generate resistance predictions easily and quickly from patient HIV-1 sequences encoding the primary targets of modern antiretroviral therapy. However they also potentially compromise a health providers ethical, professional, and legal obligations to data security, patient information confidentiality, and data provenance. Furthermore, reliance on web-based algorithms makes the clinical management of HIV-1 dependent on a network connection. Here, we describe the development and validation of sierra-local, an open-source implementation of the Stanford HIVdb genotypic resistance interpretation system for local execution, which aims to resolve the ethical, legal, and infrastructure issues associated with remote computing. This package reproduces the HIV-1 resistance scoring by the web-based Stanford HIVdb algorithm with a high degree of concordance (99.997%) and a higher level of performance than current methods of accessing HIVdb programmatically.",

    "abstract": "Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt-1) and synaptotagmin-7 (Syt-7) contain analogous tandem C2 domains, C2A and C2B, which together serve as a Ca2+ sensor to bind membranes and promote the stabilization of exocytotic fusion pores. Functionally, Syt-1 triggers fast release of neurotransmitters, while Syt-7 is involved in lower-Ca2+ processes such as hormone secretion. Evidence suggests that Syt-1 C2 domains bind membranes cooperatively, penetrating farther into membranes as the C2AB tandem than as individual C2 domains. In contrast, we previously reported that the two C2 domains of Syt-7 bind membranes independently, based in part on measurements of their liposome dissociation kinetics. Here, we have investigated the effects of C2A-C2B interdomain cooperativity with Syt-1 and Syt-7 using directly comparable measurements. We report Ca2+ sensitivities, dissociation kinetics, and membrane insertion using liposomes approximating physiological lipid compositions. Equilibrium Ca2+ titrations confirm that the Syt-7 C2AB tandem has a greater Ca2+ sensitivity of membrane binding than either of its individual domains. Stopped-flow fluorescence kinetic measurements show that Syt-1 C2AB dissociates from liposome membranes much more slowly than either of its isolated C2 domains, suggesting that the two C2 domains of Syt-1 bind membranes cooperatively. In contrast, the dominant population of Syt-7 C2AB has a dissociation rate comparable to its C2A domain, indicating a lack of cooperativity, while only a small subpopulation dissociates at a slower rate. Measurements using an environment-sensitive fluorescent probe indicate that the Syt-7 C2B domain inserts more deeply into membranes as part of the C2AB tandem, similarly to Syt-1. Overall, these measurements are consistent with a model in which the structural linkage of C2A and C2B impacts the membrane-binding geometry of synaptotagmin C2B domains, but imparts little or no cooperativity to Syt-7 membrane binding and dissociation events that are dominated by its C2A domain.",

    "abstract": "By removing the confounding factor of cellular heterogeneity, single cell genomics can revolutionize the study of development and disease, but methods are needed to simplify comparison among individuals. To develop such a framework, we assayed the transcriptome in 62,600 single cells from the testes of wildtype mice, and mice with gonadal defects due to disruption of the genes Mlh3, Hormad1, Cul4a or Cnp. The resulting expression atlas of distinct cell clusters revealed novel markers and new insights into testis gene regulation. By jointly analysing mutant and wildtype cells using a model-based factor analysis method, SDA, we decomposed our data into 46 components that identify novel meiotic gene regulatory programmes, mutant-specific pathological processes, and technical effects. Moreover, we identify, de novo, DNA sequence motifs associated with each component, and show that SDA can be used to impute expression values from single cell data. Analysis of SDA components also led us to identify a rare population of macrophages within the seminiferous tubules of Mlh3-/- and Hormad1-/- testes, an area typically associated with immune privilege.

    "abstract": "Soft-rot Enterobacteriaceae (SRE) typified by Pectobacterium and Dickeya genera are phytopathogenic bacteria inflicting soft-rot disease in crops worldwide. By combining genomic information from 100 SRE with whole-transcriptome datasets, we identified novel genomic and transcriptional associations amongst key pathogenicity themes in this group. Comparative genomics revealed solid linkage between the type I secretion system (T1SS) and the carotovoricin bacteriophage (Ctv) conserved in 96.7% of Pectobacterium genomes. Moreover, their co-activation during infection might indicate a novel functional association involving T1SS/Ctv. Another bacteriophage-borne genomic region mostly confined in less than 10% of Pectobacterium organisms was found, presumably comprising a novel lineage-specific prophage in the genus. We also detected the transcriptional co-regulation of a previously predicted toxin/immunity pair (WHH and SMI1_KNR4 families) along with type VI secretion system (T6SS) and hcp/vgrG genes suggesting a role in disease development as T6SS-dependent effectors. Further, we showed that another predicted T6SS-dependent endonuclease (AHH-family) exhibited toxicity in ectopic expression assays indicating antibacterial activity. Additionally, we report the striking conservation of group-4-capsule (GFC) cluster in 100 SRE strains which consistently features adjacently conserved serotype-specific gene-arrays comprising a previously unknown organization in GFC clusters. Also, extensive sequence variations found in gfcA orthologs suggest a serotype-specific role in the GfcABCD machinery.",

    "abstract": "During normal healthy ageing there is a decline in the ability to control simple movements, characterised by increased reaction times, movement durations and variability. There is also growing evidence of age-related proprioceptive loss which may contribute to these impairments. However this relationship has not been studied in detail for the upper limb. We recruited 20 younger adults (YAs) and 31 older adults (OAs) who each performed 2 tasks on a 2D robotic manipulandum. The first assessed dynamic proprioceptive acuity using active, multi-joint movements towards visually presented targets, with movement constrained by the robot to a predefined path. Participants made perceptual judgements of the lateral position of the unseen arm. The second was a rapid motor task which required fast, accurate movements to the same targets in the absence of hand position visual feedback, and without constraint by the robot. We predicted that the variable proprioceptive error (uncertainty range) from Task 1 would be increased in physically inactive OAs and would predict increased movement variability in Task 2. Instead we found that physically inactive OAs had larger systematic proprioceptive errors (bias). Neither proprioceptive acuity nor bias was related to motor performance in either age group. We suggest that previously reported estimates of proprioceptive decline with ageing may be exaggerated by task demands and that the extent of these deficits is unrelated to discrete, ballistic movement control. The relationship of dynamic proprioceptive acuity with movement control in tasks which emphasise online proprioceptive feedback for performance is still unclear and warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "1The Early Permian mesosaurs are the oldest known primarily aquatic amniotes. Despite the interest that they have generated over time, their affinities remain controversial. Recently, two hypotheses have been supported, in which mesosaurs are either the sister-group of all other sauropsids, or the sister-group of other parareptiles. We recently upheld the former hypothesis, but in the latest study on mesosaur affinities, MacDougall et al. published a study highly critical of our work, while upholding the hypothesis that mesosaurs are basal parareptiles. We expect that the debate about mesosaur affinities will continue in the foreseeable future, but we wish to respond to the two central comments published by MacDougall et al. in 2018, who argue that variability in the temporal fenestration of early sauropsids, combined with the omission of several recently-described parareptile taxa, explain the differences in topologies between their study and ours. Reanalyzing our data matrix and theirs without characters linked with temporal fenestration, and removing from their matrix the parareptile taxa that they added (and that we omitted) does not alter the resulting topologies. Thus, their main conclusions are false; the differences in taxonomic position of mesosaurs must result from character choice and scoring differences.",

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) impact plant growth and are a major driver of plant diversity and productivity. We quantified the contribution of intra-specific genetic variability in cassava (Manihot esculenta) and Rhizophagus irregularis to gene reprogramming in symbioses using dual RNA-sequencing. A large number of cassava genes exhibited altered transcriptional responses to the fungus but transcription of most of these plant genes (72%) responded in a different direction or magnitude depending on the plant genotype. Two AMF isolates displayed large differences in their transcription, but the direction and magnitude of the transcriptional responses for a large number of these genes was also strongly influenced by the genotype of the plant host. This indicates that unlike the highly conserved plant genes necessary for the symbiosis establishment, plant and fungal gene transcriptional responses are not conserved and are greatly influenced by plant and fungal genetic differences, even at the within-species level. The transcriptional variability detected allowed us to identify an extensive gene network showing the interplay in plant-fungal reprogramming in the symbiosis. Key genes illustrated that the two organisms jointly program their cytoskeleton organisation during growth of the fungus inside roots. Our study reveals that plant and fungal genetic variation plays a strong role in shaping the genetic reprograming in response to symbiosis, indicating considerable genotype x genotype interactions in the mycorrhizal symbiosis. Such variation needs to be considered in order to understand the molecular mechanisms between AMF and their plant hosts in natural communities.",

Remarkably, strong attraction to humans is suppressed for several days after the blood-meal by an unknown mechanism. We investigated a role for neuropeptide Y (NPY)-related signaling in this long-term behavioral suppression, and discovered that drugs targeting human NPY receptors modulate mosquito host-seeking behavior. In a screen of all 49 predicted Ae. aegypti peptide receptors, we identified NPY-like receptor 7 (NPYLR7) as the sole target of these human drugs. To obtain small molecule agonists selective for NPYLR7, we carried out a high-throughput cell-based assay of 265,211 compounds, and isolated 6 highly selective NPYLR7 agonists that inhibit mosquito attraction to humans. NPYLR7 CRISPR-Cas9 null mutants are defective in behavioral suppression, and resistant to these drugs. Finally, we show that these drugs are capable of inhibiting biting and blood-feeding on a live host, suggesting a novel approach to control infectious disease transmission by controlling mosquito behavior.",
