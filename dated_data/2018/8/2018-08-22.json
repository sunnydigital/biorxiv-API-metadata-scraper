    "abstract": "Sodium azide prevents bacterial growth by inhibiting the activity of SecA, which is required for translocation of proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Azide inhibits ATP turnover in vitro, but its mechanism of action in vivo is unclear. To investigate how azide inhibits SecA in cells, we used transposon directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS) to screen a library of transposon insertion mutants for mutations that affect the susceptibility of E. coli to azide. Insertions disrupting components of the Sec machinery generally increased susceptibility to azide, but insertions truncating the C-terminal tail (CTT) of SecA decreased susceptibility of E. coli to azide. Treatment of cells with azide caused increased aggregation of the CTT, suggesting that azide disrupts its structure. Analysis of the metal-ion content of the CTT indicated that SecA binds to iron and the azide disrupts the interaction of the CTT with iron. Azide also disrupted binding of SecA to membrane phospholipids, as did alanine substitutions in the metal-coordinating amino acids. Furthermore, treating purified phospholipid-bound SecA with azide in the absence of added nucleotide disrupted binding of SecA to phospholipids. Our results suggest that azide does not inhibit SecA by inhibiting the rate of ATP turnover in vivo. Rather, azide inhibits SecA by causing it to \\\"backtrack\\\" from the ADP-bound to the ATP-bound conformation, which disrupts the interaction of SecA with the cytoplasmic membrane.\\n\\nSignificance statementSecA is a bacterial ATPase that is required for the translocation of a subset of secreted proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Sodium azide is a well-known inhibitor of SecA, but its mechanism of action in vivo is poorly understood. To investigate this mechanism, we examined the effect of azide on the growth of a library of [~]1 million transposon insertion mutations. Our results suggest that azide causes SecA to backtrack in its ATPase cycle, which disrupts binding of SecA to the membrane and to its metal cofactor, which is iron. Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanism by which SecA drives protein translocation and how this essential biological process can be disrupted.",

    "abstract": "CircRNAs are expressed in many important biological processes. Studying their function requires an effective expression method. When we used intron-mediated enhancement (IME) to improve circRNA expression of mouse Rtn4 (Nogo, a key protein in Nogo-Rho pathways) circRNA as a test case, we achieved a 4-6-fold improvement compared to an existing method. We further developed this approach into a general circRNA expression vector pCircRNA-DMo. An unexpected feature of our approach is its ability to promote translation of circRNA into detectable amounts of proteins. Intriguingly, both monomer and multimer repeating peptides can be observed as a result of rolling circle translation of RTN4 circRNA. We also confirmed the presence of both peptide forms in human and mouse brains, highlighting the significance of circRNA translation in vivo. In summary, we demonstrate the significant advantage of IME in enhancing circRNA biogenesis and hence our vector offers a robust platform for exploring potential circRNA peptide-encoding functions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEntry into genetic competence in streptococci is controlled by ComX, an alternative sigma factor for genes that enable the import of exogenous DNA. In Streptococcus mutans, the immediate activator of comX is the ComRS signaling system, which consists of the cytosolic receptor ComR and the 7-residue signal peptide XIP, which is derived from ComS. Extracellular XIP imported by an oligopeptide permease interacts with ComR to form a transcriptional activator for both comX and comS. Therefore, extracellular XIP can function as an exogenous signal to trigger S. mutans competence. However, the mechanisms that process ComS and export it as XIP are not fully known in S. mutans. The observation that comX is expressed bimodally under some environmental conditions suggests that ComR may also interact with endogenously produced XIP or ComS, creating an intracellular positive feedback loop in comS transcription. Here we use single cell and microfluidic methods to compare the effects of the native comS gene and extracellular XIP on comX expression. We find that deletion of comS reduces the response of comX to extracellular XIP. We also find that comS-overexpressing cells autoactivate their comX even when their growth medium is rapidly exchanged, although this autoactivation requires an intact copy of comS under control of its own promoter. However comS-overexpressing cells do not activate comS-deficient mutants growing in coculture. These data show that individual cells can activate comX without exporting or importing the XIP or ComS signal, and that endogenously and exogenously produced ComS/XIP have inequivalent effects on comX behavior. These data are fully consistent with a model in which intracellular positive feedback in comS transcription plays a role in ComRS signaling, and is responsible for the bimodal expression of comX.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHeterogeneous gene expression in genetically identical populations plays an important role in bacterial persistence and survival under changing environmental conditions. In the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans, the physiological state of genetic competence can exhibit bimodality, with only some cells becoming competent. S. mutans controls its entry into competence by using the ComRS signaling system to activate comX, a gene encoding the master competence regulator ComX. The ComRS system is understood as a quorum sensing system, in which the extracellular accumulation of the small signal peptide XIP, derived from ComS, induces comX expression. We coupled observation of bacteria that fluoresce when comX is active with mathematical analysis and chemical binding assays to show that activation of comX does not necessarily require extracellular XIP or ComS, and that comX-active cells do not necessarily export XIP. Our experiments and mathematical modeling indicate that a positive feedback loop in comS transcription allows a cell to activate comX in response to its own XIP or ComS in the absence of extracellular XIP, or to amplify its comX response to extracellular XIP if present. Such positive feedback loops are often the cause of bimodal gene expression like that seen in S. mutans competence.",

We develop a weakly supervised deep learning model for classification of aortic valve malformations using up to 4,000 unlabeled cardiac MRI sequences. Instead of requiring highly curated training data, weak supervision relies on noisy heuristics defined by domain experts to programmatically generate large-scale, imperfect training labels. For aortic valve classification, models trained with imperfect labels substantially outperform a supervised model trained on hand-labeled MRIs. In an orthogonal validation experiment using health outcomes data, our model identifies individuals with a 1.8-fold increase in risk of a major adverse cardiac event.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCorrect quantification of transcript expression is essential to understand the functional products of the genome in different physiological conditions and developmental stages. Recently, the development of high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) allows the researchers to perform transcriptome analysis for the organisms without the reference genome and transcriptome. For such projects, de novo transcriptome assembly must be carried out prior to quantification. However, a large number of erroneous contigs produced by the assemblers might result in unreliable estimation on the abundance of transcripts. In this regard, this study comprehensively investigates how assembly quality affects the performance of quantification for RNA-Seq analysis based on de novo transcriptome assembly.\\n\\nResultsSeveral important factors that might seriously affect the accuracy of the RNA-Seq analysis were thoroughly discussed. First, we found that the assemblers perform comparatively well for the transcriptomes with lower biological complexity. Second, we examined the over-extended and incomplete contigs, and then demonstrated that assembly completeness has a strong impact on the estimation of contig abundance. Lastly, we investigated the behavior of the quantifiers with respect to sequence ambiguity which might be originally present in the transcriptome or accidentally produced by assemblers. The results suggest that the quantifiers often over-estimate the expression of family-collapse contigs and under-estimate the expression of duplicated contigs. For organisms without reference transcriptome, it remained challenging to detect the inaccurate abundance estimation on family-collapse contigs. On the contrary, we observed that the situation of under-estimation on duplicated contigs can be warned through analyzing the read distribution of the duplicated contigs.\\n\\nConclusionsIn summary, we explicated the behavior of quantifiers when erroneous contigs are present and we outlined the potential problems that the assemblers might cause for the downstream analysis of RNA-Seq. We anticipate the analytic results conducted in this study provides valuable insights for future development of transcriptome assembly and quantification.\\n\\nAvailabilitywe proposed an open-source Python based package QuantEval that builds connected components for the assembled contigs based on sequence similarity and evaluates the quantification results for each connected component.

    "abstract": "In bacteria, the translocation of a subset of proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane by the Sec machinery requires SecA. Although SecA can recognise nascent polypeptides, the mechanism of cotranslational substrate protein recognition is not known. Here, we investigated the role of the C-terminal tail (CTT) of SecA, which consists of a flexible linker (FLD) and a small metal-binding domain (MBD), in its interaction with nascent polypeptides. Phylogenetic analysis and ribosome binding experiments indicated that the MBD interacts with 70S ribosomes. Disruption of the entire CTT or the MBD alone had opposing effects on ribosome binding, substrate-protein binding, ATPase activity and in vivo function. Autophotocrosslinking, mass spectrometry, x-ray crystallography and small-angle x-ray scattering experiments provided insight into the CTT-mediated conformational changes in SecA. Finally, photocrosslinking experiments indicated that binding of SecA to substrate protein affected its interaction with the ribosome. Taken together, our results suggest a mechanism for substrate protein recognition.\\n\\nImpact StatementSecA is an evolutionarily conserved ATPase that is required for the translocation of a subset of proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane in bacteria.

    "abstract": "Rod shaped bacteria grow by adding material into their cell wall via the action of two spatially distinct enzymatic systems: The Rod system moves around the cell circumference, while the class A penicillin-binding proteins (aPBPs) are unorganized. To understand how the combined action of these two systems defines bacterial dimensions, we examined how each system affects the growth and width of Bacillus subtilis, as well as the mechanical anisotropy and orientation of material within their sacculi. We find that rod diameter is not determined by MreB, rather it depends on the balance between the systems: The Rod system reduces diameter, while aPBPs increase it. RodA/PBP2A can both thin or widen cells, depending on its levels relative to MreBCD. Increased Rod system activity correlates with an increased density of directional MreB filaments, and a greater fraction of directionally moving PBP2A molecules. This increased circumferential synthesis increases the amount of oriented material within the sacculi, increasing their mechanical anisotropy and reinforcing rod shape. Together, these experiments explain how the combined action of the two main cell wall synthetic systems build rods of different widths, a model that appears generalizable: Escherichia coli containing Rod system mutants show the same relationship between the density of directionally moving MreB filaments and cell width.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivePeripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) obtained from pulse oximetry is a widely used physiological measurement. Clinical interpretation is limited by the nonlinear relationship between SpO2, degree of impairment in gas exchange, and effect of altitude. SpO2 is frequently dichotomized to overcome these limitations during prediction modelling. Using the known physiological relationship between virtual shunt and SpO2, we propose the saturation gap as a transformation of SpO2.\\n\\nApproachWe computed the theoretical virtual shunt corresponding to various SpO2 values and derived an accurate approximation formula between virtual shunt and SpO2. The approximation was based on previously described empiric observations and known physiological relationships. We evaluated the utility of the saturation gap in a clinical study predicting the need for facility admission in children in a rural health-care setting.\\n\\nMain ResultsThe transformation was saturation gap = 49.314*log10(103.711 - SpO2) -37.315. The ability to predict hospital admission based on a continuous variable SpO2 or saturation gap produced an identical area under the curve of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.69-0.73), compared to only 0.57 (CI: 0.56-0.58) based on diagnosis of hypoxemia (defined as SpO2<90%). However, SpO2 demonstrated a lack of fit compared to saturation gap (goodness-of-fit test p-value <0.0001 versus 0.098). The observed admission rates varied linearly with saturation gap but varied nonlinearly with SpO2.\\n\\nSignificanceThe saturation gap estimates a continuous linearly interpretable disease severity from SpO2 and improves clinical prediction models. The saturation gap will also allow for straightforward incorporation of altitude in interpretation of measurements of SpO2.",

The number of paths detected with fair true connectivity (r >0.4) was 4 for the SPM pipeline but 352 for the SG based pipeline.

    "abstract": "Monoubiquitination of histone H2B (H2B-Ub) plays a role in transcription and DNA replication, and is required for normal localization of the histone chaperone, FACT. In yeast, H2B-Ub is deubiquitinated by Ubp8, a subunit of SAGA, and Ubp10. Although they target the same substrate, loss of Ubp8 and Ubp10 causes different phenotypes and alters the transcription of different genes. We show that Ubp10 has poor activity on yeast nucleosomes, but that addition of FACT stimulates Ubp10 activity on nucleosomes and not on other substrates. Consistent with a role for FACT in deubiquitinating H2B in vivo, a FACT mutant strain shows elevated levels of H2B-Ub. Combination of FACT mutants with deletion of Ubp10, but not Ubp8, confers increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea and activates a cryptic transcription reporter, suggesting that FACT and Ubp10 may coordinate nucleosome assembly during DNA replication and transcription. Our findings reveal unexpected interplay between H2B deubiquitination and nucleosome dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional profiling has revealed a diverse range of cancer cell states, however an understanding of their function has remained elusive. Using a combination of zebrafish melanoma modeling and human validation, we have identified a conserved stress-like state that confers intrinsic drug resistance. The stress-like state expresses genes such as fos, hsp70 and ubb, all required for adaptation to diverse cellular stresses, and we confirmed its existence using immunofluorescence and spatial transcriptomics. We provide evidence that this state has a higher tumor seeding capabilities compared to non-stressed cells, and confers intrinsic resistance to MEK inhibitors, a commonly used melanoma therapeutic. Furthermore, the stress-like program can be induced by extrinsic processes such as heat shock, and confers resistance to both MEK and BRAF inhibitors in both zebrafish and human melanomas. Collectively, our study suggests that the transcriptional states associated with therapeutic failure are established during the earliest steps of tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDColorectal cancer is an epigenetically heterogeneous disease, however the extent and spectrum of the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) is not clear.\\n\\nRESULTSAn unselected cohort of 216 colorectal cancers clustered into five clinically and molecularly distinct subgroups using Illumina 450K DNA methylation arrays. CIMP-High cancers were most frequent in the proximal colons of female patients. These dichotomised into CIMP-Hl and CIMP-H2 based on methylation profile which was supported by over representation of BRAF (74%, P<0.0001) or KRAS (55%, P<0.0001) mutation, respectively. Congruent with increasing methylation, there was a stepwise increase in patient age from 62 years in the CI MP-Negative subgroup to 75 years in the CIMP-Hl subgroup (P<0.0001). There was a striking association between PRC2-marked loci and those subjected to significant gene body methylation in CIMP-type cancers (P<1.6xl078). We identified oncogenes susceptible to gene body methylation and Wnt pathway antagonists resistant to gene body methylation. CIMP cluster specific mutations were observed for genes involved in chromatin remodelling, such as in the SWI/SNF and NuRD complexes, suggesting synthetic lethality.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONThere are five clinically and molecularly distinct subgroups of colorectal cancer based on genome wide epigenetic profiling. These analyses highlighted an unidentified role for gene body methylation in progression of serrated neoplasia. Subgroup-specific mutation of distinct epigenetic regulator genes revealed potentially druggable vulnerabilities for these cancers, which may provide novel precision medicine approaches.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus gattii is a pathogenic yeast of humans and other animals, which causes disease predominantly in immunocompetent hosts. Infection begins when aerosolized yeast or spores enter the body, triggering an immune response, including engulfment by macrophages. To understand the early transcriptional signals in both the yeast and its mammalian host, we performed a time-course dual RNA-seq experiment for four lineages of C. gattii (VGI-IV) interacting with mouse macrophages at 1hr, 3hr and 6hr post infection. Comparison of in vitro to ex vivo gene expression indicates lineage VGII is transcriptionally divergent to non-VGII lineages, including differential expression of genes involved in capsule synthesis, capsule attachment and ergosterol production. Various paralogs demonstrate sub-functionalisation between lineages including an upregulation of capsule biosynthesis-related gene CAP2, and downregulation of CAP1 in VGIII. Isolates also compensate for lineage-specific gene-losses by over-expression of genetically similar paralogs, including an over-expression of capsule gene CAS3 in VGIV having lost CAS31. Differential expression of one in five C. gattii genes was detected following co-incubation with mouse macrophages; all isolates showed high induction of oxidative-reduction functions and a downregulation of capsule attachment genes. We also show that VGII switches expression of two laccase paralogs (from LAC1 to LAC2) during co-incubation of macrophages. Finally, we found that mouse macrophages respond to all four lineages of C. gattii by upregulating FosB/Jun/Egr1 regulatory proteins at early time points. This study highlights the evolutionary breadth of expression profiles amongst the lineages of C. gattii and the diversity of transcriptional responses at this host-pathogen interface.\\n\\nImportanceThe transcriptional profiles of related pathogens and their response to host induced stresses underpin their pathogenicity. Expression differences between related pathogens during host interaction can indicate when and how these genes contribute to virulence, ultimately informing new and improved treatment strategies for those diseases. In this paper, we compare the transcriptional profiles of five isolates representing four lineages of C. gattii in rich media. Our analyses identified key processes including cell capsule, ergosterol production and melanin that are differentially expressed between lineages, and we find that VGII has the most distinct profile in terms of numbers of differentially expressed genes. All lineages have also undergone sub-functionalisation for various paralogs including capsule biosynthesis and attachment genes. Most genes appeared down-regulated during co-incubation with macrophages, with the largest decrease observed for capsule attachment genes, which appears coordinated with a stress response, as all lineages also upregulated oxidative stress response genes. Furthermore, VGII upregulated many genes that are linked to ergosterol biosynthesis and switched expression of the laccase LAC1 to LAC2 ex vivo. Finally, we saw a pronounced increase in the FosB/Jun/Egr1 regulatory proteins at early time points in bone marrow derived macrophages, marking a role in the host response to C. gattii. This work highlights the dynamic roles of key C. gattii virulence genes in response to macrophages.",

    "abstract": "Xanthomonas arboricola pv. juglandis (Xaj) is the etiological agent of walnut diseases affecting leaves, fruits, branches and trunks. Although this phytopathogen is widely spread in walnut producing regions and has a considerable genetic diversity, there is still a poor understanding of its epidemic behaviour. To shed some light on the epidemiology of these bacteria, 131 Xanthomonas isolates obtained from 64 walnut trees were included in this study considering epidemiological metadata such as year of isolation, bioclimatic regions, walnut cultivars, production regimes, host walnut specimen and plant organs. Genetic diversity was assessed by multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and dot blot hybridization patterns obtained with nine Xaj-specific DNA markers (XAJ1 - XAJ9). The results showed that Xanthomonas isolates grouped in ten distinct MLSA clusters and in 18 hybridization patterns (HP). The majority of isolates (112 out of 131) were closely related with X. arboricola strains of pathovar juglandis as revealed by MLSA (clusters I to VI) and hybridize with more than five Xaj-specific markers. Nineteen isolates clustered in four MLSA groups (clusters VII to X) which do not include Xaj strains, and hybridize to less than five markers. Taking this data together, was possible to distinguish 17 lineages of Xaj, three lineages of X. arboricola and 11 lineages of Xanthomonas sp. Some Xaj lineages appeared to be widely distributed and prevalent across the different bioclimatic regions and apparently not constrained by the other features considered. Assessment of type III effector genes and pathogenicity tests revealed that representative lineages of MLSA clusters VII to X were nonpathogenic on walnut, with exception for strain CPBF 424, making this bacterium particularly appealing to address Xanthomonas pathoadaptations to walnut.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEXanthomonas arboricola pv. juglandis is one of the most serious threats of walnut trees. New disease epidemics caused by this phytopathogen has been a big concern causing high economic losses on walnut production worldwide. Using a comprehensive sampling methodology to disclose the diversity of walnut infective Xanthomonas, we were able to identify a genetic diversity higher than previously reported and generally independent of bioclimatic regions and the other epidemiological features studied. Furthermore, co-colonization of the same plant sample by distinct Xanthomonas strains were frequent and suggested a sympatric lifestyle. The extensive sampling carried out resulted in a set of non-arboricola Xanthomonas sp. strains, including a pathogenic strain, therefore diverging from the nonpathogenic phenotype that have been associated to these atypical strains, generally considered to be commensal. This new strain might be particularly informative to elucidate novel pathogenicity traits and unveil pathogenesis evolution within walnut infective xanthomonads. Beyond extending the present knowledge about walnut infective xanthomonads, this study might contribute to provide a methodological framework for phytopathogen epidemiological studies, still largely disregarded.",

    "abstract": "One sentence SummarySUMO conjugation activity causes formation of SUMO nuclear bodies, which strongly overlap with COP1 bodies thanks to a substrate-binding (VP) motif in the E3 ligase SIZ1 that acts as bridge protein.\\n\\nAbstractAttachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO to substrate proteins modulates their turnover, activity or interaction partners. An unresolved question is how this SUMO conjugation activity concentrates the enzymes involved and the substrates into uncharacterized nuclear bodies (NBs). We here define the requirements for the formation of SUMO NBs and for their subsequent co-localisation with the master regulator of growth, the E3 ubiquitin ligase COP1. COP1 activity results in degradation of transcription factors, which primes the transcriptional response that underlies elongation growth induced by night-time and high ambient temperatures (skoto- and thermomorphogenesis, respectively). SUMO conjugation activity itself is sufficient to target the SUMO machinery into NBs. Co-localization of these bodies with COP1 requires besides SUMO conjugation activity, a SUMO acceptor site in COP1 and the SUMO E3 ligase SIZ1. We find that SIZ1 docks in the substrate-binding pocket of COP1 via two VP motifs - a known peptide motif of COP1 substrates. The data reveal that SIZ1 physically connects COP1 and SUMO conjugation activity in the same NBs that can also contain the blue-light receptors CRY1 and CRY2. Our findings thus suggest that sumoylation apparently coordinates COP1 activity inside these NBs; a mechanism that potentially explains how SIZ1 and SUMO both control the timing and amplitude of the high-temperature growth response. The strong co-localization of COP1 and SUMO in these NBs might also explain why many COP1 substrates are sumoylated.\\n\\nFunding informationThe Netherlands Scientific Organisation (ALW-VIDI grant 864.10.004 to HvdB) and the Topsector T&U program Better Plants for Demands (grant 1409-036 to HvdB), including the partnering breeding companies, supported this work; FM is financially supported by Keygene N.V.

    "abstract": "Light is one of the most important environmental factors affecting plant growth and development. Plants use shade avoidance and shade tolerance strategies to adjust their growth and development thus increase their success in the competition for incoming light. To investigate the mechanism of shade responses in maize (Zea mays), we examined the anatomical and transcriptional dynamics of the early shade response in seedlings of the B73 inbred line. Transcriptome analysis identified 912 differentially expressed genes, including genes involved in light signaling, auxin responses, and cell elongation pathways. Grouping transcription factor family genes and performing enrichment analysis identified multiple types of transcription factors that are differentially regulated by shade and predicted putative core genes responsible for regulating shade avoidance syndrome. For functional tests, we ectopically over-expressed ZmHB53, a type II HD-ZIP transcription factor gene significantly induced by shade, in Arabidopsis thaliana. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing ZmHB53 exhibited narrower leaves, earlier flowering, and enhanced expression of shade-responsive genes, suggesting that ZmHB53 participates in the regulation of shade responses in maize. This study increases our understanding of the regulatory network of the shade response in maize and provides a useful resource for maize genetics and breeding.\\n\\nHighlightOur findings not only increase the understanding of the regulatory network of the shade avoidance in maize, and also provide a useful resource for maize genetics and breeding.",

    "abstract": "Reduced range of motion in the shoulder can be a source of functional limitation. Current quantitative evaluation systems are limited to assessing the functionality or the maximum articular amplitudes in each of the planes of movement, both in isolation. These separate clinical evaluation systems may not allow the identification of the underlying impairments contributing to the functional limitation. The use of inertial sensors to quantify movement in addition to more common clinical assessments of the shoulder may allow clinicians to understand that are potentially unnoticed by the human eye. The main objective of this cross-sectional study was to generate an explanatory model for shoulder abduction based on data from inertial sensors. Shoulder abduction of thirteen older adults suffering from shoulder dysfunction was evaluated using two inertial sensors placed on the humerus and scapula. Movement variables (maximum angular mobility, angular peak of velocity, peak of acceleration) were used to explain the functionality of the upper limb (assessed using the Upper Limb Functional Index). Abduction movement of the shoulder was explained by six variables related to the mobility of the shoulder joint complex. A manova analysis was used to explain the results obtained on the functionality of the upper limb. The MANOVA model based on angular mobility explained 69% of the variance of the ULFI value (r-squared=0.69). The most relevant variables were the abduction-adduction of the humerus and the medial and lateral rotation of the scapula. However, given the limited sample size, none of these individual variables were statistically significant in the decomposition model on their own. The method used in the present study reveals the potential importance of the analysis of the scapular and humeral movements for comprehensive evaluation of the upper limb. Further research should include a wider sample and may seek to use this assessment technique in a range of potential clinical applications.",

Current treatment strategies are inadequate - surgical interventions are irreversible and pharmaceutical interventions have off-target effects. Optogenetic strategies for inhibiting muscle activity have theoretical promise; however, trafficking and expression problems have prevented translatable optogenetic suppression of muscle activity. Here, we exploit recent innovations in opsin engineering to demonstrate virally mediated, temporally specific optogenetic inhibition of motor neurons and muscle activity in vivo. We show that intra-muscular injection of adeno-associated virus serotype 6 can drive expression of the inhibitory channelrhodopsin mutant iC++ in both immunodeficient and wild-type mice. Illumination of the sciatic nerve in wild-type mice resulted in 64.8% inhibition of evoked twitch force. Optical excitation during tetanic stimulation in wild-type mice resulted in 59.1% inhibition at 10 Hz and 55.4% at 25 Hz. The extent of optogenetic inhibition was titratable, and ranged from 0% to 78.4% as illumination intensity was changed from 1 mW to 20 mW/mm2. These results could have therapeutic applicability to disorders such as spasticity, hypertonia and urinary incontinence, and provide a new tool to neuroscientists and muscle physiologists wishing to reversibly inhibit motor neuron activity in vivo.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of the metabolic syndrome is low HDL-cholesterol coupled with high plasma triglycerides (TG), but it is unclear what drives this close association. Plasma triglycerides and HDL cholesterol are thought to communicate through two distinct mechanisms. Firstly, excess surface lipids from VLDL released during lipolysis are transferred to HDL, thereby contributing to HDL directly but also indirectly through providing substrate for LCAT. Secondly, high plasma TG increases clearance of HDL through core-lipid exchange between VLDL and HDL via CETP and subsequent hydrolysis of the TG in HDL, resulting in smaller HDL and thus increased clearance rates.\\n\\nTo test our understanding of how high plasma TG induces low HDL-cholesterol, making use of established knowledge, we developed a comprehensive agent-based model of lipoprotein metabolism which was validated using monogenic disorders of lipoprotein metabolism.\\n\\nBy perturbing plasma TG in the model, we tested whether the current theoretical framework reproduces experimental findings. Interestingly, while increasing plasma TG through simulating decreased lipolysis of VLDL resulted in the expected decrease in HDL cholesterol, perturbing plasma TG through simulating increased VLDL production rates did not result in the expected HDL-TG relation at physiological lipid fluxes. However, model perturbations and experimental findings can be reconciled if we assume a pathway removing excess surface-lipid from VLDL that does not contribute to HDL cholesterol ester production through LCAT. In conclusion, our model simulations suggest that excess surface lipid from VLDL is cleared in part independently from HDL.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWhile it has long been known that high plasma triglycerides are associated with low HDL cholesterol, the reason for this association has remained unclear. One of the proposed mechanisms is that during catabolism of VLDL, lipoproteins rich in triglyceride, the excess surface of these particles become a source for the production of HDL cholesterol, and that therefore decreased catabolism of VLDL will lead to both higher plasma triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol. Another proposed mechanism is that during increased production of VLDL, there will be increased exchange of core lipids between VLDL and HDL, with subsequent hydrolysis of the triglyceride in HDL, leading to smaller HDL that is cleared more rapidly. To investigate these mechanisms further we developed a computational model based on established knowledge concerning lipoprotein metabolism and validated the model with known findings in monogenetic disorders. Upon perturbing the plasma triglycerides within the model by increasing the VLDL production rate, we unexpectedly found an increase in both triglyceride and HDL cholesterol. However, upon assuming that less excess surface lipid is available to HDL, HDL decreases in response to increased VLDL production. We therefore propose that there must be a pathway removing excess surface lipids that is independent from HDL.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "PURPOSETo examine the effects of platelet-activating factor (PAF) on tight junction permeability in cultured retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells.\\n\\nMETHODSA human RPE cell line (ARPE-19) cultured on microporous filter supports was used. PAF and WEB2086, which is a specific PAF-receptor (PAF-R) antagonist, were added to the culture medium. RPE monolayer permeability was measured using transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and sodium fluorescein flux. The expression of the tight junction protein zonula occludens (ZO)-1 was assessed using immunohistochemistry. We also measured the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level in cultures treated with PAF, and RPE monolayer permeability was measured again in the presence of neutralizing antibodies to VEGF.\\n\\nRESULTSPAF significantly decreased the TER of the RPE monolayer and enhanced sodium fluorescein flux. ZO-1 expression was downregulated in PAF-supplemented medium. These effects were abolished with PAF-R blockage. PAF stimulation increased VEGF expression in RPE cells, and neutralization of VEGF with antibodies caused partial recovery of barrier properties.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThe tight junctions of ARPE-19 cells are altered by PAF, and these effects are partly mediated by the upregulation of VEGF expression in these cells. Our results contribute to growing evidence supporting the role of PAF in choroidal neovascularization, and our findings suggest that PAF is a novel therapeutic target for increased permeability of the RPE monolayer.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRabies is an emerging and re-emerging lethal encephalitis causing 26,400 to 61,000 human deaths annually. Approximately 20,000 people die of rabies every year in India that accounts to 36% of the worlds rabies deaths. Rabies is endemic among domestic dogs in India and there are conflicting reports on the currently circulating RABV lineages in domestic dogs in India. Further, movement of humans and animals between Sri Lanka and southern coastal states of India was proposed to be a source of the emergence of variant RABV in India. For effective prevention and control of rabies in India it is essential to establish the genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics of RBAV currently circulating in India.\\n\\nMethodsWe carried out molecular evolution and recombination analyses of nucleoprotein (N) and glycoprotein (G) genes of 26 RABV isolates from southern Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Goa.\\n\\nResultsWe found continued co-circulation of ancient subcontinent lineage despite predominance of the recent arctic-like lineage RABVs in southern India. The mean rate of nucleotide substitution in G and N genes was 1.32 x 10-3 and 1.91 x 10-4 substitutions/site/yr respectively. The study also found recombination in both N and G genes and a higher mean rate of evolutionary changes in G gene among Indian dog RABV isolates than those of lyssaviruses. The Indian subcontinent lineage RABV isolates investigated in this study clustered closely with other subcontinent lineage viruses from Sri Lanka highlighting the continued incursion and/or circulation of the variant subcontinent lineages of RABVs between India and Sri Lanka.\\n\\nConclusionWe report that there is enzootic viral establishment of two distinct RABV lineages in domestic dogs in India that are evolving at a greater rate.\\n\\nAuthor summaryRabies is a fatal viral disease that has no treatment and can only be prevented by post-exposure vaccination. In many parts of Asia and Africa, rabies continues to be a major public health threat almost always caused by dog bites. In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity and rate of evolution among rabies viruses isolated from dogs in India. We found that two distinct lineages of Rabies viruses (RABVs) namely the ancient subcontinent lineage and a more recent arctic-like lineage co-circulate among dogs in India. Notably, our study found that the dog rabies viruses in India are undergoing recombination and evolving at a higher rate than other lyssaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed continued incursion and/or circulation of the variant subcontinent lineages of RABVs in India that might have been originated from Sri Lanka. Our study indicates that two distinct lineages of RABVs are maintained and currently circulate among dog population in India",

Here we focus on a prototypical multidomain RNA-binding protein, IMP3 (also called IGF2BP3), which contains six RNA-binding domains (RBDs): four KH and two RRM domains. We have established an integrative systematic strategy, combining single-domain-resolved SELEX-seq, motif-spacing analyses, in vivo iCLIP, functional validation assays, and structural biology. This approach identifies the RNA-binding specificity and RNP topology of IMP3, involving all six RBDs and a cluster of up to five distinct and appropriately spaced CA-rich and GGC-core RNA elements, covering a >100 nucleotide-long target RNA region. Our generally applicable approach explains both specificity and flexibility of IMP3-RNA recognition, providing a paradigm for the function of multivalent interactions with multidomain RNA-binding proteins in gene regulation.",

Little is known about the physical properties of germ granules and how these relate to germ cell function. Here we study two types of germ granules in the Drosophila embryo: cytoplasmic germ granules that instruct primordial germ cells (PGCs) formation and nuclear germ granules within early PGCs with unknown function. We show that cytoplasmic and nuclear germ granules are phase transitioned condensates nucleated by Oskar protein that display liquid as well as hydrogel-like properties. Focusing on nuclear granules, we find that Oskar drives their formation in heterologous cell systems. Multiple, independent Oskar protein domains synergize to promote granule phase separation. Deletion of Oskars nuclear localization sequence specifically ablates nuclear granules in cell systems. In the embryo, nuclear germ granules promote germ cell divisions thereby increasing PGC number for the next generation.",

Actomyosin is enriched along compartment boundaries during segmentation of the Drosophila embryo, forming supracellular contractile cables that keep cells segregated at boundaries. Here, we show that these contractile actomyosin cables bias the orientation of division in cells in contact with compartment boundaries. By decreasing actomyosin cable tension locally using laser ablation or, conversely ectopically increasing tension using laser wounding, we demonstrate that localised subcellular force is necessary and sufficient to orient mitoses in vivo. Moreover this bias is independent of cell geometry and involves capture of the spindle pole by the actomyosin cortex.",

Here, we carried out an extensive experimental and computational study to quantitatively understand the evolutionary dynamics of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme in the presence of trimethoprim induced selection. Biochemical and structural characterization of resistance-conferring mutations targeting a total of ten residues spanning the substrate binding pocket of DHFR revealed distinct resistance mechanisms. Next, we experimentally measured biochemical parameters (Km, Ki, and kcat) for a mutant library carrying all possible combinations of six resistance-conferring DHFR mutations and quantified epistatic interactions between them. We found that the epistasis between DHFR mutations is high-order for catalytic power of DHFR (kcat and Km), but less prevalent for trimethoprim affinity (Ki). Taken together our data provide a concrete illustration of how epistatic coupling at the level of biochemical parameters can give rise to complex fitness landscapes, and suggest new strategies for developing mutant specific inhibitors.",

This condition is characterized by partial alopecia, missing and malformed teeth and a lack of eccrine sweat glands. Clinical signs including dental X-raying and histopathological findings were consistent with an ectodermal dysplasia. Pedigree analysis supported an X-recessive mode of inheritance. Whole-genome sequencing of one affected puppy and his dam identified a 1-basepair deletion within the ectodysplasin-A gene (CM000039.3:g.54509504delT, PRJEB27789). Sanger sequencing of further family members confirmed the PRJEB27789-variant. Validation in all available family members, 37 unrelated shorthaired standard Dachshunds, 128 Dachshunds from all other breeds and samples from 34 dog breeds revealed the PRJEB27789 variant to be private for this family. Two heterozygous females showed very mild alopecia but normal dentition. Since the dam is demonstrably the only heterozygous animal in the ancestry of the affected animals, we assume that the PRJEB27789-variant arose in the germline of the granddam or in an early embryonic stage of the dam. In conclusion, we detected a very recent de-novo EDA mutation causing X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia in the shorthaired standard Dachshund.",

To understand how interactions between four key pluripotency transcription factors (TFs), SOX2, POU5F1 (OCT4), KLF4, and ESRRB, contribute to cis-regulation in mouse ESCs, we assayed two massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) libraries composed of different combinations of binding sites for these TFs. One library was an exhaustive set of synthetic cis-regulatory elements and the second was a set of genomic sequences with comparable configurations of binding sites. Comparisons between the libraries allowed us to determine the regulatory grammar requirements for these binding sites in constrained synthetic contexts versus genomic sequence contexts. We found that binding site quality is a common attribute for active elements in both the synthetic and genomic contexts. For synthetic regulatory elements, the level of expression is mostly determined by the number of binding sites but is tuned by a grammar that includes position effects. Surprisingly, this grammar appears to only play a small role in setting the output levels of genomic sequences. The relative activity of genomic sequences is best explained by the predicted affinity of binding sites, regardless of identity, and optimized spacing between sites. Our findings highlight the need for detailed examinations of complex sequence space when trying to understand cis-regulatory grammar in the genome.",

While this process is well understood for self-sufficient organisms, dependent offspring, such as bee larvae, in practice have limited food choices because food is provided by parents. Nutrient balancing may therefore be achieved by offspring, by parents on offsprings behalf, or by both, whether cooperatively or in conflict.\nC_LIO_LIWe used the Geometric Framework to investigate the capacity of dependent larval mason bees (Osmia bicornis) to regulate their intake of protein and carbohydrate. Female Osmia seal eggs individually inside cells they have provisioned with pollen, and have no contact with developing offspring, allowing offspring choices to be studied in isolation. Herbivorous insect larvae are typically expected to balance protein and carbohydrate to maximise growth and reproduction.\nC_LIO_LIContrary to prediction, carbohydrate and not protein mediated both growth and survival to pupation. Accordingly, larvae prioritised maintaining a constant intake of carbohydrate and self-selected a relatively carbohydrate biased diet compared to other hymenopterans, while tolerating wide excesses and deficiencies of protein, rendering them potentially vulnerable to dietary change or manipulation. Reasons for prioritising carbohydrate may include (1) the relative abundance of protein in their normal pollen diet, (2) the relative paucity of nectar in parental provisions making carbohydrate a scarce resource, or (3) the requirement for diapause for all O. bicornis larvae. Larvae were intolerant of moderate dietary dilution, likely reflecting an evolutionary history of nutrient-dense food.\nC_LIO_LIOur results demonstrate that dependent offspring can remain active participants in balancing their own nutrients even when sedentary, and, moreover, even in mass provisioning systems where parents and offspring have no physical contact. Research should now focus on whether and how evolutionary interests of parent and dependent offspring coincide or conflict with respect to food composition, and the implications for species resilience to changing environments.\nC_LI",

High frequencies of reproducible targeted integration of a wild-type cDNA into the endogenous start codon of a gene in LT-HSCs could provide a robust genome editing approach to cure genetic diseases in which patients have different mutations throughout the gene. We describe a clinically relevant method for correcting X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1). By using a highly specific and active CRISPR/Cas9-AAV6 based strategy and selection-free approach, we achieve up to 20% genome integration frequencies in LT-HSCs of a full-length IL2RG cDNA at the endogenous start site as demonstrated by serial transplantation and analysis of genome edited human cells eight months following initial transplantation. In addition to high frequencies of functional gene correction in LT-HSCs we observed no evidence of abnormal hematopoiesis following transplantation, a functional measure of the lack of genotoxicity. Deep analysis of potential off-target activity detected two sites with low frequency (<0.3%) of off-target mutations. The level of off-target mutations was reduced to below the limit of detection using a high fidelity Cas9. Moreover, karyotype evaluation identified no genomic instability events. We achieved high levels of genome targeting frequencies (median 45%) in CD34+ HSPCs from six SCID-X1 patients and demonstrate rescue of lymphopoietic defect of patient derived cells both in vitro and in vivo. In sum, our study provides specificity, toxicity and efficacy data supportive of clinical development of genome editing to treat SCID-Xl.",

    "abstract": "Genomes and transcriptomes are now typically sequenced by individual labs, but analysing them often remains challenging. One essential step in many analyses lies in identifying orthologs--corresponding genes across multiple species--but this is far from trivial. The OMA (Orthologous MAtrix) database is a leading resource for identifying orthologs among publicly available, complete genomes. Here, we describe the OMA pipeline available as a standalone program for Linux and Mac. When run on a cluster, it has native support for the LSF, SGE, PBS Pro, and Slurm job schedulers and can scale up to thousands of parallel processes. Another key feature of OMA standalone is that users can combine their own data with existing public data by exporting genomes and pre-computed alignments from the OMA database, which currently contains over 2100 complete genomes. We compare OMA standalone to other methods in the context of phylogenetic tree inference, by inferring a phylogeny of the Lophotrochozoa, a challenging clade within the Protostomes. We also discuss other potential applications of OMA standalone, including identifying gene families having undergone duplications/losses in specific clades, and identifying potential drug targets in non-model organisms.

We identified a new colorectal cancer (CRC)-specific molecule, TMEM180, a predicted eleven-pass transmembrane protein that apparently functions as a cation symporter. Our anti-TMEM180 monoclonal antibody (mAb) eradicated SW480 CRC xenografts in mice. The TMEM180 promoter region contains ten hypoxia-responsive element consensus sequences; accordingly SW480 cells upregulated TMEM180 under low-oxygen conditions. TMEM180 expression in SW480 cells was positively correlated with anchorage-independent colony formation and tumourigenesis. TMEM180-positive SW480 cells resided at the tumour-stroma interface manifested by SMA-positive fibroblasts, also known as the tumour niche. Some clusters of TMEM180-positive cells adjacent to the niche were integrin 6-positive.

In fact, HPVC treated with BMP2, cultured onto mouse AVC cushions, or transplanted into the AVC of embryonic mouse hearts, underwent endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and expressed markers of valve interstitial cells of different valvular layers demonstrating tissue functionality. HPVCs also differentiated into tendinous/chondrogenic cells in line with the valvular repertoire. Extending this valvulogenic model to patient specific iPS cells, we recapitulated features of mitral valve prolapse and uncovered that dysregulation of the SHH pathway is likely to be at the origin of the disease thus providing a putative therapeutic target.\\n\\nHuman pluripotent stem cells recapitulate early valvulogenesis and provide a powerful model to systematically decipher the origin and lineage contribution of different valvular cell types in humans as well as to study valve diseases in a dish.",

    "abstract": "Human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) DNA is frequently detected in human samples, especially after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Diagnostic assays distinguishing HHV-6B reactivation from latency are limited, and this has contributed to confusion in research and made the design of clinical approaches to diagnose and treat HHV-6-associated diseases challenging. We used RNA sequencing to characterize and compare the HHV-6B transcriptome in multiple in vivo and in vitro sample types, including 1) whole blood from HCT recipients with and without HHV-6B plasma viremia; 2) tumor tissue samples from subjects with large B cell lymphoma infected with HHV-6B; 3) lymphoblastoid cell lines from subjects with inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6B or latent infection with HHV-6B; and 4) HHV-6B Z29 infected SupT1 CD4+ T cells. We demonstrated substantial overlap in the HHV-6B transcriptome observed in in vivo and in vitro samples, although there was variability in the breadth and quantity of gene expression across samples. No HHV-6B transcripts were detected in whole blood samples from subjects without plasma HHV-6B viremia. The HHV-6B viral polymerase gene U38 was the only HHV-6B transcript detected in all RNA-seq data sets and was one of the most highly expressed genes. Using a novel reverse transcription PCR assay targeting HHV-6B U38, we identified U38 messenger RNA in all tested whole blood samples from patients with concurrent HHV-6B viremia, indicating its utility as a diagnostic assay for HHV-6B replication. This study demonstrates the feasibility of pathogen transcriptome analyses in HCT recipients to identify better targets for diagnostic, and potentially therapeutic, applications.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEInfection with human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B), a DNA virus, occurs early in life, results in chronic viral latency in diverse cell types, and affects the population at large. Additionally, HHV- 6B can integrate into germline chromosomes, resulting in individuals with viral DNA in every nucleated cell. Given that PCR to detect viral DNA is the mainstay for diagnosing HHV-6B infection, the characteristics of HHV-6B infection complicate efforts to distinguish between latent and active viral infection, particularly in immunocompromised patients who have frequent HHV- 6B reactivation. In this study, we used RNA sequencing to characterize the HHV-6B gene expression profile in multiple sample types, and our findings identified evidence-based targets for diagnostic tests that distinguish between latent and active viral infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe identification of bona fide microbial taxa in microbiomes derived from ancient and historical samples is complicated by the unavoidable mixture between DNA from ante- and post-mortem microbial colonizers. One possibility to distinguish between these sources of microbial DNA is querying for the presence of age-associated degradation patterns typical of ancient DNA (aDNA). The presence of uracils, resulting from cytosine deamination, has been detected ubiquitously in aDNA retrieved from diverse sources, and used as an authentication criterion. Here, we employ a library preparation method that separates molecules that carry uracils from those that do not for a set of samples that includes Neandertal remains, herbarium specimens and archaeological plant remains.\n\nResultsWe show that sequencing DNA libraries enriched in molecules carrying uracils effectively amplifies age associated degradation patterns in microbial mixtures of ancient and historical origin. This facilitates the discovery of authentic ancient microbial taxa in cases where degradation patterns are difficult to detect due to large sequence divergence in microbial mixtures. Additionally, the relative enrichment of taxa in the uracil enriched fraction can help to identify bona fide ancient microbial taxa that could be missed using a more targeted approach.\n\nConclusionsOur experiments show, that in addition to its use in enriching authentic endogenous DNA of organisms of interest, the selective enrichment of damaged DNA molecules can be a valuable tool in the discovery of ancient microbial taxa.",

By modulating NA stalk length in recombinant IAVs, we show that anti-stem Abs inhibit virus release from infected cells by blocking NA, accounting for their in vitro neutralization activity. NA inhibition contributes to anti-stem Ab protection in influenza infected mice, likely due at least in part to NA-mediated inhibition of Fc{gamma}R dependent activation of innate immune cells by antibody bound to virions.

Mice with a CAD-linked LRP6 mutation exhibit obstructive coronary artery disease characterized by reduced TCF7L2 expression and dedifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC). While TCF7L2 maintains stemness and promotes proliferation in embryonic tissues and adult stem cells, its role and mechanisms of action in VSMC differentiation is not understood. Using multiple mouse models, we demonstrate here that TCF7L2 promotes differentiation and inhibits proliferation of VSMCs. TCF7L2 accomplishes these effects by stabilization of GATA6 and upregulation of SM-MHC and cell cycle inhibitors. Accordingly, TCF7L2 haploinsufficient mice exhibited increased susceptibility to, while mice overexpressing TCF7L2 were protected against injury-induced intimal hyperplasia compared to wildtype littermates. Consequently, the overexpression of TCF7L2 in LRP6 mutant mice rescued the injury induced intimal hyperplasia.

    "abstract": "Typically, multisensory illusion paradigms emphasise the importance of synchronous visuotactile integration to induce subjective embodiment towards another body. However, the extent to which embodiment is due to the  visual capture of congruent visuoproprioceptive information alone remains unclear. Thus, across two experiments (total N = 80), we investigated how mere visual observation of a mannequin body, viewed from a first-person perspective, influenced subjective embodiment independently from concomitant visuotactile integration. Moreover, we investigated whether slow, affective touch on participants own, unseen body (without concomitant touch on the seen mannequin) disrupted visual capture effects to a greater degree than fast, non-affective touch. In total, 40% of participants experienced subjective embodiment towards the mannequin body following mere visual observation, and this effect was significantly higher than conditions which included touch to participants own, unseen body. The velocity of the touch that participants received (affective/non-affective) did not differ in modulating visual capture effects. Furthermore, the effects of visual capture and perceived pleasantness of touch was not modulated by subthreshold eating disorder psychopathology. Overall, this study suggests that congruent visuoproprioceptive cues can be sufficient to induce subjective embodiment of a whole body, in the absence of visuotactile integration and beyond mere confabulatory responses.",

    "abstract": "Humans identify speech sounds, the fundamental building blocks of spoken language, using the same cues, or acoustic dimensions, as those that differentiate the voices of different speakers. The correct interpretation of speech cues is hence uncertain, and requires normalizing to the specific speaker. Here we assess how the human brain uses speaker-related contextual information to constrain the processing of speech cues. Using high-density electrocorticography, we recorded local neural activity from the cortical surface of participants who were engaged in a speech sound identification task. The speech sounds were preceded by speech from different speakers whose voices differed along the same acoustic dimension that differentiated the target speech sounds (the first formant; the lowest resonance frequency of the vocal tract). We found that the same acoustic speech sound tokens were perceived differently, and evoked different neural responses in auditory cortex, when they were heard in the context of different speakers. Such normalization involved the rescaling of acoustic-phonetic representations of speech, demonstrating a form of recoding before the signal is mapped onto phonemes or higher level linguistic units. This process is the result of auditory cortex sensitivity to the contrast between the dominant frequencies in speech sounds and those in their just preceding context. These findings provide important insights into the mechanistic implementation of normalization in human listeners. Moreover, they provide the first direct evidence of speaker-normalized speech sound representations in human parabelt auditory cortex, highlighting its critical role in resolving variability in sensory signals.",

    "abstract": "Rhizoctonia (in Greek \\\"root-killer\\\") species and particularly R. solani attacks a broad range of plant species and crops. It belongs to Basidiomycota and is a soil-borne pathogen causing mainly damping-off diseases of seedlings and root rot, although it can infect plants in any stage. Despite the severity of this disease, many aspects in R. solani infection biology still remain to be elucidated. Here we investigated the role of two effector candidates, predicted from the genome of a R. solani AG2-2IIIB strain that uses sugar beet as a host. Gene expression analysis showed that genes encoding for a LysM effector and a rare lipoprotein-A-like protein (RsRlpA) were induced upon early infection stages. When heterologous expressed in Cercospora beticola the two genes contributed to virulence. The RsLysM effector showed chitin- binding affinity and suppression of chitin-triggered immunity but could not protect hyphae from hydrolysis. The RsRlpA effector suppressed hypersensitive response in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Overall, this study provides us with valuable information on R. solani infection biology, implying that this organism relies on mechanisms similar to hemibiotrophic pathogens in order to establish a successful infection.",

    "abstract": "Killer yeasts are microorganisms, which can produce and secrete proteinaceous toxins, a characteristic gained via infection by a virus. These toxins are able to kill sensitive cells of the same or a related species. From a biotechnological perspective, killer yeasts have been considered as beneficial due to their antifungal/antimicrobial activity, but also regarded as problematic for large-scale fermentation processes, whereby those yeasts would kill species off starter cultures and lead to stuck fermentations. Here, we propose a mechanistic model of the toxin-binding kinetics pertaining to the killer population coupled with the toxin-induced death kinetics of the sensitive population to study toxic action in silico. Our deterministic model explains how killer Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells distress and consequently kill the sensitive members of the species, accounting for the K1, K2 and K28 toxin mode of action at high or low concentrations. The dynamic model captured the transient toxic activity starting from the introduction of killer cells into the culture at the time of inoculation through to induced cell death, and allowed us to gain novel insight on these mechanisms. The kinetics of K1/K2 activity via its primary pathway of toxicity was 5.5 times faster than its activity at low concentration inducing the apoptotic pathway in sensitive cells. Conversely, we showed that the primary pathway for K28 was approximately 3 times slower than its equivalent apoptotic pathway, indicating the particular relevance of K28 in biotechnological applications where the toxin concentration is rarely above those limits to trigger the primary pathway of killer activity.",

We present a method based on low-rank approximation which successfully replaces these dropouts (zero expression levels of unobserved expressed genes) by nonzero values, while preserving biologically non-expressed genes (true biological zeros) at zero expression levels. We validate our approach and compare it to two state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Apicomplexan parasites replicate within a protective organelle called the parasitophorous vacuole (PV). The Toxoplasma gondii PV is filled with a network of tubulated membranes, which are thought to facilitate trafficking of effectors and nutrients. Despite being critical to parasite virulence, there is scant mechanistic understanding of the networks functions. Here, we identify the parasite secreted kinase WNG1 as a critical regulator of tubular membrane biogenesis. WNG1 family members adopt an atypical protein kinase fold lacking the glycine rich ATP-binding loop that is required for catalysis in canonical kinases. Unexpectedly, we find that WNG1 is an active protein kinase that localizes to the PV lumen and phosphorylates PV-resident proteins, several of which are essential for the formation of a functional intravacuolar network. Moreover, we show that WNG1-dependent phosphorylation of these proteins is required for their membrane association, and thus their ability to tubulate membranes. Consequently, WNG1 knockout parasites have an aberrant PV membrane ultrastructure. Collectively, our results describe a unique family of Toxoplasma kinases and implicate phosphorylation of secreted proteins as a mechanism of regulating PV formation during parasite infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdvances in wildlife tracking technology have allowed researchers to understand the spatial ecology of many terrestrial and aquatic animal species. Argos Doppler is a technology that is widely used for wildlife tracking owing to the small size and low weight of the Argos transmitters. This allows them to be fitted to small-bodied species. The longer lifespan of the Argos units in comparison to units outfitted with miniaturized global positioning system (GPS) technology has also recommended their use. In practice, large Argos location errors often occur due to communication conditions such as transmitter settings, local environment, and the behavior of the tracked individual.\\n\\nMethodsConsidering the geographic specificity of errors and the lack of benchmark studies in Eastern Europe, the research objectives were: (1) to evaluate the accuracy of Argos Doppler technology under various environmental conditions in Romania, (2) to investigate the effectiveness of straightforward destructive filters for improving Argos Doppler data quality, and (3) to provide guidelines for processing Argos Doppler wildlife monitoring data. The errors associated with Argos locations in four geographic locations in Romania were assessed during static, low-speed and high-speed tests. The effectiveness of the Douglas Argos distance angle filter algorithm was then evaluated to ascertain its effect on the minimization of localization errors.\\n\\nResultsArgos locations received in the tests had larger associated horizontal errors than those indicated by the operator of the Argos system, including under ideal reception conditions. Positional errors were similar to those obtained in other studies outside of Europe. The errors were anisotropic, with larger longitudinal errors for the vast majority of the data. Errors were mostly related to speed of the Argos transmitter at the time of reception, but other factors such as topographical conditions and orientation of antenna at the time of the transmission also contributed to receiving low-quality data. The Douglas-Argos filter successfully excluded the largest errors while retaining a large amount of data when the threshold was set to the local scale (2 km).\\n\\nDiscussionFilter selection requires knowledge about the movement patterns and behavior of the species of interest, and the parametrization of the selected filter typically requires a trial and error approach. Selecting the proper filter reduces the errors while retaining a large amount of data. However, the post-processed data typically includes large positional errors; thus, we recommend incorporating Argos error metrics such as error ellipse or use complex modeling approaches when working with filtered data.",

We model microscopic interactions between individuals by using a dynamical payoff matrix and analyze the stochastic dynamics of such populations. New interactions drawn from invading mutants can drive the population away from the previous equilibrium, and lead to changes in the population size -- the population size is an evolving property rather than a fixed number or externally controlled variable. We present analytical results for the average population size over time and quantify the extinction risk of the population by the mean time to extinction.",

GxE can be important in applications ranging from basic functional genomics to precision medical treatment. Further, GxE effects elude inherently-linear LMMs and may explain missing heritability. We propose a simple, unifying mixed model for polygenic interactions (GxEMM) to capture the aggregate effect of small GxE effects spread across the genome. GxEMM extends existing LMMs for GxE in two important ways. First, it extends to arbitrary environmental variables, not just categorical groups. Second, GxEMM can estimate and test for environment-specific heritability. In simulations where the assumptions of existing methods do not hold, we show that GxEMM improves estimates of ordinary and GxE heritability and increases power to test for polygenic GxE. We then use GxEMM to prove that the heritability of major depression (MD) is reduced by stress, which we previously conjectured but could not prove with prior methods, and that a tail of polygenic GxE effects remains unexplained by MD GWAS.",

For all three CpG sites, linked to the genes TMEM49, BCL3 and MIR21, increased methylation related to an increase in CRP levels. Two CpGs (cg27023597 and cg12054453) were influenced by SNPs in genomic regions that had not previously been implicated in CRP GWASs, implicating them as novel genetic associations.\\n\\nOverall, our findings suggest that CRP associations with DNA methylation are more likely to be driven by either confounding or causal influences of DNA methylation on CRP levels, rather than the reverse.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial pathogens are increasingly evolving drug resistance under natural selection from antibiotics in medicine, agriculture, and nature. Meanwhile, bacteria ubiquitously encounter bacteriophages and can rapidly evolve phage resistance. However, the role of phages in interacting with drug-resistant and drug-sensitive bacteria remains unclear. To gain insight into such relationships, we screened for and characterized phages that rely on the multi-drug efflux pump gene tolC. First, we screened a collection of 33 environmental and commercial Escherichia coli phages for their ability to infect cells that lacked tolC. Our screen revealed two phages that had reduced efficiency of plating (EOP) on the tolC knockout compared to wild type. We further characterized these phages with bacterial growth curves, transmission electron microscopy, and analysis of phage-resistant mutants. Phage U136B is a curly-tailed virus in family Siphoviridae with no ability to infect a tolC knockout, suggesting TolC is the U136B receptor. Phage 132 is a contractile-tailed virus in family Myoviridae with reduced EOP on cells lacking ompF and its positive regulators tolC and ompR. U136B and 132 differentially effect bacterial growth and lysis, and U136B-resistant mutants contain mutations of the tolC gene. Together, these results show that the tolC gene involved in drug resistance can modify bacteria-phage interactions in multiple ways, altering bacterial lysis and selection. These new phages offer utility for studying evolution, tradeoffs, and infection mechanisms.\\n\\nImportanceBacteria face strong selection by antibiotics in medicine and agriculture, resulting in increasing levels of drug resistance among bacterial pathogens. Slowing this process will require an understanding of the environmental contexts in which drug resistance evolutionarily increases or decreases. In this study, we investigate two newly-isolated bacteriophages that rely on a bacterial antibiotic resistance gene. These bacteriophages vary in their interactions with drug-resistant bacteria, with one of the phages selecting for phage-resistant mutants that have mutations in the antibiotic resistance gene. Further study of these new phages will be useful to understanding evolutionary tradeoffs and how phages might be applied in natural settings to reverse the problem of drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Malnutrition remains a major health problem in low and middle income countries. During low protein intake, < 0.67 g/kg/day, there is a loss of nitrogen (N2) balance, due to the unavailability of amino acid for metabolism and unbalanced protein catabolism results. However, there are individuals, who consume the same low protein intake, and preserve N2 balance for unknown reasons. A novel factor, the gut microbiota, may account for these N2 balance differences. To investigate this, we correlated gut microbial profiles with the growth of four murine strains (C57Bl6/J, CD-1, FVB, and NIH-Swiss) on protein deficient (PD) diet. Results show that a PD diet exerts a strain-dependent impact on growth and N2 balance as determined through analysis of urinary urea, ammonia and creatinine excretion. Bacterial alpha diversity was significantly (p < 0.05, FDR) lower across all strains on a PD diet compared to normal chow (NC). Multi-group analyses of the composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) revealed significantly differential microbial signatures between the four strains independent of diet. However, mice on a PD diet demonstrated differential enrichment of bacterial genera including, Allobaculum (C57Bl6/J), Parabacteroides (CD-1), Turicibacter (FVB), and Mucispirillum (NIH-Swiss) relative to NC. Additionally, statistical model fitting revealed that the relative abundance of genera such as Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, and Lactobacillus were significantly positively correlated with body weight, while Anaerofustis, Roseburia, and Bilophila were significantly positively correlated with ammonia excretion. Taken together, these results suggest a potential relationship between the specific gut microbiota, N2 balance and animal response to malnutrition.",

    "abstract": "Neurofeedback (NF) allows to exert self-regulation over specific aspects of ones own brain activity by returning information extracted in real-time from brain activity measures. These measures are usually acquired from a single modality, most commonly electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). EEG-fMRI-neurofeedback (EEG-fMRI-NF) is a new approach that consists in providing a NF based simultaneously on EEG and fMRI signals. By exploiting the complementarity of these two modalities, EEG-fMRI-NF opens a new spectrum of possibilities for defining bimodal NF targets that could be more robust, flexible and effective than unimodal ones. Since EEG-fMRI-NF allows for a richer amount of information to be fed back, the question arises of how to represent the EEG and fMRI features simultaneously in order to allow the subject to achieve better self-regulation. In this work, we propose to represent EEG and fMRI features in a single bimodal feedback (integrated feedback). We introduce two integrated feedback strategies for EEG-fMRI-NF and compare their early effects on a motor imagery task with a between-group design. The BiDim group (n=10) was shown a two-dimensional (2D) feedback in which each dimension depicted the information from one modality. The UniDim group (n=10) was shown a one-dimensional (1D) feedback that integrated both types of information even further by merging them into one. Online fMRI activations were significantly higher in the UniDim group than in the BiDim group, which suggests that the 1D feedback is easier to control than the 2D feedback. However subjects from the BiDim group produced more specific BOLD activations with a notably stronger activation in the right superior parietal lobe (BiDim > UniDim, p < 0.001, uncorrected). These results suggest that the 2D feedback encourages subjects to explore their strategies to recruit more specific brain patterns. To summarize, our study shows that 1D and 2D integrated feedbacks are effective but also appear to be complementary and could therefore be used in a bimodal NF training program. Altogether, our study paves the way to novel integrated feedback strategies for the development of flexible and effective bimodal NF paradigms that fully exploits bimodal information and are adapted to clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to identify a global and robust signature characterizing Alzheimers Disease (AD). Two public GWAS datasets were analyzed considering a 3-fold kernel approach, based on SNPs, Genes and Pathways analysis, and two binary classifications tasks were addressed: cases@controls and APOE4 task. In the SNP signature of the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets, chromosome 19 and 20 reached high classification accuracy. In addition, the functional characterization of ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 SNP signatures found enriched the same pathway (i.e., Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction), with GRM7 gene in common with both. TOMM40 was confirmed linked to AD pathology by SNP, gene and pathway-based analyses in ADNI-1. Using this 3-fold kernel approach, a peculiar signature of SNPs, genes and pathways has been highlighted in both datasets. Based on these significant results, we retain such approach a valuable tool to elucidate the heritable susceptibility to AD but also to other similar complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "Unlike the living elephants, which live in warm tropical and subtropical habitats, mammoths lived in extreme cold environments where average winter temperatures ranged from -30{degrees} to -50{degrees}C. Like other cold adapted and artic species, mammoths evolved of suite of morphological and molecular adaptations that facilitated life in the cold. Here we reanalyze mammoth genomes and find that genes with mammoth-specific amino acid substitutions are enriched in functions related to temperature sensation. Among the genes with mammoth-specific amino acid substitutions is TRPM8, which mediates sensitivity to nonnoxious cool temperatures from 25- 28{degrees}C and cooling sensations induced by the chemical agonists menthol and icilin. We find that TRPM8 evolved rapidly in the mammoth stem-lineage, likely because of an episode of relaxed purifying selection. Functional characterization of resurrected mammoth and ancestral TRPM8 indicates that the mammoth TRPM8 is desensitized to cold but maintains sensitivity to menthol and icilin. These data suggest that as mammoths evolved into a cold tolerant species they lost the need for a cold-sensitive TRPM8.",

    "abstract": "The cosynthesis of DNA and RNA potentially generates conflicts between replication and transcription, which can lead to genomic instability. In trypanosomatids, eukaryotic parasites that perform polycistronic transcription, this phenomenon and its consequences have not yet been investigated. Here, using equations and computational analysis we demonstrated that the number of constitutive origins mapped in the Trypanosoma brucei genome is close to the minimum required to complete replication within S phase duration. However, taking into account the location of these origins in the genome, the replication in due time becomes virtually impossible, making it necessary to activate non-constitutive origins. Moreover, computational and biological assays pointed to transcription being responsible for activating non-constitutive origins. Together, our results suggest that transcription action through conflicts with replication contributes to the firing of non-constitutive origins, maintaining the robustness of S phase duration. The usage of this entire pool of origins seems to be of paramount importance for the survival of this parasite that infects million people around the world since it contributes to the maintenance of the replication of its DNA.",

Nevertheless, there are no data regarding the impact of ELT on affective phenomenology and whether these pathways are mediated by staging or lowered lipid-associated antioxidant defences.\\n\\nMethodsThis study examined healthy controls (n=54) and patients with affective disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders (n=118). ELT was assessed using the Child Trauma Questionnaire. In addition, we measured affective phenomenology and assayed advanced oxidation protein products; malondialdehyde, paraoxonase 1 (CMPAase) activity, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.\\n\\nResultsELT was associated with increased risk for mood and comorbid anxiety disorders and a more severe phenomenology, including staging characteristics (number of mood episodes), severity of depression and anxiety, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, type of treatments received, disabilities, body mass index, smoking behaviour and hsCRP, as well as lowered health-related quality of life, socio-economic status, antioxidant defences and semantic memory. The number of mood episodes and CMPAase/HDL-cholesterol levels could be reliably combined into a new vulnerability staging-biomarker index, which mediates in part the effects of ELT on affective phenomenology, while lowered antioxidant defences are associated with increased oxidative stress. Moreover, the effects of female sex on mood disorders and affective phenomenology are mediated by ELT.\\n\\nDiscussionThe cumulative effects of different types of ELT drive many aspects of affective phenomenology either directly or indirectly through effects of staging and/or lipid-associated antioxidant defences. The results show that children, especially girls, with ELT are at great risk to develop mood disorders and more severe phenotypes of affective disorders.",

Allometric scaling laws have been used to overcome this problem. However, most existing models rely upon small sample sizes, geographically restricted sampling and have limited applicability for non-bee taxa. Predictive allometric models that consider biogeography, phylogenetic relatedness and intraspecific variation are urgently required to ensure greater accuracy.\\nC_LIO_LIHere, we measured body size, as dry weight, and intertegular distance (ITD) of 391 bee species (4035 specimens) and 103 hoverfly species (399 specimens) across four biogeographic regions: Australia, Europe, North America and South America. We updated existing models within a Bayesian mixed-model framework to test the power of ITD to predict interspecific variation in pollinator dry weight in interaction with different co-variates: phylogeny or taxonomy, sexual dimorphism and biogeographic region. In addition, we used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to assess intraspecific dry weight - ITD relationships for 10 bee and five hoverfly species.\\nC_LIO_LIIncluding co-variates led to more robust interspecific body size predictions for both bees (Bayesian R2: 0.946; {Delta}R2 0.047) and hoverflies (Bayesian R2: 0.821; {Delta}R2 0.058) relative to models with ITD alone. In contrast, at the intraspecific level, our results demonstrate that ITD is an inconsistent predictor of body size for bees (R2: 0.02 - 0.66) and hoverflies (R2: -0.11 - 0.44).\\nC_LIO_LITherefore, predictive allometry is more suitable for interspecific comparative analyses than assessing intraspecific variation.

    "abstract": "Birds inhabit a variety of habitats and they communicate using primarily visual and acoustic signals; two central hypotheses have been postulated to study the evolution of such a signals. The sensory drive hypothesis posits that variation in the physical properties of habitats leads to variation in natural selection pressures by affecting the ease with which different types of signals are perceived. Assuming that resources are limited for animals, the transfer hypothesis predicts a negative relationship between the investments in different types of signals. We evaluated these two hypotheses in a tropical montane forest bird assemblage. We also postulate a possible interaction between these two hypotheses: we predicted that the negative relationships between signals should be observed only when jointly considering birds from different environments (e.g. understory and canopy) due to the expected differences in communication strategies between habitats. The sensory drive hypothesis was supported by the differences we found between strata in vocal output, patch contrast to background and color conspicuousness, but not for the variables associated to song elaboration and hue disparity. We found support for the transfer hypothesis: birds with colors contrasting less against the background sing more frequently and birds with lower diversity of colors produce longer songs, understory birds showed also a negative relationship between signals, but only when accounting for phylogeny. We found partial support for the interaction between the sensory drive and the transfer hypotheses: hue disparity and vocal output were negatively related only when analyzing together birds from the canopy and the understory, but not when analyzing them separately. We conclude that the study of the evolution of communication signals needs to consider more than one channel and the functional interactions between them. The results of the interaction of optimal signaling strategies in two communication channels in the local habitats where animals signaling, are the patterns of colors and songs we revealed in a tropical montane forest bird assemblage.",

We further identified A1CFs RNA binding targets using enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation sequencing of cultured HepG2 cells and investigated pathways enriched for these targets. Transcriptomic effects of A1CF deficiency were evaluated through RNA sequencing and analyses for differential expression, alternative splicing, and RNA editing.\\n\\nResultsBoth A1cf -/-and A1cfGS/GS mice exhibited increased fasting plasma TG, establishing that the TG phenotype is due to A1CF loss of function. In vivo TG secretion and clearance studies revealed increased TG secretion without changes in clearance in A1cf -/-mice. Increased VLDL-apoB secretion was also seen in A1cf -/-rat hepatoma cells, but no increase in apoB synthesis was observed. This phenotype was seen without significant shifts in apoB-100/apoB-48 in A1CF deficiency. To discover novel pathways for A1CFs role in TG metabolism, we identified A1CFs RNA binding targets, which were enriched for pathways related to proteasomal catabolism and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Indeed, proteasomal inhibition led to increased cellular stress in A1cf -/-cells, and higher expression of ER-stress protein GRP78 was observed in resting A1cf -/-cells. RNA-seq of whole livers from wild-type and A1cf -/-mice revealed that pro-inflammatory, not lipogenesis, genes were upregulated as a secondary effect of A1CF deficiency. Differential alternative splicing (AS) analysis and RNA editing analysis revealed that genes involved in cellular stress and metabolism underwent differential changes in A1CF deficiency, and top A1CF binding target proteins with relevance to intracellular stress were differentially expressed on the protein but not mRNA level, implicating multiple mechanisms by which A1CF influences TG secretion.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data suggest an important role for A1CF in mediating VLDL-TG secretion through regulating intracellular stress.",

    "abstract": "Simarteviruses (Arteriviridae: Simartevirus) are commonly found at high titers in the blood of African monkeys but do not cause overt disease in these hosts. In contrast, simarteviruses cause severe disease in Asian macaques upon accidental or experimental transmission. Here, we sought to better understand the host-dependent drivers of simartevirus pathogenesis by infecting olive baboons (n=4) and rhesus macaques (n=4) with the simartevirus Southwest baboon virus 1 (SWBV-1). Surprisingly, none of the animals in our study showed signs of disease following SWBV-1 inoculation. Three animals (two rhesus monkeys and one olive baboon) became infected and sustained high levels of SWBV-1 viremia for the duration of the study. The course of SWBV-1 infection was highly predictable: plasma viremia peaked between 1x107 and 1x108 vRNA copies/ml at 3-10 days post-inoculation, which was followed by a relative nadir and then establishment of a stable set-point between 1x106 and 1x107 vRNA copies/ml for the remainder of the study (56 days). We characterized cellular and antibody responses to SWBV-1 infection in these animals, demonstrating that macaques and baboons mount similar responses to SWBV-1 infection, yet these responses are ineffective at clearing SWBV-1 infection. SWBV-1 sequencing revealed the accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in a region of the genome that corresponds to an immunodominant epitope in the simartevirus major envelope glycoprotein GP5, which likely contribute to viral persistence by enabling escape from host antibodies.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummarySimartevirus infection has multiple disease manifestations following cross-species transmission.\\n\\nAccessible Summary/ImportanceSimarteviruses are known to infect African monkeys, such as olive baboons, without causing overt disease. In contrast, accidental infection of Asian monkeys, such as rhesus monkeys, has resulted in severe and often fatal disease. We used a simartevirus found circulating among captive olive baboons (Southwest baboon virus 1; SWBV-1) to experimentally infect both olive baboons and rhesus monkeys to model infection with the same virus in both natural and non-natural hosts. Surprisingly, neither baboons nor macaques displayed any laboratory abnormalities or signs of disease over the course of infection, despite robust SWBV-1 replication. In the accompanying study by Cornish et al., a similar experimental approach was undertaken: African patas monkeys and rhesus monkeys were infected with the simartevirus simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). In contrast to our study, SHFV caused disease in both of these hosts, albeit with much more severe disease developing in the macaques. Interestingly, we observed similar levels of immune cell activation in simartevirus-infected animals across both studies, suggesting that finer nuances of the host response, and perhaps properties of each individual simartevirus, may influences pathogenicity of these viruses in primates. Taken together, our collective findings highlight the wide clinical spectrum of simartevirus infection, ranging from highly-lethal hemorrhagic disease to persistent infection without any overt signs of disease, even in non-natural primate hosts.",

The roots have the most contributions for their resiliency and therefore can be inspired for future manmade structures. The motion of water in riverine mangrove forest is expected to be impacted by mangrove roots, which in turn disturb the transport of nutrients, contaminants, and residues in these systems. In this paper, a facile method for protecting shoreline is described and review and the significant impact of this method were reviewed. Bioinspired simplified models as and obstruction to water currents in shorelines, and coastal areas are presented. It was found that Mangrove roots produce complex flow structure interactions with their environment, which affect the nutrient, habitat and aquatic animals. Analysis of the flow structure behind the roots extend to a broad range of mangrove-inspired applications and provide understandings into flows that are more complex and more indicative of the flows encountered in the unidirectional riverine flow.",

To close this gap, we generated the first in vivo map of miRNA::mRNA interactions in Drosophila melanogaster, making use of crosslinked nucleotides in Argonaute (AGO) crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) experiments that enable an unambiguous assignment of miRNAs to AGO binding sites at much higher signal-to-noise ratio than computational predictions alone.\\n\\nAbsolute quantification of cellular miRNA levels showed the miRNA pool in Drosophila cell lines to be more diverse than previously reported. Benchmarking two different CLIP approaches, we identified a similar predictive potential to unambiguously assign thousands of miRNA::mRNA pairs from AGO1 interaction data at unprecedented depth. Quantitative RNA-Seq and subcodon-resolution ribosomal footprinting data upon AGO1 depletion enabled the determination of miRNA-mediated effects on target expression and translation. We thus provide the first comprehensive resource of miRNA target sites as well as their quantitative functional impact in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Human-induced rapid environmental change (HIREC) has recently led to alterations in the fitness and behavior of many organisms. Game theory is an important tool of behavioral ecology for analyzing evolutionary situations involving multiple individuals. However, game theory bypasses the details by which behavioral phenotypes are determined, taking the functional perspective straight from expected payoffs to predicted frequencies of behaviors. In contrast with optimization approaches, we identify that to use existing game theoretic models to predict HIREC effects, additional mechanistic details (or assumptions) will often be required. We illustrate this in relation to the hawk-dove game by showing that three different mechanisms, each of which support the same ESS prior to HIREC (fixed polymorphism, probabilistic choice, or cue dependency), can have a substantial effect on behavior (and success) following HIREC. Surprisingly, an increase in the value of resources can lead to a reduction in payoffs (and vice versa), both in the immediate- and long-term following HIREC. An increase in expected costs also increases expected payoffs. Along with these counter-intuitive findings, this work shows that simply understanding the behavioral payoffs of existing games is insufficient to make predictions about the effects of HIREC.\\n\\nIts the little details that are vital.

    "abstract": "Targeted DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) with CRISPR-Cas9 have revolutionized genetic modification by enabling efficient genome editing in a broad range of eukaryotic systems. Accurate gene editing is possible with near-perfect efficiency in haploid or (predominantly) homozygous genomes. However, genomes exhibiting polyploidy and/or high degrees of heterozygosity are less amenable to genetic modification. Here, we report an up to 99-fold lower gene editing efficiency when editing individual heterozygous loci in the yeast genome. Moreover, Cas9-mediated introduction of a DSB resulted in large scale loss of heterozygosity affecting DNA regions up to 360 kb that resulted in introduction of nearly 1700 off-target mutations, due to replacement of sequences on the targeted chromosome by corresponding sequences from its non-targeted homolog. The observed patterns of loss of heterozygosity were consistent with homology directed repair. The extent and frequency of loss of heterozygosity represent a novel mutagenic side-effect of Cas9-mediated genome editing, which would have to be taken into account in eukaryotic gene editing. In addition to contributing to the limited genetic amenability of heterozygous yeasts, Cas9-mediated loss of heterozygosity could be particularly deleterious for human gene therapy, as loss of heterozygous functional copies of anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic genes is a known path to cancer.",

In fact, traditional scientific approaches with intense focus on individual genes or proteins have not been successful in providing new treatments. Hence, innovations in technology and computational methods provide new tools to further understand complex biological systems such as pathogens biology. In this work, we propose a system biology approach to analyze transcriptomic data of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. By means of an optimization procedure, the phenotypic transitions between the stages associated with the life cycle of the parasite were embedded into the dynamics of a gene network model. Thus, through this methodology we were able to reconstruct a gene regulatory network able to emulate the life cycle of the pathogen. The community network analysis has revealed that nodes of the network can be organized in seven communities which allow us to assign putative functions to 339 previously uncharacterized genes, 25 of which are predicted as new pathogenic factors. Furthermore, we identified a small subnetwork module that controls the parasites life cycle. These new findings can contribute to understand of parasite pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Cell differentiation and cell fate determination in sensory systems are essential for stimulus discrimination and coding of environmental stimuli. Color vision is based on the differential color sensitivity of retinal photoreceptors, however the developmental programs that control photoreceptor cell differentiation and specify color sensitivity are poorly understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, there is evidence that the color sensitivity of different photoreceptors in the compound eye is regulated by inductive signals between cells, but the exact nature of these signals and how they are propagated remains unknown. We conducted a genetic screen to identify additional regulators of this process and identified a novel mutation in the hibris gene. hibris encodes an irre cell recognition module protein (IRM). These immunoglobulin super family cell adhesion molecules include human neph and nephrin (NPHS1). hibris is expressed dynamically in the developing Drosophila melanogaster eye and loss-of-function mutations give rise to a diverse range of mutant phenotypes including disruption of the specification of R8 photoreceptors cell diversity. The specification of blue or green sensitivity in R8 cells is also dependent upon Notch signaling. We demonstrate that hibris is required within the retina, non-cell autonomously for these effects, suggesting an additional layer of complexity in the signaling process that produces paired expression of opsin genes in adjacent R7 and R8 photoreceptor cells.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAs humans, our ability to distinguish different colors is dependent upon the presence of three different types of cone cell neurons in the retina of the eye. The cone cells express blue, green or red absorbing visual pigments that detect and discriminate between these colors. The principle of color discrimination by neurons \\\"tuned\\\" to different colors is an evolutionarily conserved specialization that occurs in many different animals. This specialization requires 1) visual pigments that detect different colors and 2) a developmental program that regulates the expression of these pigments in different types of cells. In this study we discovered that the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) gene hibris is required for the developmental program that produces blue sensitive neurons in the fly retina. When we over-expressed hibris throughout the developing retina, extra blue sensitive cells were produced. These results demonstrate that if there is not enough hibris, too few blue sensitive cells form, but if there is too much hibris, too many blue sensitive cells form. Finally, we discovered that the hibris gene does not act in color sensitive neurons of the retina themselves. This surprising discovery suggests that hibris may influence development of the retina in a completely new and different way.",

Neuroimaging investigations have revealed that lip-reading activates auditory cortices in individuals covertly repeating absent--but known--speech. However, in real-life, one usually has no detailed information about the content of upcoming speech. Here we show that during silent lip-reading of unknown speech, activity in auditory cortices entrains more to absent speech than to seen lip movements at frequencies below 1 Hz. This entrainment to absent speech was characterized by a speech-to-brain delay of 50-100 ms as when actually listening to speech. We also observed entrainment to lip movements at the same low frequency in the right angular gyrus, an area involved in processing biological motion. These findings demonstrate that the brain can synthesize high-level features of absent unknown speech sounds from lip-reading that can facilitate the processing of the auditory input. Such a synthesis process may help explain well-documented bottom-up perceptual effects.",

    "abstract": "Studies examining relationships between genotypic and phenotypic variation have historically been carried out on people of European ancestry. Efforts are underway to address this limitation, but until they succeed, the legacy of a Euro-centric bias will continue to hinder research, including the use of polygenic scores, which are individual-level metrics of genetic risk. Ongoing debate surrounds the generalizability of polygenic scores based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted in European ancestry samples, to non-European ancestry samples. We analyzed the first decade of polygenic scoring studies (2008-2017, inclusive), and found that 67% of studies included exclusively European ancestry participants and another 19% included only East Asian ancestry participants. Only 3.8% of studies were carried out on samples of African, Hispanic, or Indigenous peoples. We find that effect sizes for European ancestry-derived polygenic scores are only 36% as large in African ancestry samples, as in European ancestry samples (t=-10.056, df=22, p=5.5x10-10). Analyzing global populations, we show that relationships between height polygenic scores and height are highly dependent on methodological choices in polygenic score construction, highlighting the need for caution in interpreting population level differences in distributions of polygenic scores, as currently calculated. These findings bolster the rationale for large-scale GWAS in diverse human populations and highlight the need for better handling of linkage disequilibrium and variant frequencies when applying scores to non-European samples.",

    "abstract": "Summary statementWe developed a machine vision technique for markerless tracking of locomotion in the spider Dolomedes aquaticus. Gait analysis suggests that each pair of legs plays a specific role in locomotion.\\n\\nAbstractBecause of their rigid exoskeleton with relatively simple joint mechanics, arthropods can provide useful models for studying the sensory-neural and mechanical design principles of agile animal locomotion. Gait analysis usually requires attaching markers or manually identifying reference points in video frames, which can be time consuming and inaccurate, especially with small animals. Here we describe a markerless motion capture technique and its application to gait analysis in the New Zealand semi-aquatic hunting spider, Dolomedes aquaticus. Our machine vision approach uses a model of the spiders skeleton to infer the location of the centre of mass and the configuration of the skeleton in successive video frames. We found that stride length and frequency are correlated with running speed. Inter-limb coordination during the gait cycle suggests that different legs have specialized roles in locomotion. Phase relationships among the six hindmost legs exhibit an alternating tripod gait, as in hexapod insects. The middle two leg pairs appear to be primarily responsible for generating thrust, while the hind legs contribute more to stability. The front legs are not phase-coupled to the other legs and appear to be used as tactile probes during locomotion. Our machine vision approach has the potential to automate arthropod gait analysis, making it faster and easier. Our results indicate how specialization of limb function may contribute to locomotor efficiency and agility of a specialized hunting spider, and how arthropod design principles may contribute to developing efficient, agile legged robots.",

Several factors contribute to this issue, including the use of small samples in neuroimaging research and heterogeneity within diagnostic categories. Here, we aimed to investigate differences in functional brain network integrity between traditional diagnostic categories (autism spectrum disorder [ASD], attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], typically developing [TD]) and carefully consider the impact of comorbid ASD and ADHD on functional brain network integrity in a large sample. We also assess the neurobiological validity of a novel, potential alternative nosology based on behavioral measures of executive function.\\n\\nMethodFive-minute resting-state fMRI data were obtained from 168 children (128 boys, 40 girls) with ASD, ADHD, comorbid ASD and ADHD, and TD children. Independent component analysis and dual regression were used to compute within- and between-network functional connectivity metrics at the individual level.\\n\\nResultsNo significant group differences in within- nor between-network functional connectivity were observed between traditional diagnostic categories (ASD, ADHD, TD) even when stratified by comorbidity (ASD+ADHD, ASD, ADHD, TD). Similarly, subgroups classified by executive functioning levels showed no group differences.\\n\\nConclusionsUsing clinical diagnosis and behavioral measures of executive function, no group differences were observed among the categories examined. Therefore, we suggest that brain imaging metrics may more effectively define clinical subgroups than behavioral metrics, and may contribute to the establishment of a neurobiologically valid nosology for neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "In complex biological systems, simple individual-level behavioral rules can give rise to emergent group-level behavior. While such collective behavior has been well studied in cells and larger organisms, the mesoscopic scale is less understood, as it is unclear which sensory inputs and physical processes matter a priori. Here, we investigate collective feeding in the roundworm C. elegans at this intermediate scale, using quantitative phenotyping and agent-based modeling to identify behavioral rules underlying both aggregation and swarming--a dynamic phenotype only observed at longer timescales. Using fluorescent multi-worm tracking, we quantify aggregation behavior in terms of individual dynamics and population-level statistics. Based on our quantification, we use agent-based simulations and approximate Bayesian inference to identify three key behavioral rules that give rise to aggregation: cluster-edge reversals, a density-dependent switch between crawling speeds, and taxis towards neighboring worms. Our simulations suggest that swarming is simply driven by local food depletion but otherwise employs the same behavioral mechanisms as the initial aggregation. Hence, mesoscopic C. elegans uses mechanisms familiar from microscopic systems for aggregation, but implemented via more complex behaviors characteristic of macroscopic organisms.",

By comparing our results with mammalian data, we find a significant enrichment for positively selected genes shared between taxa, and that these shared selected genes are enriched for viral immune pathways. Using pathogen-challenge transcriptome data, we show that genes up-regulated in response to pathogens are also enriched for positively selected genes.

    "abstract": "The resolution of the Tree of Life has accelerated with advances in DNA sequencing technology. To achieve dense sampling, it is often necessary to obtain DNA from historical museum specimens to supplement modern genetic samples. However, DNA from historical material is generally degraded and fragmented, which presents various challenges. In this study, we evaluated how the coverage at variant sites and missing data among historical and modern sample types impacts phylogenomic inference. We explored these patterns in the brush-tongued parrots (lories and lorikeets) of Australasia by sampling ultraconserved elements in 105 taxa. Trees estimated with low coverage sites had several clades where historical or modern samples clustered together, which were not observed in trees with more stringent filtering. To assess if the aberrant relationships were affected by missing data, we performed a targeted outlier analysis of sites and loci and a more general data reduction approach where we excluded sites based on a percentage of data completeness. The outlier analyses showed that 6.6% of total sites were driving the topological differences among trees built with and without low coverage sites, and at these sites, historical samples had 7.5x more missing data than modern ones. An examination of subclades identified loci biased by missing data, and the exclusion of these loci shifted phylogenetic relationships. Predictive modeling found that outlier analysis scores were not correlated with summary statistics of locus alignments, indicating that outlier loci do not have characteristics differing from other loci. Excluding missing data by percentage completeness indicated that sites with 70% completeness were necessary to avoid spurious relationships, but more stringent conditions of data completeness produced less-resolved trees. After accounting for biased loci and understanding the stability of relationships, we inferred a more robust phylogenetic hypothesis for lories and lorikeets.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death both in men and women. Tumor heterogeneity is an impediment to targeted treatment of all cancers, including lung cancer. Here, we sought to characterize changes in tumor proteome and phosphoproteome by longitudinal, prospective collection of tumor tissue of an exceptional responder lung adenocarcinoma patient who survived with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma for more than seven years with HER2-directed therapy in combination with chemotherapy. We employed \\\"Super-SILAC\\\" and TMT labeling strategies to quantify the proteome and phosphoproteome of a lung metastatic site and ten different metastatic progressive lymph nodes collected across a span of seven years, including five lymph nodes procured at autopsy. We identified specific signaling networks enriched in lung compared to the lymph node metastatic sites. We correlated the changes in protein abundance with changes in copy number alteration (CNA) and transcript expression. To further interrogate the mass spectrometry data, patient-specific database was built incorporating all the somatic variants identified by whole genome sequencing (WGS) of genomic DNA from the lung, one lymph node metastatic site and blood. An extensive validation pipeline was built for confirmation of variant peptides. We validated 360 spectra corresponding to 55 germline and 6 somatic variant peptides. Targeted MRM assays demonstrated expression of two novel variant somatic peptides, CDK12-G879V and FASN-R1439Q, with expression in lung and lymph node metastatic sites, respectively. CDK12 G879V mutation likely results in a nonfunctional CDK12 kinase and chemotherapy susceptibility in lung metastatic sites. Knockdown of CDK12 in lung adenocarcinoma cells results in increased chemotherapy sensitivity, explaining the complete resolution of the lung metastatic sites in this patient.",
