    "abstract": "RNA genetic circuitry is emerging as a powerful tool to control gene expression. However, little work has been done to create a theoretical foundation for RNA circuit design. A prerequisite to this is a quantitative modeling framework that accurately describes the dynamics of RNA circuits. In this work, we develop an ordinary differential equation model of transcriptional RNA genetic circuitry, using an RNA cascade as a test case. We show that parameter sensitivity analysis can be used to design a set of four simple experiments that can be performed in parallel using rapid cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) reactions to determine the thirteen parameters of the model. The resulting model accurately recapitulates the dynamic behavior of the cascade, and can be easily extended to predict the function of new cascade variants that utilize new elements with limited additional characterization experiments. Interestingly, we show that inconsistencies between model predictions and experiments led to the model-guided discovery of a previously unknown maturation step required for RNA regulator function. We also determine circuit parameters in two different batches of TX-TL, and show that batch-to-batch variation can be attributed to differences in parameters that are directly related to the concentrations of core gene expression machinery. We anticipate the RNA circuit models developed here will inform the creation of computer aided genetic circuit design tools that can incorporate the growing number of RNA regulators, and that the parameterization method will find use in determining functional parameters of a broad array of natural and synthetic regulatory systems.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=132 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/018358_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (17K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eace4dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8e2757org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b8f454org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b0cfc9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Identifying whether potential causal variants for related diseases are shared can increase understanding of the shared etiology between diseases. Colocalization methods are designed to disentangle shared and distinct causal variants in regions where two diseases show association, but existing methods are limited by assuming independent datasets. We extended existing methods to allow for the shared control design common in GWAS and applied them to four autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes (T1D); rheumatoid arthritis; celiac disease (CEL) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Ninety regions associated with at least one disease. In 22 regions (24%), we identify association to precisely one of our four diseases and can find no published association of any other disease to the same region; some of these may reflect effects mediated by the target of immune attack. Thirty-three regions (37%) were associated with two or more, but in 14 of these there was evidence that causal variants differed between diseases. By leveraging information across datasets, we identified novel disease associations to 12 regions previously associated with one or more of the other three autoimmune disorders. For instance, we link the CEL-associated FASLG region to T1D and identify a single SNP, rs78037977, as a likely causal variant. We also highlight several particularly complex association patterns, including the CD28-CTLA4-ICOS region, in which it appears that three distinct causal variants associate with three diseases in three different patterns. Our results underscore the complexity in genetic variation underlying related but distinct autoimmune diseases and help to approach its dissection.",

    "abstract": "Some group-living species exhibit social immunity, where the immune system of one individual can protect others in the group from infection. In burying beetles this is part of parental care. Larvae feed on vertebrate carcasses which their parents smear with exudates that inhibit microbial growth. We have sequenced the transcriptome of the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides and identified six genes that encode lysozymes - a type of antimicrobial enzyme that has previously been implicated in social immunity in burying beetles. When females start breeding and producing antimicrobial anal exudates, we found that the expression of one of these genes was increased by [~]1000 times to become one of the most abundant transcripts in the transcriptome. We conclude that we have likely identified a gene for social immunity, and that it was recruited during evolution from a previous function in personal immunity.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) recognize small DNA sequence motifs directly or through their sequence-dependent structure. While sequence composition and degeneracy are verified to be the defining factors of TF binding specificity, the role of conformational dynamics of the DNA remains poorly understood. With growing evidence from next generation sequencing (NGS) data suggesting the inadequacy of sequence-only models, alternative models for describing the TF binding preferences are required, wherein the conformational dynamics presents an attractive option. Here, we report a novel method (DynaSeq) which accurately predicts DNA-conformational ensembles for genomic targets of TFs. Using DynaSeq we demonstrate how the dynamics of binding sites and their distal flanking regions can be used to elucidate TF-binding patterns for two model systems: cell type-specific binding of STAT3 and chromatin structural specificity of 3 functional TF classes viz. pioneers, settlers and migrants. We find that TF preferences in both these systems can be accurately explained by the conformational dynamics of their binding sites and their distal flanking DNA regions. Conformational dynamics not only distinguishes binding sites from genomic backgrounds in STAT3; it also points to a modular organization of their surrounding regions. Further, the differential binding modes of STAT3-DNA reveal a potential mechanism of cellular specificity. Our model identifies clear signatures to accurately classify pioneer, migrant and settler TF targets from the dynamics of distal flanking regions. This suggests that the chromatin preferences of TFs are significantly influenced by the intrinsic conformational dynamics of the DNA surrounding the TF binding sites.",

    "abstract": "A central goal of synthetic biology is to design sophisticated synthetic cellular circuits that can perform complex computations and information processing tasks in response to specific inputs. The tremendous advances in our ability to understand and manipulate cellular information processing networks raises several fundamental physics questions: How do the molecular components of cellular circuits exploit energy consumption to improve information processing? Can one utilize ideas from thermodynamics to improve the design of synthetic cellular circuits and modules? Here, we summarize recent theoretical work addressing these questions. Energy consumption in cellular circuits serves five basic purposes: (1) increasing specificity, (2) manipulating dynamics, (3) reducing variability, (4) amplifying signal, and (5) erasing memory. We demonstrate these ideas using several simple examples and discuss the implications of these theoretical ideas for the emerging field of synthetic biology. We conclude by discussing how it may be possible to overcome these limitations using \\\"post-translational\\\" synthetic biology that exploits reversible protein modification.",

    "abstract": "Critics of significance testing claim that this statistical framework promotes discrepancies by using arbitrary thresholds () to impose reject/accept dichotomies on continuous data, which is not reflective of the biological reality of quantitative phenotypes. Here we explore this idea and evaluate an alternative approach, demonstrating the potential for meta-analysis and related estimation methods to resolve discordance generated by the use of traditional significance tests. We selected a set of behavioral studies proposing differing models of the physiological basis of Drosophila olfactory memory and used systematic review and meta-analysis approaches to define the true role of lobular specialization within the brain. The mainstream view is that each of the three lobes of the Drosophila mushroom body play specialized roles in short-term aversive olfactory memory [1-5], but a number of studies have made divergent conclusions based on their discordant experimental findings [6-8]. Multivariate meta-regression models revealed that short-term memory lobular specialization is not in fact supported by the data, and identified the cellular extent of a transgenic driver as the major predictor of its effect on short-term memory. Our findings demonstrate that meta-analysis, meta-regression, hierarchical models and estimation methods in general can be successfully harnessed to identify knowledge gaps, synthesize divergent results, accommodate heterogeneous experimental design and quantify genetic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Natural products have provided humans with antibiotics for millennia. However, a decline in the pace of chemical discovery exerts pressure on human health as antibiotic resistance spreads. The empirical nature of current genome mining approaches used for natural products research limits the chemical space that is explored. By integration of evolutionary concepts related to emergence of metabolism, we have gained fundamental insights that are translated into an alternative genome mining approach, termed EvoMining. As the founding assumption of EvoMining is the evolution of enzymes, we solved two milestone problems revealing unprecedented conversions. First, we report the biosynthetic gene cluster of the  orphan metabolite leupeptin in Streptomyces roseus. Second, we discover an enzyme involved in formation of an arsenic-carbon bond in Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces lividans. This work provides evidence that bacterial chemical repertoire is underexploited, as well as an approach to accelerate the discovery of novel antibiotics from bacterial genomes.",
