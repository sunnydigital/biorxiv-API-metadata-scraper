    "abstract": "O_LIAcross plants, leaves exhibit profound diversity in shape. As a single leaf expands, its shape is in constant flux. Plants may also produce leaves with different shapes at successive nodes. Additionally, leaf shape varies among individuals, populations, and species due to evolutionary processes and environmental influences.\\nC_LIO_LIBecause leaf shape can vary in many different ways, theoretically the effects of distinct developmental and evolutionary processes are separable, even within the shape of a single leaf. Here, we measure the shapes of >3,200 leaves representing >270 vines from wild relatives of domesticated grape (Vitis spp.) to determine if leaf shapes attributable to genetics and development are separable from each other.\\nC_LIO_LIWe isolate latent shapes (multivariate signatures that vary independently from each other) embedded within the overall shape of leaves. These latent shapes can predict developmental stages independent from species identity and vice versa. Shapes predictive of development are then used to stage leaves from 1,200 varieties of domesticated grape (Vitis vinifera), revealing that changes in timing underlie leaf shape diversity.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results indicate distinct latent shapes combine to produce a composite morphology in leaves, and that developmental and evolutionary contributions to shape vary independently from each other.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Perception is subjective. Even basic judgments, like those of visual object size, vary substantially between observers and also across the visual field within the same observer. The way in which the visual system determines the size of objects remains unclear, however. We hypothesize that object size is inferred from neuronal population activity in V1 and predict that idiosyncrasies in cortical functional architecture should therefore explain individual differences in size judgments. Indeed, using novel behavioral methods and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we demonstrate that biases in size perception are correlated with the spatial tuning of neuronal populations in healthy volunteers. To explain this relationship, we formulate a population read-out model that directly links the spatial distribution of V1 representations to our perceptual experience of visual size. Altogether, we suggest that the individual perception of simple stimuli is warped by idiosyncrasies in visual cortical organization.",

We developed a method based on single-cell analysis to phenotype human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC) by high-throughput imaging. Our method uses markers for morphology and pluripotency as well as social features to characterize perturbations using a meta-phenotype based on mapping single cells to distinct phenotypic classes. Analysis of perturbations on a single cell level enhances the applicability of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC) for screening experiments taking the inherently increased phenotypic variability of these cells into account. We adapted miniaturized culture conditions to allow for the utilization of hIPSC in RNA interference (RNAi) high-throughput screens and single cell phenotyping by image analysis. We identified key regulators of pluripotency in hIPSC masked in a population-averaged analysis and we confirmed several candidate genes (SMG1, TAF1) and assessed their effect on pluripotency.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptome measurements are being applied at rapidly increasing scales to study cellular repertoires underpinning functions of complex tissues and organs, including mammalian brains. The transcriptional state of each cell, however, reflects a variety of biological factors, including persistent cell-type specific regulatory configurations, transient processes such as cell cycle, local metabolic demands, and extracellular signals. Depending on the biological setting, all such aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity can be of potential interest, but detecting complex heterogeneity structure from inherently uncertain single-cell data presents analytical challenges. We developed PAGODA to resolve multiple, potentially overlapping aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity by identifying known pathways or novel gene sets that show significant excess of coordinated variability among the measured cells. We demonstrate that PAGODA effectively recovers the subpopulations and their corresponding functional characteristics in a variety of single-cell samples, and use it to characterize transcriptional diversity of neuronal progenitors in the developing mouse cortex.",

    "abstract": "DNA assembly is a core methodological step in metagenomic pipelines used to study the structure and function within microbial communities. Here we investigate the utility of Pacific Biosciences long and high accuracy circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads for metagenomics projects. We compared the application and performance of both PacBio CCS and Illumina HiSeq data with assembly and taxonomic binning algorithms using metagenomic samples representing a complex microbial community. Eight SMRT cells produced approximately 94 Mb of CCS reads from a biogas reactor microbiome sample, which averaged 1319 nt in length and 99.7 % accuracy. CCS data assembly generated a comparative number of large contigs greater than 1 kb, to those assembled from a [~]190x larger HiSeq dataset ([~]18 Gb) produced from the same sample (i.e approximately 62 % of total contigs). Hybrid assemblies using PacBio CCS and HiSeq contigs produced improvements in assembly statistics, including an increase in the average contig length and number of large contigs. The incorporation of CCS data produced significant enhancements in taxonomic binning and genome reconstruction of two dominant phylotypes, which assembled and binned poorly using HiSeq data alone. Collectively these results illustrate the value of PacBio CCS reads in certain metagenomics applications.",

    "abstract": "Historical biogeography seeks to understand the distribution of biodiversity in space and time. The dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model, a likelihood-based model of geographic range evolution, is widely used in assessing the biogeography of clades. Robust inference of dispersal and local extinction parameters is crucial for biogeographic inference, and yet a major caveat to its use is that the DEC model severely underestimates local extinction. We suggest that this is mainly due to the way in which the model is constructed to allow observed species to transition into being present in no areas (i.e., null range). By prohibiting transitions into the null range in the transition rate matrix, we were able to better infer local extinction and support this with simulations. This modified model, DEC*, has higher model fit and model adequacy than DEC, suggesting this modification should be considered for DEC and other models of geographic range evolution.",

Here we present an efficient, flexible statistical method, diCal2, that can utilize whole-genome sequence data from multiple populations to infer complex demographic models involving population size changes, population splits, admixture, and migration. Applying our method to data from Australian, East Asian, European, and Papuan populations, we find that the population ancestral to Australians and Papuans started separating from East Asians and Europeans about 100,000 years ago, and that the separation of East Asians and Europeans started about 50,000 years ago, with pervasive gene flow between all pairs of populations.",

    "abstract": "Mutation is the ultimate source of all genetic variation and is, therefore, central to evolutionary change. Previous work on Paramecium tetraurelia found an unusually low germline base-substitution mutation rate in this ciliate. Here, we tested the generality of this result among ciliates using Tetrahymena thermophila. We sequenced the genomes of 10 lines of T. thermophila that had each undergone approximately 1,000 generations of mutation accumulation (MA). We applied an existing mutation-calling pipeline and developed a new probabilistic mutation detection approach that directly models the design of an MA experiment and accommodates the noise introduced by mismapped reads. Our probabilistic mutation-calling method provides a straightforward way of estimating the number of sites at which a mutation could have been called if one was present, providing the denominator for our mutation rate calculations. From these methods, we find that T. thermophila has a germline base-substitution mutation rate of 7.61 x 10-12 per site, per cell division, which is consistent with the low base-substitution mutation rate in P. tetraurelia. Over the course of the evolution experiment, genomic exclusion lines derived from the MA lines experienced a fitness decline that cannot be accounted for by germline base-substitution mutations alone, suggesting that other genetic or epigenetic factors must be involved. Because selection can only operate to reduce mutation rates based upon the \\\"visible\\\" mutational load, asexual reproduction with a transcriptionally silent germline may allow ciliates to evolve extremely low germline mutation rates.",
