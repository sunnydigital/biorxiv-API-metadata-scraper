    "abstract": "Introduction Introduction Main text Methods References The impact of environment on human health is dramatic, with major risk factors including substance use1, diet2 and exercise3. However, identifying interactions between the environment and an individuals genetic background (GxE) has been hampered by statistical and computational challenges4,5. By combining RNA sequencing of whole blood and extensive environmental annotations collected from 922 individuals6, we have evaluated GxE interactions at a cellular level. We have developed EAGLE, a hierarchical Bayesian model for identifying GxE interactions based on association between environment and allele-specific expression (ASE). EAGLE inc ...",

    "abstract": "Abstract Existing models of parental investment have mainly focused on interactions at the level of the family, and have paid much less attention to the impact of population-level processes. Here we extend classical models of parental care to assess the impact of population structure and limited dispersal. We find that sex-differences in dispersal substantially affect the amount of care provided by each parent, with the more philopatric sex providing the majority of the care to young. This effect is most pronounced in highly viscous populations: in such cases, when classical models would predict stable biparental care, inclusion of a modest sex difference in dispersal leads to uniparental care by the philopatric sex. In addition, mating skew also affects sex-differences in parental investment, with the more numerous sex providing most of the care. However, the effect of mating skew only holds when parents care for their own offspring. When individuals breed communally, we recover the previous finding that the more philopatric sex provides most of the care, even when it is the rare sex. Finally, we show that sex-differences in dispersal can mask the existence of sex-specific costs of care, because the philopatric sex may provide most of the care even in the face of far higher mortality costs relative to the dispersing sex. We conclude that sex-biased dispersal is likely to be an important, yet currently overlooked driver of sex-differences in parental care.",

    "abstract": "The West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus) is threatened throughout its distribution, and is categorized as vulnerable by IUCN (Lefebvre 2001, IUCN 2007). The number of mature individuals is currently estimated at less than 10,000 and is expected to decline at a rate of at least 10% over the next 20 years as a result of both habitat loss and anthropogenic factors (Deutsch et al. 2008). While the West Indian manatee is the most widespread of all existing sirenians, some populations are estimated at fewer than 10 individuals (Deutsch et al. 2008, Quintana-Rizzo and Reynolds 2010). In addition, in most Central American countries reliable information on manatee distribution and conservation status is missing and there is need to assess these remnant populations to guide future management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Various initiatives to identify global priority areas for conservation have been developed over the last 20 years (e.g. Biodiversity Hotspots). However, translating this information to actionable local scales has proven to be a major task, highlighting the necessity of efforts to bridge the global-scale priority areas with local-based conservation actions. Furthermore, as these global priority areas are increasingly threatened by climate change and by the loss and alteration of their natural habitats, developing additional efforts to identify priority areas for restoration activities is becoming an urgent task. In this study we used a Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (SMCDA) approach to help optimize the selection of sites for restoration initiatives of two endemic threatened flora species of the \\\"Chilean Winter Rainfall-Valdivian Forest\\\" Hotspot. Our approach takes advantage of freely GIS software, niche modeling tools, and available geospatial databases, in an effort to provide an affordable methodology to bridge global-scale priority areas with local actionable restoration scales. We used a set of weighting scenarios to evaluate the potential effects of short-term vs long-term planning perspective in prioritization results. The generated SMCDA was helpful for evaluating, identifying and prioritizing best suitable areas for restoration of the assessed species. The method proved to be simple, transparent, cost effective and flexible enough to be easily replicable on different ecosystems. This approach could be useful for prioritizing regional-scale areas for species restoration in Chile, as well as in other countries with restricted budgets for conservation efforts.",
