    "abstract": "Determining the methylation state of regions with high copy numbers is challenging for second-generation sequencing, because the read length is insufficient to map reads uniquely, especially when repetitive regions are long and nearly identical to each other. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing is a promising method for observing such regions, because it is not vulnerable to GC bias, it performs long read lengths, and its kinetic information is sensitive to DNA modifications. We propose a novel algorithm that combines the kinetic information for neighboring CpG sites and increases the confidence in identifying the methylation states of those sites. Both the sensitivity and precision of our algorithm were [~]93.7% on CpG site basis for the genome of an inbred medaka (Oryzias latipes) strain within a practical read coverage of [~]30-fold. The method is quantitatively accurate because we observed a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.884) between our method and bisulfite sequencing, and 92.0% of CpG sites were in concordance within 0.25. Using this method, we characterized the landscape of the methylation status of repetitive elements, such as LINEs, in the human genome, thereby revealing the strong correlation between CpG density and unmethylation and detecting unmethylation hot spots of LTRs and LINEs. We could uncover the methylation states for nearly identical active transposons, two novel LINE insertions of identity [~]99% and length 6050 base pairs (bp) in the human genome, and sixteen Tol2 elements of identity >99.8% and length 4682 bp in the medaka genome.",

    "abstract": "For several species, refuges (such as burrows, dens, roosts, nests) are an essential resource for protection from predators and extreme environmental conditions. Refuges also serve as focal sites for social interactions including mating, courtship and aggression. Knowledge of refuge use patterns can therefore provide information about social structure, mating and foraging success, as well as the robustness and health of wildlife populations, especially for species considered to be relatively solitary. In this study, we construct networks of burrow use to infer social associations in a threatened wildlife species typically considered solitary - the desert tortoise. We show that tortoise social networks are significantly different than null networks of random associations, and have moderate spatial constraints. We next use statistical models to identify major mechanisms behind individual-level variation in tortoise burrow use, popularity of burrows in desert tortoise habitat and test for stressor-driven changes in refuge use patterns. We show that seasonal variation has a strong impact on tortoise burrow switching behavior. On the other hand, burrow age and topographical condition influence the number of tortoises visiting a burrow in desert tortoise habitat. Of three major population stressors affecting this species (translocation, drought, disease), translocation alters tortoise burrow switching behavior, with translocated animals visiting fewer unique burrows than residents. In a species that is not social, our study highlights the importance of leveraging refuge use behavior to study the presence of and mechanisms behind non-random social structure and individual-level variation. Our analysis of the impact of stressors on refuge-based social structure further emphasizes the potential of this method to detect environmental or anthropogenic disturbances.\\n\\nSignificance statement: Adaptive and social behavior that affects fitness is now being increasingly incorporated in the conservation and management of wildlife species. However, direct observations of social interactions in species considered to be solitary are difficult, and therefore integration of behavior in conservation and management decisions in such species has been infrequent. For such species, we propose quantifying refuge use behavior as it can provide insights towards their (hidden) social structure, establish relevant contact patterns of infectious disease spread, and provide early warning signals of population stressors. Our study highlights this approach in a long-lived and threatened species, the desert tortoise. We provide evidence towards the presence of and identify mechanisms behind the social structure in desert tortoises formed by their burrow use preferences. We also show how individuals burrow use behavior responds to the presence of population stressors.",

    "abstract": "Errors during transcription may play an important role in determining cellular phenotypes: the RNA polymerase error rate is >4 orders of magnitude higher than that of DNA polymerase and errors are amplified >1000-fold due to translation. However, current methods to measure RNA polymerase fidelity are low-throughout, technically challenging, and organism specific. Here I show that changes in RNA polymerase fidelity can be measured using standard RNA sequencing protocols. I find that RNA polymerase is error-prone, and these errors can result in splicing defects. Furthermore, I find that differential expression of RNA polymerase subunits causes changes in RNA polymerase fidelity, and that coding sequences may have evolved to minimize the effect of these errors. These results suggest that errors caused by RNA polymerase may be a major source of stochastic variability at the level of single cells.\\n\\nThe information that determines protein sequence is stored in the genome but that in ...",

    "abstract": "Hybridization is known to occur in a wide range of avian species, yet the rate and persistence of hybridization on populations is often hard to assess. Genotyping using variable genetic marker sets has become a common tool to identify hybrid individuals, however assignment outputs can differ depending on the marker set used. Here, we study hybrid assignment in two sibling Hippolais warblers, where hybrid assignment has shown to differ between SSR and AFLP markers. Simulation of heterospecific individuals as well as backcrosses (typed using SSR markers) reveals a rapid loss of assignment probability in higher backcross generations.\\n\\nHowever, the characterization of F1 hybrids was clearly distinguished from both parental taxa. The differences in marker sets are not contradictory but complementary. The rate of hybridization is lower than previously expected with AFLP markers but introgression might be long-lasting. This could be either due to differences in power of the marker systems used or due to non-neutral variation covered by AFLP but not SSR markers. We call for more attention to be paid regarding the potential limits of classical marker systems to investigate hybridization and its persistence in natural systems.",

    "abstract": "AimChanges in community composition resulting from environmental changes modify biotic interactions and affect the distribution and density of local populations. Such changes are currently occurring in nettle-feeding butterflies in Sweden where Araschnia levana has recently expanded its range northward and is now likely to interact with the resident species (Aglais urticae and Aglais io). Butterfly occurrence data collected over years and across regions enabled us to investigate how a recent range expansion of A. levana may have affected the environmental niche of resident species.\\n\\nLocationWe focused on two regions of Sweden (Sk[a]ne and Norrstrom) where A. levana has and has not established, and two time-periods (2001-2006, 2009-2012) during its establishment in Sk[a]ne.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed two distinct analyses in each region using the PCA-env and the framework described in Broennimann et al. (2012). First, we described the main sources of variation in the environment. Second, in each time-period and region, we characterized the realized niches of our focal species across topographic and land use gradients. Third, we quantified overlaps and differences in realized niches between and within species over time.\\n\\nResultsIn Sk[a]ne, A. levana has stabilized its distribution over time while the distribution of the native species has shifted. These shifts depicted a consistent pattern of avoiding overlap between the native species and the environmental space occupied by A. levana, and it was stronger for A. urticae than for A. io. In both regions, we also found evidence of niche partitioning between native species.\\n\\nMain conclusionsInterspecific interactions are likely to affect local species distributions. It appears that the ongoing establishment of A. levana has modified local biotic interactions, and induced shifts in resident species distributions. Among the mechanisms that can explain such patterns of niche partitioning, parasitoid-driven apparent competition may play an important role in this community.",

    "abstract": "Admixture-introduced linkage disequilibrium (LD) has recently been introduced into the inference of the histories of complex admixtures. However, the influence of ancestral source populations on the LD pattern in admixed populations is not properly taken into consideration by currently available methods, which affects the estimation of several gene flow parameters from empirical data. We first illustrated the dynamic changes of LD in admixed populations and mathematically formulated the LD under a generalized admixture model with finite population size. We next developed a new method, MALDmef, by fitting LD with multiple exponential functions for inferring and dating multiple-wave admixtures. MALDmef takes into account the effects of source populations which substantially affect modeling LD in admixed population, which renders it capable of efficiently detecting and dating multiple-wave admixture events. The performance of MALDmef was evaluated by simulation and it was shown to be more accurate than MALDER, a state-of-the-art method that was recently developed for similar purposes, under various admixture models. We further applied MALDmef to analyzing genome-wide data from the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) and the HapMap Project. Interestingly, we were able to identify more than one admixture events in several populations, which have yet to be reported. For example, two major admixture events were identified in the Xinjiang Uyghur, occurring around 27-30 generations ago and 182-195 generations ago, respectively. In an African population (MKK), three recent major admixtures occurring 13-16, 50-67, and 107-139 generations ago were detected. Our method is a considerable improvement over other current methods and further facilitates the inference of the histories of complex population admixtures.",

These markers can help us to detect differences in the migratory behavior of males and females. Our results show that the populations are highly differentiated suggesting that both females and males have low dispersal distance.
