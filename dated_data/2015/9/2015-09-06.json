    "abstract": "Free iron is highly toxic and the blood-derived iron initiates early motor-neuron degeneration upon breakdown of blood-spinal cord barrier. Iron is currently known to trigger oxidative stress by Fenton chemistry but no report implies that iron manifests its toxicity through CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), the central antioxidant enzyme in all human tissues that carries >180 ALS-causing mutations. Here, by NMR we show that Zn2+ play an irreplaceable role in the maturation of the nascent hSOD1, and further decipher for the first time that out of 11 other cations only Fe2+ has the Zn2+-like capacity to induce folding to form the Fe2+-bound hSOD1. This acts to reduce or even block the maturation of wild-type and ALS-causing mutant hSOD1, consequently trapping SOD1 in toxic forms and provoking oxidative stress. Our study establishes a novel SOD1-dependent mechanism for iron to manifest cellular toxicity that contributes to pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, aging and even more.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryOur study establishes a novel SOD1-dependent mechanism for iron to manifest toxicity contributing to neurodegenerative diseases, aging and even more.",

    "abstract": "Clustering individuals to subpopulations based on genetic data has become commonplace in many genetic studies. Inference of population structure is most often done by applying model-based approaches, aided by visualization using distance-based approaches such as multidimensional scaling. While existing distance-based approaches suffer from lack of statistical rigor, model-based approaches entail assumptions of prior conditions such as that the subpopulations are at Hardy-Weinberg equilibria. Here we present a distance-based approach for inference of population structure using genetic data by defining population structure using network theory terminology and methods. A network is constructed from a pairwise genetic-similarity matrix of all sampled individuals. The community partition, a partition of a network to dense subgraphs, is equated with population structure, a partition of the population to genetically related groups. Community detection algorithms are used to partition the network into communities, interpreted as a partition of the population to subpopulations. The statistical significance of the structure can be estimated by using permutation tests to evaluate the significance of the partitions modularity, a network theory measure indicating the quality of community partitions. In order to further characterize population structure, a new measure of the Strength of Association (SA) for an individual to its assigned community is presented. The Strength of Association Distribution (SAD) of the communities is analyzed to provide additional population structure characteristics, such as the relative amount of gene flow experienced by the different subpopulations and identification of hybrid individuals. Human genetic data and simulations are used to demonstrate the applicability of the analyses. The approach presented here provides a novel, computationally efficient, model-free method for inference of population structure which does not entail assumption of prior conditions. The method is implemented in the software NetStruct, available at https://github.com/GiliG/NetStruct.",

    "abstract": "O_LISampling ecological interactions presents similar challenges, problems, potential biases, and constraints as sampling individuals and species in biodiversity inventories. Interactions are just pairwise relationships among individuals of two different species, such as those among plants and their seed dispersers in frugivory interactions or those among plants and their pollinators. Sampling interactions is a fundamental step to build robustly estimated interaction networks, yet few analyses have attempted a formal approach to their sampling protocols.\\nC_LIO_LIRobust estimates of the actual number of interactions (links) within diversified ecological networks require adequate sampling effort that needs to be explicitly gauged. Yet we still lack a sampling theory explicitly focusing on ecological interactions.\\nC_LIO_LIWhile the complete inventory of interactions is likely impossible, a robust characterization of its main patterns and metrics is probably realistic. We must acknowledge that a sizable fraction of the maximum number of interactions Imax among, say, A animal species and P plant species (i.e., Imax = AP) is impossible to record due to forbidden links, i.e., life-history restrictions. Thus, the number of observed interactions I in robustly sampled networks is typically I << Imax, resulting in extremely sparse interaction matrices with low connectance.\\nC_LIO_LIReasons for forbidden links are multiple but mainly stem from spatial and temporal uncoupling, size mismatches, and intrinsically low probabilities of interspecific encounter for most potential interactions of partner species. Ad-equately assessing the completeness of a network of ecological interactions thus needs knowledge of the natural history details embedded, so that for-bidden links can be \\\"discounted\\\" when addressing sampling effort.\\nC_LIO_LIHere I provide a review and outline a conceptual framework for interaction sampling by building an explicit analogue to individuals and species sampling, thus extending diversity-monitoring approaches to the characterization of complex networks of ecological interactions. This is crucial to assess the fast-paced and devastating effects of defaunation-driven loss of key ecological interactions and the services they provide and the analogous losses related to interaction gains due to invasive species and biotic homogenization.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Viruses are the simplest replicating units, characterized by a limited number of coding genes and an exceptionally high rate of overlapping genes. We sought a unified explanation for the evolutionary constraints that govern genome sizes, gene overlapping and capsid properties. We performed an unbiased statistical analysis over the [~]100 known viral families, and came to refute widespread assumptions regarding viral evolution. We found that the volume utilization of viral capsids is often low, and greatly varies among families. Most notably, we show that the total amount of gene overlapping is tightly bounded. Although viruses expand three orders of magnitude in genome length, their absolute amount of gene overlapping almost never exceeds 1500 nucleotides, and mostly confined to <4 significant overlapping instances. Our results argue against the common theory by which gene overlapping is driven by a necessity of viruses to compress their genome. Instead, we support the notion that overlapping has a role in gene novelty and evolution exploration.",

    "abstract": "Hfq is the bacterial orthologue of the eukaryotic (L)Sm family of proteins found across all domains of life and potentially an ancient protein, but it has not been found in all phyletic lines. A careful search successfully identified a distant hfq orthologue in the cyanobacteria leaving the actinobacteria as the major phylum with no known hfq orthologue. A search for hfq in actinobacteria, using domain enhanced searching (DELTA-BLAST) with cyanobacterial hfq, identified a conserved actinobacterial specific protein as remotely homologous. Structural homology modelling using profile matching to fold libraries and ab initio 3D structure determination supports this prediction and suggests module shuffling in the evolution of the actinobacterial hfq. Our results provide the basis to explore this prediction, and exploit it, across diverse taxa with potentially important post-transcriptional regulatory effects in virulence, antibiotic production and interactions in human microbiomes. However, the role of hfq in gram positive bacteria has remained elusive and experimental verification will be challenging.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn 2012, two large pharmacogenomic studies, the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), were published, each reported gene expression data and measures of drug response for a large number of drugs and hundreds of cell lines. In 2013, we published a comparative analysis that reported gene expression profiles for the 471 cell lines profiled in both studies and dose response measurements for the 15 drugs characterized in the common cell lines by both studies. While we found good concordance in gene expression profiles, there was substantial inconsistency in the drug responses reported by the GDSC and CCLE projects. Our paper was widely discussed and we received extensive feedback on the comparisons that we performed. This feedback, along with the release of new data, prompted us to revisit our initial analysis. Here we present a new analysis using these expanded data in which we address the most significant suggestions for improvements on our published analysis: that drugs with different response characteristics should have been treated differently, that targeted therapies and broad cytotoxic drugs should have been treated differently in assessing consistency, that consistency of both molecular profiles and drug sensitivity measurements should both be compared across cell lines to accurately assess differences in the studies, that we missed some biomarkers that are consistent between studies, and that the software analysis tools we provided with our analysis should have been easier to run, particularly as the GDSC and CCLE released additional data.\\n\\nMethodsFor each drug, we used published sensitivity data from the GDSC and CCLE to separately estimate drug dose-response curves. We then used two statistics, the area between drug dose-response curves (ABC) and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), to robustly estimate the consistency of continuous and discrete drug sensitivity measures, respectively. We also used recently released RNA-seq data together with previously published gene expression microarray data to assess inter-platform reproducibility of cell line gene expression profiles.\\n\\nResultsThis re-analysis supports our previous finding that gene expression data are significantly more consistent than drug sensitivity measurements. The use of new statistics to assess data consistency allowed us to identify two broad effect drugs -- 17-AAG and PD-0332901 -- and three targeted drugs -- PLX4720, nilotinib and crizotinib -- with moderate to good consistency in drug sensitivity data between GDSC and CCLE. Not enough sensitive cell lines were screened in both studies to robustly assess consistency for three other targeted drugs, PHA-665752, erlotinib, and sorafenib. Concurring with our published results, we found evidence of inconsistencies in pharmacological phenotypes for the remaining eight drugs. Further, to discover \\\"consistency\\\" between studies required the use of multiple statistics and the selection of specific measures on a case-by-case basis.\\n\\nConclusionOur results reaffirm our initial findings of an inconsistency in drug sensitivity measures for eight of fifteen drugs screened both in GDSC and CCLE, irrespective of which statistical metric was used to assess correlation. Taken together, our findings suggest that the phenotypic data on drug response in the GDSC and CCLE continue to present challenges for robust biomarker discovery. This re-analysis provides additional support for the argument that experimental standardization and validation of pharmacogenomic response will be necessary to advance the broad use of large pharmacogenomic screens.",

    "abstract": "In outcrossing populations, \\\"Haldanes Sieve\\\" states that recessive beneficial alleles are less likely to fix than dominant ones, because they are less expose to selection when rare. In contrast, selfing organisms are not subject to Haldanes Sieve and are more likely to fix recessive types than outcrossers, as selfing rapidly creates homozygotes, increasing overall selection acting on mutations. However, longer homozygous tracts in selfers also reduces the ability of recombination to create new genotypes. It is unclear how these two effects influence overall adaptation rates in partially selfing organisms. Here, we calculate the fixation probability of beneficial alleles if there is an existing selective sweep in the population. We consider both the potential loss of the second beneficial mutation if it has a weaker advantage than the first, and the possible replacement of the initial allele if the second mutant is fitter. Overall, loss of weaker adaptive alleles during a first selective sweep has a larger impact on preventing fixation of both mutations in highly selfing organisms. Furthermore, the presence of linked mutations has two opposing effects on Haldanes Sieve. First, recessive mutants are disproportionally likely to be lost in outcrossers, so it is likelier that dominant mutations will fix. Second, with elevated rates of adaptive mutation, selective interference annuls the advantage in selfing organisms of not suffering from Haldanes Sieve; outcrossing organisms are more able to fix weak beneficial mutations of any dominance value. Overall, weakened recombination effects can greatly limit adaptation in selfing organisms.",
