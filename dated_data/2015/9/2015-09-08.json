    "abstract": "Survival in aquatic environments requires organisms to have effective means of collecting information from their surroundings through various sensing strategies. In this study, we explore how sensing mode and range depend on body size. We find a hierarchy of sensing modes determined by body size. With increasing body size, a larger battery of modes becomes available (chemosensing, mechanosensing, vision, hearing, and echolocation, in that order) while the sensing range also increases. This size-dependent hierarchy and the transitions between primary sensory modes are explained on the grounds of limiting factors set by physiology and the physical laws governing signal generation, transmission and reception. We theoretically predict the body size limits for various sensory modes, which align well with size ranges found in literature. The treatise of all ocean life, from unicellular organisms to whales, demonstrates how body size determines available sensing modes, and thereby acts as a major structuring factor of aquatic life.",

    "abstract": "A digital approach to protein identification and quantity estimation using electrical measurements and database search is proposed. It is based on an electrolytic cell with two (three) nanopores and one (two) peptidase(s) covalently attached to the trans side of a pore. An unknown protein is digested by a reagent or peptidase into peptides ending in a known amino acid; the peptides enter the cell, pass through the first pore, and are fragmented by a high-specificity endopeptidase. The second enzyme, if present, is an exopeptidase that cleaves the fragments into single residues after the second pore. Level transitions in an ionic blockade or transverse current pulse due to residues in a fragment or individual pulses due to single residues are counted. This yields the positions of the endopeptidases target in the peptide, and, together with the peptides terminal residue, a partial sequence. Search through the Uniprot database for such sequences identifies over 90% of the proteins in the human proteome. The percentage can be increased by repeating the procedure with other reagents and cells specific to other residues, close to 100% may be possible. Sample purification to homogeneity is not required as the method applies to an arbitrary mixture of proteins; the quantity of a protein in the sample is estimated from the number of identifying peptides sensed over a long run. A Fokker-Planck model gives minimum enzyme turnover intervals required for ordered sensing of peptide fragments. With thick (80-100 nm) pores, required pulse resolution times are within the capability of CMOS detectors. The method can be implemented with existing technology; several related issues are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Detecting the targets of adaptive natural selection from whole genome sequencing data is a central problem for population genetics. However, to date most methods have shown sub-optimal performance under realistic demographic scenarios. Moreover, over the past decade there has been a renewed interest in determining the importance of selection from standing variation in adaptation of natural populations, yet very few methods for inferring this model of adaptation at the genome scale have been introduced. Here we introduce a new method, S/HIC, which uses supervised machine learning to precisely infer the location of both hard and soft selective sweeps. We show that S/HIC has unrivaled accuracy for detecting sweeps under demographic histories that are relevant to human populations, and distinguishing sweeps from linked as well as neutrally evolving regions. Moreover we show that S/HIC is uniquely robust among its competitors to model misspecification. Thus even if the true demographic model of a population differs catastrophically from that specified by the user, S/HIC still retains impressive discriminatory power. Finally we apply S/HIC to the case of resequencing data from human chromosome 18 in a European population sample and demonstrate that we can reliably recover selective sweeps that have been identified earlier using less specific and sensitive methods.",

A frequent requirement of single cell expression experiments is the identification of novel patterns of heterogeneity across single cells that might explain complex cellular states or tissue composition. To date, classical statistical analysis tools have being routinely applied to single cell data, but there is considerable scope for the development of novel statistical approaches that are better adapted to the challenges of inferring cellular hierarchies.\\n\\nResultsHere, we present a novel integration of principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering to create a framework for characterising cell state identity. Our methodology uses agglomerative clustering to generate a cell state hierarchy where each cluster branch is associated with a principal component of variation that can be used to differentiate two cellular states. We demonstrate that using real single cell datasets this approach allows for consistent clustering of single cell transcriptional profiles across multiple scales of interpretation.\\n\\nAvailabilityR implementation of pcaReduce algorithm is available from https://github.com/JustinaZ/pcaReduce",

    "abstract": "Methods for inference and interpretation of evolutionary quantitative genetic parameters, and for prediction of the response to selection, are best developed for traits with normal distributions. Many traits of evolutionary interest, including many life history and behavioural traits, have inherently non-normal distributions. The generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) framework has become a widely used tool for estimating quantitative genetic parameters for non-normal traits. However, whereas GLMMs provide inference on a statistically-convenient latent scale, it is sometimes desirable to express quantitative genetic parameters on the scale upon which traits are expressed. The parameters of a fitted GLMMs, despite being on a latent scale, fully determine all quantities of potential interest on the scale on which traits are expressed. We provide expressions for deriving each of such quantities, including population means, phenotypic (co)variances, variance components including additive genetic (co)variances, and parameters such as heritability. We demonstrate that fixed effects have a strong impact on those parameters and show how to deal for this effect by averaging or integrating over fixed effects. The expressions require integration of quantities determined by the link function, over distributions of latent values. In general cases, the required integrals must be solved numerically, but efficient methods are available and we provide an implementation in an R package, QGglmm. We show that known formulae for quantities such as heritability of traits with Binomial and Poisson distributions are special cases of our expressions. Additionally, we show how fitted GLMM can be incorporated into existing methods for predicting evolutionary trajectories. We demonstrate the accuracy of the resulting method for evolutionary prediction by simulation, and apply our approach to data from a wild pedigreed vertebrate population.",

    "abstract": "The detection of genomic regions involved in local adaptation is an important topic in current population genetics. There are several detection strategies available depending on the kind of genetic and demographic information at hand. A common drawback is the high risk of false positives. In this study, we introduce two complementary methods for the detection of divergent selection from populations connected by migration. Both methods have been developed with the aim of being robust to false positives. The first method combines haplotype information with inter-population differentiation (FST). Evidence of divergent selection is concluded only when both the haplotype pattern and the FST value support it. The second method is developed for independently segregating markers i.e. there is no haplotype information at hand. In this case, the power to detect selection is attained by developing a new outlier test based on detecting a bimodal distribution. The test computes the FST outliers and then assumes that those of interest would have a different mode which is detected by a clustering algorithm. The utility of the two methods is demonstrated through simulations and the analysis of real data. The simulation results show power ranging from 60-94% in several of the scenarios whilst the false positive rate is controlled below the nominal level in every scenario. The analysis of real samples consisted of phased data from the HapMap project and unphased data from intertidal marine snail ecotypes. The software HacDivSel implements the methods explained in this manuscript.",

Here we use whole-genome re-sequencing data to characterize and compare genome-wide patterns of nucleotide polymorphism, site frequency spectrum and population-scaled recombination rates in three species of Populus: P. tremula, P. tremuloides and P. trichocarpa. We find that P. tremuloides has the highest level of genome-wide variation, skewed allele frequencies and population-scaled recombination rates, whereas P. trichocarpa harbors the lowest. Our findings highlight multiple lines of evidence suggesting that natural selection, both due to purifying and positive selection, has widely shaped patterns of nucleotide polymorphism at linked neutral sites in all three species. Differences in effective population sizes and rates of recombination are largely explaining the disparate magnitudes and signatures of linked selection we observe among species. The present work provides the first phylogenetic comparative study at genome-wide scale in forest trees. This information will also improve our ability to understand how various evolutionary forces have interacted to influence genome evolution among related species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPouteria splendens (lucumo chileno) is an endemic shrub to the coastal areas of Central Chile classified as Endangered and Rare by the Chilean threatened species list, but as Lower Risk (LR) by IUCN. Based in historical records some authors have hypothesized that P. splendens originally formed a large metapopulation, but due to habitat loss and fragmentation these populations have been reduced to two main areas separated by 100 km, neither of both currently protected by the Chilean system of protected areas. Knowledge about this species is scarce and no studies have provided evidence to support the large metapopulation hypothesis. This gap of knowledge limits our availability to gauge the real urgency to conserve remaining P. splendens populations, which can generate tragic consequences in light of the increasing land-use change and climatic change that are facing these populations. In this study we combined niche modelling, land-use information, future climatic scenarios, and conservation genetics techniques, to test the hypothesis of a potential original large metapopulation, evaluate the role of land-use change in population decline, assess the threats this species may face in the future, and combine the generated information to re-assess its conservation status using the IUCN criteria.\\n\\nResultsOur results show that locations with P. splendens are fewer than described in the literature. Results from the niche modelling and genetic analyses support the hypothesis of an originally large metapopulation that was recently reduced and fragmented by anthropogenic land-use change. Future climate change could increase the range of suitable habitats for P. splendens towards inland areas; however the high level of fragmentation of these new areas is expected to preclude colonization processes.\\n\\nConclusionsBased on our results we recommend urgent actions towards the conservation of this species, including (1) re-evaluating its current IUCN conservation status and reclassifying it as Endangered (EN), and (2) take immediate actions to develop strategies that effectively protect the remaining populations.",

Most of these mutations and alterations are termed passengers because they do not confer cancer phenotypes. Evolutionary simulations and cancer genomic studies suggested that mildly-deleterious passengers accumulate, collectively slow cancer progression, reduce the fitness of cancer cells and enhance the effects of therapeutics. However, these effects of passengers and their impact on clinical variables remain limited to genomic analysis. Here, to assess passengers effect on cell fitness and cancer, we specifically introduced increasing passenger loads into human cell lines and mouse models. We found that passenger load dramatically reduced cancer cells fitness in every model investigated. Passengers average fitness cost of [~]3% per MB, indicates that genomic instability in cancer in patients can slow tumor growth and prevent metastatic progression. We conclude that genomic instability in cancer is a double-edged sword: it accelerates the accumulation of adaptive drivers, yet incurs a harmful passenger load that can outweigh drivers benefit. Passenger load could be a useful biomarker for tumor aggressiveness and response to mutagenic or passenger-exacerbating therapies, including anti-tumor immunity.",

Here, we utilized admixture induced linkage disequilibrium (LD) to infer occurrence of continuous admixture events, which is common for most existing admixed populations. Unlike previous studies, we expanded the typical continuous admixture model to a more general admixture scenario with isolation after a certain duration of continuous gene flow, and we demonstrated that such treatment significantly improved the accuracy of inference under complex admixture scenarios. Based on the extended models, we developed a method based on weighted LD to infer the admixture history considering continuous and complex demographic process of gene flow between populations. We evaluated the performance of the method by computer simulation and applied our method to real data analysis of a few well-known admixed populations.",
