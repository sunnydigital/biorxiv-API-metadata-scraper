    "abstract": "Cultural transmission of reproductive success states that successful men have more children and pass this raised fecundity to their offspring. Balaresque and colleagues found high frequency haplotypes in a Central Asian Y chromosome dataset, which they attribute to cultural transmission of reproductive success by prominent historical men, including Genghis Khan. Using coalescent simulation, we show that these high frequency haplotypes are consistent with a neutral model, where they commonly appear simply by chance. Hence, explanations invoking cultural transmission of reproductive success are statistically unnecessary.",

    "abstract": "Beneficial mutations fuel adaptation by altering phenotypes that enhance the fit of organisms to their environment. However, the phenotypic effects of mutations often depend on ecological context, making the distribution of effects across multiple environments essential to understanding the true nature of beneficial mutations. Studies that address both the genetic basis and ecological consequences of adaptive mutations remain rare. Here, we characterize the direct and pleiotropic fitness effects of a collection of 21 first-step beneficial mutants derived from naive and adapted genotypes used in a long-term experimental evolution of Escherichia coli. Whole-genome sequencing was used to identify most beneficial mutations. In contrast to previous studies, we find diverse fitness effects of mutations selected in a simple environment and few cases of genetic parallelism. The pleiotropic effects of these mutations were predominantly positive but some mutants were highly antagonistic in alternative environments. Further, the fitness effects of mutations derived from the adapted genotypes were dramatically reduced in nearly all environments. These findings suggest that many beneficial variants are accessible from a single point on the fitness landscape, and the fixation of alternative beneficial mutations may have dramatic consequences for niche breadth reduction via metabolic erosion.",

    "abstract": "Spatial organization of the genome is critical for condition-specific gene expression. Previous studies have shown that functionally related genes tend to be spatially proximal. However, these studies have not been extended to multiple human cell types, and the extent to which context-specific spatial proximity of a pathway is related to its context-specific activity is not known. We report the first pathway-centric analyses of spatial proximity in six human cell lines. We find that spatial proximity of genes in a pathway tends to be context-specific, in a manner consistent with the pathways context-specific expression and function; housekeeping genes are ubiquitously proximal to each other, and cancer-related pathways such as p53 signaling are uniquely proximal in hESC. Intriguingly, we find a correlation between the spatial proximity of genes and interactions of their protein products, even after accounting for the propensity of co-pathway proteins to interact. Related pathways are also often spatially proximal to one another, and housekeeping genes tend to be proximal to several other pathways suggesting their coordinating role. Further, the spatially proximal genes in a pathway tend to be the drivers of the pathway activity and are enriched for transcription, splicing and transport functions. Overall, our analyses reveal a pathway-centric organization of the 3D nucleome whereby functionally related and interacting genes, particularly the initial drivers of pathway activity, but also genes across multiple related pathways, are in spatial proximity in a context-specific way. Our results provide further insights into the role of differential spatial organization in cell type-specific pathway activity.",

    "abstract": "For the past 15 years, the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) has served the international research community by offering an integrated platform for viewing and analyzing information from a large database of genome assemblies and their associated annotations. The UCSC Genome Browser has been under continuous development since its inception with new data sets and software features added frequently. Some release highlights of this year include new and updated genome browsers for various assemblies, including bonobo and zebrafish; new gene annotation sets; improvements to track and assembly hub support; and a new interactive tool, the \"Data Integrator\", for intersecting data from multiple tracks. We have greatly expanded the data sets available on the most recent human assembly, hg38/GRCh38, to include updated gene prediction sets from GENCODE, more phenotype- and disease-associated variants from ClinVar and ClinGen, more genomic regulatory data, and a new multiple genome alignment.",
