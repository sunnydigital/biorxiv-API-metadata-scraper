Previous studies of bacterial evolutionary dynamics have shown that populations evolving on fitness landscapes follow predictable paths. In this article, we develop a general mathematical model of evolution and hypothesise that it can be used to understand, and avoid, the emergence of antibiotic resistance.\n\nMethods and FindingsWe develop a Markov Chain model of evolution in asexually reproducing populations which is an encoding of the Strong Selection Weak Mutation model of evolution on fitness landscapes. This model associates the global properties of the fitness landscape with the algebraic properties of the Markov Chain transition matrix and allows us to derive general results on the non-commutativity and irreversibility of natural selection as well as antibiotic cycling strategies. Utilizing this formalism, we analyse 15 empirical fitness landscapes of E. coli under selection by different {beta}-lactam antibiotics and demonstrate that the emergence of resistance to a given antibiotic can be both hindered and promoted by different sequences of drug application. We show that resistance to a given antibiotic is promoted in 61.4%, 68.6% and 70.3% of possible orderings of single, pair or triple prior drug administrations, respectively. Further, we derive optimal drug application sequences with which we can probabilistically  steer the population through genotype space to avoid the emergence of resistance.\n\nConclusionsOur model provides generalisable results of interest to theorists studying evolution as well as providing specific, testable predictions for experimentalists to validate our methods. Further, these results suggest a new strategy in the war against antibiotic-therapy-resistant organisms: drug sequencing to shepherd an evolving population through genotype space to states from which resistance cannot emerge and from which we can maximize the likelihood of successful therapy using existing drugs. While our results are derived using a specific class of antibiotics, the method is generalisable to other situations, including the emergence of resistance to targeted therapy in cancer and how species could change secondary to changing climate or geographical movement.",

    "abstract": "We generated genome-wide data from 69 Europeans who lived between 8,000-3,000 years ago by enriching ancient DNA libraries for a target set of almost four hundred thousand polymorphisms. Enrichment of these positions decreases the sequencing required for genome-wide ancient DNA analysis by a median of around 250-fold, allowing us to study an order of magnitude more individuals than previous studies1-8 and to obtain new insights about the past. We show that the populations of western and far eastern Europe followed opposite trajectories between 8,000-5,000 years ago. At the beginning of the Neolithic period in Europe, ~8,000-7,000 years ago, closely related groups of early farmers appeared in Germany, Hungary, and Spain, different from indigenous hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a distinctive population of hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a ~24,000 year old Siberian6. By ~6,000-5,000 years ago, a resurgence of hunter-gatherer ancestry had occurred throughout much of Europe, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of this time were descended not only from the preceding eastern European hunter-gatherers, but from a population of Near Eastern ancestry. Western and Eastern Europe came into contact ~4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded Ware people from Germany traced ~3/4 of their ancestry to the Yamnaya, documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in all sampled central Europeans until at least ~3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans. These results provide support for the theory of a steppe origin9 of at least some of the Indo-European languages of Europe.",

    "abstract": "Imaging genetics is an emerging field in which the association between genes and neuroimaging-based quantitative phenotypes are used to explore the functional role of genes in neuroanatomy and neurophysiology in the context of healthy function and neuropsychiatric disorders. The main obstacle for researchers in the field is the high dimensionality of the data in both the imaging phenotypes and the genetic variants commonly typed. In this article, we develop a novel method that utilizes Gene Ontology, an online database, to select and prioritize certain genes, employing a stratified false discovery rate (sFDR) approach to investigate their associations with imaging phenotypes. sFDR has the potential to increase power in genome wide association studies (GWAS), and is quickly gaining traction as a method for multiple testing correction. Our novel approach addresses both the pressing need in genetic research to move beyond candidate gene studies, while not being overburdened with a loss of power due to multiple testing. As an example of our methodology, we perform a GWAS of hippocampal volume using the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative sample.",

    "abstract": "Because the rice genome has been sequenced entirely, search to find specific features at genome-wide scale is of high importance. Palindromic sequences are important DNA motifs involved in the regulation of different cellular processes and are a potential source of genetic instability. In order to search and study the long palindromic regions in the rice genome \\\"R\\\" statistical programming language was used. All palindromes, defined as identical inverted repeats with spacer DNA, could be analyzed and sorted according to their frequency, size, GC content, compact index etc. The results showed that the overall palindrome frequency was high in rice genome (nearly 51000 palindromes), with highest and lowest number of palindromes, respectively belongs to chromosome 1 and 12. Palindrome numbers could well explain the rice chromosome expansion (R2>92%). Average GC content of the palindromic sequences is 42.1%, indicating AT-richness and hence, the low-complexity of palindromic sequences. The results also showed different compact indices of palindromes in different chromosomes (43.2 per cM in chromosome 8 and 34.5 per cM in chromosome 3, as highest and lowest, respectively). The possible application of palindrome identification can be the use in the development of a molecular marker system facilitating some genetic studies such as evaluation of genetic variation and gene mapping and also serving as a useful tool in population structure analysis and genome evolution studies. Based on these results it can be concluded that the rice genome is rich in long palindromic sequences that triggered most variation during evolution.\\n\\nAvailability: The R scripts used to construct the palindrome sequence library are available upon request.",
