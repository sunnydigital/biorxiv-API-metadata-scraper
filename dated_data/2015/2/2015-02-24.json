    "abstract": "The study of ecological networks is severely limited by (i) the difficulty to access data, (ii) the lack of a standardized way to link meta-data with interactions, and (iii) the disparity of formats in which ecological networks themselves are represented. To overcome these limitations, we conceived a data specification for ecological networks. We implemented a database respecting this standard, and released a R package (rmangal) allowing users to programmatically access, curate, and deposit data on ecological interactions. In this article, we show how these tools, in conjunctions with other frameworks for the programmatic manipulation of open ecological data, streamlines the analysis process, and improves eplicability and reproducibility of ecological networks studies.",

    "abstract": "In this report we present a multimarker association tool (Flash) based on a novel algorithm to generate haplotypes from raw genotype data. It belongs to the entropy minimization class of methods [4, 7] and is composed of a two stage deterministic - heuristic part and of a optional stochastic optimization. This algorithm is able to scale up well to handle huge datasets with faster performance than the competing technologies such as BEAGLE[5] and MACH[10] while maintaining a comparable accuracy. A quality assessment of the results is carried out by comparing the switch error. Finally, the haplotypes are used to perform a haplotype-based Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS). The association results are compared with a multimarker and a single SNP association test performed with Plink [12]. Our experiments confirm that the multimarker association test can be more powerful than the single SNP one as stated in the literature. Moreover, Flash and Plink show similar results for the multimarker association test but Flash speeds up the computation time of about an order of magnitude using 5 SNP size haplotypes.",

    "abstract": "The UK Government has recently been debating whether or not to legislate to allow mitochondrial replacement (MR) to be used in the clinic. However, we are concerned that some of the science of MR has been misunderstood, or otherwise given only fleeting consideration. We set out our arguments below and offer a way forward to ensure that MR can safely deliver the health benefits it promises for those suffering from mitochondrial-related diseases\\n\\nRecent innovations that enable mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations to be eliminated from the germline, by replacing mutated mitochondria within an oocyte with mitochondria from a healthy donor female1-3, offer hope for the eradication of several debilitating and lethal mitochondrial diseases. The potential for clinical application of MR has received widespread support4,5, but has also provoked safety and ethical concerns from the public ...",
