    "abstract": "Neural circuit mapping is generating datasets of 10,000s of labeled neurons. New computational tools are needed to search and organize these data. We present NBLAST, a sensitive and rapid algorithm, for measuring pairwise neuronal similarity. NBLAST considers both position and local geometry, decomposing neurons into short segments; matched segments are scored using a probabilistic scoring matrix defined by statistics of matches and non-matches.\\n\\nWe validated NBLAST on a published dataset of 16,129 single Drosophila neurons. NBLAST can distinguish neuronal types down to the finest level (single identified neurons) without a priori information. Cluster analysis of extensively studied neuronal classes identified new types and un-reported topographical features. Fully automated clustering organized the validation dataset into 1052 clusters, many of which map onto previously described neuronal types. NBLAST supports additional query types including searching neurons against transgene expression patterns. Finally we show that NBLAST is effective with data from other invertebrates and zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian genes are composed of exons, but the evolutionary origins and functions of new internal exons are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed patterns of exon gain using deep cDNA sequencing data from five mammals and one bird, identifying thousands of species- and lineage-specific exons. Most new exons derived from unique rather than repetitive intronic sequence. Unlike exons conserved across mammals, species-specific internal exons were mostly located in 5' untranslated regions and alternatively spliced. They were associated with upstream intronic deletions, increased nucleosome occupancy, and RNA polymerase II pausing. Genes containing new internal exons had increased gene expression, but only in tissues where the exon was included. Increased expression correlated with level of exon inclusion, promoter proximity, and signatures of cotranscriptional splicing. Together these findings suggest that splicing at the 5' ends of genes enhances expression and that changes in 5' end splicing alter gene expression between tissues and between species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that is ubiquitous across many eukaryotes, with variable patterns and functions across taxa. The roles of DNA methylation during invertebrate development remain enigmatic, especially regarding the inheritance and ontogenetic dynamics of methylation. In order to better understand to what degree DNA methylation patterns are heritable, variable between individuals, and changing during Crassostrea gigas development, we characterized the genome-wide methylome of Crassostrea gigas sperm and larvae from two full-sib families nested within a maternal half-sib family across developmental stages.\\n\\nResultsBisulfite treated DNA sequencing of Crassostrea gigas sperm and larvae at 72 hours post fertilization and 120 hours post fertilization revealed DNA methylation ranges from 15-18%. Our data suggest that DNA methylation patterns are inherited, as methylation patterns were more similar between the two sires and their offspring compared to methylations pattern differences among developmental stages. Loci differing between the two paternal full-sib families (189) were found throughout the genome but were concentrated in transposable elements. The proportion of differentially methylated loci among developmental stages was not significantly greater in any genomic region.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study provides the first single-base pair resolution DNA methylomes for both oyster sperm and larval samples from multiple crosses. Assuming DNA methylation is introduced randomly, the predominance of differentially methylated loci between families within transposable elements could be associated with selection against altering methylation in gene bodies. For instance, differentially methylated loci in gene bodies could be lethal or deleterious, as they would alter gene expression. Another possibility is that differentially methylated loci may provide advantageous phenotypic variation by increasing transposable element mobility. Future research should focus on the relationship between epigenetic and genetic variation, and explore the possible relationship of DNA methylation and transposable element activity.",

    "abstract": "The Armenians are a culturally isolated population who historically inhabited a region in the Near East bounded by the Mediterranean and Black seas and the Caucasus, but remain underrepresented in genetic studies and have a complex history including a major geographic displacement during World War One. Here, we analyse genome-wide variation in 173 Armenians and compare them to 78 other worldwide populations. We find that Armenians form a distinctive cluster linking the Near East, Europe, and the Caucasus. We show that Armenian diversity can be explained by several mixtures of Eurasian populations that occurred between [~]3,000 and [~]2,000 BCE, a period characterized by major population migrations after the domestication of the horse, appearance of chariots, and the rise of advanced civilizations in the Near East. However, genetic signals of population mixture cease after [~]1,200 BCE when Bronze Age civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean world suddenly and violently collapsed. Armenians have since remained isolated and genetic structure within the population developed [~]500 years ago when Armenia was divided between the Ottomans and the Safavid Empire in Iran. Finally, we show that Armenians have higher genetic affinity to Neolithic Europeans than other present-day Near Easterners, and that 29% of the Armenian ancestry may originate from an ancestral population best represented by Neolithic Europeans.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular transcriptional regulators and extracellular signaling pathways together regulate the allocation of cell fates during development, but how their molecular activities are integrated to establish the correct proportions of cells with particular fates is not known. Here we study this question in the context of the decision between the epiblast (Epi) and the primitive endoderm (PrE) fate that occurs in the mammalian preimplantation embryo. Using an embryonic stem (ES) cell model, we discover two successive functions of FGF/MAPK signaling in this decision. First, the pathway needs to be inhibited to make the PrE-like gene expression program accessible for activation by GATA transcription factors in ES cells. In a second step, MAPK signaling levels determine the threshold concentration of GATA factors required for PrE-like differentiation, and thereby control the proportion of cells differentiating along this lineage. Our findings can be explained by a simple mutual repression circuit modulated by FGF/MAPK signaling. This may be a general network architecture to integrate the activity of signal transduction pathways and transcriptional regulators, and serve to balance proportions of cell fates in several contexts.",

    "abstract": "The study of gene essentiality in human cells is crucial for elucidating gene function and holds great potential for finding therapeutic targets for diseases such as cancer. Technological advances in genome editing using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 systems have set the stage for identifying human cell line core and context-dependent essential genes. However, first generation negative selection screens using CRISPR technology demonstrate extreme variability across different cell lines. To advance the development of the catalogue of human core and context-dependent essential genes, we have developed an optimized, ultracomplex, genome-scale gRNA library of 176,500 guide RNAs targeting 17,661 genes and have applied it to negative and positive selection screens in a human cell line. Using an improved Bayesian analytical approach, we find CRISPR-based screens yield double to triple the number of essential genes than were previously observed using systematic RNA interference, including many genes at moderate expression levels that are largely refractory to RNAi methods. We further characterized four essential genes of unknown significance and found that they all likely exist in protein complexes with other essential genes. For example, RBM48 and ARMC7 are both essential nuclear proteins, strongly interact and are commonly amplified across major cancers. Our findings suggest the CRISPR-Cas9 system fundamentally alters the landscape for systematic reverse genetics in human cells for elucidating gene function, identifying disease genes, and uncovering therapeutic targets.",
