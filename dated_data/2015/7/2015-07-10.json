    "abstract": "Spinal interneurons are partially phase-locked to physiological tremor around 10Hz. The phase of spinal interneuron activity is approximately opposite to descending drive to motoneurons, leading to partial phase cancellation and tremor reduction. Pre-synaptic inhibition of afferent feedback modulates during voluntary movements, but it is not known whether it tracks more rapid fluctuations in motor output such as during tremor.\\n\\nIn this study, dorsal root potentials (DRPs) were recorded from the C8 and T1 roots in two macaque monkeys following intra-spinal micro-stimulation (random inter-stimulus interval 1.5-2.5 s, 30-100A), whilst the animals performed an index finger flexion task which elicited peripheral oscillations around 10Hz. Forty one responses were identified with latency <5ms; these were narrow (mean width 0.59 ms), and likely resulted from antidromic activation of afferents following stimulation near terminals. Significant modulation during task performance occurred in 16/41 responses, reflecting terminal excitability changes generated by pre-synaptic inhibition (Walls excitability test). Stimuli falling during large-amplitude 8-12Hz oscillations in finger acceleration were extracted, and sub-averages of DRPs constructed for stimuli delivered at different oscillation phases. Although some apparent phase-dependent modulation was seen, this was not above the level expected by chance.\\n\\nWe conclude that although terminal excitability reflecting pre-synaptic inhibition of afferents modulates over the timescale of a voluntary movement, it does not follow more rapid changes in motor output. This suggests that pre-synaptic inhibition is not part of the spinal systems for tremor reduction described previously, and that it plays a role in overall - but not moment-by-moment - regulation of feedback gain.",

    "abstract": "With the growing number of protein structures in the protein data bank (PDB), there is a need to annotate these structures at the domain level in order to relate protein structure to protein function. Thanks to the SIFTS database, many PDB chains are now cross-referenced with Pfam domains and enzyme commission (EC) numbers. However, these annotations do not include any explicit relationship between individual Pfam domains and EC numbers. This article presents a novel statistical training-based method called EC-PSI that can automatically infer high confidence associations between EC numbers and Pfam domains directly from EC-chain associations from SIFTS and from EC-sequence associations from the SwissProt, and TrEMBL databases. By collecting and integrating these existing EC-chain/sequence annotations, our approach is able to infer a total of 8,329 direct EC-Pfam associations with an overall F-measure of 0.819 with respect to the manually curated InterPro database, which we treat here as a \\\"gold standard\\\" reference dataset. Thus, compared to the 1,493 EC-Pfam associations in InterPro, our approach provides a way to find over six times as many high quality EC-Pfam associations completely automatically.",

    "abstract": "Shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing is a widely applicable tool for characterizing the functions that are encoded by microbial communities. Several bioinformatic tools can be used to functionally annotate metagenomes, allowing researchers to draw inferences about the functional potential of the community and to identify putative functional biomarkers. However, little is known about how decisions made during annotation affect the reliability of the results. Here, we use statistical simulations to rigorously assess how to optimize annotation accuracy and speed, given parameters of the input data like read length and library size. We identify best practices in metagenome annotation and use them to guide the development of the Shotgun Metagenome Annotation Pipeline (ShotMAP). ShotMAP is an analytically flexible, end-to-end annotation pipeline that can be implemented either on a local computer or a cloud compute cluster. We use ShotMAP to assess how different annotation databases impact the interpretation of how marine metagenome and metatranscriptome functional capacity changes across seasons. We also apply ShotMAP to data obtained from a clinical microbiome investigation of inflammatory bowel disease. This analysis finds that gut microbiota collected from Crohns disease patients are functionally distinct from gut microbiota collected from either ulcerative colitis patients or healthy controls, with differential abundance of metabolic pathways related to host-microbiome interactions that may serve as putative biomarkers of disease.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMicrobial communities perform a wide variety of functions, from marine photosynthesis to aiding digestion in the human gut. Shotgun \\\"metagenomic\\\" sequencing can be used to sample millions of short DNA sequences from such communities directly, without needing to first culture its constituents in the laboratory. Using these data, researchers can survey which functions are encoded by mapping these short sequences to known protein families and pathways. Several tools for this annotation already exist. But, annotation is a multi-step process that includes identification of genes in a metagenome and determination of the type of protein each gene encodes. We currently know little about how different choices of parameters during annotation influences the final results. In this work, we systematically test how several key decisions affect the accuracy and speed of annotation, and based on these results, develop new software for annotation, which we named ShotMAP. We then use ShotMAP to functionally characterize marine communities and gut communities in a clinical cohort of inflammatory bowel disease. We find several functions are differentially represented in the gut microbiome of Crohns disease patients, which could be candidates for biomarkers and could also offer insight into the pathophysiology of Crohns. ShotMAP is freely available (https://github.com/sharpton/shotmap).",

    "abstract": "When sequencing an ancient DNA sample from a hominin fossil, DNA from present-day humans involved in excavation and extraction will be sequenced along with the endogenous material. This type of contamination is problematic for downstream analyses as it will introduce a bias towards the population of the contaminating individual(s). Quantifying the extent of contamination is a crucial step as it allows researchers to account for possible biases that may arise in downstream genetic analyses. Here, we present an MCMC algorithm to co-estimate the contamination rate, sequencing error rate and demographic parameters - including drift times and admixture rates - for an ancient nuclear genome obtained from human remains, when the putative contaminating DNA comes from present-day humans. We assume we have a large panel representing the putative contaminant population (e.g. European, East Asian or African). The method is implemented in a C++ program called Demographic Inference with Contamination and Error (DICE). We applied it to simulations and genome data from ancient Neanderthals and modern humans. With reasonable levels of genome sequence coverage (> 3X), we find we can recover accurate estimates of all these parameters, even when the contamination rate is as high as 50%.",

    "abstract": "When the ranges of two hybridizing species overlap, individuals may  waste gametes on inviable or infertile hybrids. In these cases, selection against maladaptive hybridization can lead to the evolution of enhanced reproductive isolation in a process called reinforcement. On the slopes of the African island of Sao Tome, Drosophila yakuba and its endemic sister species D. santomea have a well-defined hybrid zone. Drosophila yakuba females from within this zone show increased postmating-prezygotic isolation towards D. santomea males when compared with D. yakuba females from allopatric populations. To understand why reinforced gametic isolation is confined to areas of secondary contact and has not spread throughout the entire D. yakuba geographic range, we studied the costs of reinforcement in D. yakuba using a combination of natural collections and experimental evolution. We found that D. yakuba males from sympatric populations sire fewer progeny than allopatric males when mated to allopatric D. yakuba females. Our results suggest that the correlated evolution of male and female reproductive traits in sympatric D. yakuba have associated costs (i.e., reduced male fertility) that prevent the alleles responsible for enhanced isolation from spreading outside the hybrid zone.",

    "abstract": "We explore solutions for identifying and reconciling taxonomic concepts that take advantage of the powers of computational representation and reasoning without compromising the suitability of the Linnaean system of nomenclature for human communication. Using the model of the semiotic triangle, we show that taxonomic names must variously achieve reference to nomenclatural types, taxonomic concepts (human-created theories of taxonomic identities), and taxa (evolutionary entities in nature). Expansion of the reference models into temporally transitioning systems shows that the elements of each triangle, and provenance among elements across triangles, are only identifiable if taxonomic names and concepts are precisely contextualized. The Codes of nomenclature, by mandating identifier (name) reuse but not requiring concept-specific identifier granularity, leave the challenge of framing and aligning the symbol/reference instances to human communicators who have superior cognitive abilities in this regard. Computers, in turn, can process greater volumes of narrowly framed and logically aligned data. Comparative, taxonomically referenced biological data are becoming increasingly networked and reutilized in analyses that expand their original context of generation. If we expect our virtual comparative information environments to provide logically enabled taxonomic concept provenance services, then we must improve the syntax and semantics of human taxonomy making - for computers.",
