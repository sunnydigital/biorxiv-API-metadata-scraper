    "abstract": "Most proteins show changes in level across growth conditions. Many of these changes seem to be coordinated with the specific growth rate rather than the growth environment or the protein function. Although cellular growth rates, gene expression levels and gene regulation have been at the center of biological research for decades, there are only a few models giving a base line prediction of the dependence of the proteome fraction occupied by a gene with the specific growth rate.\\n\\nWe present a simple model that predicts a widely coordinated increase in the fraction of many proteins out of the proteome, proportionally with the growth rate. The model reveals how passive redistribution of resources, due to active regulation of only a few proteins, can have proteome wide effects that are quantitatively predictable. Our model provides a potential explanation for why and how such a coordinated response of a large fraction of the proteome to the specific growth rate arises under different environmental conditions. The simplicity of our model can also be useful by serving as a baseline null hypothesis in the search for active regulation. We exemplify the usage of the model by analyzing the relationship between growth rate and proteome composition for the model microorganism E.coli as reflected in two recent proteomics data sets spanning various growth conditions. We find that the fraction out of the proteome of a large number of proteins, and from different cellular processes, increases proportionally with the growth rate. Notably, ribosomal proteins, which have been previously reported to increase in fraction with growth rate, are only a small part of this group of proteins. We suggest that, although the fractions of many proteins change with the growth rate, such changes could be part of a global effect, not requiring specific cellular control mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Use of low resolution single cell DNA FISH and population based high resolution chromosome conformation capture techniques have highlighted the importance of pairwise chromatin interactions in gene regulation. However, it is unlikely that these associations act in isolation of other interacting partners within the genome. Indeed, the influence of multi-loci interactions in gene control remains something of an enigma as beyond low-resolution DNA FISH we do not have the appropriate tools to analyze these. Here we present a method that uses standard 4C-seq data to identify multi-loci interactions from the same cell. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method using 4C-seq data sets that identify known pairwise interactions involving the Tcrb and Igk antigen receptor enhancers, in addition to novel tri-loci associations. We further show that enhancer deletions not only interfere with tri-loci interactions in which they participate, but they also disrupt pairwise interactions between other partner enhancers and this disruption is linked to a reduction in their transcriptional output. These findings underscore the functional importance of hubs and provide new insight into chromatin organization as a whole. Our method opens the door for studying multi-loci interactions and their impact on gene regulation in other biological settings.",

Because these models rarely are identifiable from the available data, the uncertainty in physiological parameters may be sampled to create alternative parameterizations of the model, sometimes termed  Virtual Patients. In order to reproduce the statistics of a clinical population, Virtual Patients are often weighted to form a Virtual Population that reflects the baseline characteristics of the clinical cohort. Here we introduce a novel technique to efficiently generate Virtual Patients and, from this ensemble, demonstrate how to select a Virtual Population that matches the observed data without the need for weighting. This approach improves confidence in model predictions by mitigating the risk that spurious Virtual Patients become over-represented in Virtual Populations.",

    "abstract": "A major constraint on the evolution of large body sizes in animals is an increased risk of developing cancer. There is no correlation, however, between body size and cancer risk. This lack of correlation is often referred to as  Petos Paradox. Here we show that the elephant genome encodes 20 copies of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 and that the increase in TP53 copy number occurred coincident with the evolution of large body sizes, the evolution of extreme sensitivity to genotoxic stress, and a hyperactive TP53 signaling pathway in the elephant (Proboscidean) lineage. Furthermore we show that several of the TP53 retrogenes (TP53RTGs) are transcribed and likely translated. While TP53RTGs do not appear to directly function as transcription factors, they do contribute to the enhanced sensitivity of elephant cells to DNA damage and the induction of apoptosis by regulating activity of the TP53 signaling pathway. These results suggest that an increase in the copy number of TP53 may have played a direct role in the evolution of very large body sizes and the resolution of Petos paradox in Proboscideans.",

Cardiac activity can also induce changes in the BOLD signal, thus affect both the number of these events and the mapping between neural events and BOLD signal, namely the hemodynamic response. To isolate neural activity and autonomic effects, we compare the resting state hemodynamic response retrieved by means of a point process analysis with and without deconvolving the cardiac fluctuations. Brainstem and the surrounding cortical area (such as precuneus, insula etc.) are found to be significantly affected by cardiac pulses.

    "abstract": "Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Resistance to first-line empirical monotherapy has emerged, so robust methods are needed to appropriately evaluate the activity of existing and novel antimicrobials against the bacterium. Pharmacodynamic functions, which describe the relationship between the concentration of antimicrobials and the bacterial net growth rate, provide more detailed information than the MIC only. In this study, a novel standardized in vitro time-kill curve assay was developed. The assay was validated using five World Health Organization N. gonorrhoeae reference strains and various concentrations of ciprofloxacin, and then the activity of nine antimicrobials with different target mechanisms were examined against a highly susceptible clinical wild type isolate (cultured in 1964). From the time-kill curves, the bacterial net growth rates at each antimicrobial concentration were estimated. Finally, a pharmacodynamic function was fitted to the data, resulting in four parameters that describe the pharmacodynamic properties of each antimicrobial. Ciprofloxacin resistance determinants shifted the pharmacodynamic MIC (zMIC) and attenuated the bactericidal effect at antimicrobial concentrations above the zMIC. Ciprofloxacin, spectinomycin and gentamicin had the strongest bactericidal effect during the first six hours of the assay. Only tetracycline and chloramphenicol showed a purely bacteriostatic effect. The pharmacodynamic functions differed between antimicrobials, showing that the effect of the drugs at concentrations below and above the MIC vary widely. In conclusion, N. gonorrhoeae time-kill curve experiments analyzed with pharmacodynamic functions have potential for in vitro evaluation of new and existing antimicrobials and dosing strategies to treat gonorrhea.",

In this manuscript, we introduce GenoSkyline, an unsupervised learning framework to predict tissue-specific functional regions through integrating high-throughput epigenetic annotations. GenoSkyline successfully identified a variety of non-coding regulatory machinery including enhancers, regulatory miRNA, and hypomethylated transposable elements in extensive case studies. Integrative analysis of GenoSkyline annotations and results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) led to novel biological insights on the etiologies of a number of human complex traits. We also explored using tissue-specific functional annotations to prioritize GWAS signals and predict relevant tissue types for each risk locus. Brain and blood-specific annotations led to better prioritization performance for schizophrenia than standard GWAS p-values and non-tissue-specific annotations. As for coronary artery disease, heart-specific functional regions was highly enriched of GWAS signals, but previously identified risk loci were found to be most functional in other tissues, suggesting a substantial proportion of still undetected heart-related loci. In summary, GenoSkyline annotations can guide genetic studies at multiple resolutions and provide valuable insights in understanding complex diseases.

    "abstract": "Non-protein-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in cell physiology, with a diverse repertoire of known functions. In fact, the majority of the eukaryotic genome does not code for proteins, and thousands of conserved long non-protein-coding RNAs of currently unkown function have been identified. When available, knowledge of their 3D structure is very helpful in elucidating the function of these RNAs. However, despite some outstanding structure elucidation of RNAs using X-ray crystallography, NMR and cryoEM, learning RNA 3D structures remains low-throughput. RNA structure prediction in silico is a promising alternative approach and works well for double-helical stems, but full 3D structure determination requires tertiary contacts outside of secondary structures that are difficult to infer from sequence information. Here, based only on information from RNA multiple sequence alignments, we use a global statistical sequence probability model of co-variation in a pairs of nucleotide positions to detect 3D contacts, in analogy to recently developed breakthrough methods for computational protein folding. In blinded tests on 22 known RNA structures ranging in size from 65 to 1800 nucleotides, the predicted contacts matched physical nucleotide interactions with 65-95% true positive prediction accuracy. Importantly, we infer many long-range tertiary contacts, including non-Watson-Crick interactions, where secondary structure elements assemble in 3D. When used as restraints in molecular dynamics simulations, the inferred contacts improve RNA 3D structure prediction to a coordinate error as low as 6 - 10 [A] rmsd deviation in atom positions, with potential for further refinement by molecular dynamics. These contacts include functionally important interactions, such as those that distinguish the active and inactive conformations of four riboswitches. In blind prediction mode, we present evolutionary couplings suitable for folding simulations for 180 RNAs of unknown structure, available at https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/ev_rna/. We anticipate that this approach can help shed light on the structure and function of non-protein-coding RNAs as well as 3D-structured mRNAs.",

    "abstract": "1.Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) in eukaryotic plastids and mitochondrial genomes is common, and plays an important role in organism evolution. In yeasts, recent mitochondrial HGT has been suggested between S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus. However, few strains have been explored due to the lack of accurate mitochondrial genome annotations. Mitochondrial genome sequences are important to understand how frequent these introgressions occur and their role in cytonuclear incompatibilities and fitness. In fact, most of the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller genetic incompatibilities described in yeasts are driven by cytonuclear incompatibilities. In this study, we have explored the mitochondrial inheritance of several worldwide distributed Saccharomyces species isolated from different sources and geographic origins. We demonstrated the existence of several recombination points in the mitochondrial region COX2-ORF1, likely mediated by the transfer of two different types of ORF1 (F-SceIII), encoding a freestanding homing endonuclease, or mostly facilitated by A+T tandem repeats and regions of integration of GC clusters. These introgressions were shown to occur at intra- as well as at interspecific levels. This suggest a complex model of Saccharomyces evolution which involve several ancestral hybridization events in wild environments.",

Although this complexity is often resolved by defining generic, alternative and partial reactions, we have also found individual EC numbers with more than one reaction catalysing different types of bond changes. This analysis adds a new dimension to our understanding of enzyme function and might be useful for the accurate annotation of the function of enzymes and to study the changes in enzyme function during evolution.",

    "abstract": "The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1 results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.",

I found that grackles are behaviorally flexible and good problem solvers, they vary in behavioral flexibility across contexts, flexibility did not correlate with problem solving ability, and those that are more flexible did not necessarily use more learning strategies. It appears that behavioral flexibility can be an independent trait that varies across contexts. Maintaining such a high level of variation could be a mechanism underlying successful species invasions.
