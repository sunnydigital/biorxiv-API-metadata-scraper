    "abstract": "The engineering of transcriptional networks presents many challenges due to the inherent uncertainty in the system structure, changing cellular context and stochasticity in the governing dynamics. One approach to address these problems is to design and build systems that can function across a range of conditions; that is they are robust to uncertainty in their constituent components. Here we examine the robustness landscape of transcriptional oscillators, which underlie many important processes such as circadian rhythms and the cell cycle, plus also serve as a model for the engineering of complex and emergent phenomena. The central questions that we address are: Can we build genetic oscillators that are more robust than those already constructed? Can we make genetic oscillators arbitrarily robust? These questions are technically challenging due to the large model and parameter spaces that must be efficiently explored. Here we use a measure of robustness that coincides with the Bayesian model evidence combined with an efficient Monte Carlo method to traverse model space and concentrate on regions of high robustness, which enables the accurate evaluation of the relative structural robustness of gene network models governed by stochastic dynamics. We report the most robust two and three gene oscillator systems, plus examine how the number of interactions, the presence of auto-regulation, and degradation of mRNA and protein affects the frequency, amplitude and robustness of transcriptional oscillators. We also find that there is a limit to parametric robustness, beyond which there is nothing to be gained by adding additional feedback. Importantly, we provide predictions on new oscillator systems that can be constructed to verify the theory and advance design and modelling approaches to systems and synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "Study question: How does a genetic variant altering follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, which we identified as associated with length of menstrual cycle, more widely impact reproductive health?\\n\\nSummary answer: The T allele of the FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638) results in longer menstrual cycles and later menopause and, while having detrimental effects on fertility, is protective against endometriosis.\\n\\nWhat is known already: The FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638) affects levels of FSHB transcription and, as a result, levels of FSH. FSH is required for normal fertility and genetic variants at the FSHB locus are associated with age at menopause and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\\n\\nStudy design, size, duration: We conducted a genetic association study using cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank.\\n\\nParticipants/materials, setting, methods: We included white British individuals aged 40-69 years in 2006-2010, included in the May 2015 release of genetic data from UK Biobank. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 9,534 individuals to identify genetic variants associated with length of menstrual cycle. We tested the FSH lowering T allele of the FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638) for associations with 29 reproductive phenotypes in up to 63,350 individuals.\\n\\nMain results and the role of chance: In the GWAS for menstrual cycle length, only variants near the FSHB gene reached genome-wide significance (P<5x10-8). The FSH-lowering T allele of the FSHB promoter polymorphism (rs10835638G>T; MAF 0.16) was associated with longer menstrual cycles (0.16 s.d. (approx. 1 day) per minor allele; 95% CI 0.12-0.20; P=6x10-16), later age at menopause (0.13 years per minor allele; 95% CI 0.04-0.22; P=5.7x10-3), greater female nulliparity (OR=1.06; 95% CI 1.02-1.11; P=4.8x10-3) and lower risk of endometriosis (OR=0.79; 95% CI 0.69-0.90; P=4.1x10-4). The FSH-lowering T allele was not associated more generally with other reproductive illnesses or conditions and we did not replicate associations with male infertility or PCOS.\\n\\nLimitations, reasons for caution: The data included might be affected by recall bias. Women with a cycle length recorded were aged over 40 and were approaching menopause, however we did not find evidence that this affected the results. Many of the illnesses had relatively small sample sizes and so we may have been under-powered to detect an effect.\\n\\nWider implications of the findings: We found a strong novel association between a genetic variant that lowers FSH levels and longer menstrual cycles, at a locus previously robustly associated with age at menopause. The variant was also associated with nulliparity and endometriosis risk. We conclude that lifetime differences in circulating levels of FSH between individuals can influence menstrual cycle length and a range of reproductive outcomes, including menopause timing, infertility, endometriosis and PCOS.",

    "abstract": "The social network structure of animal populations has major implications for survival, reproductive success, sexual selection, and pathogen transmission of individuals. But as of yet, no general theory of social network structure exists that can explain the diversity of social networks observed in nature, and serve as a null model for detecting species and population-specific factors. Here we propose a simple and generally applicable model of social network structure. We consider the emergence of network structure as a result of social inheritance, in which newborns are likely to bond with maternal contacts, and via forming bonds randomly. We compare model output to data from several species, showing that it can generate networks with properties such as those observed in real social systems. Our model demonstrates that important observed properties of social networks, including heritability of network position or assortative associations, can be understood as consequences of social inheritance.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by substantial phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, which greatly complicates the identification of genetic factors that contribute to the disease. Study designs have mainly focused on group differences between cases and controls. The problem is that, by their nature, group difference-based methods (e.g., differential expression analysis) blur or collapse the heterogeneity within groups. By ignoring genes with variable within-group expression, an important axis of genetic heterogeneity contributing to expression variability among affected individuals has been overlooked. To this end, we develop a new gene expression analysis method--aberrant gene expression analysis, based on the multivariate distance commonly used for outlier detection. Our method detects the discrepancies in gene expression dispersion between groups and identifies genes with significantly different expression variability. Using this new method, we re-visited RNA sequencing data generated from post-mortem brain tissues of 47 ASD and 57 control samples. We identified 54 functional gene sets whose expression dispersion in ASD samples is more pronounced than that in controls, as well as 76 co-expression modules present in controls but absent in ASD samples due to ASD-specific aberrant gene expression. We also exploited aberrantly expressed genes as biomarkers for ASD diagnosis. With a whole blood expression data set, we identified three aberrantly expressed gene sets whose expression levels serve as discriminating variables achieving >70% classification accuracy. In summary, our method represents a novel discovery and diagnostic strategy for ASD. Our findings may help open an expression variability-centered research avenue for other genetically heterogeneous disorders.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of cooperation in group-structured populations has received much attention, but little is known about the effects of different modes of migration of individuals between groups. Here, we have incorporated four different modes of migration that differ in the degree of coordination among the individuals. For each mode of migration, we identify the set of multiplayer games in which the cooperative strategy has higher fixation probability than defection. The comparison shows that the set of games under which cooperation may evolve generally expands depending upon the degree of coordination among the migrating individuals. Weak altruism can evolve under all modes of individual migration, provided that the benefit to cost ratio is high enough. Strong altruism, however, evolves only if the mode of migration involves coordination of individual actions. Depending upon the migration frequency and degree of coordination among individuals, conditions that allow selection to work at the level of groups can be established.",

    "abstract": "Regularities in animal behaviour offer insight into the underlying organisational and functional principles of nervous systems and automated tracking provides the opportunity to extract features of behaviour directly from large-scale video data. Yet how to effectively analyse such behavioural data remains an open question. Here we explore whether a minimum description length principle can be exploited to identify meaningful behaviours and phenotypes. We apply a dictionary compression algorithm to behavioural sequences from the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans freely crawling on an agar plate both with and without food and during chemotaxis. We find that the motifs identified by the compression algorithm are rare but relevant for comparisons between worms in different environments, suggesting that hierarchical compression can be a useful step in behaviour analysis. We also use compressibility as a new quantitative phenotype and find that the behaviour of wild-isolated strains of C. elegans is more compressible than that of the laboratory strain N2 as well as the majority of mutant strains examined. Importantly, in distinction to more conventional phenotypes such as overall motor activity or aggregation behaviour, the increased compressibility of wild isolates is not explained by the loss of function of the gene npr-1, which suggests that erratic locomotion is a laboratory-derived trait with a novel genetic basis. Because hierarchical compression can be applied to any sequence, we anticipate that compressibility can offer insight into the organisation of behaviour in other animals including humans.",

In mouse, after the fetal phase of rapid HSCs expansion, the number of these stem cells continues to increase after birth in order to sustain the growing blood volume of the developing infant. The number of total circulating reticulocytes seems to indicate that this growth stops around the third week of murine life, well before the whole animal stops to grow. Around the same time, a period of abundant lymphopoiesis ends. Human HSCs seem to show similar patterns during post-natal growth and these could be useful to understand the peculiar features of paediatric leukaemogenesis.",
