    "abstract": "The classical class I HLA loci of humans show an excess of nonsynonymous with respect to synonymous substitutions at codons of the antigen recognition site (ARS), a hallmark of adaptive evolution. Additionally, high polymporphism, linkage disequilibrium and disease associations suggest that one or more balancing selection regimes have acted upon these genes. However, several questions about these selective regimes remain open. First, it is unclear if stronger evidence for selection on deep timescales is due to changes in the intensity of selection over time or to a lack of power of most methods to detect selection on recent timescales. Another question concerns the functional entities which define the selected phenotype. While most analysis focus on selection acting on individual alleles, it is also plausible that phylogenetically defined groups of alleles (\\\"lineages\\\") are targets of selection. To address these questions we analyzed how dN/dS ({omega}) varies with respect to divergence times between alleles and phylogenetic placement (position of branches). We find that{omega} for ARS codons of class I HLA genes increases with divergence time and is higher for inter-lineage branches. Throughout our analyses, we used non-selected codons to control for possible effects of inflation of{omega} associated to intra-specific analysis, and showed that our results are not artifactual. Our findings indicate the importance of considering the timescale effect when analysing{omega} over a wide spectrum of divergences. Finally, our results support the divergent allele advantage model, whereby heterozygotes with more divergent alleles have higher fitness than those carrying similar alleles.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 2-4% of genetic material in human populations outside Africa is derived from Neanderthals who interbred with anatomically modern humans. Recent studies have shown that this Neanderthal DNA is depleted around functional genomic regions; this has been suggested to be a consequence of harmful epistatic interactions between human and Neanderthal alleles. However, using published estimates of Neanderthal inbreeding and the distribution of mutational fitness effects, we infer that Neanderthals had at least 40% lower fitness than humans on average; this increased load predicts the reduction in Neanderthal introgression around genes without the need to invoke epistasis. We also predict a residual Neanderthal mutational load in non-Africans, leading to a fitness reduction of at least 0.5%. This effect of Neanderthal admixture has been left out of previous debate on mutation load differences between Africans and non-Africans. We also show that if many deleterious mutations are recessive, the Neanderthal admixture fraction could increase over time due to the protective effect of Neanderthal haplotypes against deleterious alleles that arose recently in the human population. This might partially explain why so many organisms retain gene flow from other species and appear to derive adaptive benefits from introgression.",

Conducting simulation studies can become a complicated task as several challenges can occur, such as the selection of an appropriate simulation tool and the specification of parameters in the simulation model. Although abundant simulated data have been generated for human genetic research, currently there is no public database designed specifically as a repository for these simulated data. With the lack of such database, for similar studies, similar simulations may have been repeated, which resulted in redundant works. We created an online platform, DBSIM, for simulation data sharing and discussion of simulation techniques for human genetic studies. DBSIM has a database containing simulation scripts, simulated data, and documentations from published manuscripts, as well as a discussion forum, which provides a platform for discussion of the simulated data and exchanging simulation ideas. DBSIM will be useful in three aspects. Moreover, summary statistics such as the simulation tools that are most commonly used and datasets that are most frequently downloaded are provided. The statistics will be very informative for researchers to choose an appropriate simulation tool or select a common dataset for method comparisons.

    "abstract": "Biological introductions bring into contact species that can still hybridize. The evolutionary outcomes of such secondary contacts may be diverse (e.g. adaptive introgression from or into the introduced species) but are not yet well examined in the wild. The recent secondary contact between the non-native sea squirt Ciona robusta (formerly known as C. intestinalis type A) and its native congener C. intestinalis (formerly known as C. intestinalis type B), in the western English Channel, provides an excellent case study to examine. To examine contemporary hybridization between the two species, we developed a panel of 310 ancestry-informative SNPs from a population transcriptomic study. Hybridization rates were examined on 449 individuals sampled in 8 sites from the sympatric range and 5 sites from allopatric ranges. The results clearly showed an almost complete absence of contemporary hybridization between the two species in syntopic localities, with only one first generation hybrid and no other genotype compatible with recent backcrosses. Despite the almost lack of contemporary hybridization, shared polymorphisms were observed in sympatric and allopatric populations of both species. Furthermore, one allopatric population from SE Pacific exhibited a higher rate of shared polymorphisms compared to all other C. robusta populations. Altogether, these results indicate that the observed level of shared polymorphism is more probably the outcome of ancient gene flow spread afterwards at a worldwide scale. They also emphasise efficient reproductive barriers preventing hybridization between introduced and native species, which suggests hybridization should not impede too much the expansion and the establishment of the non-native species in its introduction range.",

Here we describe the aggregation and analysis of high-quality exome (protein-coding region) sequence data for 60,706 individuals of diverse ethnicities generated as part of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). The resulting catalogue of human genetic diversity contains an average of one variant every eight bases of the exome, and provides direct evidence for the presence of widespread mutational recurrence. We show that this catalogue can be used to calculate objective metrics of pathogenicity for sequence variants, and to identify genes subject to strong selection against various classes of mutation; we identify 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion of truncating variants, 72% of which have no currently established human disease phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that these data can be used for the efficient filtering of candidate disease-causing variants, and for the discovery of human \\\"knockout\\\" variants in protein-coding genes.",

The most commonly used package for constructing SBML models in Python is python-libSBML based on the C/C++ library libSBML. python-libSBML supports a comprehensive set of model types, but is difficult for new users to learn and requires long scripts to create even the simplest models. We present SimpleSBML, a package that allows users to add species, parameters, reactions, events, and rules to a libSBML model with only one command for each. Models can be exported to SBML format, and SBML files can be imported and converted to SimpleSBML commands that creates each element in a new model. This allows users to create new models and edit existing models for use with other software.\n\nAccessibility and ImplementationSimpleSBML is publicly available and licensed under the liberal Apache 2.0 open source license.

    "abstract": "All animals are able to rapidly change their behavior. The neural basis of such flexibility requires that groups of distant neural ensembles rapidly alter communications with selectivity and fidelity. Low frequency oscillations are a strong candidate for how neurons coordinate communication via the dynamic instantiation of functional networks. These dynamic networks are argued to rapidly guide the flow of information, with the presumption that stronger oscillations more strongly influence information flow. Surprisingly, there is scant evidence or theoretical support for how oscillatory activity might enhance information flow. Here we introduce a novel computational model for oscillatory neural communication and show that, rather than the strength of the oscillation, it is the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity that has the largest effect on information flow. When coupling between an oscillation and spiking has balanced excitatory-inhibitory inputs, information flow is enhanced via improved discriminability between signal and noise. In contrast, when coupling is unbalanced, driven either by excessive excitation or inhibition, information flow is obstructed, regardless of the strength of the oscillation. A multitude of neuropathologies, including Parkinsons disease, schizophrenia, and autism, are associated with oscillatory disruptions and excitation-inhibition imbalances. Our results show that understanding the distinction between balanced and unbalanced oscillatory coupling offers a unifying mechanistic framework for understanding effective neural communication and its disruption in neuropathology.",

Understanding how the interactions between tumour and stromal cells determine successful metastases and how metastatic tumours respond to treatment is an emergent process that is hard to asses biologically and thus can benefit from mathematical models. In this work we describe a mathematical model of bone remodelling and the establishment of a prostate cancer metastasis in the bone using evolutionary game theory. We have mathematically recapitulated the current paradigm of a vicious cycle driving the tumor growth and we have used this tool to investigate the key interactions between the tumour and the bone stroma. Crucially, the model sheds light on the role that the interactions of heterogeneous tumor cells with the bone microenvironment have in the treatment of cancer. Our results show that resistant populations naturally become dominant in the metastases under a number treatment schemes and that schedules designed by an evolutionary game theory approach could be used to better control the tumour and the associated bone growth than the current standard of care.",

(2005a) refer to as \\\"genetic indistinguishability\\\". This phenomenon can complicate genotype-phenotype association testing by hindering the ability to localize causal alleles, but has not been thoroughly explored from a theoretical perspective or using large, dense whole-genome polymorphism datasets. We derive a simple theoretical model of the prevalence of genetic indistinguishability between unlinked loci, and verify its accuracy via simulation. We show that sample size and minor allele frequency are the major determinants of the prevalence of perfect LD between unlinked loci but that demographic factors, such as deviations from random mating, can produce significant effects as well. Finally, we quantify this phenomenon in three model organisms and find thousands of pairs of moderate-frequency (> 5%) genetically indistinguishable variants in relatively large datasets. These results clarify a previously underexplored population genetic phenomenon with important implications for association studies, and define conditions under which it is likely to manifest.",

For k = 4, correlations for clusters 1-4, respectively, ranged between 0.77-0.85, 0.83-0.89, 0.51-0.76, and 0.61-0.75. Within populations, comparing analogous clusters (k = 3 versus k = 4), correlations were high for clusters 1 and 2 (0.91-1.00), but were lower for cluster 3 (0.22-0.80). Results are similar using non-negative matrix factorization. SC1 corresponds to previously-reported mesenchymal-like, SC2 to proliferative-like, SC3 to immunoreactive-like, and SC4 to differentiated-like subtypes.\\n\\nConclusionsThe mesenchymal-like and proliferative-like subtypes are remarkably consistent across populations and could be uniquely targeted for treatment. The other two previously described subtypes are considerably less robust, and since cross-population comparison reveals that k = 3 and k = 4 are both consistent with our results, they may not represent clear subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization between humans and Neanderthals has resulted in a low level of Neanderthal ancestry scattered across the genomes of many modern-day humans. After hybridization, on average, selection appears to have removed Neanderthal alleles from the human population. Quantifying the strength and causes of this selection against Neanderthal ancestry is key to understanding our relationship to Neanderthals and, more broadly, how populations remain distinct after secondary contact. Here, we develop a novel method for estimating the genome-wide average strength of selection and the density of selected sites using estimates of Neanderthal allele frequency along the genomes of modern-day humans. We confirm that East Asians had somewhat higher initial levels of Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans even after accounting for selection. We find that the bulk of purifying selection against Neanderthal ancestry is best understood as acting on many weakly deleterious alleles. We propose that the majority of these alleles were effectively neutral--and segregating at high frequency--in Neanderthals, but became selected against after entering human populations of much larger effective size. While individually of small effect, these alleles potentially imposed a heavy genetic load on the early-generation human-Neanderthal hybrids. This work suggests that differences in effective population size may play a far more important role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA small percentage of Neanderthal DNA is present in the genomes of many contemporary human populations due to hybridization tens of thousands of years ago. Much of this Neanderthal DNA appears to be deleterious in humans, and natural selection is acting to remove it. One hypothesis is that the underlying alleles were not deleterious in Neanderthals, but rather represent genetic incompatibilities that became deleterious only once they were introduced to the human population. If so, reproductive barriers must have evolved rapidly between Neanderthals and humans after their split. Here, we show that oberved patterns of Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans can be explained simply as a consequence of the difference in effective population size between Neanderthals and humans. Specifically, we find that on average, selection against individual Neanderthal alleles is very weak. This is consistent with the idea that Neanderthals over time accumulated many weakly deleterious alleles that in their small population were effectively neutral. However, after introgressing into larger human populations, those alleles became exposed to purifying selection. Thus, rather than being the result of hybrid incompatibilities, differences between human and Neanderthal effective population sizes appear to have played a key role in shaping our present-day shared ancestry.",
