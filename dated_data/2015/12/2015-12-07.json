    "abstract": "Population expansions trigger many biomedical and ecological transitions, from tumor growth to invasions of non-native species. Although population spreading often selects for more invasive phenotypes, we show that this outcome is far from inevitable. In cooperative populations, mutations reducing dispersal have a competitive advantage. Such mutations then steadily accumulate at the expansion front bringing invasion to a halt. Our findings are a rare example of evolution driving the population into an unfavorable state and could lead to new strategies to combat unwelcome invaders. In addition, we obtain an exact analytical expression for the fitness advantage of mutants with different dispersal rates.\\n\\nPACS numbers: 87.23.Kg, 05.60.Cd, 64.60.-i, 87.23.Cc",

    "abstract": "Along with the development of several large-scale methods such as mass spectrometry or micro arrays, genome wide models became not only a possibility but an obvious tool for theoretical biologists to integrate and analyse complex biological data. Nevertheless, incorporating the dynamics of photosynthesis remains one of the major challenges while reconstructing metabolic networks of plants and other photosynthetic organisms. In this review, we aim to provide arguments that small-scale models are still a suitable choice when it comes to discover organisational principles governing the design of biological systems. We give a brief overview of recent modelling efforts in understanding the interplay between rapid, photoprotective mechanisms and the redox balance within the thylakoid membrane, discussing the applicability of a reductionist approach in modelling self-regulation in plants, and outline possible directions for further research.",

    "abstract": "Most spontaneous mutations affecting fitness are likely to be deleterious, but the strength of selection acting on them might be impacted by environmental stress. Such stress-dependent selection could expose hidden genetic variation, which in turn might increase the adaptive potential of stressed populations. On the other hand, this variation might represent a genetic load and thus lead to population extinction under stress. Previous studies to determine the link between stress and mutational effects on fitness, however, have produced inconsistent results. Here, we determined the net change in fitness in 29 genotypes of the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that accumulated mutations in the near absence of selection for approximately 1,000 generations across two stress gradients, increasing NaCl and decreasing phosphate. We found mutational effects to be magnified under extremely stressful conditions, but such effects were specific both to the type of stress as well as to the genetic background. The detection of stress-dependent fitness effects of mutations depended on accurately scaling relative fitness measures by generation times, thus offering an explanation for the inconsistencies among previous studies.",

    "abstract": "Structural connectivity among cortical areas provides the substrate for information exchange in the brain and is characterized by the presence or absence of connections between specific areas. What principles govern this cortical wiring diagram? Here, we investigate the relation of physical distance and cytoarchitecture with the connectional architecture of the mouse cortex. Moreover, we examine the relation between patterns of ipsilateral and contralateral connections. Our analysis reveals a mirrored and attenuated organization of contralateral connections when compared to ipsilateral connections. Both spatial proximity and cytoarchitectonic similarity of cortical areas are related to the presence or absence of connections. Notably, our analysis demonstrated that these factors conjointly relate better to cortico-cortical connectivity than each factor in isolation, and that the two factors contribute differently to ipsilateral and contralateral connectivity. Distance is more tightly related to the presence or absence of ipsilateral connections, but its contribution greatly diminishes for contralateral connections, while the contribution of cytoarchitectonic similarity remains stable. Our results, conjointly with similar findings in the cat and macaque cortex, suggest that a common set of principles underlies the macroscale wiring of mammalian brains.",

    "abstract": "Measures of population differentiation, such as FST, are traditionally derived from the partition of diversity within and between populations. However, the emergence of population clusters from multilocus analysis is a function of genetic structure (departures from panmixia) rather than of diversity. If the populations are close to panmixia, slight differences between the mean pairwise distance within and between populations (low FST) can manifest as strong separation between the populations, thus population clusters are often evident even when the vast majority of diversity is partitioned within populations rather than between them. For any given FST value, clusters can be tighter (more panmictic) or looser (more stratified), and in this respect higher FST does not always imply stronger differentiation. In this study we propose a measure for the partition of structure, denoted EST, which is more consistent with results from clustering schemes. Crucially, our measure is based on a statistic of the data that is a good measure of internal structure, mimicking the information extracted by unsupervised clustering or dimensionality reduction schemes. To assess the utility of our metric, we ranked various human (HGDP) population pairs based on FST and EST and found substantial differences in ranking order. In some cases examined, most notably among isolated Amazonian tribes, EST ranking seems more consistent with demographic, phylogeographic and linguistic measures of classification compared to FST. Thus, EST may at times outperform FST in identifying evolutionary significant differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Organismal functions are size-dependent whenever body surfaces supply body volumes. Larger organisms can develop strongly folded internal surfaces for enhanced diffusion, but in many cases areas cannot be folded so that their enlargement is constrained by anatomy, presenting a problem for larger animals. Here, we study the allometry of adhesive pad area in 225 climbing animal species, covering more than seven orders of magnitude in weight. Across all taxa, adhesive pad area showed extreme positive allometry and scaled with weight, implying a 200-fold increase of relative pad area from mites to geckos. However, allometric scaling coefficients for pad area systematically decreased with taxonomic level, and were close to isometry when evolutionary history was accounted for, indicating that the substantial anatomical changes required to achieve increases in relative pad area are limited by phylogenetic constraints. Using a comparative phylogenetic approach, we found that the departure from isometry is almost exclusively caused by large differences in size-corrected pad area between arthropods and vertebrates. To mitigate the expected decrease of weight-specific adhesion within closely related taxa where pad area scaled close to isometry, data for several taxa suggest that the pads adhesive strength increased for larger animals. The combination of adjustments in relative pad area for distantly related taxa and changes in adhesive strength for closely related groups helps explain how climbing with adhesive pads has evolved in animals varying over seven orders of magnitude in body weight. Our results illustrate the size limits of adhesion-based climbing, with profound implications for large-scale bio-inspired adhesives.",

    "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are a heterogeneous group of cancers affecting multiple subsites, including oral cavity. Oral or anterior tongue tumors (OTSCC) are an aggressive group of squamous cell carcinomas, characterized by their early spread to lymph nodes and higher rate of regional failure compared to other oral cavity cancers. There is a rise in the incidence of oral tongue cancer among younger population (<50yrs); many of who lack the typical associated risk factors of alcohol and/or tobacco exposure. In order to carry out an ensemble learning and prediction method with multiple parameters classifying survival, we generated data, on somatic mutations in genes from exome sequencing, immediate upstream and downstream flanking nucleotides of the somatic mutations, DNA methylation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), copy number variations (CNV), gene expression, significant pathways altered and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection, from 50 OTSCC patients. Results of our analysis identified somatic mutations in NOTCH2 and/or TP53, and/or LOH in 11p to associate with better disease free survival in HPV positive patients (P = 0.0254) and not in HPV negative patients (P = 0.414). We validated the latter in patients without HPV infection from TCGA cohort (P = 0.369, N = 17 for TCGA_ OralTongue; P = 0.472, N = 67 for all TCGA_HNSCC patients).

    "abstract": "Pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) additions to soils can have large impacts on soil organic C (SOC) cycling. Because the soil microbial community drives SOC fluxes, understanding how PyOM additions affect soil microbes is essential to understanding how PyOM affects SOC. We studied SOC dynamics and surveyed soil microbial communities after OM additions in a field experiment. We produced and applied either 350{degrees}C corn stover PyOM or an equivalent amount of dried corn stover to a Typic Fragiudept soil. Stover increased SOC-derived and total CO2 fluxes (up to 6x), and caused rapid and persistent changes in bacterial community composition over 82 days. In contrast, PyOM only temporarily increased total soil CO2 fluxes (up to 2x) and caused fewer changes in bacterial community composition. 70% of the OTUs that increased in response to PyOM additions also responded to stover additions. These OTUs likely thrive on easily-mineralizable C that is found both in stover and, to a lesser extent, in PyOM. In contrast, we also identified unique PyOM-responders, which may respond to substrates such as polyaromatic C. In particular, members of Gemmatimonadetes tended to increase in relative abundance in response to PyOM but not to fresh organic matter. We identify taxa to target for future investigations of the mechanistic underpinnings of ecological phenomena associated with PyOM additions to soil.",

    "abstract": "X-ray diffraction has the potential to provide rich information about the structural dynamics of macromolecules. To realize this potential, both Bragg scattering, which is currently used to derive macromolecular structures, and diffuse scattering, which reports on correlations in charge density variations must be measured. Until now measurement of diffuse scattering from protein crystals has been scarce, due to the extra effort of collecting diffuse data. Here, we present three-dimensional measurements of diffuse intensity collected from crystals of the enzymes cyclophilin A and trypsin. The measurements were obtained from the same X-ray diffraction images as the Bragg data, using best practices for standard data collection. To model the underlying dynamics in a practical way that could be used during structure refinement, we tested Translation-Libration-Screw (TLS), Liquid-Like Motions (LLM), and coarse-grained Normal Modes (NM) models of protein motions. The LLM model provides a global picture of motions and were refined against the diffuse data, while the TLS and NM models provide more detailed and distinct descriptions of atom displacements, and only used information from the Bragg data. Whereas different TLS groupings yielded similar Bragg intensities, they yielded different diffuse intensities, none of which agreed well with the data. In contrast, both the LLM and NM models agreed substantially with the diffuse data. These results demonstrate a realistic path to increase the number of diffuse datasets available to the wider biosciences community and indicate that NM-based refinement can generate dynamics-inspired structural models that simultaneously agree with both Bragg and diffuse scattering.\\n\\nSignificanceThe structural details of protein motions are critical to understanding many biological processes, but they are often hidden to conventional biophysical techniques. Diffuse X-ray scattering can reveal details of the correlated movements between atoms; however, the data collection historically has required extra effort and dedicated experimental protocols. We have measured three-dimensional diffuse intensities in X-ray diffraction from CypA and trypsin crystals using standard crystallographic data collection techniques. Analysis of the resulting data is consistent with the protein motions resembling diffusion in a liquid or vibrations of a soft solid. Our results show that using diffuse scattering to model protein motions can become a component of routine crystallographic analysis through the extension of commonplace methods.",

    "abstract": "How does experience inform decisions? In episodic sampling, decisions are guided by a few episodic memories of past choices. This process can yield choice patterns similar to model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL); however, samples can vary from trial to trial, causing decisions to vary. Here, we show that context retrieved during episodic sampling can cause choice behavior to deviate sharply from the predictions of RL. Specifically, we show that, when a given memory is sampled, choices (in the present) are influenced by the properties of other decisions made in the same context as the sampled event. This effect is mediated by fMRI measures of context retrieval on each trial, suggesting a mechanism whereby cues trigger retrieval of context, which then triggers retrieval of other decisions from that context. This result establishes a new avenue by which experience can guide choice, and as such has broad implications for the study of decisions.",
