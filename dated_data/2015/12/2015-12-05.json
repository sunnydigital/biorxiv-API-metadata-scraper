    "abstract": "We develop an overarching framework that combines long-term tag-recapture data and powerful statistical and modeling techniques to investigate how population, environmental, and climate factors determine variation in vital rates and population dynamics in an animal species, using as a model system the population of brown trout living in Upper Volaja (Western Slovenia). This population has been monitored since 2004; Upper Volaja is also a sink, receiving individuals from a source population living above a waterfall. We estimate the numerical contribution of the source population on the sink population and test the effects of temperature, population density, and extreme events on variation in vital rates among more than 2,500 individually tagged brown trout. We found that fish dispersing downstream from the source population help maintain high population densities in the sink population despite poor recruitment. The best model of survival for individuals older than juveniles includes additive effects of year-of-birth and time. Fast growth of older cohorts and higher population densities in 2004-2005 suggest very low population densities in late1990s, which we hypothesize were caused by a flash flood that strongly reduced population size and created the habitat conditions for faster growth and transient higher population densities after the extreme event.",

    "abstract": "Different types of phenotypic traits consistently exhibit different levels of genetic variation in natural populations. There are two potential explanations: either mutation produces genetic variation at different rates, or natural selection removes or promotes genetic variation at different rates. Whether mutation or selection is of greater general importance is a longstanding unresolved question in evolutionary genetics. Where the input of genetic variation by mutation differs between traits, it is usually uncertain whether the difference is the result of different mutational effects (\\\"mutational robustness\\\") or different numbers of underlying loci (\\\"mutational target\\\"), although conventional wisdom favors the latter. We report mutational variances (VM) for 19 traits related to the first mitotic cell division in C. elegans, and compare them to the standing genetic variances (VG) for the same suite of traits in a worldwide collection C. elegans. Two robust conclusions emerge. First, the mutational process is highly repeatable: the correlation between VM in two independent sets of mutation accumulation lines is ~0.9. Second, VM for a trait is a very good predictor of VG for that trait: the correlation between VM and VG is ~0.9. This result is predicted for a population at mutation-selection balance; it is not predicted if balancing selection plays a primary role in maintaining genetic variation. Goodness- of-fit of the data to two simple models of mutation suggest that differences in mutational effects may be a more important cause of differences in VM between traits than differences in the size of the mutational target.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Bisulfite sequencing is the gold standard method for analyzing methylomes. However, the effect of quality control in bisulfite sequencing has not been studied extensively. We developed a package ME-Plot to detect the errors in bisulfite sequencing mapping data and produce higher quality methylation calls by trimming low quality portions of the reads. Our simulation results on both randomly generated reads where methylation status is known and real world data indicate that ME-plot can detect errors in methylation mapping procedures and suggest post-processing steps to reduce the errors. ME-Plot requires SAM/BAM files for its analysis. Availability: The python package is available at the following URL. https://github.com/joshuabhk/methylsuite",
