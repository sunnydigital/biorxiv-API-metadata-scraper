    "abstract": "Molecular simulations intended to compute equilibrium properties are often initiated from configurations that are highly atypical of equilibrium samples, a practice which can generate a distinct initial transient in mechanical observables computed from the simulation trajectory. Traditional practice in simulation data analysis recommends this initial portion be discarded to equilibration, but no simple, general, and automated procedure for this process exists. Here, we suggest a conceptually simple automated procedure that does not make strict assumptions about the distribution of the observable of interest, in which the equilibration time is chosen to maximize the number of effectively uncorrelated samples in the production timespan used to compute equilibrium averages. We present a simple Python reference implementation of this procedure, and demonstrate its utility on typical molecular simulation data.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriorhodopsin, a light activated protein that creates a proton gradient in halobacteria, has long served as a simple model of proton pumps. Within bacteriorhodopsin, several key sites undergo protonation changes during the photocycle, moving protons from the higher pH cytoplasm to the lower pH extracellular side. The mechanism underlying the long-range proton translocation between the central (the retinal Schiff base SB216, D85 and D212) and exit clusters (E194 and E204) remains elusive. To obtain a dynamic view of the key factors controlling proton translocation, a systematic study using molecular dynamics simulation was performed for eight bacteriorhodopsin models varying in retinal isomer and protonation of the SB216, D85, D212 and E204. The side-chain orientation of R82 is determined primarily by the protonation states of the residues in the EC. The side-chain reorientation of R82 modulates the hydrogen-bond network and consequently possible pathways of proton transfer. Quantum mechanical intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations of proton-transfer in the methyl guanidinium-hydronium-hydroxide model system show that proton transfer via a guanidinium group requires an initial geometry permitting proton donation and acceptance by the same amine. In all the models, R82 can form proton wires with both the CC and the EC connected by the same amine. Alternatively, rare proton wires for proton transfer from the CC to the EC without involving R82 were found in an O state where the proton on D85 is transferred to D212.",

    "abstract": "Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is emerging as a powerful monitoring tool in cancer, pregnancy and organ transplantation. Nucleosomal DNA, the predominant form of cfDNA in blood, can be readily adapted for sequencing via ligation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) adapters. dsDNA library preparation, however, is insensitive to ultrashort, degraded and single-stranded cfDNA. Drawing inspiration from recent technical advances in ancient genome analyses, we have applied a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) library preparation method to sequencing of cfDNA in the plasma of lung transplant recipients (40 samples, six patients). We found that the ssDNA library preparation yields a greater portion of sub-100 bp DNA, as well as an increased relative abundance of human mitochondrial cfDNA (10.7x) and microbial cfDNA (71.3x). We report the fragmentation pattern of mitochondrial, nuclear genomic and microbial cfDNA over a broad fragment length range. We furthermore report the first observation of donor-specific mitochondrial cfDNA in the circulation of lung transplant recipients. We found that donor-specific mitochondrial cfDNA molecules are significantly shorter than those specific to the recipient. The higher yield of viral, microbial and fungal sequences that result from the single-stranded ligation approach reduces the cost and increase the sensitivity of cfDNA-based monitoring for infectious complications after transplantation. An ssDNA library preparation method provides a more informative window into understudied forms of cfDNA, including mitochondrial and microbial derived cfDNA and short fragment nuclear genomic cfDNA, while retaining information provided by standard dsDNA library preparation methods.",

    "abstract": "Background: Modern clinical trials in stroke reperfusion fall into two categories: alternative systemic pharmacological regimens to alteplase and \\\"rescue\\\" endovascular approaches using targeted thrombectomy devices and/or medications delivered directly for persistently vessel occlusions. Clinical trials in stroke have not evaluated how initial pharmacological thrombolytic management might influence subsequent rescue strategy. A sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is a novel trial design that can test these dynamic treatment regimens and lead to treatment guidelines which more closely mimic practice.\\n\\nAim: To characterize a SMART design in comparison to traditional approaches for stroke reperfusion trials.\\n\\nMethods: We conducted a numerical simulation study that evaluated the performance of contrasting acute stroke clinical trial designs of both initial reperfusion and rescue therapy. We compare a SMART design where the same patients are followed through initial reperfusion and rescue therapy within one trial to a standard phase III design comparing two reperfusion treatments and a separate phase II futility design of rescue therapy in terms of sample size, power, and ability to address particular research questions.\\n\\nResults: Traditional trial designs can be well powered and have optimal design characteristics for independent treatment effects. When treatments, such as the reperfusion and rescue therapies, may interact, commonly used designs fail to detect this. A SMART design, with similar sample size to standard designs, can detect treatment interactions.\\n\\nConclusions: The use of SMART designs to investigate effective and realistic dynamic treatment regimens is a promising way to accelerate the discovery of new, effective treatments for stroke.",

    "abstract": "Modern scientific studies from many diverse areas of research abound with multiple hypothesis testing concerns. The false discovery rate is one of the most commonly used error rates for measuring and controlling rates of false discoveries when performing multiple tests. Adaptive false discovery rates rely on an estimate of the proportion of null hypotheses among all the hypotheses being tested. This proportion is typically estimated once for each collection of hypotheses. Here we propose a regression framework to estimate the proportion of null hypotheses conditional on observed covariates. This may then be used as a multiplication factor with the Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values, leading to a plug-in false discovery rate estimator. Our case study concerns a genome-wise association meta-analysis which considers associations with body mass index. In our framework, we are able to use the sample sizes for the individual genomic loci and the minor allele frequencies as covariates. We further evaluate our approach via a number of simulation scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing transcriptomes in both model and non-model organisms has resulted in a massive increase in our understanding of biological phenomena. This boon, largely made possible via high-throughput sequencing, means that studies of functional, evolutionary and population genomics are now being done by hundreds or even thousands of labs around the world. For many, these studies begin with a de novo transcriptome assembly, which is a technically complicated process involving several discrete steps. Each step may be accomplished in one of several different ways, using different software packages, each producing different results. This analytical complexity begs the question - Which method(s) are optimal? Using reference and non-reference based evaluative methods, I propose a set of guidelines that aim to standardize and facilitate the process of transcriptome assembly. These recommendations include the generation of between 20 million and 40 million sequencing reads from single individual where possible, error correction of reads, gentle quality trimming, assembly filtering using Transrate and/or gene expression, annotation using dammit, and appropriate reporting. These recommendations have been extensively benchmarked and applied to publicly available transcriptomes, resulting in improvements in both content and contiguity. To facilitate the implementation of the proposed standardized methods, I have released a set of version controlled open-sourced code, The Oyster River Protocol for Transcriptome Assembly, available at http://oyster-river-protocol.rtfd.org/.",

    "abstract": "Genomic variation across cancers scales with tissue stiffness: meta-analyses show tumors in stiff tissues such as lung and bone exhibit up to 100-fold more variation than tumors in soft tissues such as marrow and brain. Here, nuclear lamina damage and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) result from invasive migration of cancer cells through stiff constrictions. DSBs increase with lamin-A knockdown and require micro-pores sufficiently small for lamins to impede migration. Blebs in the vast majority of post-migration nuclei are enriched in lamin-A but deficient in lamin-B and an age-associated form of lamin-A. Validation of DSBs by an electrophoretic comet assay calibrates against a cancer line having nuclease sites engineered in chromosome-1, and DSB-bound repair factors in nuclei pulled into constrictions show folded chromatin orients, extends, and concentrates without fragmentation. Mobile repair proteins simultaneously segregate away from pore-condensed chromatin. Global squeeze-out of repair factors and loss with lamin-A-dependent rupture explains why overexpression of repair factors cannot rescue DSBs in migration through stiff constrictions, ultimately favoring genomic variation.",

    "abstract": "No two ovaries are alike, and indeed, the same ovary can change its architecture from day to day. This is because ovarian follicles are present in different numbers, positions, and states of maturation throughout reproductive life. All possible developmental states of follicles can be represented at any time, along with follicles that have committed to death (termed follicle atresia). Static histological and whole-mount imaging approaches allow snapshots of what is occurring within ovaries, but our views of dynamic follicle growth and death have been limited to these tools. We present a simple Markov chain model of the complex mouse ovary, called \\\"[O]vSim\\\". In the model, follicles can exist in one of three Markov states with stationary probabilities, Hold (growth arrest), Grow, and Die. The probability that individual primordial follicles can growth activate daily, the fraction of granulosa cells that survive as follicles grow, and the probability that individual follicles can commit to atresia daily are user definable parameters. When the probability of daily growth activation is stationary at 0.005, the probability of atresia for all follicles is near 0.1, and the probability of granulosa cell survival is modeled around 0.88, [O]vSim simulates the growth and fate of each of the approximately 3000 postpubertal mouse ovarian follicles in a fashion that approximates actual biological measurements (e.g., follicle counts). [O]vSim thus offers a starting platform to simulate mammalian ovaries and to explore factors that might impact follicle development and global organ function.\\n\\nAuthor Summary[O]vSim is a computer simulation of the dynamic growth of mouse ovarian follicles. The program is offered as the beginning of a research and teaching platform to model asynchronous follicle growth and survival or death.",
