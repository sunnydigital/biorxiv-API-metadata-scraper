    "abstract": "Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are powerful tools for genome engineering. These synthetic nucleases are assembled with programmable, sequence-specific DNA-binding domain and a non-specific FokI cleavage domain. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene polymorphism is associated with cardiovascular outcomes, including ischaemic stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD). So the objective of this study is to create mutations of AopE gene by ZFNs and TALENs technology. Here, we used the Context-dependent assembly (CoDA) method to design and screen ZFNs specifically targeting with ApoE gene. The targeted cleavage capacity of these ZFNs was validated in yeast system and HEK 293T cells. Meanwhile, an efficient assembled TALENs to target ApoE gene in HEK 293T cells was as a control. The results showed that both ZFNs and TALENs worked on ApoE gene with similar high-efficiency cleavage capability. The result would provide efficient methods for genome editing, so as to get disease model for gene therapy for the further study.",

    "abstract": "We present three linkage-disequilibrium (LD)-based recombination maps generated using whole-genome sequencing data of 10 Nigerian chimpanzees, 13 bonobos, and 15 western gorillas, collected as part of the Great Ape Genome Project (Prado-Martinez et al. 2013). Using species-specific PRDM9 sequences to predict potential binding sites, we identified an important role for PRDM9 in predicting recombination rate variation broadly across great apes. Our results are contrary to previous research that PRDM9 is not associated with recombination in western chimpanzees (Auton et al. 2012). Additionally, we show that fewer hotspots are shared among chimpanzee subspecies than within human populations, further narrowing the time-scale of complete hotspot turnover. We quantified the variation in the biased distribution of recombination rates towards recombination hotspots across great apes. We found that correlations between broad-scale recombination rates decline more rapidly than nucleotide divergence between species. We also compared the skew of recombination rates at centromeres and telomeres between species and show a skew from chromosome means extending as far as 10-15 Mb from chromosome ends. Further, we examined broad-scale recombination rate changes near a translocation in gorillas and found minimal differences as compared to other great ape species perhaps because the coordinates relative to the chromosome ends were unaffected. Finally, based on multiple linear regression analysis, we found that various correlates of recombination rate persist throughout primates including repeats, diversity, divergence and local effective population size (Ne). Our study is the first to analyze within-and between-species genome-wide recombination rate variation in several close relatives.",

    "abstract": "The P-element is one of the best understood eukaryotic transposable elements. It invaded Drosophila melanogaster populations within a few decades, but was thought to be absent from close relatives, including D. simulans. Five decades after the spread in D. melanogaster, we provide evidence that the P-element has also invaded D. simulans. P-elements in D. simulans appears to have been acquired recently from D. melanogaster probably via a single horizontal transfer event. Expression data indicate that the P-element is processed in the germline of D. simulans, and genomic data show an enrichment of P-element insertions in putative origins of replication, similar to that seen in D. melanogaster. This ongoing spread of the P-element in natural populations provides an unique opportunity to understand the dynamics of transposable element spreads and the associated piRNA defense mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Aerobic exercise capacity can influence many complex traits including obesity and type 2 diabetes. We established two rat lines by divergent selection of intrinsic aerobic capacity. The high capacity runners (HCR) and low capacity runners (LCR) differed by ~9-fold in aerobic capacity after 32 generations, and diverged in body fat, blood glucose, and other health indicators. To study the interplay among genetic differentiation, age, and strenuous exercise, we performed microarray-based gene expression analyses in skeletal muscle with a 2x2x2 design to compare HCR and LCR, old and young animals, and between rest and exhaustion, for a total of eight groups (n=6 each). Transcripts for mitochondrial function are expressed higher in HCR than LCR at both rest and exhaustion, for both age groups. Extracellular matrix components decrease with age in both lines and both rest and exhaustion. Interestingly, age-effects in many pathways are more pronounced in LCR, suggesting that HCRs higher innate aerobic capacity underlies both increased lifespan and heathspan.",
