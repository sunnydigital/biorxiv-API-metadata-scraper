    "abstract": "The well-known Waddingtons epigenetic landscape of cell-fate determination is not static but varies because of the dynamic gene regulation during development. However, existing mathematical models with few state variables and fixed parameters are inadequate in characterizing the temporal transformation of the landscape. Here we simulate a decision-switch model of gene regulation with more than two state variables and with time-varying repression among regulatory factors. We are able to demonstrate multi-lineage differentiation at different timescales that portrays the branching canals in Waddingtons illustration. We also present a repressilator-type system that activates suppressed genes via sustained oscillations in a flattened landscape, hence providing an alternative scheme for cellular reprogramming. The time-dependent parameters governed by gradient-based dynamics regulate cell differentiation, dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation. Our prediction integrates the theories of branching and structural oscillations in cell-fate determination, which reveals key temporal patterns of cell differentiation and associated diseases, such as cancer.",

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data has been the subject of intense research activity over the past many decades. A variety of models and methods have been developed to address different aspects of this important problem. However, these techniques are often difficult to scale, are narrowly focused on particular biological and experimental platforms, and require experimental data that are typically unavailable and difficult to ascertain. The more recent availability of higher-throughput sequencing platforms, combined with more precise modes of genetic perturbation, presents an opportunity to formulate more robust and comprehensive approaches to gene network inference. Here, we propose a step-wise framework for identifying gene-gene regulatory interactions that expand from a known point of genetic or chemical perturbation using time series gene expression data. This novel approach sequentially identifies non-steady state genes post-perturbation and incorporates them into a growing series of low-complexity optimization problems. The governing ordinary differential equations of this model are rooted in the biophysics of stochastic molecular events that underlie gene regulation, delineating roles for both protein and RNA-mediated gene regulation. We show the successful application of our core algorithms for network inference using simulated and real datasets.",

    "abstract": "An enduring challenge in ecology is to understand how diverse plant species coexist when competing for the same basic resources1-4. Two candidate frameworks for meeting this challenge currently exist in forest ecology. Niche-based approaches succeed in describing successional dynamics in response to recurrent disturbances5-9. Approaches based on Hubbells neutral theory describe abundance patterns in highly diverse communities10. Yet both theories are unsuccessful where their competitor is strong, highlighting an enduring need for reconciliation11-13. In fact, the perception that niche and neutral processes are incompatible may have arisen because both types of models have lacked some critical features of real forests. Here we report a productive reconciliation that arises from extending niche models to include three ubiquitous features of vegetation: (1) plant growth under light competition, (2) multiple trait-mediated tradeoffs in plant function, and (3) evolutionary community assembly. We show that fitness equivalence - which neutral theory controversially takes as an assumption4,1213-14 - naturally arises as a mechanistic outcome of niche differentiation, but only within a specific region of trait space, corresponding to shade-tolerant later-successional strategies. In this way, niche diversification can lead, via evolved neutrality, to a proliferation of shade-tolerant strategies, one of the phenomena that motivated the development of neutral theory12. Earlier niche models focussed on a single growth-mortality trait and found no evolved neutrality. In contrast, the model introduced here includes a second trait, height at maturation, in addition to a growth-mortality trait in the form of leaf-construction cost. We show that fitness equivalence only emerges when diversifications include this second trait. We also demonstrate that our extended niche model generates markedly different forest types under different environmental conditions, recovering known biogeographic patterns15-18. By evolving forests from first principles, our study constructively resolves the protracted debate about niche versus neutral dynamics for forest communities, and provides a platform for a synthetic theory of forest structure and diversity.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPWe present an exon-capture system for an entire class of marine invertebrates, the Ophiuroidea, built upon a phylogenetically diverse transcriptome foundation. The system captures ~90 percent of the 1552 exon target, across all major lineages of the quarter-billion year old extant crown group. Key features of our system are: 1) basing the target on an alignment of orthologous genes determined from 52 transcriptomes spanning the phylogenetic diversity and trimmed to remove anything difficult to capture, map or align, 2) use of multiple artificial representatives based on ancestral states rather than exemplars to improve capture and mapping of the target, 3) mapping reads to a multi-reference alignment, and 4) using patterns of site polymorphism to distinguish among paralogy, polyploidy, allelic differences and sample contamination. The resulting data gives a well-resolved tree (currently standing at 417 samples, 275,352 bp, 91% data-complete) that will transform our understanding of ophiuroid evolution and biogeography.",
