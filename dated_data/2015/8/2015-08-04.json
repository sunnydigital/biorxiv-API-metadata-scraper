    "abstract": "Genetic data often exhibit patterns that are broadly consistent with \\\"isolation by distance\\\" - a phenomenon where genetic similarity tends to decay with geographic distance. In a heterogeneous habitat, decay may occur more quickly in some regions than others: for example, barriers to gene flow can accelerate the genetic differentiation between groups located close in space. We use the concept of \\\"effective migration\\\" to model the relationship between genetics and geography: in this paradigm, effective migration is low in regions where genetic similarity decays quickly. We present a method to quantify and visualize variation in effective migration across the habitat, which can be used to identify potential barriers to gene flow, from geographically indexed large-scale genetic data. Our approach uses a population genetic model to relate underlying migration rates to expected pairwise genetic dissimilarities, and estimates migration rates by matching these expectations to the observed dissimilarities. We illustrate the potential and limitations of our method using simulations and geo-referenced genetic data from elephant, human and Arabidopsis thaliana populations. The resulting visualizations highlight important features of the spatial population structure that are difficult to discern using existing methods for summarizing genetic variation such as principal components analysis.",

    "abstract": "Changes in gene expression are thought to regulate the differentiation process intrinsically through complex epigenetic mechanisms. In fundamental terms, however, this assumed regulation refers only to the intricate propagation of changes in gene expression or else leads to logical inconsistencies. The evolution and self-regulatory dynamics of individuated multicellularity also lack a unified and falsifiable description. To fill this gap, I computationally analyzed publicly available high-throughput data of histone H3 post-translational modifications and mRNA abundance for different Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Drosophila melanogaster cell-type/developmental-periods samples. My analysis of genomic regions adjacent to transcription start sites generated a profile from pairwise partial correlations between histone modifications controlling for the respective mRNA levels for each cell-type/developmental-period dataset. I found that these profiles, while explicitly uncorrelated to transcript abundance by construction, associate strongly with cell differentiation states. This association is not expected if cell differentiation is, in effect, regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Based on these results, I propose a falsifiable theory of individuated multicellularity, which relies on the synergistic coupling across the extracellular space of two stochastically independent \\\"self-organizing\\\" systems constraining histone modification states at the same sites. This theory describes how the multicellular individual--understood as an intrinsic, higher-order constraint--emerges from proliferating undifferentiated cells, and may explain the intrinsic regulation of gene transcriptional changes during cell differentiation and the evolution of individuated multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "The social hymenoptera are emerging as models for epigenetics. DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group, is a common epigenetic marker. In mammals and flowering plants methylation affects allele specific expression. There is contradictory evidence for the role of methylation on allele specific expression in social insects. The aim of this paper is to investigate allele specific expression and monoallelic methylation in the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. We found nineteen genes that were both monoallelically methylated and monoallelically expressed in a single bee. Fourteen of these genes express the hypermethylated allele, while the other five express the hypomethylated allele. We also searched for allele specific expression in twenty-nine published RNA-seq libraries. We found 555 loci with allele-specific expression. We discuss our results with reference to the functional role of methylation in gene expression in insects and in the, as yet unquantified, role of genetic cis effects in insect allele specific methylation and expression.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInsertions and deletions (indels) account for more nucleotide differences between two related DNA sequences than substitutions do, and thus it is imperative to develop a stochastic evolutionary model that enables us to reliably calculate the probability of the sequence evolution through indel processes. Recently, such probabilistic models are mostly based on either hidden Markov models (HMMs) or transducer theories, both of which give the indel component of the probability of a given sequence alignment as a product of either probabilities of column-to-column transitions or block-wise contributions along the alignment. However, it is not a priori clear how these models are related with any genuine stochastic evolutionary model, which describes the stochastic evolution of an entire sequence along the time-axis. Moreover, none of these models can fully accommodate biologically realistic features, such as overlapping indels, power-law indel-length distributions, and indel rate variation across regions.\\n\\nResultsHere, we theoretically tackle the ab initio calculation of the probability of a given sequence alignment under a genuine evolutionary model, more specifically, a general continuous-time Markov model of the evolution of an entire sequence via insertions and deletions. Our model allows general indel rate parameters including length distributions but does not impose any unrealistic restrictions on indels. Using techniques of the perturbation theory in physics, we expand the probability into a series over different numbers of indels. Our derivation of this perturbation expansion elegantly bridges the gap between Gillespies (1977) intuitive derivation of his own stochastic simulation method, which is now widely used in evolutionary simulators, and Fellers (1940) mathematically rigorous theorems that underpin Gillespie's method. We find a sufficient and nearly necessary set of conditions under which the probability can be expressed as the product of an overall factor and the contributions from regions separated by gapless columns of the alignment. The indel models satisfying these conditions include those with some kind of rate variation across regions, as well as space-homogeneous models. We also prove that, though with a caveat, pairwise probabilities calculated by the method of Miklos et al. (2004) are equivalent to those calculated by our ab initio formulation, at least under a space-homogenous model.\\n\\nConclusionsOur ab initio perturbative formulation provides a firm theoretical ground that other indel models can rest on.\\n\\n[This paper and three other papers (Ezawa, Graur and Landan 2015a,b,c) describe a series of our efforts to develop, apply, and extend the ab initio perturbative formulation of a general continuous-time Markov model of indels.]",

    "abstract": "Insert size distributions from paired read protocols are used for inference in bioinformatic applications such as genome assembly and structural variation detection. However, many of the models that are being used are subject to bias. This bias arises when we assume that all insert sizes within a distribution are equally likely to be observed, when in fact, size matters. These systematic errors exist in popular software even when the assumptions made about data are true. We have previously shown that bias occurs for scaffolders in genome assembly. Here, we generalize the theory and demonstrate that it is applicable in other contexts. We provide examples of bias in state-of the-art software and improve them using our model. One key application of our theory is structural variation detection using read pairs. We show that an incorrect null-hypothesis is commonly used in popular tools and can be corrected using our theory. Furthermore, we approximate the smallest size of indels that are possible to discover given an insert size distribution. Two other applications are inference of insert size distribution on \\emph{de novo} genome assemblies and error correction of genome assemblies using mated reads.

    "abstract": "Introduction: A cells epigenome arises from interactions among regulatory factors -- transcription factors, histone modifications, and other DNA-associated proteins -- co-localized at particular genomic regions. Identifying the network of interactions among regulatory factors, the chromatin network, is of paramount importance in understanding epigenome regulation.\\n\\nMethods: We developed a novel computational approach, ChromNet, to infer the chromatin network from a set of ChIP-seq datasets. ChromNet has four key features that enable its use on large collections of ChIP-seq data. First, rather than using pairwise co-localization of factors along the genome, ChromNet identifies conditional dependence relationships that better discriminate direct and indirect interactions. Second, our novel statistical technique, the group graphical model, improves inference of conditional dependence on highly correlated datasets. Such datasets are common because some transcription factors form a complex and the same transcription factor is often assayed in different laboratories or cell types. Third, ChromNets computationally efficient method and the group graphical model enable the learning of a joint network across all cell types, which greatly increases the scope of possible interactions. We have shown that this results in a significantly higher fold enrichment for validated protein interactions. Fourth, ChromNet provides an efficient way to identify the genomic context that drives a particular network edge, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of regulatory factor interactions.\\n\\nResults: We applied ChromNet to all available ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE Project, consisting of 1451 ChIP-seq datasets, which revealed previously known physical interactions better than alternative approaches. ChromNet also identified previously unreported regulatory factor interactions. We experimentally validated one of these interactions, between the MYC and HCFC1 transcription factors.\\n\\nDiscussion: ChromNet provides a useful tool for understanding the interactions among regulatory factors and identifying novel interactions. We have provided an interactive web-based visualization of the full ENCODE chromatin network and the ability to incorporate custom datasets at http://chromnet.cs.washington.edu.",

This test was successfully applied to a well-supported homologous sequence alignment, being however criticized once simulations showed that even alignments without any phylogenetic structure could mislead its conclusions [2]. Despite claims to the contrary [3], we believe that the counterexample successfully showed a drawback of the test, of relying on good alignments.\\n\\nHere we present a simplified version of this counterexample, which can be interpreted as a tree with arbitrarily long branches, and where the test again fails. We also present another simulation showing circumstances whereby any sufficiently similar alignment will favor UCA irrespective of the true independent origins for the sequences. We therefore conclude that the test should not be trusted unless convergence has already been ruled out a priori. Finally, we present a class of frequentist tests that perform better than the purportedly formal UCA test.",

We have quantified mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression in WS patient fibroblasts, and in WRN-depleted fibroblasts. Genes down-regulated in WS patient fibroblasts were highly enriched in G-quadruplex (G4) DNA motifs. The strength, location and strand specificity of this association provide strong experimental evidence that G4 motifs or motif-dependent G-quadruplexes are bound by WRN in human cells to modulate gene expression. The expression of many miRNAs was perturbed by loss of WRN function. WRN depletion altered the expression of >500 miRNAs. miRNAs linked to cell signaling, genome stability assurance and tumorigenesis were among the small number of these miRNAs that were persistently altered in WS patient fibroblasts. An unexpected and highly distinct finding in WS cells was the coordinate over-expression of nearly all cytoplasmic tRNA synthetases and their associated AIMP proteins. Our results provide new insight into WS pathogenesis, and identify therapeutically accessible mechanisms that may drive disease pathogenesis in WS and in the general population.",

    "abstract": "Werner syndrome (WS) is a prototypic heritable adult human progeroid syndrome in which signs of premature aging are associated with genetic instability and an elevated risk of specific types of cancer. We have quantified mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression in WS patient fibroblasts, and in WRN-depleted fibroblasts. Genes down-regulated in WS patient fibroblasts were highly enriched in G-quadruplex (G4) DNA motifs. The strength, location and strand specificity of this association provide strong experimental evidence that G4 motifs or motif-dependent G-quadruplexes are bound by WRN in human cells to modulate gene expression. The expression of many miRNAs was perturbed by loss of WRN function. WRN depletion altered the expression of >500 miRNAs. miRNAs linked to cell signaling, genome stability assurance and tumorigenesis were among the small number of these miRNAs that were persistently altered in WS patient fibroblasts. An unexpected and highly distinct finding in WS cells was the coordinate over-expression of nearly all cytoplasmic tRNA synthetases and their associated AIMP proteins. Our results provide new insight into WS pathogenesis, and identify therapeutically accessible mechanisms that may drive disease pathogenesis in WS and in the general population.",
