    "abstract": "Changes in gene expression are thought to regulate the differentiation process intrinsically through complex epigenetic mechanisms. In fundamental terms, however, this assumed regulation refers only to the intricate propagation of changes in gene expression or else leads to logical inconsistencies. The evolution and self-regulatory dynamics of individuated multicellularity also lack a unified and falsifiable description. To fill this gap, I computationally analyzed publicly available high-throughput data of histone H3 post-translational modifications and mRNA abundance for different Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Drosophila melanogaster cell-type/developmental-periods samples. My analysis of genomic regions adjacent to transcription start sites generated a profile from pairwise partial correlations between histone modifications controlling for the respective mRNA levels for each cell-type/developmental-period dataset. I found that these profiles, while explicitly uncorrelated to transcript abundance by construction, associate strongly with cell differentiation states. This association is not expected if cell differentiation is, in effect, regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Based on these results, I propose a falsifiable theory of individuated multicellularity, which relies on the synergistic coupling across the extracellular space of two stochastically independent \\\"self-organizing\\\" systems constraining histone modification states at the same sites. This theory describes how the multicellular individual--understood as an intrinsic, higher-order constraint--emerges from proliferating undifferentiated cells, and may explain the intrinsic regulation of gene transcriptional changes during cell differentiation and the evolution of individuated multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "Organismal size depends on the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses in humans have implied many genes in the control of height but suffer from the inability to control the environment. Genetic analyses in Drosophila have identified conserved signaling pathways controlling size; however, how these pathways control phenotypic diversity is unclear. We performed GWA of size traits using the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel of inbred, sequenced lines. We find that the top associated variants differ between traits and sexes; do not map to canonical growth pathway genes, but can be linked to these by epistasis analysis; and are enriched for genes and putative enhancers. Performing GWA on well-studied developmental traits under controlled conditions expands our understanding of developmental processes underlying phenotypic diversity.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYGenetic studies in Drosophila have elucidated conserved signaling pathways and environmental factors that together control organismal size. In humans, hundreds of genes are associated with height variation, but these associations have not been performed in a controlled environment. As a result we are still lacking an understanding of the mechanisms creating size variability within a species. Here, under carefully controlled environmental conditions, we identify naturally occurring genetic variants that are associated with size diversity in Drosophila. We identify a cluster of associations close to the kek1 locus, a well-characterized growth regulator, but otherwise find that most variants are located in or close to genes that do not belong to the conserved pathways but may interact with these in a biological network. Many of these genes have a conserved role in humans. We validate 33 novel growth regulatory genes that participate in diverse cellular processes, most notably cellular metabolism and cell polarity. This study is the first genome-wide association analysis of natural variants underlying size in Drosophila and our results complement the knowledge we have accumulated on this trait from mutational studies of single genes.",

Consequently, no information is gained from analyzing multiple samples together, and it is difficult to reproduce the exact analysis without access to original computing resources.

For many samples, Rail-RNA is more accurate than annotation-assisted aligners. We use Rail-RNA to align 667 RNA-seq samples from the GEUVADIS project on Amazon Web Services in under 16 hours for US$0.91 per sample. Rail-RNA produces alignments and base-resolution bigWig coverage files, ready for use with downstream packages for reproducible statistical analysis. We identify expressed regions in the GEUVADIS samples and show that both annotated and unannotated (novel) expressed regions exhibit consistent patterns of variation across populations and with respect to known confounders.

    "abstract": "Primary sensory neurons form the interface between world and brain. Their function is well-understood during passive stimulation but, under natural behaving conditions, sense organs are under active, motor control. In an attempt to predict primary neuron firing under natural conditions of sensorimotor integration, we recorded from primary mechanosensory neuronsof awake, head-fixed mice as they explored a pole with their whiskers, and simultaneously measured both whisker motion and forces with high-speed videography. Using Generalised Linear Models, we found that primary neuron responses were poorly predicted by kinematics but well-predicted by rotational forces acting on the whisker: both during touch and free-air whisker motion. These results are discrepant with previous studies of passive stimulation, but could be reconciled by differences in the kinematics-force relationship between active and passive conditions. Thus, simple statistical models can predict rich neural activity elicited by natural, exploratory behaviour involving active movement of the sense organs.",

    "abstract": "One of the unaddressed challenges in drug discovery is that drug potency determined in vitro is not a reliable indicator of drug activity in humans. Accumulated evidences suggest that in vivo activity is more strongly correlated with the binding/unbinding kinetics than the equilibrium thermodynamics of protein-ligand interactions (PLI). However, existing experimental and computational techniques are insufficient in studying the molecular details of kinetics process of PLI. Consequently, we not only have limited mechanistic understanding of the kinetic process but also lack a practical platform for the high-throughput screening and optimization of drug leads based on their kinetic properties. Here we address this unmet need by integrating energetic and conformational dynamic features derived from molecular modeling with multi-task learning. To test our method, HIV-1 protease is used as a model system. Our integrated model provides us with new insights into the molecular determinants of kinetics of PLI. We find that the coherent coupling of conformational dynamics between protein and ligand may play a critical role in determining the kinetic rate constants of PLI. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the relative movement of normal nodes of amino acids upon ligand binding is an important feature to capture conformational dynamics of the binding/unbinding kinetics. Coupled with the multi-task learning, we can predict combined kon and koff accurately with an accuracy of 74.35%. Thus, it is possible to screen and optimize compounds based on their binding/unbinding kinetics. The further development of such computational tools will bridge one of the critical missing links in drug discovery.",

In the classic model organism Drosophila melanogaster and the non-model scuttle fly Megaselia abdita, early activation and placement of gap gene expression domains show significant quantitative differences, yet the final patterning output of the system is essentially identical in both species. In this detailed modeling analysis of system drift, we use gene circuits which are fit to quantitative gap gene expression data in M. abdita and compare them to an equivalent set of models from D. melanogaster. The results of this comparative analysis show precisely how compensatory regulatory mechanisms achieve equivalent final patterns in both species. We discuss the larger implications of the work in terms of \\\"genotype networks\\\" and the ways in which the structure of regulatory networks can influence patterns of evolutionary change (evolvability).",

    "abstract": "The first introns in eukaryotes are much longer than downstream introns. While the functional roles of large first introns have been studied extensively, investigations into the mechanisms leading up to extreme lengths are limited. Prominently, Hong et al. noted that the first introns are predominantly in 5 UTR and suggested that its lengthening may have resulted from a 5-ward shifting of donor site due to a lower selection on splice site, as well as a selection to occlude upstream cryptic translation start sites. Here we suggest exon skipping as an alternative mechanism for first intron lengthening. Exon skipping results in consecutive introns becoming part of a single longer intron. We reasoned that a 5-biased exon skipping rate could lead to longer introns toward the 5-end of the gene, especially the first intron. Based on multiple datasets in human and mouse, we indeed found that internal exons toward the 5-end of the gene are skipped significantly more frequently than the downstream exons. Importantly, we show that 5-biased exon skipping is supported by consistent 5-bias in several genomic, epigenomic, contextual, and evolutionary features that can be functionally linked to exon skipping. Interestingly, we found that first introns are enriched for relics of, now defunct, exons, some of which may have been recruited for regulatory functions; a significantly greater-than-expected fraction of such exons are included in cDNAs in other mammals. Overall, our results offer 5-biased exon skipping as a novel, and arguably more potent, alternative explanation for substantially lengthening of first introns.",

Comparative analysis of the mitochondrial genome and high-copy number genes from 6 additional Balamuthia mandrillaris strains demonstrated remarkable sequence variation, with the closest homologs corresponding to other amoebae, hydroids, algae, slime molds, and peat moss.

Retrospective analysis of a day 1 CSF sample revealed that more timely identification of Balamuthia by metagenomic NGS, potentially resulting in a better outcome, would have required availability of the complete genome sequence.

To address these concerns, a refinement based on the fuzzified Fisher exact test, Fuzzy-FishNet was developed. Fuzzy-FishNet is highly precise (providing probability values that allows exact ranking of features). Furthermore, feature ranks are stable, even in small sample size scenario. Comparison of features selected by genomics and proteomics data respectively revealed that in spite of relative feature stability, cross-platform overlaps are extremely limited, suggesting that networks may not be the answer towards bridging the proteomics-genomics divide.",

Especially in a sparsely connected network, wiring plasticity achieves reliable computation by enabling efficient information transmission.

    "abstract": "To predict in vivo occupancy of a transcription factor (TF), current models consider only the immediate genomic context of a putative binding site (BS) - impact of the sites spatial chromatin context is not known. Using clusters of spatially proximal enhancers, or archipelagos, and DNase footprints to quantify TF occupancy, we report for the first time an emergent group-level effect on occupancy, whereby BS within an archipelago experience greater in vivo occupancy than comparable BS outside archipelagos, i.e. BS not in spatial proximity with other homotypic BS. This occupancy boost is tissue-specific and scales robustly with the total number of BS, or enhancers, for the TF in the archipelago. Interestingly, enhancers within an archipelago are non-uniformly impacted by the occupancy boost; specifically, archipelago enhancers that are enriched for BS corresponding to degenerate motifs exhibit the greatest occupancy boost, as well as the highest overall accessibility, evolutionary selection, and expression at neighboring gene loci. Strikingly, archipelago-wide activity scales with expression of TFs with degenerate, but not specific, motifs. We explain these results through biophysical modelling, which suggests that spatially proximal homotypic BS facilitate TF diffusion, and induce boosts in local TF concentration and occupancy. Together, we demonstrate for the first time cooperativity among genomically distal homotypic BS that is contingent upon their spatial proximity, consistent with a TF diffusion model. Through leveraging of three-dimensional chromatin structure and TF availability, weak archipelago binding sites crowdsource their occupancy as well as context specificity, with coordinated switch-like effect on overall archipelago activity.",

Having previously investigated temperatures impact on embryogenesis, we characterized developmental response to oxygen levels using time-lapse imaging. Changing oxygen concentrations greatly impact survival, with developmental rate changes that are dwarfed by those induced by temperature. While extreme temperatures increase early embryo mortality, mild hypoxia increases arrest and death during mid-embryogenesis and mild hyperoxia increases survival over normoxia. Though not independent, the reactions to temperature and oxygen are fundamentally different, with developmental time being inversely proportional to oxygen concentration but logarithmically related to temperature. Most notably, while development scales uniformly with temperature, oxygen changes drive developmental heterochrony. Morphological processes change with oxygen concentration at different rates. Gut formation is more severely slowed by decreases in oxygen, while head involution and syncytial development are less impacted than the rest of development. These data reveal that uniform scaling, seen with changes in temperature, is not the default result of adjusting developmental rate.",
