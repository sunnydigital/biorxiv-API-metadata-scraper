    "abstract": "Changes in gene expression are thought to regulate the differentiation process intrinsically through complex epigenetic mechanisms. In fundamental terms, however, this assumed regulation refers only to the intricate propagation of changes in gene expression or else leads to logical inconsistencies. The evolution and self-regulatory dynamics of individuated multicellularity also lack a unified and falsifiable description. To fill this gap, I computationally analyzed publicly available high-throughput data of histone H3 post-translational modifications and mRNA abundance for different Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Drosophila melanogaster cell-type/developmental-periods samples. My analysis of genomic regions adjacent to transcription start sites generated a profile from pairwise partial correlations between histone modifications controlling for the respective mRNA levels for each cell-type/developmental-period dataset. I found that these profiles, while explicitly uncorrelated to transcript abundance by construction, associate strongly with cell differentiation states. This association is not expected if cell differentiation is, in effect, regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Based on these results, I propose a falsifiable theory of individuated multicellularity, which relies on the synergistic coupling across the extracellular space of two stochastically independent \\\"self-organizing\\\" systems constraining histone modification states at the same sites. This theory describes how the multicellular individual--understood as an intrinsic, higher-order constraint--emerges from proliferating undifferentiated cells, and may explain the intrinsic regulation of gene transcriptional changes during cell differentiation and the evolution of individuated multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "AimWe studied different species of gooseneck barnacles from the globally distributed rafting genus Lepas to examine whether the most widespread species are true cosmopolitans and to explore the factors influencing the phylogeny and biogeography of these epipelagic rafters.\\n\\nLocationTemperate and tropical parts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indic oceans.\\n\\nMethodsWe used a phylogenetic approach based on mitochondrial 16S and coI sequences, and the nuclear 18S gene to elucidate patterns of inter- and intra-species divergence. Altogether, five species of Lepas from 18 confined regions of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indic oceans were analyzed.\\n\\nResultsA combination of nuclear and mitochondrial sequences provided robust phylogenetic signals for biogeographic classification of subgroups in Lepas species. Lepas australis, restricted to cold-temperate waters of the southern hemisphere shows two separate populations in the southern hemisphere (coastal Chile, other circum-Antarctic sampling sites) most probably related to temperature differences in the southern Pacific current systems. A more complex differentiation is seen for the cosmopolitan L. anatifera that thrives in warmer waters. In total, it is differentiated in four regional subgroups (coastal Chile, Oregon, Indopacific in general, Atlantic) and a global group, which might be either an ancient stemgroup, but more probably is an anthropogenic artefact. Separation into subgroups likely reflect geological vicariance effects. For Lepas, these were closure of the Isthmus of Panama, installation of the cool Benguela Current in the later Miocene including its persistence into the Present, Pleistocene current systems in the western Pacific differing from today, and in general lowered Pleistocene temperatures, and finally present-day current systems. The extreme ecological generalists L. anserifera and L. pectinata are not differentated according to available data and might represent true global species. Data for L. testudinata remain ambiguous.\\n\\nMain conclusionsOur data indicate cryptic speciation in some but not all species of the cosmopolitan epipelagic genus Lepas. Regional distribution of genetically different populations rely on a wealth of in part interacting inherited geological factors and modern traits. Controlling factors differ between species according to their ecospace limits and demonstrate the need for studies on species level to avoid unjustified generalizations. Data indicate that allopatric speciation is the main mode of divergence. True global species, if existent at all, need to be extreme ecological generalists, like Lepas pectinata and L. anserifera.",

    "abstract": "Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples represent a potentially invaluable resource for transcriptomic-based research into the molecular basis of disease. However, use of FFPE samples in gene expression studies has been limited by technical challenges resulting from degradation of nucleic acids. Here we evaluated gene expression profiles derived from fresh-frozen (FRO) and FFPE mouse liver tissues using two DNA microarray protocols and two whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) library preparation methodologies. The ribo-depletion protocol outperformed the other three methods by having the highest correlations of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and best overlap of pathways between FRO and FFPE groups. We next tested the effect of sample time in formalin (18 hours or 3 weeks) on gene expression profiles. Hierarchical clustering of the datasets indicated that test article treatment, and not preservation method, was the main driver of gene expression profiles. Meta- and pathway analyses indicated that biological responses were generally consistent for 18-hour and 3-week FFPE samples compared to FRO samples. However, clear erosion of signal intensity with time in formalin was evident, and DEG numbers differed by platform and preservation method. Lastly, we investigated the effect of age in FFPE block on genomic profiles. RNA-seq analysis of 8-, 19-, and 26-year-old control blocks using the ribo-depletion protocol resulted in comparable quality metrics, including expected distributions of mapped reads to exonic, UTR, intronic, and ribosomal fractions of the transcriptome. Overall, our results suggest that FFPE samples are appropriate for use in genomic studies in which frozen samples are not available, and that ribo-depletion RNA-seq is the preferred method for this type of analysis in archival and long-aged FFPE samples.\\n\\nAuthor contributions\\n\\nO_TBL View this table:\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@124589eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1361ddeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e30065org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2f0ed5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@176fc83_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL",

    "abstract": "Sex chromosomes evolve distinctive types of chromatin from a pair of ancestral autosomes that are usually euchromatic. In Drosophila, the dosage-compensated X becomes enriched for hyperactive chromatin in males (mediated by H4K16ac), while the Y chromosome acquires silencing heterochromatin (enriched for H3K9me2/3). Drosophila autosomes are typically mostly euchromatic but the small dot chromosome has evolved a heterochromatin-like milieu (enriched for H3K9me2/3) that permits the normal expression of dot-linked genes, but which is different from typical pericentric heterochromatin. In Drosophila busckii, the dot chromosomes have fused to the ancestral sex chromosomes, creating a pair of  neo-sex chromosomes. Here we collect genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic data from D. busckii, to investigate the evolutionary trajectory of sex chromosomes from a largely heterochromatic ancestor. We show that the neo-sex chromosomes formed <1 million years ago, but nearly 60% of neo-Y linked genes have already become non-functional. Expression levels are generally lower for the neo-Y alleles relative to their neo-X homologs, and the silencing heterochromatin mark H3K9me2, but not H3K9me3, is significantly enriched on silenced neo-Y genes. Despite rampant neo-Y degeneration, we find that the neo-X is deficient for the canonical histone modification mark of dosage compensation (H4K16ac), relative to autosomes or the compensated ancestral X chromosome, possibly reflecting constraints imposed on evolving hyperactive chromatin in an originally heterochromatic environment. Yet, neo-X genes are transcriptionally more active in males, relative to females, suggesting the evolution of incipient dosage compensation on the neo-X. Our data show that Y degeneration proceeds quickly after sex chromosomes become established through genomic and epigenetic changes, and are consistent with the idea that the evolution of sex-linked chromatin is influenced by its ancestral configuration.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDNA is packaged with proteins into two general types of chromatin: the transcriptionally active euchromatin and repressive heterochromatin. Sex chromosomes typically evolve from a pair of euchromatic autosomes. The Y chromosome of Drosophila is gene poor and almost entirely heterochromatic; the X chromosome, in contrast, has evolved a hyperactive euchromatin structure and globally up-regulates its gene expression, to compensate for loss of activity from the homologous genes on the Y chromosome. The evolutionary trajectory along which sex chromosomes evolve such opposite types of chromatin configurations remains unclear, as most sex chromosomes are ancient and no longer contain signatures of their transitions. Here we investigate a pair of unusual young sex chromosomes (termed  neo-Y and  neo-X chromosomes) in D. busckii, which formed through fusions of a largely heterochromatic autosome (the  dot chromosome) to the ancestral sex chromosomes. We show that nearly 60% of the neo-Y genes have already become non-functional within only 1 million years of evolution. Gene expression is lower on the neo-Y than on the neo-X, which is associated with a higher level of binding of a silencing heterochromatin mark. The neo-X, on the other hand, shows no evidence of evolving hyperactive chromatin for dosage compensation. Our results show that the Y chromosome can degenerate quickly, but the tempo and mode of chromatin evolution on the sex chromosomes may be constrained by the ancestral chromatin configuration.",

    "abstract": "Role of microRNAs in gene regulation has been well established. Though the number of genes appear to be equal between human and zebrafish, miRNAs detected in zebrafish ([~]247) is significantly low compared to human ([~]2000; miRBase Release 19). It appears that most of the miRNAs in zebrafish are yet to be discovered. Using next generation sequencing technology, we sequenced small RNAs from brain, gut, liver, ovary, testis, eye, heart and embryo of zebrafish. In few tissues (brain, gut, liver) sequencing was done sex specifically. About 16-62% of the sequenced reads mapped to known miRNAs of zebrafish, with the exceptions of ovary (5.7%) and testis (7.8%). We used miRDeep2, the miRNA predication tool, to discover the novel miRNAs using the un-annotated reads that ranged from 7.6 to 23.0%, with exceptions of ovary (51.4%) and testis (55.2%) that had the largest pool of un-annotated reads. The prediction tool identified a total of 459 novel pre-miRNAs. Comparison of miRNA expression data of the tissues showed the presence of tissue and sex specific miRNAs that could serve as biomarkers. The brain and liver had highest number of tissue specific (36) and sex specific (34) miRNAs, respectively. Taken together, we have made a comprehensive approach to identify tissue and sex specific miRNAs from zebrafish. Further, we have discovered 459 novel pre-miRNAs ([~]30% homology to human miRNA) as additional genomic resource for zebrafish. This resource can facilitate further investigations to understand miRNA-mRNA gene regulatory network in zebrafish which will have implications to understand human miRNA function.",

    "abstract": "Species delimitation is problematic in many taxa due to the difficulty of evaluating predictions from species delimitation hypotheses, which chiefly relay on subjective interpretations of morphological observations and/or DNA sequence data. This problem is exacerbated in recalcitrant taxa for which genetic resources are scarce and inadequate to resolve questions regarding evolutionary relationships and uniqueness. In this case study we demonstrate the empirical utility of restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) by unambiguously resolving phylogenetic relationships among recalcitrant octocoral taxa with divergences greater than 80 million years. We objectively infer robust species boundaries in the genus Paragorgia, which contains some of the most important ecosystem engineers in the deep-sea, by testing alternative taxonomy-guided or unguided species delimitation hypotheses using the Bayes factors delimitation method (BFD*) with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data. We present conclusive evidence rejecting the current morphological species delimitation model for the genus Paragorgia and indicating the presence of cryptic species boundaries associated with environmental variables. We argue that the suitability limits of RAD-seq for phylogenetic inferences in divergent taxa cannot be assessed in terms of absolute time, but depend on taxon-specific factors such as mutation rate, generation time and effective population size. We show that classic morphological taxonomy can greatly benefit from integrative approaches that provide objective tests to species delimitation hypothesis. Our results pave the way for addressing further questions in biogeography, species ranges, community ecology, population dynamics, conservation, and evolution in octocorals and other marine taxa.",

    "abstract": "Artemisinin resistant Plasmodium falciparum is advancing across Southeast Asia in a soft selective sweep involving at least 20 independent kelch13 mutations. In a large global survey, we find that kelch13 mutations which cause resistance in Southeast Asia are present at low frequency in Africa. We show that African kelch13 mutations have originated locally, and that kelch13 shows a normal variation pattern relative to other genes in Africa, whereas in Southeast Asia there is a great excess of non-synonymous mutations, many of which cause radical amino-acid changes. Thus, kelch13 is not currently undergoing strong selection in Africa, despite a deep reservoir of standing variation that could potentially allow resistance to emerge rapidly. The practical implications are that public health surveillance for artemisinin resistance should not rely on kelch13 data alone, and interventions to prevent resistance must account for local evolutionary conditions, shown by genomic epidemiology to differ greatly between geographical regions.",
