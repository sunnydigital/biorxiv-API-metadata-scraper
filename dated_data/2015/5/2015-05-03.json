    "abstract": "Changes in gene expression are thought to regulate the differentiation process intrinsically through complex epigenetic mechanisms. In fundamental terms, however, this assumed regulation refers only to the intricate propagation of changes in gene expression or else leads to logical inconsistencies. The evolution and self-regulatory dynamics of individuated multicellularity also lack a unified and falsifiable description. To fill this gap, I computationally analyzed publicly available high-throughput data of histone H3 post-translational modifications and mRNA abundance for different Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Drosophila melanogaster cell-type/developmental-periods samples. My analysis of genomic regions adjacent to transcription start sites generated a profile from pairwise partial correlations between histone modifications controlling for the respective mRNA levels for each cell-type/developmental-period dataset. I found that these profiles, while explicitly uncorrelated to transcript abundance by construction, associate strongly with cell differentiation states. This association is not expected if cell differentiation is, in effect, regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Based on these results, I propose a falsifiable theory of individuated multicellularity, which relies on the synergistic coupling across the extracellular space of two stochastically independent \\\"self-organizing\\\" systems constraining histone modification states at the same sites. This theory describes how the multicellular individual--understood as an intrinsic, higher-order constraint--emerges from proliferating undifferentiated cells, and may explain the intrinsic regulation of gene transcriptional changes during cell differentiation and the evolution of individuated multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "Limiting dilution assays are commonly used to measure the extent of infection, and in the context of HIV they represent an essential tool for studying latency and potential curative strategies. To assist investigators using dilution assays, we illustrate the major statistical method for estimating the frequency of infected cells (or other infectious units) from assay results, and we offer an online tool for computing this estimate. We then recommend a procedure for optimizing assay design to achieve any desired set of sensitivity and precision goals, subject to experimental constraints. We discuss challenges involved in interpreting experiments in which no viral growth is observed and explain how using alternative measures for viral outgrowth may make measurement of HIV latency more efficient. Finally, we discuss how biological complications - such as probabilistic growth of a small infection in culture - alter interpretations of experimental results.",

Shotgun NGS data analysis revealed high diversity of microbes from Bacteria and Archaea domains. The metabolic potential of the metagenome was reconstructed using the NGS data and the SEED classification in MEGAN shows abundance of virulence factor genes, implying that mangrove soil is potential reservoirs of pathogens.",

    "abstract": "We have identified a strain of C. neteri SSMD04 isolated from pickled mackerel sashimi that produced N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) type quorum sensing (QS) activity. Tandem mass sspectrometry revealed that C. neteri SSMD04 produced N-butyryl-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL). We identified a pair of luxIR homologues in this genome that shares the highest similarity with croIR from Citrobacter rodentium. The AHL synthase, which we named it as cneI (636 bp) and at 8bp distance from cneI is a sequence encoding a hypothetical protein, potentially the cognate receptor, a luxR homologue which we named it as cneR. We also found an orphan luxR in this isolate. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the AHL production activity in C. neteri, discovery of its luxI/R homologues and the orphan receptor.",
