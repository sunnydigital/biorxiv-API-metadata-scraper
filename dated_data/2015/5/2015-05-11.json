    "abstract": "The human and chimpanzee X chromosomes are less divergent than expected based on autosomal divergence. This has led to a controversial hypothesis proposing a unique role of the X chromosome in human-chimpanzee speciation. We study incomplete lineage sorting patterns between humans, chimpanzees and gorillas to show that this low divergence is entirely due to megabase-sized regions comprising one-third of the X chromosome, where polymorphism in the human-chimpanzee ancestral species was severely reduced. Background selection can explain 10% of this reduction at most. Instead, we show that several strong selective sweeps in the ancestral species can explain this reduction of diversity in the ancestor. We also report evidence of population specific sweeps in extant humans that overlap the regions of low diversity in the ancestral species. These regions further correspond to chromosomal sections shown to be devoid of Neanderthal introgression into modern humans. This suggests that the same X-linked regions that undergo selective sweeps are among the first to form reproductive barriers between diverging species. We hypothesize that meiotic drive is the underlying mechanism causing these two observations.\\n\\nAuthors' SummaryBecause the speciation events that leads to human, chimpanzee and gorilla were close in time, their genetic relationship of these species varies along the genome. While human and chimpanzee species are most closely related, 15% of the human genome is more closely related to the gorilla genome than the chimpanzee genome, a phenomenon called incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). The amount and distribution of ILS can be predicted using population genetics theory, and is affected by demography and selection in the ancestral populations. It was previously reported that the X chromosome, in contrast to autosomes, is deprived of ILS, and this givies rise to controversial theories about the speciation event that splits humans and chimpanzees. Using a full genome alignment of the X chromosome, we show that this deprivation of ILS affects only one third of the chromosome. These regions also show reduced diversity in the extant populations of human and great apes, and coincide with regions devoid of Neanderthal introgression. We propose that these regions are targets of selection and that they played a role in the formation of reproductive barriers.",

    "abstract": "Recent improvements in next-generation sequencing of tumor samples and the ability to identify somatic mutations at low allelic fractions have opened the way for new approaches to model the evolution of individual cancers. The power and utility of these models is increased when tumor samples from multiple sites are sequenced. Temporal ordering of the samples may provide insight into the etiology of both primary and metastatic lesions and rationalizations for tumor recurrence and therapeutic failures. Additional insights may be provided by temporal ordering of evolving subclones - cellular subpopulations with unique mutational profiles. Current methods for subclone hierarchy inference tightly couple the problem of temporal ordering with that of estimating the fraction of cancer cells harboring each mutation. We present a new framework that includes a rigorous statistical hypothesis test and a collection of tools that make it possible to decouple these problems, which we believe will enable substantial progress in the field of subclone hierarchy inference. The methods presented here can be flexibly combined with methods developed by others addressing either of these problems. We provide tools to interpret hypothesis test results, which inform phylogenetic tree construction, and we introduce the first genetic algorithm designed for this purpose. The utility of our framework is systematically demonstrated in simulations. For most tested combinations of tumor purity, sequencing coverage, and tree complexity, good power ([&ge;] 0.8) can be achieved and Type 1 error is well controlled when at least three tumor samples are available from a patient. Using data from three published multi-region tumor sequencing studies of (murine) small cell lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in which the authors reconstructed subclonal phylogenetic trees by manual expert curation, we show how different configurations of our tools can identify either a single tree in agreement with the authors, or a small set of trees, which include the authors preferred tree. Our results have implications for improved modeling of tumor evolution and the importance of multi-region tumor sequencing.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCancer is a genetic disease, driven by DNA mutations. Each tumor is composed of millions of cells with differing genetic profiles that compete with each other for resources in a process similar to Darwinian evolution. We describe a computational framework to model tumor evolution on the cellular level, using next-generation sequencing. The framework is the first to apply a rigorous statistical hypothesis test designed to inform a new search algorithm. Both the test and the algorithm are based on evolutionary principles. The utility of the framework is shown in computer simulations and by automated reconstruction of the cellular evolution underlying murine small cell lung cancers, acute myeloid leukemias and chronic lymophocytic leukemias, from three recent published studies.",

    "abstract": "Imaging cellular activities in an entire intact whole organ with light is a grand challenge in optical microscopy. To date, most passive clearing techniques were shown to transform brain, neuronal and embryo tissue into near transparent state for deep tissue imaging. Here, we expand these passive clearing protocols from neuronal tissue (brain and spinal cord) to other visceral organs such as liver and colon and further evaluate their \\\"depth-clearing performance\\\" based on image contrast of endogenous fluorescence structures. We found that SeeDB achieves the highest depth in brain, 3DISCO is adept at clearing liver and spinal cord and ScaleViewA2 in colon. Overall, 3DISCO clears more rapidly than other agents but at a higher cost, while ScaleViewA2 is the most economical however at a slower rate. This study, for the first time, provide a direct evaluation of imaging depth, cost and time amongst passive tissue clearing protocols for different intact organs. In addition, we discuss the possible roles of tissue composition in clearing.",

    "abstract": "Sophisticated inferential tools coupled with the coalescent model have recently emerged for estimating past population sizes from genomic data. Accurate methods are available for data from a single locus or from independent loci. Recent methods that model recombination require small sample sizes, make constraining assumptions about population size changes, and do not report measures of uncertainty for estimates. Here, we develop a Gaussian process-based Bayesian nonparametric method coupled with a sequentially Markov coalescent model which allows accurate inference of population sizes over time from a set of genealogies. In contrast to current methods, our approach considers a broad class of recombination events, including those that do not change local genealogies. We show that our method outperforms recent likelihood-based methods that rely on discretization of the parameter space. We illustrate the application of our method to multiple demographic histories, including population bottlenecks and exponential growth. In simulation, our Bayesian approach produces point estimates four times more accurate than maximum likelihood estimation (based on the sum of absolute differences between the truth and the estimated values). Further, our methods credible intervals for population size as a function of time cover 90 percent of true values across multiple demographic scenarios, enabling formal hypothesis testing about population size differences over time. Using genealogies estimated with ARGweaver, we apply our method to European and Yoruban samples from the 1000 Genomes Project and confirm key known aspects of population size history over the past 150,000 years.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of developmental disabilities that affect social interaction, communication and are characterized by repetitive behaviors. There is now a large body of evidence that suggests a complex role of genetics in ASD, in which many different loci are involved. Although many current population scale genomic studies have been demonstrably fruitful, these studies generally focus on analyzing a limited part of the genome or use a limited set of bioinformatics tools. These limitations preclude the analysis of genome-wide perturbations that may contribute to the development and severity of ASD-related phenotypes. To overcome these limitations, we have developed and utilized an integrative clinical and bioinformatics pipeline for generating a more complete and reliable set of genomic variants for downstream analyses. Our study focuses on the analysis of three simplex autism families consisting of one affected child, unaffected parents, and one unaffected sibling. All members were clinically evaluated and widely phenotyped. Genotyping arrays and whole genome sequencing were performed on each member, and the resulting sequencing data were analyzed using a variety of available bioinformatics tools. We searched for rare variants of putative functional impact that were found to be segregating according to de-novo, autosomal recessive, x-linked, mitochondrial and compound heterozygote transmission models. The resulting candidate variants included three small heterozygous CNVs, a rare heterozygous de novo nonsense mutation in MYBBP1A located within exon 1, and a novel de novo missense variant in LAMB3. Our work demonstrates how more comprehensive analyses that include rich clinical data and whole genome sequencing data can generate reliable results for use in downstream investigations. We are moving to implement our framework for the analysis and study of larger cohorts of families, where statistical rigor can accompany genetic findings.",

    "abstract": "Memory and learning are thought to result from changes in synaptic strength. Previous studies on synaptic physiology in brain slices have traditionally been focused on biochemical processes. Here, we demonstrate with experiments on mouse brain slices that central nervous system plasticity is also sensitive to mechanical stretch. This is important, given the host of clinical conditions involving changes in mechanical tension on the brain, and the normal role that mechanical tension plays in brain development. A novel platform is developed to investigate neural responses to mechanical stretching. Flavoprotein autofluoresence (FA) imaging was employed for measuring neural activity. We observed that synaptic excitability substantially increases after a small (2.5%) stretch was held for 10 minutes and released. The increase is accumulative, i.e. multiple stretch cycles further increase the excitability. We also developed analytical tools to quantify the spatial spread and response strength. Results show that the spatial spread is less stable in slices undergoing the stretch-unstretch cycle. FA amplitude and activation rate decrease as excitability increases in stretch cases but not in electrically enhanced cases. These results collectively demonstrate that a small stretch in physiological range can modulate neural activities significantly, suggesting that mechanical events can be employed as a novel tool for the modulation of neural plasticity.",

    "abstract": "This report includes the discovery and analysis of a pedigree with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), and dysautonomia-like symptoms. Nine members of the family participated in whole genome sequencing (WGS), which enabled a wide scope of variant calling from single-nucleotide polymorphisms to copy number variations. First, a 5.5 Mb de novo deletion is identified in the chromosome region 15q11.2 to 15q13.1 in the boy with PWS. Second, a female invididual with HH is homozygous for the p.C282Y variant in HFE, a mutation known to be associated with HH. Her brother is homozygous for the same variant, although he has yet to be clinically diagnosed with HH. Third, none of the people with dysautonomia-like symptoms carry any reported or novel rare variants in IKBKAP that are implicated in familial dysautonomia (FD - HSAN III). Although two people with dysautonomia-like symptoms carry two heterozygous variants in NTRK1, a gene that has been shown to contribute to HSAN IV (congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis, a disease that closely resembles FD), this variant is not present in the third proband. Fourth, WGS revealed pharmacogenetic variants influencing the metabolism of warfarin and simvastatin, which are being routinely prescribed to the proband. Finally, reports of the phenotypes were standardized with the Human Phenotype Ontology annotation, which may facilitate the search for other families with similar phenotypes. Due to the extreme heterogeneity and insufficient knowledge of human diseases, it is of crucial importance that both phenotypic data and genomic data are standardized and shared.",

It includes a critical examination of the current dogma that its primary purpose is the generation of hydrogen peroxide as substrate for myeloperoxide catalysed generation of hypochlorite. Instead it is demonstrated that NADPH oxidase functions to optimise the ionic and pH conditions within the vacuole for the solubilisation and optimal activity of the proteins released into this compartment from the cytoplasmic granules, which kill and digest the microbes. The general role of other NOX systems as electrochemical generators to alter the pH and ionic composition in compartments on either side of a membrane in plants and animals will also be examined.",
