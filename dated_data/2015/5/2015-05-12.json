    "abstract": "1 Abstract 1.1 MotivationCircularized Chromosome Conformation Capture (4C) is a powerful technique for studying the spatial interactions of a specific genomic region called the \\\"viewpoint\\\" with the rest of the genome, both in a single condition or comparing different experimental conditions or cell types. Observed ligation frequencies show a strong, regular dependence on genomic distance from the viewpoint, on top of which specific interaction peaks are superimposed. Here, we address the computational task to find these specific interactions and to detect changes between interaction profiles of different conditions.\\n\\n1.2 ResultsWe model the overall trend of decreasing interaction frequency with genomic distance by fitting a smooth monotonously decreasing function to suitably transformed count data. Based on the fit, z-scores are calculated from the residuals, with high z scores being interpreted as peaks providing evidence for specific interactions. To compare different conditions, we normalize fragment counts between samples, and call for differential contact frequencies using the statistical method DESeq2 adapted from RNA-Seq analysis.\\n\\n1.3 Availability and ImplementationA full end-to-end analysis pipeline is implemented in the R package FourCSeq available at www.bioconductor.org.\\n\\n1.4 Contactfelix.klein@embl.de, whuber@embl.de",

    "abstract": "1A powerful way to detect selection in a population is by modeling local allele frequency changes in a particular region of the genome under scenarios of selection and neutrality, and finding which model is most compatible with the data. Chen et al. [2010] developed a composite likelihood method called XPCLR that uses an outgroup population to detect departures from neutrality which could be compatible with hard or soft sweeps, at linked sites near a beneficial allele. However, this method is most sensitive to recent selection and may miss selective events that happened a long time ago. To overcome this, we developed an extension of XP-CLR that jointly models the behavior of a selected allele in a three-population tree. Our method - called 3P-CLR - outperforms XP-CLR when testing for selection that occurred before two populations split from each other, and can distinguish between those events and events that occurred specifically in each of the populations after the split. We applied our new test to population genomic data from the 1000 Genomes Project, to search for selective sweeps that occurred before the split of Yoruba and Eurasians, but after their split from Neanderthals, and that could have led to the spread of modern-human-specific phenotypes. We also searched for sweep events that occurred in East Asians, Europeans and the ancestors of both populations, after their split from Yoruba. In both cases, we are able to confirm a number of regions identified by previous methods, and find several new candidates for selection in recent and ancient times. For some of these, we also find suggestive functional mutations that may have driven the selective events.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulation in biological systems is impacted by the cellular and genetic context-dependent effects of the biological parts which comprise the circuit. Here, we have sought to elucidate the limitations of engineering biology from an architectural point of view, with the aim of compiling a set of engineering solutions for overcoming failure modes during the development of complex, synthetic genetic circuits. Using a synthetic biology approach that is supported by computational modelling and rigorous characterisation, AND, OR and NOT biological logic gates were layered in both parallel and serial arrangements to generate a repertoire of Boolean operations that include NIMPLY, XOR, half adder and half subtractor logics in single cell. Subsequent evaluation of these near-digital biological systems revealed critical design pitfalls that triggered genetic context dependent effects, including 5 UTR interference and uncontrolled switch-on behaviour of {sigma}54 promoter. Importantly, this work provides a representative case study to the debugging of genetic context dependent effects through principles elucidated herein, thereby providing a rational design framework to program single prokaryotic cell with diversified digital operations.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome provides access to otherwise unavailable metabolic and immune functions, likely affecting mammalian fitness and evolution. To investigate how this microbial ecosystem impacts evolutionary adaptation of humans to particular habitats, we explore the gut microbiome and metabolome of the BaAka rainforest hunter-gatherers from Central Africa. The data demonstrate that the BaAka harbor a colonic ecosystem dominated by Prevotellaceae and other taxa likely related to an increased capacity to metabolize plant structural polysaccharides, phenolics, and lipids. A comparative analysis shows that the BaAka gut microbiome shares similar patterns with that of the Hadza, another hunter-gatherer population from Tanzania. Nevertheless, the BaAka harbor significantly higher bacterial diversity and pathogen load compared to the Hadza, as well as other Western populations. We show that the traits unique to the BaAka microbiome and metabolome likely reflect adaptations to hunter-gatherer lifestyles and particular subsistence patterns. We hypothesize that the observed increase in microbial diversity and potential pathogenicity in the BaAka microbiome has been facilitated by evolutionary adaptations in immunity genes, resulting in a more tolerant immune system.\\n\\nSignificanceHuman ecological adaptation requires changes at the genomic level. However, the gut microbiome, the collection of microbes inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract and their functions, also responds significantly to ecological challenge. To determine how the gut microbiome responds to evolutionary adaptations in the host, we profiled gut bacterial communities of the BaAka, rainforest hunter-gatherers from Central Africa. The gut microbiome of the BaAka shows adaptations to metabolize foods rich in fiber, tannins and fats. Similarly, higher bacterial diversity and abundance of pathogenic bacteria, compared to other hunter-gatherers and western populations, suggest that the BaAka immune system evolved to coexist with increased pathogen threats. Accordingly, these results show how the gut microbiome contributes to human ecological plasticity, impacting host adaptation and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Under modern interrogation, famously well-studied neural circuits such as that for orientation tuning in V1 are steadily giving up their secrets, but quite basic questions about connectivity and dynamics, including whether most computation is done by lateral processing or by selective feedforward summation, remain unresolved. We show here that grid cells offer a particularly rich opportunity for dissecting the mechanistic underpinnings of a cortical circuit, through a strategy based on global circuit perturbation combined with sparse neural recordings. The strategy is based on the theoretical insight that small perturbations of circuit activity will result in characteristic quantal shifts in the spatial tuning relationships between grid cells, which should be observable from multisingle unit recordings of a small subsample of the population. The predicted shifts differ qualitatively across candidate recurrent network mechanisms, and also distinguish between recurrent versus feedforward mechanisms. More generally, the proposed strategy demonstrates how sparse neural recordings coupled with global perturbation in the grid cell system can reveal much more about circuit mechanism as it relates to function than can full knowledge of network activity or of the synaptic connectivity matrix.",
