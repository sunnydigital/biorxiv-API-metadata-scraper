    "abstract": "Recently, psychophysical laws have been observed to be functional in certain factors working downstream of the Wnt pathway. This work tests the veracity of the prevalence of such laws, albeit at a coarse level, using sensitivity analysis on biologically inspired epigenetically influenced computational causal models. In this work, the variation in the effect of the predictive behaviour of the transcription complex (TRCMPLX) conditional on the evidences of gene expressions in normal/tumor samples is observed by varying the initially assigned values of conditional probability tables (cpt) for TRCMPLX. Preliminary analysis shows that the variation in predictive behaviour of TRCMPLX follows power-logarithmic psychophysical law, crudely. More recently, wet lab experiments have proved the existence of sensors that behave in a logarithmic fashion thus supporting the earlier proposed postulates based on computational sensitivity analysis of this manuscript regarding the existence of logarithmic behaviour in the signaling pathways. It also signifies the importance of systems biology approach where in silico experiments combined with in vivo/in vitro experiments have the power to explore the deeper mechanisms of a signaling pathway. Additionally, it is hypothesized that these laws are prevalent at gene-gene interaction level also. The interactions were obtained by thresholding the inferred conditional probabilities of a gene activation given the status of another gene activation. The deviation in the interactions in normal/tumor samples was similarly observed by varying the initially assigned values of conditional probability tables (cpt) for TRCMPLX. Analysis of deviation in interactions show prevalence of psychophysical laws and is reported for interaction between elements of pairs (SFRP3, MYC), (SFRP2, CD44) and (DKK1, DACT2). Based on crude static models, it is assumed that dynamic models of Bayesian networks might reveal the phenomena in a better way.",

    "abstract": "Distant metastasis (DM) and local-regional recurrence (LR) after radiation and chemo therapy are major cause of treatment failure for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, detailed underlying mechanisms leading to DM and LR in patients are not fully understood yet. MiRNA have been proposed as biomarkers in a variety of biological and medical conditions such as cancer and stress response. The advantages of miRNA as a biomarker lies in its stability in tissues as well as body fluids, hence the potential for non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, towards understanding the molecular mechanism causing DM and LR in HN cancer patients we performed miRNA expression profiling using tumor samples from 118 head and neck cancer patients treated by post-operative radiotherapy (PORT) at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1992 to 1999. All patients were considered to be at high-risk for recurrence having histologically proven advanced squamous cell carcinoma. Amongst these samples, 41 found to have distant metastasis (DM), 53 responded without relapse (no evidence of disease (NED)) to PORT. Comparison of miRNA expression between DM and NED specimens using two-way ANOVA identified 28 miRNAs that were differentially expressed with statistical significance (FDR < 0.2 and fold change > 1.5). Amongst these 28 miRNAs seen in the DM and NED outcome groups, miRNAs 551a and 551b are significantly associated with the DM group. Interestingly these two miRNAs share same seed sequence. Moreover Kaplan-Meir survival analysis in our data set and two other data sets suggested that miR-551a and miR-551b expressions are associated with poor survival in patients. We further performed cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays using the HN5 and UMSCC-17B head and neck cancer cell lines by transfection of either mimic or an inhibitor of miR-551a and miR-551b. The results suggested that miR-551a and miR-551b mimics promote proliferation, migration and invasion whereas the inhibitor decreased. Further studies indicated that these miRNAs target GLIPR2 expression and miR-551a, miR-551b and GLIPR2 axis at least in part plays an important role in tumor progression. Hence we need to further explore miR-551a and miR-551b-3p role in HN cancer progression in detail in in-vivo models to use them as therapeutic targets in future.",

    "abstract": "Organisms and ecological groups accumulate evidence to make decisions. Classic experiments and theoretical studies have explored this process when the correct choice is fixed during each trial. However, the natural world constantly changes. Using sequential analysis we derive a tractable model of evidence accumulation when the correct option changes in time. Our analysis shows that ideal observers discount prior evidence at a rate determined by the volatility of the environment, and that the dynamics of evidence accumulation is governed by the information gained over an average environmental epoch. A plausible neural implementation of an optimal observer in a changing environment shows that, in contrast to previous models, neural populations representing alternate choices are coupled through excitation.",

    "abstract": "We elaborate a framework for investigating the evolutionary history of morphological characters. We argue that morphological character trees generated by phylogenetic analysis of transcriptomes provide a useful tool for identifying causal gene expression differences underlying the development and evolution of morphological characters. They also enable rigorous testing of different models of morphological character evolution and origination, including the hypothesis that characters originate via divergence of repeated ancestral characters. Finally, morphological character trees provide evidence that character transcriptomes undergo concerted evolution. We argue that concerted evolution of transcriptomes can explain the so-called \\\"species-specific clustering\\\" found in several recent comparative transcriptome studies. The species signal is the phenomenon that transcriptomes cluster by species rather than character type, even though the characters are older than the respective species. We suggest that concerted gene expression evolution results from mutations that alter gene regulatory network interactions shared by the characters under comparison. Thus, character trees generated from transcriptomes allow us to investigate the variational independence, or individuation, of morphological characters at the level of genetic programs.",

    "abstract": "Background: The human genome contains variants ranging in size from small single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to large structural variants (SVs). High-quality benchmark small variant calls for the pilot National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Reference Material (NA12878) have been developed by the Genome in a Bottle Consortium, but no similar high-quality benchmark SV calls exist for this genome. Since SV callers output highly discordant results, we developed methods to combine multiple forms of evidence from multiple sequencing technologies to classify candidate SVs into likely true or false positives. Our method (svclassify) calculates annotations from one or more aligned bam files from many high-throughput sequencing technologies, and then builds a one-class model using these annotations to classify candidate SVs as likely true or false positives.\\n\\nResults: We first used pedigree analysis to develop a set of high-confidence breakpoint-resolved large deletions. We then used svclassify to cluster and classify these deletions as well as a set of high-confidence deletions from the 1000 Genomes Project and a set of breakpoint-resolved complex insertions from Spiral Genetics. We find that likely SVs cluster separately from likely non-SVs based on our annotations, and that the SVs cluster into different types of deletions. We then developed a supervised one-class classification method that uses a training set of random non-SV regions to determine whether candidate SVs have abnormal annotations different from most of the genome. To test this classification method, we use our pedigree-based breakpoint-resolved SVs, SVs validated by the 1000 Genomes Project, and assembly-based breakpoint-resolved insertions, along with semi-automated visualization using svviz.\\n\\nConclusions: We find that candidate SVs with high scores from multiple technologies have high concordance with PCR validation and an orthogonal consensus method MetaSV (99.7% concordant), and candidate SVs with low scores are questionable. We distribute a set of 2676 high-confidence deletions and 68 high-confidence insertions with high svclassify scores from these call sets for benchmarking SV callers. We expect these methods to be particularly useful for establishing high-confidence SV calls for benchmark samples that have been characterized by multiple technologies.",
