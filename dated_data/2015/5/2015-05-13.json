    "abstract": "For tissues to carry out their functions, they rely on the right proteins to be present. Several high-throughput technologies have been used to map out which proteins are expressed in which tissues; however, the data have not previously been systematically compared and integrated. We present a comprehensive evaluation of tissue expression data from a variety of experimental techniques and show that these agree surprisingly well with each other and with results from literature curation and text mining. We further found that most datasets support the assumed but not demonstrated distinction between tissue-specific and ubiquitous expression. By developing comparable confidence scores for all types of evidence, we show that it is possible to improve both quality and coverage by combining the datasets. To facilitate use and visualization of our work, we have developed the TISSUES resource (http://tissues.jensenlab.org), which makes all the scored and integrated data available through a single user-friendly web interface.",

    "abstract": "Under modern interrogation, famously well-studied neural circuits such as that for orientation tuning in V1 are steadily giving up their secrets, but quite basic questions about connectivity and dynamics, including whether most computation is done by lateral processing or by selective feedforward summation, remain unresolved. We show here that grid cells offer a particularly rich opportunity for dissecting the mechanistic underpinnings of a cortical circuit, through a strategy based on global circuit perturbation combined with sparse neural recordings. The strategy is based on the theoretical insight that small perturbations of circuit activity will result in characteristic quantal shifts in the spatial tuning relationships between grid cells, which should be observable from multisingle unit recordings of a small subsample of the population. The predicted shifts differ qualitatively across candidate recurrent network mechanisms, and also distinguish between recurrent versus feedforward mechanisms. More generally, the proposed strategy demonstrates how sparse neural recordings coupled with global perturbation in the grid cell system can reveal much more about circuit mechanism as it relates to function than can full knowledge of network activity or of the synaptic connectivity matrix.",

Interrogating these datasets can provide detailed insights into the genetic structure of of prokaryotic genomes. We introduce Roary, a tool that rapidly builds large-scale pan genomes, identifying the core and dispensable accessory genes. Roary makes construction of the pan genome of thousands of prokaryote samples possible on a standard desktop without compromising on the accuracy of results. Using a single CPU Roary can produce a pan genome consisting of 1000 isolates in 4.5 hours using 13 GB of RAM, with further speedups possible using multiple processors.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationRoary is implemented in Perl and is freely available under an open source GPLv3 license from http://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary\\n\\nContactroary@sanger.ac.uk\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

We envisage a low side effect profile and that NADH therapy will, additionally, combat the wastage and weakness of cancer patients, which can be the cause of death in some cases. Significantly, NADH can be administered orally and has already cleared clinical trials, all be it for other pathologies.\\n\\nBackgroundAerobic respiration consists of glycolysis in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria: the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [1, 2]. It requires O2 and net yields 30 ATPs from one glucose molecule. Anaerobic respiration, consisting of glycolysis only, does not require O2 but produces merely 2 ATPs from one glucose molecule. When O2 is available, normal animal cells tend to favour aerobic respiration because of its higher ATP yield.",

    "abstract": "Genome scans, including both genome-wide association studies and deep sequencing, continue to discover a growing number of significant association signals for various traits. However, often variants meeting genome-wide significance criteria explain far less of the overall trait variance than \\\"sub-threshold\\\" association signals. To extract these sub-threshold signals, there is a need for methods which accurately estimate the mean of all (normally-distributed) test-statistics from a genome scan (i.e., Z-scores). This is currently achieved by the difficult procedures of adjusting all Z-score [Formula] statistics for \\\"winners curse\\\" (multiple testing). Given that multiple testing adjustments are much simpler for p-values, we propose a method for estimating Z-scores means by i) first adjusting their p-values for multiple testing and then ii) transforming the adjusted p-values to upper tail Z-scores with the sign of the original statistics. Because a False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure is used for multiple testing adjustment, we denote this method FDR Inverse Quantile Transformation (FIQT). When compared to competitors, e.g. Empirical Bayes (including proposed improvements), FIQT is more i) accurate and ii) computationally efficient by orders of magnitude. Its accuracy advantage is substantial at larger sample sizes and/or moderate numbers of association signals. Practical application of FIQT to Z-scores from the first Psychiatric Genetic Consortium (PGC) schizophrenia predicts a non-trivial fraction of the significant signal regions from the subsequent published PGC schizophrenia studies. Finally, we suggest that FIQT might be i) used to improve subject level risk prediction and ii) further improved by modelling the noncentrality of [Formula] statistics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHigh throughput sequencing (HTS) has become one of the primary experimental tools used to extract genomic information from biological samples. Bioinformatics tools are continuously being developed for the analysis of HTS data. Beyond some well-defined core analyses, such as quality control or genomic alignment, the consistent development of custom tools and the representation of sequencing data in organized computational structures and entities remains a challenging effort for bioinformaticians.\\n\\nResultsIn this work, we present GenOO [jee-noo], an open-source; object-oriented (OO) Perl framework specifically developed for the design and implementation of HTS analysis tools. GenOO models biological entities such as genes and transcripts as Perl objects, and includes relevant modules, attributes and methods that allow for the manipulation of high throughput sequencing data. GenOO integrates these elements in a simple and transparent way which allows for the creation of complex analysis pipelines minimizing the overhead for the researcher. GenOO has been designed with flexibility in mind, and has an easily extendable modular structure with minimal requirements for external tools and libraries. As an example of the frameworks capabilities and usability, we present a short and simple walkthrough of a custom use case in HTS analysis.\\n\\nConclusionsGenOO is a tool of high software quality which can be efficiently used for advanced HTS analyses. It has been used to develop several custom analysis tools, leading to a number of published works. Using GenOO as a core development module can greatly benefit users, by reducing the overhead and complexity of managing HTS data and biological entities at hand.",

    "abstract": "The study of microbial evolution is hindered by the fact that microbial populations leave few fossils. We hypothesized that bacterial cells preserved in ancient ice could be used as a molecular fossil record if their DNA could be extracted and sequenced. Channels formed along triple junctions of ice crystals contain liquid \\\"veins\\\" in which microbial cells may be preserved intact. Since vertical motion through the ice matrix is impossible, microbes found in ice cores are representative of microbes present at the time the ice was formed. We detected chlorophyll fluorescence in intact ice cores taken from Greenland and Antarctica. Flow cytometric analysis localized at least some of this fluorescence to particles < 1 m in diameter. Metagenomic analysis of meltwater indeed revealed sequences similar to modern strains of the picocyanobacterial genera Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, and some of these sequences were distinct from any sequences known from modern oceans or glacial environments. Our study is a first proof-of-concept of the use of ice cores as records of microbial evolution, and we suggest that future genetic studies with higher vertical resolution in the cores might shed light on the pace and character of evolution of these ecologically important cells.",
