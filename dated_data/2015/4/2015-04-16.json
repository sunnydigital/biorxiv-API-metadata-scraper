    "abstract": "For a scientific discipline to be interdisciplinary it must satisfy two conditions; it must consist of contributions from at least two existing disciplines and it must be able to provide insights, through this interaction, that neither progenitor discipline could address. In this paper, I examine the complete body of peer-reviewed literature self-identified as landscape genetics using the statistical approaches of text mining and natural language processing. The goal here is to quantify the kinds of questions being addressed in landscape genetic studies, the ways in which questions are evaluated mechanistically, and how they are differentiated from the progenitor disciplines of landscape ecology and population genetics. I then circumscribe the main factions within published landscape genetic papers examining the extent to which emergent questions are being addressed and highlighting a deep bifurcation between existing individual- and population-based approaches. I close by providing some suggestions on where theoretical and analytical work is needed if landscape genetics is to serve as a real bridge connecting evolution and ecology sensu lato.",

    "abstract": "It is increasingly argued that cancer stem cells are not a cellular phenotype but rather a transient state that cells can acquire, either through intrinsic signaling cascades or in response to environmental cues. While cancer stem cell plasticity is generally associated with increased aggressiveness and treatment resistance, we set out to thoroughly investigate the impact of different rates of plasticity on early and late tumor growth dynamics and the response to therapy. We develop an agent-based model of cancer stem cell driven tumor growth, in which plasticity is defined as a spontaneous transition between stem and non-stem cancer cell states. Simulations of the model show that plasticity can substantially increase tumor growth rate and invasion. At high rates of plasticity, however, the cells get exhausted and the tumor will undergo spontaneous remission in the long term. In a series of in silico trials we show that such remission can be facilitated through radiotherapy. The presented study suggests that stem cell plasticity has rather complex, non-intuitive implications on tumor growth and treatment response. Further theoretical, experimental and integrated studies are needed to fully decipher cancer stem cell plasticity and how it can be harnessed for novel therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "For efficient background matching it is essential that animals closely match a set of salient visual statistics of their visual surroundings. The mean intensity of a background is a key statistic, because it can be estimated across a large range of viewing distances by a simple computation. We investigated how the dynamic neuromuscular camouflage system of the cuttlefish Sepia offcinalis responds to changes in the mean background intensity of uniform backgrounds. We find that cuttlefish adapt their body intensity in response to variations in the mean background intensity, yet show biases in their body intensity beyond what can be predicted from the limited dynamic range of their camouflage system. On sandy backgrounds of various reflectance values their uniform body patterns maintain a constant yellow hue. This color constancy may represent an example of a color prior in a colorblind animal because a yellow body color would be the optimal hue for camouflage on sands typically encountered in their natural environment. Cuttlefish adapt their appearance to the background via a dynamic process composed of a complex mixture of intensity transients spanning timescales from the subsecond to the minute range. In very young animals camouflaging on dark sands the masquerade strategy is preferred over background matching. Masquerade is implemented by combining partial background matching with frequent expression of disruptive components. We furthermore provide an objective definition of disruptive components using hierarchical clustering and automated image analysis thus highlighting the role of chromatophore activity correlations in structuring the motor output of S.officinalis.",

    "abstract": "The use of genomic data in the clinic has not been as widespread as was envisioned when sequencing and genomic analysis became common techniques. An underlying difficulty is the direct assessment of how much additional information genomic data are providing beyond standard clinical measurements. This is hard to quantify in the clinical setting where laboratory tests based on genomic signatures are fairly new and there are not sufficient data collected to determine how valuable these tests have been in practice. Here we focus on the potential precision gain from using the popular MammaPrint genomic signature in a covariate-adjusted, randomized clinical trial. We describe how adjustment of an estimator for the average treatment effect using baseline measurements can improve precision. This precision gain can be translated directly into sample size reduction and corresponding cost savings. We conduct a simulation study using genomic and clinical data gathered for breast cancer patients and find that adjusting for clinical factors alone provides a gain in precision of 5-6%, adjusting for genomic factors alone provides a similar gain (5%), and combining the two yields a 2-3% additional gain over only adjusting for clinical covariates.",

For example, do low levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cause heart disease? Does high body mass index (BMI) cause type 2 diabetes? Or are these traits simply correlated in the population for other reasons? The gold standard study design for answering this type of question is the randomized controlled trial, which requires identifying an intervention that influences the potential causal factor (for example a drug), randomly assigning individuals to receive the intervention, and monitoring outcomes. In this study design, the use of randomization allows one to isolate the causal effect of a single variable (e.g. the drug) from the effects of potential confounding variables. However ...",

    "abstract": "Searching for genetic variants with unusual differentiation between subpopulations is an established approach for identifying signals of natural selection. However, existing methods generally require discrete subpopulations. We introduce a method that infers selection using principal components (PCs) by identifying variants whose differentiation along top PCs is significantly greater than the null distribution of genetic drift. To enable the application of this method to large data sets, we developed the FastPCA software, which employs recent advances in random matrix theory to accurately approximate top PCs while reducing time and memory cost from quadratic to linear in the number of individuals, a computational improvement of many orders of magnitude. We apply FastPCA to a cohort of 54,734 European Americans, identifying 5 distinct subpopulations spanning the top 4 PCs. Using the PC-based test for natural selection, we replicate previously known selected loci and identify three new genome-wide significant signals of selection, including selection in Europeans at the ADH1B gene. The coding variant rs1229984*T has previously been associated to a decreased risk of alcoholism and shown to be under selection in East Asians; we show that it is a rare example of independent evolution on two continents. We also detect new selection signals at IGFBP3 and IGH, which have also previously been associated to human disease.",

    "abstract": "We assembled teams of genomics professionals to assess whether we could rapidly develop pipelines to answer biological questions commonly asked by biologists and others new to bioinformatics by facilitating analysis of high-throughput sequencing data. In January 2015, teams were assembled on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) campus to address questions in the DNA-seq, epigenomics, metagenomics and RNA-seq subfields of genomics. The only two rules for this hackathon were that either the data used were housed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or would be submitted there by a participant in the next six months, and that all software going into the pipeline was open-source or open-use. Questions proposed by organizers, as well as suggested tools and approaches, were distributed to participants a few days before the event and were refined during the event. Pipelines were published on GitHub, a web service providing publicly available, free-usage tiers for collaborative software development (https://github.com/features/). The code was published at https://github.com/DCGenomics/ with separate repositories for each team, starting with hackathon_v001.",
