    "abstract": "Extracting biologically meaningful information from the continuing flood of genomic data is a major challenge in the life sciences. Codon usage bias (CUB) is a general feature of most genomes and is thought to reflect the effects of both natural selection for efficient translation and mutation bias. Here we present a mechanistically interpretable, Bayesian model (ROC SEMPPR) to extract biologically meaningful information from patterns of CUB within a genome. ROC SEMPPR, is grounded in population genetics and allows us to separate the contributions of mutational biases and natural selection against translational inefficiency on a gene by gene and codon by codon basis. Until now, the primary disadvantage of similar approaches was the need for genome scale measurements of gene expression. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to both extract accurate estimates of codon specific mutation biases and translational efficiencies while simultaneously generating accurate estimates of gene expression, rather than requiring such information. We demonstrate the utility of ROC SEMPPR using the S. cerevisiae S288c genome. When we compare our model fits with previous approaches we observe an exceptionally high agreement between estimates of both codon specific parameters and gene expression levels ({rho} > 0.99 in all cases). We also observe strong agreement between our parameter estimates and those derived from alternative datasets. For example, our estimates of mutation bias and those from mutational accumulation exper-iments are highly correlated ({rho} = 0.95). Our estimates of codon specific translational inefficiencies are tRNA copy number based estimates of ribosome pausing time ({rho} = 0.64), and mRNA and ribosome profiling footprint based estimates of gene expression ({rho} = 0.53 - 0.74) are also highly correlated, thus supporting the hypothesis that selection against translational inefficiency is an important force driving the evolution of CUB. Surprisingly, we find that for particular amino acids, codon usage in highly expressed genes can still be largely driven by mutation bias and that failing to take mutation bias into account can lead to the misidentification of an amino acids  optimal codon. In conclusion, our method demonstrates that an enormous amount of biologically important information is encoded within genome scale patterns of codon usage, accessing this information does not require gene expression measurements, but instead carefully formulated biologically interpretable models.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCorals are capable of launching diverse immune defenses at the site of direct contact with pathogens, but the molecular mechanisms of this activity and the colony-wide effects of such stressors remain poorly understood. Here we compared gene expression profiles in eight healthy Acropora hyacinthus colonies against eight colonies exhibiting tissue loss commonly associated with white syndromes, all collected from a natural reef environment near Palau. Two types of tissues were sampled from diseased corals: visibly affected and apparently healthy.\\n\\nResultsTag-based RNA-Seq followed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified groups of co-regulated differentially expressed genes between all health states (disease lesion, apparently healthy tissues of diseased colonies, and fully healthy). Differences between healthy and diseased tissues indicate activation of several innate immunity and tissue repair pathways accompanied by reduced calcification and the switch towards metabolic reliance on stored lipids. Unaffected parts of diseased colonies, although displaying a trend towards these changes, were not significantly different from fully healthy samples. Still, network analysis identified a group of genes, suggestive of altered immunity state, that were specifically up-regulated in unaffected parts of diseased colonies.\\n\\nConclusionsSimilarity of fully healthy samples to apparently healthy parts of diseased colonies indicates that systemic effects of white syndromes on A. hyacinthus are weak, which implies that the coral colony is largely able to sustain its physiological performance despite disease. The genes specifically up-regulated in unaffected parts of diseased colonies, instead of being the consequence of disease, might be related to the originally higher susceptibility of these colonies to naturally occurring white syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Many biologically important traits are binomially distributed, with their key phenotypes being presence or absence. Despite their prevalence, estimating the heritability of binomial traits presents both experimental and statistical challenges. Here we develop both an empirical and computational methodology for estimating the narrow-sense heritability of binary traits for highly fecund species. Our experimental approach controls for undesirable culturing effects, while minimizing culture numbers, increasing feasibility in the field. Our statistical approach accounts for known issues with model-selection by using a permutation test to calculate significance values and includes both fitting and power calculation methods. We illustrate our methodology by estimating the narrow-sense heritability for larval settlement, a key life-history trait, in the reef-building coral Orbicella faveolata. The experimental, statistical and computational methods, along with all of the data from this study, were deployed in the R package multiDimBio.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are major drivers of genomic and phenotypic evolution, yet many questions about their biology remain poorly understood. Here, we compare TE abundance between populations of the two sister species D. mauritiana und D. simulans and relate it to the more distantly related D. melanogaster. The low population frequency of most TE insertions in D. melanogaster and D. simulans has been a key feature of several models of TE evolution. In D. mauritiana, however, the majority of TE insertions are fixed (66%). We attribute this to a lower transposition activity of up to 47 TE families in D. mauritiana, rather than stronger purifying selection. Only three families, including the extensively studied Mariner, may have a higher activity in D. mauritiana. This remarkable difference in TE activity between two recently diverged Drosophila species ({approx} 250,000 years), also supports the hypothesis that TE copy numbers in Drosophila may not reflect a stable equilibrium where the rate of TE gains equals the rate of TE losses by negative selection. We propose that the transposition rate heterogeneity results from the contrasting ecology of the two species: the extent of vertical extinction of TE families and horizontal acquisition of active TE copies may be very different between the colonizing D. simulans and the island endemic D. mauritiana. Our findings provide novel insights in the evolution of TEs in Drosophila and suggest that the ecology of the host species could be a major, yet underappreciated, factor governing the evolutionary dynamics of TEs.",

    "abstract": "benchmarkR is an R package designed to assess and visualize the performance of statistical methods for datasets that have an independent truth (e.g., simulations or datasets with large-scale validation), in particular for methods that claim to control false discovery rates (FDR). We augment some of the standard performance plots (e.g., receiver operating characteristic, or ROC, curves) with information about how well the methods are calibrated (i.e., whether they achieve their expected FDR control). For example, performance plots are extended with a point to highlight the power or FDR at a user-set threshold (e.g., at a method's estimated 5% FDR). The package contains general containers to store simulation results (SimResults) and methods to create graphical summaries, such as receiver operating characteristic curves (rocX), false discovery plots (fdX) and power-to-achieved FDR plots (powerFDR); each plot is augmented with some form of calibration information. We find these plots to be an improved way to interpret relative performance of statistical methods for genomic datasets where many hypothesis tests are performed. The strategies, however, are general and will find applications in other domains.",
