    "abstract": "Many classical ecological and evolutionary theoretical frameworks posit that competition between species is an important selective force. For example, in adaptive radiations, resource competition between evolving lineages plays a role in driving phenotypic diversification and exploration of novel ecological space. Nevertheless, current models of trait evolution fit to phylogenies and comparative datasets are not designed to incorporate the effect of competition. The most advanced models in this direction are diversity-dependent models where evolutionary rates depend on lineage diversity. However, these models still treat changes in traits in one branch as independent of the value of traits on other branches, thus ignoring the effect of species similarity on trait evolution. Here, we consider a model where the evolutionary dynamics of traits involved in interspecific interactions are influenced by species similarity in trait values and where we can specify which lineages are in sympatry. We develop a maximum-likelihood based approach to fit this model to combined phylogenetic and phenotypic data. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the approach accurately estimates the simulated parameter values across a broad range of parameter space. Additionally, we develop tools for specifying the biogeographic context in which trait evolution occurs. In order to compare models, we also apply these biogeographic methods to specify which lineages interact sympatrically for two diversity-dependent models. Finally, we fit these various models to morphological data from a classical adaptive radiation (Greater Antillean Anolis lizards). We show that models that account for competition and geography perform better than other models. The matching competition model is an important new tool for studying the influence of interspecific interactions, in particular competition, on phenotypic evolution. More generally, it constitutes a step toward a better integration of interspecific interactions in many ecological and evolutionary processes.",

    "abstract": "To the Editor To the Editor References Recent progress in genome editing technologies, in particular the CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease system, has provided new opportunities to investigate the biological functions of genomic sequences by targeted mutagenesis [1-4]. Briefly, Cas9 may be directed by a chimeric single guide RNA (sgRNA) to a target genomic sequence upstream of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) for cleavage. Double strand breaks (DSBs) resulting from site-specific Cas9 cleavage can be resolved by endogenous DNA repair pathways such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR). These repair mechanisms result in a spectrum of diverse outcomes including insertions, deletions, nucleotide substitutions, and, in the case of HDR, recombination of extrachromosomal donor sequences [1-3, 5 ...",

    "abstract": "The microbiome is the collection of all microbial genes and can be investigated by sequencing highly variable regions of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Evidence suggests that environmental factors and host genetics may interact to impact human microbiome composition. Identifying host genetic variants associated with human microbiome composition not only provides clues for characterizing microbiome variation but also helps to elucidate biological mechanisms of genetic associations, prioritize genetic variants, and improve genetic risk prediction. Since a microbiota functions as a community, it is best characterized by beta diversity, that is, a pairwise distance matrix. We develop a statistical framework and a computationally efficient software package, microbiomeGWAS, for identifying host genetic variants associated with microbiome beta diversity with or without interacting with an environmental factor. We show that score statistics have positive skewness and kurtosis due to the dependent nature of the pairwise data, which makes P-value approximations based on asymptotic distributions unacceptably liberal. By correcting for skewness and kurtosis, we develop accurate P-value approximations, whose accuracy was verified by extensive simulations. We exemplify our methods by analyzing a set of 147 genotyped subjects with 16S rRNA microbiome profiles from non-malignant lung tissues. Correcting for skewness and kurtosis eliminated the dramatic deviation in the quantile-quantile plots. We provided preliminary evidence that six established lung cancer risk SNPs were collectively associated with microbiome composition for both unweighted (P=0.0032) and weighted (P=0.011) UniFrac distance matrices. In summary, our methods will facilitate analyzing large-scale genome-wide association studies of the human microbiome.",

    "abstract": "O_LIEstimates of age-specific mortality are regularly used in ecology, evolution, and conservation research. However, existing methods to estimate mortality from re-sighting records of marked individuals fail at estimating mortality of males for species with male natal dispersal due to the uncertainty surrounding disappearances of adult males from study populations.\\nC_LIO_LIHere, we develop a mortality model that imputes dispersal state (i.e., died or left) for uncertain male records as a latent state jointly with the coefficients of a parametric mortality model in a Bayesian hierarchical framework. To check the performance of our model, we first conduct a simulation study. We then apply our model to a long-term data set for African lions. Using these data, we further scrutinise the mortality estimates derived from our model by incrementally reducing the level of uncertainty in the male records. We achieve this by taking advantage of an experts intuition on the likely fate of each uncertain male record.\\nC_LIO_LIWe find that our new model produces accurate mortality parameters for simulated data of varying sample sizes and proportions of uncertain male records. From the empirical study we learned that our model provides similar mortality estimates for different levels of uncertainty in male records. However, a sensitivity of the mortality estimates to varying uncertainty is, as can be expected, detectable.\\nC_LIO_LIWe conclude that our model provides a solution to the challenge of estimating male mortality in species with data-deficiency for males due to natal dispersal. Given the utility of sex-specific mortality estimates in biological and conservation research and the virtual ubiquity of sex-biased dispersal, our model will be useful to a wide variety of applications.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "When the brain has determined the position of a moving object, due to anatomical and processing delays, the object will have already moved to a new location. Given the statistical regularities present in natural motion, the brain may have acquired compensatory mechanisms to minimize the mismatch between the perceived and the real position of a moving object. A well-known visual illusion -- the flash lag effect -- points towards such a possibility. Although many psychophysical models have been suggested to explain this illusion, their predictions have not been tested at the neural level, particularly in a species of animal known to perceive the illusion. Towards this, we recorded neural responses to flashed and moving bars from primary visual cortex (V1) of awake, fixating macaque monkeys. We found that the response latency to moving bars of varying speed, motion direction and luminance was shorter than that to flashes, in a manner that is consistent with psychophysical results. At the level of V1, our results support the differential latency model positing that flashed and moving bars have different latencies. As we found a neural correlate of the illusion in passively fixating monkeys, our results also suggest that judging the instantaneous position of the moving bar at the time of flash -- as required by the postdiction/motion-biasing model -- may not be necessary for observing a neural correlate of the illusion. Our results also suggest that the brain may have evolved mechanisms to process moving stimuli faster and closer to real time compared with briefly appearing stationary stimuli.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyWe report several observations in awake macaque V1 that provide support for the differential latency model of the flash lag illusion. We find that the equal latency of flash and moving stimuli as assumed by motion integration/postdiction models does not hold in V1. We show that in macaque V1, motion processing latency depends on stimulus luminance, speed and motion direction in a manner consistent with several psychophysical properties of the flash lag illusion.",

    "abstract": "There is considerable evidence that people with higher levels of the personality trait neuroticism have an increased risk of several types of mental disorder. Higher neuroticism has also been associated, less consistently, with increased risk of various physical health outcomes. We hypothesised that these associations may, in part, be due to shared genetic influences. We tested for pleiotropy between neuroticism and 12 mental and physical diseases or health traits using linkage disequilibrium regression and polygenic profile scoring. Genetic correlations were derived between neuroticism scores in 108 038 people in UK Biobank and health-related measures from 12 large genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Summary information for the 12 GWAS was used to create polygenic risk scores for the health-related measures in the UK Biobank participants. Associations between the health-related polygenic scores and neuroticism were examined using regression, adjusting for age, sex, genotyping batch, genotyping array, assessment centre, and population stratification. Genetic correlations were identified between neuroticism and anorexia nervosa (rg = 0.17), major depressive disorder (rg = 0.66) and schizophrenia (rg = 0.21). Polygenic risk for several health-related measures were associated with neuroticism, in a positive direction in the case of bipolar disorder ({beta} = 0.017), major depressive disorder ({beta} = 0.036), schizophrenia ({beta} = 0.036), and coronary artery disease ({beta} = 0.011), and in a negative direction in the case of BMI ({beta} = -0.0095). These findings indicate that a high level of pleiotropy exists between neuroticism and some measures of mental and physical health, particularly major depressive disorder and schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "The causes of the known associations between poorer cognitive function and many adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes, poorer physical health, and earlier death remain unknown. We used linkage disequilibrium regression and polygenic profile scoring to test for shared genetic aetiology between cognitive functions and neuropsychiatric disorders and physical health. Using information provided by many published genome-wide association study consortia, we created polygenic profile scores for 24 vascular-metabolic, neuropsychiatric, physiological-anthropometric, and cognitive traits in the participants of UK Biobank, a very large population-based sample (N = 112 151). Pleiotropy between cognitive and health traits was quantified by deriving genetic correlations using summary genome-wide association study statistics applied to the method of linkage disequilibrium regression. Substantial and significant genetic correlations were observed between cognitive test scores in the UK Biobank sample and many of the mental and physical health-related traits and disorders assessed here. In addition, highly significant associations were observed between the cognitive test scores in the UK Biobank sample and many polygenic profile scores, including coronary artery disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, autism, major depressive disorder, BMI, intracranial volume, infant head circumference, and childhood cognitive ability. Where disease diagnosis was available for UK Biobank participants we were able to show that these results were not confounded by those who had the relevant disease. These findings indicate that a substantial level of pleiotropy exists between cognitive abilities and many human mental and physical health disorders and traits and that it can be used to predict phenotypic variance across samples.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization and polyploidization are considered important driving forces that form new epigenetic regulations. To study the changing patterns of expression accompanying hybridization and polyploidization, we used RNA-seq and qPCR to investigate global expression and homoeologue expression in diploid and allotetraploid hybrids of Carassius auratus red var. ([female]) (R) and Cyprinus carpio ([male]) (C). By comparing the relative expression levels between the hybrids and their parents, we defined the expression level dominance (ELD) and homoeologue expression bias (HEB) in liver tissue. The results showed that polyploidization contributed to the conversion of homoeologue ELD. In addition, hybridization had more effect on the change in HEB than polyploidization, while polyploidization has been considered to have more effect on the change of global gene expression than hybridization. Meanwhile, similar expression patterns were found in growth-related genes. The results suggested that hybridization and polyploidization result in differential degrees of maternal HEB in the three tissues tested. The results of this study will increase our understanding of the underlying regulation mechanism of rapid growth in diploid hybrids and allotetraploids. The differential degrees of global expression and homoeologue expression contribute to growth heterosis in newly formed hybrids and allotetraploids, ensuring the on-going success of allopolyploid speciation.",

Here, we continue a morphometric analysis of >5,500 leaves representing 270 grapevines of multiple Vitis species between two growing seasons. Leaves are paired one-to-one, vine-to-vine accounting for developmental context, between growing seasons. Linear Discriminant Analysis reveals shape features that specifically define growing season, regardless of species or developmental context.

Here we demonstrate that high intracellular [Formula] enhances currents mediated by the guard cell S-type anion channel SLAC1 when co-expressing either of the protein kinases OST1, CPK6 or CPK23 in Xenopus oocytes. Split-ubiquitin screening identified the PIP2;1 aquaporin as an interactor of the {beta}CA4 carbonic anhydrase, which was confirmed in split luciferase, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. PIP2;1 exhibited CO2 permeability. Co-expression of {beta}CA4 and PIP2;1 with OST1-SLAC1 or CPK6/23-SLAC1 enabled extracellular CO2 enhancement of SLAC1 anion channel activity. An inactive PIP2;1 point mutation was identified which abrogated water and CO2 permeability and extracellular CO2 regulation of SLAC1 activity in Xenopus oocytes. These findings identify the CO2-permeable PIP2;1 aquaporin as key interactor of carbonic anhydrases, show functional reconstitution of extracellular CO2 signaling to ion channel regulation and implicate SLAC1 as a bicarbonate-responsive protein in CO2 regulation of S-type anion channels.",
