    "abstract": "The flagellum is a large proteinaceous organelle found at the surface of many bacteria, whose primary role is to allow motility through the rotation of a long extracellular filament. It is an essential virulence factor in many pathogenic species, and is also a priming component in the formation of antibiotic-resistant biofilms. The flagellum consists of the export apparatus and stator in the cytosol; the basal body, spanning the bacterial membrane(s) and periplasm; and the hook-filament, that protrudes away from the bacterial surface. Assembly of the bacterial flagellum is initiated by the formation of the basal body MS ring region, constituted of multiple copies of the protein FliF. Here, I report an analysis of the FliF sequence from various bacterial species, demonstrating that its periplasmic region is composed of a domain homologuous to that of the type III secretion system proteins PrgK, and of a second globular domain that possesses a similar fold to that of the sporulation complex component SpoIIIAG. I also describe that Chlamydia possesses an unusual FliF protein, lacking part of the PrgK homology domain and the SpoIIIAG-like domain, and fused to FliG at its C-terminus. Finally, I have combined the sequence analysis of FliF with the EM map of the MS ring, to propose the first atomic model for the FliF oligomer. These results further emphasize the similarity between the flagellum, T3SS and sporulation complex, and will facilitate further structural studies.",

    "abstract": "Deer farming is a significant international industry. For genetic improvement, using genomic tools, an ordered array of DNA variants and associated flanking sequence across the genome is required. This work reports a comparative assembly of the deer genome and subsequent DNA variant identification. Next generation sequencing combined with an existing bovine reference genome enabled the deer genome to be assembled sufficiently for large-scale SNP discovery. In total, 28 Gbp of sequence data were generated from seven Cervus elaphus (European red deer and Canadian elk) individuals. After aligning sequence to the bovine reference genome build UMD 3.0 and binning reads into one Mbp groups; reads were assembled and analyzed for SNPs. Greater than 99% of the non-repetitive fraction of the bovine genome was covered by deer chromosomal scaffolds. We identified 1.8 million SNPs meeting Illumina InfiniumII SNP chip technical threshold. Markers on the published Red x Pere David deer linkage map were aligned to both UMD3.0 and the new deer chromosomal scaffolds. This enabled deer linkage groups to be assigned to deer chromosomal scaffolds, although the mapping locations remain based on bovine order. Genotyping of 270 SNPs on a Sequenom MS system showed that 88% of SNPs identified could be amplified. Also, inheritance patterns showed no evidence of departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A comparative assembly of the deer genome, alignment with existing deer genetic linkage groups and SNP discovery has been successfully completed and validated facilitating application of genomic technologies for subsequent deer genetic improvement.",

    "abstract": "While eukaryotic noncoding RNAs have recently received intense scrutiny, it is becoming clear that bacterial transcription is at least as pervasive. Bacterial small RNAs and antisense RNAs (sRNAs) are often assumed to be noncoding, due to their lack of long open reading frames (ORFs). However, there are numerous examples of sRNAs encoding for small proteins, whether or not they also have a regulatory role at the RNA level. Here, we apply flexible machine learning techniques based on sequence features and comparative genomics to quantify the prevalence of sRNA ORFs under natural selection to maintain protein-coding function in phylogenetically diverse bacteria. A majority of annotated sRNAs have at least one ORF between 10 and 50 amino acids long, and we conservatively predict that 188{+/-}25.5 unannotated sRNA ORFs are under selection to maintain coding, an average of 13 per species considered here. This implies that overall at least 7.5 {+/-}0.3% of sRNAs have a coding ORF, and in some species at least 20% do. 84 {+/-} 9.8 of these novel coding ORFs have some antisense overlap to annotated ORFs. As experimental validation, many of our predictions are translated according to ribosome profiling data and are identified via mass spectrometry shotgun proteomics. B. subtilis sRNAs with coding ORFs are enriched for high expression in biofilms and confluent growth, and two S. pneumoniae sRNAs with coding ORFs are involved in virulence. sRNA coding ORFs are enriched for transmembrane domains and many are novel components of type I toxin/antitoxin systems. Our predictions for sRNA coding ORFs, including novel type I toxins, are freely available in a user-friendly format at http://disco-bac.web.pasteur.fr.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe hydride shift mechanism of D-Xylose Isomerase converts D-glucose to D-fructose. In this work, we compute features of a \\\"hydroxide once\\\" mechanism for the hydride shift with quantum chemical calculations based on the 3KCO (linear) and 3KCL (cyclic) X-ray/neutron structures. The rigid boundary conditions of the active site \\\"shoe-box\\\", together with ionization states and proton orientations, enables large scale electronic structure calculations of the entire active site with greatly reduced configuration sampling. In the reported hydroxide once mechanism, magnesium in the 2A ligation shifts to position 2B, ionizing the O2 proton of D-glucose, which is accepted by ASP-287. In this step a novel stabilization is discovered; the K183/D255 proton toggle, providing a ~10 kcal/mol stabilization through inductive polarization over 5[A]. Then, hydride shifts from glucose-O2 to glucose-O1 (the interconversion) generating hydroxide (once) from the catalytic water. This step is consistent with the observation of hyroxide in structure 3CWH, which we identify as a branch point. From this branch point, we find several routes to the solvent-free regeneration of catalytic water that is strongly exothermic (by ~20 kcal/mol), yielding one additional hydrogen bond more than the starting structure. This non-Michaelis behavior, strongly below the starting cyclic and linear total energy, explains the observed accumulation of hydroxide intermediate - we postulate that forming permissive ionization states, required for cyclization, may be the rate limiting step. In all, we find eight items of experimental correspondence supporting features of the putative hydroxide once mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Measures of similarity between diseases have been used for applications from discovering drug-target interactions to identifying disease-gene relationships. It is challenging to quantitatively compare diseases because much of what we know about them is captured in free text descriptions. Here we present an application of Latent Dirichlet Allocation as a way to measure similarity between diseases using textual descriptions. We learn latent topic representations of text from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man records and use them to compute similarity. We assess the performance of this approach by comparing our results to manually curated relationships from the Disease Ontology. Despite being unsupervised, our model recovers a records curated Disease Ontology relations with a mean Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve of 0.80. With low dimensional models, topics tend to represent higher level information about affected organ systems, while higher dimensional models capture more granular genetic and phenotypic information. We examine topic representations of diseases for mapping concepts between ontologies and for tagging existing text with concepts. We conclude topic modeling on disease text leads to a robust approach to computing similarity that does not depend on keywords or ontology.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock is a fundamental feature of gene regulation and cell physiology in eukaryotes and some prokaryotes, and an exemplar gene regulatory network in Systems Biology. The circadian system in Arabidopsis thaliana is complex in part due to its photo-transduction pathways. Analysis of natural genetic variation between Arabidopsis accessions Cape Verde Islands (Cvi-0) and Landsberg erecta (Ler) identified a major, temperature-specific Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) on chromosome V that altered the circadian period of leaf movement (Edwards et al., Genetics, 2005). We tested Near-Isogenic Lines (NILs) to confirm that Ler alleles at this PerCv5c QTL lengthened the circadian period at 12{degrees}C, with little effect at higher temperatures. The PHYTOCHROME C gene lies within the QTL interval, and contains multiple sequence variants. Plants carrying either a T-DNA-insertion into PHYC or a deletion of PHYC also lengthened circadian period under white light, except at 27{degrees}C. phyB and phyABE mutants lengthened period only at 12{degrees}C. These results extend recent data showing PhyC effects in red light, confirming the number of photoreceptor proteins implicated in the plant circadian system at eleven. The connection between light input mechanisms and temperature effects on the clock is reinforced. Natural genetic variation within PHYC is likely to underlie the PerCv5c QTL. Our results suggest that functional variation within the PHYC-Ler haplotype group might contribute to the evolution of the circadian system and possibly to clock-related phenotypes such as flowering time. These results have previously passed peer-review, so we provide them in this citable preprint.",

We describe herein, a protocol for sub-tomogram averaging from cryo-ET data using the RELION software. We describe how to calculate newly developed three-dimensional models for the contrast transfer function and the missing wedge of each sub-tomogram, and how to use these models for regularized-likelihood refinement. This approach has been implemented in the existing workflow for single-particle analysis, so that users may conveniently tap into existing capabilities of the RELION software. As example applications, we present analyses of purified hepatitis B capsid particles and S. cerevisiae 80S ribosomes. In both cases, we show that following initial classification, sub-tomogram averaging in RELION allows de novo generation of initial models, and provides high-resolution maps where secondary structure elements are resolved.",

    "abstract": "Microbiomes can aid in the protection of hosts from infection and disease, but the mechanisms underpinning these functions in complex environmental systems remain unresolved. Soils contain microbiomes that influence plant performance, including their susceptibility to disease. For example, some soil microorganisms produce antimicrobial compounds that suppress the growth of plant pathogens, which can provide benefits for sustainable agricultural management. Evidence shows that crop rotations increase soil fertility and tend to promote microbial diversity, and it has been hypothesized that crop rotations can enhance disease suppressive capacity, either through the influence of plant diversity impacting soil bacterial composition or through the increased abundance of disease suppressive microorganisms. In this study, we used a long-term field experiment to test the effects of crop diversity through time (i.e., rotations) on soil microbial diversity and disease suppressive capacity. We sampled soil from seven treatments along a crop diversity gradient (from monoculture to five crop species rotation) and a spring fallow (non-crop) treatment to examine crop diversity influence on soil microbiomes including bacteria that are capable of producing antifungal compounds. Crop diversity significantly influenced bacterial community composition, where the most diverse cropping systems with cover crops and fallow differed from bacterial communities in the 1-3 crop species diversity treatments. While soil bacterial diversity was about 4% lower in the most diverse crop rotation (corn-soy-wheat + 2 cover crops) compared to monoculture corn, crop diversity increased disease suppressive functional group prnD gene abundance in the more diverse rotation by about 9% compared to monocultures. Identifying patterns in microbial diversity and ecosystem function relationships can provide insight into microbiome management, which will require manipulating soil nutrients and resources mediated through plant diversity.",

    "abstract": "Data analysis tools have become essential to the study of biology. Here, we applied language workbench technology (LWT) to create data analysis languages tailored for biologists with a diverse range of experience: from beginners with no programming experience to expert bioinformaticians and statisticians. A key novelty of our approach is its ability to blend user interface with scripting in a single platform. This feature helps beginners and experts alike analyze data more productively. This new approach has several advantages over state of the art approaches currently popular for data analysis: experts can design simplified data analysis languages that require no programming experience, and behave like graphical user interfaces, yet have the advantages of scripting. We report on such a simple language, called MetaR, which we have used to teach complete beginners how to call differentially expressed genes and build heatmaps. We found that beginners can complete this task in less than 2 hours with MetaR, when more traditional teaching with R and its packages would require several training sessions (6-24hrs). Furthermore, MetaR seamlessly integrates with docker to enable reproducibility of analyses and simplified R package installations during training sessions. We used the same approach to develop the first composable R language. A composable language is a language that can be extended with micro-languages. We illustrate this capability with a Biomart micro-language designed to compose with R and help R programmers query Biomart interactively to assemble specific queries to retrieve data, (The same micro-language also composes with MetaR to help beginners query Biomart.) Our teaching experience suggests that language design with LWT can be a compelling approach for developing intelligent data analysis tools and can accelerate training for common data analysis task. LWT offers an interactive environment with the potential to promote exchanges between beginner and expert data analysts.",
