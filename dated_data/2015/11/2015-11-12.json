    "abstract": "Metabolomic profiling is an emerging technique in life sciences. Human studies using these techniques have been performed in a small number of individuals or have been targeted at a restricted number of metabolites. In this article, we propose a data analysis workflow to perform non-targeted metabolomic profiling in large human population-based studies using ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). We describe challenges and propose solutions for quality control, statistical analysis and annotation of metabolic features. Using the data analysis workflow, we detected more than 8,000 metabolic features in serum samples from 2,489 fasting individuals. As an illustrative example, we performed a non-targeted metabolome-wide association analysis of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and detected 407 metabolic features corresponding to 90 unique metabolites that could be replicated in an external population. Our results reveal unexpected biological associations, such as metabolites identified as monoacylphosphorylcholines (LysoPC) being negatively associated with hsCRP. R code and fragmentation spectra for all metabolites are made publically available. In conclusion, the results presented here illustrate the viability and potential of non-targeted metabolomic profiling in large population-based studies.",

    "abstract": "Tandem fluorescent protein timers (tFTs) report on protein age through time-dependent change in color, which can be exploited to study protein turnover and trafficking. Each tFT, composed of two fluorescent proteins (FPs) that differ in maturation kinetics, is suited to follow protein dynamics within a specific time range determined by the maturation rates of both FPs. So far tFTs were constructed by combining different slower-maturing red fluorescent proteins (redFPs) with the same faster-maturing superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP). Towards a comprehensive characterization of tFTs, we compare here tFTs composed of different faster-maturing greenFPs, while keeping the slower-maturing redFP constant (mCherry). Our results indicate that the greenFP maturation kinetics influences the time range of a tFT. Moreover, we observe that commonly used greenFPs can partially withstand proteasomal degradation due to the stability of the FP fold, which results in accumulation of tFT fragments in the cell. Depending on the order of FPs in the timer, incomplete proteasomal degradation either shifts the time range of the tFT towards slower time scales or precludes its use for measurements of protein turnover. We identify greenFPs that are efficiently degraded by the proteasome and provide simple guidelines for design of new tFTs.\\n\\nAbbreviationstFT - tandem fluorescent protein timer\\n\\nFP - fluorescent protein\\n\\ngreenFP - green fluorescent protein\\n\\nredFP - red fluorescent protein",

    "abstract": "Boolean Integrase Logic gates use phage integrases that respond to transcriptional signals to implement logical functions within living cells via DNA recombination. Control of biological systems using these logic gates has many applications, including biomanufacturing, healthcare, or environmental remediation. Gates are highly sensitive to background transcriptional noise producing unwanted integrase expression and uncontrolled, permanent gate switching. Consequently, connecting gates to novel control signals requires time-consuming directed evolution of regions regulating integrase expression. Here we present an approach in which the activity of an alkane biosensor is tuned to match levels of existing integrase control signals. By adjusting AlkS expression, we tuned the transcriptional output of Palkb to match the output of existing integrase controllers. We successfully connected Palkb to two integrases with different transcriptional control requirements and demonstrated the original logic function was conserved. Our method complements directed evolution approaches to connect Boolean integrate logic gates to novel transcriptional sources and will ultimately facilitate the systematic in silico design of gates responding to various control signals.",

It is difficult to model these components at the tissue (10-3-10-2m) scale, where individual cells cannot be represented without prohibitive computational burden. Assuming that same-kind components tend to cluster together, a multiphase approach can be applied to represent heterogeneous tumor tissue at this larger physical scale. This method enables simulating mixture of elements within tissues, e.g., geno-/phenotypic heterogeneity underlying mutation- or microenvironment-driven tumor progression. Further, by not explicitly tracking interfaces, this methodology facilitates realistic modeling of tissue in 3-D.",

    "abstract": "A major goal of biomedicine is to understand the function of every gene in the human genome.1 Null mutations can disrupt both copies of a given gene in humans and phenotypic analysis of such  human knockouts can provide insight into gene function. To date, comprehensive analysis of genes knocked out in humans has been limited by the fact that null mutations are infrequent in the general population and so, observing an individual homozygous null for a given gene is exceedingly rare.2,3 However, consanguineous unions are more likely to result in offspring who carry homozygous null mutations. In Pakistan, consanguinity rates are notably high.4 Here, we sequenced the protein-coding regions of 7,078 adult participants living in Pakistan and performed phenotypic analysis to identify homozygous null individuals and to understand consequences of complete gene disruption in humans. We enumerated 36,850 rare (<1 % minor allele frequency) null mutations. These homozygous null mutations led to complete inactivation of 961 genes in at least one participant. Homozygosity for null mutations at APOC3 was associated with absent plasma apolipoprotein C-III levels; at PLAG27, with absent enzymatic activity of soluble lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2; at CYP2F1, with higher plasma interleukin-8 concentrations; and at either A3GALT2 or NRG4, with markedly reduced plasma insulin C-peptide concentrations. After physiologic challenge with oral fat, APOC3 knockouts displayed marked blunting of the usual post-prandial rise in plasma triglycerides compared to wild-type family members. These observations provide a roadmap to understand the consequences of complete disruption of a large fraction of genes in the human genome.",

    "abstract": "Abstract.Pairwise sequence alignment is perhaps the most fundamental bioinformatics operation. An optimal global alignment algorithm was described in 1970 by Needleman and Wunsch. In 1982 Gotoh presented an improved algorithm with lower time complexity. Gotohs algorithm is frequently cited (1447 citations, Google Scholar, May 2015), taught and, most importantly, used as well as implemented. While implementing the algorithm, we discovered two mathematical mistakes in Gotohs paper that induce sub-optimal sequence alignments. First, there are minor indexing mistakes in the dynamic programming algorithm which become apparent immediately when implementing the procedure. Hence, we report on these for the sake of completeness. Second, there is a more profound problem with the dynamic programming matrix initialization. This initialization issue can easily be missed and find its way into actual implementations. This error is also present in standard text books. Namely, the widely used books by Gusfield and Waterman. To obtain an initial estimate of the extent to which this error has been propagated, we scrutinized freely available undergraduate lecture slides. We found that 8 out of 31 lecture slides contained the mistake, while 16 out of 31 simply omit parts of the initialization, thus giving an incomplete description of the algorithm. Finally, by inspecting ten source codes and running respective tests, we found that five implementations were incorrect. Note that, not all bugs we identified are due to the mistake in Gotohs paper. Three implementations rely on additional constraints that limit generality. Thus, only two out of ten yield correct results. We show that the error introduced by Gotoh is straightforward to resolve and provide a correct open-source reference implementation. We do believe though, that raising the awareness about these errors is critical, since the impact of incorrect pairwise sequence alignments that typically represent one of the very first stages in any bioinformatics data analysis pipeline can have a detrimental impact on downstream analyses such as multiple sequence alignment, orthology assignment, phylogenetic analyses, divergence time estimates, etc.",

    "abstract": "The movement of resources between terrestrial and aquatic habitats has strong effects on ecological processes in recipient ecosystems. Allochthonous inputs modify the quality and quantity of the available resource pool in ways that may alter the composition and stability of recipient communities. Inputs of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (tDOC) into aquatic ecosystems represent a large influx of resources that has the potential to affect local communities, especially microorganisms. To evaluate the effects terrestrial inputs on aquatic microbial community composition and stability, we manipulated the supply rate of tDOC to a set of experimental ponds. Along the tDOC supply gradient, we measured changes in diversity and taxon-specific changes in abundance and activity. We then determined community stability by perturbing each pond using a pulse of inorganic nutrients and measuring changes in composition and activity (i.e., responsiveness) along the gradient. Terrestrial DOC supply significantly altered the composition of the active microbial community. The composition of the active bacterial community changed via decreases in richness and evenness as well as taxon-specific changes in abundance and activity indicating species sorting along the gradient. Likewise, the responsiveness of the active bacterial community decreased along the gradient, which led to a more stable active community. We did not, however, observe these changes in diversity and stability in the total community (i.e., active and inactive organisms), which suggests that tDOC supply modifies microbial community stability through functional not structural changes. Together, these results show that altered aquatic terrestrial linkages can have profound effects on the activity and stability of the base of the food web and thus can alter ecosystem functioning.",

    "abstract": "Custom sequence capture experiments are becoming an efficient approach for gathering large sets of orthologous markers with targeted levels of informativeness in non-model organisms. Transcriptome-based exon capture utilizes transcript sequences to design capture probes, often with the aid of a reference genome to identify intron-exon boundaries and exclude shorter exons (< 200 bp). Here, we test an alternative approach that directly uses transcript sequences for probe design, which are often composed of multiple exons of varying lengths. Based on a selection of 1,260 orthologous transcripts, we conducted sequence captures across multiple phylogenetic scales for frogs, including species up to ~100 million years divergent from the focal group. After several conservative filtering steps, we recovered a large phylogenomic data set consisting of sequence alignments for 1,047 of the 1,260 transcriptome-based loci (~630,000 bp) and a large quantity of highly variable regions flanking the exons in transcripts (~70,000 bp). We recovered high numbers of both shorter (< 100 bp) and longer exons (> 200 bp), with no major reduction in coverage towards the ends of exons. We observed significant differences in the performance of blocking oligos for target enrichment and non-target depletion during captures, and observed differences in PCR duplication rates that can be attributed to the number of individuals pooled for capture reactions. We explicitly tested the effects of phylogenetic distance on capture sensitivity, specificity, and missing data, and provide a baseline estimate of expectations for these metrics based on nuclear pairwise differences among samples. We provide recommendations for transcriptome-based exon capture design based on our results, and describe multiple pipelines for data assembly and analysis.",

    "abstract": "Ash dieback due to Hymenoscyphus fraxineus is threatening the Fraxinus excelsior species in most of its natural range in Europe and it is becoming obvious that other species in the Fraxinus genus are susceptible to the disease. The fungal pathogen apparently originates from Asia where it may act as an endophyte of local species like F. mandshurica. Previous studies reported significant levels of genetic variability for susceptibility in F. excelsior either in field or inoculation experiments. The present study was based on a field experiment planted in 1995, fifteen years before onset of the disease. Crown and collar status were monitored on 788 trees from 23 open-pollinated progenies originating from 3 French provenances. Susceptibility was modelled using a Bayesian approach where spatio-temporal effects were explicitly taken into account, thus providing accurate narrow-sense heritability estimates (h2). While moderate narrow-sense heritability estimates for Crown Dieback (CD, h2 = 0.42 in this study) have already been reported in the literature, this study is first to show that Collar Lesions are also heritable (h2 = 0.49 for prevalence and h2 = 0.42 for severity) and that there is significant genetic correlation between the severities of both traits (rspearman=0.40). Unexpectedly, their spatio-temporal dynamics followed almost opposite patterns. While no significant Provenance effect were detected for any trait, significant Family effects were found for both CD and CL. Moreover, the analysis strategy implemented here allowed to compute Individual Breeding Values (IBV) and to show that there is more genetic variability within families than between families. In agreement with previous reports, early flushing correlates with better crown status. Consequences of these results in terms of management and breeding are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Background: Mixed dispersal syndromes have historically been regarded as bet-hedging mechanisms that enhance survival in unpredictable environments, ensuring that some propagules stay in the maternal environment while others can potentially colonize new sites. However, this entails paying the costs of both dispersal and non-dispersal. Propagules that disperse are likely to encounter unfavorable conditions for establishment, while non-dispersing propagules might form populations of close relatives burdened with inbreeding. Here, we investigate the conditions under which mixed dispersal syndromes emerge and are evolutionarily stable, taking into account the risks of both environmental unpredictability and inbreeding.\\n\\nResults: Using mathematical and computational modeling we show that high dispersal propensity is favored whenever temporal environmental unpredictability is low and inbreeding depression high, whereas mixed dispersal syndromes are adaptive under conditions of high environmental unpredictability, but more particularly if also inbreeding depression is small. Although pure dispersers can be selected for under some circumstances, mixed dispersal provides the optimal strategy under most parameterizations of our models, indicating that this strategy is likely to be favored under a wide variety of conditions. Furthermore, populations exhibiting any single phenotype go inevitably extinct when environmental and genetic costs are high, whilst mixed strategies can maintain viable populations even under such conditions.\\n\\nConclusions: Our models support the hypothesis that the interplay between inbreeding depression and environmental unpredictability shapes dispersal syndromes, often resulting in mixed strategies. Moreover, mixed dispersal seems to facilitate persistence whenever conditions are critical or nearly critical for survival.",

    "abstract": "The prediction of future childs sex is a question of keen public interest. The probability of having a child of either sex is close to 50%, although multiple factors may slightly change this value. Some demographic studies suggested that sex determination can be influenced by previous pregnancies, although this hypothesis was not commonly accepted. This paper explores the correlations between siblings sexes using data from the Demographic and Health Survey program. In the sample of about 2,214,601 women (7,985,855 children), the frequencies of sibships with multiple siblings of the same sex were significantly higher than can be expected by chance. A formal modelling demonstrated that sexes of the children were dependent on three kinds of sex ratio variation: a variation between families (Lexian), a variation within a family (Poisson) and a variation contingent upon the sex of preceding sibling (Markovian). There was a positive correlation between the sexes of successive siblings (coefficient = 0.067, p < 0.001), i.e. a child was more likely to be of the same sex as its preceding sibling. This correlation could be caused by secondary sex ratio adjustment in utero since the effect was decreasing with the length of birth-to-birth interval, and the birth-to-birth interval was longer for siblings with unlike sex.",

    "abstract": "The assembly of the first centrosome occurs upon fertilisation when the male centrioles recruit pericentriolar material (PCM) from the egg cytoplasm. While inaccuracy in the assembly of centrosomes leads to infertility and abnormal embryogenesis, the mechanism that ensures accurate assembly in vertebrate embryos remains obscure. Here we applied a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene knockout to show that Wdr8, a novel centrosomal protein, is maternally essential for PCM assembly during embryonic mitoses of medaka (Oryzias latipes). Maternal/zygotic Wdr8-null (Wdr8-/-) blastomeres exhibit severe defects in PCM assembly that cause them to divide asymmetrically and develop multipolar mitotic spindles and aneuploidy. We demonstrate that Wdr8 interacts via its WD40 domains with the centriolar satellite protein SSX2IP. Strikingly, exogenously provided Wdr8 fully rescues Wdr8-/- embryos to adulthood, except in variants with mutations in the WD40 domains. This combination of targeted gene inactivation and in vivo reconstitution of the maternally essential Wdr8-SSX2IP complex reveals an essential link between maternal PCM and the stability of the zygotic genome in the early vertebrate embryo.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection may often favor coordination between different traits, or phenotypic integration, in order to most efficiently acquire and deploy scarce resources. As leaves are the primary photosynthetic organ in plants, many have proposed that leaf physiology, biochemistry, and anatomical structure are coordinated along a functional trait spectrum from fast, resource-acquisitive syndromes to slow, resource-conservative syndromes. However, the coordination hypothesis has rarely been tested at a phylogenetic scale most relevant for understanding rapid adaptation in the recent past or predicting evolutionary trajectories in response to climate change. To that end, we used a common garden to examine genetically-based coordination between leaf traits across 19 wild and cultivated tomato taxa. We found surprisingly weak integration between photosynthetic rate, leaf structure, biochemical capacity, and CO2 diffusion, even though all were arrayed in the predicted direction along a  fast-slow spectrum. This suggests considerable scope for unique trait combinations to evolve in response to new environments or in crop breeding. In particular, we find that partially independent variation in stomatal and mesophyll conductance may allow a plant to improve water-use efficiency without necessarily sacrificing maximum photosynthetic rates. Our study does not imply that functional trait spectra or tradeoffs are unimportant, but that the many important axes of variation within a taxonomic group may be unique and not generalizable to other taxa.",

    "abstract": "The last 20 years of advancement in DNA sequencing technologies have led to the sequencing of thousands of microbial genomes, creating mountains of genetic data. While our efficiency in generating the data improves almost daily, applying meaningful relationships between the taxonomic and genetic entities requires a new approach. Currently, the knowledge is distributed across a fragmented landscape of resources from government-funded institutions such as NCBI and Uniprot to topic-focused databases like the ODB3 database of prokaryotic operons, to the supplemental table of a primary publication. A major drawback to large scale, expert curated databases is the expense of maintaining and extending them over time. No entity apart from a major institution with stable long-term funding can consider this, and their scope is limited considering the magnitude of microbial data being generated daily. Wikidata is an, openly editable, semantic web compatible framework for knowledge representation. Its a project of the Wikimedia Foundation and offers knowledge integration capabilities ideally suited to the challenge of representing the exploding body of information about microbial genomics. We are developing a microbial specific data model, based on Wikidatas semantic web compatibility, that represents bacterial species, strains and the gene and gene products that define them. Currently, we have loaded 1736 gene items and 1741 protein items for two strains of the human pathogenic bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis and used this subset of data as an example of the empowering utility of this model. In our next phase of development we will expand by adding another 118 bacterial genomes and their gene and gene products, totaling over ~900,000 additional entities. This aggregation of knowledge will be a platform for community-driven collaboration, allowing the networking of microbial genetic data through the sharing of knowledge by both the data and domain expert.",

    "abstract": "Light is an essential resource for photosynthesis. Limitation of light by shade from plant neighbors can induce a light competition program known as the shade avoidance response (SAR), thereby altering plant growth and development for the sake of survival. Natural genetic variation in SAR is found in plants adapted to distinct environments, including domesticated tomato Solanum lycopersicum and its wild relative Solanum pennellii. QTL mapping was used to examine variation of the SAR between these two species. We found organ specific responses in the elongation of the stem and petiole, including developmental acceleration of growth. Through RNAseq analysis we identified a number of ILs with reduced expression of auxin-related genes in shade treatment. These same ILs display a shade tolerant phenotype in stem growth and overall height. We also identified ILs with altered SAR expression of cell wall expansion genes, although these genotypes had no accompanying alteration in phenotype. Examination of weighted gene co-expression Connectivity networks in sun- and shade-treated plants revealed Connectivity changes in auxin and light signaling genes; this result was supported by the Identification of motifs within the promoters of a subset of shade-responsive genes that were enriched in light signaling, developmental pathways, and auxin responsive transcriptional domains. The Identification ofboth systemic and organ-specific shade tolerance in the ILs, as well as associated changes in the transcriptome, has the potential to inform future studies for breeding plants able to be grown closely (while neighbor-shaded), yet still maintaining high yield.\\n\\nSummaryGrowth plasticity in response to shade involves expression of specific auxin signaling and cell wall expansion genes, and shade avoidance QTL affect both stem elongation and developmental rate.",
