    "abstract": "Advances in whole genome sequencing (WGS) platforms and DNA library preparation have led to the development of methods for high throughput sequencing of bacterial genomes at a relatively low cost (Loman et al. 2012; Medini et al. 2008). WGS offers unprecedented resolution for determining degrees of relatedness between strains of bacterial pathogens and has proven a powerful tool for microbial population studies and epidemiological investigations (Harris et al. 2010; Lienau et al. 2011; Holt et al. 2009; Ashton, Peters, et al. 2015). The potential utility of WGS to public health microbiology has been highlighted previously (Koser et al. 2012; Kwong et al. 2013; Reuter et al. 2013; Joensen et al. 2014; Nair et al. 2014; Bakker et al. 2014; DAuria et al. 2014). Here we report, for the first time, the routine use of WGS as the primary test for identification, surveillance and outbreak investigation by a national reference laboratory. We present data on how this has revolutionised public health microbiology for one of the most common bacterial pathogens in the United Kingdom, the Salmonellae.\\n\\nDATA SUMMARY1. PHE Salmonella sequencing data is deposited in the Sequence Read Archive in BioProject PRJNA248792.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTThe first human genome cost around $3 billion, and took around 10 years to complete. Advances in DNA sequencing technology (also referred to as whole genome sequencing (WGS)) allow the same feat to be accomplished today for less than $10000 and less than 2 weeks. This remarkable improvement in technology has also led to a step change in microbiology, increasing our understanding of the evolution of major human pathogens such as Yersinia pestis, Salmonella Typhi and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. While these kinds of academic studies provide unparalleled context for public health action, until now, this approach has not been routinely employed at the frontline. At Public Health England, WGS has been implemented for routine public health identification, characterisation and typing of an important human pathogen, Salmonella, replacing methods that have changed little over the last 100 years. Analysis of WGS data has identified outbreaks that were previously undetectable and been used to infer rare antimicrobial resistance patterns. This paper will serve as a notification to the community of the methods PHE are using, and will be of great use to other public health labs considering switching to WGS.",

    "abstract": "In the context of a master level programming practical at the computer science department of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, we developed and make available two independent and highly optimized open-source implementations for the pair-wise statistical alignment model, also known as TKF91, that was developed by Thorne, Kishino, and Felsenstein in 1991. This paper has two parts. In the educational part, we cover teaching issues regarding the setup of the course and the practical and summarize student and teacher experiences. In the scientific part, the two student teams (Team I: Nikolai, Sebastian, Daniel; Team II: Sarah, Pierre) present their solutions for implementing efficient and numerically stable implementations of the TKF91 algorithm. The two teams worked independently on implementing the same algorithm. Hence, since the implementations yield identical results --with slight numerical deviations-- we are confident that the implementations are correct. We describe the optimizations applied and make them available as open-source codes in the hope that our findings and software will be useful to the community as well as for similar programming practicals at other universities.",

    "abstract": "The rate at which genomes adapt to environmental changes and the prevalence of adaptive processes in molecular evolution are two controversial issues in current evolutionary genetics. Previous attempts to quantify the genome-wide rate of adaptation through amino-acid substitution have revealed a surprising diversity of patterns, with some species (e.g. Drosophila) experiencing a very high adaptive rate, while other (e.g. humans) are dominated by nearly-neutral processes. It has been suggested that this discrepancy reflects between-species differences in effective population size. Published studies, however, were mainly focused on model organisms, and relied on disparate data sets and methodologies, so that an overview of the prevalence of adaptive protein evolution in nature is currently lacking. Here we extend existing estimators of the amino-acid adaptive rate by explicitly modelling the effect of favourable mutations on non-synonymous polymorphism patterns, and we apply these methods to a newly-built, homogeneous data set of 44 non-model animal species pairs. Data analysis uncovers a major contribution of adaptive evolution to the amino-acid substitution process across all major metazoan phyla - with the notable exception of humans and primates. The proportion of adaptive amino-acid substitution is found to be positively correlated to species effective population size. This relationship, however, appears to be primarily driven by a decreased rate of nearly-neutral amino-acid substitution due to more efficient purifying selection in large populations. Our results reveal that adaptive processes dominate the evolution of proteins in most animal species, but do not corroborate the hypothesis that adaptive substitutions accumulate at a faster rate in large populations. Implications regarding the factors influencing the rate of adaptive evolution and positive selection detection in humans vs. other organisms are discussed.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe rate at which species adapt to environmental changes is a controversial topic. The theory predicts that adaptation is easier in large than in small populations, and the genomic studies of model organisms have revealed a much higher adaptive rate in large population-sized flies than in small population-sized humans and apes. Here we build and analyse a large data set of protein-coding sequences made of thousands of genes in 44 pairs of species from various groups of animals including insects, molluscs, annelids, echinoderms, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Extending and improving existing data analysis methods, we show that adaptation is a major process in protein evolution across all phyla of animals: the proportion of amino-acid substitutions that occurred adaptively is above 50% in a majority of species, and reaches up to 90%. Our analysis does not confirm that population size, here approached through species genetic diversity and ecological traits, does influence the rate of adaptive molecular evolution, but points to human and apes as a special case, compared to other animals, in terms of adaptive genomic processes.",

    "abstract": "We made use of two recent, large-scale Drosophila GAL4 libraries and associated confocal imaging datasets to automatically segment large brain regions into smaller putative functional units such as neuropils and fiber tracts. The method we developed is based on the hypothesis that molecular identity can be used to assign individual voxels to biologically meaningful regions. Our results (available at https://strawlab.org/braincode) are consistent with this hypothesis because regions with well-known anatomy, namely the antennal lobes and central complex, were automatically segmented into familiar compartments. We then applied the algorithm to the central brain regions receiving input from the optic lobes. Based on the automated segmentation and manual validation, we can identify and provide promising driver lines for 10 previously identified and 14 novel types of visual projection neurons and their associated optic glomeruli. The same strategy can be used in other brain regions and likely other species, including vertebrates.",
