    "abstract": "We apply the statistical framework for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to eigenvector decomposition (EigenGWAS), which is commonly used in population genetics to characterise the structure of genetic data. The approach does not require discrete sub-populations and thus it can be utilized in any genetic data where the underlying population structure is unknown, or where the interest is assessing divergence along a gradient. Through theory and simulation study we show that our approach can identify regions under selection along gradients of ancestry. In real data, we confirm this by demonstrating LCT to be under selection between HapMap CEU-TSI cohorts, and validated this selection signal across European countries in the POPRES samples. HERC2 was also found to be differentiated between both the CEU-TSI cohort and within the POPRES sample, reflecting the likely anthropological differences in skin and hair colour between northern and southern European populations. Controlling for population stratification is of great importance in any quantitative genetic study and our approach also provides a simple, fast, and accurate way of predicting principal components in independent samples. With ever increasing sample sizes across many fields, this approach is likely to be greatly utilized to gain individual-level eigenvectors avoiding the computational challenges associated with conducting singular value decomposition in large datasets. We have developed freely available software to facilitate the application of the methods.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFor quantitative cancer models to be meaningful and interpretable the number of unknown parameters must be kept minimal. Experimental data can be utilized to calibrate model dynamics rates or rate constants. Proper integration of experimental data, however, depends on the chosen theoretical framework. Using live imaging of cell proliferation as an example, we show how to derive cell cycle distributions in agent-based models and averaged proliferation rates in differential equation models. We focus on a tumor hierarchy of cancer stem and progenitor non-stem cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMulti-scale agent-based models are increasingly used to simulate tumor growth dynamics. Simulating such complex systems is often a great challenge despite large computational power of modern computers and, thus, implementation techniques are becoming as important as the models themselves. Here we show, using a simple agent-based model of tumor growth, how the computational time required for simulation can be decreased by using vectorization techniques. In numerical examples we observed up to 30-fold increases in computation performance when standard approaches were, at least in part, replaced with vectorized routines in MATLAB.",

    "abstract": "Cell fate determination by lateral inhibition via Notch/Delta signalling has been extensively studied. Most formalised models consider Notch/Delta interactions in fields of cells, with parameters that typically lead to symmetry breaking of signalling states between neighbouring cells, commonly resulting in salt-and-pepper fate patterns. Here we consider the case of signalling between isolated cell pairs, and find that the bifurcation properties of a standard mathematical model of lateral inhibition can lead to stable symmetric signalling states. We apply this model to the adult intestinal stem cell (ISC) of Drosophila, whose fate is stochastic but dependent on the Notch/Delta pathway. We observe a correlation between signalling state in cell pairs and their contact area. We interpret this behaviour in terms of the properties of our model in the presence of population variability in signalling thresholds. Our results suggest that the dynamics of Notch/Delta signalling can contribute to explain stochasticity in stem cell fate decisions, and that the standard model for lateral inhibition can account for a wider range of developmental outcomes than previously considered.\\n\\nSummary statementNotch/Delta-mediated lateral inhibition in cell pairs can result in symmetric signalling depending on the activation threshold, which can modulate cell-fate decisions depending on contact area.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the finding of 8,000 year old wheat DNA from submerged marine sediments (1) was challenged on the basis of a lack of signal of cytosine deamination relative to three other data sets generated from young samples of herbarium and museum specimens, and a 7,000 year old human skeleton preserved in a cave environment (2). The study used a new approach for low coverage data sets to which tools such as mapDamage cannot be applied to infer chemical damage patterns. Here we show from the analysis of 148 palaeogenomic data sets that the rate of cytosine deamination is a thermally correlated process, and that organellar generally shows higher rates of deamination than nuclear DNA in comparable environments. We categorize four clusters of deamination rates (,{beta},{gamma},{varepsilon}) that are associated with cold stable environments, cool but thermally fluctuating environments, and progressively warmer environments. These correlations show that the expected level of deamination in the sedaDNA would be extremely low. The low coverage approach to detect DNA damage by Weiss et al. (2) fails to identify damage samples from the cold class of deamination rates. Finally, different enzymes used in library preparation processes exhibit varying capability in reporting cytosine deamination damage in the 5 region of fragments. The PCR enzyme used in the sedaDNA study would not have had the capability to report 5 cytosine deamination, as they do not read over uracil residues, and signatures of damage would have better been sought at the 3 end. The 8,000 year old sedaDNA matches both the thermal age prediction of fragmentation, and the expected level of cytosine deamination for the preservation environment. Given these facts and the use of rigorous controls these data meet the criteria of authentic ancient DNA to an extremely stringent level.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundScaffolding is a crucial step in the genome assembly process. Current methods based on large fragment paired-end reads or long reads allow an increase in continuity but often lack consistency in repetitive regions, resulting in fragmented assemblies. Here, we describe a novel tool to link assemblies to a genome map to aid complex genome reconstruction by detecting assembly errors and allowing scaffold ordering and anchoring.\\n\\nResultsWe present MaGuS (map-guided scaffolding), a modular tool that uses a draft genome assembly, a genome map, and high-throughput paired-end sequencing data to estimate the quality and to enhance the continuity of an assembly. We generated several assemblies of the Arabidopsis genome using different scaffolding programs and applied MaGuS to select the best assembly using quality metrics. Then, we used MaGuS to perform map-guided scaffolding to increase continuity by creating new scaffold links in low-covered and highly repetitive regions where other commonly used scaffolding methods lack consistency.\\n\\nConclusionsMaGuS is a powerful reference-free evaluator of assembly quality and a map-guided scaffolder that is freely available at https://github.com/institut-de-genomique/MaGuS. Its use can be extended to other high-throughput sequencing data (e.g., long-read data) and also to other map data (e.g., genetic maps) to improve the quality and the continuity of large and complex genome assemblies.",

    "abstract": "In the context of climate change and species invasions, range shifts increasingly gain attention because the rates at which they occur in the Anthropocene induce fast shifts in biological assemblages. During such range shifts, species experience multiple selection pressures. Especially for poleward expansions, a straightforward interpretation of the observed evolutionary dynamics is hampered because of the joint action of evolutionary processes related to spatial selection and to adaptation towards local climatic conditions. To disentangle the effects of these two processes, we integrated stochastic modeling and empirical approaches, using the spider mite Tetranychus urticae as a model species. We demonstrate considerable latitudinal quantitative genetic divergence in life-history traits in T. urticae, that was shaped by both spatial selection and local adaptation. The former mainly affected dispersal behavior, while development was mainly shaped by adaptation to the local climate. Divergence in life-history traits in species shifting their range poleward can consequently be jointly determined by fast local adaptation to the environmental gradient and contemporary evolutionary dynamics resulting from spatial selection. The integration of modeling with common garden experiments provides a powerful tool to study the contribution of these two evolutionary processes on life-history evolution during range expansion.",
