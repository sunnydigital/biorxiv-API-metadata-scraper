    "abstract": "Changes in gene expression are thought to regulate the differentiation process intrinsically through complex epigenetic mechanisms. In fundamental terms, however, this assumed regulation refers only to the intricate propagation of changes in gene expression or else leads to logical inconsistencies. The evolution and self-regulatory dynamics of individuated multicellularity also lack a unified and falsifiable description. To fill this gap, I computationally analyzed publicly available high-throughput data of histone H3 post-translational modifications and mRNA abundance for different Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Drosophila melanogaster cell-type/developmental-periods samples. My analysis of genomic regions adjacent to transcription start sites generated a profile from pairwise partial correlations between histone modifications controlling for the respective mRNA levels for each cell-type/developmental-period dataset. I found that these profiles, while explicitly uncorrelated to transcript abundance by construction, associate strongly with cell differentiation states. This association is not expected if cell differentiation is, in effect, regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Based on these results, I propose a falsifiable theory of individuated multicellularity, which relies on the synergistic coupling across the extracellular space of two stochastically independent \\\"self-organizing\\\" systems constraining histone modification states at the same sites. This theory describes how the multicellular individual--understood as an intrinsic, higher-order constraint--emerges from proliferating undifferentiated cells, and may explain the intrinsic regulation of gene transcriptional changes during cell differentiation and the evolution of individuated multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research is routinely criticized for being statistically underpowered due to characteristically small sample sizes and much larger sample sizes are being increasingly recommended. Additionally, various sources of artifact inherent in fMRI data can have detrimental impact on effect size estimates and statistical power. Here we show how specific removal of non-BOLD artifacts can improve effect size estimation and statistical power in task-fMRI contexts, with particular application to the social-cognitive domain of mentalizing/theory of mind. Non-BOLD variability identification and removal is achieved in a biophysical and statistically principled manner by combining multi-echo fMRI acquisition and independent components analysis (ME-ICA). Group-level effect size estimates on two different mentalizing tasks were enhanced by ME-ICA at a median rate of 24% in regions canonically associated with mentalizing, while much more substantial boosts (40-149%) were observed in non-canonical cerebellar areas. This effect size boosting is primarily a consequence of reduction of non-BOLD noise at the subject-level, which then translates into consequent reductions in between-subject variance at the group-level. Power simulations demonstrate that enhanced effect size enables highly-powered studies at traditional sample sizes. Cerebellar effects observed after applying ME-ICA may be unobservable with conventional imaging at traditional sample sizes. Thus, ME-ICA allows for principled design-agnostic non-BOLD artifact removal that can substantially improve effect size estimates and statistical power in task-fMRI contexts. ME-ICA could help issues regarding statistical power and non-BOLD noise and enable potential for novel discovery of aspects of brain organization that are currently under-appreciated and not well understood.",

    "abstract": "High quality Altai Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes are revealing which regions of archaic hominin DNA have persisted in the modern human genome. A number of these regions are associated with response to infection and immunity, with a suggestion that derived Neanderthal alleles found in modern Europeans and East Asians may be associated with autoimmunity. Independent sources of DNA-based evidence allow a re-evaluation of the nature and timing of the first epidemiologic transition. By combining skeletal, archaeological and genetic evidence we question whether the first epidemiologic transition in Eurasia was as tightly tied to the onset of the Holocene as has previously been assumed. There clear evidence to suggest that this transition began before the appearance of agriculture and occurred over a timescale of tens of thousands of years. The transfer of pathogens between human species may also have played a role in the extinction of the Neanderthals.",

    "abstract": "The problems with classical frequentist statistics have recently received much attention, yet the enthusiasm of researchers to adopt alternatives like Bayesian inference remains modest. Here I present the bootstrapped evidence test, an objective resampling procedure that takes the precision with which both the experimental and null hypothesis can be estimated into account. Simulations and reanalysis of actual experimental data demonstrate that this test minimizes false positives while maintaining sensitivity. It is equally applicable to a wide range of situations and thus minimizes problems arising from analytical flexibility. Critically, it does not dichotomize the results based on an arbitrary significance level but instead quantifies how well the data support either the alternative or the null hypothesis. It is thus particularly useful in situations with considerable uncertainty about the expected effect size. Because it is non-parametric, it is also robust to severe violations of assumptions made by classical statistics.",

    "abstract": "White-nose syndrome (WNS), a disease caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans1, has spread west from New York to Missouri and has killed more than six million bats2. In bat hibernacula where WNS is present, mass mortality has been observed and there is a high potential for population collapse or extinction of some species at a regional level. Although WNS is not yet present in the western U.S., the high diversity ofbat species3 and appropriate conditions for P. destructans in area caves may put these populations at risk. The absence of WNS in western caves provides a unique opportunity to ask questions about how bat species, geographic location, and habitat shape pre-WNS bat microbiota. The importance of microbiota is shown in many organisms, including amphibians, where individuals that survive a chytrid infection carry a higher prevalence of Janthinobacterium lividum4. The establishment of a pre-WNS baseline microbiota of western bats is critical to understanding how P. destructans may impact the native microbiota of the bats. Previous studies5,6 that identified the microbiota of bats have focused on gut and fecal microbiota, with little attention given to the external microbiota. Here we show for the first time that habitat and geography influence differences in the abundance and diversity of external bat microbiota. From our 202 (62 cave-netted, 140 surface-netted) bat samples belonging to 13 species of western bats uninfected with WNS, we identified differences in microbiota diversity among sites, and between cave-netted versus surface-netted bats, regardless of sex and species. These results present novel information about the factors that shape external microbiota of bats providing new insights into patterns of diversity in a pre-WNS bat population.",
