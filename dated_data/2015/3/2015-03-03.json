    "abstract": "In times of severe environmental changes and resulting shifts in the geographical distribution of animal and plant species it is crucial to unravel the mechanisms responsible for the dynamics of species ranges. Without such a mechanistic understanding reliable projections of future species distributions are difficult to derive. Species ranges may be highly dynamic and subject to  elastic behavior, i.e. a range contraction following a period of range expansion as a consequence of eco-evolutionary feedbacks due to (rapid) dispersal evolution. It has been proposed that this phenomenon occurs in habitat gradients, which are characterized by a negative cline in selection for dispersal from the range core towards the margin, as one may find with increasing patch isolation, for example. Using individual-based simulations we show in this study that the presence of Allee effects is a necessary condition for ranges to exhibit elastic behavior. A pronounced source/sink-structure at the range margin caused by Allee effects, leads to selection for decreased dispersal and subsequently to lowered colonization rates and increased local extinction risk. In addition, the nature of the gradient is crucial, as gradients which do not select for lower dispersal at the margin than in the core (patch size, growth rate, demographic stochasticity, extinction rate) did not lead to elastic range behavior.\\n\\nThus, we argue that range contractions are likely to occur after periods of expansion for species living in gradients of increasing patch isolation, which suffer from Allee effects.",

Some recent approaches depend on information theory. We show that considering shared entropy for pairs of loci can be misleading. The reason is that shared entropy does not imply epistasis for the pair. This observation holds true also in the absence of higher order epistasis. We discuss a refined approach for identifying pairwise interactions using entropy.",

    "abstract": "SummaryLarge resequencing projects require a significant amount of storage for raw sequences, as well as alignment files. Since the raw sequences are redundant once the alignment has been generated, it is possible to keep only the alignment files. We present BamHash, a checksum based method to ensure that the read pairs in FASTQ files match exactly the read pairs stored in BAM files, regardless of the ordering of reads. BamHash can be used to verify the integrity of the files stored and discover any discrepancies. Thus, BamHash can be used to determine if it is safe to delete the FASTQ files storing raw sequencing reads after alignment, without the loss of data.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationThe software is implemented in C++, GPL licensed and available at https://github.com/DecodeGenetics/BamHash\\n\\nContactpmelsted@hi.is",

    "abstract": "AbstractWe present a, mathematical model driven, framework to implement virtual or imaginary clinical trials (phase i trials) that can be used to bridge the gap between preclinical studies and the clinic. The trial implementation process includes the development of an experimentally validated mathematical model, generation of a cohort of heterogeneous virtual patients, an assessment of stratification factors, and optimization of treatment strategy. We show the detailed process through application to melanoma treatment, using a combination therapy of chemotherapy and an AKT inhibitor, which was recently tested in a phase 1 clinical trial. We developed a mathematical model, composed of ordinary differential equations, based on experimental data showing that such therapies differentially induce autophagy in melanoma cells. Model parameters were estimated using an optimization algorithm that minimizes differences between predicted cell populations and experimentally measured cell numbers. The calibrated model was validated by comparing predicted cell populations with experimentally measured melanoma cell populations in twelve different treatment scheduling conditions. By using this validated model as the foundation for a genetic algorithm, we generated a cohort of virtual patients that mimics the heterogeneous combination therapy responses observed in a companion clinical trial. Sensitivity analysis of this cohort defined parameters that discriminated virtual patients having more favorable versus less favorable outcomes. Finally, the model predicts optimal therapeutic approaches across all virtual patients.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryWe propose a computational framework to implement phase i trials (virtual/imaginary yet informed clinical trials) in cancer, using an experimentally calibrated mathematical model of melanoma combination therapy, that can readily capture observed heterogeneous clinical outcomes and be used to optimize future clinical trial design.",

    "abstract": "A novel crossmodal matching paradigm including vision, audition, and somatosensation was developed in order to investigate the interaction between attention and crossmodal congruence in multisensory integration. To that end, all three modalities were stimulated concurrently while a bimodal focus was defined blockwise. Congruence between stimulus intensity changes in the attended modalities had to be evaluated. We found that crossmodal congruence improved performance if both, the attended modalities and the task-irrelevant distractor were congruent. If the attended modalities were incongruent, the distractor impaired performance due to its congruence relation to one of the attended modalities. Between attentional conditions, magnitudes of crossmodal enhancement or impairment differed. Largest crossmodal effects were seen in visual-tactile matching, intermediate effects for audio-visual and smallest effects for audio-tactile matching. We conclude that differences in crossmodal matching likely reflect characteristics of multisensory neural network architecture. We discuss our results with respect to the timing of perceptual processing and state hypotheses for future physiological studies. Finally, etiological questions are addressed.",

    "abstract": "Recently, psychophysical laws have been observed to be functional in certain factors working downstream of the Wnt pathway. This work tests the veracity of the prevalence of such laws, albeit at a coarse level, using sensitivity analysis on biologically inspired epigenetically influenced computational causal models. In this work, the variation in the effect of the predictive behaviour of the transcription complex (TRCMPLX) conditional on the evidences of gene expressions in normal/tumor samples is observed by varying the initially assigned values of conditional probability tables (cpt) for TRCMPLX. Preliminary analysis shows that the variation in predictive behaviour of TRCMPLX follows power-logarithmic psychophysical law, crudely. More recently, wet lab experiments have proved the existence of sensors that behave in a logarithmic fashion thus supporting the earlier proposed postulates based on computational sensitivity analysis of this manuscript regarding the existence of logarithmic behaviour in the signaling pathways. It also signifies the importance of systems biology approach where in silico experiments combined with in vivo/in vitro experiments have the power to explore the deeper mechanisms of a signaling pathway. Additionally, it is hypothesized that these laws are prevalent at gene-gene interaction level also. The interactions were obtained by thresholding the inferred conditional probabilities of a gene activation given the status of another gene activation. The deviation in the interactions in normal/tumor samples was similarly observed by varying the initially assigned values of conditional probability tables (cpt) for TRCMPLX. Analysis of deviation in interactions show prevalence of psychophysical laws and is reported for interaction between elements of pairs (SFRP3, MYC), (SFRP2, CD44) and (DKK1, DACT2). Based on crude static models, it is assumed that dynamic models of Bayesian networks might reveal the phenomena in a better way.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is a key regulatory mechanism in mammalian genomes. Despite the increasing knowledge about this epigenetic modification, the understanding of human epigenome evolution is in its infancy. We used whole genome bisulfite sequencing to study DNA methylation and nucleotide divergence between human and great apes. We identified 360 and 210 differentially hypo- and hypermethylated regions (DMRs) in humans compared to non-human primates and estimated that 20% and 36% of these regions, respectively, were detectable throughout several human tissues. Human DMRs were enriched for specific histone modifications and contrary to expectations, the majority were located distal to transcription start sites, highlighting the importance of regions outside the direct regulatory context. We also found a significant excess of endogenous retrovirus elements in human-specific hypomethylated regions suggesting their association with local epigenetic changes.\\n\\nWe also reported for the first time a close interplay between inter-species genetic and epigenetic variation in regions of incomplete lineage sorting, transcription factor binding sites and human differentially hypermethylated regions. Specifically, we observed an excess of human-specific substitutions in transcription factor binding sites located within human DMRs, suggesting that alteration of regulatory motifs underlies some human-specific methylation patterns. We also found that the acquisition of DNA hypermethylation in the human lineage is frequently coupled with a rapid evolution at nucleotide level in the neighborhood of these CpG sites. Taken together, our results reveal new insights into the mechanistic basis of human-specific DNA methylation patterns and the interpretation of inter-species non-coding variation.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHuman and great apes, their closest living relatives, differ in numerous morphological and cognitive aspects, however their protein sequences are highly similar. It has long been hypothesized that human specific traits may be explained by changes in regulatory elements rather than by changes in primary sequence. In this context, evolutionary biologists have identified regulatory regions based on nucleotide sequence acceleration or conservation. However, epigenetics adds an extra layer of information that cannot be detected when comparing DNA sequences. The current study provides one of the first genome-wide comparison of genetic and epigenetic variation among humans and our closest living relatives. We identify and describe hundreds of regions presenting a human-specific DNA methylation pattern compared to great apes. We also report a local interplay between DNA methylation changes and the underlying nucleotide sequence in regions of incomplete lineage sorting and in regions of transcription factor binding, suggesting that both phenomena are closely associated.",
