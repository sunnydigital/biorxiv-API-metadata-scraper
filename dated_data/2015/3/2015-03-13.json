    "abstract": "Brief SummaryWhy do species ranges often end when no obvious change in the environment suggests they should? Our theory explains that there is an inherent limit to adaptation arising in any (finite) natural population, and identifies the key parameters that determine this limit to a species range. Two observable parameters describe the threshold when adaptation fails: i) the loss of fitness due to dispersal to a different environment, and ii) the efficacy of selection relative to stochastic effects in finite populations.\\n\\nAbstractWhy do species not adapt to ever-wider ranges of conditions, gradually expanding their ecological niche and geographic range? Gene flow across environments has two conflicting effects: while it increases genetic variation, which is a prerequisite for adaptation, gene flow may swamp adaptation to local conditions. In 1956, Haldane proposed that when the environment varies across space, \\\"swamping\\\" by gene flow creates a positive feedback between low population size and maladaptation, leading to a sharp range margin. Yet, current deterministic theory shows that when variance can evolve, there is no such limit. Using simple analytical tools and simulations, we show that genetic drift can generate a sharp margin to a species range, by reducing genetic variance below the level needed for adaptation to spatially variable conditions. Aided by separation of ecological and evolutionary time scales, the identified effective dimensionless parameters reveal a simple threshold that predicts when adaptation at the range margin fails. Two observable parameters determine the threshold: i) the effective environmental gradient, which can be measured by the loss of fitness due to dispersal to a different environment, and ii) the efficacy of selection relative to genetic drift. The theory predicts sharp range margins even in the absence of abrupt changes in the environment. Furthermore, it implies that gradual worsening of conditions across a species habitat may lead to a sudden range fragmentation, when adaptation to a wide span of conditions within a single species becomes impossible.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that is ubiquitous across many eukaryotes, with variable patterns and functions across taxa. The roles of DNA methylation during invertebrate development remain enigmatic, especially regarding the inheritance and ontogenetic dynamics of methylation. In order to better understand to what degree DNA methylation patterns are heritable, variable between individuals, and changing during Crassostrea gigas development, we characterized the genome-wide methylome of Crassostrea gigas sperm and larvae from two full-sib families nested within a maternal half-sib family across developmental stages.\\n\\nResultsBisulfite treated DNA sequencing of Crassostrea gigas sperm and larvae at 72 hours post fertilization and 120 hours post fertilization revealed DNA methylation ranges from 15-18%. Our data suggest that DNA methylation patterns are inherited, as methylation patterns were more similar between the two sires and their offspring compared to methylations pattern differences among developmental stages. Loci differing between the two paternal full-sib families (189) were found throughout the genome but were concentrated in transposable elements. The proportion of differentially methylated loci among developmental stages was not significantly greater in any genomic region.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study provides the first single-base pair resolution DNA methylomes for both oyster sperm and larval samples from multiple crosses. Assuming DNA methylation is introduced randomly, the predominance of differentially methylated loci between families within transposable elements could be associated with selection against altering methylation in gene bodies. For instance, differentially methylated loci in gene bodies could be lethal or deleterious, as they would alter gene expression. Another possibility is that differentially methylated loci may provide advantageous phenotypic variation by increasing transposable element mobility. Future research should focus on the relationship between epigenetic and genetic variation, and explore the possible relationship of DNA methylation and transposable element activity.",

    "abstract": "The inference of demographic history from genome data is hindered by a lack of efficient computational approaches. In particular, it has proven difficult to exploit the information contained in the distribution of genealogies across the genome. We have previously shown that the generating function (GF) of genealogies can be used to analytically compute likelihoods of demographic models from configurations of mutations in short sequence blocks (Lohse et al., 2011). Although the GF has a simple, recursive form, the size of such likelihood computations explodes quickly with the number of individuals and applications of this framework have so far been limited to small samples (pairs and triplets) for which the GF can be written down by hand. Here we investigate several strategies for exploiting the inherent symmetries of the coalescent. In particular, we show that the GF of genealogies can be decomposed into a set of equivalence classes which allows likelihood calculations from non-trivial samples. Using this strategy, we used Mathematica to automate block-wise likelihood calculations based on the GF for a very general set of demographic scenarios that may involve population size changes, continuous migration, discrete divergence and admixture between multiple populations. To give a concrete example, we calculate the likelihood for a model of isolation with migration (IM), assuming two diploid samples without phase and outgroup information, and compare the power of our approach to that of minimal pairwise samples. We demonstrate the new inference scheme with an analysis of two individual butterfly genomes from the sister species Heliconius melpomene rosina and Heliconius cyndo.",
