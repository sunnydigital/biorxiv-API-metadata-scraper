    "abstract": "The enormous size and complexity of genotypic sequence space frequently requires consideration of coarse-grained sequences in empirical models. We develop scaling relations to quantify the effect of this coarse-graining on properties of fitness landscapes and evolutionary paths. We first consider evolution on a simple Mount Fuji fitness landscape, focusing on how the length and predictability of evolutionary paths scale with the coarse-grained sequence length and number of alleles. We obtain simple scaling relations for both the weak- and strong-selection limits, with a non-trivial crossover regime at intermediate selection strengths. We apply these results to evolution on a biophysical fitness landscape designed to describe how proteins evolve new binding interactions while maintaining their folding stability. We combine numerical calculations for coarse-grained protein sequences with the scaling relations to obtain quantitative properties of the model for realistic binding interfaces and a full amino acid alphabet.",

    "abstract": "Sex-biased demography, in which parameters governing migration and population size differ between females and males, has been studied through comparisons of X chromosomes, which are inherited sex-specifically, and autosomes, which are not. A common form of sex bias in humans is sex-biased admixture, in which at least one of the source populations differs in its proportions of females and males contributing to an admixed population. Studies of sex-biased admixture often examine the mean ancestry for markers on the X chromosome in relation to the autosomes. A simple framework noting that in a population with equally many females and males, [Formula] of X chromosomes appear in females, suggests that the mean X-chromosomal admixture fraction is a linear combination of female and male admixture parameters, with coefficients [Formula] and [Formula], respectively. Extending a mechanistic admixture model to accommodate the X chromosome, we demonstrate that this prediction is not generally true in admixture models, though it holds in the limit for an admixture process occurring as a single event. For a model with constant ongoing admixture, we determine the mean X-chromosomal admixture, comparing admixture on female and male X chromosomes to corresponding autosomal values. Surprisingly, in reanalyzing African-American genetic data to estimate sex-specific contributions from African and European sources, we find that the range of contributions compatible with the excess African ancestry on the X chromosome compared to autosomes has a wide spread, permitting scenarios either without male-biased contributions from Europe or without female-biased contributions from Africa.",

    "abstract": "MotivationOwing to the complexity of the assembly problem, we do not yet have complete genome sequences. The difficulty in assembling reads into finished genomes is exacerbated by sequence repeats and the inability of short reads to capture sufficient genomic information to resolve those problematic regions. Established and emerging long read technologies show great promise in this regard, but their current associated higher error rates typically require computational base correction and/or additional bioinformatics preprocessing before they could be of value. We present LINKS, the Long Interval Nucleotide K-mer Scaffolder algorithm, a solution that makes use of the information in error-rich long reads, without the need for read alignment or base correction. We show how the contiguity of an ABySS E. coli K-12 genome assembly could be increased over five-fold by the use of beta-released Oxford Nanopore Ltd. (ONT) long reads and how LINKS leverages long-range information in S. cerevisiae W303 ONT reads to yield an assembly with less than half the errors of competing applications. Re-scaffolding the colossal white spruce assembly draft (PG29, 20 Gbp) and how LINKS scales to larger genomes is also presented. We expect LINKS to have broad utility in harnessing the potential of long reads in connecting high-quality sequences of small and large genome assembly drafts.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://www.bcgsc.ca/bioinformatics/software/links\\n\\nContactrwarren@bcgsc.ca",

    "abstract": "O_LIThere is a growing realization among community ecologists that interactions between species vary across space and time, and that this variation needs be quantified. Our current numerical framework to analyze the structure of species interactions, based on graph-theoretical approaches, usually do not consider the variability of interactions. Since this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of network structure so that they can exploit it.\\nC_LIO_LIWe present analytical expressions of key measures of network structured, adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological interactions. We do so by modeling each interaction as a Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its variance. When applied to non-probabilistic data, the measures we present give the same results as their non-probabilistic formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied.\\nC_LIO_LIWe present three case studies that highlight how these measures can be used, in re-analyzing data that experimentally measured the variability of interactions, to alleviate the computational demands of permutationbased approaches, and to use the frequency at which interactions are observed over several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We provide a free and open-source implementation of these measures.\\nC_LIO_LIWe discuss how both sampling and data representation of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.\\nC_LI",

While indirect evidence of adaptation can be detected in patterns of genetic variation in present-day people, ancient DNA makes it possible to witness selection directly by analyzing samples from populations before, during and after adaptation events. Here we report the first genome-wide scan for selection using ancient DNA, capitalizing on the largest genome-wide dataset yet assembled: 230 West Eurasians dating to between 6500 and 1000 BCE, including 163 with newly reported data. The new samples include the first genome-wide data from the Anatolian Neolithic culture, who we show were members of the population that was the source of Europes first farmers, and whose genetic material we extracted by focusing on the DNA-rich petrous bone. We identify genome-wide significant signatures of selection at loci associated with diet, pigmentation and immunity, and two independent episodes of selection on height.",

However, calculating these structures requires high performance computing clusters, a resource that may be limiting to many likely cryo-EM users. To address this limitation and facilitate the spread of cryo-EM, we developed a publicly available  off-the-shelf computing environment on Amazons elastic cloud computing infrastructure. This environment provides users with single particle cryo-EM software packages and the ability to create computing clusters that can range in size from 16 to 480+ CPUs. Importantly, these computing clusters are also cost-effective, as we illustrate here by determining a near-atomic resolution structure of the 80S yeast ribosome for $28.89 USD in ~10 hours.",

    "abstract": "Real-world time-continuous stimuli such as video promise greater naturalism for studies of brain function. However, modeling the stimulus variation is challenging and introduces a bias in favor of particular descriptive dimensions. Alternatively, we can look for brain regions whose signal is correlated between subjects, essentially using one subject to model another. Intersubject correlation mapping (ICM) allows us to find brain regions driven in a canonical manner across subjects by a complex natural stimulus. However, it requires a direct voxel-to-voxel match between the spatiotemporal activity patterns and is thus only sensitive to common activations sufficiently extended to match up in Talairach space (or in an alternative, e.g. cortical-surface-based, common brain space). Here we introduce the more general approach of intersubject information mapping (IIM). For each brain region, IIM determines how much information is shared between the subjects' local spatiotemporal activity patterns. We estimate the intersubject mutual information using canonical correlation analysis applied to voxels within a spherical searchlight centered on each voxel in turn. The intersubject information estimate is invariant to linear transforms including spatial rearrangement of the voxels within the searchlight. This invariance to local encoding will be crucial in exploring fine-grained brain representations, which cannot be matched up in a common space and, more fundamentally, might be unique to each individual - like fingerprints. IIM yields a continuous brain map, which reflects intersubject information in fine-grained patterns. Performed on data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of subjects viewing the same television show, IIM and ICM both highlighted sensory representations, including primary visual and auditory cortices. However, IIM revealed additional regions in higher association cortices, namely temporal pole and orbitofrontal cortex. These regions appear to encode the same information across subjects in their fine-grained patterns, although their spatial-average activation was not significantly correlated between subjects.",

    "abstract": "As the number of whole genomes available for study increases, so also does the opportunity to find unsuspected features hidden within our genetic code. One such feature allows for an estimate of the Human Mutation Rate in human chromosomes to be made. A NUMT is a small fragment of the mitochondrial DNA that enters the nucleus of a cell, gets captured by a chromosome and thereafter passed on from generation to generation. Over the millions of years of evolution, this unexpected phenomenon has happened many times. But it is usually very difficult to be able to say just when a NUMT might have been created. However, this paper presents evidence to show that for one particular NUMT the date of formation was around 29 million ago, which places the event in the Early Oligocene; when our ancestors were small monkey-like creatures. So now all of us carry this NUMT in each of our cells as do Old World Monkeys, the Great Apes and our nearest relations, the Chimpanzees. The estimate of the Human Mutation obtained by the method outlined here gives a value which is higher than has been generally found; but this new value perhaps only applies to non-coding regions of the Human genome where there is little, if any, selection pressure against new mutations.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of diversity can vary considerably from clade to clade. Attempts to understand these patterns often employ state-dependent speciation and extinction models to determine whether the evolution of a particular novel trait has increased speciation rates and/or decreased their extinction rates. It is still unclear, however, whether these models are uncovering important drivers of diversification, or whether they are simply pointing to more complex patterns involving many unmeasured and co-distributed factors. Here we describe an extension to the popular state-dependent speciation and extinction models that specifically accounts for the presence of unmeasured factors that could impact diversification rates estimated for the states of any observed trait, addressing at least one major criticism of BiSSE methods. Specifically, our model, which we refer to as HiSSE (Hidden-State Speciation and Extinction), assumes that related to each observed state in the model are \\\"hidden\\\" states that exhibit potentially distinct diversification dynamics and transition rates than the observed states in isolation. We also demonstrate how our model can be used as character-independent diversification (CID) models that allow for a complex diversification process that is independent of the evolution of a character. Under rigorous simulation tests and when applied to empirical data, we find that HiSSE performs reasonably well, and can at least detect net diversification rate differences between observed and hidden states and detect when diversification rate differences do not correlate with the observed states. We discuss the remaining issues with state-dependent speciation and extinction models in general, and the important ways in which HiSSE provides a more nuanced understanding of trait-dependent diversification.",

Past admixture leaves a population genomic signature of linkage disequilibrium (LD), reflecting the mixing of parental chromosomes by segregation and recombination. The extent of this LD can be used to infer the timing of admixture. However, the results of inference can depend strongly on the assumed demographic model. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework for modeling patterns of LD in a geographic contact zone where two differentiated populations are diffusing back together. We derive expressions for the expected LD and admixture tract lengths across geographic space as a function of the age of the contact zone and the dispersal distance of individuals. We develop an approach to infer age of contact zones using population genomic data from multiple spatially sampled populations by fitting our model to the decay of LD with recombination distance. We use our approach to explore the fit of a geographic contact zone model to three human population genomic datasets from populations along the Indonesian archipelago, populations in Central Asia and populations in India.",
