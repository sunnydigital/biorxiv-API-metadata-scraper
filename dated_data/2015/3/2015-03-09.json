    "abstract": "Reliability of scientific findings is always important, but even more so in ecosystem service science, where results can directly lead to policy implementations. The assessment of reliability resulted in the introduction of the evidence-based concept in the medical sciences. It aims at identifying the best available information to answer the question of interest. In environmental sciences, the evidence-based concept is well developed [very few people actually use it!] in conservation, but so far no guidelines exists for ecosystem services science. To apply the evidence-based concept in practice we need a scale to rank study designs commonly used in ecosystem services science as well as an assessment of the actual quality of implementation in a specific study. Here, we define a framework for evidence-based ecosystem service science, together with a design scale and a critical-appraisal checklist. The approach is described with detailed examples and specific suggestions for different user groups.",

    "abstract": "Coherent percepts emerge from the accurate combination of inputs from the different sensory systems. There is ongoing debate about the neurophysiological implementation of crossmodal interactions in the brain, and it has been proposed that transient synchronization of neurons might be of central importance. Specifically, oscillatory activity in lower frequency ranges (< 30 Hz) has been implicated in mediating long-range communication as typically studied in multisensory research. In the current study, we recorded high-density electroencephalograms (EEG) while human participants were engaged in a visual-tactile pattern matching paradigm. Employing the same physical stimulation, separate tasks of the experiment either required the detection of predefined targets in visual and tactile modalities or the explicit evaluation of crossmodal stimulus congruence. Analysis of the behavioral data showed benefits for congruent visual-tactile stimulus combinations. Differences in oscillatory dynamics within the two tasks related to crossmodal congruence involved effects in the theta-(2-7 Hz), alpha-(813 Hz) and beta-band (13-25 Hz). Contrasting neuronal activity between the two tasks revealed differences in pre-stimulus alpha- and beta-band power, as well as differences in post-stimulus theta-band activity. Source reconstruction for these effects showed prominent involvement of superior temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices - regions commonly implicated in multisensory integration. These results add to the increasing evidence that low frequency oscillations are well suited for studying integration in distributed brain networks, as demonstrated for crossmodal interactions in visual-tactile pattern matching in the current study. Additionally, neuronal activity at theta-, alpha- and beta-frequencies might subserve distinct processes relevant for multisensory integration, such as multisensory gating and crossmodal perceptual decision making.",

    "abstract": "During the last two decades ferrets (Mustela putorius) have been established as a highly efficient animal model in different fields in neuroscience. Here we asked whether ferrets integrate sensory information according to the same principles established for other species. Since only few methods and protocols are available for behaving ferrets we developed a head-free, body-restrained approach allowing a standardized stimulation position and the utilization of the ferrets natural response behavior. We established a behavioral paradigm to test audiovisual integration in the ferret. Animals had to detect a brief auditory and/or visual stimulus presented either left or right from their midline. We first determined detection thresholds for auditory amplitude and visual contrast. In a second step, we combined both modalities and compared psychometric fits and the reaction times between all conditions. We employed Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to model bimodal psychometric curves and to investigate whether ferrets integrate modalities in an optimal manner. Furthermore, to test for a redundant signal effect we pooled the reaction times of all animals to calculate a race model. We observed that bimodal detection thresholds were reduced and reaction times were faster in the bimodal compared to unimodal conditions. The race model and MLE modeling showed that ferrets integrate modalities in a statistically optimal fashion. Taken together, the data indicate that principles of multisensory integration previously demonstrated in other species also apply to crossmodal processing in the ferret.",

A unified structure/function model is proposed based on the common structural determinants shared by H/ACA and H/ACA-like motifs in both Euryarchaea and Crenarchaea. Using a computational approach, structural and energetic rules for the guide-target RNA-RNA interactions are derived from structural and functional data on the H/ACA RNP particles. H/ACA(-like) motifs found in Pyrococcus are evaluated through the classification and their biological relevance is discussed. Extra-ribosomal targets found in both Pyrococcus and Pyrobaculum are presented as testable gene candidates which might support the hypothesis of a gene regulation mediated by H/ACA(-like) guide RNAs.",

    "abstract": "The forebrain has the most complex shape and structure of the vertebrate brain regions and the mechanisms of its formation remain obscure. Convergence and extension movements are characteristic of the posterior (spinal cord and hindbrain) neural plate (pNP) while tissue deformations and underlying cellular dynamics during the early shaping of the forebrain neural plate (fNP) are undefined. Here, we apply live imaging, automated cell tracking and computational analysis to quantitatively map cell behaviour in the zebrafish fNP. We demonstrate a novel mechanism in which planar cell rearrangements, with a passive signature, are orthogonal to those in the pNP, and cell divisions lacking planar-polarity facilitate thickening from two to three layers. We develop a mechanical model of the fNP in which polarised cell behaviour arises from interactions with dissimilar bordering tissues rather than from intrinsically polarised cells. The model unifies in vivo observations and provides a mechanistic understanding of fNP morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Techniques for reconstructing geographical history along a phylogeny can answer many interesting question about the geographical origins of species. Bayesian models based on the assumption that taxa move through a diffusion process have found many applications. However, these methods rely on diffusion processes on a plane, and do not take the spherical nature of our planet in account. This makes it hard to perform analysis that cover the whole world, or do not take in account the distortions caused by projections like the Mercator projection.\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduce a Bayesian phylogeographical method based on diffusion on a sphere. When the area where taxa are sampled from is small, a sphere can be approximated by a plane and the model results in the same inferences as with models using diffusion on a plane. For taxa samples from the whole world, we obtain substantial differences. We present an efficient algorithm for performing inference in an Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, and show applications to small and large samples areas.\\n\\nAvailability: The method is implemented in the GEO_SPHERE package in BEAST 2, which is open source licensed under LGPL.",

    "abstract": "Premise of the StudyAutomatic self-fertilization may influence the geography of speciation, promote reproductive isolation between incipient species, and lead to ecological differentiation. As such, selfing taxa are predicted to co-occur more often with their closest relatives than are outcrossing taxa. Despite suggestions that this pattern may be general, the extent to which mating system influences range overlap in close relatives has not been tested formally across a diverse group of plant species pairs.\\n\\nMethodsWe test for a difference in range overlap between species pairs where zero, one, or both species are selfers, using data from 98 sister species pairs in 20 genera across 15 flowering plant families. We also use divergence time estimates from time-calibrated phylogenies to ask how range overlap changes with divergence time and whether this effect depends on mating system.\\n\\nKey ResultsWe find no evidence that automatic self-fertilization influences range overlap of closely related plant species. Sister pairs with more recent divergence times had modestly greater range overlap, but this effect did not depend on mating system.\\n\\nConclusionsThe absence of a strong influence of mating system on range overlap suggests that mating system plays a minor or inconsistent role compared to many other mechanisms potentially influencing the co-occurrence of close relatives.",
