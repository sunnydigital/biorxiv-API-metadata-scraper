    "abstract": "Type 1 paracaspases originated in the Ediacaran geological period before the last common ancestor of bilaterians and cnidarians (Planulozoa). Cnidarians have several paralog type 1 paracaspases, type 2 paracaspases, and a homolog of Bcl10. Notably in bilaterians, lineages like nematodes and insects lack Bcl10 whereas other lineages such as vertebrates, hemichordates, annelids and mollusks have a Bcl10 homolog. A survey of invertebrate CARD-coiled-coil (CC) domain homologs of CARMA/CARD9 revealed such homologs only in species with Bcl10, indicating an ancient co-evolution of the entire CARD-CC/Bcl10/MALT1-like paracaspase (CBM) complex. Furthermore, vertebrate-like Syk/Zap70 tyrosine kinase homologs with the ITAM-binding SH2 domain were found in invertebrate organisms with CARD-CC/Bcl10, indicating that this pathway might be the original user of the CBM complex. We also established that the downstream signaling proteins TRAF2 and TRAF6 are functionally conserved in Cnidaria. There also seems to be a correlation where invertebrates with CARD-CC and Bcl10 have type 1 paracaspases which are more similar to the paracaspases found in vertebrates. A proposed evolutionary scenario includes at least two ancestral type 1 paracaspase paralogs in the planulozoan last common ancestor, where at least one paralog usually is dependent on CARD-CC/Bcl10 for its function. Functional analyses of invertebrate type 1 paracaspases and Bcl10 homologs support this scenario and indicate an ancient origin of the CARD-CC/Bcl10/paracaspase signaling complex. Results from cnidarians, nematodes and mice also suggest an ancient neuronal role for the type 1 paracaspases.",

However, poor crop establishment frequently leads to either significant loss in yield, through below-target plant populations, weed competition, or crop failure. This study demonstrates that establishing the crop from transplants, common in the vegetable industry, is one way to achieve a uniform plant population and reduce weed competition through early establishment of canopy cover.

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity may evolve as a generalist strategy to cope with environmental heterogeneity. Empirical studies, however, rarely find results confirming this prediction. This may be related to constraints imposed by the genetic architecture underlying plasticity variation. Three components of plasticity are central to characterize its variation: the intensity of response, the direction of response and the total amount of change. Reaction norm functions are a key analytical tool in plasticity studies. The more complex they are, the more plasticity components will vary independently, requiring more parameters to be described. Experimental studies are continuously collecting results showing that actual reaction norms are often nonlinear. This demands an analytical framework - yet to be developed - capable of straightforwardly untangling plasticity components. In Drosophila mediopunctata, the number of dark spots on the abdomen decreases as a response to increasing developmental temperatures. We have previously described a strong association between reaction norm curvature and across-environment mean values in homozygous strains. Here, we describe seven new reaction norms of heterozygous genotypes and further the investigation on the genetic architecture of this traits plasticity, testing three competing models from the literature - Overdominance, Epistasis and Pleiotropy. We use the curves of localized slopes of each reaction norm - Local Plasticity functions - to characterize the plastic response intensity and direction, and introduce a Global Plasticity parameter to quantify their total amount of change. Uncoupling plasticity components allowed us to discard the Overdominance model, weaken the Epistasis model and strengthen the support for the Pleiotropy model. Furthermore, this approach allows the elaboration of a coherent developmental model for the pigmentation of D. mediopunctata where genetic variation at one single feature explains the patterns of plasticity and overall expression of the trait. We claim that Global Plasticity and Local Plasticity may prove instrumental to the understanding of adaptive reaction norm evolution",

    "abstract": "RNA molecules play vital biological roles, and understanding their structures gives us crucial insights into their biological functions. Model evaluation is a necessary step for better prediction and design of 3D RNA structures. Knowledge-based statistical potential has been proved to be a powerful approach for evaluating models of protein tertiary structures. In present, several knowledge-based potentials have also been proposed to assess models of RNA 3D structures. However, further amelioration is required to rank near-native structures and pick out the native structure from near-native structures, which is crucial in the prediction of RNA tertiary structures. In this work, we built a novel RNA knowledge-based potential-- PTRNAmark, which not only combines nucleotides mutual and self energies but also fully considers the specificity of every RNA. The benchmarks on different testing data sets all show that PTRNAmark are more efficient than existing evaluation methods in recognizing native state from a pool of near-native states of RNAs as well as in ranking near-native states of RNA models.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria often live in biofilms, which are microbial communities surrounded by a secreted extracellular matrix. Here, we demonstrate that hydrodynamic flow and matrix organization interact to shape competitive dynamics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Irrespective of initial frequency, in competition with matrix mutants, wild type cells always increase in relative abundance in straight-tunnel microfluidic devices under simple flow regimes. By contrast, in microenvironments with complex, irregular flow profiles - which are common in natural environments - wild type matrix-producing and isogenic non-producing strains can coexist. This result stems from local obstruction of flow by wild-type matrix producers, which generates regions of near-zero flow speed that allow matrix mutants to locally accumulate. Our findings connect the evolutionary stability of matrix production with the hydrodynamics and spatial structure of the surrounding environment, providing a potential explanation for the variation in biofilm matrix secretion observed among bacteria in natural environments.\\n\\nImpact StatementThe feedback between hydrodynamic flow conditions and biofilm spatial architecture drives competition in P. aeruginosa biofilms, and can explain the variation in biofilm production observed among bacteria in natural environments.",

A new application of single-cell whole-transcriptomics is the unbiased ordering of cells according to their progression along a dynamic process of interest. We introduce SCORPIUS, a method which can effectively reconstruct an ordering of individual cells without any prior information about the dynamic process. Comprehensive evaluation using ten scRNA-seq datasets shows that SCORPIUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. We used SCORPIUS to generate novel hypotheses regarding dendritic cell development, which were subsequently validated in vivo.

All existing architectures enable reading and writing, while some also allow for editing3 and elementary sequencing error correction3,4. However, none of the current architectures offers error-free and random-access readouts from a portable device. Here we show through experimental and theoretical verification that such a platform may be easily implemented in practice using MinION sequencers. The gist of the approach is to design an integrated pipeline that encodes data to avoid synthesis and sequencing errors, enables random access through addressing, and leverages efficient portable nanopore sequencing via new anchored iterative alignment and insertion/deletion error-correcting codes. Our work represents the only known random access DNA-based data storage system that uses error-prone MinION sequencers and produces error-free readouts with the highest reported information rate and density.",

    "abstract": "Loss of hand function after stroke is a major cause of long-term disability. Hand function can be partitioned into strength and independent control of fingers (individuation). Here we developed a novel paradigm, which independently quantifies these two aspects of hand function, to track hand recovery in 54 patients with hemiparesis over the first year after their stroke. Most recovery of both strength and individuation occurred in the first three months after stroke. Improvement in strength and individuation were tightly correlated up to a strength level of approximately 60% of the unaffected side. Beyond this threshold, further gains in strength were not accompanied by improvements in individuation. Any observed improvements in individuation beyond the 60% threshold were attributable instead to a second independent stable factor. Lesion analysis revealed that damage to the hand area in motor cortex and the corticospinal tract (CST) correlated more with individuation than with strength. CST involvement correlated with individuation even after factoring out the strength-individuation correlation. The most parsimonious explanation for these behavioral and lesion-based findings is that most strength recovery, along with some individuation, can be attributed to descending systems other than the CST, whereas further recovery of individuation is CST dependent.",

    "abstract": "Adaptations may require multiple mutations that are beneficial only in combination. To adapt, a lineage must acquire mutations that are individually neutral or deleterious before gaining the beneficial combination, thereby crossing a plateau or valley, respectively, in the mapping from genotype to fitness. Spatial population structure can facilitate plateau and valley crossing by allowing neutral and deleterious lineages to survive longer and produce more beneficial mutants. Here, we analyze adaptation across a two-mutation plateau or valley in an asexual population that is subdivided into discrete subpopulations, or demes, connected by migration. We describe how subdivision alters the dynamics of adaptation from those in an equally sized unstructured population and give a complete quantitative description of these dynamics for the island migration model. Subdivision can significantly decrease the waiting time for the adaptation if demes and migration rates are small enough that single-mutant lineages fix in one or more demes before producing the beneficial double mutant. But, the potential decrease is small in very large populations and may also be limited by the slow spread of the beneficial mutant in extremely subdivided populations. Subdivision has a smaller effect on the probability that the population adapts very quickly than on the mean time to adapt, which has important consequences in some applications, such as the development of cancer. Our results provide a general and intuitive framework for predicting the effects of spatial structure in other models and in natural populations.",

In the Drosophila embryo Toll is required to establish gene expression domains along the dorsal-ventral axis. Pathway activation induces degradation of the I{kappa}B inhibitor Cactus resulting in a nuclear gradient of the NF{kappa}B effector Dorsal. Here we investigate how cactus modulates Toll signals through its effects on the Dorsal gradient and Dorsal target genes. Quantitative analysis using a series of loss and gain-of-function conditions shows that the ventral and lateral aspects of the Dorsal gradient behave differently respective to Cactus fluctuations. Unexpectedly, Cactus favors Dorsal nuclear localization required as response to high Toll signals at the ventral side of the embryo. Furthermore, N-terminal deleted Cactus mimics these effects, indicating that the ability of Cactus to favor Toll stems from mobilization of a free Cactus pool induced by the Calpain A protease. These results indicate that unexplored mechanisms are at play to ensure a correct response to high Toll signals.\\n\\nSummaryThe I{kappa}B protein Cactus favors high Toll signals, revealing that the ventral and lateral aspects of the Dorsal/NF{kappa}B nuclear gradient behave differently respective to Cactus concentrations in the Drosophila embryo.",

    "abstract": "{beta}-amyloid accumulation and Tau aggregation are hallmarks of Alzheimers disease, yet their underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure, hindering therapeutic advances. Here we report that neuronal receptor PTP{sigma} mediates both {beta}-amyloid and Tau pathogenesis in two mouse models. In the brain, PTP{sigma} binds to {beta}-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Depletion of PTP{sigma} reduces the affinity between APP and {beta}-secretase, diminishing APP proteolytic products by {beta}- and {gamma}-cleavage without affecting other major substrates of the secretases, suggesting a specificity of {beta}-amyloidogenic regulation. In human APP transgenic mice during aging, the progression of {beta}-amyloidosis, Tau aggregation, neuroinflammation, synaptic loss, as well as behavioral deficits, all show unambiguous dependency on the expression of PTP{sigma}. Additionally, the aggregates of endogenous Tau are found in a distribution pattern similar to that of early stage neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer brains. Together, these findings unveil a gatekeeping role of PTP{sigma} upstream of the degenerative pathogenesis, indicating a potential for this neuronal receptor as a drug target for Alzheimers disease.",

Several methodological and review papers have indicated how and why candidate models should be compared by trading off their ability to predict the data as a function of their complexity. However, the importance of simulating candidate models has been so far largely overlooked, which entails several drawbacks and leads to invalid conclusions. Here we argue that the analysis of model simulations is often necessary to support the specific claims about behavioral function that most of model-based studies make. We defend this argument both informally by providing a large-scale (N>300) review of recent studies, and formally by showing how model simulations are necessary to interpret model comparison results. Finally, we propose guidelines for future work, which combine model comparison and simulation.",

Since interactions are crucial to the structure and functioning of ecological communities, we need to develop a better understanding of their spatial distribution. Here, we investigate whether species interactions vary more in response to different climate variables, than individual species do. Location: Eurasia. Time period: 2000s. Major taxa: Animalia. Methods: We used a measure of Local Contribution to Beta-Diversity to evaluate the compositional uniqueness of 51 host-parasite communities of rodents and their ectoparasitic fleas across Eurasia, using publicly available data. We measured uniqueness based on the species composition, and based on potential and realized biotic interactions (here, host-parasite interactions). Results: We show that species interactions vary more, across space, than species do. In particular, we show that species interactions respond to some climatic variables that have no effect on species distributions or dissimilarity. Main conclusions: Species interactions capture some degree of variation which is not apparent when looking at species occurrences only. In this system, this appeared as hosts and parasites interacting in different ways as a reponse to different environments, especially the temperature and dryness. We discuss the implications of this finding for the amount of information that should be considered when measuring community dissimilarity.",

    "abstract": "Engineering complex phenotypes for industrial and synthetic biology applications is difficult and often confounds rational design. Bioethanol production from lignocellulosic feedstocks is a complex trait that requires multiple host systems to utilize, detoxify, and metabolize a mixture of sugars and inhibitors present in plant hydrolysates. Here, we demonstrate an integrated approach to discovering and optimizing host factors that impact fitness of Saccharomyces cerevisiae during fermentation of a Miscanthus x giganteus plant hydrolysate. We first used high-resolution Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping and systematic Bulk Reciprocal Hemizygosity analysis (bRHA) to discover 17 loci that differentiate hydrolysate tolerance between an industrially related (JAY291) and a laboratory (S288C) strain. We then used this data to identify a subset of favorable allelic loci that were most amenable for strain engineering. Guided by this \\\"genetic blueprint\\\", and using a dual-guide Cas9-based method to efficiently perform multi-kilobase locus replacements, we engineered an S288C strain with superior hydrolysate tolerance than JAY291. Our methods should be generalizable to engineering any complex trait in S. cerevisiae, as well as other organisms.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the emotions of others through nonverbal cues is critical for successful social interactions. The right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS) is one brain region thought to be key in the recognition of the mental states of others based on body language and facial expression. In the present study, we temporarily disrupted functional activity of the rpSTS by using continuous, theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) to test the hypothesis that the rpSTS plays a causal role in emotion recognition from body movements. Participants (N=23) received cTBS of the rpSTS, which was individually localized using fMRI, and a vertex control site. Before and after cTBS, we tested the ability of participants to identify emotions from point-light biological motion stimuli and a non-biological global motion identification task. Results revealed that the ability of participants to accurately identify emotional states from biological motion was reduced following cTBS stimulation to the rpSTS, but was unimpaired following vertex stimulation. Accuracy on the global motion tasks was unaffected by cTBS to either site. These results support the causal role of the rpSTS in decoding information about others emotional state from their body movements and gestures.",

    "abstract": "The advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has revolutionized the way in which epigenetic research is conducted. Often coupled with the availability of fully sequenced genomes, millions of small RNA (sRNA) reads are mapped to regions of interest and the results scrutinized for clues about epigenetic mechanisms. However, this approach requires careful consideration in regards to experimental design, especially when one investigates repetitive parts of genomes such as transposable elements (TEs), and especially when such genomes are large as is often the case in plants. Here, to shed light on the challenges of mapping sRNAs to TEs, we focus on the 2,300Mb maize genome, of which >85% is derived from TEs. We compare various methodological strategies that are commonly employed in TE studies. These include choices for the reference dataset, the normalization of multiple mapping sRNAs, and the selection among different types of sRNA metrics. We further examine how these choices influence the relationship between sRNAs and the critical feature of TE age, and explore and contrast their effect on low copy regions (exons) and other popular HTS data (RNA-seq). Finally, based on our analysis, we share a series of take-home messages to help guide TE epigenetic studies specifically, but our conclusions may also apply to any work that involves mapping and analysis of HTS data.",

The elemental content is chemically stable, making the samples stored in germplasm repositories an intriguing source of experimental material. To test the efficacy of using samples from germplasm banks for gene discovery, we analyzed the elemental profile of seeds from 1653 lines in the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection. We observed large differences in the elemental profiles based on where the lines were grown, which lead us to break up the genetic analysis into multiple small experiments. Despite these challenges, we were able to identify candidate SNPs controlling elemental accumulation as well as lines with extreme elemental accumulation phenotypes. Our results suggest that elemental analysis of germplasm samples can identify SNPs in linkage disequilibrium to genes, which can be leveraged to assist in crop improvement efforts.",

    "abstract": "The twin arginine translocation (Tat) system is an integral membrane protein complex that accomplishes the remarkable feat of transporting large, fully-folded polypeptides across the inner membrane of bacteria, into the periplasm. In Escherichia coli Tat is comprised of three membrane proteins: TatA, TatB and TatC. How these proteins arrange themselves in the inner membrane to permit passage of Tat substrates, whilst maintaining membrane integrity, is still poorly understood. TatA is the most abundant component of this complex and facilitates assembly of the transport mechanism. We have utilised immunogold labelling in combination with array tomography to gain insight into the localisation and distribution of the TatA protein in E. coli cells. We show that TatA exhibits a uniform distribution throughout the inner membrane of E. coli and that altering the expression of TatBC shows a previously uncharacterised distribution of TatA in the inner membrane. Array tomography was used to provide our first insight into this altered distribution of TatA in 3D space, revealing that this protein forms linear clusters in the inner membrane of E. coli upon increased expression of TatBC. This is the first indication that TatA organisation in the inner membrane alters in response to changes in Tat subunit stoichiometry.\\n\\nSummary statementThe volumetric electron-microscopy technique, array tomography, revealed a novel distribution of TatA protein (from the twin arginine translocase complex), in Escherichia coli.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale cross-sectional and cohort studies have transformed our understanding of the genetic and environmental determinants of health outcomes. However, the representativeness of these samples may be limited - either through selection into studies, or by attrition from studies over time. Here we explore the potential impact of this selection bias on results obtained from these studies, from the perspective that this amounts to conditioning on a collider (i.e., a form of collider bias). While it is acknowledged that selection bias will have a strong effect on representativeness and prevalence estimates, it is often assumed that it should not have a strong impact on estimates of associations. We argue that because selection can induce collider bias (which occurs when two variables independently influence a third variable, and that third variable is conditioned upon), selection can lead to substantially biased estimates of associations. In particular, selection related to phenotypes can bias associations with genetic variants associated with those phenotypes. In simulations, we show that even modest influences on selection into, or attrition from, a study can generate biased and potentially misleading estimates of both phenotypic and genotypic associations. Our results highlight the value of knowing which population your study sample is representative of. If the factors influencing selection and attrition are known, they can be adjusted for. For example, having DNA available on most participants in a birth cohort study offers the possibility of investigating the extent to which polygenic scores predict subsequent participation, which in turn would enable sensitivity analyses of the extent to which bias might distort estimates.\\n\\nKey MessagesSelection bias (including selective attrition) may limit the representativeness of large-scale cross-sectional and cohort studies.\\n\\nThis selection bias may induce collider bias (which occurs when two variables independently influence a third variable, and that variable is conditioned upon).\\n\\nThis may lead to substantially biased estimates of associations, including of genetic associations, even when selection / attrition is relatively modest.",

To see whether similar phenomena could be observed in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, we challenged drug-naive nematodes with a chronic low (0.01 mM) and high (1 mM) nicotine concentration for 55 h (from hatching to adulthood). After that, we recorded changes in their behavior in a nicotine gradient, where they could choose a desired nicotine concentration. By using a combination of behavioral and morphometric methods, we found that both nicotine and food modulate worm behavior. In the presence of food the nematodes adapted to the low nicotine concentration, when placed in the gradient, chose a similar nicotine concentration like C. elegans adapted to the high nicotine concentration. However, in the absence of food, the nematodes adapted to the low nicotine concentration, when placed in the gradient of this alkaloid, chose a similar nicotine concentration like naive worms. The nematodes growing up in the presence of high concentrations of nicotine had a statistically smaller body size, compared to the control condition, and the presence of food did not cause any enhanced slowing movement. These results provide a platform for more detailed molecular and cellular studies of nicotine addiction and food intake in this model organism.",

    "abstract": "Protein structure prediction was for decades one of the grand unsolved challenges in bioinformatics. A few years ago it was shown that by using a maximum entropy approach to describe couplings between columns in a multiple sequence alignment it was possible to significantly increase the accuracy of residue contact predictions. For very large protein families with more than 1000 effective sequences the accuracy is sufficient to produce accurate models of proteins as well as complexes. Today, for about half of all Pfam domain families no structure is known, but unfortunately most of these families have at most a few hundred members, i.e. are too small for existing contact prediction methods. To extend accurate contact predictions to the thousands of smaller protein families we present PconsC3, an improved method for protein contact predictions that can be used for families with as little as 100 effective sequence members. We estimate that PconsC3 provides accurate contact predictions for up to 4646 Pfam domain families. In addition, PconsC3 outperforms previous methods significantly independent on family size, secondary structure content, contact range, or the number of selected contacts. This improvement translates into improved de-novo prediction of three-dimensional structures. PconsC3 is available as a web server and downloadable version at http://c3.pcons.net.

    "abstract": "Background : As an effort to reduce the incidence of boar taint, surgical castration is routinely performed on young male piglets. However, the practice of castration raises animal welfare concerns and is undesirable from a production point of view since the elimination of sex hormones reduces feed efficiency and growth. Androstenone is one of the major chemical compounds responsible for boar taint which is characterized by an unpleasant taste and smell from the meat. Primary objectives of this study were to discover new single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within androstenone associated QTL region reported earlier on SSC13 and then utilize a batch of these SNPs for testing the association between three proposed positional candidate genes- solute carrier family 22 (organic anion transporter), member 13 (SLC22A13) and solute carrier family 22 (organic anion transporter), member 14 (SLC22A14) and activin receptor type-2B precursor (ACVR2B) and fat androstenone levels in a population of 922 Norwegian Duroc pigs. Results : In this paper, we discovered several thousands of putative new single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within this QTL region using ~4.92 billion 100bp paired-end illumina whole genome re-sequencing reads of 23 Norwegian Duroc sires. A subset of these SNPs (n=83) in addition to 27 SNPs from the Porcine illumina SNP60 BeadChip were utilized for genotyping on 922 Norwegian Duroc offspring with androstenone records. Overall 66 new and 15 illumina genotyped SNPs were further used for testing associations with the levels of androstenone in fat tissue. The association study revealed that a total of 5 new SNPs and one illumina SNP of sodium channel, voltage-gated (SCN) genes was significantly affecting the levels of fat androstenone (p<0.05). Further analysis determined a significant (p<0.05) haplotype block of 23-SNP . Conclusions : Genotyped SNPs in three proposed candidate genes were not explaining any phenotypic variance for androstenone levels but 5 new SNPs and one illumina SNP within another cluster of SCN genes (SCN5A, SCN10A and SCN11A) were, however, significantly affecting levels of fat androstenone.",

    "abstract": "Promiscuity can drive the evolution of sexual conflict before and after mating occurs. Post-mating, the male ejaculate can selfishly manipulate female physiology leading to a chemical arms race between the sexes. Theory suggests that drift and sexually antagonistic coevolution can cause allopatric populations to evolve different chemical interactions between the sexes, thereby leading to postmating reproductive barriers and speciation. There is, however, little empirical evidence supporting this form of speciation. We tested this theory by creating an experimental evolutionary model of Drosophila melanogaster populations undergoing different levels of interlocus sexual conflict. We found that allopatric populations under elevated sexual conflict show assortative mating indicating premating reproductive isolation. Further, these allopatric populations also show reduced copulation duration and sperm defense ability when mating happens between individuals between individuals across populations compared to that within the same population, indicating postmating prezygotic isolation. Sexual conflict can cause reproductive isolation in allopatric populations through the coevolution of chemical (postmating prezygotic) as well as behavioural (premating) interaction between the sexes. Thus, to our knowledge, we provide the first comprehensive evidence of postmating (as well as premating) reproductive isolation due to sexual conflict.",

A previous study showed that wild and captive pandas were exposed to toxins in their diet of bamboo, but the ultimate origin of these toxins is unknown. Here we show that atmospheric deposition is the origin of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the diets of captive and wild Qinling giant pandas. Atmospheric deposition averaged 115 and 49 g*m-2*yr-1 at Chinas Shaanxi Wild Animal Research Center (SWARC) and Foping National Nature Reserve (FNNR), respectively. Atmospheric deposition of heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Pb, Hg, Co, Cu, Zn, Mn and Ni) and POPs at SWARC was higher than at FNNR. Soil concentrations of the aforementioned heavy metals other than As and Zn also were significantly higher at SWARC than at FNNR. We conclude that efforts to conserve the Qinling subspecies of panda may be compromised by air pollution attendant to Chinas economic development. Improvement of air quality and reductions of toxic emissions are urgently required to protect Chinas iconic species.",

In insects, desiccation tolerance varies predictably over various spatial and temporal scales and is an important physiological basis of fitness variation among natural populations. Here, we examine the dynamics of desiccation tolerance in North American populations of Drosophila melanogaster using: 1) natural populations sampled across latitudes and seasons in the eastern USA; 2) experimental evolution in the field in response to changing seasonal environments; 3) a sequenced panel of inbred lines (DGRP) to perform genome wide associations and examine whether SNPs/genes associated with variation in desiccation tolerance exhibit patterns of clinal and/or seasonal enrichment in pooled sequencing of populations. In natural populations we observed a shallow cline in desiccation tolerance, for which tolerance exhibited a positive association with latitude; the steepness of this cline increased with decreasing culture temperature, demonstrating a significant degree of thermal plasticity. No differences in desiccation tolerance were observed between spring and autumn collections from three mid-to-northern latitude populations, or as a function of experimental evolution to seasonality. Similarly, water loss rates did not vary significantly among latitudinal, seasonal or experimental evolution populations. However, changes in metabolic rates during prolonged exposure to dry conditions indicate increased tolerance in higher latitude populations. Genome wide association studies identified thirty-six SNPs in twenty-eight genes associated with sex-averaged drought tolerance. Among North American populations, genes associated with drought tolerance do not show increased signatures of spatially varying selection relative to the rest of the genome, whereas among Australian populations they do.",

    "abstract": "We present a web-based tool, Genetic Information Relationship Network (GIRN), for mapping genes to a global protein interaction network for humans, and for further annotating this map with gene ontology, pathway, disease, and user-generated terms. These annotations can be adjusted according to enrichment within a subset of genes. Additionally, drugs that interact with genes in the subset can be added to the graph. The maps are force-directed graphs in which highly connected nodes tend toward the center, and highly interconnected nodes tend toward each other. Icons of different shapes and colors are employed to indicate whether the node represents a protein, a gene, or one of the various types of annotation. Coordinated interaction of genes and functional inference can be identified by visual inspection. Each node in the graph is associated with a menu of links to external data sources. Collectively, these tools provide an efficient portal to gene-associated public data for any group of genes specified by the user. The site can be found at www.voxvill.org/relnet.",

    "abstract": "New technologies for manipulating and recording the nervous system allow us to perform unprecedented experiments. However, the influence of our experimental manipulations on psychological processes must be inferred from their effects on behavior. Today, quantifying behavior has become the bottleneck for large-scale, high-throughput, experiments. The method presented here addresses this issue by using deep learning algorithms for video-based animal tracking. Here we describe a reliable automatic method for tracking head position and orientation from simple video recordings of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). This method for measuring marmoset behavior allows for the estimation of gaze within foveal error, and can easily be adapted to a wide variety of similar tasks in biomedical research. In particular, the method has great potential for the simultaneous tracking of multiple marmosets to quantify social behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The primary protein of the bacterial Z ring guiding cell division, FtsZ, has recently been shown to engage in intriguing self-organization together with one of its natural membrane anchors, FtsA. When co-reconstituted on flat supported membranes, these proteins assemble into dynamic chiral vortices whose diameters resemble the cell circumference. These dynamics are due to treadmilling polar FtsZ filaments, supposedly destabilized by the co-polymerizing membrane adaptor FtsA, thus catalysing their turnover. Here we show that FtsA is in fact dispensable and that the phenomenon is an intrinsic property of FtsZ alone when supplemented with a membrane anchor. The emergence of these chiral dynamic patterns is critically dependent on GTP concentration and FtsZ surface densities, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The interplay of membrane tethering, GTP binding, and hydrolysis promotes both, the assembly and the destabilization of FtsZ polymers, leading to the observed treadmilling dynamics. Notably, the vortex chirality is defined by the position of the membrane targeting sequence (mts) and can be inverted when attaching it to the opposite end of FtsZ. This reveals a so far unknown vectorial character of these cytomotive filaments, comprising three orthogonal directions: Filament polarity, curvature, and membrane attachment.",

    "abstract": "The existence of Metabolic Gene Clusters (MGCs) in plant genomes has recently raised increased interest. Thus far, MGCs were commonly identified for pathways of specialized metabolism, mostly those associated with terpene type products. For efficient identification of novel MGCs computational approaches are essential. Here we present PhytoClust; a tool for the detection of candidate MGCs in plant genomes. The algorithm employs a collection of enzyme families related to plant specialized metabolism, translated into hidden Markov models, to mine given genome sequences for physically co-localized metabolic enzymes. Our tool accurately identifies previously characterized plant MBCs. An exhaustive search of 31 plant genomes detected 1232 and 5531 putative gene cluster types and candidates, respectively. Clustering analysis of putative MGCs types by species reflected plant taxonomy. Furthermore, enrichment analysis revealed taxa- and species-specific enrichment of certain enzyme families in MGCs. When operating through our web-interface, PhytoClust users can mine a genome either based on a list of known cluster types or by defining new cluster rules. Moreover, for selected plant species, the output can be complemented by co-expression analysis. Altogether, we envisage PhytoClust to enhance novel MGCs discovery which will in turn impact the exploration of plant metabolism.",
