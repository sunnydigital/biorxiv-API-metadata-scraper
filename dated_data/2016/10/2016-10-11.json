    "abstract": "Analysis of coupled variables is a core concept of cell biological inference, with co-localization of two molecules as a proxy for protein interaction being a ubiquitous example. However, external effectors may influence the observed co-localization independently from the local interaction of two proteins. Such global bias, although biologically meaningful, is often neglected when interpreting co-localization. Here, we describe DeBias, a computational method to quantify and decouple global bias from local interactions between variables by modeling the observed co-localization as the cumulative contribution of a global and a local component. We showcase four applications of DeBias in different areas of cell biology, and demonstrate that the global bias encapsulates fundamental mechanistic information of cellular behavior. The DeBias software package is freely accessible online via a web-server at https://debias.biohpc.swmed.edu.",

    "abstract": "Scalable, integrative methods to understand mechanisms that link genetic variants with phenotypes are needed. Here we derive a mathematical expression to compute PrediXcan (a gene mapping approach) results using summary data (S-PrediXcan) and show its accuracy and general robustness to misspecified reference sets. We apply this framework to 44 GTEx tissues and 100+ phenotypes from GWAS and meta-analysis studies, creating a growing public catalog of associations that seeks to capture the effects of gene expression variation on human phenotypes. Replication in an independent cohort is shown. Most of the associations were tissue specific, suggesting context specificity of the trait etiology. Colocalized significant associations in unexpected tissues underscore the need for an agnostic scanning of multiple contexts to improve our ability to detect causal regulatory mechanisms. Monogenic disease genes are enriched among significant associations for related traits, suggesting that smaller alterations of these genes may cause a spectrum of milder phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Transcript levels are a critical determinant of the proteome and hence cellular function. Because the transcriptome is an outcome of the interactions between genes and their products, it may be accurately represented by a subset of transcript abundances. We developed a method, Tradict (transcriptome predict), capable of learning and using the expression measurements of a small subset of 100 marker genes to predict transcriptome-wide gene abundances and the expression of a comprehensive, but interpretable list of transcriptional programs that represent the major biological processes and pathways of the cell. By analyzing over 23,000 publicly available RNA-Seq datasets, we show that Tradict is robust to noise and accurate. Coupled with targeted RNA sequencing, Tradict may therefore enable simultaneous transcriptome-wide screening and mechanistic investigation at large scales.",

    "abstract": "A central aim, from basic neuroscience to psychiatry, is to resolve how genes control brain circuitry and behavior. This is experimentally hard, since most brain functions and behaviors are controlled by multiple genes. In low throughput, one gene at a time, experiments, it is therefore difficult to delineate the neural circuitry through which these sets of genes express their behavioral effects. The increasing amount of publicly available brain and genetic data offers a rich source that could be mined to address this problem computationally. However, most computational approaches are not tailored to reflect functional synergies in brain circuitry accumulating within sets of genes. Here, we developed an algorithm that fuses gene expression and connectivity data with functional genetic meta data and exploits such cumulative effects to predict neuroanatomical maps for multigenic functions. These maps recapture known functional anatomical annotations from literature and functional MRI data. When applied to meta data from mouse QTLs and human neuropsychiatric databases, our method predicts functional maps underlying behavioral or psychiatric traits. We show that it is possible to predict functional neuroanatomy from mouse and human genetic meta data and provide a discovery tool for high throughput functional exploration of brain anatomy in silico.",

    "abstract": "Significance statementGenome-wide characterization of AGO4-dependent siRNAs revealed that AGO4 is required for the accumulation of a small subset of heterochromatic siRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana. These AGO4-depdenent siRNAs are likely secondary het-siRNAs produced by a self-reinforcing loop of RdDM. Slicing-defective AGO4 is unable to fully complement het-siRNA accumulation from an ago4 mutant, demonstrating the critical role of AGO4 catalytic ability in het-siRNA accumulation.\\n\\nSummary: 152; Introduction: 618; Results: 1291; Discussion: 1013; Experimental procedures: 881; Acknowledgements: 24; Figure legends: 568; Author contribution: 25; Conflict of interest: 13; Funding: 34; References: 1289\\n\\nSummaryIn plants, 24 nucleotide long heterochromatic siRNAs (het-siRNAs) transcriptionally regulate gene expression by RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). The biogenesis of most het-siRNAs depends on the plant-specific RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), and ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) is a major het-siRNA effector protein. Through genome-wide analysis of sRNA-seq data sets, we found that AGO4 is required for the accumulation of a small subset of het-siRNAs. The accumulation of AGO4-dependent het-siRNAs also requires several factors known to participate in the effector portion of the RdDM pathway, including RNA POLYMERASE V (POL V), DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2) and SAWADEE HOMEODOMAIN HOMOLOG 1 (SHH1). Like many AGO proteins, AGO4 is an endonuclease that can  slice RNAs. We found that a slicing-defective AGO4 was unable to fully recover AGO4-dependent het-siRNA accumulation from ago4 mutant plants. Collectively, our data suggest that AGO4-dependent siRNAs are secondary siRNAs dependent on the prior activity of the RdDM pathway at certain loci.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in various biological processes. Although more than 58,000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterised. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detection of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevents their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets. Here, we present \\\"RIblast\\\", an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. Computational experiments indicate that RIblast achieves a level of prediction accuracy similar to those of existing programs, but at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.",

    "abstract": "Proper cell size is essential for cellular function (Hall et al., 2004). Nonetheless, despite more than 100 years of work on the subject, the mechanisms that maintain cell size homeostasis are largely mysterious (Marshall et al., 2012). Cells in growing populations maintain cell size within a narrow range by coordinating growth and division. Bacterial and eukaryotic cells both demonstrate homeostatic size control, which maintains population-level variation in cell size within a certain range, and returns the population average to that range if it is perturbed (Marshall et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2012; Amodeo and Skotheim, 2015). Recent work has proposed two different strategies for size control: budding yeast has been proposed to use an inhibitor-dilution strategy to regulate size at the G1/S transition (Schmoller et al., 2015), while bacteria appear to use an adder strategy, in which a fixed amount of growth each generation causes cell size to converge on a stable average, a mechanism also suggested for budding yeast (Campos et al., 2014; Jun and Taheri-Araghi, 2015; Taheri-Araghi et al., 2015; Tanouchi et al., 2015; Soifer et al., 2016). Here we present evidence that cell size in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is regulated by a third strategy: the size dependent expression of the mitotic activator Cdc25. The cdc25 transcript levels are regulated such that smaller cells express less Cdc25 and larger cells express more Cdc25, creating an increasing concentration of Cdc25 as cell grow and providing a mechanism for cell to trigger cell division when they reach a threshold concentration of Cdc25. Since regulation of mitotic entry by Cdc25 is well conserved, this mechanism may provide a wide spread solution to the problem of size control in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is considered pivotal to recall, allowing retrieval of information not available in the immediate environment. In contrast, neocortex is thought to signal familiarity, and to contribute to recall only when called upon by the hippocampus. However, this view is not compatible with representational accounts of memory, which reject the mapping of cognitive processes onto brain regions. According to representational accounts, the hippocampus is not engaged by recall per se, rather it is engaged whenever hippocampal representations are required. To test whether hippocampus is engaged by recall when hippocampal representations are not required, we used functional imaging and a non-associative recall task, with images (objects, scenes) studied in isolation, and image-patches used as cues. As predicted by a representational account, hippocampal activation increased during recall of scenes - which are known to be processed by hippocampus - but not during recall of objects. Object recall instead engaged neocortical regions known to be involved in object-processing. Further supporting the representational account, effective connectivity analyses revealed that recall was associated with increased information flow out of lateral occipital cortex (object recall) and parahippocampal cortex (scene recall), suggesting that recall-related activation spread from neocortex to hippocampus, not the reverse.",

    "abstract": "Experimental evolution (EE) studies are powerful tools for observing molecular evolution \\\"in-action\\\" from populations sampled in controlled and natural environments. The advent of next generation sequencing technologies has made whole-genome and whole-population sampling possible, even for eukaryotic organisms with large genomes, and allowed us to locate the genes and variants responsible for genetic adaptation. While many computational tests have been developed for detecting regions under selection, they are mainly designed for static (single time) data, and work best when the favored allele is close to fixation.\\n\\nEE studies provide samples over multiple time points, underscoring the need for tools that can exploit the data. At the same time, EE studies are constrained by the limited time span since onset of selection, depending upon the generation time for the organism. This constraint impedes adaptation studies, as the population can only be evolve-and-resequenced for a small number of generations relative to the fixation time of the favored allele. Moreover, coverage in pool-sequenced experiments varies across replicates and time points, leading to heterogeneous ascertainment bias in measuring population allele frequency across different measurements.\\n\\nIn this article, we directly address these issues while developing tools for identifying selective sweep in pool-sequenced EE of sexual organisms and propose Composition of Likelihoods for Evolve-And-Resequence experiments (CO_SCPLOWLEARC_SCPLOW). Extensive simulations show that CO_SCPLOWLEARC_SCPLOW achieves higher power in detecting and localizing selection over a wide range of parameters. In contrast to existing methods, the CO_SCPLOWLEARC_SCPLOW statistics are robust to variation of coverage. CO_SCPLOWLEARC_SCPLOW also provides robust estimates of model parameters, including selection strength and overdominance, as byproduct of the statistical test, while being orders of magnitude faster than existing methods. Finally, we apply the CO_SCPLOWLEARC_SCPLOW statistic to data from a study of D. melanogaster adaptation to alternating temperatures and discover enrichment of genes related to \\\"response to heat\\\" and \\\"cold acclimation\\\".",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBrucellosis is a common and chronic disease of cattle and other bovids that often causes reproductive disorders. Natural infection in cattle is caused by Brucella abortus and transmission typically occurs during abortions, calving, or nursing. Brucellosis is also a major zoonotic disease due to contamination of dairy products or contact with the tissues of infected animals. Brucellosis has been eradicated from most of the developed world in the last forty years but persists in many regions; B. abortus remains prevalent in portions of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Central and South America, as well as in the Mediterranean basin. Specifically, B. abortus has persisted in southern Italy in both cattle and water buffalo. Previous attempts at analyzing the genetic structure of B. abortus in Italy have been challenging due to the limited genetic variability and unresolved global population structure of this pathogen.\\n\\nResultsWe conducted genome-wide phylogenetic analysis on 11 representative strains of B. abortus from Italy, and compared these sequences to a worldwide collection of publically available genomes. Italian isolates belong to three clades basal to the global B. abortus lineage. Using six assays designed to identify substructure within the Italian clades in a collection of 261 isolates, one clade predominates throughout endemic districts in the country, while the other two clades are more geographically restricted to southern Italy.\\n\\nConclusionsAlthough related strains exist worldwide, B. abortus isolates from Italy are substantially different than those found in much of the rest of Europe and North America, and are more closely related to strains from the Middle East and Asia. Our assays targeting genetic substructure within Italy allowed us to identify the major lineages quickly and inexpensively, without having to generate whole genome sequences for a large isolate collection. These findings highlight the importance of genetic studies to assess the status and the history of pathogens.",

To which extent RNA structure influences protein binding in the presence or absence of a sequence motif is still poorly understood.

We developed ssHMM, an RNA motif finder that combines a hidden Markov model (HMM) with Gibbs sampling to learn the joint sequence and structure binding preferences of RBPs from high-throughput data, such as CLIP-Seq sequences, and visualizes them as a graph. Evaluations on synthetic data showed that ssHMM reliably recovers fuzzy sequence motifs in 80 to 100% of the cases. It produces motifs with higher information content than existing tools and is faster than other methods on large datasets.
