    "abstract": "In the period before spawning, freshwater crayfish females develop glair glands on the underside of the pleon. These glands produce the mucus for a transient tent-like structure in which the eggs are fertilized and attached to the pleopods. Long-term observation of females of the bisexually reproducing slough crayfish, Procambarus fallax, kept in captivity revealed that glair glands developed in late winter and late summer of each year independent of the presence of males. However, in contrast to mated females unmated females did neither form a fertilization tent nor spawn. Their glair glands persisted for an unusually long period of time and disappeared only during the next moult. Apparently, females use information on sperm availability to either reproduce or save the resources. Marbled crayfish, Procambarus virginalis, a parthenogenetic descendant of slough crayfish, developed glair glands in approximately the same periods of the year but spawned despite of the absence of mating. These findings indicate that on their way from gonochorism to parthenogenesis regulation of glair gland activity and spawning has been decoupled from mating. Therefore, the species pair Procambarus fallax/Procambarus virginalis seems to be particularly suitable to investigate the physiological, molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying spawning in freshwater crayfish.",

    "abstract": "The genetic component of complex disease risk in humans remains largely unexplained. A corollary is that the allelic spectrum of genetic variants contributing to complex disease risk is unknown. Theoretical models that relate population genetic processes to the maintenance of genetic variation for quantitative traits may suggest profitable avenues for future experimental design. Here we use forward simulation to model a genomic region evolving under a balance between recurrent deleterious mutation and Gaussian stabilizing selection. We consider multiple genetic and demographic models, and several different methods for identifying genomic regions harboring variants associated with complex disease risk. We demonstrate that the model of gene action, relating genotype to phenotype, has a qualitative effect on several relevant aspects of the population genetic architecture of a complex trait. In particular, the genetic model impacts genetic variance component partitioning across the allele frequency spectrum and the power of statistical tests. Models with partial recessivity closely match the minor allele frequency distribution of significant hits from empirical genome-wide association studies without requiring homozygous effect-sizes to be small. We highlight a particular gene-based model of incomplete recessivity that is appealing from first principles. Under that model, deleterious mutations in a genomic region partially fail to complement one another. This model of gene-based recessivity predicts the empirically observed inconsistency between twin and SNP based estimated of dominance heritability. Furthermore, this model predicts considerable levels of unexplained variance associated with intralocus epistasis. Our results suggest a need for improved statistical tools for region based genetic association and heritability estimation.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGene action determines how mutations affect phenotype. When placed in an evolutionary context, the details of the genotype-to-phenotype model can impact the maintenance of genetic variation for complex traits. Likewise, non-equilibrium demographic history may affect patterns of genetic variation. Here, we explore the impact of genetic model and population growth on distribution of genetic variance across the allele frequency spectrum underlying risk for a complex disease. Using forward-in-time population genetic simulations, we show that the genetic model has important impacts on the composition of variation for complex disease risk in a population. We explicitly simulate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and perform heritability estimation on population samples. A particular model of gene-based partial recessivity, based on allelic non-complementation, aligns well with empirical results. This model is congruent with the dominance variance estimates from both SNPs and twins, and the minor allele frequency distribution of GWAS hits.",

    "abstract": "Thomas Kent was an Irish rebel who was executed by the British forces in the aftermath of the Rising armed insurrection of 1916 and buried in a shallow grave on Cork prison's grounds. In 2015, ninety-nine years after his death, a state funeral was offered to his living family to honor his role in the struggle for Irish independence. However, due to inaccuracies in record keeping, the bodily remains from Cork prison that supposedly belonged to Kent could not be identified with absolute certainty. At the request of the Irish National Police (An Garda Siochana), we identified the remains presumed to be those of Kent using a novel method that compared homozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms obtained from next-generation shotgun sequencing with genetic data from two of Kent's known living relatives who share with him a third degree relationship. DNA degradation resulted in low sequence depth of Thomas Kent's DNA and only a few loci appeared as heterozygous, rendering traditional methods of relatedness estimation unusable. To remove potential bias, all loci were therefore analysed as homozygous, leading to a process we refer to as \\\"forced homozygote approach\\\". This procedure reduces the expected degree of relatedness to half of what is expected when heterozygotes are included; thus, Kent had a relationship coefficient (Queller and Goodnight's Rxy) of 12.5% with his third-degree relatives instead of the expected 25%. The results were confirmed using simulated data for different relatedness classes (2000 simulated individuals per class), also confirming Thomas Kent's identity. We argue that this method provides a necessary alternative for relatedness estimations, not only in forensic analysis, but also in ancient DNA studies, where reduced amounts of genetic information can limit the application of traditional methods.",

    "abstract": "Adaptations may require multiple mutations that are beneficial only in combination. To adapt, a lineage must acquire mutations that are individually neutral or deleterious before gaining the beneficial combination, thereby crossing a plateau or valley, respectively, in the mapping from genotype to fitness. Spatial population structure can facilitate plateau and valley crossing by allowing neutral and deleterious lineages to survive longer and produce more beneficial mutants. Here, we analyze adaptation across a two-mutation plateau or valley in an asexual population that is subdivided into discrete subpopulations, or demes, connected by migration. We describe how subdivision alters the dynamics of adaptation from those in an equally sized unstructured population and give a complete quantitative description of these dynamics for the island migration model. Subdivision can significantly decrease the waiting time for the adaptation if demes and migration rates are small enough that single-mutant lineages fix in one or more demes before producing the beneficial double mutant. But, the potential decrease is small in very large populations and may also be limited by the slow spread of the beneficial mutant in extremely subdivided populations. Subdivision has a smaller effect on the probability that the population adapts very quickly than on the mean time to adapt, which has important consequences in some applications, such as the development of cancer. Our results provide a general and intuitive framework for predicting the effects of spatial structure in other models and in natural populations.",
