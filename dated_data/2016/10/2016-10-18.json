    "abstract": "Axons are the cable-like neuronal processes wiring the nervous system. They contain parallel bundles of microtubules as structural backbones, surrounded by regularly-spaced actin rings termed the periodic membrane skeleton (PMS). Despite being an evolutionarily-conserved, ubiquitous, highly-ordered feature of axons, the function of PMS is unknown. Here we studied PMS abundance, organisation and function, combining versatile Drosophila genetics with super-resolution microscopy and various functional readouts. Analyses with 11 different actin regulators and 3 actin-targeting drugs suggest PMS to contain short actin filaments which are depolymerisation resistant and sensitive to spectrin, adducin and nucleator deficiency - consistent with microscopy-derived models proposing PMS as specialised cortical actin. Upon actin removal we observed gaps in microtubule bundles, reduced microtubule polymerisation and reduced axon numbers suggesting a role of PMS in microtubule organisation. These effects become strongly enhanced when carried out in neurons lacking the microtubule-stabilising protein Short stop (Shot). Combining the aforementioned actin manipulations with Shot deficiency revealed a close correlation between PMS abundance and microtubule regulation, consistent with a model in which PMS-dependent microtubule polymerisation contributes to their maintenance in axons. We discuss potential implications of this novel PMS function along axon shafts for axon maintenance and regeneration.\\n\\nSignificance statementAxons are cable-like neuronal processes that are up to a meter long in humans. These delicate structures often need to be maintained for an organisms lifetime, i.e. up to a century in humans. Unsurprisingly, we gradually lose about 50% of axons as we age. Bundles of microtubules form the structural backbones and highways for life-sustaining transport within axons, and maintenance of these bundles is essential for axonal longevity. However, the mechanisms which actively maintain axonal microtubules are poorly understood. Here we identify cortical actin as an important factor maintaining microtubule polymerisation in axons. This finding provides potential explanations for the previously identified, but unexplained, links between mutations in genes encoding cortical actin regulators and neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Oct4 and Sox2 regulate the expression of target genes such as Nanog, Fgf4 and Utf1, by binding to their respective regulatory motifs. Their functional cooperation is reflected in their ability to heterodimerise on adjacent cis regulatory elements, the composite Sox/Oct motif. Given that Oct4 and Sox2 regulate many developmental genes, a quantitative analysis of their synergistic action on different Sox/Oct motifs would yield valuable insights into the mechanisms of early embryonic development. In this study, we measured binding affinities of Oct4 and Sox2 to different Sox/Oct motifs using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). We found that the synergistic binding interaction is driven mainly by the level of Sox2 in the case of the Fgf4s Sox/Oct motif. Taking into account that Sox2 expression levels fluctuate more than Oct4, our finding could explain how Sox2 controls the segregation of the cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) into the epiblast (EPI) and the primitive endoderm (PE) populations within the developing rodent blastocyst.",

    "abstract": "Inbreeding increases parent-offspring relatedness and commonly reduces offspring viability, shaping selection on reproductive interactions involving relatives and associated parental investment (PI). Nevertheless, theories predicting selection for inbreeding versus inbreeding avoidance and selection for optimal PI have only been considered separately, precluding prediction of optimal PI and associated reproductive strategy given inbreeding. We unify inbreeding and PI theory, demonstrating that optimal PI increases when a female's inbreeding decreases the viability of her offspring. Inbreeding females should therefore produce fewer offspring due to the fundamental trade-off between offspring number and PI. Accordingly, selection for inbreeding versus inbreeding avoidance changes when females can adjust PI with the degree that they inbreed. In contrast, optimal PI does not depend on whether a focal female is herself inbred. However, inbreeding causes optimal PI to increase given strict monogamy and associated biparental investment compared to female-only investment. Our model implies that understanding evolutionary dynamics of inbreeding strategy, inbreeding depression, and PI requires joint consideration of the expression of each in relation to the other. Overall, we demonstrate that existing PI and inbreeding theories represent special cases of a more general theory, implying that intrinsic links between inbreeding and PI affect evolution of behaviour and intra-familial conflict.",

    "abstract": "Short-read, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is now broadly used to identify rare or de novo mutations in population samples and disease cohorts. However, NGS data is known to be error-prone and post-processing pipelines have primarily focused on the removal of spurious mutations or \\\"false positives\\\" in downstream genome datasets. Less attention has been paid to characterizing the fraction of missing mutations or \\\"false negatives\\\" (FN). We design a phylogeny-aware tool to determine false negatives [PhyloFaN] and describe how read coverage and reference bias affect the FN rate. Using thousand-fold coverage NGS data from both Illumina HiSeq and Complete Genomics platforms derived from the 1000 Genomes Project, we first characterize the false negative rate in human mtDNA genomes. The false negative rate for the publically available callsets is 17-20%, even for extremely high coverage haploid data. We demonstrate that high FN rates are not limited to mtDNA by comparing autosomal data from 28 publically available full genomes to intergenic Sanger sequenced regions for each individual. We examine both low-coverage Illumina and high-coverage Complete Genomics genomes. We show that the FN rate varies between [~]6%-18% and that false-positive rates are considerably lower (<3%). The FN rate is strongly dependent on calling pipeline parameters, as well as read coverage. Our results demonstrate that missing mutations are a significant feature of genomic datasets and imply additional fine-tuning of bioinformatics pipelines is needed. We provide a tool which can be used to quantify the FN rate for haploid genomic experiments, without additional generation of validation data.\\n\\nData depositionData and software are freely available on the Henn Lab website: https://ecoevo.stonybrook.edu/hennlab/data-software/\\n\\nSoftwareGITHUB via https://ecoevo.stonybrook.edu/hennlab/data-software/",

    "abstract": "Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) are increasingly found in eukaryotic genomes1, yet little is known about their origins, dynamics, or function. Here, we provide a compelling example of a DNA virus that readily integrates into a eukaryotic genome where it acts as an inducible antiviral defense system. We found that the virophage mavirus2, a parasite of the giant Cafeteria roenbergensis virus (CroV)3, integrates at multiple sites within the nuclear genome of the marine protozoan Cafeteria roenbergensis. The endogenous mavirus is structurally and genetically similar to the eukaryotic Maverick/Polinton DNA transposons4,5 and endogenous polintoviruses6. Provirophage genes are not constitutively expressed, but are specifically activated by superinfection with CroV, which induces the production of infectious mavirus particles. Virophages inhibit the replication of giant viruses and a beneficial effect of provirophages on their host cells has been hypothesized2,7. We found that provirophage-carrying cells are not directly protected from CroV; however, lysis of these cells releases reactivated mavirus particles that are then able to suppress CroV replication and enhance host survival of other CroV-infected flagellate populations in a dose-dependent manner. The host-parasite interaction described here involves an altruistic aspect that is unique among microbes. Our results demonstrate a direct link between mavirus and Maverick/Polinton elements and suggest that provirophages can defend natural protist populations against infection by giant viruses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobial consortia composed of autotrophic and heterotrophic species abound in nature, yet examples of synthetic communities with mixed metabolism are limited in the laboratory. We previously engineered a model cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, to secrete the bulk of the carbon it fixes as sucrose, a carbohydrate that can be utilized by many other microbes. Here, we tested the capability of sucrose-secreting cyanobacteria to act as a flexible platform for the construction of synthetic, light-driven consortia by pairing them with three disparate heterotrophs: Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The comparison of these different co-culture dyads reveals general design principles for the construction of robust autotroph/heterotroph consortia.\\n\\nMain findingsWe observed heterotrophic growth dependent upon cyanobacterial photosynthate in each co-culture pair. Furthermore, these synthetic consortia could be stabilized over the long-term (weeks to months) and both species could persist when challenged with specific perturbations. Stability and productivity of autotroph/heterotroph co-cultures was dependent on heterotroph sucrose utilization, as well as other species-independent interactions that we observed across all dyads. One interaction we observed to destabilize consortia was that non-sucrose byproducts of photosynthesis negatively impacted heterotroph growth. Conversely, inoculation of each heterotrophic species enhanced cyanobacterial growth in comparison to axenic cultures Finally, these consortia can be flexibly programmed for photoproduction of target compounds and proteins; by changing the heterotroph in co-culture to specialized strains of B. subtilis or E. coli we demonstrate production of alpha-amylase and polyhydroxybutyrate, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionsEnabled by the unprecedented flexibility of this consortia design, we uncover species-independent design principles that influence cyanobacteria/heterotroph consortia robustness. The modular nature of these communities and their unusual robustness exhibits promise as a platform for highly-versatile photoproduction strategies that capitalize on multi-species interactions and could be utilized as a tool for the study of nascent symbioses. Further consortia improvements via engineered interventions beyond those we show here (i.e. increased efficiency growing on sucrose) could improve these communities as production platforms.",

In this paper we show that the problem of extracting neural data about the structure of a sequence is especially acute for fMRI, which is almost exclusively the modality used in human experiments.

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms of sensing noxious mechanical force by nociceptive sensory neurons remain poorly understood. Traditional methods for probing mechanical nociception behavioral responses are labor intensive and involve the testing of one animal at a time. This time consuming process of behavioral testing has largely precluded large scale analyses. Indeed, large scale genetic screens that have been performed thus far have been largely restricted to the investigation of ion channel genes [1]. Here we describe a new behavioral assay for mechanical nociception in which tens of animals can be stimulated simultaneously. In this assay, third instar larvae of the genetically tractable organism Drosophila melanogaster are mechanically stimulated with tungsten particles that are fired from a gun. We have used the new assay to carry out a genetic screen in which we investigated the function of 231 nociceptor enriched genes with tissue-specific RNA interference. Targeting of 21 genes resulted in mechanically insensitive phenotypes and targeting of a single gene resulted in a hypersensitive mechanical nociception phenotype. Six of the identified genes were previously uncharacterized and these were named after famed Roman gladiators (Spartacus (CG14186), Commodus (CG1311), Flamma (CG10914), Crixus(CG6685), Spiculus (CG10932), and Verus (CG31324)).",

For this purpose information about the order of the individual stimuli in the sequence needs to be in active and accessible form in STM over a period of few seconds. Here we investigated how the temporal order information is shared between the presentation and response phases of an STM task. We trained a classification algorithm on the fMRI activity patterns from the presentation phase of the STM task to predict the order of the items during the subsequent recognition phase. While voxels in a number of brain regions represented positional information during either presentation and recognition phases, only voxels in the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) represented position consistently across task phases. A shared positional code in the ATL might reflect verbal recoding of visual sequences to facilitate the maintenance of order information over several seconds.",

A primary consideration was to make the mechanism accessible and affordable, and in doing so, lower the cases of Obstructive Sleep Apnea that go undiagnosed due to the cost and inconvenience associated with the traditional diagnosis method--a Polysomnogram. Bluetooth capability was an additional consideration so that the device would transmit data directly to an android smartphone, eliminating the need for an additional output mechanism. The total cost of the device, quite surprisingly, did not exceed $30, and therein rendered the device an accessible, affordable mechanism for diagnosis.

    "abstract": "We study the binding of plant hormone IAA on its receptor TIR1 introducing a novel computa-tional method that we call tomographic docking and that accounts for interactions occurring along the depth of the binding pocket. Our results suggest that selectivity is related to constraints that potential ligands encounter on their way from the surface of the protein to their final position at the pocket bottom. Tomographic docking helps develop specific hypotheses about ligand binding, distinguishing binders from non-binders, and suggests that binding is a three-step mechanism, consisting of engagement with a niche in the back wall of the pocket, interaction with a molecular filter which allows or precludes further descent of ligands, and binding on the pocket base. Only molecules that are able to descend the pocket and bind at its base allow the co-receptor IAA7 to bind on the complex, thus behaving as active auxins. Analyzing the interactions at different depths, our new method helps in identifying critical residues that constitute preferred future study targets and in the quest for safe and effective herbicides. Also, it has the potential to extend the utility of docking from ligand searches to the study of processes contributing to selectivity.",

We then link contigs if they can be unambiguously joined or if the corresponding increase in likelihood is substantially greater than that of other possible joins of those contigs.

    "abstract": "O_LIGiven the prevalence of missing data on species traits - Raunkiaeran shorfall -- and its importance for theoretical and empirical investigations, several methods have been proposed to fill sparse databases. Despite its advantages, imputation of missing data can introduce biases. Here, we evaluate the bias in descriptive statistics, model parameters, and phylogenetic signal estimation from imputed databases under different missing and imputing scenarios.\\nC_LIO_LIWe simulated coalescent phylogenies and traits under Brownian Motion and different Ornstein-Uhlenbeck evolutionary models. Missing values were created using three scenarios: missing completely at random, missing at random but phylogenetically structured and missing at random but correlated with some other variable. We considered four methods for handling missing data: delete missing values, imputation based on observed mean trait value, Phylogenetic Eigenvectors Maps and Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations. Finally, we assessed estimation errors of descriptive statistics (mean, variance), regression coefficient, Morans correlogram and Blombergs K of imputed traits.\\nC_LIO_LIWe found that percentage of missing data, missing mechanisms, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck strength and handling methods were important to define estimation errors. When data were missing completely at random, descriptive statistics were well estimated but Morans correlogram and Blombergs K were not well estimated, depending on handling methods. We also found that handling methods performed worse when data were missing at random, but phylogenetically structured. In this case adding phylogenetic information provided better estimates. Although the error caused by imputation was correlated with estimation errors, we found that such relationship is not linear with estimation errors getting larger as the imputation error increases.\\nC_LIO_LIImputed trait databases could bias ecological and evolutionary analyses. We advise researchers to share their raw data along with their imputed database, flagging imputed data and providing information on the imputation process. Thus, users can and should consider the pattern of missing data and then look for the best method to overcome this problem. In addition, we suggest the development of phylogenetic methods that consider imputation uncertainty, phylogenetic autocorrelation and preserve the level of phylogenetic signal of the original data.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Approximately half of proteins with experimentally determined structures can interact with other copies of themselves and assemble into homomeric complexes, the overwhelming majority of which (>96%) are symmetric. Although homomerisation is often assumed to be functionally beneficial and the result of evolutionary selection, there has been little systematic analysis of the relationship between homomer structure and function. Here, utilizing the large numbers of structures and functional annotations now available, we have investigated how proteins that assemble into different types of homomers are associated with different biological functions. We observe that homomers from different symmetry groups are significantly enriched in distinct functions, and can often provide simple physical and geometrical explanations for these associations in regards to substrate recognition or physical environment. One of the strongest associations is the tendency for metabolic enzymes to form dihedral complexes, which we suggest is closely related to allosteric regulation. We provide a physical explanation for why allostery is related to dihedral complexes: it allows for efficient propagation of conformational changes across isologous (i.e. symmetric) interfaces. Overall we demonstrate a clear relationship between protein function and homomer symmetry that has important implications for understanding protein evolution, as well as for predicting protein function and quaternary structure.",

    "abstract": "A critical feature of all cellular processes is the ability to control the rate of gene or protein expression and metabolic flux in changing environments through regulatory feedback. We review the many ways that regulation is represented through causal, logical and dynamical components. Formalizing the nature of these components promotes effective comparison among distinct regulatory networks and provides a common framework for the potential design and control of regulatory systems in synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "Due to the drop in sequencing cost, the number of sequenced genomes is increasing rapidly. To improve power of rare variant tests, these sequenced samples could be used as external control samples in addition to control samples from the study itself. However, when using external controls, possible batch effects due to the use of different sequencing platforms or genotype calling pipelines can dramatically increase type I error rates. To address this, we propose novel summary statistics-based single and gene- or region-based rare-variant tests that allow the integration of external controls while controlling for type I error. Our approach is based on the insight that batch effects on a given variant can be assessed by comparing odds ratio estimates using internal controls only vs. using combined control samples of internal and external controls. From simulation experiments and the analysis of data from age related macular degeneration and type 2 diabetes studies, we demonstrate that our method can substantially improve power while controlling for type I error rate.",

    "abstract": "Scientific discovery and insight into the biological foundations of human intelligence have advanced considerably with progress in neuroimaging. Neuroimaging methods allow for not only an exploration of what biological characteristics underlie intelligence and creativity, but also a detailed assessment of how these biological characteristics emerge through child and adolescent development. In the past 10 years, functional connectivity, a metric of coherence in activation across brain regions, has been used extensively to probe cognitive function; however more recently neuroscientists have begun to investigate the dynamics of these functional connectivity patterns, revealing important insight into these networks as a result. In the present article, we expand current theories on the neural basis of human intelligence by developing a framework that integrates both how short-term dynamic fluctuations in brain networks and long-term development of brain networks over time contribute to intelligence and creativity. Applying this framework, we propose testable hypotheses regarding the neural and developmental correlates of intelligence. We review important topics in both network neuroscience and developmental neuroscience, and we consolidate these insights into a Network Dynamics Theory of human intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Perception can be characterized as an inference process in which beliefs are formed about the world given sensory observations. The sensory neurons implementing these computations, however, are classically characterized with firing rates, tuning curves, and correlated noise. To connect these two levels of description, we derive expressions for how inferences themselves vary across trials, and how this predicts task-dependent patterns of correlated variability in the responses of sensory neurons. Importantly, our results require minimal assumptions about the nature of the inferred variables or how their distributions are encoded in neural activity. We show that our predictions are in agreement with existing measurements across a range of tasks and brain areas. Our results reinterpret task-dependent sources of neural covariability as signatures of Bayesian inference and provide new insights into their cause and their function.\n\nHighlightsO_LIGeneral connection between neural covariability and approximate Bayesian inference based on variability in the encoded posterior density.\nC_LIO_LIOptimal learning of a discrimination task predicts top-down components of noise correlations and choice probabilities in agreement with existing data.\nC_LIO_LIDifferential correlations are predicted to grow over the course of perceptual learning.\nC_LIO_LINeural covariability can be used to  reverse-engineer the subjects internal model.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Aim.Biodiversity loss, measured as count of extinction events, is a key component of biodiversity change, and can significantly impact ecosystem services. However, estimation of the loss has focused mostly on per-species extinction rates measured over limited numbers of spatial scales, with no theory linking small-scale extirpations with global extinctions. Here we provide such link by introducing the relationship between area and per-species probability of extinction (PxAR) and between area and count of realized extinction events in that area (NxAR). We show theoretical and empirical forms of these relationships, and we discuss their role in perception and estimation of the current extinction crisis.\\n\\nLocationUSA, Europe, Czech Republic, Barro Colorado Island\\n\\nMethodsWe derived the expected forms of PxAR and NxAR from a range of theoretical frameworks based on theory of island biogeography, neutral models, and species-area relationships. We constructed PxAR and NxAR in five empirical datasets on butterflies, plants, trees and birds, collected over range of spatial scales.\\n\\nResultsBoth the theoretical arguments and empirical data support monotonically decreasing PxAR, i.e. per-species extinction probability decreasing with increasing area; however, we also report a rare theoretical possibility of locally increasing PxAR. In contrast, both theory and data revealed complex NxAR, i.e. counts of extinction events follow variety of relationships with area, including nonlinear unimodal, multimodal and U-shaped relationships, depending on region and taxon.\\n\\nMain conclusionsThe uncovered wealth of forms of NxAR can explain why biodiversity change (the net outcome of losses and gains) also appears scale-dependent. Furthermore, the complex scale dependence of PxAR and NxAR means that global extinctions indicate little about local extirpations, and vice versa. Hence, effort should be made to understand and report extinction crisis as a scale-dependent problem. In this effort, estimation of scaling relationships such as PxAR and NxAR should be central.",
