    "abstract": "BackgroundGenetic surveillance of the human filarial parasite, Onchocerca volvulus, from onchocerciasis endemic regions will ideally focus on genotyping individual infective larval stages collected from their intermediate host, Simuliid blackflies. However, blackflies also transmit other Onchocerca species, including the cattle parasite O. ochengi, which are difficult to distinguish from the human parasite based on morphological characteristics alone. This study describes a versatile approach to discriminate between O. volvulus and O. ochengi that is demonstrated using parasite infective larvae dissected from blackflies.\\n\\nResultsA speciation assay was designed based on genetic differentiation between O. volvulus and O. ochengi mitochondrial genome sequences that can be performed in highthroughput high-resolution melt (HRM)- or lower throughput conventional restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. This assay was validated on 185 Onchocerca larvae dissected from blackflies captured from 14 communities in Ghana throughout 2011-13. The frequency of O. ochengi was approximately 67 % of all larvae analysed, which is significantly higher than previously reported in this region. Furthermore, the species distribution was not uniform throughout the study region, with 25 %, 47 % and 93 % of O. volvulus being found in the western-most (Black Volta, Tain and Tombe), the central (Pru) and eastern-most (Daka) river basins, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionsThis tool provides a simple and cost-effective approach to determine the identity and distribution of two Onchocerca species, and will be valuable for future genetic studies that focus on parasites collected from blackflies. The results presented highlight the need to discriminate Onchocerca species in transmission studies, as the frequency of each species varied significantly between the communities studied.",

    "abstract": "Many SNPs that are predicted to encode deleterious amino acid variants. These mildly deleterious mutations may provide unique insights into population history, the dynamics of selection, and the genetic bases of phenotypes. This may be especially true for domesticated species, where a history of bottlenecks and selection can contribute to the accumulation of deleterious SNPs (dSNPs). Here we investigate the numbers and frequencies of deleterious variants in Asian rice (O. sativa), focusing on two varieties (japonica and indica) that may have been domesticated independently and their wild relative (O. rufipogon). Most dSNPs were lost during domestication, but comparative analyses in two population datasets indicated that the remaining dSNPs shifted in site frequency spectrum (SFS) relative to synonymous SNPs. Moreover, dSNPs were enriched within low recombination regions of the genome and experienced frequency increases similar to synonymous SNPs within regions of putative selective sweeps. A characteristic feature of rice domestication was a shift in mating system from outcrossing to predominantly selfing. Forward simulations suggest that this shift in mating system may have been the dominant factor in shaping extant rice diversity.",

    "abstract": "The study of trade-offs among major life history components (age at maturity, lifespan and reproduction) allowed the development of a quantitative framework to understand how environmental variation shapes patterns of biodiversity among and within species.\\n\\nBecause every environment is inherently spatially structured, and in most cases temporally variable, individuals need to move within and among habitats to maximize fitness. Dispersal is often assumed to be tightly integrated into life histories through genetic correlations with other vital traits. This assumption is particularly strong within the context of a fast-slow continuum of life-history variation. Such a framework is to date used to explain many aspects of population and community dynamics. Evidence for a consistent and context-independent integration of dispersal in life histories is, however, weak. We therefore advocate the explicit integration of dispersal into life history theory as a principal axis of variation influencing fitness, that is free to evolve, independently of other life history traits.\\n\\nWe synthesize theoretical and empirical evidence on the central role of dispersal and its evolutionary dynamics on the spatial distribution of ecological strategies and its impact on population spread, invasions and coexistence. By applying an optimality framework we show that the inclusion of dispersal as an independent dimension of life histories might substantially change our view on evolutionary trajectories in spatially structured environments.\\n\\nBecause changes in the spatial configuration of habitats affect the costs of movement and dispersal, adaptations to reduce these costs will increase phenotypic divergence among and within populations. We outline how this phenotypic heterogeneity is anticipated to further impact population and community dynamics.",

Here we report that members of the mammalian cell entry (MCE) protein family form structurally diverse hexameric rings and barrels with a central channel capable of mediating lipid transport. The E. coli MCE protein, MlaD, forms a ring as part of a larger ABC transporter complex in the inner membrane, and employs a soluble lipid-binding protein to ferry lipids between MlaD and an outer membrane protein complex. In contrast, EM structures of two other E. coli MCE proteins show that YebT forms an elongated tube consisting of seven stacked MCE rings, and PqiB adopts a syringe-like architecture. Both YebT and PqiB create channels of sufficient length to span the entire periplasmic space.

The evolutionary history and origins of animal miRNAs is however unclear, and it is not known when they evolved and on how many occasions. We have therefore investigated the presence of miRNAs and the necessary miRNA biogenesis machinery in a large group of unicellular relatives of animals, Ichthyosporea. By small RNA sequencing we find evidence for at least four genes in the genus Sphaeroforma that satisfy the criteria for the annotation of animal miRNA genes. Three of these miRNAs are conserved and expressed across sphaeroformid species. Furthermore, we identify homologues of the animal miRNA biogenesis genes across a wide range of ichthyosporeans, including Drosha and Pasha which make up the animal specific Microprocessor complex. Taken together we report the first evidence for bona fide miRNA genes and the presence of the miRNA-processing pathway in unicellular Choanozoa, implying that the origin of animal miRNAs and the Microprocessor complex predates multicellular animals.",

The labeling of OPCs in the ON was performed by injection of a retrovirus vector carrying the lacZ gene into the lateral ventricle, or by inducible Cre/loxP of Olig2-positive cells. The retrovirus labeling revealed that ventricular zone-derived cells of the fetal forebrain relocated to the ON and differentiated into oligodendrocytes. In addition, lineage tracing of Olig2-positive cells and whole mount staining of PDGFR-positive cells demonstrated that OPCs appeared by E12.5 in the preoptic area, and spread caudally to enter the ON. Our results also suggest that OPCs generated during the early stage are depleted from the ON after maturation.",

Hfq facilitates pairing between small regulatory RNAs (sRNA) and their corresponding mRNA targets by binding both RNAs and bringing them into close proximity. Hfq homologs self-assemble into homo-hexameric rings, with at least two distinct surfaces that bind RNA. Recently, another binding site--dubbed the  lateral rim--has been implicated in sRNA*mRNA annealing; the RNA-binding properties of this site appear to be rather subtle, and its degree of evolutionary conservation is unknown. An Hfq homolog has been identified in the phylogenetically deep-branching thermophile Aquifex aeolicus (Aae), but little is known about the structures and functions of Hfq from basal bacterial lineages such as the Aquificae. Thus, we have cloned, overexpressed, purified, crystallized, and biochemically characterized Aae Hfq. We have determined the structures of Aae Hfq in space-groups P1 and P6, both to 1.5 [A] resolution, and we have discovered nanomolar-scale binding affinities for uridine- and adenosine-rich RNAs. Co-crystallization with U6 RNA reveals that the outer rim of the Aae Hfq hexamer features a well-defined binding pocket that is selective for uracil. This Aae Hfq structure, combined with biochemical and biophysical characterization of the homolog, reveals deep evolutionary conservation of the lateral RNA-binding mode, and lays a foundation for further studies of Hfq-associated RNA biology in ancient bacterial phyla.",

In combination with epidemiological methods, WGS is able to identify both sources and transmission-pathways during disease outbreak investigations. This review provides the current state of knowledge on the application of WGS in the epidemiology of Campylobacter jejuni, the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the European Union. We describe how WGS has improved surveillance and outbreak detection of C. jejuni infections and how WGS has increased our understanding of the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of this pathogen. However, the full implementation of this methodology in real-time is still hampered by a few hurdles. The limited insight into the genetic diversity of different lineages of C. jejuni impedes the validity of assumed genetic relationships. Furthermore, efforts are needed to reach a consensus on which analytic pipeline to use and how to define the strains cut-off value for epidemiological association while taking the needs and realities of public health microbiology in consideration. Even so, we claim that ample evidence is available to support the benefit of integrating WGS in the monitoring of C. jejuni infections and outbreak investigations.",

    "abstract": "It has been recently estimated that one-third of the world population will be infected by Zika virus, but unfortunately so far there is no vaccine or medicine available. In particular, the special concern on the vaccine treatment to Zika and Dengue arising from antibody-dependent enhancement strongly emphasizes the irreplaceable role of its NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) as a target for anti-Zika drug discovery/design due to its absolutely-essential role in viral replication. Very recently we identified two small molecules inhibit Zika NS2B-NS3pro in non-competitive mode, with Ki values of 0.57 and 2.02 {micro}M respective for p-Nitrophenyl-p-guanidino benzoate and qucertin. Here, by molecular docking, we show that although one is designed compound while another is a natural product, both molecules bind to the same pocket on the back of the substrate-binding pocket of Zika NS2B-NS3pro. As the two inhibitors fundamentally differ from cn-716, the only known peptidomimetic boronic acid inhibitor in both structure scaffolds and inhibitory modes, our discovery might open up a new avenue for the future development of allosteric inhibitors, which is highly demanded to achieve therapeutic inhibition of flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes. Furthermore, as qucertin is abundant in many vegetables and fruits such caper, lovage, tea and red onion, our results should benefit the public to immediately fight Zika virus.",

We recently reported the characterization of Cpf1, the effector nuclease of a novel type V-A CRISPR system, and demonstrated that it can be adapted for genome editing in mammalian cells (Zetsche et al., 2015). Unlike Cas9, which utilizes a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) as well as the endogenous RNaseIII for maturation of its dual crRNA:tracrRNA guides (Deltcheva et al., 2011), guide processing of the Cpf1 system proceeds in the absence of tracrRNA or other Cas (CRISPR associated) genes (Zetsche et al., 2015) (Figure 1a), suggesting that Cpf1 is sufficient for pre-crRNA maturation. This has important implications for genome editing, as it would provide a simple route to multiplex targeting. Here, we show for two Cpf1 orthologs that no other factors are required for array processing and demonstrate multiplex gene editing in mammalian cells as well as in the mouse brain by using a designed single CRISPR array.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=164 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/049122_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (35K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f0c15corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@126a6fdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9d6a2eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a61f75_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1C_FLOATNO Cpf1 mediates processing of pre-crRNA.
