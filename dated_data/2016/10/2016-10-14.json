    "abstract": "Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) are increasingly found in eukaryotic genomes1, yet little is known about their origins, dynamics, or function. Here, we provide a compelling example of a DNA virus that readily integrates into a eukaryotic genome where it acts as an inducible antiviral defense system. We found that the virophage mavirus2, a parasite of the giant Cafeteria roenbergensis virus (CroV)3, integrates at multiple sites within the nuclear genome of the marine protozoan Cafeteria roenbergensis. The endogenous mavirus is structurally and genetically similar to the eukaryotic Maverick/Polinton DNA transposons4,5 and endogenous polintoviruses6. Provirophage genes are not constitutively expressed, but are specifically activated by superinfection with CroV, which induces the production of infectious mavirus particles. Virophages inhibit the replication of giant viruses and a beneficial effect of provirophages on their host cells has been hypothesized2,7. We found that provirophage-carrying cells are not directly protected from CroV; however, lysis of these cells releases reactivated mavirus particles that are then able to suppress CroV replication and enhance host survival of other CroV-infected flagellate populations in a dose-dependent manner. The host-parasite interaction described here involves an altruistic aspect that is unique among microbes. Our results demonstrate a direct link between mavirus and Maverick/Polinton elements and suggest that provirophages can defend natural protist populations against infection by giant viruses.",

    "abstract": "Predicting how species will respond to the rapid climatic changes predicted this century is an urgent task. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) use the current relationship between environmental variation and species abundances to predict the effect of future environmental change on their distributions. However, two common assumptions of SDMs are likely to be violated in many cases: (1) that the relationship of environment with abundance or fitness is constant throughout a species range and will remain so in future, and (2) that abiotic factors (e.g. temperature, humidity) determine species distributions. We test these assumptions by relating field abundance of the rainforest fruit fly Drosophila birchii to ecological change across gradients that include its low and high altitudinal limits. We then test how such ecological variation affects the fitness of 35 D. birchii families transplanted in 591 cages to sites along two altitudinal gradients, to determine whether genetic variation in fitness responses could facilitate future adaptation to environmental change. Overall, field abundance was highest at cooler, high altitude sites, and declined towards warmer, low altitude sites. By contrast, cage fitness (productivity) increased towards warmer, lower altitude sites, suggesting that biotic interactions (absent from cages) drive ecological limits at warmer margins. In addition, the relationship between environmental variation and abundance varied significantly among gradients, indicating divergence in ecological niche across the species range. However, there was no evidence for local adaptation within gradients, despite greater productivity of high altitude than low altitude populations when families were reared under laboratory conditions. Families also responded similarly to transplantation along gradients, providing no evidence for fitness trade-offs that would favour local adaptation. These findings highlight the importance of (1) measuring genetic variation of key traits under ecologically relevant conditions, and (2) considering the effect of biotic interactions when predicting species responses to environmental change.",

    "abstract": "MotivationProtein contacts contain key information for the understanding of protein structure and function and thus, contact prediction from sequence is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not extremely useful for de novo structure prediction.\\n\\nMethodThis paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual neural networks. The first residual network conducts a series of 1-dimensional convolutional transformation of sequential features; the second residual network conducts a series of 2-dimensional convolutional transformation of pairwise information including output of the first residual network, EC information and pairwise potential. By using very deep residual networks, we can model contact occurring patterns and very complex sequence-structure relationship and thus, obtain high-quality contact prediction regardless of how many sequence homologs are available for proteins in question.\\n\\nResultsOur method greatly outperforms existing methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted folding. Tested on 105 CASP11 targets, 76 past CAMEO hard targets, and 398 membrane proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained our method, one representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints but without any force fields can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore>0.6) for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models especially for membrane proteins. The 3D models built from our contact prediction have TMscore>0.5 for 208 of the 398 membrane proteins, while those from homology modeling have TMscore>0.5 for only 10 of them. Further, even if trained by only non-membrane proteins, our deep learning method works very well on membrane protein contact prediction. In the recent blind CAMEO benchmark, our fully-automated web server implementing this method successfully folded 4 targets with a new fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs, including one {beta} protein of 182 residues, one +{beta} protein of 125 residues, one  protein of 140 residues and one  protein of 217 residues.\\n\\nAvailability: http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/ContactMap/\\n\\nAuthor SummaryProtein contact prediction from sequence alone is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem due to the development of direct evolutionary coupling analysis (DCA). However, DCA is effective on only some proteins with a very large number (>1000) of sequence homologs. To further improve contact prediction, we borrow ideas from the latest breakthrough of deep learning, a powerful machine learning technique that has recently revolutionized object recognition, speech recognition and the GO game. We have developed a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both sequence conservation and co-variation information through an ultra-deep neural network, which can model very complex relationship between sequence and contact map as well as high-order correlation among residues.\\n\\nOur test results suggest that deep learning can revolutionize protein contact prediction. Tested on 398 membrane proteins, the L/10 long-range accuracy obtained by our method is 77.6% while that by the state-of-the-art methods CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 51.8% and 61.2%, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints can generate much better 3D structural models than the other contact prediction methods. In particular, without using any force fields our predicted contacts yield correct folds for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models (TBM) built from the training proteins. For example, our contact-assisted models have TMscore>0.5 for 208 of the 398 membrane proteins while TBMs have TMscore >0.5 for only 10 of them. Even without using any membrane proteins to train our deep learning models, our method still performs very well on membrane protein contact prediction. Recent blind test of our method in CAMEO shows that our method successfully folded 4 targets with a new fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPI) are crucial for protein function. There exist many techniques to identify PPIs experimentally, but to determine the interactions in molecular detail is still difficult and very time-consuming. The fact that the number of PPIs is vastly larger than the number of individual proteins makes it practically impossible to characterize all interactions experimentally. Computational approaches that can bridge this gap and predict PPIs and model the interactions in molecular detail are greatly needed. Here we present InterPred, a fully automated pipeline that predicts and model PPIs from sequence using structural modeling combined with massive structural comparisons and molecular docking. A key component of the method is the use of a novel random forest classifier that integrate several structural features to distinguish correct from incorrect protein-protein interaction models. We show that InterPred represents a major improvement in protein-protein interaction detection with a performance comparable or better than experimental high-throughput techniques. We also show that our full-atom protein-protein complex modelling pipeline performs better than any state of the art protein docking method on a standard benchmark set.

We test a new set of primers and hybridizing long-range library (LR-HY) with 112 mitochondrial genomes (MtG) representing three orders, 12 families, 54 genera, and 106 species of Amphibia. The primers are used for obtaining wide taxonomic MtG amplicons to sequence directly and/or make probes for closely related species. LR-HY is compared to standard hybridization. The primers successfully amplify 82 MtGs from all three order, all families, 92.6% (50/54) of the genera, and 74.5% (79/106) of the species, despite some DNA degradation and gene rearrangement. We observe a significantly negative correlation between sequence depth and gene variation. The pattern of highly variable regions is separately distributed in different regions within the length of < 4 kb in the 33-pooled sample. We demonstrate that using 2 kb libraries generate deeper sequence coverage in the highly variable loci than using 400 bp libraries. In total, the pipeline successfully recovers 83 complete and 14 almost complete MtGs from 53 of 54 genera, including 14 MtGs had rearranged protein-coding genes. This universal primers combined with LR-HY is an efficient way to enrich complete MtGs across the entire Amphibia.",

    "abstract": "Investigation of the temporal trajectories of currently used neuropsychological tests is critical to identifying earliest changing measures on the path to dementia due to Alzheimers disease (AD). We used the Progression Score (PS) method to characterize the temporal trajectories of measures of verbal memory, executive function, attention, processing speed, language, and mental state using data spanning normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD from 1661 participants with a total of 7839 visits (age at last visit 77.6 SD 9.2) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and 1542 participants with a total of 4467 visits (age at last visit 59.9 SD 7.3) in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimers Prevention. This method aligns individuals in time based on the similarity of their longitudinal measurements to reveal temporal trajectories. As a validation of our methodology, we explored the associations between the individualized cognitive progression scores (Cog-PS) computed by our method and clinical diagnosis. Digit span tests were the first to show declines in both data sets, and were detected mainly among cognitively normal individuals. These were followed by tests of verbal memory, which were in turn followed by Trail Making Tests, Boston Naming Test, and Mini-Mental State Examination. Differences in Cog-PS across the clinical diagnosis groups were statistically significant, highlighting the potential use of Cog-PS as individualized indicators of disease progression. Identifying cognitive measures that are changing in preclinical AD can lead to the development of novel cognitive tests that are finely tuned to detecting earliest changes.\\n\\nABBREVIATIONS",

We used the resulting data set to show that somatic driver alterations including single nucleotide variants, focal DNA alterations, and oncogene amplification in extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) elements were in majority propagated from tumor to model systems. In several instances, ecDNAs and chromosomal alterations demonstrated divergent inheritance patterns and clonal selection dynamics during cell culture and xenografting. Longitudinal patient tumor profiling showed that oncogenic ecDNAs are frequently retained after disease recurrence. Our analysis shows that extrachromosomal elements increase the genomic heterogeneity during tumor evolution of glioblastoma, independent of chromosomal DNA alterations.",

Fluctuations in this E:I balance have been shown to influence neural computation, working memory, and information processing. While more drastic shifts and aberrant E:I patterns are implicated in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, current methods for measuring E:I dynamics require invasive procedures that are difficult to perform in behaving animals, and nearly impossible in humans. This has limited the ability to examine the full impact that E:I shifts have in neural computation and disease. In this study, we develop a computational model to show that E:I ratio can be estimated from the power law exponent (slope) of the electrophysiological power spectrum, and validate this relationship using previously published datasets from two species (rat local field potential and macaque electrocorticography). This simple method--one that can be applied retrospectively to existing data--removes a major hurdle in understanding a currently difficult to measure, yet fundamental, aspect of neural computation.",

    "abstract": "Habitat loss is the greatest threat to large carnivores around the world. Maintenance of functional connectivity in fragmented landscapes will be important for long-term species persistence. Here, we merge landscape genetics analyses and spatially-explicit simulations to understand future persistence and extinction of tigers (Panthera tigris) in Central India. Tigers in this landscape are restricted to Protected Areas (PAs) and forest fragments embedded within a mosaic of agricultural fields and human settlements. We examined current population connectivity of tigers across nine reserves (using 116 non-invasively sampled individuals and 12 microsatellites). Genetic data was used to infer resistance-to-movement. Our results suggest that dense human settlements and roads with high traffic are detrimental to tiger movement. We used landscape genetic simulations to model 86 different scenarios that incorporated impacts of future land-use change on inferred population connectivity and extinction. Our results confirm that genetic variability (heterozygosity) will decrease in the future and small and/or isolated PAs will have a high risk of local extinction. The average extinction risk of small PAs reduced by 23-70% on adding a 5 km buffer around exiting boundaries. Unplanned development results in 35% lower heterozygosity and 56% higher average extinction probability for tigers even within protected areas. Increasing tiger numbers in such a scenario decreases extinction probability just by 12 % (from 56% to 44%). Scenarios where habitat connectivity was enhanced and maintained, stepping-stone populations were introduced/maintained, and tiger numbers were increased, led to low overall extinction probability (between 3-21%). Our simulations provide a means to quantitatively evaluate the effects of different land-use change scenarios on connectivity and extinction, linking basic science to land-use change policy and planned infrastructure development.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the contextual multi-armed bandit task as a framework to investigate learning and decision making in uncertain environments. In this novel paradigm, participants repeatedly choose between multiple options in order to maximise their rewards. The options are described by a number of contextual features which are predictive of the rewards through initially unknown functions. From their experience with choosing options and observing the consequences of their decisions, participants can learn about the functional relation between contexts and rewards and improve their decision strategy over time. In three experiments, we explore participants behaviour in such learning environments. We predict participants behaviour by context-blind (mean-tracking, Kalman filter) and contextual (Gaussian process and linear regression) learning approaches combined with different choice strategies. Participants are mostly able to learn about the context-reward functions and their behaviour is best described by a Gaussian process learning strategy which generalizes previous experience to similar instances. In a relatively simple task with binary features, they seem to combine this learning with a \\\"probability of improvement\\\" decision strategy which focuses on alternatives that are expected to lead to an improvement upon a current favourite option. In a task with continuous features that are linearly related to the rewards, participants seem to more explicitly balance exploration and exploitation. Finally, in a difficult learning environment where the relation between features and rewards is non-linear, some participants are again well-described by a Gaussian process learning strategy, whereas others revert to context-blind strategies.",

    "abstract": "Functional and anatomical sexual dimorphisms in the brain are either the result of cells that are generated only in one sex, or a manifestation of sex-specific differentiation of neurons present in both sexes. The PHC neurons of the nematode C. elegans differentiate in a strikingly sex-specific manner. While in hermaphrodites the PHC neurons display a canonical pattern of synaptic connectivity similar to that of other sensory neurons, PHC differentiates into a densely connected hub sensory/interneuron in males, integrating a large number of male-specific synaptic inputs and conveying them to both male-specific and sex-shared circuitry. We describe that the differentiation into such a hub neuron involves the sex-specific scaling of several components of the synaptic vesicle machinery, including the vesicular glutamate transporter eat-4/VGLUT, induction of neuropeptide expression, changes in axonal projection morphology and a switch in neuronal function. We demonstrate that these molecular and anatomical remodeling events are controlled cell-autonomously by the phylogenetically conserved Doublesex homolog dmd-3, which is both required and sufficient for sex-specific PHC differentiation. Cellular specificity of dmd-3 action is ensured by its collaboration with non-sex specific terminal selector-type transcription factors whereas sex-specificity of dmd-3 action is ensured by the hermaphrodite-specific master regulator of hermaphroditic cell identity, the Gli-like transcription factor tra-1, which transcriptionally represses dmd-3 in hermaphrodite PHC. Taken together, our studies provide mechanistic insights into how neurons are specified in a sexually dimorphic manner.",

    "abstract": "The methods to execute biological experiments are evolving. Affordable fluid handling robots and on-demand biology enterprises are making automating entire experiments a reality. Automation offers the benefit of high-throughput experimentation, rapid prototyping and improved reproducibility of results. However, learning to automate and codify experiments is a difficult task as it requires programming expertise. Here, we present a web-based visual development environment called BioBlocks for describing experimental protocols in biology. It is based on Googles Blockly and Scratch, and requires little or no experience in computer programming to automate the execution of experiments. The experiments can be specified, saved, modified and shared between multiple users in an easy manner. BioBlocks is open-source and can be customized to execute protocols on local robotic platforms or remotely i.e. in the cloud. It aims to serve as a  de facto open standard for programming protocols in Biology.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/081075_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (51K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@108403corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b15c17org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14ed6forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f046c4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Severe environmental change can drive a population extinct unless the population adapts in time to the new conditions (\\\"evolutionary rescue\\\"). How does bi-parental sexual reproduction influence the chances of population persistence compared to clonal reproduction or selfing? In this paper, we set up a one-locus two-allele model for adaptation in diploid species, where rescue is contingent on the establishment of the mutant homozygote. Reproduction can occur by random mating, selfing, or clonally. Random mating generates and destroys the rescue mutant; selfing is efficient at generating it but at the same time depletes the heterozygote, which can lead to a low mutant frequency in the standing genetic variation and also affects the establishment probability of the mutation. Due to these antagonistic effects, we find a non-trivial dependence of population survival on the rate of sex/selfing, which is strongly affected by the dominance coefficient of the mutation before and after the environmental change. Importantly, since mating with the wildtype breaks the mutant homozygote up, a slow decay of the wildtype population size can impede rescue in randomly mating populations.",

    "abstract": "The study of whole microbial communities through RNA-seq, or metatranscriptomics, offers a unique view of the relative levels of activity for different genes across a large number of species simultaneously. To make sense of these sequencing data, it is necessary to be able to assign both taxonomic and functional identities to each sequenced read. High-quality identifications are important not only for community profiling, but to also ensure that functional assignments of sequence reads are correctly attributed to their source taxa. Such assignments allow biochemical pathways to be appropriately allocated to discrete species, enabling the capture of cross-species interactions. Typically read annotation is performed by a single alignment-based search tool such as BLAST. However, due to the vast extent of bacterial diversity, these approaches tend to be highly error prone, particularly for taxonomic assignments. Here we introduce a novel program for generating taxonomic assignments, called Gist, which integrates information from a number of machine learning methods and the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner. Uniquely Gist establishes the most appropriate weightings of methods for individual genomes, facilitating high classification accuracy on next-generation sequencing reads. We validate our approach using a synthetic metatranscriptome generator based on Flux Simulator, termed Genepuddle. Further, unlike previous taxonomic classifiers, we demonstrate the capacity of composition-based techniques to accurately inform on taxonomic origin without resorting to longer scanning windows that mimic alignment-based methods.

Using a novel model of neural event dynamics, we investigate how cortical structures generate event representations during continuous narratives, and how these events are stored and retrieved from long-term memory. Our data-driven approach enables identification of event boundaries and event correspondences across datasets without human-generated stimulus annotations, and reveals that different regions segment narratives at different timescales. We also provide the first direct evidence that narrative event boundaries in high-order areas (overlapping the default mode network) trigger encoding processes in the hippocampus, and that this encoding activity predicts pattern reinstatement during recall. Finally, we demonstrate that these areas represent abstract, multimodal situation models, and show anticipatory event reinstatement as subjects listen to a familiar narrative. Our results provide strong evidence that brain activity is naturally structured into semantically meaningful events, which are stored in and retrieved from long-term memory.",

    "abstract": "Atlases provide a framework for information from diverse sources to be spatially mapped and integrated into a common reference space. In particular, brain atlases allow regional annotation of gene expression, cell morphology, connectivity and activity. In larval zebrafish, advances in genetics, imaging and computational methods have enabled the collection of large datasets providing such information on a whole-brain scale. However, datasets from different sources may not be aligned to the same spatial coordinate system, because technical considerations may necessitate use of different reference templates. Two recent brain atlases for larval zebrafish exemplify this problem. The Z-Brain atlas contains information on gene expression, neural activity and neuroanatomical segmentation acquired using immunohistochemical staining of fixed tissue. In contrast, the Zebrafish Brain Browser (ZBB) atlas was constructed from live scans of fluorescent reporter genes in transgenic larvae. Although different reference brains were used, the two atlases included several transgene patterns in common that provided potential 'bridges' for transforming each into the others coordinate space. We therefore tested multiple bridging channels and registration algorithms. The symmetric diffeomorphic normalization (SyN) algorithm in ANTs improved the precision of live brain registration while better preserving cell morphology than the previously used B-spline elastic registration algorithm. SyN could also be calibrated to correct for tissue distortion introduced during fixation and permeabilization. Finally, multi-reference channel optimization provided a transformation matrix that enabled Z-Brain and ZBB to be co-aligned with acceptable precision and minimal perturbation of cell and tissue morphology. This study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating whole brain datasets, despite disparate acquisition protocols and reference templates, when sufficient information is present for bridging.\\n\\nAnatomical abbreviations",

    "abstract": "Learning how to actively avoid a predictable aversive stimulus involves two steps: recognizing the cue that predicts upcoming punishment, and learning a behavioral response that will lead to avoidance. In zebrafish, ventral habenula (vHb) neurons have been proposed to participate in both steps by encoding the expected aversiveness of a stimulus. vHb neurons increase their firing rate as expectation of punishment grows, but reduce their activity as avoidance learning occurs. How the change in vHb activity occurs is not known. Here, we ask whether the neuromodulator kisspeptin1, which is expressed in the ventral habenula, could be involved. Kiss1 mutants were generated with Cas9 using guide RNAs targeted to the signal sequence. Mutants, which have a stop codon upstream of the kisspeptin1 peptide, have a deficiency in learning to avoid a shock that is predicted by light. Electrophysiology indicates that kisspeptin1 has a concentration-dependent effect on vHb neurons: depolarizing at low concentrations and hyperpolarizing at high concentrations. These data suggest that as the fish learns to cope with a threat, kisspeptin1 may differentially modulate vHb neurons. This implies that learning a behavioral strategy to overcome a stressor is accompanied by physiological change in habenula neurons.\\n\\nSignificance statementLearning to deal with adversity can positively affect ones ability to cope with challenges in the immediate future. Control thus causes short-term change in the brain. Here, we show that the neuromodulator kisspeptin1 is required to learn to avoid a punishment. Expression and electrophysiological recordings suggest that this molecule functions by controlling the ventral habenula, a region of the brain that mediates fear by regulating serotonin release. Kisspeptin1 may be a potential player in resilience developed as a result of control, extending previous findings that it can reduce fear.",

A list of kinase substrates was compiled and used to estimate changes in kinase activities using the following methods: Z-test, Kolmogorov Smirnov test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and a multiple linear regression model (MLR). We also tested weighted variants of the Z-test, and GSEA that include information on kinase sequence specificity as proxy for affinity. Finally, we tested how the number of known substrates and the type of evidence (in vivo, in vitro or in silico) supporting these influence the predictions.\\n\\nConclusionsMost models performed well with the Z-test and the GSEA performing best as determined by the area under the ROc curve (Mean AUC=0.722).

Here, we investigated a latitudinal cline in growth and photosynthesis across 16 populations of the perennial herb Erythranthe cardinalis (Phrymaceae). Using machine learning methods, we identify interannual variation in precipitation as a likely selective agent: Southern populations from more variable environments had higher photosynthetic rates and grew faster. We hypothesize that selection may favor a more annualized life history - grow now rather than save for next year - in environments where severe droughts occur more often.

A growing number of tools enable discovery of gene fusions from RNA-seq data. However it is likely that not all gene fusions are driving tumors. Assessing the potential functional consequences of a fusion is critical to understand their driver role. It is also challenging as gene fusions are described by chromosomal breakpoint coordinates that need to be translated into an actual amino acid fusion sequence and predicted domain architecture of the fusion proteins. Currently there are no easy-to-use tools that can automatically reconstruct and visualize fusion proteins from genomic breakpoints. To facilitate the functional interpretation of gene fusions, we developed AGFusion, available as an online web tool that can be readily used by non-computational researchers as well as a python package that can be built into computational pipelines. With minimal input from the user, AGFusion predicts the cDNA, CDS, and protein sequences of all gene fusion products based on all combinations of gene isoforms. For protein coding fusions, AGFusion can annotate and visualize the protein domain architecture.

    "abstract": "Although the failure of cancers treatments has been mostly linked with the existence of resistant cells or cancer stem cells, new findings show a significant correlation between circulating inflammatory biomarkers and treatment failures. Most cancer treatments cause necrotic cell deaths in the tumor microenvironment. Necrotic cells send signals to the immune cells to start the wound healing process in the tissue. Therefore, we assume after stopping treatments there is a wound that needs to be healed. The stochastic simulations of epithelial cell dynamics after a treatment, which only kills cells without changing the tumors inflammatory environment, show that higher fitness of cancer cells causes earlier relapses. Moreover, the tumor returns even if a single cancer cell with high fitness remains in the wounds boundary after such treatments. Although the involvement of cancer cells in the wound healing after treatments lead to the fast relapse, the cancer cells outside of the wound can also cause a slow recurrence of the tumor. Therefore, the absence of relapse after such treatments implies a slow-developing tumor that might not reach an observable size in the patients life time. Conversely, a large solid tumor in a young patient suggests the presence of high fitness cancer cells and therefore a high likelihood of relapse after conventional therapies. Additionally, the location of remaining cancer cells after treatments is a very important factor in the recurrence time. The fastest recurrence happens when a high fitness cancer cell is located in the middle of the wound. However, the longest time to recurrence corresponds to cancer cells located outside of the wounds boundary.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian Mcm-domain containing 2 (Mcmdc2) gene encodes a protein of unknown function that is homologous to the mini-chromosome maintenance family of DNA replication licensing and helicase factors. Drosophila melanogaster contains two separate genes, the \\\"Mei-MCMs,\\\" that appear to have arisen from a single ancestral Mcmdc2 gene. The Mei-MCMs are involved in promoting meiotic crossovers by blocking the anti-crossover activity of BLM helicase, a function performed by MSH4 and MSH5 in metazoans. Here, we report that MCMDC2-deficient mice of both sexes are viable but sterile. Males fail to produce spermatozoa, and formation of primordial follicles is disrupted in females. Histology and immunocytological analyses of mutant testes revealed that meiosis is arrested in Prophase I, and is characterized by persistent meiotic double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs), failure of homologous chromosome synapsis and XY body formation, and an absence of crossing over. These phenotypes essentially phenocopy those of MSH4/5 deficient meiocytes. The data indicate that MCMDC2 is essential for invasion of homologous sequences by RAD51- and DMC1-coated ssDNA filaments, or stabilization of recombination intermediates following strand invasion, both of which are needed to drive stable homolog pairing and DSB repair via recombination in mice.",

    "abstract": "SummaryO_LIWildlife surveys are often used to estimate the density, abundance, or distribution of animal populations. Recently, model-based approaches to analyzing survey data have become popular because one can more readily accommodate departures from pre-planned survey routes and construct more detailed maps than one can with design-based procedures.\\nC_LIO_LISpecies distribution models fitted to wildlife survey data often make the implicit assumption that locations chosen for sampling and animal abundance at those locations are conditionally independent given modeled covariates. However, this assumption is likely violated in many cases when survey effort is non-randomized, leading to preferential sampling.\\nC_LIO_LIWe develop a hierarchical statistical modeling framework for detecting and alleviating the biasing effects of preferential sampling in species distribution models fitted to count data. The approach works by jointly modeling wildlife state variables and the locations selected for sampling, and specifying a dependent correlation structure between the two models.\\nC_LIO_LIUsing simulation, we show that moderate levels of preferential sampling can lead to large (e.g. 40%) bias in estimates of animal density, and that our modeling approach can considerably reduce this bias.\\nC_LIO_LIWe apply our approach to aerial survey counts of bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) in the eastern Bering Sea. Models that included a preferential sampling effect led to lower estimates of abundance than models without, but the effect size of the preferential sampling parameter decreased in models that included explanatory environmental covariates.\\nC_LIO_LIWhen wildlife surveys are conducted without a well-defined sampling frame, ecologists should recognize the potentially biasing effects of preferential sampling. Joint models, such as those described in this paper, can be used to test and correct for such biases. Predictive covariates are also useful for bias reduction, but ultimately the best way to avoid preferential sampling bias is to incorporate design-based principles such as randomization and/or systematic sampling into survey design.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Brain decoders use neural recordings to infer a users activity or intent. To train a decoder, we generally need infer the variables of interest (covariates) using simultaneously measured neural activity. However, there are many cases where this approach is not possible. Here we overcome this problem by introducing a fundamentally new approach for decoding called distribution alignment decoding (DAD). We use the statistics of movement, much like cryptographers use the statistics of language, to find a mapping between neural activity and motor variables. DAD learns a linear decoder which aligns the distribution of its output with the typical distribution of motor outputs by minimizing their KL-divergence. We apply our approach to a two datasets collected from the motor cortex of non-human primates (NHPs): a reaching task and an isometric force production task. We study the performance of DAD and find regimes where DAD provides comparable and in some cases, better performance than a typical supervised decoder. As DAD does not rely on the ability to record motor-related outputs, it promises to broaden the set of potential applications of brain decoding.",

    "abstract": "Migration of stem cells underpins the physiology of metazoan animals. For tissues to be maintained, stem cells and their progeny must migrate and differentiate in the correct positions. This need is even more acute after tissue damage by wounding or pathogenic infections. Inappropriate migration also underpins the formation of metastasis. Despite this, few mechanistic studies address stem cell migration during repair or homeostasis in adult tissues. Here, we present a shielded X-ray irradiation assay that allows us to follow stem cell migration in the planarians. We demonstrate that we can use this system to study the molecular control of stem cell migration and show that snail and zeb-1 EMT transcription factors homologs are necessary for cell migration to wound sites and for the establishment of migratory cell morphology. Our work establishes planarians as a suitable model for further in depth study of the processes controlling stem cell migration in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The focus of the computational structural biology community has taken a dramatic shift over the past one-and-a-half decades from the classical protein structure prediction problem to the possible understanding of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) or proteins containing regions of disorder (IDPR). The current interest lies in the unraveling of a disorder-to-order transitioning code embedded in the amino acid sequences of IDPs / IDPRs. Disordered proteins are characterized by an enormous amount of structural plasticity which makes them promiscuous in binding to different partners, multi-functional in cellular activity and atypical in folding energy landscapes resembling partially folded molten globules. Also, their involvement in several deadly human diseases (e.g. cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases) makes them attractive drug targets, and important for a biochemical understanding of the disease(s). The study of the structural ensemble of IDPs is rather difficult, in particular for transient interactions. When bound to a structured partner, an IDPR adapts an ordered conformation in the complex. The residues that undergo this disorder-to-order transition are called protean residues, generally found in short contiguous stretches and the first step in understanding the modus operandi of an IDP / IDPR would be to predict these residues. There are a few available methods which predict these protean segments from their amino acid sequences; however, their performance reported in the literature leaves clear room for improvement. With this background, the current study presents 'Proteus', a random forest classifier that predicts the likelihood of a residue undergoing a disorder-to-order transition upon binding to a potential partner protein. The prediction is based on features that can be calculated using the amino acid sequence alone. Proteus compares favorably with existing methods predicting twice as many true positives as the second best method (55% vs. 27%) with a much higher precision on an independent data set. The current study also sheds some light on a possible 'disorder-to-order' transitioning consensus, untangled, yet embedded in the amino acid sequence of IDPs. Some guidelines have also been suggested for proceeding with a real-life structural modeling involving an IDPR using Proteus.\\n\\nSoftware Availabilityhttps://github.com/bjornwallner/proteus",

However, existing theory assumes that organisms cannot detect changes in the environment and instead adapt to averages. This paper develops the first analytical model that allows for the simultaneous coevolution of socially learned traditions, reliance on social learning, and signal detection for environmental change. There are numerous conditions under which detection can be stable once common but cannot invade the population when rare. When signal detection is maintained by selection, it always leads to pure separating equilibria at which organisms always learn individually when they believe the environment has recently changed and otherwise always learn socially. Detection can increase mean fitness at equilibrium, but it may also reduce it.",

Large-scale monocultures are prone to bio-contamination, however, little is known about the identity of the invading organisms. To gain insight into the bacterial community associated with diatoms, we translated the complexity of a natural system into reproducible experiments where we investigated the microbiome of P. tricornutum cultures. The results revealed a dynamic bacterial community that changed over time and in differing media conditions. We propose a network of putative interactions between P. tricornutum and the main bacterial factions, which is translated into a set of ordinary differential equations constituting a computational dynamic model. The proposed mathematical model is able to capture the population dynamics, further supporting the hypothesised interactions. The interdisciplinary approach implemented provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of diatom-associated microbial communities, and provides a foundation for further systematic investigations of host-microbe interactions.",

However, brain regions encode information in multivariate responses, and neural computations are nonlinear. Multivariate and nonlinear statistical dependence between regions is likely ubiquitous, but it is not captured by current methods. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel analysis framework: fMRI responses are characterized as points in multidimensional spaces, and nonlinear dependence is modeled using artificial neural networks. Converging evidence from multiple experiments shows that nonlinear dependence 1) models mappings between brain regions more accurately than linear dependence, explaining more variance in left-out data; 2) reveals functional subdivisions within cortical networks, and 3) is modulated by the task participants are performing.",
