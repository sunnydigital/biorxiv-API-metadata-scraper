    "abstract": "Identification of drug targets and mechanism of action (MoA) for new and uncharacterlzed drugs is important for optimization of drug efficacy. Current MoA prediction approaches largely rely on prior information including side effects, therapeutic indication and/or chemo-informatics. Such information is not transferable or applicable for newly identified, previously uncharacterlzed small molecules. Therefore, a shift in the paradigm of MoA predictions is necessary towards development of unbiased approaches that can elucidate drug relationships and efficiently classify new compounds with basic input data. We propose a new integrative computational pharmacogenomlc approach, referred to as Drug Network Fusion (DNF), to infer scalable drug taxonomies that relies only on basic drug characteristics towards elucidating drug-drug relationships. DNF is the first framework to integrate drug structural information, high-throughput drug perturbation and drug sensitivity profiles, enabling drug classification of new experimental compounds with minimal prior information. We demonstrate that the DNF taxonomy succeeds in identifying pertinent and novel drug-drug relationships, making it suitable for investigating experimental drugs with potential new targets or MoA. We highlight how the scalability of DNF facilitates identification of key drug relationships across different drug categories, and poses as a flexible tool for potential clinical applications in precision medicine. Our results support DNF as a valuable resource to the cancer research community by providing new hypotheses on the compound MoA and potential insights for drug repurposlng.",

    "abstract": "Although a large number of clustering algorithms have been proposed to identify groups of co-expressed genes from microarray data, the question of if and how such methods may be applied to RNA-seq data remains unaddressed. In this work, we investigate the use of data transformations in conjunction with Gaussian mixture models for RNA-seq co-expression analyses, as well as a penalized model selection criterion to select both an appropriate transformation and number of clusters present in the data. This approach has the advantage of accounting for per-cluster correlation structures among samples, which can be quite strong in RNA-seq data. In addition, it provides a rigorous statistical framework for parameter estimation, an objective assessment of data transformations and number of clusters, and the possibility of performing diagnostic checks on the quality and homogeneity of the identified clusters. We analyze four varied RNA-seq datasets to illustrate the use of transformations and model selection in conjunction with Gaussian mixture models. Finally, we propose an R package coseq (co-expression of RNA-seq data) to facilitate implementation and visualization of the recommended RNA-seq co-expression analyses.",

    "abstract": "Herbivore selection of plant hosts and plant responses to insect colonization have been subjects of intense investigations. A growing body of evidence suggests that for successful colonization to occur, (effector/virulence) proteins in insect saliva must modulate plant defense responses to the benefit of the insect. A range of insect saliva proteins that modulate plant defense responses have been identified, but there is no direct evidence that these proteins are delivered into specific plant tissues and enter plant cells. Aphids and other sap-sucking insects of the order Hemiptera use their specialized mouthparts (stylets) to probe plant mesophyll cells, until they reach the phloem cells for long-term feeding. Here we show by immunogold-labeling of ultrathin sections of aphid feeding sites that an immuno-suppressive aphid effector localizes in the cytoplasm of mesophyll cells near aphid stylets, but not in cells further away from aphid feeding sites. In contrast, another aphid effector protein localizes in the sheaths composed of gelling saliva that surround the aphid stylets. Thus, insects deliver effectors directly into plant tissue. Moreover, different aphid effectors locate extracellularly in the sheath saliva or are introduced into the cytoplasm of plant cells.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system provides unprecedented genome editing capabilities. However, off-target effects lead to sub-optimal usage and additionally are a bottleneck in development of therapeutic uses. Herein, we introduce the first machine learning-based approach to this problem, yielding a state-of-the-art predictive model for CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects which outperforms all other guide design services. Our approach, Elevation, consists of two inter-related machine learning models--one for scoring individual guide-target pairs and another which aggregates guide-target scores into a single, overall guide summary score. Through systematic investigation, we demonstrate that Elevation performs substantially better than competing approaches on both of these tasks. Additionally, we are the first to systematically evaluate approaches on the guide summary score problem; we show that the most widely-used method (and one re-implemented by several other servers) performs no better than random at times, whereas Elevation consistently outperformed it, sometimes by an order of magnitude. In our analyses, we also introduce a method to balance errors on truly active guides with those which are truly inactive, encapsulating a range of practical use cases, thereby showing that Elevation is consistently superior across the entire range. We thus contribute a new evaluation metric for benchmarking off-target modeling. Finally, because of the large computational demands of our tasks, we have developed a cloud-based service for end-to-end guide design which incorporates our previously reported on-target model, Azimuth, as well as our new off-target model, Elevation.",

    "abstract": "Giardia lamblia is the most prevalent protistan parasite, causing acute and chronic diarrheal disease in over one billion people worldwide. Vertebrate hosts ingest Giardia cysts from contaminated sources, and these cysts excyst in the gut to become motile trophozoites. Trophozoites colonize the small intestine by attaching to the intestinal villi and later differentiate into infectious cysts that are released into the environment, completing Giardias life cycle. Due to the limited accessibility of the gastrointestinal tract, our understanding of in in vivo temporal and spatial dynamics of giardiasis is largely inferred from parasite physiology in laboratory culture. Yet parasite growth under in vitro culture conditions may not mirror in vivo parasite physiology in the host. Here we develop bioluminescent imaging (BLI) methods to directly interrogate the temporal and spatial dynamics of giardiasis in mice, providing an improved animal model for the evaluation of anti-Giardia drugs. This non-invasive method of imaging giardiasis allows unprecedented and precise quantification of in vivo temporal and spatial patterns of infection. By infecting mice with parasites expressing constitutive or encystation-specific luciferase bioreporters, we show that parasite colonization of the gut is not uniform. Metabolically active parasites primarily colonize the proximal small intestine in \\\"hot spots\\\"--high density foci of infection that likely result in localized pathology to the gut epithelium. Using in vivo and ex vivo BLI of encystation-specific bioreporters, we show that encystation initiates shortly after inoculation and parasites encyst throughout the entire duration of infection. We also find that encystation is initiated in high density foci in the proximal small intestine, rather than the colon as has been previously assumed, and show that the initiation of encystation is magnified in parasites incubated at high density in laboratory culture. Prior models have suggested that chemical cues cause parasites to encyst as they are dislodged from the upper gut and travel to more distal regions of the gastrointestinal tract. We suggest a model of encystation in which parasites reach a threshold density that results the induction of encystation due to local nutrient depletion. The in vivo imaging of giardiasis has redefined the dynamics of the Giardia life cycle in the host, paving the way for future mechanistic studies of density-dependent processes in this highly prevalent, yet understudied parasite.",

    "abstract": "The alternative sigma factor RpoS is a central regulator of a many stress responses in Escherichia coli. The level of functional RpoS differs depending on the stress. The effect of these differing concentrations of RpoS on global transcriptional responses remains unclear. We investigated the effect of RpoS concentration on the transcriptome during stationary phase in rich media. We show that 23% of genes in the E. coli genome are regulated by RpoS level, and we identify many RpoS-transcribed genes and promoters. We observe three distinct classes of response to RpoS by genes in the regulon: genes whose expression changes linearly with increasing RpoS level, genes whose expression changes dramatically with the production of only a little RpoS (\\\"sensitive\\\" genes), and genes whose expression changes very little with the production of a little RpoS (\\\"insensitive\\\"). We show that sequences outside the core promoter region determine whether a RpoS-regulated gene in sensitive or insensitive. Moreover, we show that sensitive and insensitive genes are enriched for specific functional classes, and that the sensitivity of a gene to RpoS corresponds to the timing of induction as cells enter stationary phase. Thus, promoter sensitivity to RpoS is a mechanism to coordinate specific cellular processes with growth phase, and may also contribute to the diversity of stress responses directed by RpoS.\\n\\nImportanceThe sigma factor RpoS is a global regulator that controls the response to many stresses in Escherichia coli. Different stresses result in different levels of RpoS production, but the consequences of this variation are unknown. We describe how changing the level of RpoS does not influence all RpoS-regulated genes equally. The cause of this variation is likely the action of transcription factors that bind the promoters of the genes. We show that the sensitivity of a gene to RpoS levels explains the timing of expression as cells enter stationary phase, and that genes with different RpoS sensitivities are enriched for specific functional groups. Thus, promoter sensitivity to RpoS is a mechanism to coordinate specific cellular processes in response to stresses.",

Here, we investigate the evolution of social behavior in structured populations under arbitrary mutation probabilities. We consider populations of fixed size N, structured such that in the absence of selection, all individuals have the same probability of reproducing or dying (neutral reproductive values are the all same). Two types of individuals, A and B, corresponding to two types of social behavior, are competing; the fidelity of strategy transmission from parent to offspring is tuned by a parameter . Social interactions have a direct effect on individual fecundities. Under the assumption of small phenotypic differences (implyingweak selection), we provide a formula for the expected frequency of type A individuals in the population, and deduce conditions for the long-term success of one strategy against another. We then illustrate our results with three common life-cycles (Wright-Fisher, Moran Birth-Death and Moran Death-Birth), and specific population structures (graph-structured populations). Qualitatively, we find that some life-cycles (Moran Birth-Death, Wright-Fisher) prevent the evolution of altruistic behavior, confirming previous results obtained with perfect strategy transmission. We also show that computing the expected frequency of altruists on a regular graph may require knowing more than just the graphs size and degree.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is a highly conserved and essential behaviour in many species, including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In the wild, sensory signalling encoding environmental information must be integrated with sleep drive to ensure that sleep is not initiated during detrimental conditions. However, the molecular and circuit mechanisms by which sleep timing is modulated by the environment are unclear. Here we introduce a novel behavioural paradigm to study this issue. We show that in male fruit flies, onset of the daytime siesta is delayed by ambient temperatures above 29{degrees}C. We term this effect Prolonged Morning Wakefulness (PMW). We show that signalling through the TrpA1 thermo-sensor is required for PMW, and that TrpA1 specifically impacts siesta onset, but not night sleep onset, in response to elevated temperatures. We identify two critical TrpA1-expressing circuits and show that both contact DN1p clock neurons, the output of which is also required for PMW. Finally, we identify the circadian blue-light photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME as a molecular regulator of PMW. We propose a model in which the Drosophila nervous system integrates information encoding temperature, light, and time to dynamically control when sleep is initiated. Our results provide a platform to investigate how environmental inputs co-ordinately regulate sleep plasticity.",

    "abstract": "The chemical, physical and mechanical properties of the extra-cellular environment have a strong effect on cell migration. Aspects such as pore-size or stiffness of the matrix influence the selection of the mechanism used by cells to propel themselves, including pseudopod or blebbing. How a cell perceives its environment, and how such a cue triggers a change in behaviour are largely unknown, but mechanics is likely to be involved. Because mechanical conditions are often controlled by modifying the composition of the environment, separating chemical and physical contributions is difficult and requires multiple controls. Here we propose a simple method to impose a mechanical compression on individual cells without altering the composition of the gel. Live imaging during compression provides accurate information about the cells morphology and migratory phenotype. Using Dictyostelium as a model, we observe that a compression of the order of 500 Pa flattens the cells under gel by up to 50%. This uniaxial compression directly triggers a transition in the mode of migration, from primarily pseudopodial to bleb driven, in less than 30 sec. This novel device is therefore capable of influencing cell migration in real time and offers a convenient approach to systematically study mechanotransduction in confined environments.",

    "abstract": "When sensory feedback is perturbed, accurate movement is restored by a combination of implicit processes and deliberate re-aiming to strategically compensate for errors. Here, we directly compare two methods used previously to dissociate implicit from explicit learning on a trial-by-trial basis: 1) asking participants to report the direction that they aim their movements, and contrasting this with the directions of the target and the movement that they actually produce, 2) manipulating movement preparation time. By instructing participants to re-aim without a sensory perturbation, we show that re-aiming is possible even with the shortest possible preparation times, particularly when targets are narrowly distributed. Nonetheless, re-aiming is effortful and comes at the cost of increased variability, so we tested whether constraining preparation time is sufficient to suppress strategic re-aiming during adaptation to visuomotor rotation with a broad target distribution. The rate and extent of error reduction under preparation time constraints were similar to estimates of implicit learning obtained from self-report without time pressure, suggesting that participants chose not to apply a re-aiming strategy to correct visual errors under time pressure. Surprisingly, participants who reported aiming directions showed less implicit learning according to an alternative measure, obtained during trials performed without visual feedback. This suggests that the process of reporting can affect the extent or persistence of implicit learning. The data extend existing evidence that restricting preparation time can suppress explicit re-aiming, and provide an estimate of implicit visuomotor rotation learning that does not require participants to report their aiming directions.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyDuring sensorimotor adaptation, implicit, error-driven learning can be isolated from explicit strategy-driven re-aiming by subtracting self-reported aiming directions from movement directions, or by restricting movement preparation time. Here, we compared the two methods. Restricting preparation times did not eliminate re-aiming, but was sufficient to suppress reaiming during adaptation with widely-distributed targets. The self-report method produced a discrepancy in implicit learning estimated by subtracting aiming directions, and implicit learning measured in no-feedback trials.",

    "abstract": "Dyslexia is a prevalent reading disability whose underlying mechanisms are still disputed. We studied the neural mechanisms underlying dyslexia using a simple frequency-discrimination task. Though participants were asked to compare the 2-tones in each trial, implicit memory of previous trials affected their responses. We hypothesized that implicit memory decays faster among dyslexics. We tested this by increasing the temporal intervals between consecutive trials, and measuring the behavioral impact and ERP responses from the auditory cortex. Dyslexics showed a faster decay of implicit memory effects on both measures, with similar time constants. Finally, faster decay also characterized dyslexics benefits in oral reading rate. It decreased faster as a function of the time interval from the previous reading of the same non-word. We propose that dyslexics shorter neural adaptation paradoxically accounts for their longer reading times, since it induces noisier and less reliable predictions for both simple and complex stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Large scale efforts to sequence whole human genomes provide extensive data on the non-coding portion of the genome. We used variation information from 11,257 human genomes to describe the spectrum of sequence conservation in the population. We established the genome-wide variability for each nucleotide in the context of the surrounding sequence in order to identify departure from expectation at the population level (context-dependent conservation). We characterized the population diversity for functional elements in the genome and identified the coordination of conserved sequences of distal and cis enhancers, chromatin marks, promoters, coding and intronic regions. The most context-dependent conserved regions of the genome are associated with unique functional annotations and a genomic organization that spreads up to one megabase. Importantly, these regions are enriched by over 100-fold of non-coding pathogenic variants. This analysis of human genetic diversity thus provides a detailed view of sequence conservation, functional constraint and genomic organization of the human genome. Specifically, it identifies highly conserved non-coding sequences that are not captured by analysis of interspecies conservation and are greatly enriched in disease variants.",

    "abstract": "MotivationDifferent ChIP-seq peak callers often produce different output results from the same input. Since different peak callers are known to produce differentially enriched peaks with a large variance in peak length distribution and total peak count, accurately annotating peak lists with their nearest genes can be an arduous process. Functional genomic annotation of histone modification ChIP-seq data can be a particularly challenging task, as chromatin marks that have inherently broad peaks with a diffuse range of signal enrichment (e.g., H3K9me1, H3K27me3) differ significantly from narrow peaks that exhibit a compact and localized enrichment pattern (e.g., H3K4me3, H3K9ac). In addition, varying degrees of tissue-dependent broadness of an epigenetic mark can make it difficult to accurately and reliably link sequencing data to biological function. Thus, there exists an unmet need to develop a software program that can precisely tailor the computational analysis of a ChIP-seq dataset to the specific peak coordinates of the data and its surrounding genomic features.\\n\\nResultsgeneXtendeR optimizes the functional annotation of ChIP-seq peaks by exploring relative differences in annotating ChIP-seq peak sets to variable-length gene bodies. In contrast to prior techniques, geneXtendeR considers peak annotations beyond just the closest gene, allowing users to investigate peak summary statistics for the first-closest gene, second-closest gene, ..., nth-closest gene whilst ranking the output according to biologically relevant events and iteratively comparing the fidelity of peak-to-gene overlap across a user-defined range of upstream and downstream extensions on the original boundaries of each genes coordinates. We tested geneXtendeR on 547 human transcription factor ChIP-seq ENCODE datasets and 198 human histone modification ChIP-seq ENCODE datasets, providing the analysis results as case studies.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe geneXtendeR R/Bioconductor package (including detailed introductory vignettes) is available under the GPL-3 Open Source license and is freely available to download from Bioconductor at: https://bioconductor.org/packages/geneXtendeR/\\n\\nAuthor summarygeneXtendeR makes functional annotation of ChIP-seq data more robust and precise, regardless of peak variability attributable to parameter tuning or peak caller algorithmic differences. Since different ChIP-seq peak callers produce differentially enriched peaks with large variance in peak length distribution and total peak count, annotating peak lists with their nearest genes can often be a noisy process where an adjacent second or third-closest gene may constitute a more viable biological candidate, e.g., during cases of linked genes that are located close to each other. As such, the goal of geneXtendeR is to robustly link differentially enriched peaks with their respective genes, thereby aiding experimental follow-up and validation in designing primers for a set of prospective gene candidates during qPCR.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin Assembly Factor 1 (CAF-1) deposits histones during DNA synthesis. The p150 subunit of human CAF-1 contains an N-terminal domain (p150N) that is dispensable for histone deposition but which promotes the localization of specific loci (Nucleolar-Associated Domains, or \\\"NADs\\\") and proteins to the nucleolus during interphase. One of the p150N-regulated proteins is proliferation antigen Ki-67, whose depletion also decreases the nucleolar association of NADs. Ki-67 is also a fundamental component of the perichromosomal layer (PCL), a sheath of proteins surrounding condensed chromosomes during mitosis. We show here that a subset of p150 localizes to the PCL during mitosis, and that p150N is required for normal levels of Ki-67 accumulation on the PCL. This activity requires the Sumoylation Interacting Motif (SIM) within p150N, which is also required for the nucleolar localization of NADs and Ki-67 during interphase. In this manner, p150N coordinates both interphase and mitotic nuclear structures via Ki67.",

    "abstract": "Scientists use high-dimensional measurement assays to detect and prioritize regions of strong signal in a spatially organized domain. Examples include finding methylation enriched genomic regions using microarrays and identifying active cortical areas using brain-imaging. The most common procedure for detecting potential regions is to group together neighboring sites where the signal passed a threshold. However, one needs to account for the selection bias induced by this opportunistic procedure to avoid diminishing effects when generalizing to a population. In this paper, we present a model and a method that permit population inference for these detected regions. In particular, we provide non-asymptotic point and confidence interval estimates for mean effect in the region, which account for the local selection bias and the non-stationary covariance that is typical of these data. Such summaries allow researchers to better compare regions of different sizes and different correlation structures. Inference is provided within a conditional one-parameter exponential family for each region, with truncations that match the constraints of selection. A secondary screening-and-adjustment step allows pruning the set of detected regions, while controlling the false-coverage rate for the set of regions that are reported. We illustrate the benefits of the method by applying it to detected genomic regions with differing DNA-methylation rates across tissue types. Our method is shown to provide superior power compared to non-parametric approaches.",

    "abstract": "Bee foragers respond to complex visual, olfactory, and extrasensory cues to optimize searches for floral rewards. Their abilities to detect and distinguish floral colors, shapes, volatiles, and ultraviolet signals, and even gauge nectar availability from changes in floral humidity or electric fields are well studied. Bee foraging behaviors in the absence of floral cues, however, are rarely considered. We observed forty-four species of wild bees visiting inconspicuous, non-flowering shrubs during early spring in a protected, Mediterranean habitat. We determined experimentally that these bees were accessing sugary honeydew secretions from scale insects without the aid of standard cues. While honeydew use is known among some social Hymenoptera, its use across a diverse community of mostly solitary bees is a novel observation. The widespread ability of native bees to locate and use unadvertised, non-floral sugars suggests unappreciated sensory mechanisms and/or the existence of a social foraging network among solitary bees that may influence how native bee communities cope with increasing environmental change.",

Our \\\"Cold Genome\\\" hypothesis postulates that speciation and TEs activity are strongly related in mammals. In order to test this hypothesis, we created two new parameters: the Density of Insertion (DI) and the Relative Rate of Speciation (RRS). The DI is the ratio between the number of TE insertions in a genome and its size, whereas the RRS is a conditional parameter designed to identify potential speciation bursts. Thus, by analyzing TEs insertions in mammals, we defined the genomes as \\\"hot\\\" (low DI) and \\\"cold\\\" (high DI). Then, comparing TEs activity among 16 intra-order pairs of mammalian species, 4 superorders of Eutheria and 29 taxonomical families of the whole Mammalia class, we showed that taxa with positive RRS correlate with \\\"hot\\\" genomes, whereas taxa with negative RRS correlate with \\\"cold\\\" genomes.

    "abstract": "Experiments examining the social dynamics of bacterial quorum sensing (QS) have focused on mutants which do not respond to signals, and the role of QS-regulated exoproducts as public goods. The potential for QS signal molecules to themselves be social public goods has received much less attention. Here, we analyse how signal-deficient (lasI-) mutants of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa interact with wild-type cells in an environment where QS is required for growth. We show that when growth requires a  private intracellular metabolic mechanism activated by the presence of QS signal, lasI- mutants act as social cheats and outcompete signal-producing wild-type bacteria in mixed cultures, because they can use the signals produced by wild type cells. However, reducing the ability of signal molecules to diffuse through the growth medium, results in signal molecules becoming less accessible to mutants, leading to reduced cheating. Our results indicate that QS signal molecules can be considered as social public goods in a way that has been previously described for other exoproducts, but that spatial structuring of populations reduces exploitation by non-cooperative signal cheats.\\n\\nImportanceBacteria communicate via signaling molecules to regulate the expression of a whole range of genes. This process, termed quorum sensing (QS), moderates bacterial metabolism in many environmental conditions, from soil and water (where QS-regulated genes influence nutrient cycling) to animal hosts (where QS-regulated genes determine pathogen virulence). Understanding the ecology of QS could therefore yield vital clues as to how we might modify bacterial behaviour for environmental or clinical gains. Here, we demonstrate that QS signals act as shareable public goods. This means that their evolution, and therefore population-level responses to interference with QS, will be constrained by population structure. Further, we show that environmental structure (constraints on signal diffusion) alters the accessibility of QS signals and demonstrates that we need to consider population and environmental structure to help us further our understanding of QS signaling systems.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome starts to be shaped in the first days of life and continues to increase its diversity during the first months. Several investigations are assessing the link between the configuration of the infant gut microbiome and infant health, but a comprehensive strain-level assessment of vertically transmitted microbes from mother to infant is still missing. We longitudinally collected fecal and breast milk samples from multiple mother-infant pairs during the first year of life, and applied shotgun metagenomic sequencing followed by strain-level profiling. We observed several specific strains including those from Bifidobacterium bifidum, Coprococcus comes, and Ruminococcus bromii, that were present in samples from the same mother-infant pair, while being clearly distinct from those carried by other pairs, which is indicative of vertical transmission. We further applied metatranscriptomics to study the in vivo expression of vertically transmitted microbes, for example Bacteroides vulgatus and Bifidobacterium spp., thus suggesting that transmitted strains are functionally active in the two rather different environments of the adult and infant guts. By combining longitudinal microbiome sampling and newly developed computational tools for strain-level microbiome analysis, we showed that it is possible to track vertical transmission of members of the microbiome from mother to infants and characterize their transcriptional activity. Our work poses the basis for surveying at larger scale the sources of microbial diversity in the infants and starts associating these transmissions with the subsequent longer-term development of a healthy or dysbiotic microbiome.\\n\\nImportanceEarly infant exposure is important in the acquisition and ultimate development of a healthy infant microbiome. There is increasing support that the maternal microbial reservoir is a key route of microbial transmission, yet much is inferred from the observation of shared species in mother and infant. Common species, per se, does not necessarily equate vertical transmission as species exhibit considerable strain heterogeneity and it is therefore imperative to identify shared strains. We demonstrate here the potential of shotgun metagenomics and strain-level resolution to identify vertical transmission events via the maternal source. Combined with a metatranscriptomic approach, we show the potential not only to identify and track the fate of microbes in the early infant microbiome but also identify the metabolically active members. These approaches will ultimately provide important insights into the acquisition, development and community dynamics of the infant microbiome.",
