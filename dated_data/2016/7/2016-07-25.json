    "abstract": "The occurrence of plant-associated oomycetes in natural ecosystems and particularly during long-term ecosystem development is largely unknown, despite the importance of many oomycetes as plant pathogens. Using DNA sequencing from roots, we investigated the frequency and host relationships of plant-associated oomycete communities along a 120 000 year glacial chronosequence, comprising site ages with rapid compositional change (\\\"early succession\\\"; 5, 15, and 70 years old soil); relatively stable higher-diversity sites (\\\"mature\\\", 280, 500, 1000, 5000, 12000 years); and ancient, nutrient-limited soils with declining plant diversity and stature (\\\"retrogression\\\", 60 000, 120 000 years). Plant-associated oomycetes were frequent in all three early successional sites, occurring in 38 - 65% of plant roots, but rare (average 3%) in all older ecosystems. Oomycetes were highly host specific, and more frequent on those plant species that declined most strongly in abundance between ecosystem ages. The results support the particular importance of plant-associated oomycetes in early succession (up to 70 years). High host specificity and correlations of abundance of oomycete inside roots with declining plant species are consistent with oomycete-driven successional change.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe ongoing yellow fever (YF) epidemic in Angola strains the global vaccine supply, prompting WHO to adopt dose sparing for its vaccination campaign in Kinshasa in July-August 2016. Although a 5-fold fractional-dose vaccine is similar to standard-dose vaccine in safety and immunogenicity, efficacy is untested. There is an urgent need to ensure the robustness of fractional-dose vaccination by elucidating the conditions under which dose fractionation would reduce transmission.\\n\\nMethodsWe estimate the effective reproductive number for YF in Angola using disease natural history and case report data. With simple mathematical models of YF transmission, we calculate the infection attack rate (IAR, the proportion of population infected over the course of an epidemic) under varying levels of transmissibility and five-fold fractional-dose vaccine efficacy for two vaccination scenarios: (i) random vaccination in a hypothetical population that is completely susceptible; (ii) the Kinshasa vaccination campaign in July-August 2016 with different age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines.\\n\\nFindingsWe estimate the effective reproductive number early in the Angola outbreak was between 5{middle dot}2 and 7{middle dot}1. If vaccine action is all-or-nothing (i.e. a proportion VE of vaccinees receives complete and the remainder receive no protection), n-fold fractionation can dramatically reduce IAR as long as efficacy VE exceeds 1/n. This benefit threshold becomes more stringent if vaccine action is leaky (i.e. the susceptibility of each vaccinee is reduced by a factor that is equal to the vaccine efficacy VE). The age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines chosen by the WHO for the Kinshasa vaccination campaign (namely, 2 years) provides the largest reduction in IAR if the efficacy of five-fold fractional-dose vaccines exceeds 20%.\\n\\nInterpretationDose fractionation is a very effective strategy for reducing infection attack rate that would be robust with a large margin for error in case fractional-dose VE is lower than expected.\\n\\nFundingNIH-MIDAS, HMRF-Hong Kong",

    "abstract": "The R package pcadapt performs genome scans to detect genes under selection based on population genomic data. It assumes that candidate markers are outliers with respect to how they are related to population structure. Because population structure is ascertained with principal component analysis, the package is fast and works with large-scale data. It can handle missing data and pooled sequencing data. By contrast to population-based approaches, the package handle admixed individuals and does not require grouping individuals into populations. Since its first release, pcadapt has evolved both in terms of statistical approach and software implementation. We present results obtained with robust Mahalanobis distance, which is a new statistic for genome scans available in the 2.0 and later versions of the package. When hierarchical population structure occurs, Mahalanobis distance is more powerful than the communality statistic that was implemented in the first version of the package. Using simulated data, we compare pcadapt to other software for genome scans (BayeScan, hapflk, OutFLANK, sNMF). We find that the proportion of false discoveries is around a nominal false discovery rate set at 10% with the exception of BayeScan that generates 40% of false discoveries. We also find that the power of BayeScan is severely impacted by the presence of admixed individuals whereas pcadapt is not impacted. Last, we find that pcadapt and hapflk are the most powerful software in scenarios of population divergence and range expansion. Because pcadapt handles next-generation sequencing data, it is a valuable tool for data analysis in molecular ecology.",

We analyzed tumor DNA samples from TCGA and observed that the cancer-associated mosaic variants are absent from the tumors.\\n\\nThrough analysis of different cancer phenotypes we observe gene-specificity for mosaic mutations. PPM1D in previous reports has been linked to breast and ovarian cancer, which our analysis confirms as a specifically associated to ovarian cancer.

    "abstract": "House dust mites are common pests with an unusual evolutionary history, being descendants of a parasitic ancestor. Transition to parasitism is frequently accompanied by genome rearrangements, possibly to accommodate the genetic change needed to access new ecology. Transposable element (TE) activity is a source of genomic instability that can trigger large-scale genomic alterations. Eukaryotes have multiple transposon control mechanisms, one of which is RNA interference (RNAi). Investigation of the dust mite genome failed to identify a major RNAi pathway: the Piwi-associated RNA (piRNA) pathway, which has been replaced by a novel small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs)-like pathway. Co-opting of piRNA function by dust mite siRNAs is extensive, including establishment of TE control master loci that produce siRNAs. Interestingly, other members of the Acari have piRNAs indicating loss of this mechanism in dust mites is a recent event. Flux of RNAi-mediated control of TEs provides a mechanism for unusual arc of dust mite evolution.",

    "abstract": "Honest communication between potential partners with conflicting interests is generally thought to require costly signals. Costly signalling can explain partner choice when it is possible to link a strategic cost to an individuals quality, like in mate choice. However, in mutualisms, it is usually impossible to link a cost to the likelihood that a potential partner will behave cooperatively in the future. In fact, signals like Nod factors in rhizobial bacteria, which form symbioses with leguminous plants, are evidence of cost-free, honest signals in situations of potential conflict. How can such a signalling system evolve? We use a population-genetics model to show that a cost-free, honest signal can evolve when the receiver is under soft selection, which is when high juvenile mortality does not lead to a corresponding reduction in fitness, a common occurrence in many species. Under soft selection, senders evolve increasingly complex messages of identity, a system akin to a password or a lock and key. Thus, a symbiont can signal that it shares a coevolutionary history with a potential host, and if that history is mutualistic, then the host can believe that the symbiont is mutualistic. Password signalling might also explain the acquisition of some defensive symbionts and the evolution of complex species-recognition signals in mate choice.

Classically, most BC types are thought to contact all cones within their dendritic field; ON BCs would contact cones exclusively via so-called invaginating synapses, while OFF BCs would form basal synapses. By mining publically available electron microscopy data, we discovered interesting violations of these rules of outer retinal connectivity: ON BC type X contacted only ~20% of the cones in its dendritic field and made mostly atypical non-invaginating contacts. Types 5T, 5O and 8 also contacted fewer cones than expected. In addition, we found that rod BCs received input from cones, providing anatomical evidence that rod and cone pathways are interconnected in both directions. This suggests that the organization of the outer plexiform layer is more complex than classically thought.",

In contrast to the classical tenet that ALS represents the outcome of extensive and progressive impairment of a fixed set of motor connections, recent neuroimaging findings suggest that the disease spreads along vast non-motor connections. Here, we hypothesised that functional network topology is perturbed in ALS, and that this reorganisation is associated with disability. We tested this hypothesis in 21 patients affected by ALS at several stages of impairment using resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and compared the results to 16 age-matched healthy controls. We estimated functional connectivity using the Phase Lag Index (PLI), and characterized the network topology using the minimum spanning tree (MST). We found a significant difference between groups in terms of MST dissimilarity and MST leaf fraction in the beta band. Moreover, some MST parameters (leaf, hierarchy and kappa) significantly correlated with disability. These findings suggest that the topology of resting-state functional networks in ALS is affected by the disease in relation to disability. EEG network analysis may be of help in monitoring and evaluating the clinical status of ALS patients.",

Dendritic cells (DC) integrate these cues to make informed decisions whether to initiate an immune response. Confronted with exogenous microbial stimuli, DC endogenously produce both anti-(IL-10) and pro-inflammatory (TNF) cues whose joint integration controls the cell's final decision. We combine experimental measurements with theoretical modeling to quantitatively describe the integration mode of these opposing signals. We propose a two step integration model that modulates the effect of the two types of signals: an initial bottleneck integrates both signals (IL-10 and TNF), the output of which is later modulated by the anti-inflammatory signal. We show that the anti-inflammatory IL-10 signaling is long ranged, as opposed to the short-ranged pro-inflammatory TNF signaling. The model suggests that the population averaging and modulation of the pro-inflammatory response by the anti-inflammatory signal is a safety guard against excessive immune responses.",

Unlike existing methods, PROGENy can (i) recover the effect of known driver mutations, (ii) provide or improve strong markers for drug indications, and (iii) distinguish between oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways for patient survival. Collectively, these results show that PROGENy more accurately infers pathway activity from gene expression than other methods.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence microscopy reveals that the contents of many (membrane-free) nuclear \\\"bodies\\\" exchange rapidly with the soluble pool whilst the underlying structure persists; such observations await a satisfactory biophysical explanation. To shed light on this, we perform large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of a chromatin fiber interacting with an ensemble of (multivalent) DNA-binding proteins; these proteins switch between two states - active (binding) and inactive (non-binding). This system provides a model for any DNA-binding protein that can be modified post-translationally to change its affinity for DNA (e.g., like the phosphorylation of a transcription factor). Due to this out-of-equilibrium process, proteins spontaneously assemble into clusters of self-limiting size, as individual proteins in a cluster exchange with the soluble pool with kinetics like those seen in photo-bleaching experiments. This behavior contrasts sharply with that exhibited by \\\"equilibrium\\\", or non-switching, proteins that exist only in the binding state; when these bind to DNA non-specifically, they form clusters that grow indefinitely in size. Our results point to post-translational modification of chromatin-bridging proteins as a generic mechanism driving the self-assembly of highly dynamic, non-equilibrium, protein clusters with the properties of nuclear bodies. Such active modification also reshapes intra-chromatin contacts to give networks resembling those seen in topologically-associating domains, as switching markedly favors local (short-range) contacts over distant ones.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism of the self-assembly and fibrillization of the prion-like domains lies at the heart of their physiology and pathology. Here with the same methods previously established, we aimed to further decipher the mechanism by characterizing two prion-like sequences with the electrostatic properties very different from that of the full-length TDP-43 prion-like domain with a very basic pI value: namely the C-half of the TDP-43 prion-like domain only abundant in Gly, Ser, Asn and Gln with a pI of ~6.3, and the FUS prion-like domain enriched with Gly, Ser, Gln and Tyr with a pI of ~3.5. Interestingly, the C-half with the TDP-43 unique hydrophobic region removed is no longer able to form insoluble aggregates/fibrils but still capable of self-assembling into the reversible hydrogel with cross-{beta} structures, despite being much slower than the full-length. On the other hand, the FUS prion-like domain rapidly self-assembles into the reversible hydrogel with cross-{beta} fibrillar structures in 1 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 but its self-assembly becomes very slow in 50 mM MES buffer at pH 5.5. Our study reveals that despite having completely different electrostatic properties, the full-length and C-half of the TDP-43 prion-like domain, as well as FUS prion-like domain all have the similar pH-dependence in self-assembly as we previously reported (Lim et al., [2016] PLOS Biol 14:e1002338). This unambiguously indicates that the self-assembly of the prion-like domains is not generally governed by the electrostatic interaction. Rather, their self-assembly and fibrillization are specified by the sequences despite being highly polar and degenerative. Furthermore, our study provides the first evidence that the formation of reversible hydrogel with cross-{beta} structures is separable from fibrillization of the prion-like domain. Finally, our results also successfully reconcile the previous discrepancy about the conformation and mechanism of the self-assembly of the FUS prion-like domain.",

    "abstract": "Injury of CNS nerve tracts remodels circuitry through dendritic spine loss and hyper-excitability, thus influencing recovery. Due to the complexity of the CNS, a mechanistic understanding of injury-induced synaptic remodeling remains unclear. Using microfluidic chambers to separate and injure distal axons, we show that axotomy causes retrograde dendritic spine loss at directly injured pyramidal neurons followed by retrograde presynaptic hyper-excitability. These remodeling events require activity at the site of injury, axon-to-soma signaling, and transcription. Similarly, directly injured corticospinal neurons in vivo also exhibit a specific increase in spiking following axon injury. Axotomy-induced hyper-excitability of cultured neurons coincides with elimination of inhibitory inputs onto injured neurons, including those formed onto dendritic spines. Netrin-1 downregulation occurs following axon injury and exogenous netrin-1 applied after injury normalizes spine density, presynaptic excitability, and inhibitory inputs at injured neurons. Our findings show that intrinsic signaling within damaged neurons regulates synaptic remodeling and involves netrin-1 signaling.",

    "abstract": "1Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective intervention for patients suffering from recurrent Clostridium difficile, a common hospital-acquired infection. FMTs success as a therapy for C. difficile has inspired interest in performing clinical trials that experiment with FMT as a therapy for other conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, diabetes, and Parkinsons disease. Results from clinical trials that use FMT to treat inflammatory bowel disease suggest that, for at least one condition beyond C. difficile, most FMT donors produce stool that is not efficacious. The optimal strategies for identifying and using efficacious donors have not been investigated. We therefore examined the optimal Bayesian response-adaptive strategy for allocating patients to donors and formulated a computationally-tractable myopic heuristic. This heuristic computes the probability that a donor is efficacious by updating prior expectations about the efficacy of FMT, the placebo rate, and the fraction of donors that produce efficacious stool. In simulations designed to mimic a recent FMT clinical trial, for which traditional power calculations predict ~100% statistical power, we found that accounting for differences in donor stool efficacy reduced the predicted statistical power to ~9%. For these simulations, using the heuristic Bayesian allocation strategy more than quadrupled the statistical power to ~39%. We use the results of similar simulations to make recommendations about the number of patients, number of donors, and choice of clinical endpoint that clinical trials should use to optimize their ability to detect if FMT is effective for treating a condition.",
