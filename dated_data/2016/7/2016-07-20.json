    "abstract": "BackgroundAutism spectrum disorders (ASD) are etiologically heterogeneous and complex. Functional genomics work has begun to identify a diverse array of dysregulated transcriptomic programs (e.g., synaptic, immune, cell cycle, DNA damage, WNT signaling, cortical patterning and differentiation) potentially involved in ASD brain abnormalities during childhood and adulthood. However, it remains unclear whether such diverse dysregulated pathways are independent of each other or instead reflect coordinated hierarchical systems-level pathology.\\n\\nMethodsTwo ASD cortical transcriptome datasets were re-analyzed using consensus weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify common coexpression modules across datasets. Linear mixed-effect models and Bayesian replication statistics were used to identify replicable differentially expressed modules. Eigengene network analysis was then utilized to identify between-group differences in how co-expression modules interact and cluster into hierarchical meta-modular organization. Protein-protein interaction analyses were also used to determine whether dysregulated co-expression modules show enhanced interactions.\\n\\nResultsWe find replicable evidence for 10 gene co-expression modules that are differentially expressed in ASD cortex. Rather than being independent non-interacting sources of pathology, these dysregulated co-expression modules work in synergy and physically interact at the protein level. These systems-level transcriptional signals are characterized by downregulation of synaptic processes coordinated with upregulation of immune/inflammation, response to other organism, catabolism, viral processes, translation, protein targeting and localization, cell proliferation, and vasculature development. Hierarchical organization of meta-modules (clusters of highly correlated modules) is also highly affected in ASD.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings highlight that dysregulation of the ASD cortical transcriptome is characterized by the dysregulation of multiple coordinated transcriptional programs producing synergistic systems-level effects that cannot be fully appreciated by studying the individual component biological processes in isolation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how host dynamics, including variations of population size and dispersal, may affect the epidemiology of infectious diseases through ecological and evolutionary processes is an active research area. Here we focus on a bank vole (Myodes glareolus) metapopulation surveyed in Finland between 2005 and 2009. Bank vole is the reservoir of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV), the agent of nephropathia epidemica (NE, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal symptom) in humans. M glareolus populations experience multiannual density fluctuations that may influence the level of genetic diversity maintained in bank voles, PUUV prevalence and NE occurrence. We examine bank vole metapopulation genetics at presumably neutral markers and immune-related genes involved in susceptibility to PUUV (Tnf-promoter, Mhc-Drb, Tlr4, Tlr7 and Mx2 gene) to investigate the links between population dynamics, microevolutionary processes and PUUV epidemiology. We show that genetic drift slightly and transiently affects neutral and adaptive genetic variability within the metapopulation. Gene flow seems to counterbalance its effects during the multiannual density fluctuations. The low abundance phase may therefore be too short to impact genetic variation in the host, and consequently viral genetic diversity. Environmental heterogeneity does not seem to affect vole gene flow, which might explain the absence of spatial structure previously detected in PUUV in this area. Besides, our results suggest the role of vole dispersal on PUUV circulation through sex-specific and density-dependent movements. We find little evidence of selection acting on immune-related genes within this metapopulation. Footprint of positive selection is detected at Tlr-4 gene in 2008 only. We observe marginally significant associations between Mhc-Drb haplotypes and PUUV serology, and between Mx2 genotype and PUUV genogroups. These results show that microevolutionary changes and PUUV epidemiology in this metapopulation are mainly driven by neutral processes, although the relative effects of neutral and adaptive forces could vary temporally with density fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Two recent studies have re-analyzed published data and found that when datasets are analyzed independently there was limited support for the widely accepted hypothesis that changes in the microbiome are associated with obesity. This hypothesis was reconsidered by increasing the number of datasets and pooling the results across the individual datasets. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were applied to identify 10 studies for an updated and more synthetic analysis. Alpha diversity metrics and the relative risk of obesity based on those metrics were used to identify a limited number of significant associations with obesity; however, when the results of the studies were pooled using a random effects model significant associations were observed between Shannon diversity, number of observed OTUs, and Shannon evenness and obesity status. They were not observed for the ratio of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes or their individual relative abundances. Although these tests yielded small P-values, the difference between the Shannon diversity index of non-obese and obese individuals was 2.07%. A power analysis demonstrated that only one of the studies had sufficient power to detect a 5% difference in diversity. When Random Forest machine learning models were trained on one dataset and then tested using the other 9 datasets, the median accuracy varied between 33.01 and 64.77% (median=56.67%). Although there was support for a relationship between the microbial communities found in human feces and obesity status, this association is relatively weak and its detection is confounded by large interpersonal variation and insufficient sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "Alternative reproductive tactics and strategies (ARTS) refer to polymorphic reproductive behaviours in which in addition to the usual two sexes, there are one or more alternative morphs, usually male, that have evolved the ability to circumvent direct intra-sexual competition. Each morph has its own morphological, ecological, developmental, behavioural, life-history, and physiological profile that shifts the balance between reproduction and self-maintenance, one aspect being immunity. Immunoecological work on species with ARTS, which is the topic of this review, is particularly interesting because the alternative morphs make it possible to separate the effects of sex, per se, from other factors that in other species are inextricably linked with sex. We first summarize the evolution, development and maintenance of ARTS. We then review immunoecological hypotheses relevant to species with ARTS, dividing them into physiological, life-history, and ecological hypotheses. In context of these hypotheses, we critically review in detail all immunoecological studies we could find on species with ARTS. Several interesting patterns emerge. Oddly, there is a paucity of studies on insects, despite the many benefits that arise from working with insects: larger sample sizes, simple immune systems, and countless forms of alternative reproductive strategies and tactics. Of all the hypotheses considered, the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis has generated the greatest amount of work, but not necessarily the greatest level of understanding. Unfortunately, it is often used as a general guiding principle rather than a source of explicitly articulated predictions. Other hypotheses are usually considered a posteriori, but it is perhaps time that they take centre stage. Whereas blanket concepts such as \"immunocompetence\" and \"androgens\" might useful to develop a rationale, predictions need to be far more explicitly articulated. Integration so far has been a one-way street, with ecologists delving deeper into physiology, seemingly at the cost of ignoring their organisms evolutionary history and ecology. One possible useful framework is to divide ecological and evolutionary factors affecting immunity into those that stimulate the immune system, and those that depress it. Finally, the contributions of genomics to ecology are being increasingly recognized, including in species with ARTS, but we must ensure that evolutionary and ecological hypotheses drive the effort, as there is no grandeur in the strict reductionist view of life.",

Furthermore, the diversity of inhibitory interneuron populations poses a challenge for understanding local circuit interactions during seizure initiation. Using a combined optogenetic and electrophysiological approach, we examined the activity of two identified hippocampal interneuron classes during seizure induction in vivo. We identified cell type-specific differences in preictal firing patterns and input sensitivity of parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons. Surprisingly, the impact of both sources of inhibition remained intact throughout the preictal period and into the early ictal phase. Our findings suggest that the onset of ictal activity is not due to a failure of inhibition, but is instead associated with a decoupling of inhibitory cells from their normal relationship with the local hippocampal network.",

We compare two compartmental models with different mosquito representations, using surveillance and seroprevalence data for several ZIKV outbreaks in Pacific islands (Yap, Micronesia 2007, Tahiti and Moorea, French Polynesia 2013-2014, New Caledonia 2014). Models are estimated in a stochastic framework with state-of-the-art Bayesian techniques. R0 for the Pacific ZIKV epidemics is estimated between 1.5 and 4.1, the smallest islands displaying higher and more variable values. This relatively low range of R0 suggests that intervention strategies developed for other flaviviruses should enable as, if not more effective control of ZIKV. Our study also highlights the importance of seroprevalence data for precise quantitative analysis of pathogen propagation, to design prevention and control strategies.",

However, the processes underlying de novo gene birth are still enigmatic. In particular, the appearance of a new functional protein seems highly improbable unless there is already a pool of neutrally evolving peptides that can at some point acquire new functions. Here we show for the first time that such peptides do not only exist but that they are prevalent among the translation products of mouse genes that lack homologues in rat and human. The data suggests that the translation of these peptides is due to the chance occurrence of open reading frames with a favorable codon composition. Our approach combines ribosome profiling experiments, proteomics data and non-synonymous and synonymous nucleotide polymorphism analysis. We propose that effectively neutral processes involving the expression of thousands of transcripts all the way down to proteins provide a basis for de novo gene evolution.",

    "abstract": "The identification of disease-causing genes in Mendelian disorders has been facilitated by the detection of rare disease-causing variation through exome sequencing experiments. These studies rely on population databases to filter a majority of the putatively neutral variation in the genome and additional filtering steps using either cohorts of diseased individuals or familial information to narrow down the list of candidate variants. Recently, new computational methods have been proposed to prioritize variants by scoring them not only based on their potential impact on protein function but also on their relevance given the available information on the disease under study. Usually these diseases comprise several phenotypic presentations, which are separately prioritized and then aggregated into a global score. In this study we compare several simple (e.g. maximum and mean score) and more complex aggregation methods (e.g. order statistics, parametric modeling) in order to obtain the best possible prioritization performance. We show that all methods perform reasonably well (median rank below 20 out of more than 8000 variants) and that the selection of an optimal aggregation method depends strongly on the fraction of uninformative phenotypes. Finally, we propose guidelines as to how to select an appropriate aggregation method based on knowledge of the phenotype under study.",

Our data suggest that both visceral smooth and somatic striated myocytes were present in the protostome-deuterostome ancestor, and that smooth myocytes later co-opted the striated contractile module repeatedly - for example in vertebrate heart evolution. During these smooth-to-striated myocyte conversions the core regulatory complex of transcription factors conveying myocyte identity remained unchanged, reflecting a general principle in cell type evolution.",

Treatment strategies for protection of at-risk mothers are limited to a narrow range of vaccines, which do not cover the bulk of the common pathogens most frequently encountered. Employing mouse models, we demonstrate that oral treatment during pregnancy with a microbial-derived immunomodulator (OM85TM), currently used clinically for attenuation of infection-associated airway inflammatory symptoms in infants-adults, markedly reduces risk for fetal loss/growth restriction resulting from maternal challenge with bacterial LPS or influenza. Focusing on LPS exposure, we demonstrate that the key molecular indices of maternal inflammatory stress, notably high levels of RANTES, MIP-1a, CCL2, IL-8 and G-CSF in gestational tissues/serum, are abrogated by OM85 pretreatment. Systems-level analyses conducted in parallel employing RNASeq revealed that OM85 pretreatment selectively tunes LPS-induced activation in maternal gestational tissues for attenuated expression of TNF-, IL1-, and IFNg-driven that drive production of these pro-inflammatory cytokines, without constraining Type1-IFN-associated networks central to first-line anti-microbial defense.

    "abstract": "Pathogenic microbes are responsible for severe production losses in crops worldwide. The use of disease resistant crop varieties can be a sustainable approach to meet the food demand of the worlds growing population. However, classical plant breeding is usually laborious and time-consuming, thus hampering efficient improvement of many crops. With the advent of genome editing technologies, in particular the CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9) system, we are now able to introduce improved crop traits in a rapid and efficient manner. In this work, we genome edited durable disease resistance in tomato by modifying a specific gene associated with disease resistance. Recently, it was demonstrated that inactivation of a single gene called DMR6 (downy mildew resistance 6) confers resistance to several pathogens in Arabidopsis thaliana. This gene is specifically up-regulated during pathogen infection, and mutations in the dmr6 gene results in increased salicylic acid levels. The tomato SlDMR6-1 orthologue Solyc03g080190 is also up-regulated during infection by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and Phytophthora capsici. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we generated tomato plants with small deletions in the SlDMR6-1 gene that result in frameshift and premature truncation of the protein. Remarkably, these mutants do not have significant detrimental effects in terms of growth and development under greenhouse conditions and show disease resistance against different pathogens, including P. syringae, P. capsici and Xanthomonas spp.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe management of insect pests has long been dominated by the use of chemical insecticides, with the aim of instantaneously killing enough individuals to limit their damage. To minimize unwanted consequences, environmentally-friendly approaches have been proposed that utilize biological control and take advantage of intrinsic demographic processes to reduce pest populations.\\nC_LIO_LIWe address the feasibility of a novel pest management strategy based on the release of insects infected with Wolbachia, which causes cytoplasmic incompatibilities in its host population, into a population with a pre-existing Allee effect. We hypothesize that the transient decline in population size caused by a successful invasion of Wolbachia can bring the population below its Allee threshold and, consequently, trigger extinction.\\nC_LIO_LIWe develop a stochastic population model that accounts for Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibilities in addition to an Allee effect arising from mating failures at low population densities. Using our model, we identify conditions under which cytoplasmic incompatibilities and Allee effects successfully interact to drive insect pest populations toward extinction. Based on our results, we delineate control strategies based on introductions of Wolbachia-infected insects.\\nC_LIO_LIWe extend this analysis to evaluate control strategies that implement successive introductions of two incompatible Wolbachia strains. Additionally, we consider methods that combine Wolbachia invasion with mating disruption tactics to enhance the pre-existing Allee effect.\\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate that Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility and the Allee effect act independently from one another: the Allee effect does not modify the Wolbachia-invasion threshold, and cytoplasmic incompatibilities only have a marginal effect on the Allee threshold. However, the interaction of these two processes can drive even large populations to extinction. The success of this method can be amplified by the introduction of multiple Wolbachia cytotypes as well as the addition of mating disruption.\\nC_LIO_LIOur study extends the existing literature by proposing the use of Wolbachia introductions to capitalize on pre-existing Allee effects and consequently eradicate insect pests. More generally, it highlights the importance of transient dynamics, and the relevance of manipulating a cascade of destabilizatons for pest management.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic genome evolves under the dual constraint of maintaining co-ordinated gene transcription and performing effective DNA replication and cell division, the coupling of which brings about inevitable DNA topological tension. DNA supercoiling is resolved and, in some cases, even harnessed by the genome through the function of DNA topoisomerases, as has been shown in the concurrent transcriptional activation and suppression of genes upon transient deactivation of topoisomerase II (topoII). By analyzing a genome wide run-on experiment upon thermal inactivation of topoII in S.cerevisiae. we were able to define 116 gene clusters of consistent response (either positive or negative) to topological stress. A comprehensive analysis of these topologically co-regulated gene clusters revealed pronounced preferences regarding their functional, regulatory and structural attributes. Genes that negatively respond to topological stress, are positioned in gene-dense pericentromeric regions, are more conserved and associated to essential functions, while up-regulated gene clusters are preferentially located in the gene-sparse nuclear periphery, associated with secondary functions and under complex regulatory control. We propose that evolves with a core of essential genes occupying a compact genomic \\\"old town\\\", whereas more recently acquired, condition-specific genes tend to be located in a more spacious \\\"suburban\\\" genomic periphery.",

    "abstract": "Despite intensive research on genetics of the craniofacial morphology using animal models and human craniofacial syndromes, the genetic variation that underpins normal human facial appearance is still largely elusive. Recent development of novel digital methods for capturing the complexity of craniofacial morphology in conjunction with high-throughput genotyping methods, show great promise for unravelling the genetic basis of such a complex trait.\\n\\nAs a part of our efforts on detecting genomic variants affecting normal craniofacial appearance, we have implemented a candidate gene approach by selecting 1,201 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 4,732 tag SNPs in over 170 candidate genes and intergenic regions. We used 3-dimentional (3D) facial scans and direct cranial measurements of 587 volunteers to calculate 104 craniofacial phenotypes. Following genotyping by massively parallel sequencing, genetic associations between 2,332 genetic markers and 104 craniofacial phenotypes were tested.\\n\\nAn application of a Bonferroni-corrected genome-wide significance threshold produced significant associations between five craniofacial traits and six SNPs. Specifically, associations of nasal width with rs8035124 (15q26.1), cephalic index with rs16830498 (2q23.3), nasal index with rs37369 (5q13.2), transverse nasal prominence angle with rs59037879 (10p11.23) and rs10512572 (17q24.3), and principal component explaining 73.3% of all the craniofacial phenotypes, with rs37369 (5p13.2) and rs390345 (14q31.3) were observed.\\n\\nDue to over-conservative nature of the Bonferroni correction, we also report all the associations that reached the traditional genome-wide p-value threshold (<5.00E-08) as suggestive. Based on the genome-wide threshold, 8 craniofacial phenotypes demonstrated significant associations with 34 intergenic and extragenic SNPs. The majority of associations are novel, except PAX3 and COL11A1 genes, which were previously reported to affect normal craniofacial variation.\\n\\nThis study identified the largest number of genetic variants associated with normal variation of craniofacial morphology to date by using a candidate gene approach, including confirmation of the two previously reported genes. These results enhance our understanding of the genetics that determines normal variation in craniofacial morphology and will be of particular value in medical and forensic fields.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThere is a remarkable variety of human facial appearances, almost exclusively the result of genetic differences, as exemplified by the striking resemblance of identical twins. However, the genes and specific genetic variants that affect the size and shape of the cranium and the soft facial tissue features are largely unknown. Numerous studies on animal models and human craniofacial disorders have identified a large number of genes, which may regulate normal craniofacial embryonic development.\\n\\nIn this study we implemented a targeted candidate gene approach to select more than 1,200 polymorphisms in over 170 genes that are likely to be involved in craniofacial development and morphology. These markers were genotyped in 587 DNA samples using massively parallel sequencing and analysed for association with 104 traits generated from 3-dimensional facial images and direct craniofacial measurements. Genetic associations (p-values<5.00E-08) were observed between 8 craniofacial traits and 34 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including two previously described genes and 26 novel candidate genes and intergenic regions. This comprehensive candidate gene study has uncovered the largest number of novel genetic variants affecting normal facial appearance to date. These results will appreciably extend our understanding of the normal and abnormal embryonic development and impact our ability to predict the appearance of an individual from a DNA sample in forensic criminal investigations and missing person cases.",
