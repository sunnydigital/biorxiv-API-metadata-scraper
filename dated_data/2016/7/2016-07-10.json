    "abstract": "Domain growth plays an important role in many biological systems, and so the inclusion of domain growth in models of these biological systems is important to understanding how these biological systems function. In this work we present methods to include the effects of domain growth on the evolution of spatial correlations in a continuum approximation of a lattice-based model of cell motility and proliferation. We show that, depending on the way in which domain growth is implemented, different steady-state densities are predicted for an agent population. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the way in which domain growth is implemented can result in the evolution of the agent density depending on the size of the domain. Continuum approximations that ignore spatial correlations cannot capture these behaviours, while those that account for spatial correlations do. These results will be of interest to researchers in developmental biology, as they suggest that the nature of domain growth can determine the characteristics of cell populations.",

    "abstract": "We present a reversible Polymorphism-Aware Phylogenetic Model (revPoMo) for species tree estimation from genome-wide data. revPoMo enables the reconstruction of large scale species trees for many within-species samples. It expands the alphabet of DNA substitution models to include polymorphic states, thereby, naturally accounting for incomplete lineage sorting. We implemented revPoMo in the maximum likelihood software IQ-TREE. A simulation study and an application to great apes data show that the runtimes of our approach and standard substitution models are comparable but that revPoMo has much better accuracy in estimating trees, divergence times and mutation rates. The advantage of revPoMo is that an increase of sample size per species improves estimations but does not increase runtime. Therefore, revPoMo is a valuable tool with several applications, from speciation dating to species tree reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging enables rich noninvasive measurements of human brain activity, but translating such data into neuroscientific insights and clinical applications requires complex analyses and collaboration among a diverse array of researchers. The open science movement is reshaping scientific culture and addressing the challenges of transparency and reproducibility of research. To advance open science in neuroimaging the Organization for Human Brain Mapping created the Committee on Best Practice in Data Analysis and Sharing (COBIDAS), charged with creating a report that collects best practice recommendations from experts and the entire brain imaging community. The purpose of this work is to elaborate the principles of open and reproducible research for neuroimaging using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and then distill these principles to specific research practices. Many elements of a study are so varied that practice cannot be prescribed, but for these areas we detail the information that must be reported to fully understand and potentially replicate a study. For other elements of a study, like statistical modelling where specific poor practices can be identified, and the emerging areas of data sharing and reproducibility, we detail both good practice and reporting standards. For each of seven areas of a study we provide tabular listing of over 100 items to help plan, execute, report and share research in the most transparent fashion. Whether for individual scientists, or for editors and reviewers, we hope these guidelines serve as a benchmark, to raise the standards of practice and reporting in neuroimaging using MRI.",

    "abstract": "MotivationWhile mutation rates can vary across the residues of a protein, when computing alignments of protein sequences the same setting of values for substitution score and gap penalty parameters is typically used across their entire length. We provide for the first time a new method called adaptive local realignment that automatically uses diverse parameter settings in different regions of the input sequences when computing multiple sequence alignments. This allows parameter settings to adapt to more closely match the local mutation rate across a protein.\\n\\nMethodOur method builds on our prior work on global alignment parameter advising with the Facet alignment accuracy estimator. Given a computed alignment, in each region that has low estimated accuracy, a collection of candidate realignments is generated using a precomputed set of alternate parameter settings. If one of these alternate realignments has higher estimated accuracy than the original subalignment, the region is replaced with the new realignment, and the concatenation of these realigned regions forms the final alignment that is output.\\n\\nResultsAdaptive local realignment significantly improves the quality of alignments over using the single best default parameter setting. In particular, this new method of local advising, when combined with prior methods for global advising, boosts alignment accuracy by as much as 26% over the best default setting on hard-to-align benchmarks (and by 6.4% over using global advising alone).\\n\\nAvailabilityA new version of the Opal multiple sequence aligner that incorporates adaptive local realignment using Facet for parameter advising, is available free for non-commercial use at http://facet.cs.arizona.edu.\\n\\nContactdeblasio@cs.arizona.edu",

This ecological switch typically occurs through the acquisition of horizontally acquired virulence genes4,5. However, the genomic features that must be present in a population prior to the acquisition of virulence genes and emergence of pathogenic clones remain unknown. We hypothesized that virulence adaptive polymorphisms (VAPs) circulate in environmental populations and are required for this transition. We developed a comparative genomic framework for identifying VAPs, using Vibrio cholerae as a model. We then characterized several environmental VAP alleles to show that, while some of them reduced the ability of clinical strains to colonize a mammalian host, other alleles conferred efficient host colonization. These results show that VAPs are present in environmental bacterial populations prior to the emergence of virulent clones. We propose a scenario in which VAPs circulate in the environment, they become selected and enriched under certain ecologicalconditions, and finally a genomic background containing several VAPs acquires virulence factors that allows for its emergence as a pathogenic clone.",

    "abstract": "The Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population is important in medical genetics due to its high rate of Mendelian disorders and other unique genetic characteristics. Ashkenazi Jews have appeared in Europe in the 10th century, and their ancestry is thought to involve an admixture of European (EU) and Middle-Eastern (ME) groups. However, both the time and place of admixture in Europe are obscure and subject to intense debate. Here, we attempt to characterize the Ashkenazi admixture history using a large Ashkenazi sample and careful application of new and existing methods. Our main approach is based on local ancestry inference, assigning each Ashkenazi genomic segment as EU or ME, and comparing allele frequencies across EU segments to those of different EU populations. The contribution of each EU source was also evaluated using GLOBETROTTER and analysis of IBD sharing. The time of admixture was inferred using multiple tools, relying on statistics such as the distributions of EU segment lengths and the total EU ancestry per chromosome and the correlation of ancestries along the chromosome. Our simulations demonstrated that distinguishing EU vs ME ancestry is subject to considerable noise at the single segment level, but nevertheless, conclusions could be drawn based on chromosome-wide statistics. The predominant source of EU ancestry in AJ was found to be Southern European ({approx}60-80%), with the rest being likely Eastern European. The inferred admixture time was {approx}35 generations ago, but multiple lines of evidence suggests that it represents an average over two or more admixture events, pre-and post-dating the founder event experienced by AJ in late medieval times, with the prebottleneck admixture event bounded between 25-55 generations ago.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe Ashkenazi Jewish population has dwelt in Europe for much of its 1000-year existence. However, the ethnic and geographic origins of Ashkenazi Jews are controversial, due to the lack of reliable historical records. Previous genetic studies have exposed links to Middle-Eastern and European ancestries, but the history of admixture in Europe has not been studied in detail yet, partly due to technical difficulties in disentangling signals from multiple admixture events. Here, we address this challenge by presenting an in-depth analysis of the sources of European gene flow and the time of admixture events, using a wide spectrum of genetic methods, extensive simulations, and a number of new approaches. Specifically, to ensure minimal confounding by the Ashkenazi Middle-Eastern ancestry, we mask out genomic regions with Middle-Eastern ancestry, and investigate the lengths and geographic sources of the remaining regions. Our results suggest a model of at least two events of European admixture. One event slightly pre-dated a late medieval founder event and was likely from a Southern European source. Another event post-dated the founder event and was likely in Eastern Europe. These results, as well as the methods introduced, will be highly valuable for geneticists and other researchers interested in Ashkenazi Jewish origins and medical genetics.",

    "abstract": "Small molecule distribution coefficients between immiscible nonaqueuous and aqueous phases--such as cyclohexane and water--measure the degree to which small molecules prefer one phase over another at a given pH. As distribution coefficients capture both thermodynamic effects (the free energy of transfer between phases) and chemical effects (protonation state and tautomer effects in aqueous solution), they provide an exacting test of the thermodynamic and chemical accuracy of physical models without the long correlation times inherent to the prediction of more complex properties of relevance to drug discovery, such as protein-ligand binding affinities. For the SAMPL5 challenge, we carried out a blind prediction exercise in which participants were tasked with the prediction of distribution coefficients to assess its potential as a new route for the evaluation and systematic improvement of predictive physical models. These measurements are typically performed for octanol-water, but we opted to utilize cyclohexane for the nonpolar phase. Cyclohexane was suggested to avoid issues with the high water content and persistent heterogeneous structure of water-saturated octanol phases, since it has greatly reduced water content and a homogeneous liquid structure. Using a modified shake-flask LC-MS/MS protocol, we collected cyclohexane/water distribution coefficients for a set of 53 druglike compounds at pH 7.4. These measurements were used as the basis for the SAMPL5 Distribution Coefficient Challenge, where 18 research groups predicted these measurements before the experimental values reported here were released. In this work, we describe the experimental protocol we utilized for measurement of cyclohexane-water distribution coefficients, report the measured data, propose a new bootstrap-based data analysis procedure to incorporate multiple sources of experimental error, and provide insights to help guide future iterations of this valuable exercise in predictive modeling.\\n\\nAbbreviations used in this paper",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment strategies, robust prognostic signatures remain elusive in most cancers. Cell proliferation has long been recognized as a prognostic marker in cancer, but it has not been thoroughly investigated across multiple cancers. Here we explore the role of cell proliferation across 19 cancers (n=6,581 patients) using tissue-based RNA sequencing from The Cancer Genome Atlas project by employing a  proliferative index derived from gene expression associated with PCNA expression. This proliferative index is significantly associated with patient survival (Cox, p-value<0.05) in 7/19 cancers, which we have defined as  proliferation-informative cancers (PICs). In PICs the proliferative index is strongly correlated with tumor stage and nodal invasion. PICs paradoxically demonstrate reduced baseline expression of proliferation machinery relative to non-PICs suggesting that non-PICs saturate their proliferative capacity early in tumor development and allow other factors to dictate prognostic outcomes. We also identify chemotherapies whose efficacy is correlated with proliferation index and highlight drugs capable of inhibiting proliferation associated expression. Additionally, we find that proliferative index is significantly associated with gross somatic mutation burden (Spearman, p=1.76x10-23) as well mutations in individual driver genes. This analysis provides a comprehensive characterization of tumor proliferation rates and their association with disease progression and prognosis across cancer types and highlights specific cancers that may be particularly susceptible to improved targeting of this classic cancer hallmark.",

With high beneficial mutation rates or large population sizes, competition between contending mutations is strong, and successful lineages can accumulate multiple mutations before any single one achieves fixation. Most current theory about asexual population dynamics either neglects this multiple-mutations regime or introduces simplifying assumptions that may not apply. Here, we develop a theoretical framework that describes the dynamics of adaptation and substitution over all mutation-rate regimes by conceptualizing the population as a collection of continuously adapting lineages. This model of \\\"lineage interference\\\" shows that each new mutants advantage over the rest of the population must be above a critical threshold in order to likely achieve fixation, and we derive a simple expression for that threshold.

    "abstract": "DNA methylation at the 5-postion of cytosine (5mC) is a well-established epigenetic modification which regulates gene expression and cellular plasticity in development and disease. The ten-eleven translocation (TET) gene family is able to oxidize 5mC to 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5hmC), providing an active mechanism for DNA demethylation, and may also provide its own regulatory function. Here we applied oxidative bisulfite sequencing to generate whole-genome DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation maps at single-base resolution in paired human liver and lung normal and cancer. We found that 5hmC is significantly enriched in CpG island (CGI) shores while depleted in CGIs themselves, in particular at active genes, resulting in a 5hmC but not 5mC bimodal distribution around CGI corresponding to H3K4me1 marks. Hydroxymethylation on promoters, gene bodies, and transcription termination regions showed strong positive correlation with gene expression within and across tissues, suggesting that 5hmC is a mark of active genes and could play a role gene expression mediated by DNA demethylation. Comparative analysis of methylomes and hydroxymethylomes revealed that 5hmC is significantly enriched in both tissue specific DMRs (t-DMRs) and cancer specific DMRs (c-DMRs), and 5hmC is negatively correlated with methylation changes, particularly in non-CGI associated DMRs. Together these findings indicate that changes in 5mC as well as in 5hmC and coupled to H3K4me1 correspond to differential gene expression in tissues and matching tumors, revealing an intricate gene expression regulation through interplay of methylome, hydroxyl-methylome, and histone modifications.",

    "abstract": "This work describes the experience with implementation of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 nuclease, expressed in C. elegans germline. The described work utilizes guide RNA-unc-22-1000 (GGAGAAGGAGGCGGTGCTGG) designed to target the polyglycine encoding stretch within the unc-22gene embedding the impure trinucleotide (NGG)n PAM repeat region. We describe the allelic spectrum of mutational events identified at position specified by gRNA-unc-22-1000. Of above experiments we conclude: i. the trinucleotide (NGG)n PAM repeat is a receptive target for the CRISPR/Cas9 experiments in C. elegans ii. we conclude the allelic spectrum indicates the gRNA-unc-22-1000 induces fairly frequent NHEJ joining events involving deletions and indels but also, a phenotypically distinct class of small in-frame deletions indicative for microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) as a result of S. pyogenes Cas9 activity at the trinucleotide (NGG)n PAM repeat region. We demonstrate guide RNA-unc-22-1000 could be used to modify complex transgenic C. elegans line expressing human beta-amyloid protein. We provide the evidence for bi-allelic transaction resulting from Cas9 action recovered in experiment in CB1138 him-6 background. We contrast the expected performance of gRNA-unc-22-1000 with guide targeting another type of C. elegans repeat embedding S. pyogenes PAM, the telomeric repeat (TTAGGC)n. We propose that preferential frame restoring MMEJ repair of the Cas9 cut at the 'modules' encoding for poly-glycine in +2(NGG)n position could be useful mode of genome engineering at the naturally occurring (NGG)n PAM embedding repeats dispersed across animal genomes.",
