    "abstract": "Single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) allows probing intermolecular interactions and conformational changes in biomacromolecules, and represents an invaluable tool for studying cellular processes at the molecular scale. smFRET experiments can detect the distance between two fluorescent labels (donor and acceptor) in the 3-10 nm range. In the commonly employed confocal geometry, molecules are free to diffuse in solution. When a molecule traverses the excitation volume, it emits a burst of photons, which can be detected by single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detectors. The intensities of donor and acceptor fluorescence can then be related to the distance between the two fluorophores.\\n\\nWhile recent years have seen a growing number of contributions proposing improvements or new techniques in smFRET data analysis, rarely have those publications been accompanied by so.ware implementation. In particular, despite the widespread application of smFRET, no complete so.ware package for smFRET burst analysis is freely available to date.\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduce FRETBursts, an open source software for analysis of freely-diffusing smFRET data. FRETBursts allows executing all the fundamental steps of smFRET bursts analysis using state-of-the-art as well as novel techniques, while providing an open, robust and welldocumented implementation. Therefore, FRETBursts represents an ideal platform for comparison and development of new methods in burst analysis.\\n\\nWe employ modern software engineering principles in order to minimize bugs and facilitate long-term maintainability. Furthermore, we place a strong focus on reproducibility by relying on Jupyter notebooks for FRETBursts execution. Notebooks are executable documents capturing all the steps of the analysis (including data files, input parameters, and results) and can be easily shared to replicate complete smFRET analyzes. Notebooks allow beginners to execute complex workflows and advanced users to customize the analysis for their own needs. By bundling analysis description, code and results in a single document, FRETBursts allows to seamless share analysis workflows and results, encourages reproducibility and facilitates collaboration among researchers in the single-molecule community.",

    "abstract": "Variation in gene expression, in addition to sequence polymorphisms, is known to influence developmental, physiological and metabolic traits in plants. Genetic mapping populations have facilitated identification of expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL), the genetic determinants of variation in gene expression patterns. We used an introgression population developed from the wild desert-adapted Solanum pennellii and domesticated tomato Solanum lycopersicum to identify the genetic basis of transcript level variation. We established the effect of each introgression on the transcriptome, and identified ~7,200 eQTL regulating the steady state transcript levels of 5,300 genes. Barnes-Hut t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding clustering identified 42 modules revealing novel associations between transcript level patterns and biological processes. The results showed a complex genetic architecture of global transcript abundance pattern in tomato. Several genetic hotspots regulating a large number of transcript level patterns relating to diverse biological processes such as plant defense and photosynthesis were identified. Important eQTL regulating transcript level patterns were related to leaf number and complexity, and hypocotyl length. Genes associated with leaf development showed an inverse correlation with photosynthetic gene expression but eQTL regulating genes associated with leaf development and photosynthesis were dispersed across the genome. This comprehensive expression QTL analysis details the influence of these loci on plant phenotypes, and will be a valuable community resource for investigations on the genetic effects of eQTL on phenotypic traits in tomato.",

    "abstract": "Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis allows researchers to efficiently extract biological insight from long lists of differentially expressed genes by interrogating them at a systems level. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of GSE analysis methods and hence it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to select an optimal GSE tool based on their particular data set. Moreover, the majority of GSE analysis methods do not allow researchers to simultaneously compare gene set level results between multiple experimental conditions.\\n\\nResults: The ensemble of genes set enrichment analyses (EGSEA) is a method developed for RNA-sequencing data that combines results from twelve algorithms and calculates collective gene set scores to improve the biological relevance of the highest ranked gene sets. redEGSEAs gene set database contains around 25,000 gene sets from sixteen collections. It has multiple visualization capabilities that allow researchers to view gene sets at various levels of granularity. EGSEA has been tested on simulated data and on a number of human and mouse data sets and, based on biologists' feedback, consistently outperforms the individual tools that have been combined. Our evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the ensemble approach for GSE analysis, and its utility to effectively and efficiently extrapolate biological functions and potential involvement in disease processes from lists of differentially regulated genes.\\n\\nAvailability and Implementation: EGSEA is available as an R package at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/EGSEA/.

Melatonin is important for normal neurodevelopment and embryonic growth and highly effective in protecting DNA from oxidative damage.

    "abstract": "Viruses are trifurcated into eukaryotic, archaeal and bacterial categories. This domain-specific ecology underscores why eukaryotic genes are typically co-opted by eukaryotic viruses and bacterial genes are commonly found in bacteriophages. However, the presence of bacteriophages in symbiotic bacteria that obligately reside in eukaryotes may promote eukayotic DNA transfers to bacteriophages. By sequencing full genomes from purified bacteriophage WO particles of Wolbachia, we discover a novel eukaryotic association module with various animal proteins domains, such as the black widow latrotoxin-CTD, that are uninterrupted in intact bacteriophage genomes, enriched with eukaryotic protease cleavage sites, and combined with additional domains to forge some of the largest bacteriophage genes (up to 14,256 bp). These various protein domain families are central to eukaryotic functions and have never before been reported in packaged bacteriophages, and their phylogeny, distribution and sequence diversity implies lateral transfer from animal to bacteriophage genomes. We suggest that the evolution of these eukaryotic protein domains in bacteriophage WO parallels the evolution of eukaryotic genes in canonical eukaryotic viruses, namely those commandeered for viral life cycle adaptations. Analogous selective pressures and evolutionary outcomes may occur in bacteriophage WO as a result of its \\\"two-fold cell challenge\\\" to persist in and traverse cells of obligate intracellular bacteria that strictly reside in animal cells. Finally, the full WO genome sequences and identification of attachment sites will advance eventual genetic manipulation of Wolbachia for disease control strategies.",

    "abstract": "Secondary bacterial infections increase morbidity and mortality of influenza A virus (IAV) infections. Bacteria are able to invade due to virus-induced depletion of alveolar macrophages (AMs), but this is not the only contributing factor. By analyzing a kinetic model, we uncovered a nonlinear initial dose threshold that is dependent on the amount of virus-induced AM depletion. The threshold separates the growth and clearance phenotypes such that bacteria decline for dose-AM depletion combinations below the threshold, stay constant near the threshold, and increase above the threshold. In addition, the distance from the threshold correlates to the growth rate. Because AM depletion changes throughout an IAV infection, the dose requirement for bacterial invasion also changes accordingly. Using the threshold, we found that the dose requirement drops dramatically during the first 7d of IAV infection. We then validated these analytical predictions by infecting mice with doses below or above the predicted threshold over the course of IAV infection. These results identify the nonlinear way in which two independent factors work together to support successful post-influenza bacterial invasion. They provide insight into coinfection timing, the heterogeneity in outcome, the probability of acquiring a coinfection, and the use of new therapeutic strategies to combat viral-bacterial coinfections.",

The current annotation of the horse genome lacks the specificity and sensitivity necessary to assess gene expression especially at the isoform level, and suffers from insufficient annotation of untranslated regions (UTR). We built an annotation pipeline for horse and used it to integrate 1.9 billion reads from multiple RNA-seq data sets into a new refined transcriptome.\\n\\nResultsThis equine transcriptome integrates eight different tissues from 59 individuals and improves gene structure and isoform resolution while providing considerable tissue-specific information. We utilized four levels of transcript filtration in our pipeline, aimed at producing several transcriptome versions that are suitable for different downstream analyses. Our most refined transcriptome includes 36,876 genes and 76,125 isoforms, with 6474 candidate transcriptional loci novel to the equine transcriptome.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have employed a variety of descriptive statistics and figures that demonstrate the quality and content of the transcriptome.

Variant matching is also usually done to maximize the number of matches, as opposed to other optimization criteria.\\n\\nResultsWe present the VarMatch algorithm for the variant matching problem. Our algorithm is based on a theoretical result which allows us to partition the input into smaller subproblems without sacrificing accuracy VarMatch is robust to different representation of complex variants and is particularly effective in low complexity regions or those dense in variants. VarMatch is able to detect more matches than either the normalization or decomposition algorithms on tested datasets. It also implements different optimization criteria, such as edit distance, that can improve robustness to different variant representations.

By a statistical analysis of coding sequences, associated with low or with high abundant proteins, we found some bicodons with significant preference usage for either of these sets. These usage preferences cannot be explained by the frequency usage of the single codons. We compute a pause propensity measure of all bicodons in nine organisms, which reveals that in many cases bicodon preference is shared between related organisms. We found that bicodons associated with sequences encoding low abundant proteins are involved in translational attenuation reported in SufIprotein in E. coli. Furthermore, we observe that the misfolding in the drug-transport protein, encoded by MDR1 gene, is better explained by a big change in the pause propensity due to the synonymous bicodon variant, rather than by a relatively small change in the codon usage. These findings suggest that bicodon usage can be a more powerful framework to understand translational speed, protein folding efficiency, and to improve protocols to optimize heterologous gene expression.",

To do so, we processed three C1 replicates from three human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. We added unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to all samples, to account for amplification bias. We found that the major source of variation in the gene expression data was driven by genotype, but we also observed substantial variation between the technical replicates.

    "abstract": "BackgroundIron is an essential element of most living organisms but is a dangerous substance when poorly liganded in solution. The hormone hepcidin regulates the export of iron from tissues to the plasma contributing to iron homeostasis and also restricting its availability to infectious agents. Disruption of iron regulation in mammals leads to disorders such as anemia and hemochromatosis, and contributes to the etiology of several other diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we test the hypothesis that hepcidin alone is able to regulate iron distribution in different dietary regimes in the mouse using a computational model of iron distribution calibrated with radioiron tracer data.\\n\\nResultsA model was developed and calibrated to the data from adequate iron diet, which was able to simulate the iron distribution under a low iron diet. However simulation of high iron diet shows considerable deviations from the experimental data. Namely the model predicts more iron in red blood cells and less iron in the liver than what was observed in experiments.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results suggest that hepcidin alone is not sufficient to regulate iron homeostasis in high iron conditions and that other factors are important. The model was able to simulate anemia when hepcidin was increased but was unable to simulate hemochromatosis when hepcidin was suppressed, suggesting that in high iron conditions additional regulatory interactions are important.",

SCZ candidate genes participate in common molecular pathways that are regulated by activity-dependent changes in neurons, including the signaling network that modulates synaptic strength and the network of genes that are targets of fragile X mental retardation protein. One important next step is to further our understanding on the role of activity-dependent changes of genes expression in the etiopathogenesis of SCZ.\\n\\nOBJECTIVETo examine whether neuronal activity-dependent changes of gene expression is dysregulated in SCZ.\\n\\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSNeurons differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from 4 cases with SCZ and 4 unaffected controls were depolarized using potassium chloride. RNA was extracted followed by genome-wide profiling of the transcriptome.\\n\\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESWe performed differential expression analysis and gene co-expression analysis to identify activity-dependent or disease-specific changes of the transcriptome. Further, we used gene set analyses to identify co-expressed modules that are enriched for SCZ risk genes.\\n\\nRESULTSWe identified 1,669 genes that are significantly different in SCZ-associated vs. control hiPSC-derived neurons and 1,199 genes that are altered in these cells in response to depolarization. We show that the effect of activity-dependent changes of gene expression in SCZ-associated neurons is attenuated compared to controls. Furthermore, these differentially expressed genes are co-expressed in modules that are highly enriched for genes affected by genetic risk variants in SCZ and other neurodevelopmental disorders.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEOur results show that SCZ candidate genes converge to gene networks that are associated with a blunted effect of activity-dependent changes of gene expression in SCZ-associated neurons. Overall, these findings show that hiPSC neurons demonstrate activity-dependent transcriptional changes that can be utilized to examine underlying mechanisms and therapeutic interventions related to SCZ.",

How T cells convert the lifetime of the extracellular TCR-pMHC interaction into an intracellular signal remains unknown. Here, we developed a synthetic signaling system in which the extracellular domains of the TCR and pMHC were replaced with short hybridizing strands of DNA. Remarkably, T cells can discriminate between DNA ligands differing by a single base pair. Single molecule imaging reveals that signaling is initiated when single ligand-bound receptors are converted into clusters, a time-dependent process requiring ligands with longer bound times. A computation model reveals that receptor clustering serves a kinetic proofreading function, enabling ligands with longer bound times to have disproportionally greater signaling outputs. These results suggest that spatial reorganization of receptors plays an important role in ligand discrimination in T cell signaling.",

Here, we investigated two reef-building corals (Pseudodiploria strigosa and Orbicella franksi) from the Flower Garden Banks (FGB) - the most isolated, high-latitude Caribbean reef system that retains high coral cover. We characterized coral size frequency distributions, quantified larval mortality rates and onset of competence, estimated larval production, and created detailed biophysical models incorporating these parameters to evaluate source-sink dynamics from 2009 to 2012. Mortality rates were similar across species but competency differed dramatically: P. strigosa was capable of metamorphosis within 2.5 days post fertilization (dpf), while O. franksi were not competent until >20dpf and remained competent up to 120dpf Despite these differences, models demonstrated that larvae of both types were similarly successful in reseeding the FGB. Nevertheless, corals with shorter pelagic larval durations (PLD), such as P. strigosa, were highly isolated from the rest of the Caribbean, while long PLD corals, such as O. franksi, could export larvae to distant northern Caribbean reefs. These results suggest that FGB coral populations are self-sustaining and highlight the potential of long PLD corals, such as endangered Orbicella, to act as larval sources for other degraded Caribbean reefs.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional atlases of subcortical brain structures are valuable tools to reference anatomy in neuroscience and neurology. In the special case of deep brain stimulation (DBS), the three most common targets are the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the internal part of the pallidum (GPi) and the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM). With the help of atlases that define the position and shape of these target regions within a well-defined stereotactic space, their spatial relationship to implanted deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes may be determined.\\n\\nHere we present a composite atlas based on manual segmentations of a multi-modal high-resolution MNI template series, histology and structural connectivity. To attain exact congruence to the template anatomy, key structures were defined using all four modalities of the template simultaneously. In a first step tissue probability maps were defined based on the multimodal intensity profile of each structure. These observer-independent probability maps provided an excellent basis for the subsequent manual segmentation particularly when defining the outline of the target regions.\\n\\nSecond, the key structures were used as an anchor point to coregister a histology based atlas into standard space. Finally, a sub-segmentation of the subthalamic nucleus into three functional zones was estimated based on structural connectivity. The resulting composite atlas uses the spatial information of the MNI template for DBS key structures that are visible on the template itself. For remaining structures, it relies on histology or structural connectivity. In this way the final atlas combines the anatomical detail of a histology based atlas with the spatial accuracy of key structures in relationship to the template anatomy. Thus, the atlas provides an ideal tool for the analysis of DBS electrode placement.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIComposite subcortical atlas based on a multimodal, high definition MNI template series, histology and tractography\\nC_LIO_LIHigh definition atlas of DBS targets exactly matching MNI 152 NLIN 2009b space\\nC_LIO_LIMultimodal subcortical segmentation algorithm applied to MNI template\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effects of three hydroelectric dams and their associated lakes on the population structure and connectivity of the coastal tailed frog, Ascaphus truei, in the North Cascades National Park Service Complex. Three dams were erected on the Skagit River in northern-central Washington state between 1924 and 1953 and subsequently changed the natural shape and movement of the Skagit River and its tributaries. We collected 183 individuals from 13 tributaries and generated a dataset of >2,500 loci (unlinked SNPs) using double digestion restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq). An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) identified ~99% of the genetic variation within groups, and the remaining variation among groups separated by dams, or the Skagit River. All populations exhibited low FST values with a maximum of 0.03474. A  de novo discriminant analysis of principal components revealed two populations with no geographic cohesiveness. However, testing groups that were partitioned a priori by the dams revealed distinctiveness of populations down-river of the lowest dam. Coalescent-based analyses of recent migration suggest that up to 17.3% of each population is composed of migrants from other populations, and an estimation of effective migration rates revealed high levels of migration heterogeneity and population connectivity in this area. Our results suggest that although the populations down-river from the lowest dam are distinguishable, a high level of A. truei population connectivity exists throughout the North Cascades National Park Service Complex.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important physiological process that drives tissue formation during development but also contributes to disease pathogenesis including fibrosis and cancer metastasis. The forkhead box transcription factor gene FOXC1 is an important developmental regulator in the generation of mesenchymal cells necessary in the formation of the anterior segment of the eye, the craniofacial skeleton and the meninges. Recently elevated expression of FOXC1 has been detected in several metastatic cancers that have undergone EMT events. We sought to determine the role of FOXC1 in the initiation of EMT events using NMuMG cells treated with TFG{beta}1. We found that although Foxc1 expression was increased following TFG{beta}1 induced EMT, Foxc1 was not required for this induction. Instead we propose that Foxc1 is required for the specification of the mesenchyme cell type, promoting an activated fibroblast phenotype over a myofibroblast phenotype following the initiation of EMT. This cells type specification was achieved through the regulation of Fibroblast growth factor (Fgfr) 1 expression. Using an RNA sequencing approach, we determined that levels of Fgfr1 normally activated upon TFG{beta}1 treatment were reduced in Foxc1-knockdown cells. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments we determined that FOXC1 could bind to an Fgfr1 upstream regulatory region. Furthermore, expression of the myofibroblast marker -smooth muscle actin (SMA) was elevated in Foxc1 knockdown cells. Finally we determined that FGF2 mediated three dimensional migratory ability was greatly impaired in Foxc1-knockdown cells. Together these results define a role for Foxc1 in specifying a mesenchymal cell type following TFG{beta}1 mediated EMT events.",

    "abstract": "Study BackgroundMain objective of the present study is to screen the protective efficiency of Khamira Gaozaban Ambari Jadwar Ood Saleeb Wala (KGAJOSW) a Unani formulation by using an experimentally induced toxicity model. Study mainly focused on the protective efficacy of the Unani formulation \\\"KGAJOSW\\\" with special emphasis to Isoproterenol (ISO) induced toxicity. This formulation has been referred as a \\\"cardio tonic\\\", both in ancient (Uddin Mk, 1967) and recent literatures (Ahmad et al, 2010) of Unanipathy. The outcome of this study will deliver the protective and non-toxic nature of the KGAJOSW. This will enhance the medicinal properties of other Unani formulation and making them non-toxic.\\n\\nExisting medicines and therapeutic procedures are target specific and have several post therapeutic complications like hypertension, Obesity, etc. Recent studies demonstrate that non-invasive treatment is the better way to treat and control development of chronic diseases like atherosclerosis. Due to these undesirable effects of synthetic drugs, the world population is turning towards medicines derived from locally available native extracts of edible plant parts and plants products, like Unani and Ayurveda.\\n\\nIn this context it is proposed to investigate the following objectives, which emphasis the lethality, ROS scavenging and expression of SOD-2 protein by KGAJOSW. The outcome of this study will focus on the mode of action and brief mechanisms operative at the \\\"cardio tonic\\\" level as affirmed for KGAJOSW in Unani pharmacopeia.\\n\\nObjectivesO_LITo identify the lethal dose of Isoproterenol and Unani formulation\\nC_LIO_LITo measure Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels\\nC_LIO_LITo check the Superoxide dismutase2 (SOD2) protein and RNA expression\\nC_LIO_LIWound healing assay to know the cell proliferation\\nC_LI\\n\\nStudy designWe come-up with a pilot study to screen the protective as well as non-toxic effects of said Unani formulation. To achieve this we adopted a model of Isoproterenol (ISO) induced toxicity which is widely used to study the myocardial infarction in cells and animals. In this study we want to induce toxicity in simian virus derived murine endothelial cell line (SVEC) cells by treating with ISO and we were assuming this toxicity could be rescued by treating with Khamira (see the Schematic representation). We designed four experimental conditions like Untreated- SVEC cells without any treatment, ISO- SVEC cells receiving Isoproterenol, Khamira- SVEC cells receiving Unani formulation, ISO+Khamira- SVEC cells receiving both Isoproterenol and Khamira.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/062802_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (33K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9b0ff7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@354c86org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@132f9baorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a93049_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Inbreeding increases parent-offspring relatedness and commonly reduces offspring viability, shaping selection on reproductive interactions involving relatives and associated parental investment (PI). Nevertheless, theories predicting selection for inbreeding versus inbreeding avoidance and selection for optimal PI have only been considered separately, precluding prediction of optimal PI and associated reproductive strategy given inbreeding. We unify inbreeding and PI theory, demonstrating that optimal PI increases when a female's inbreeding decreases the viability of her offspring. Inbreeding females should therefore produce fewer offspring due to the fundamental trade-off between offspring number and PI. Accordingly, selection for inbreeding versus inbreeding avoidance changes when females can adjust PI with the degree that they inbreed. In contrast, optimal PI does not depend on whether a focal female is herself inbred. However, inbreeding causes optimal PI to increase given strict monogamy and associated biparental investment compared to female-only investment. Our model implies that understanding evolutionary dynamics of inbreeding strategy, inbreeding depression, and PI requires joint consideration of the expression of each in relation to the other. Overall, we demonstrate that existing PI and inbreeding theories represent special cases of a more general theory, implying that intrinsic links between inbreeding and PI affect evolution of behaviour and intra-familial conflict.",

    "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare disease but still one of the most abundant causes for intellectual disability in females. Typical symptoms are onset at month 6-18 after normal pre-and postnatal development, loss of acquired skills and severe intellectual disability. The type and severity of symptoms are individually highly different. A single mutation in one gene, coding for methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), is responsible for the disease. The most important action of MECP2 is regulating epigenetic imprinting and chromatin condensation, but MECP2 influences many different biological pathways on multiple levels. In this review the known changes in metabolite levels, gene expression and biological pathways in RTT are summarized. It is discussed how they are leading to some characteristic RTT phenotypes and identifies the gaps of knowledge, namely which phenotypes have currently no mechanistic explanation leading back to MECP2 related pathways. As a result of this review the visualization of the biologic pathways showing MECP2 up-and downstream regulation was developed and published on WikiPathways.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing, catalysed by Adenosine DeAminases acting on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (ADAR), occurs predominantly in the 3 untranslated regions (3UTRs). Here we uncover an unanticipated link between ADARs (ADAR1 and ADAR2) and the expression of target genes undergoing extensive 3UTR editing. Using METTL7A (Methyltransferase Like 7A), a novel tumor suppressor as an exemplary target gene, we demonstrate that its expression could be repressed by ADARs beyond their RNA editing and dsRNA binding functions. ADARs interact with Dicer to augment the processing of pre-miR-27a to mature miR-27a. Consequently, mature miR-27a targets the METTL7A 3UTR to repress its expression level. In sum, our study unveils that the extensive 3UTR editing is merely a footprint of ADAR binding, and is dispensable for the regulation of at least a subset of target genes. Instead, ADARs contribute to cancer progression by regulating cancer-related gene expression through their non-canonical functions independent of RNA editing and dsRNA binding. The functional significance of ADARs is much more diverse than previously appreciated and this gene regulatory function of ADARs is most likely to be of higher importance than the best-studied editing function. This novel non-editing side of ADARs opens another door to target cancer. This study is timely and represents a major break-through in the field of ADAR gene regulation and cancer biology.",

    "abstract": "Given the rise of bacterial resistance against antibiotics, we urgently need alternative strategies to fight infections. Some propose we should disarm rather than kill bacteria, through targeted disruption of their virulence factors. It is assumed that this approach (i) induces weak selection for resistance because it should only minimally impact bacterial fitness, and (ii) is specific, only interfering with the virulence factor in question. Given that pathogenicity emerges from complex interactions between pathogens, hosts, and their environment, such assumptions may be unrealistic. To address this issue in a test case, we conducted experiments with the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where we manipulated the availability of a virulence factor, the iron-scavenging pyoverdine, within the insect host Galleria mellonella. We observed that pyoverdine availability was not stringently predictive of virulence, and affected bacterial fitness in non-linear ways. We show that this complexity could partly arise because pyoverdine availability affects host responses and alters the expression of regulatorily linked virulence factors. Our results reveal that virulence-factor manipulation feeds back on pathogen and host behavior, which in turn affects virulence. Our findings highlight that realizing effective and evolutionarily robust anti-virulence therapies will ultimately require deeper engagement with the intrinsic complexity of host-pathogen systems.",

    "abstract": "Two recent meta-analyses of local-scale biodiversity change over time, by the authors of the present paper, have been subject to a harsh critique. Here we use new data and analyses to respond to the main points of this critique. First, a central argument of the critique was that short-term time series lead to biased estimates of long-term biodiversity change. However, we show here that this conclusion was based entirely on two fundamental mistakes in the simulations used to support it. Second, we show that the critic's conclusion that there are negative relationships between temporal biodiversity change and study duration is entirely dependent on: (i) the unrealistic assumption that biodiversity change can be positive when study duration = 0; (ii) the use of only a subset of the available data; (iii) inclusion of a single outlier data point in a single study (out of 100 in this case); and/or (iv) a choice to use log ratios rather than slopes (when available) as the metric of temporal biodiversity change. In short, the evidence does not support the conclusion that studies of longer duration tend to find local diversity decline. Finally, the critique highlighted the obviously true fact that studies in the ecological literature represent a geographically biased sample of locations on Earth; this issue was noted in both original papers, and is relevant for all ecological data syntheses. This fact was used by the critics to cast doubt on our conclusion that, outside of areas converted to croplands or asphalt, the distribution of temporal biodiversity trends is centered on zero. As a scientific rule, future studies based on more or different data may cause us to modify our conclusion, but at present, alternative conclusions based on the geographic-bias argument rely entirely on speculation. In sum, the critique raises points of uncertainty typical of all ecological studies, but it falls far short of providing an evidence-based alternative interpretation for our results, which are now supported by syntheses of hundreds of individual data sets of temporal biodiversity change.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated in 1947 in primates in Uganda, West Africa. The virus remained confined to the equatorial regions of Africa and Asia, cycling between infecting monkeys, arboreal mosquitoes, and occasional humans. The ZIKV Asiatic strain was probably introduced into Brazil in 2013. In the current critical human epidemic in the Americas, ZIKV is transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, especially where the human population density is combined with poor sanitation. Presently, ZIKV is in contact with the rich biodiversity in all Brazilian biomes, bordering on other Latin American countries. Infections in Brazilian primates have been reported recently, but the overall impact of this virus on wildlife in the Americas is still unknown. The current epidemic in the Americas requires knowledge on the role of mammals, especially non-human primates, in ZIKV transmission to humans. The article discusses the available data on ZIKV in host animals, besides issues of biodiversity, rapid environmental change, and impact on human health in megadiverse Latin American countries. The authors reviewed scientific articles and recent news stories on ZIKV in animals, showing that 47 animal species from three orders (mammals, reptiles, and birds) have been investigated for the potential to establish a sylvatic cycle. The review aims to contribute to epidemiological studies and the knowledge on the natural history of ZIKV. The article concludes with questions that require urgent attention in epidemiological studies involving wildlife in order to understand their role as ZIKV hosts and to effectively control the epidemic.",
