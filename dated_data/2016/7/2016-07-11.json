    "abstract": "MotivationThe underlying genomic variation of a large number of pathogenic viruses can give rise to drug resistant mutations resulting in treatment failure. Next generation sequencing (NGS) enables the identification of viral quasi-species and the quantification of minority variants in clinical samples; therefore, it can be of direct benefit by detecting drug resistant mutations and devising optimal treatment strategies for individual patients.\\n\\nResultsThe ICONIC (InfeCtion respONse through vIrus genomiCs) project has developed an automated, portable and customisable high-throughput computational pipeline to assemble de novo whole viral genomes, either segmented or non-segmented, and quantify minority variants using residual diagnostic samples. The pipeline has been benchmarked on a dedicated High-Performance Computing cluster using paired-end reads from RSV and Influenza clinical samples. The median length of generated genomes was 96% for the RSV dataset and 100% for each Influenza segment. The analysis of each set lasted less than 12 hours; each sample took around 3 hours and required a maximum memory of 10 GB. The pipeline can be easily ported to a dedicated server or cluster through either an installation script or a docker image. As it enables the subtyping of viral samples and the detection of relevant drug resistance mutations within three days of sample collection, our pipeline could operate within existing clinical reporting time frames and potentially be used as a decision support tool towards more effective personalised patient treatments.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe software and its documentation are available from https://github.com/ICONIC-UCL/pipeline\\n\\nContactt.cassarino@ucl.ac.uk, pk5@sanger.ac.uk\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Briefings in Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Mouse Genomes Project is an ongoing collaborative effort to sequence the genomes of the common laboratory mouse strains. In 2011, the initial analysis of sequence variation across 17 strains found 56.7M unique SNPs and 8.8M indels. We carry out deep sequencing of 13 additional inbred strains (BUB/BnJ, C57BL/10J, C57BR/cdJ, C58/J, DBA/1J, I/LnJ, KK/HiJ, MOLF/EiJ, NZB/B1NJ, NZW/LacJ, RF/J, SEA/GnJ and ST/bJ), cataloging molecular variation within and across the strains. These strains include important models for immune response, leukemia, age-related hearing loss and rheumatoid arthritis. We now have several examples of fully sequenced closely related strains that are divergent for several disease phenotypes.\\n\\nResultsApproximately, 27.4M unique SNPs and 5M indels are identified across these strains compared to the C57BL/6J reference genome (GRCm38). The amount of variation found in the inbred laboratory mouse genome has increased to 71M SNPs and 12M indels. We investigate the genetic basis of highly penetrant cancer susceptibility in RF/J finding private novel missense mutations in DNA damage repair and highly cancer associated genes. We use two highly related strains (DBA/1J and DBA/2J) to investigate the genetic basis of collagen induced arthritis susceptibility.\\n\\nConclusionThis paper significantly expands the catalog of fully sequenced laboratory mouse strains and now contains several examples of highly genetically similar strains with divergent phenotypes. We show how studying private missense mutations can lead to insights into the genetic mechanism for a highly penetrant phenotype.",

We present a full characterization of the shapes of rooted branching trees in a form that lends itself to natural tree comparisons. The resulting metric distinguishes trees from random models known to produce different tree shapes. It separates trees derived from tropical vs USA influenza A sequences, which reflect the differing epidemiology of tropical and seasonal flu. We extend the shape metric to incorporate summary features such as asymmetry, or statistics on branch lengths. Our approach allows us to construct addition and multiplication on trees, and to create a convex metric on tree shapes which formally allows computation of average trees.",

By comparison, the latest general-purpose AMBER forcefield FF14SB locks the C14-C38 bond to the right-handed configuration in solution under the same protein simulation conditions. Statistical survival analysis shows that FF12MC folds chignolin and CLN025 in isobaric-isothermal MD simulations 2-4 times faster than FF14SB under the same protein simulation conditions.

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli K-12 W3110 grows in the presence of membrane-permeant organic acids that can depress cytoplasmic pH and accumulate in the cytoplasm. We conducted experimental evolution by daily diluting cultures in increasing concentrations of benzoic acid (up to 20 mM) buffered at external pH 6.5, a pH at which permeant acids concentrate in the cytoplasm. By 2,000 generations, clones isolated from evolving populations showed increasing tolerance to benzoate but were sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Sixteen clones grew to stationary phase in 20 mM benzoate, whereas the ancestral strain W3110 peaked and declined. Similar growth occurred in 10 mM salicylate. Benzoate-evolved strains grew like W3110 in the absence of benzoate; in media buffered at pH 4.8, pH 7.0, or pH 9.0; or in 20 mM acetate or sorbate at pH 6.5. Genomes of 16 strains revealed over 100 mutations including SNPs, large deletions, and insertion knockouts. Most strains acquired deletions in the benzoate-induced multiple antibiotic resistance (Mar) regulon or in associated regulators such as rob and cpxA, as well as MDR efflux pumps emrA, emrY, and mdtA. Strains also lost or down-regulated the Gad acid fitness regulon. In 5 mM benzoate, or in 2 mM salicylate (2-hydroxybenzoate), most strains showed increased sensitivity to the antibiotics chloramphenicol and tetracycline; some strains were more sensitive than a marA knockout. Thus, our benzoate-evolved strains may reveal additional unknown drug resistance components. Benzoate or salicylate selection pressure may cause general loss of MDR genes and regulators.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBenzoate is a common food preservative, and salicylate is the primary active metabolite of aspirin. In the gut microbiome, genetic adaptation to salicylate may involve loss or downregulation of inducible multidrug resistance systems. This discovery implies that aspirin therapy may modulate the human gut microbiome to favor salicylate tolerance at the expense of drug resistance. Similar aspirin-associated loss of drug resistance might occur in bacterial pathogens found in arterial plaques.",

    "abstract": "Tomato is known to be a natural and experimental reservoir host for many plant viruses. In the last few years a new tobamovirus species, Tomato mottle mosaic virus (ToMMV), has been described infecting tomato and pepper plants in several countries worldwide. Upon observation of symptoms in tomato plants growing in a greenhouse in Valencia, Spain, we aimed to ascertain the etiology of the disease. Using standard molecular techniques, we first detected a positive sense single-stranded RNA virus as the probable causal agent. Next, we amplified, cloned and sequenced a ~3 kb fragment of its RNA genome which allowed us to identify the virus as a new ToMMV isolate. Through extensive assays on distinct plant species, we validated Kochs postulates and investigated the host range of the ToMMV isolate. Several plant species were locally and/or systemically infected by the virus, some of which had not been previously reported as ToMMV hosts despite they are commonly used in research greenhouses. Finally, two reliable molecular diagnostic techniques were developed and used to assess the presence of ToMMV in different plants species. We discuss the possibility that, given the high sequence homology between ToMMV and Tomato mosaic virus, the former may have been mistakenly diagnosed as the latter by serological methods.",

    "abstract": "Simple rules based on population equilibria can characterize indirect interactions in three-species systems but fail to predict them when considering behavioral mechanisms. In this paper, we revisit the effects of shared predation, i.e. the situation in which two prey are consumed by a common predator. Such predation usually induces negative indirect interactions between prey, or apparent competition, through an increase of predator density and thus of predation pressure. Two mechanisms can however weaken apparent competition and lead to equivocal signs of indirect interactions. On the one hand, predator distraction, which stems from the difficulty to efficiently forage for different prey at the same moment in time and diminishes the number of prey captured per predator. On the other hand, predator negative density dependence limits predator growth. To get further insights into simple rules describing indirect interactions brought about by shared predation, we studied two classes of one-predator-two-prey models exhibiting these two mechanisms. We found robust simple rules derived from predator equilibria which state that at least one prey is favored by the presence of the other when the predators partition their foraging effort between them. These rules thus characterize a surprising wide range of indirect effects including apparent predation, apparent commensalism and apparent mutualism. They also highlight different situations in which larger predator populations do not entail smaller prey populations and in which neither prey species can be negatively affected by the other.",

To address this and other questions, we obtained 1,234 complete mtDNA genome sequences from 51 TK and AA groups from Thailand and Laos. We find high genetic heterogeneity, with 212 haplogroups. TK groups are more genetically homogeneous than AA groups, with the latter exhibiting more ancient/basal mtDNA lineages, and showing more drift effects. Modeling of demic diffusion, cultural diffusion, and admixture scenarios consistently supports the spread of TK languages by demic diffusion.

In spite, the negative correlation between stomatal density and stomatal conductance (gs), higher A is facilitated via larger pore length among genotypes from short growing seasons. In addition, higher A, was positively associated with total leafnitrogen and leaf mass per unit area. No population level differences wereobserved for water use-efficiency ({Delta}13C), however nitrogen isotope discrimination ({delta}15N) displayed latitudinalclines. Growing season phenological traits considered in this study accounted highheritability (H2 = 0.65-0.94). Melampsora rust infestation also displayed a strong latitudinal cline with high-latitude genotypes being more susceptible. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that functional trait variations are largely explained by climate of origin and facilitate selection of parents with superior adaptive traits in the Canadian willow improvement program forbioenergy and environmental applications.",
