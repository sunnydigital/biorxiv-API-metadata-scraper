    "abstract": "Trait selection has received considerable attention in the pursuit to understand niche-based community assembly processes and to generate ecological predictions. To further advance the study of trait selection, a conceptual statistical model is presented that outlines and discuss the possibilities of i) estimating the effect of interspecific interactions on traits rather than just testing weather selection has had an effect on the observed trait distributions, ii) discriminating between environmental filtering and niche partitioning processes and estimate the characteristic features and importance of both processes, and iii) predicting the effect of environmental changes and gradients on trait selection. To achieve these goals a number of necessary assumptions have to be specified and these assumptions are discussed and assessed. Simulated plant cover data from a simple uniform environment was successfully fitted to the model and the results indicates that it is possible to partition direct population growth and population growth that is mediated by interspecific interaction. The data requirements of the model are modest, i.e. time series data on plant species abundance and a species trait matrix. Consequently, the model concept may be used to model trait selection, including the effect of interspecific interactions, in many existing plant ecological datasets.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing has laid the foundation for fast and cost-effective development of phylogenetic markers. Here we present the program DO_SCPCAPISCOC_SCPCAPMO_SCPCAPARKC_SCPCAP, which streamlines the development of nuclear DNA (nDNA) markers from whole-genome (or whole-transcriptome) sequencing data, combining local alignment, alignment trimming, reference mapping and primer design based on multiple sequence alignments in order to design primer pairs from input orthologous sequences. In order to demonstrate the suitability of DO_SCPCAPISCOC_SCPCAPMO_SCPCAPARKC_SCPCAP we designed markers for two groups of species, one consisting of closely related species and one group of distantly related species. For the closely related members of the species complex of Cloeon dipterum s.l. (Insecta, Ephemeroptera), the program discovered a total of 78 markers. Among these, we selected eight markers for amplification and Sanger sequencing. The exon sequence alignments (2,526 base pairs (bp)) were used to reconstruct a well supported phylogeny and to infer clearly structured haplotype networks. For the distantly related species we designed primers for several families in the insect order Ephemeroptera, using available genomic data from four sequenced species. We developed primer pairs for 23 markers that are designed to amplify across several families. The DO_SCPCAPISCOC_SCPCAPMO_SCPCAPARKC_SCPCAP program will enhance the development of new nDNA markersby providing a streamlined, automated approach to perform genome-scale scans for phylogenetic markers.

    "abstract": "It remains unknown to what extent the human visual system interprets information about complex scenes without conscious analysis. Here we used visual masking techniques to assess whether illusory contours (Kanizsa shapes) are perceived when the inducing context creating this illusion does not reach awareness. In the first experiment we tested perception directly by having participants discriminate the orientation of an illusory contour. In the second experiment, we exploited the fact that the presence of an illusory contour enhances performance on a spatial localization task. Moreover, in the latter experiment we also used a different masking method to rule out the effect of stimulus duration. Our results suggest that participants do not perceive illusory contours when they are unaware of the inducing context. This is consistent with theories of a multistage, recurrent process of perceptual integration. Our findings thus challenge some reports, including those from neurophysiological experiments in anaesthetized animals. Furthermore, we discuss the importance to test the presence of the phenomenal percept directly with appropriate methods.",

    "abstract": "Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful at finding thousands of disease-associated genetic variants (GVs), identifying causal variants and elucidating the mechanisms by which genotypes influence phenotypes are critical open questions. A key challenge is that a large percentage of disease-associated GVs are potential regulatory variants located in noncoding regions, making them difficult to interpret. Recent research efforts focus on going beyond annotating GVs by integrating functional annotation data with GWAS to prioritize GVs. However, applicability of these approaches is challenged by high dimensionality and heterogeneity of functional annotation data. Furthermore, existing methods often assume global associations of GVs with annotation data. This strong assumption is susceptible to violations for GVs involved in many complex diseases. To address these issues, we develop a general regression framework, named Annotation Regression for GWAS (ARoG). ARoG is based on finite mixture of linear regression models where GWAS association measures are viewed as responses and functional annotations as predictors. This mixture framework addresses heterogeneity of effects of GVs by grouping them into clusters and high dimensionality of the functional annotations by enabling annotation selection within each cluster. ARoG further employs permutation testing to evaluate the significance of selected annotations. Computational experiments indicate that ARoG can discover distinct associations between disease risk and functional annotations. Application of ARoG to autism and schizophrenia data from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium led to identification of GVs that significantly affect interactions of several transcription factors with DNA as potential mechanisms contributing to these disorders.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe mosquito Aedes aegypti (L.) is a major vector of viral diseases like dengue fever, Zika and chikungunya. Aedes aegypti exhibits high morphological and behavioral variation, some of which is thought to be of epidemiological significance. Globally distributed domestic Ae. aegypti have been traditionally grouped into (i) the very pale variety queenslandensis and (ii) the type form. Because the two color forms co-occur across most of their range, there is interest in understanding how freely they interbreed. This knowledge is particularly important for control strategies that rely on mating compatibilities between the release and target mosquitoes, such as Wolbachia releases and SIT. To answer this question, we analyzed nuclear and mitochondrial genome-wide variation in the co-occurring pale and type Ae. aegypti from northern Queensland (Australia) and Singapore.\\n\\nMethods/FindingsWe typed 74 individuals at a 1170 bp-long mitochondrial sequence and at 16,569 nuclear SNPs using a customized double-digest RAD sequencing. 11/29 genotyped individuals from Singapore and 11/45 from Queensland were identified as var. queenslandensis based on the diagnostic scaling patterns. We found 24 different mitochondrial haplotypes, seven of which were shared between the two forms. Multivariate genetic clustering based on nuclear SNPs corresponded to individuals geographic location, not their color. Several family groups consisted of both forms and three queenslandensis individuals were Wolbachia infected, indicating previous breeding with the type form which has been used to introduce Wolbachia into Ae. aegypti populations.\\n\\nConclusionAedes aegypti queenslandensis are genomically indistinguishable from the type form, which points to these forms freely interbreeding at least in Australia and Singapore. Based on our findings, it is unlikely that the presence of very pale Ae. aegypti will affect the success of Aedes control programs based on Wolbachia-infected, sterile or RIDL mosquitoes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAedes aegypti, the most important vector of dengue and Zika, greatly varies in body color and behavior. Two domestic forms of this mosquito, the very pale queenslandensis and the browner type, are often found together in populations around the globe. Knowing how freely they interbreed is important for the control strategies such as releases of Wolbachia and sterile males. To answer this question, we used RAD sequencing to genotype samples of both forms collected in Singapore and northern Queensland. We did not find any association between the mitochondrial or nuclear genome-wide variation and color variation in these populations. Rather, \\\"paleness\\\" is likely to be a quantitative trait under some environmental influence. We also detected several queenslandensis individuals with the Wolbachia infection, indicating free interbreeding with the type form which has been used to introduce Wolbachia into Ae. aegypti populations. Overall, our data show that the very pale queenslandensis are not genomically separate, and their presence is unlikely to affect the success of Aedes control programs based on Wolbachia-infected, sterile or RIDL mosquitoes.",

A recently developed MS2-MCP technique for imaging transcription in living Drosophila embryos allows us to quantify the dynamics of the developmental transcription process. The initial measurement of the morphogens by the hunchback promoter takes place during very short cell cycles, not only giving each nucleus little time for a precise readout, but also resulting in short time traces. Additionally, the relationship between the measured signal and the promoter state depends on the molecular design of the reporting probe. We develop an analysis approach based on tailor made autocorrelation functions that overcomes the short trace problems and quantifies the dynamics of transcription initiation. Based on life imaging data, we identify signatures of bursty transcription initiation from the hunchback promoter. We show that the precision of the expression of the hunchback gene to measure its position along the anterior-posterior axis is low both at the boundary and in the anterior even at cycle 13, suggesting additional post-translational averaging mechanisms to provide the precision observed in fixed material.",

Here, a novel mathematical analysis is established for tethered signalling reactions in surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Applying the method to the phosphatase SHP-1 interacting with a phosphorylated tether corresponding to an immune receptor cytoplasmic tail provides 5 biophysical/biochemical constants from a single SPR experiment: two binding rates, two catalytic rates, and a reach parameter. Tether binding increased the activity of SHP-1 by 900-fold through a binding-induced allosteric activation (20-fold) and a more significant increase in local sub-strate concentration (45-fold). The reach parameter indicates that this local substrate concentration is exquisitely sensitive to receptor clustering. We further show that truncation of the tether leads not only to a lower reach but also to lower binding and catalysis. The work establishes a new framework for studying tethered signalling processes and highlights the tether as a control parameter in clustered signalling.",

    "abstract": "By nature of their small size, dense growth and frequent need for extracellular metabolism, microbes face persistent public goods dilemmas1-5. Spatial assortment can act as a general solution to social conflict by allowing extracellular goods to be utilized preferentially by productive genotypes1,6,7. Established mechanisms that generate microbial assortment depend on the availability of free space8-14; however, microbes often live in densely-packed environments, wherein these mechanisms are ineffective. Here, we describe a novel class of self-organized pattern formation that facilitates the development of spatial structure within densely-packed bacterial colonies. Contact-mediated killing through the Type VI secretion system (T6SS) drives high levels of assortment by precipitating phase separation, even in initially well-mixed populations that do not necessarily exhibit net growth. We examine these dynamics using three different classes of mathematical models and experiments with mutually antagonistic strains of Vibrio cholerae growing on solid media, and find that all appear to de-mix via the same  Model A universality class of order-disorder transition. We mathematically demonstrate that contact killing should favour the evolution of public goods cooperation, and empirically examine the relationship between T6SSs and potential cooperation through phylogenetic analysis. Across 26 genera of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, the proportion of a strains genome that codes for potentially-exploitable secreted proteins increases significantly with boththe number of Type 6 secretion systems and the number of T6SS effectors that it possesses. This work demonstrates how antagonistic traits--likely evolved for the purpose of killing competitors--can indirectlylead to the evolution of cooperation by driving genetic phase separation.",

We identified age-dependent changes in mean levels of gene expression in 5,631 genes and in splicing of 904 genes. Age related changes were widely shared across tissues, with up to 60% of age-related changes in expression and 47% on splicing in multi-exonic genes shared; amongst these we highlight effects on genes involved in diseases such as Alzheimer and cancer.

    "abstract": "MotivationIn recent years, molecular species delimitation has become a routine approach for quantifying and classifying biodiversity. Barcoding methods are of particular importance in large-scale surveys as they promote fast species discovery and biodiversity estimates. Among those, distance-based methods are the most common choice as they scale well with large datasets; however, they are sensitive to similarity threshold parameters and they ignore evolutionary relationships. The recently introduced \\\"Poisson Tree Processes\\\" (PTP) method is a phylogeny-aware approach that does not rely on such thresholds. Yet, two weaknesses of PTP impact its accuracy and practicality when applied to large datasets; it does not account for divergent intraspecific variation and is slow for a large number of sequences.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce the multi-rate PTP (mPTP), an improved method that alleviates the theoretical and technical shortcomings of PTP. It incorporates different levels of intraspecific genetic diversity deriving from differences in either the evolutionary history or sampling of each species. Results on empirical data suggest that mPTP is superior to PTP and popular distance-based methods as it, consistently, yields more accurate delimitations with respect to the taxonomy (i.e., identifies more taxonomic species, infers species numbers closer to the taxonomy). Moreover, mPTP does not require any similarity threshold as input. The novel dynamic programming algorithm attains a speedup of at least five orders of magnitude compared to PTP, allowing it to delimit species in large (meta-) barcoding data. In addition, Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling provides a comprehensive evaluation of the inferred delimitation in just a few seconds for millions of steps, independently of tree size.\\n\\nAvailabilitymPTP is implemented in C and is available for download at http://github.com/Pas-Kapli/mptp under the GNU Affero 3 license.

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the wiring map of the brain, known as the connectome, has increased greatly in the last decade, mostly due to technological advancements in neuroimaging techniques and improvements in computational tools to interpret the vast amount of available data. Despite this, with the exception of the C. elegans roundworm, no definitive connectome has been established for any species. In order to obtain this, tracer studies are particularly appealing, as these have proven highly reliable. The downside of tract tracing is that it is costly to perform, and can only be applied ex vivo. In this paper, we suggest that instead of probing all possible connections, hitherto unknown connections may be predicted from the data that is already available. Our approach uses a  latent space model that embeds the connectivity in an abstract physical space. Regions that are close in the latent space have a high chance of being connected, while regions far apart are most likely disconnected in the connectome. After learning the latent embedding from the connections that we did observe, the latent space allows us to predict connections that have not been probed previously. We apply the methodology to two connectivity data sets of the macaque and we demonstrate that the latent space model is successful in predicting unobserved connectivity, outperforming two alternative baselines in nearly all cases. Furthermore, we show how the latent spatial embedding may be used to integrate multimodal observations (i.e. anterograde and retrograde tracers) for the mouse neocortex. Finally, our probabilistic approach enables us to make explicit which connections are easy to predict and which prove difficult, allowing for informed follow-up studies.",

Here we identify novel, putative single-copy nuclear DNA (nDNA) phylogenetic markers to study the colonization and diversification of an aquatic insect species complex, Cloeon dipterum L. 1761 (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae), in Macaronesia. Whole-genome sequencing data from one member of the species complex were used to identify 59 nDNA loci (32,213 base pairs), followed by Sanger sequencing of 29 individuals sampled from 13 islands of three Macaronesian archipelagos. Multispecies coalescent analyses established six putative species. Three island species formed a monophyletic clade, with one species occurring on the Azores, Europe and North America. Ancestral state reconstruction indicated at least two colonization events from the mainland (Canaries, Azores) and one within the archipelago (between Madeira and the Canaries). Random subsets of the 59 loci showed a positive linear relationship between number of loci and node support. In contrast, node support in the multispecies coalescent tree was negatively correlated with mean number of phylogenetically informative sites per locus, suggesting a complex relationship between tree resolution and marker variability. Our approach highlights the value of combining coalescent-based phylogeography, species delimitation, and phylogenetic reconstruction to resolve recent diversification events in an archipelago species complex.",

    "abstract": "Shigella sonnei has caused unusually large outbreaks of shigellosis in California in 2014 - 2015. Preliminary data indicated the involvement of two distinct yet related bacterial populations, one from San Diego and San Joaquin (SD/SJ) and one from the San Francisco (SF) Bay area. Whole genome sequencing of sixty-eight outbreak and archival isolates of S. sonnei was performed to investigate the microbiological factors related to these outbreaks. Both SD/SJ and SF populations, as well as almost all of the archival S. sonnei isolates belonged to sequence type 152 (ST152). Genome-wide SNP analysis clustered the majority of California (CA) isolates to an earlier described global Lineage III, which has persisted in CA since 1986. Isolates in the SD/SJ population had a novel Shiga-toxin (STX)-encoding lambdoid bacteriophage, most closely related to that found in an Escherichia coli O104:H4 strain responsible for a large outbreak. However, the STX genes (stxla and stxlb) from this novel phage had sequences most similar to the phages from S. flexneri and S. dysenteriae. The isolates in the SF population yielded evidence of fluoroquinolone resistance acquired via the accumulation of point mutations in gyrA and parC genes. Thus, the CA S. sonnei lineage continues to evolve by the acquisition of increased virulence and antibiotic resistance, and enhanced monitoring is advocated for its early detection in future outbreaks.",
