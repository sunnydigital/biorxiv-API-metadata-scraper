    "abstract": "Comparative and evolutive ecologists are interested in the distribution of quantitative traits among related species. The classical framework for these distributions consists of a random process running along the branches of a phylogenetic tree relating the species. We consider shifts in the process parameters, which reveal fast adaptation to changes of ecological niches. We show that models with shifts are not identifiable in general. Constraining the models to be parsimonious in the number of shifts partially alleviates the problem but several evolutionary scenarios can still provide the same joint distribution for the extant species. We provide a recursive algorithm to enumerate all the equivalent scenarios and to count the effectively different scenarios. We introduce an incomplete-data framework and develop a maximum likelihood estimation procedure based on the EM algorithm. Finally, we propose a model selection procedure, based on the cardinal of effective scenarios, to estimate the number of shifts and prove an oracle inequality.",

    "abstract": "High-density marker panels and/or whole-genome sequencing,coupled with advanced phenotyping pipelines and sophisticated statistical methods, have dramatically increased our ability to generate lists of candidate genes or regions that are putatively associated with phenotypes or processes of interest. However, the speed with which we can validate genes, or even make reasonable biological interpretations about the principles underlying them, has not kept pace. A promising approach that runs parallel to explicitly validating individual genes is analyzing a set of genes together and assessing the biological similarities among them. This is often achieved via gene ontology (GO) analysis, a powerful tool that involves evaluating publicly available gene annotations. However, additional tools such as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH terms) can also be used to evaluate sets of genes to make biological interpretations. In this manuscript, wedescribe utilizing MeSH terms to make biological interpretations in maize. MeSH terms are assigned to PubMed-indexed manuscripts by the National Library of Medicine, and can be directly mapped to genes to develop gene annotations. Once mapped, these terms can be evaluated for enrichment in sets of genes or similarity between gene sets to provide biological insights. Here, we implement MeSH analyses in five maize datasets to demonstrate how MeSH can be leveraged by the maize and broader crop-genomics community.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian transcriptomes are complex and formed by extensive promoter activity. In addition, gene promoters are largely divergent and initiate transcription of reverse-oriented promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs). Although PROMPTs are commonly terminated early, influenced by polyadenylation sites, promoters often cluster so that the divergent activity of one might impact another. Here, we find that the distance between promoters strongly correlates with the expression, stability and length of their associated PROMPTs. Adjacent promoters driving divergent mRNA transcription support PROMPT formation, but due to polyadenylation site constraints, these transcripts tend to spread into the neighboring mRNA on the same strand. This mechanism to derive new alternative mRNA transcription start sites (TSSs) is also evident at closely spaced promoters supporting convergent mRNA transcription. We suggest that basic building blocks of divergently transcribed core promoter pairs, in combination with the wealth of TSSs in mammalian genomes, provides a framework with which evolution shapes transcriptomes.",

    "abstract": "ADP-ribosylation refers to the addition of one or more ADP-ribose units onto proteins post-translationally. This protein modification is often added by ADP-ribosyltransferases, commonly known as PARPs, but it can also be added by other enzymes, including sirtuins or bacterial toxins. While past literature has utilized a variety of methods to identify ADP-ribosylated proteins, recent proteomics studies bring the power of mass spectrometry to determine sites of the modification. To appreciate the diverse roles of ADP-ribosylation across the proteome, we have created ADPriboDB--a database of ADP-ribosylated proteins (http://ADPriboDB.leunglab.org). Each entry of ADPriboDB is annotated manually by at least two independent curators from the literature between January 1975 and July 2015. The current database includes over 12,400 protein entries from 459 publications, identifying 2,389 unique proteins. Here we describe the structure and the current state of ADPriboDB as well as the criteria for entry inclusion. Using this aggregate data, we identified a statistically significant enrichment of ADP-ribosylated proteins in non-membranous RNA granules. To our knowledge, ADPriboDB is the first publicly available database encapsulating ADP-ribosylated proteins identified from the past 40 years, with a hope to facilitate the research of both basic scientists and clinicians to better understand ADP-ribosylation at the molecular level.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the complex mutation patterns that give rise to drug resistant viral strains provides a foundation for developing more effective treatment strategies for HIV/AIDS. Multiple sequence alignments of drug-experienced HIV-1 protease sequences contain networks of many pair correlations which can be used to build a (Potts) Hamiltonian model of these mutation patterns. Using this Hamiltonian model we translate HIV protease sequence covariation data into quantitative predictions for the probability of observing specific mutation patterns which are in agreement with the observed sequence statistics. We find that the statistical energies of the Potts model are correlated with the fitness of individual proteins containing therapy-associated mutations as estimated by in vitro measurements of protein stability and viral infectivity. We show that the penalty for acquiring primary resistance mutations depends on the epistatic interactions with the sequence background. Primary mutations which lead to drug resistance can become highly advantageous (or entrenched) by the complex mutation patterns which arise in response to drug therapy despite being destabilizing in the wildtype background. Anticipating epistatic effects is important for the design of future protease inhibitor therapies.",

    "abstract": "Norepinephrine/noradrenaline is a neurotransmitter implicated in arousal and other aspects of vertebrate behavior and physiology. In invertebrates, adrenergic signaling is considered absent and analogous functions are performed by the biogenic amines octopamine and its precursor tyramine. These chemically similar transmitters signal by related families of GPCR in vertebrates and invertebrates, suggesting that octopamine/tyramine are the invertebrate equivalents of vertebrate norepinephrine. However, the evolutionary relationships and origin of these transmitter systems remain unclear. Using phylogenetic analysis and receptor pharmacology, here we establish that norepinephrine, octopamine, and tyramine receptors coexist in some marine invertebrates. In the protostomes Platynereis dumerilii (an annelid) and Priapulus caudatus (a priapulid) we identified and pharmacologically characterized adrenergic 1 and 2 receptors that coexist with octopamine , octopamine {beta}, tyramine type 1, and tyramine 2 receptors. These receptors represent the first examples of adrenergic receptors in protostomes. In the deuterostome Saccoglossus kowalewskii (a hemichordate), we identified and characterized octopamine , octopamine {beta}, tyramine type 1, and tyramine 2 receptors, representing the first example of these receptors in deuterostomes. S. kowalewskii also has adrenergic 1 and 2 receptors, indicating that all three signaling systems coexist in this animal. In phylogenetic analysis, we also identified adrenergic and tyramine receptor orthologs in xenacoelomorphs. Our results clarify the history of monoamine signaling in bilaterians. Since all six receptor families (two each for octopamine and tyramine and three for norepinephrine) can be found in representatives of the two major clades of Bilateria, the protostomes and the deuterostomes, all six receptors coexisted in the protostome-deuterostome last common ancestor. Adrenergic receptors were lost from most insects and nematodes and tyramine and octopamine receptors were lost from most deuterostomes. This complex scenario of differential losses cautions that octopamine signaling in protostomes is not a good model for adrenergic signaling in deuterostomes, and that the studies of marine animals where all three transmitter systems coexist will be needed for a better understanding of the origin and ancestral functions of these transmitters.",

    "abstract": "Short tandem repeat (STRs or microsatellites) variants, are highly polymorphic markers that facilitate powerful, high-precision population genetic analyses. STRs are especially valuable in conservation and ecological genetic research, yielding detailed information on population structure and short-term demographic flux. However, STR marker development and analysis by conventional PCR-based methods imposes a workflow bottleneck and is suboptimal for noninvasive sampling strategies such as fecal DNA recovery. While massively parallel sequencing has not previously been leveraged for scalable, efficient STR recovery, here we present a pipeline for developing STR markers directly from high-throughput shotgun sequencing data without requiring a reference genome assembly, and a methodological approach for highly parallel recovery of enriched STR loci. We first employed our approach to design and capture a panel of 5,000 STR loci from a test group of diademed sifakas (Propithecus diadema, n=3), endangered Malagasy rainforest lemurs, and we report extremely efficient recovery of targeted loci--97.3-99.6% of STRs characterized with [&ge;]10x non-redundant coverage. Second, we tested our STR capture strategy on a P. diadema fecal DNA preparation, and report robust initial results and methodological suggestions for future implementations. In addition to STR targets, this approach also generates large, genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels from regions flanking the STR loci. Our method provides a cost-effective and highly scalable solution for rapid recovery of large STR and SNP datasets in any species without need for a reference genome, and can be used even with suboptimal DNA, which is more easily acquired in conservation and ecological genetic studies.\\n\\nData DepositionRaw sequencing data are available under Study Accession numbers SRP073167 (genomic shotgun data for Oberon and Tatiana) and SRP076225 (targeted re-sequencing data) from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive.

    "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity is thought to be the principal mechanism underlying learning in the brain. Models of plastic networks typically combine point neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) as the learning rule. However, a point neuron does not capture the complexity of dendrites, which allow non-linear local processing of the synaptic inputs. Furthermore, experimental evidence suggests that STDP is not the only learning rule available to neurons. Implementing biophysically realistic neuron models, we studied how dendrites allow for multiple synaptic plasticity mechanisms to coexist in a single cell. In these models, we compared the conditions for STDP and for the synaptic strengthening by local dendritic spikes. We further explored how the connectivity between two cells is affected by these plasticity rules and the synaptic distributions. Finally, we show how memory retention in associative learning can be prolonged in networks of neurons with dendrites.",

    "abstract": "Among the large eutherian ( placental) mammals, ursids (bears) give birth to the most altricial neonates with the lowest neonatal:maternal body mass ratios. This is particularly exemplified by giant pandas in whom the transition from colostrum to main-phase lactation is unusually prolonged. To examine whether there is compensation for the provision of developmentally important nutrients that other species groups may provide in utero, we examined colostrum and milk lipids from birth until the transition was complete. Lipids known to be developmental signals or their precursors, and those that are fundamental to nervous system construction, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and phosphatidylserines containing DHA, appear early and then fall dramatically in concentration to a baseline at about 20 days. This also applies to other signalling lipids such as lysophosphatidylserines. The dynamics of lysophosphatidic acid and eicosanoids display a similar pattern, albeit less clearly and with differences between mothers. Triglycerides occur at relatively low levels initially and then increase in concentration with time post-partum until a plateau is reached at about 30 days or later. These patterns indicate an early provision of signalling lipids and their precursors, and lipids crucial to brain, retinal and central nervous system construction, followed by a changeover to lipids for energy metabolism. Thus, in giant pandas, and possibly among ursids in general, lactation is adapted to provisioning a highly altricial neonate to a degree that approximates to an extension of gestation.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid transgenes are often recognized as foreign genetic material by cell surveillance mechanisms and are repressed in expression inversely to their copy numbers. Here, we compare the expression of multiple Adh-promoter-white reporter (Adh-w) inserts in paired and unpaired configurations in Drosophila somatic cells. The unpaired copies exhibit a clear repression at the transcriptional level relative to paired gene dosage effect, which is dependent upon long noncoding RNA, Polycomb and piwi. Deficiency mapping using Adh-w constructs showed that a minimal sequence of 532 bp of the Adh promoter is required for unpaired DNA silencing. Long noncoding RNA detected from this region of the Adh promoter is abundant in the unpaired condition. It serves as a docking site for at least two proteins POLYCOMB and Piwi that are essential for active transcriptional silencing. The lesser abundance of noncoding RNAs in the paired configuration only allows PC binding. An active RNA-Protein complex binds to unpaired copies. The loss-of-function piwi mutation relieves transcriptional silencing even in association with POLYCOMB. It suggests that functional RNA-Piwi complex might create a silencing driven chromatin configuration by accumulating histone modifying enzymes at the Adh-w promoter target. This distinct transcriptional silencing that is stronger for unpaired DNA represents a novel mechanism to repress new transposon and foreign DNA insertions for protection of genome integrity.",

As such, the Wnt signaling pathways have been shown to control stem cell fate. In many cell types, the R-Spondin (Rspo) family of secreted proteins acts as potent activators of the canonical Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway. Here, we identify Rspo1 as a mediator of skeletal muscle tissue repair. Firstly we show that Rspo1-null muscles do not display any abnormalities at the basal level. However deletion of Rspo1 results in global alteration of muscle regeneration kinetics following acute injury. We found that muscle stem cells lacking Rspo1 show delayed differentiation. Transcriptome analysis further demonstrated that Rspo1 is required for the activation of Wnt/{beta}-catenin target genes in muscle cells. Furthermore, muscle cells lacking Rspo1 fuse with a higher frequency than normal cells, leading to larger myotubes containing more nuclei both in vitro and in vivo. We found the increase in muscle fusion was dependent on up-regulation of non-canonical Wnt7a/Fzd7/Rac1 signaling. We conclude that antagonistic control of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways by Rspo1 in muscle stem cell progeny is important for restitution of normal muscle architecture during skeletal muscle regeneration.",

The traits currently with the most compelling evidence for sex-dependent genetic effects are for adiposity (predictive of cardiac disease), type II diabetes, asthma and inflammatory bowel disease.

There are also reports where an allele that increases risk of a disease in one sex reduces risk of the same disease in the other sex but none have been replicated, and there is no biochemical reason why this could be true. It effectively constitutes a sexually antagonistic effect, but should be distinguished from intra-locus sexual conflict which explicitly requires than an allele have opposing effects on the evolutionary fitness of males and females (Bonduriansky and Chenoweth 2009).

However, to date few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have demonstrated genome-wide significance, hampering efforts aimed at determining which genetic variants are most important for cognitive function and which regions drive the genetic associations between cognitive function and disease states. Here, we combine multiple large genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets, from the CHARGE cognitive consortium and UK Biobank, to partition the genome into 52 functional annotations and an additional 10 annotations describing tissue-specific histone marks. Using stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression we show that, in two measures of cognitive function, SNPs associated with cognitive function cluster in regions of the genome that are under evolutionary negative selective pressure. These conserved regions contained ~2.6% of the SNPs from each GWAS but accounted for ~40% of the SNP-based heritability. The results suggest that the search for causal variants associated with cognitive function, and those variants that exert a pleiotropic effect between cognitive function and health, will be facilitated by examining these enriched regions.",

    "abstract": "RationaleAtopic asthma is a persistent disease characterized by intermittent wheeze and progressive loss of lung function. The disease is thought to be driven primarily by chronic aeroallergen-induced Th2-associated airways inflammation. However, the vast majority of atopics do not develop asthma-related wheeze, despite ongoing exposure to aeroallergens to which they are strongly sensitized, indicating that additional pathogenic mechanism(s) operate in conjunction with Th2 immunity to drive asthma pathogenesis.\\n\\nObjectivesEmploy systems level analyses to identify inflammation-associated gene networks operative at baseline in sputum-derived RNA from house dust mite-sensitized (HDMs) subjects with/without wheezing history; identify networks characteristic of the ongoing asthmatic state. All subjects resided in the constitutively-HDMhigh Perth environment.\\n\\nMethodsGenome wide expression profiling by RNASeq followed by gene coexpression network analysis.\\n\\nMeasurements/ResultsHDMs-nonwheezers displayed baseline gene expression in sputum including IL-5, IL-13 and CCL17. HDMs-wheezers showed equivalent expression of these classical Th2-effector genes but their overall baseline sputum signatures were more complex, comprising hundreds of Th2-associated and epithelial-associated genes, networked into two separate coexpression modules. The first module was connected by the hubs EGFR, ERBB2, CDH1 and IL-13. The second module was associated with CDHR3, and contained genes that control mucociliary clearance.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings provide new insight into the inflammatory mechanisms operative at baseline in the airway mucosal microenvironment in atopic asthmatics undergoing natural perennial aeroallergen exposure. The molecular mechanism(s) that determine susceptibility to asthma amongst these subjects involve interactions between Th2-and epithelial function-associated genes within a complex co-expression network, which is not operative in equivalently sensitized/exposed atopic non-asthmatics.\\n\\nFundingThis study was funded by the Asthma Foundation WA, the Department of Health WA, and the NHMRC.

    "abstract": "Increasing CO2 concentrations are strongly controlled by the behaviour of undisturbed forests, which are believed to be a major current sink of atmospheric CO2. There are many models which predict forest responses to environmental changes but they are almost exclusively carbon source (i.e. photosynthesis) driven. Here we present a model for an individual tree that takes into account also the intrinsic limits of meristems and cellular growth rates, as well as control mechanisms within the tree that influence its diameter and height growth over time. This new framework is built on process-based understanding combined with differential equations solved by the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF45) numerical method. It was successfully tested for stands of beech trees in two different sites representing part of a long-term forest yield experiment in Germany. This model provides new insights into tree growth and limits to tree height, and addresses limitations of previous models with respect to sink-limited growth.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGreenhouse gas emissions, in particular of CO2, have emerged as one of the most important global concerns, and it is therefore important to understand the behaviour of forests as they absorb and store a very large quantity of carbon. Most models treat forests as boxes with growth only driven by photosynthesis, while their actual growth depends also on many other important processes such as the maximal rate at which individual cells can grow, the influences of temperature and soil moisture on these cells, and the control that the tree has on itself through endogenous signalling pathways. Therefore, and with inspiration from process-based understanding of the biological functioning of trees, we have developed a model which takes into account these different factors. We first use this knowledge and additional basic assumptions to derive a system of several equations which, when solved, enable us to predict the height and the radius of an individual tree at a given time, provided that we have enough information about its initial state and its surroundings. We use the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg mathematical method to obtain a numerical solution and thus predict the development of the height and radius of an individual tree over time under specified conditions.",

    "abstract": "Mutations occur at vastly different rates across the genome, and populations, leading to differences in the spectrum of segregating polymorphisms. Here, we investigate variation in the rare variant spectrum in a sample of human genomes representing all major world populations. We find at least two distinct signatures of variation. One, consistent with a previously reported signature is characterized by an increased rate of TCC>TTC mutations in people from Western Eurasia and South Asia, likely related to differences in the rate, or efficiency of repair, of damage due to deamination of methylated guanine. We describe the geographic extent of this signature and show that it is detectable in the genomes of ancient, but not archaic humans. The second signature is private to certain Native American populations, and is concentrated at CpG sites. We show that this signature is not driven by differences in the CpG mutation rate, but is a result of the fact that highly mutable CpG sites are more likely to undergo multiple independent mutations across human populations, and the spectrum of such mutations is highly sensitive to recent demography. Both of these effects dramatically affect the spectrum of rare variants across human populations, and should be taken into account when using mutational clocks to make inference about demography.",

    "abstract": "Ferritins are ubiquitous proteins that oxidise and store iron within a protein shell to protect cells from oxidative damage. We have characterized the structure and function of a new member of the ferritin superfamily that is sequestered within an encapsulin capsid. We show that this encapsulated ferritin (EncFtn) has two main alpha helices, which assemble in a metal dependent manner to form a ferroxidase centre at a dimer interface. EncFtn adopts an open decameric structure that is topologically distinct from other ferritins. While EncFtn acts as a ferroxidase, it cannot mineralize iron. Conversely, the encapsulin shell associates with iron, but is not enzymatically active, and we demonstrate that EncFtn must be housed within the encapsulin for iron storage. This encapsulin nanocompartment is widely distributed in bacteria and archaea and represents a distinct class of iron storage system where the oxidation and mineralization of iron are distributed between two proteins.",

    "abstract": "Life history theory predicts that optimal strategies of parental investment will depend on ecological and social factors such as current brood value and offspring need. Parental care strategies are also likely to be mediated in part by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and glucocorticoid hormones. Here we present an experiment in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), a biparental songbird with wide geographic distribution, asking whether parental care is strategically adjusted in response to signals of offspring need and brood value and whether glucocorticoids are involved in these adjustments. Using an automated playback system, we carried out playbacks of nestling begging calls specifically to females in two populations differing in their brood value: a northern population in Ontario, Canada (relatively high brood value) and a southern population in North Carolina, USA (lower brood value). We quantified female offspring provisioning rates before and during playbacks and plasma corticosterone levels (cort) once during late incubation and once immediately after playbacks. Females in both populations increased feeding rates temporarily during the first two hours of playback but the increase was not sustained for the entire duration of playback (six hours). Cort levels from samples at the end of the playback did not differ between control females and females that received playbacks. However, females that had higher increases in cort between the incubation and nestling period had greater fledging success. These results suggest that females are able to strategically respond to offspring need, although the role of glucocorticoids in this strategic adjustment remains unclear.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli K-12 W3110 grows in the presence of membrane-permeant organic acids that can depress cytoplasmic pH and accumulate in the cytoplasm. We conducted experimental evolution by daily diluting cultures in increasing concentrations of benzoic acid (up to 20 mM) buffered at external pH 6.5, a pH at which permeant acids concentrate in the cytoplasm. By 2,000 generations, clones isolated from evolving populations showed increasing tolerance to benzoate but were sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Sixteen clones grew to stationary phase in 20 mM benzoate, whereas the ancestral strain W3110 peaked and declined. Similar growth occurred in 10 mM salicylate. Benzoate-evolved strains grew like W3110 in the absence of benzoate; in media buffered at pH 4.8, pH 7.0, or pH 9.0; or in 20 mM acetate or sorbate at pH 6.5. Genomes of 16 strains revealed over 100 mutations including SNPs, large deletions, and insertion knockouts. Most strains acquired deletions in the benzoate-induced multiple antibiotic resistance (Mar) regulon or in associated regulators such as rob and cpxA, as well as MDR efflux pumps emrA, emrY, and mdtA. Strains also lost or down-regulated the Gad acid fitness regulon. In 5 mM benzoate, or in 2 mM salicylate (2-hydroxybenzoate), most strains showed increased sensitivity to the antibiotics chloramphenicol and tetracycline; some strains were more sensitive than a marA knockout. Thus, our benzoate-evolved strains may reveal additional unknown drug resistance components. Benzoate or salicylate selection pressure may cause general loss of MDR genes and regulators.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBenzoate is a common food preservative, and salicylate is the primary active metabolite of aspirin. In the gut microbiome, genetic adaptation to salicylate may involve loss or downregulation of inducible multidrug resistance systems. This discovery implies that aspirin therapy may modulate the human gut microbiome to favor salicylate tolerance at the expense of drug resistance. Similar aspirin-associated loss of drug resistance might occur in bacterial pathogens found in arterial plaques.",
