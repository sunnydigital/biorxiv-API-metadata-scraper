    "abstract": "Animal and plant richness in tropical rainforests has long intrigued naturalist. More recent work has revealed that parasites contribute to high tropical tree diversity (Bagchi et al., 2014; Terborgh, 2012) and that arthropods are the most diverse eukaryotes in these forests (Erwin, 1982; Basset et al., 2012). It is unknown if similar patterns are reflected at the microbial scale with unicellular eukaryotes or protists. Here we show, using environmental metabarcoding and a novel phylogeny-aware cleaning step, that protists inhabiting Neotropical rainforest soils are hyperdiverse and dominated by the parasitic Apicomplexa, which infect arthropods and other animals. These host-specific protist parasites potentially contribute to the high animal diversity in the forests by reducing population growth in a density-dependent manner. By contrast, we found too few Oomycota to broadly drive high tropical tree diversity in a host-specific manner under the Janzen-Connell model (Janzen, 1970; Connell, 1970). Extremely high OTU diversity and high heterogeneity between samples within the same forests suggest that protists, not arthropods, are the most diverse eukaryotes in tropical rainforests. Our data show that microbes play a large role in tropical terrestrial ecosystems long viewed as being dominated by macro-organisms.\\n\\nContact: dunthorn@rhrk.uni-kl.de",

    "abstract": "Few now dispute that a few percent of the DNA of non-African humans is a legacy of interbreeding with Neanderthals. However, heterozygosity and mutation rate appear to be linked such that the loss of diversity associated with humans migrating out of Africa caused a mutational slowdown, allowing Africans to diverge more from both our common ancestor and Neanderthals. Here I use a range of contrasting tests aimed at distinguishing between mutation slowdown and introgression as explanations for the higher rates of base-sharing between non-Africans and Neanderthals. In every instance the mutation slowdown hypothesis fits better. Thus, while some interbreeding likely occurred, as evidenced by the finding of skeletons of admixed individuals, adaptive genes and the apparently large contribution of Denisovan DNA to Oceanian genomes, my results challenge the idea that non-Africans generally carry an appreciable Neanderthal legacy. My analysis shows that inferences about introgression may be unreliable unless variation in mutation rate linked to demographically induced changes in heterozygosity can be excluded as an alternative hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Sex chromosomes can evolve during the evolution of genetic sex determination (GSD) from environmental sex determination (ESD). Despite theoretical attention, early mechanisms involved in the transition from ESD to GSD have yet to be studied in nature. No mixed ESD-GSD animal species have been reported, except for some species of Daphnia, small freshwater crustaceans in which sex is usually determined solely by the environment, but in which a dominant female sex-determining locus is present in some populations. This locus follows Mendelian single-locus inheritance, but has otherwise not been characterized genetically. We now show that the sex-determining genomic region maps to the same low-recombining peri-centromeric region of linkage group 3 (LG3) in three highly divergent populations of D. magna, and spans 3.6 Mb. Despite low levels of recombination, the associated region contains signs of historical recombination, suggesting a role for selection acting on several genes thereby maintaining linkage disequilibrium among the 36 associated SNPs. The region carries numerous genes involved in sex differentiation in other taxa, including transformer2 and sox9. Taken together, the region determining the NMP phenotype shows characteristics of a sex-related supergene, suggesting that LG3 is potentially an incipient W chromosome despite the lack of significant additional restriction of recombination between Z and W. The occurrence of the female-determining locus in a pre-existing low recombining region illustrates one possible form of recombination suppression in sex chromosomes. D. magna is a promising model for studying the evolutionary transitions from ESD to GSD and early sex chromosome evolution.",

This stochastic model provides accurate, one-parameter characterizations of 2210 nuclear and mitochondrial genomes represented with > 104 codons/genome in CUTG.

Here we demonstrate that overexpression of DHFR in E. coli causes toxic metabolic imbalance triggered by interactions with several enzymes involved in 1-carbon metabolism, in particular GlyA and PurH. DHFR overexpression partially inhibits activity of these enzymes, but at physiological concentrations, PurH-DHFR interaction enhances catalytic efficiency of DHFR, implying a functional interaction in vivo. Surprisingly, overexpression of orthologous DHFRs from other bacterial species caused minimal metabolic and fitness perturbations, despite pulling out more interacting partners than overexpressed endogenous DHFR. Orthologous DHFRs were less potent in inhibiting E. coli GlyA and PurH, or gaining a catalytic improvement upon interaction with PurH, indicating a partial loss of interaction specificity due to evolutionary divergence. This study shows how protein overexpression perturbs a dynamic network of weak yet potentially functional PPI with consequences for the metabolic state of cells and their fitness.",

    "abstract": "Genetic data are known to harbor information about human demographics, and genotyping data are commonly used for capturing ancestry information by leveraging genome-wide differences between populations. In contrast, it is not clear to what extent population structure is captured by whole-genome DNA methylation data. We demonstrate, using three large cohort 450K methylation array data sets, that ancestry information signal is mirrored in genome-wide DNA methylation data, and that it can be further isolated more effectively by leveraging the correlation structure of CpGs with cis-located SNPs. Based on these insights, we propose a method, EPISTRUCTURE, for the inference of ancestry from methylation data, without the need for genotype data. EPISTRUCTURE can be used to infer ancestry information of individuals based on their methylation data in the absence of corresponding genetic data. Although genetic data are often collected in epigenetic studies of large cohorts, these are typically not made publicly available, making the application of EPISTRUCTURE especially useful for anyone working on public data. Implementation of EPISTRUCTURE is available in GLINT, our recently released toolset for DNA methylation analysis at: http://glint-epigenetics.readthedocs.io.",

Ars operon studies have revealed reduction of arsenate As(V) to arsenite As(III) by respiratory-chain-linked reductase enzyme complexes. Although structure of some bacterial arsenate reductases has been solved but not attempted for Bifidobacterium longum DJO10A colonizing the human gastrointestinal tract. Here it has been endeavoured to analyze and understand the structure, properties, interaction, evolution and action mechanism of this enzyme (arsC1) and its accessory interactors (arsB1, arsB2 and arsR). A systematic bioinformatic based analysis was carried out using a battery of tools and web servers for this purpose. Arsenic resistance gene cluster of gram-positive Bifidobacterium obtained from STRING database illustrated contiguous arsC and arsB genes and absence of arsA gene. ArsC1 was determined to be a cytoplasmic small-molecular-mass protein (~15 kDa) related to a class of tyrosine phosphatases mediating the reduction of As(V) to As(III). ArsC1 was found to be involved in dephosphorylation of arsR, arsB1 and arsB2, indicating its role in post translational modification (PTM) of interacting proteins. 3D structure analysis revealed that it was composed of 1 sheet,1 beta alpha beta unit, 4 strands, 5 helices, 3 helix-helix interacs, 13 beta turns and 1 gamma turn. All proteins in the cluster exhibited hydrophobic interactions.

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis (NF1) is a rare genetic neurologic disorder with over 30 distinct clinical manifestations, the top 3 of which include cafe-au-lait spotting, benign tumors and abnormal freckling. Pseudarthrosis (PA), also known as a \\\"false joint,\\\" is a rare subset of NF1 symptomology, characterized by bone fractures and nonunion caused by severe bowing of long bones. To date, it is invariably reported as secondary to NF1, commonly at 24 months of age. Here we describe a 4-month old infant who presented with PA as primary symptom, and in absence of an NF1 first-degree relative. Initial manifestation was guarding of the leg and increased irritability upon palpation of the knee, subsequent to light playful jostling. Physician examination revealed gross anterolateral bowing of the left leg. Radiography confirmed tibia-fibula bowing and pathologic transverse fracture at tibia diaphysis, characteristic of PA. Cafe-au-lait spots developed at 6 months subsequent to PA, but with number and size well below the National Institutes of Health criteria for NF1 diagnosis. At 14 months, exome sequencing established definitive NF1 diagnosis. Treatment involved PA takedown surgery. Although healing was seen after 2 months, complications emerged by 6 months. This case suggests that for primary PA without clear etiology, first-contact and consulting physicians should pay careful attention and be vigilant to timing of clinical onset and severity. Early, severe primary PA warrants accelerated NF1 exome sequencing, suggesting expansion of existing federal guidelines may be necessary to improve detection and prognosis of this rare, debilitating but readily managed condition.\\n\\nFinancial DisclosureThe authors have no financial relationships relevant to this article to disclose\\n\\nConflict of InterestThe authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose\\n\\nClinical Trial RegistrationNA",

    "abstract": "One of the major advantages of whole brain fMRI is the detection of large scale cortical networks. Dependent Components Analysis (DCA) is a novel approach designed to extract both cortical networks and their dependency structure. DCA is fundamentally different from prevalent data driven approaches, i.e. spatial ICA, in that instead of maximizing the independence of components it optimizes their dependency (in a tree graph structure, tDCA) depicting cortical areas as part of multiple cortical networks. Here tDCA was shown to reliably detect large scale functional networks in single subjects and in group analysis, by clustering non-noisy components on one branch of the tree structure. We used tDCA in three fMRI experiments in which identical auditory and visual stimuli were presented, but novelty information and task relevance were modified. tDCA components tended to include two anticorrelated networks, which were detected in two separate ICA components, or belonged in one component in seed functional connectivity. Although sensory components remained the same across experiments, other components changed as a function of the experimental conditions. These changes were either within component, where it encompassed other cortical areas, or between components, where the pattern of anticorrelated networks and their statistical dependency changed. Thus tDCA may prove to be a useful, robust tool that provides a rich description of the statistical structure underlying brain activity and its relationships to changes in experimental conditions. This tool may prove effective in detection and description of mental states, neural disorders and their dynamics.",

PacBio third-generation sequencing technology produces significantly longer reads than earlier second-generation sequencing technologies, which gives valuable information about longer exon chains in a graph. However, with the high error rates of third-generation sequencing, aligning long reads correctly around the splice sites is a challenging task. Incorrect alignments lead to spurious nodes and arcs in the graph, which in turn lead to incorrect transcript predictions.\\n\\nResultsWe survey several approaches to find the exon chains corresponding to long reads in a splicing graph, and experimentally study the performance of these methods using simulated data to allow for sensitivity / precision analysis. Our experiments show that short reads from second-generation sequencing can be used to significantly improve exon chain correctness either by error-correcting the long reads before splicing graph creation, or by using them to create a splicing graph on which the long read alignments are then projected. We also study the memory and time consumption of various modules, and show that accurate exon chains lead to significantly increased transcript prediction accuracy.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe simulated data and in-house scripts used for this article are available at http://cs.helsinki.fi/u/aekuosma/exon_chain_evaluation_publish.tar.gz.",

They contain many biologically and immunologically active molecules that might be involved in the development of these diseases. We examined the effect of different cultivating media supplemented with autologous serum and two types of plasma obtained from heparin and EDTA coated tubes on monocyte-derived dendritic cells viability. Our results show that medium with plasma from EDTA coated tubes is unsuitable for cultivation of myeloid cells due to the absence of bivalent ions and that the type of sampling tubes used for blood collection might be critical for successful experiment.",

This study evaluates total T lymphocyte and CD4 lymphocyte counts among women on DMPA and compares this to matched controls that were not on hormonal contraception.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsThis case control study was conducted in the western Kenya city of Kisumu. Participants were WHO stage I and II ART naive HIV-positive women. The cases were enrolled in the institutional family planning clinic and must have had an intramuscular injection of DMPA within a three month period. We used a standard provider initiated questionnaire to collect social and demographic information. Peripheral blood CD 3 and CD 4 lymphocyte counts were determined using BD-Facs-count . Data was entered and analysed using SPSS(R) Version 17.\\n\\nResultsA total of 138 participants were recruited into the study, 66 controls and 54 cases. The median ages were 26 and 28 respectively. The median CD 3 lymphocyte counts among controls and cases were 1628 and (p=0.004) while median CD4 lymphocyte counts are 649 (p=0.02).\\n\\nConclusionUse of the progestin DMPA is associated with an increase in median in CD3 and CD 4 I lymphocyte counts. Although the clinical benefits of this increase is unclear, DMPA is safe for use among women living with HIV.",

    "abstract": "Humans often evaluate sensory signals according to their reliability for optimal decision-making. However, how do we evaluate percepts generated in the absence of direct input that are, therefore, completely unreliable? Here, we utilize the phenomenon of filling-in occurring at the physiological blind-spots to compare partially inferred and veridical percepts. Subjects chose between stimuli that elicit filling-in, and perceptually equivalent ones presented outside the blind-spots, looking for a Gabor stimulus without a small orthogonal inset. In ambiguous conditions, when the stimuli were physically identical and the inset was absent in both, subjects behaved opposite to optimal, preferring the blind-spot stimulus as the better example of a collinear stimulus, even though no relevant veridical information was available. Thus, a percept that is partially inferred is paradoxically considered more reliable than a percept based on external input. In other words: Humans treat filled-in inferred percepts as more real than veridical ones.",

Characterisation of animal genetic resources provides relevant data for their conservation and sustainable use for food security and economic development. We investigated the origin and phylogenetic status of the local ADP of Ghana and their crosses with modern commercial breeds based on mtDNA, MC1R and Y-chromosome sequence polymorphisms, as well as genome-wide SNP genotyping.\\n\\nThe study involved 164 local pigs sampled from the three agro-ecological zones of Ghana. Analyses of the mitochondrial D-loop region and Y-chromosome sequences revealed both European and Asian genetic signatures, with differences between the geographical zones. Black coat colour is the most predominant within the breed, with dominant black MC1R alleles of both Asian and European origin contributing. European alleles for spotting are present at a low frequency in the sample set, and may account for the occurrence of spotted piglets in some APD litters. PCA analysis of SNP data revealed a strong location and breed effect on clustering of local Ghanaian pigs. On a global level, Ghanaian local pigs cluster closely with European pigs of commercial origin, such as the Large White.\\n\\nThe presence of both European and Asian contributions, with differences between geographical zones probably reflects trading and colonial influences.. Understanding the effects of admixture on important adaptive and economic traits of the ADP and other local breeds in Africa is critical for developing sustainable conservation programmes to prevent the decline of these genetic resources.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMalaria control efforts are stifled by the emergence and dispersal of parasite strains resistant to available anti-malarials. Amino acid changes in specific positions of proteins encoded by Plasmodium falciparum genes pfcrt, dhps, dhfr, and pfmdr1 are used as molecular markers of resistance to antimalarials such as chloroquine, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, as well as artemisinin derivatives. However, a challenge to the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in codons responsible for these amino acid changes, in several samples, is the scarcity of automated computational pipelines for molecular biologists to; rapidly analyze ABI (Applied Biosystems) Sanger sequencing data spanning the codons of interest in order to characterize these codons and detect these molecular markers of drug resistance. The pipeline described here is an attempt to address this need.\\n\\nMethodThis pipeline is a combination of existing tools, notably SAMtools and Burrows Wheeler Aligner (BWA), as well as custom Python and BASH scripts. It is designed to run on the UNIX shell, a command line interpreter. To characterize the codons associated with anti-malarial drug resistance (ADR) in a particular gene using this pipeline, the following options are required; a path to reference coding sequence of the gene in FASTA format, gene symbol (pfcrt, pfmdr1, dhps or dhfr), and a path to the directory of ABI sequencing trace files for the samples. With these inputs, the pipeline performs base calling and trimming, sequence alignment, and alignment parsing.\\n\\nResultsThe output of the pipeline is a CSV (Comma-separated values) file of sample names, codons and their corresponding encoded amino acids. The data generated can be readily analyzed using widely available statistical or spreadsheet software, to determine the frequency of molecular markers of resistance to anti-malarials such as chloroquine, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and artemisinin derivatives.\\n\\nConclusionsADRes is a quick and effective pipeline for detecting common molecular markers of anti-malarial drug resistance, and could be a useful tool for surveillance.

    "abstract": "The ability of a genotype to show diverse phenotypes in different environments is called phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity helps populations to evade extinctions in novel environments, facilitates adaptation and fuels evolution. However, most studies focus on understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic regulation in specific environments. As a result, while its evolutionary relevance is well established, genetic mechanisms regulating phenotypic plasticity and their overlap with the environment specific regulators is not well understood. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is highly sensitive to the environment, which acts as not just external stimulus but also as signalling cue for this unicellular, sessile organism. We used a previously published dataset of a biparental yeast population grown in 34 diverse environments and mapped genetic loci regulating variation in phenotypic plasticity, plasticity QTL, and compared them with environment-specific QTL. Plasticity QTL is one whose one allele exhibits high plasticity whereas the other shows a relatively canalised behaviour. We mapped phenotypic plasticity using two parameters - environmental variance, an environmental order-independent parameter and reaction norm (slope), an environmental order-dependent parameter. Our results show a partial overlap between pleiotropic QTL and plasticity QTL such that while some plasticity QTL are also pleiotropic, others have a significant effect on phenotypic plasticity without being significant in any environment independently. Furthermore, while some plasticity QTL are revealed only in specific environmental orders, we identify large effect plasticity QTL, which are order-independent such that whatever the order of the environments, one allele is always plastic and the other is canalised. Finally, we show that the environments can be divided into two categories based on the phenotypic diversity of the population within them and the two categories have differential regulators of phenotypic plasticity. Our results highlight the importance of identifying genetic regulators of phenotypic plasticity to comprehensively understand the genotype-phenotype map.",

    "abstract": "Body-schema, or the multimodal representation of ones own body attributes, has been demonstrated previously to be malleable. In the rubber-hand illusion (Botvinick & Cohen, 1998), synchronous visual and tactile stimulation cause a fake hand to be perceived as ones own. Similarly, if a strangers voice is heard synchronously with ones own vocal production, that voice comes to be attributed to oneself (Zheng et al., 2011). Multimodal illusions like these involve distorting body schema based on correlated input, yet the degree to which different instances of distortion are perceived within the same individuals has never been examined. Here we show that participants embraced the ownership of a fake hand and a strangers voice to a similar degree, controlling both for individual suggestibility and for general susceptibility to illusion of body schema. Our findings suggest that the perceptual inference that leads to the distortion of body schema is a stable trait.",

    "abstract": "The identification of axonal mRNAs in model organisms has led to the discovery of multiple proteins synthesized within axons for functional roles such as axon guidance and injury response. The extent to which protein synthesis within the axon is conserved in humans is unknown. Here we used axon-isolating microfluidic chambers to characterize the axonal transcriptome of human embryonic stem cells (hESC-neurons) differentiated using a protocol for glutamatergic neurons. Using gene expression analysis, we identified mRNAs proportionally enriched in axons, representing a functionally unique local transcriptome as compared to the human neuronal transcriptome inclusive of somata and dendrites. Further, we found that the most abundant mRNAs within hESC-neuron axons were functionally similar to the axonal transcriptome of rat cortical neurons. We confirmed the presence of two well characterized axonal mRNAs in model organisms, {beta}-actin and GAP43, within hESC-neuron axons using multiplexed single molecule RNA-FISH. Additionally, we report the novel finding that oxytocin mRNA localized to these human axons and confirmed its localization using RNA-FISH. This new evaluation of mRNA within human axons provides an important resource for studying local mRNA translation and has the potential to reveal both conserved and unique axonal mechanisms across species and neuronal types.",

To define the proteome of a live animal with tissue and subcellular resolution, we adapted a localized proteomics technology for use in the multicellular model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. This approach couples tissue- and location-specific expression of the enzyme ascorbate peroxidase (APX), which facilitates proximity-based protein labeling in vivo, and quantitative proteomics to identify tissue- and subcellular-restricted proteomes. We identified and localized over 3000 proteins from strains of C. elegans expressing APX in either the nucleus or cytoplasm of the intestine, epidermis, body wall muscle, or pharyngeal muscle. We also identified several hundred proteins that were specifically localized to one of the four tissues analyzed or specifically localized to the cytoplasm or the nucleus. This approach resulted in the identification of both previously characterized and unknown nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Further, we confirmed the tissue- and subcellular-specific localization of a subset of identified proteins using GFP-tagging and fluorescence microscopy, validating our in vivo proximity-based proteomics technique. Together, these results demonstrate a new approach that enables the tissue- and subcellular-specific identification and quantification of proteins within a live animal.",

In exploring how Drosophila melanogaster acquires its microbiome, we found that a microbial community influences Drosophila olfactory and egg-laying behaviors differently than individual members. Drosophila prefers a Saccharomyces-Acetobacter co-culture to the same microorganisms grown individually and then mixed, a response mainly due to the conserved olfactory receptor, Or42b. Acetobacter metabolism of Saccharomyces-derived ethanol was necessary, and acetate and its metabolic derivatives were sufficient, for co-culture preference. Preference correlated with three emergent co-culture properties: ethanol catabolism, a distinct volatile emission profile, and yeast population decline. We describe a molecular mechanism by which a microbial community affects animal behavior. Our results support a model whereby emergent metabolites signal Drosophila to acquire its preferred multispecies microbiome.",

In contrast to the classical tenet that ALS represents the outcome of extensive and progressive impairment of a fixed set of motor connections, recent neuroimaging findings suggest that the disease spreads along vast non-motor connections. Here, we hypothesised that functional network topology is perturbed in ALS, and that this reorganisation is associated with disability. We tested this hypothesis in 21 patients affected by ALS at several stages of impairment using resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and compared the results to 16 age-matched healthy controls. We estimated functional connectivity using the Phase Lag Index (PLI), and characterized the network topology using the minimum spanning tree (MST). We found a significant difference between groups in terms of MST dissimilarity and MST leaf fraction in the beta band. Moreover, some MST parameters (leaf, hierarchy and kappa) significantly correlated with disability. These findings suggest that the topology of resting-state functional networks in ALS is affected by the disease in relation to disability. EEG network analysis may be of help in monitoring and evaluating the clinical status of ALS patients.",

    "abstract": "Transcription Factor (TF) databases contain multitudes of motifs from various sources, from which non-redundant collections are derived by manual curation. The advent of high-throughput methods stimulated the production of novel collections with increasing numbers of motifs. Meta-databases, built by merging these collections, contain redundant versions, because available tools are not suited to automatically identify and explore biologically relevant clusters among thousands of motifs. Motif discovery from genome-scale data sets (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks) also produces redundant motifs, hampering the interpretation of results. We present matrix-clustering, a versatile tool that clusters similar TFBMs into multiple trees, and automatically creates non-redundant collections of motifs. A feature unique to matrix-clustering is its dynamic visualisation of aligned TFBMs, and its capability to simultaneously treat multiple collections from various sources. We demonstrate that matrix-clustering considerably simplifies the interpretation of combined results from multiple motif discovery tools and highlights biologically relevant variations of similar motifs. By clustering 24 entire databases (>7,500 motifs), we show that matrix-clustering correctly groups motifs belonging to the same TF families, and can drastically reduce motif redundancy. matrix-clustering is integrated within the RSAT suite (http://rsat.eu/), accessible through a user-friendly web interface or command-line for its integration in pipelines.",

To address this, we evolve genetically diverse populations of budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, consisting of diploid cells with unique haplotype combinations. We study the asexual evolution of these populations under selective inhibition with chemotherapeutic drugs by time-resolved whole-genome sequencing and phenotyping. All populations undergo clonal expansions driven by de novo mutations, but remain genetically and phenotypically diverse. The clones exhibit widespread genomic instability, rendering recessive de novo mutations homozygous and refining pre-existing variation. Finally, we decompose the fitness contributions of pre-existing and de novo mutations by creating a large recombinant library of adaptive mutations in an ensemble of genetic backgrounds. Both pre-existing and de novo mutations substantially contribute to fitness, and the relative fitness of pre-existing variants sets a selective threshold for new adaptive mutations.",
