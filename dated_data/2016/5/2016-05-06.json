    "abstract": "The detection of genomic regions involved in local adaptation is an important topic in current population genetics. There are several detection strategies available depending on the kind of genetic and demographic information at hand. A common drawback is the high risk of false positives. In this study, we introduce two complementary methods for the detection of divergent selection from populations connected by migration. Both methods have been developed with the aim of being robust to false positives. The first method combines haplotype information with inter-population differentiation (FST). Evidence of divergent selection is concluded only when both the haplotype pattern and the FST value support it. The second method is developed for independently segregating markers i.e. there is no haplotype information at hand. In this case, the power to detect selection is attained by developing a new outlier test based on detecting a bimodal distribution. The test computes the FST outliers and then assumes that those of interest would have a different mode which is detected by a clustering algorithm. The utility of the two methods is demonstrated through simulations and the analysis of real data. The simulation results show power ranging from 60-94% in several of the scenarios whilst the false positive rate is controlled below the nominal level in every scenario. The analysis of real samples consisted of phased data from the HapMap project and unphased data from intertidal marine snail ecotypes. The software HacDivSel implements the methods explained in this manuscript.",

    "abstract": "A critical assumption of gene expression analysis is that mRNA abundances broadly correlate with protein abundance, but these two are often imperfectly correlated. Some of the discrepancy can be accounted for by two important mRNA features: codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. We present a new global factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, and provide evidence that avoidance increases translational efficiency. We also demonstrate a strong selection for avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes, and that these have a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we demonstrate that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance. Therefore, taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance.",

    "abstract": "Despite progress in developing small molecule inhibitors, a quantitative understanding of drug action in the physiological context of cells is lacking. Here, we apply single-cell analysis of signal transduction and proliferation to probe cellular responses to small molecule inhibitors. We use the model of cellular activation of T lymphocytes responding to cytokines and antigens. We uncover two distinct modes of drug action, in terms of signaling inhibition: digital inhibition (e.g. when the fraction of activated cells diminishes upon drug treatment, but cells remaining active appear unperturbed), and analog inhibition (e.g. when the fraction of activated cells is unperturbed while their overall activation is diminished). We introduce a computational model of the signaling cascade in order to account for such dichotomy. We test the predictions of our model in terms of the phenotypic variability of cellular responses under drug inhibition. Finally, we demonstrate that the digital/analog dichotomy of cellular response as revealed on short timescales with signal transduction, translates into similar dichotomy on long timescales. Overall, our analysis of drug action at the single cell level illustrates the strength of quantitative approaches to translate the promise of in vitro pharmacology into functionally-relevant cellular settings.",

Previous analyses have found evidence for an ancient duplication or possibly triplication in the early evolutionary history of the family. We sought to better place this paleopolyploidy in the phylogeny and assess its nature.\\n\\nMethodsWe sequenced new transcriptomes for Barnadesia, the lineage sister to all other Compositae, and four representatives of closely related families. Using a recently developed algorithm, MAPS, we analyzed nuclear gene family phylogenies for evidence of paleopolyploidy.\\n\\nKey resultsWe found that the previously recognized Compositae paleopolyploidy is also in the ancestry of the Calyceraceae. Our phylogenomic analyses uncovered evidence for a successive second round of genome duplication among all sampled Compositae except Barnadesia.\\n\\nConclusionsOur analyses of new samples with new tools provide a revised view of paleopolyploidy in the Compositae. Together with results from recent linkage maps, our results suggest that the Compositae and Calyceraceae have a common paleotetraploid ancestor and most Compositae are descendants of a paleohexaploid. Although paleohexaploids have been previously identified, this is the first example where the paleotetraploid and paleohexaploid lineages have survived over tens of millions of years. The complex polyploidy in the ancestry of the Compositae and Calyceraceae represents a unique opportunity to study the long-term evolutionary fates and consequences of different ploidal levels.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlternative splicing is the major post-transcriptional mechanism by which gene expression is regulated and affects a wide range of processes and responses in most eukaryotic organisms. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) can generate genome-wide quantification of individual transcript isoforms to identify changes in expression and alternative splicing. RNA-seq is an essential modern tool but its ability to accurately quantify transcript isoforms depends on the diversity, completeness and quality of the transcript information.\\n\\nResultsWe have developed a new Reference Transcript Dataset for Arabidopsis (AtRTD2) for RNA-seq analysis containing over 82k non-redundant transcripts, whereby 74,194 transcripts originate from 27,667 protein-coding genes. A total of 13,524 protein-coding genes have at least one alternatively spliced transcript in AtRTD2 such that about 60% of the 22,453 protein-coding, intron-containing genes in Arabidopsis undergo alternative splicing. More than 600 putative U12 introns were identified in more than 2,000 transcripts. AtRTD2 was generated from transcript assemblies of ca. 8.5 billion pairs of reads from 285 RNA-seq data sets obtained from 129 RNA-seq libraries and merged along with the previous version, AtRTD, and Araport11 transcript assemblies. AtRTD2 increases the diversity of transcripts and through application of stringent filters represents the most extensive and accurate transcript collection for Arabidopsis to date. We have demonstrated a generally good correlation of alternative splicing ratios from RNA-seq data analysed by Salmon and experimental data from high resolution RT-PCR. However, we have observed inaccurate quantification of transcript isoforms for genes with multiple transcripts which have variation in the lengths of their UTRs. This variation is not effectively corrected in RNA-seq analysis programmes and will therefore impact RNA-seq analyses generally. To address this, we have tested different genome-wide modifications of AtRTD2 to improve transcript quantification and alternative splicing analysis. As a result, we release AtRTD2-QUASI specifically for use in Quantification of Alternatively Spliced Isoforms and demonstrate that it out-performs other available transcriptomes for RNA-seq analysis.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have generated a new transcriptome resource for RNA-seq analyses in Arabidopsis (AtRTD2) designed to address quantification of different isoforms and alternative splicing in gene expression studies. Experimental validation of alternative splicing changes identified inaccuracies in transcript quantification due to UTR length variation. To solve this problem, we also release a modified reference transcriptome, AtRTD2-QUASI for quantification of transcript isoforms, which shows high correlation with experimental data.",

Here we introduce high-yield methods for probing mouse visual decisions. Mice are head-fixed, which facilitates repeatable visual stimulation, eye tracking, and brain access. They turn a steering wheel to make two-alternative choices, forced or unforced. Learning is rapid thanks to intuitive coupling of stimuli to wheel position. The mouse decisions deliver high-quality psychometric curves for detection and discrimination, and conform to the predictions of a simple probabilistic observer model. The task is readily paired with two-photon imaging of cortical activity. Optogenetic inactivation reveals that the task requires the visual cortex. Mice are motivated to perform the task by fluid reward or optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic neurons. This stimulation elicits larger number of trials and faster learning. These methods provide a platform to accurately probe mouse vision and its neural basis.",

Bootstrap-based exploratory factor analysis was applied to 49 phenotypic subscales from 10 measures. Hybrid Hierarchical Clustering was applied to resultant factor scores to identify nested groups.

Multivariate Distance Matrix Regression examined functional connectome differences between adjacent groups.\\n\\nResultsReduction yielded six factors, which explained 77.8% and 65.4% of the variance in exploratory and constrained exploratory models, respectively. Hybrid Hierarchical Clustering of these 6 factors identified 2, 4, and 8 nested groups (i.e., phenotypic communities). At the highest clustering level, the algorithm differentiated functionally adaptive and maladaptive groups. At the middle clustering level, groups were separated by problem type (maladaptive groups; internalizing vs. externalizing problems) and behavioral type (adaptive groups; sensation-seeking vs. extraverted/emotionally stable). Unique phenotypic profiles were also evident at the lowest clustering level. Group comparisons exhibited significant differences in intrinsic functional connectivity at the highest clustering level in somatomotor, thalamic, basal ganglia, and limbic networks.\\n\\nConclusionsData-driven approaches for identifying homogenous subgroups, spanning typical function to dysfunction not only yielded clinically meaningful groups, but captured behavioral and neurobiological variation among healthy individuals as well.",

Since the tree topology for individual monogenic traits varies among the same set of organisms and does not overlap taxonomic hierarchy, hence there is a need to generate multidimensional phylogenetic trees.\\n\\nResultsPhylogenetic trees were constructed for 119 prokaryotes representing 2 phyla under Archaea and 11 phyla under Bacteria after comparing multiple sequence alignments for 15 different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase polypeptides. The topology of Neighbor Joining (NJ) trees for individual tRNA synthetase polypeptides varied substantially. We use Euclidean geometry to estimate all-pairs distances in order to construct phylogenetic trees. Further, we used a novel \\\"Taxonomic fidelity\\\" algorithm to estimate clade by clade similarity between the phylogenetic tree and the taxonomic tree. We find that, as compared to trees for individual tRNA synthetase polypeptides and rDNA sequences, the topology of our Euclidean tree and that for aligned and concatenated sequences of 15 proteins are closer to the taxonomic trees and offer the best consensus. We have also aligned sequences after concatenation, and find that by changing the order of sequence joining prior to alignment, the tree topologies vary. In contrast, changing the types of polypeptides in the grouping for Euclidean trees does not affect the tree topologies.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show that a consensus phylogenetic tree of 15 polypeptides from 14 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for 119 prokaryotes using Euclidean geometry exhibits better taxonomic fidelity than trees for individual tRNA synthetase polypeptides as well as 16S rDNA. We have also examined Euclidean N-dimensional trees for 15 tRNA synthetase polypeptides which give the same topology as that constructed after amalgamating 3-dimensional Euclidean trees for groups of 3 polypeptides. Euclidean N-dimensional trees offer a reliable future to multi-genic molecular phylogenetics.",

Analysis of diffusive behavior by tracking particles in live cells indicates that SLSs are >20 nm in diameter; furthermore, density measurements demonstrate that SLSs contain a mixture of lipids and proteins.

    "abstract": "Although previous studies have identified many extracellular guidance molecules and intracellular signaling proteins that regulate axonal outgrowth and extension, most were conducted in the context of unidirectional neurite growth, in which the guidance cues either attract or repel growth cones. Very few studies addressed how intracellular signaling molecules differentially specify bidirectional outgrowth. Here, using the bipolar PLM neurons in C. elegans, we show that the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) UNC-73/Trio and TIAM-1 promote anterior and posterior neurite extension, respectively. The Rac subfamily GTPases act downstream of the GEFs; CED-10/Rac1 is activated by TIAM-1, whereas CED-10 and MIG-2/RhoG act redundantly downstream of UNC-73. Moreover, these two pathways antagonize each other and, thus, regulate the directional bias of neuritogenesis. Our study suggests that directional specificity of neurite extension is conferred through the intracellular activation of distinct GEFs and Rac GTPases.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMost previous studies on intracellular signaling during neurite guidance were performed in the context of unidirectional neurite growth. They could not address the molecular basis of directional outgrowth of multiple neurites mainly because of the lack of a good model system. Using a pair of bipolar neurons in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we found that distinct sets of intracellular molecules are required for neurite extension towards the anterior and the posterior. Moreover, signaling pathways that promote neurite extension in different directions antagonize each other to achieve balanced growth. Therefore, our study offers an in vivo example for a long-standing concept that spatially selective activation of intracellular signaling molecules could enable a diverse range of neuronal growth patterns.",

The Bayesian approach, which does not depend on the knowledge of fetus DNA proportion in maternal plasma, provides accurate estimations on both real and simulated data; moreover, it is most robust than current methods in analyzing noisy or even erroneous data.",

    "abstract": "Humans suffering with chronic pain may have no evidence of a lesion or disease. They are managed with a morass of drugs and invasive procedures. In many, their persistent pain occurs after the healing of a soft tissue injury, with a neural source hypothesized. Opiates, commonly used to mitigate their symptoms, can cause an increase in neuropathic pain over time. Current animal models of neuropathic pain commonly create direct neural damage with open surgeries using ligatures, neurectomies, chemicals or other forms of intentional trauma. However, we have observed clinically that after an injury in humans, the naturally occurring process of tissue repair can cause chronic neural pain. We show here how the refined biomimetic NeuroDigm GELTM Model, in the mature male rat, gradually induces neuropathic pain behavior with a nonsurgical percutaneous injection of tissue-derived hydrogel in the tunnel of the distal tibial nerve. This perineural model creates a mononeuritis with the biogenic matrix induction of tissue remodeling, the last stage of tissue repair. Repeated behavioral analgesic testing over 5 months in the model implied a unique predictive validity for all analgesics tested. Morphine, initially effective, had an increase in pain behavior over time, suggesting an opioid-induced hyperalgesia, as seen in humans. Celecoxib produced no analgesia, while gabapentin and duloxetine at low doses had profound analgesia. Histology reveals focal neural remodeling, with neural regeneration, as in human biopsies. For the first time, targeted erythropoietin appears to heal neural pain, by extinguishing bilateral pain behavior present for over 4 months.\\n\\ntranslational model, neuropathic pain, erythropoietin, neural regeneration, soft tissue injuries, neuritis, tissue repair, hydrogel, animal model of disease, neural remodeling, age, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, morphine resistance, analgesics, refined pain model, matrix remodeling, neuroinflammation, predictive validity, habituation, estrogen",

    "abstract": "A growing literature suggests that the hippocampus is critical for the rapid extraction of regularities from the environment. Although this fits with the known role of the hippocampus in rapid learning, it seems at odds with the idea that the hippocampus specializes in memorizing individual episodes. In particular, the Complementary Learning Systems theory argues that there is a computational trade-off between learning the specifics of individual experiences and regularities that hold across those experiences. We asked whether it is possible for the hippocampus to handle both statistical learning and memorization of individual episodes. We exposed a neural network model that instantiates known properties of hippocampal projections and subfields to sequences of items with temporal regularities. We found that the monosynaptic pathway -- the pathway connecting entorhinal cortex directly to region CA1 -- was able to support statistical learning, while the trisynaptic pathway -- connecting entorhinal cortex to CA1 through dentate gyrus and CA3 -- learned only individual episodes, with apparent representations of regularities resulting from associative reactivation through recurrence. Thus, in paradigms involving rapid learning, the computational trade-off between learning episodes and regularities may be handled by separate anatomical pathways within the hippocampus itself.",

    "abstract": "The common approach in morphological analysis of dendritic spines is to categorize spines into subpopulations based on whether they are stubby, mushroom, thin, or filopodia. Corresponding cellular models of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation, and long-term depression associate synaptic strength with either spine enlargement or spine shrinkage. Although a variety of automatic spine segmentation and feature extraction methods were developed recently, no approaches allowing for an automatic and unbiased distinction between dendritic spine subpopulations and detailed computational models of spine behavior exist.\\n\\nWe propose an automatic and statistically based method for the unsupervised construction of spine shape taxonomy based on arbitrary features. The taxonomy is then utilized in the newly introduced computational model of behavior, which relies on transitions between shapes. Models of different populations are compared using supplied bootstrap-based statistical tests.\\n\\nWe compared two populations of spines at two time points. The first population was stimulated with long-term potentiation, and the other in the resting state was used as a control. The comparison of shape transition characteristics allowed us to identify differences between population behaviors. Although some extreme changes were observed in the stimulated population, statistically significant differences were found only when whole models were compared. Therefore, we hypothesize that the learning process is related to the subtle changes in the whole ensemble of different dendritic spine structures, but not at the level of single shape classes.\\n\\nThe source code of our software is freely available for non-commercial use1.",
