    "abstract": "DNA sampled from the environment (eDNA) is becoming a game changer for uncovering biodiversity patterns. By combining a conceptual model and empirical data, we test whether eDNA transported in river networks can be used as an integrative way to assess eukaryotic biodiversity for broad spatial scales and across the land-water interface. Using an eDNA metabarcode approach we detected 296 families of eukaryotes, spanning 19 phyla across the catchment of a river. We show for a subset of these families that eDNA samples overcome spatial autocorrelation biases associated with classical community assessments by integrating biodiversity information over space. Additionally, we demonstrate that many terrestrial species can be detected; thus revealing that eDNA in river-water also incorporates biodiversity information across terrestrial and aquatic biomes. Environmental DNA transported in river networks offers a novel and spatially integrated way to assess total biodiversity for whole landscapes and will transform biodiversity data acquisition in ecology.\\n\\n\\\"Eventually, all things merge into one, 32 and a river runs through it.\\\" -- Norman Maclean",

    "abstract": "Although the cost of high-throughput DNA sequencing continues to drop, extensively characterizing a given cell type using assays such as ChIP-seq and DNase-seq is still expensive. As a result, epigenomic characterization of a cell type is typically carried out using a small panel of assay types. Deciding a priori which assays to perform--e.g., a few complementary histone modification ChIP-seq experiments, perhaps an open chromatin assay, plus a few diverse transcription factor assays--is thus a critical step in many studies. Unfortunately, the field currently lacks a principled method for making these choices. We present submodular selection of assays (SSA), a method for choosing a diverse panel of genomic assays that leverages methods from the field of submodular optimization. We also describe a series of evaluation methods that allow us to measure the quality of a selected assay panel in the context of inference tasks such as data imputation, functional element prediction, and semi-automated genome annotation. Applying this evaluation framework to data from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics Consortia, we provide empirical evidence that SSA provides high quality panels of assays. The method is computationally efficient and is theoretically optimal under certain assumptions. SSA is extremely flexible, and can be employed to select assays for a new cell type or to select additional assays to be performed in a partially characterized cell type. More generally, this application serves as a model for how submodular optimization can be applied to other discrete problems in biology. SSA is available at http://melodi.ee.washington.edu/assay_panel_selection.html.",

    "abstract": "Plants have evolved elaborate mechanisms controlling developmental responses to environmental stimuli. A particularly important stimulus is temperature. Previous work has identified the interplay of PIF4 and ELF3 as a central circuit underlying thermal responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, thermal responses vary widely among strains, possibly offering mechanistic insights into the wiring of this circuit. ELF3 contains a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract that is crucial for ELF3 function and varies in length across strains. Here, we use transgenic analysis to test the hypothesis that natural polyQ variation in ELF3 is associated with the observed natural variation in thermomorphogenesis. We found little evidence that the polyQ tract plays a specific role in thermal responses beyond modulating general ELF3 function. Instead, we made the serendipitous discovery that ELF3 plays a crucial, PIF4-independent role in thermoresponsive flowering under conditions more likely to reflect field conditions. We present evidence that ELF3 acts through the photoperiodic pathway, pointing to a previously unknown symmetry between low and high ambient temperature responses. Moreover, in analyzing two strain backgrounds with vastly different thermal responses, we demonstrate that responses may be shifted rather than fundamentally rewired across strains. Our findings tie together disparate observations into a coherent framework in which multiple pathways converge in accelerating flowering in response to temperature, with some such pathways modulated by photoperiod.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) lineage identification and typing of clinical isolates in general is performed only retrospectively. The results are rarely linked to drug susceptibility testing (DST) or patient data. Consequently, the association between Mtb lineage, (multi)drug resistance and treatment history is not fully explored at the local level. Here we evaluated a new SNP based typing assay. We furthermore assessed the added value of genotyping of Mtb isolates for epidemiological purposes and guidance of tuberculosis (TB) control. Mtb lineage, DST profile and treatment history were determined for 399 samples at the National TB Reference Laboratory (NRL) in Tbilisi, Georgia by local staff. Data was shared electronically and analysis was performed remotely. Out of 399 isolates, 74 (74/399, 18.5%) were at least multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB, of which 63 (63/74, 85.1%) were members of three different Mtb Beijing lineages. Previous treatment was reported in 38/74 (51.4%) MDR(+) patients. The availability of this data allows associations with lineages. Notably, multidrug resistant TB was more strongly associated with the Beijing lineage than treatment history. Of all MDR-TB Beijing strains 56.7% (42/74) were members of a genetic cluster. This is most easily explained by (ongoing) MDR-TB transmission rather than drug resistance amplification. This knowledge is useful when designing intervention strategies for MDR-TB. Our study provides an example that on-site integrated Mtb genotyping is realistic and could support TB control activities.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSeveral recent studies have demonstrated that the bottom-up signaling of a visual stimulus is subserved by interareal gamma-band synchronization, whereas top-down influences are mediated by alpha-beta band synchronization. These processes may implement top-down control of stimulus processing if top-down and bottom-up mediating rhythms are coupled via cross-frequency interaction. To test this possibility, we investigated Granger-causal influences among awake male macaque primary visual area V1, higher visual area V4 and parietal control area 7a during attentional task performance. Top-down 7a-to-V1 beta-band influences enhanced visually driven V1-to-V4 gamma-band influences. This enhancement was spatially specific and largest when beta-band activity preceded gamma-band activity by [~]0.1 s, suggesting a causal effect of top-down processes on bottom-up processes. We propose that this cross-frequency interaction mechanistically subserves the attentional control of stimulus selection.\\n\\nSignificance StatementContemporary research indicates that the alpha-beta frequency band underlies top-down control, while the gamma-band mediates bottom-up stimulus processing. This arrangement inspires an attractive hypothesis, which posits that top-down beta-band influences directly modulate bottom-up gamma band influences via cross-frequency interaction. We evaluate this hypothesis determining that beta-band top-down influences from parietal area 7a to visual area V1 are correlated with bottom-up gamma frequency oscillations from V1 to area V4, in a spatially specific manner, and that this correlation is maximal when top-down activity precedes bottom-up activity. These results show that for top-down processes such as spatial attention, elevated top-down beta-band influences directly enhance feedforward stimulus induced gamma-band processing, leading to enhancement of the selected stimulus.",

    "abstract": "The coordinated regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level is fundamental to organismal development and homeostasis. Inducible systems are invaluable when studying transcription because the regulatory process can be triggered instantaneously, allowing the tracking of ordered mechanistic events. Here, we use Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq) to examine the genome-wide Heat Shock (HS) response in Drosophila and the function of two key transcription factors on the immediate transcription activation or repression of all genes regulated by HS. We identify the primary HS response genes and the rate-limiting steps in the transcription cycle that GAGA-Associated Factor (GAF) and HS Factor (HSF) regulate. We demonstrate that GAF acts upstream of promoter-proximally paused RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) formation, likely at the step of chromatin opening, and that GAF-facilitated Pol II pausing is critical for HS activation. In contrast, HSF is dispensable for establishing or maintaining Pol II pausing, but is critical for the release of paused Pol II into the gene body at a subset of highly-activated genes. Additionally, HSF has no detectable role in the rapid HS-repression of thousands of genes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe adoption of new bioinformatics webservers provides biological researchers with new analytical opportunities but also raises workflow challenges. These challenges include sharing collections of genes with collaborators, translating gene identifiers to the most appropriate nomenclature for each server, tracking these collections across multiple analysis tools and webservers, and maintaining effective records of the genes used in each analysis.\\n\\nDescriptionIn this paper, we present the Tribe webserver (available at https://tribe.greenelab.com), which addresses these challenges in order to make multi-server workflows seamless and reproducible. This allows users to create analysis pipelines that use their own sets of genes in combinations of specialized data mining webservers and tools while seamlessly maintaining gene set version control. Tribes web interface facilitates collaborative editing: users can share with collaborators, who can then view, download, and edit these collections. Tribes fully-featured API allows users to interact with Tribe programmatically if desired. Tribe implements the OAuth 2.0 standard as well as gene identifier mapping, which facilitates its integration into existing servers. Access to Tribes resources is facilitated by an easy-to-install Python application called tribe-client. We provide Tribe and tribe-client under a permissive open-source license to encourage others to download the source code and set up a local instance or to extend its capabilities.\\n\\nConclusionsThe Tribe webserver addresses challenges that have made reproducible multi-webserver workflows difficult to implement until now. It is open source, has a user-friendly web interface, and provides a means for researchers to perform reproducible gene set based analyses seamlessly across webservers and command line tools.",

In this study, we collected and analyzed a large number of GPS logs that tracked the movements of different livestock species in northwestern Kenya. Statistically principled analysis has only found limited evidence for the scale-free movement patterns of the Levy walk and its variants, even though most of the tracked movements clearly show super-diffusive behavior within the relevant temporal duration. Instead, the analysis has given strong support to composite exponential distributions (composite Brownian walks) as the best description of livestock movement trajectories in a wide array of parameter settings. Furthermore, this support has become overwhelming and near universal under an alternative criterion for model selection. These results illuminate the multi-scale and multi-modal nature of livestock spatial behavior. They also have broader theoretical and empirical implications for the related literature.",

In this investigation, we tackle this issue by showing how a multi-scale perspective can yield new insights. With the help of temperature-dependent statistical potentials, we analyzed some amino acid interactions at the molecular level, which are suggested to be relevant for the enhancement of thermal resistance. We then investigated the thermal stability at the protein level by quantifying its modification upon amino acid substitutions. Finally, a large scale analysis of protein stability - at the structurome level - contributed to the clarification of the relation between stability and natural evolution, thereby showing that the mutational profile of thermostable and mesostable proteins differ. Some final considerations on how the multi-scale approach could help unraveling the protein stability mechanisms are briefly discussed.",

However, the animals psychology will coevolve, potentially limiting the influence and spread of parasitic behavior. I revisit prominent models of the evolution of social learning and introduce the possibility of parasitic behavior. First, I explore a courtship between primitive social learning and parasitic behavior. Parasitic behavior can spread, but selection on the host then reduces social learning and limits its importance. Both parties are frustrated. In the second part, I study a reconciliation dynamic in which social learning becomes strategic about who it partners with. In this model, parasitic behavior can become prevalent and substantially reduce host fitness. However, it may also evolve to be mutualistic and raise the mean fitness of the host organism. When this occurs, natural selection may favor psychological susceptibility to parasitic behavior. Both social learning and socially learned behavior can enjoy a happy ending.",

The very large sample size of the UK Biobank is ideal for detecting selection using population differentiation, and enables an analysis of UK population structure at fine resolution. In analyses of 113,851 UK Biobank samples, population structure in the UK is dominated by 5 principal components (PCs) spanning 6 clusters: Northern Ireland, Scotland, northern England, southern England, and two Welsh clusters. Analyses with ancient Eurasians show that populations in the northern UK have higher levels of Steppe ancestry, and that UK population structure cannot be explained as a simple mixture of Celts and Saxons. A scan for unusual population differentiation along top PCs identified a genome-wide significant signal of selection at the coding variant rs601338 in FUT2 (p = 9.16 x 10-9). In addition, by combining evidence of unusual differentiation within the UK with evidence from ancient Eurasians, we identified new genome-wide significant (p < 5 x 10-8) signals of recent selection at two additional loci: CYP1A2/CSK and F12. We detected strong associations to diastolic blood pressure in the UK Biobank for the variants with new selection signals at CYP1A2/CSK (p = 1.10 x 10-19)) and for variants with ancient Eurasian selection signals in the ATXN2/SH2B3 locus (p = 8.00 x 10-33), implicating recent adaptation related to blood pressure.",

These GABAARs are highly expressed within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) where they influence the excitability of the medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Here we explore their role in modulating behavioural responses to reward-conditioned cues and the behaviour-potentiating effects of cocaine. 4-subunit constitutive knockout mice (4-/-) showed higher rates of instrumental responding for reward-paired stimuli in a test of conditioned reinforcement (CRf). A similar effect was seen following viral knockdown of GABAAR 4 subunits within the NAc. Local infusion of the {delta}-GABAAR-preferring agonist, THIP, into the NAc had no effect on responding when given alone, but reduced cocaine potentiation of responding for conditioned reinforcers in wildtype but not 4-/- mice. Finally, specific deletion of 4-subunits from dopamine D2-, but not D1-receptor-expressing neurons, mimicked the phenotype of the constitutive knockout, potentiating CRf responding and blocking intra-accumbal THIP attenuation of cocaine-potentiated CRf responding. These data demonstrate that 4-GABAAR mediated inhibition of dopamine D2 receptor-expressing neurons reduces instrumental-responding for a conditioned reinforcer, and its potentiation by cocaine, and emphasise the potential importance of GABAergic signalling within the NAc in mediating cocaines effects.",

In two patients, multiple resistance mutations accumulated at frequencies of 20% or less, including putative resistance mutations P522Q (UL54) and C480F (UL97). In one patient, resistance was detected 14 days earlier than by PCR. Phylogenetic analysis suggested recombination or superinfection in one patient.\\n\\nConclusionsDeep sequencing of HCMV enriched from clinical samples excluded resistance in 7 of eleven subjects and identified resistance mutations earlier than conventional PCR-based resistance testing in 2 patients. Detection of multiple low level resistance mutations was associated with poor outcome.",

    "abstract": "In computational proteomics, identification of peptides with an unlimited number of post-translational modification (PTM) types is a challenging task. The computational cost increases exponentially with respect to the number of modifiable amino acids and linearly with respect to the number of potential PTM types at each amino acid. The problem becomes intractable very quickly if we want to enumerate all possible modification patterns. Existing tools (e.g., MS-Alignment, ProteinProspector, and MODa) avoid enumerating modification patterns in database search by using an alignment-based approach to localize and characterize modified amino acids. This approach avoids enumerating all possible modification patterns in a database search. However, due to the large search space and PTM localization issue, the sensitivity of these tools is low. This paper proposes a novel method named PIPI to achieve PTM-invariant peptide identification. PIPI first codes peptide sequences into Boolean vectors and converts experimental spectra into real-valued vectors. Then, it finds the top 10 peptide-coded vectors for each spectrum-coded vector. After that, PIPI uses a dynamic programming algorithm to localize and characterize modified amino acids. Simulations and real data experiments have shown that PIPI outperforms existing tools by identifying more peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) and reporting fewer false positives. It also runs much faster than existing tools when the database is large.",

    "abstract": "Rapid and cost-effective genotyping of large mapping populations can be achieved by sequencing a reduced representation of the genome of every individual in a given population and using that information to generate genetic markers. A customized genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) pipeline was developed to genotype a rice F2 population from a cross of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare and the African wild rice species Oryza longistaminata. While most GBS pipelines aim to analyze mainly homozygous populations we attempted to genotype a highly heterozygous F2 population. We show how species-and population-specific improvements of established protocols can drastically increase sample throughput and genotype quality. Using as few as 50,000 reads for some individuals (134,000 reads on average) we were able to generate up to 8,154 informative SNP markers in 1,081 F2 individuals. Additionally, the effects of enzyme choice, read coverage and data post-processing are evaluated. Using GBS-derived markers we were able to assemble a genetic map of 1,536 cM. To demonstrate the usefulness of our GBS pipeline we determined QTL for the number of tillers. We were able to map four QTLs to chromosomes 1, 3, 4 and 8 and confirm their effects using introgression lines. We provide an example of how to successfully use GBS with heterozygous F2 populations. By using the comparatively low-cost MiSeq platform we show that the GBS method is flexible and cost-effective even for smaller laboratories",

However, a tool box for the analysis of EWAS and TWAS studies is largely lacking and often approaches from GWAS are applied despite the fact that epigenome and transcriptome data have vedifferent characteristics than genotypes. Here, we show that EWASs and TWASs are prone not only to significant inflation but also bias of the test statistics and that these are not properly addressed by GWAS-based methodology (i.e. genomic control) and state-of-the-art approaches to control for unmeasured confounding (i.e. RUV, sva and cate). We developed a novel approach that is based on the estimation of the empirical null distribution using Bayesian statistics. Using simulation studies and empirical data, we demonstrate that our approach maximizes power while properly controlling the false positive rate. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our method in the application of meta-analysis by performing EWASs and TWASs on age and smoking which highlighted an overlap in differential methylation and expression of associated genes. An implementation of our new method is available from http://bioconductor.org/packages/bacon/.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian transcriptomes are complex and formed by extensive promoter activity. In addition, gene promoters are largely divergent and initiate transcription of reverse-oriented promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs). Although PROMPTs are commonly terminated early, influenced by polyadenylation sites, promoters often cluster so that the divergent activity of one might impact another. Here, we find that the distance between promoters strongly correlates with the expression, stability and length of their associated PROMPTs. Adjacent promoters driving divergent mRNA transcription support PROMPT formation, but due to polyadenylation site constraints, these transcripts tend to spread into the neighboring mRNA on the same strand. This mechanism to derive new alternative mRNA transcription start sites (TSSs) is also evident at closely spaced promoters supporting convergent mRNA transcription. We suggest that basic building blocks of divergently transcribed core promoter pairs, in combination with the wealth of TSSs in mammalian genomes, provides a framework with which evolution shapes transcriptomes.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetric Notch signaling promotes divergent fates in select cells throughout metazoan development. In the receiving cell, signaling results in cleavage of the Notch intracellular domain and its import into the nucleus, where it binds Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] to promote gene expression in conjunction with contextual cues in the surrounding DNA sequence. To investigate the nature of this contextual logic, we identify 1344 Su(H)-site containing regulatory belts that are conserved across the Drosophila genus. Each Su(H)-type regulatory belt (SUH-RB) is a 0.6-1.0 kb chain of conservation peaks consistent with a transcriptional enhancer or core promoter. These regulatory belts contain one or more canonical binding sites for Su(H) along with ~15-30 other binding sites. SUH-RBs are densely clustered in certain chromosomal regions such as the E(spl)-complex, the Wnt gene complex, and genes encoding Notch receptor ligands (Delta and Serrate). SUH-RBs overlap most known Su(H)/Notch-target enhancers and others, including non-embryonic enhancers that are not identified by embryonic ChIP-seq peaks. Thus, SUH-RBs overcome the stage-specific nature of embryonic ChIP-seq peaks and suggest a pervasive role for contextual tissue-specific pioneer and/or enhancer-licensing factors. SUH-RBs also delineate false positive ChIP-seq peaks, which do not overlap SUH-RBs, are missing even the weakest Su(H)-binding sequences, and have the shortest ChIP peak widths. Last, we characterize several novel enhancers including Su(H)-dependent enhancers at Notch and Delta, intestinal enhancers at A2bp1 and hedgehog, and distinct enhancers at roughest, E2f1, and escargot.",

    "abstract": "Narrative reports suggest that socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with biogeographic ancestry (BGA) in the Americas. If so, SES potentially acts as a confound that needs to be taken into account when evaluating the relation between medical outcomes and BGA. To explore how systematic BGA-SES associations are, a meta-analysis of American studies was conducted. 41 studies were identified, yielding a total of 64 independent samples with directions of associations, including 48 independent samples with effect sizes. An analysis of association directions found a high degree of consistency. The square root n-weighted directions were 0.83 (K = 36), -0.81 (K = 41) and -0.82 (K = 39) for European, Amerindian and African BGA, respectively. An analysis of effect size magnitudes found that European BGA was positively associated with SES, with a meta-analytic effect size of r = .18 [95% CI: .13 to .24, K = 28, n = 35,476.50], while both Amerindian and African BGA were negatively associated with SES, having meta-analytic effect sizes of -.14 [-.18 to -.10, k =31, n = 28,937.50] and -.11 [-.15 to -.07, K = 28, n = 32,710.50], respectively. There was considerable cross-sample variation in effect sizes (mean I2 = 92%), but the sample size was not enough for performing credible moderator analysis.
