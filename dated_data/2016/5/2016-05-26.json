    "abstract": "An ecosystem is generally sustained by a set of integrated physical elements forming a functional landscape unit - ecotope, which supplies nutrients, microclimate, and exchanges matter and energy with the wider environment. To better predict environmental change effects on ecosystems, particularly in critically sensitive regions such as high altitudes, it is imperative to recognise how their natural landscape heterogeneity works at different scales to shape habitats and sustain biotic communities prior to major changes.\\n\\nWe conducted a comprehensive survey of catchment physical, geological and ecological properties of 380 high altitude lakes and ponds in the axial Pyrenees at a variety of scales, in order to formulate and test an integrated model encompassing major flows and interactions that drive lake ecosystems.\\n\\nThree composite drivers encompassed most of the variability in lake catchment characteristics. In order of total percentage of variance explained they were: (i) hydrology/hydrodynamics-responsible for type and discharge of inlets/outlets, and for water body size; (ii) bedrock geomorphology, summarizing geology, slope and fractal order-all dictating vegetation cover of catchment slope and lake shore, and the presence of aquatic vegetation; and, (iii) topography, i.e. catchment formation type-driving lakes connectivity, and the presence of summer snow deposits. While driver (i) appeared to be local, (ii) and (iii) showed gradient changes along altitude and latitude. These three drivers differentiated several lake ecotopes based on their landscape similarities. The three-driver model was successfully tested on a riparian vegetation composition dataset, further illustrating the validity and fundamental nature of the concept.\\n\\nThe findings inform on the relative contribution of scale-dependent catchment physical elements to lake ecotope and ecosystem formation in high altitude lakes, which should be considered in any assessment of potentially major deleterious effects due to environmental/climate change.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/034405_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (85K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4b92e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@198fca4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f2801dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b8f588_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Lake Bassia at 2275m a.s.l. in the Pyrenees National Park, France, is one of the millions of remote high altitude lakes worldwide whose catchments are likely to experience severe effects due to climate change.

    "abstract": "Patient interactions with health care providers result in entries to electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs were built for clinical and billing purposes but contain many data points about an individual. Mining these records provides opportunities to extract electronic phenotypes, which can be paired with genetic data to identify genes underlying common human diseases. This task remains challenging: high quality phenotyping is costly and requires physician review; many fields in the records are sparsely filled; and our definitions of diseases are continuing to improve over time. Here we develop and evaluate a semi-supervised learning method for EHR phenotype extraction using denoising autoencoders for phenotype stratification. By combining denoising autoencoders with random forests we find classification improvements across multiple simulation models and improved survival prediction in ALS clinical trial data. This is particularly evident in cases where only a small number of patients have high quality phenotypes, a common scenario in EHR-based research. Denoising autoencoders perform dimensionality reduction enabling visualization and clustering for the discovery of new subtypes of disease. This method represents a promising approach to clarify disease subtypes and improve genotype-phenotype association studies that leverage EHRs.\\n\\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/039800_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (31K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@567074org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f0e45corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1207659org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@39f8b8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LIDenoising autoencoders (DAs) can model electronic health records.\\nC_LIO_LISemi-supervised learning with DAs improves ALS patient survival predictions.\\nC_LIO_LIDAs improve patient cluster visualization through dimensionality reduction.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Invasive species represent unique opportunities to evaluate the role of local adaptation during colonization of new environments. Among these species, the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a threatening vector of several human viral diseases, including dengue and chikungunya, and raises concerns about the Zika fever. Its broad presence in both temperate and tropical environments has been considered the reflection of great \\\"ecological plasticity\\\". However, no study has been conducted to assess the role of adaptive evolution in the ecological success of Ae. albopictus at the molecular level. In the present study, we performed a genomic scan to search for potential signatures of selection leading to local adaptation in one-hundred-forty field-collected mosquitoes from native populations of Vietnam and temperate invasive populations of Europe. High-throughput genotyping of transposable element insertions led to the discovery of more than 120 000 polymorphic loci, which, in their great majority, revealed a virtual absence of structure between the bio-geographic areas. Nevertheless, 92 outlier loci showed a high level of differentiation between temperate and tropical populations. The majority of these loci segregates at high insertion frequencies among European populations, indicating that this pattern could have been caused by recent adaptive evolution events in temperate areas. An analysis of the overlapping and neighboring genes highlighted several candidates, including diapause, lipid and juvenile hormone pathways.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the ontogeny of light-driven responses in mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Using a large-scale, high-density multielectrode array, we recorded from hundreds to thousands of RGCs simultaneously at pan-retinal level, including dorsal and ventral locations. Responses to different contrasts not only revealed a complex developmental profile for ON, OFF and ON-OFF RGC types, but also unveiled differences between dorsal and ventral RGCs. At eye-opening, dorsal RGCs of all types were more responsive to light, perhaps indicating an environmental priority to nest viewing for pre-weaning pups. The developmental profile of ON and OFF RGCs exhibited antagonistic behavior, with the strongest ON responses shortly after eye-opening, followed by an increase in the strength of OFF responses later on. Further, we found that with maturation receptive field (RF) center sizes decrease, responses to light get stronger, and centers become more circular while seeing differences in all of them between RGC types. These findings show that retinal functionality is not spatially homogeneous, likely reflecting ecological requirements that favour the early development of dorsal retina, and reflecting different roles in vision in the mature animal.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila embryo transiently exhibits a double segment periodicity, defined by the expression of seven \\\"pair-rule\\\" genes, each in a pattern of seven stripes. At gastrulation, interactions between the pair-rule genes lead to frequency doubling and the patterning of fourteen parasegment boundaries. In contrast to earlier stages of Drosophila anteroposterior patterning, this transition is not well understood. By carefully analysing the spatiotemporal dynamics of pair-rule gene expression, we demonstrate that frequency-doubling is precipitated by multiple coordinated changes to the network of regulatory interactions between the pair-rule genes. We identify the broadly expressed but temporally patterned transcription factor, Odd-paired (Opa/Zic), as the cause of these changes, and show that the patterning of the even-numbered parasegment boundaries relies on Opa-dependent regulatory interactions. Our findings indicate that the pair-rule gene regulatory network has a temporally-modulated topology, permitting the pair-rule genes to play stage-specific patterning roles.",

We used haplotype transmission information to create a phased \\\"platinum\\\" variant catalogue of 4.7 million single nucleotide variants (SNVs) plus 0.7 million small (1-50bp) insertions and deletions (indels) that are consistent with the pattern of inheritance in the parents and eleven children of this pedigree. Platinum genotypes are highly concordant with the current catalogue of the National Institute of Standards and Technology for both SNVs (>99.99%) and indels (99.92%), and add a validated truth catalogue that has 26% more SNVs and 45% more indels. Analysis of 334,652 SNVs that were consistent between informatics pipelines yet inconsistent with haplotype transmission (\\\"non-platinum\\\") revealed that the majority of these variants are de novo and cell-line mutations or reside within previously unidentified duplications and deletions.

    "abstract": "The architecture of the mammalian brain has been characterized through decades of innovation in the field of network neuroscience. However, the assembly of the brain from progenitor cells is an immensely complex process, and a quantitative understanding of how neural progenitor cells (NPCs) form neural networks has proven elusive. Here, we introduce a method that integrates graph-theory with long-term imaging of differentiating human NPCs to characterize the evolution of spatial and functional network features in NPCs during the formation of neural networks in vitro. We find that the rise and fall in spatial network efficiency is a characteristic feature of the transition from immature NPC networks to mature neural networks. Furthermore, networks at intermediate stages of differentiation that display high spatial network efficiency also show high levels of network-wide spontaneous electrical activity. These results support the view that network-wide signaling in immature progenitor cells gives way to a hierarchical form of communication in mature neural networks. We also leverage graph theory to study the spatial features of individual cell types in developing cultures, uncovering spatial features of polarized neuroepithelium. Finally, we employ our method to uncover aberrant network features in a neurodevelopmental disorder using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models. The \\\"Living Neural Networks\\\" method bridges the gap between developmental neurobiology and network neuroscience, and offers insight into the relationship between developing and mature neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic methods have shown great promise in understanding the development of broadly neutralizing antibody lineages (bNAbs). However, mutational process for generating these lineages - somatic hypermutation (SHM) - is biased by hotspot motifs, which violates important assumptions in most phylogenetic substitution models. Here, we develop a modified GY94-type substitution model which partially accounts for this context-dependency while preserving independence of sites in calculation. This model shows a substantially better fit to three well-characterized bNAb lineages than the standard GY94 model. We show through simulations that accounting for this can lead to reduced bias of other substitution parameters, and more accurate ancestral state reconstructions. We further explore other implications of this model; namely, that the number of hotspot motifs - and therefore likely the mutation rate in general - is expected to decay over time in individual bNAb lineages.",

Evaluation of the genotoxicity of cell phone radiofrequency radiation in male and female rats and mice following subchronic exposure.\\n\\nSUMMARYThe purpose of this communication is to report partial findings from a series of radiofrequency radiation (RFR) cancer studies in rats performed under the auspices of the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP).1 This report contains peer-reviewed, neoplastic and hyperplastic findings only in the brain and heart of Hsd:Sprague Dawley(R) SD(R) (HSD) rats exposed to RFR starting in utero and continuing throughout their lifetimes. These studies found low incidences of malignant gliomas in the brain and schwannomas in the heart of male rats exposed to RFR of the two types [Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)] currently used in U.S. wireless networks. Potentially preneoplastic lesions were also observed in the brain and heart of male rats exposed to RFR.\\n\\nThe review of partial study data in this report has been prompted by several factors. Given the widespread global usage of mobile communications among users of all ages, even a very small increase in the incidence of disease resulting from exposure to RFR could have broad implications for public health. There is a high level of public and media interest regarding the safety of cell phone RFR and the specific results of these NTP studies. Lastly, the tumors in the brain and heart observed at low incidence in male rats exposed to GSM-and CDMA-modulated cell phone RFR in this study are of a type similar to tumors observed in some epidemiology studies of cell phone use. These findings appear to support the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) conclusions regarding the possible carcinogenic potential of RFR.2\\n\\nIt is important to note that this document reviews only the findings from the brain and heart and is not a complete report of all findings from the NTPs studies. Additional data from these studies in Hsd:Sprague Dawley(R) SD(R) (Harlan) rats and similar studies conducted in B6C3F1/N mice are currently under evaluation and will be reported together with the current findings in two forthcoming NTP Technical Reports.",

    "abstract": "There is a popular belief in neuroscience that we are primarily data limited, and that producing large, multimodal, and complex datasets will, with the help of advanced data analysis algorithms, lead to fundamental insights into the way the brain processes information. These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data. Additionally, we argue for scientists using complex non-linear dynamical systems with known ground truth, such as the microprocessor as a validation platform for time-series and structure discovery methods.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNeuroscience is held back by the fact that it is hard to evaluate if a conclusion is correct; the complexity of the systems under study and their experimental inaccessability make the assessment of algorithmic and data analytic technqiues challenging at best. We thus argue for testing approaches using known artifacts, where the correct interpretation is known. Here we present a microprocessor platform as one such test case. We find that many approaches in neuroscience, when used na*vely, fall short of producing a meaningful understanding.",

    "abstract": "For approximately 20 million people with drug-resistant epilepsy, recurring, spontaneous seizures have a devastating impact on daily life. The efficacy of surgical treatment for controlling seizures is hindered by a poor understanding of how some seizures spread to and synchronize surrounding tissue while others remain focal. To pinpoint network regions that regulate seizure evolution, we present a novel method to assess changes in synchronizability in response to virtually lesioning cortical areas in a validated computational network model. In human patients implanted with electrocorticographic sensors, we apply our virtual cortical resection technique to time-varying functional networks and identify control regions that synchronize or desynchronize cortical areas using an antagonistic push-pull control scheme to raise or lower synchronizability. Our results suggest that synchronizability before seizures predicts seizure evolution: in focal seizures, the strongest controllers are located outside seizure-generating areas. These methods,while applied here to epilepsy, are generalizable to other brain networks, and have wide applicability in isolating and mapping functional drivers of brain dynamics in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "The recent emergence of Zika in Brazil and its association with increased congenital malformation rates has raised concerns over its impact on the birth rates in the country. Using data on the incidence of Zika in 2015-2016 and dengue in 2013 and 2015-16 for the city of Rio de Janeiro (pop: 6.4 million), we document a massive increase of Zika in women compared to men. Even after correcting for the bias due to the systematic testing of pregnant women for Zika, there are 90% more registered cases per 100,000 women in the sexually active age group (15-65 years) than for men but not before 15 or after 65. Assuming that infected men transmit the disease to women in their semen but that the converse is not true, some extra incidence in women is to be expected. An alternate hypothesis would be that women visit doctors more often than men. To test this, we compared the incidence of dengue fever in men and women in 2015 and in 2013 (before Zika reached Rio de Janeiro): in both years, women are 30% more likely to be reported with dengue.\\n\\nSumming up, women in the sexually active age bracket are far more likely to get Zika than men (+90% increase); sexual transmission is the most probable cause. Women in the 15-65 age group are also 30% more likely to be reported with dengue than men, which is probably due to women being more careful with their health.",
