    "abstract": "Sharing of experimental clinical research data usually happens between individuals or research groups rather than via public repositories, in part due to the need to protect research participant privacy. This approach to data sharing makes it difficult to connect journal articles with their underlying datasets and is often insufficient for ensuring access to data in the long term. Voluntary data sharing services such as the Yale Open Data Access (YODA) and Clinical Study Data Request (CSDR) projects have increased accessibility to clinical datasets for secondary uses while protecting patient privacy and the legitimacy of secondary analyses but these resources are generally disconnected from journal articles - where researchers typically search for reliable information to inform future research. New scholarly journal and article types dedicated to increasing accessibility of research data have emerged in recent years and, in general, journals are developing stronger links with data repositories. There is a need for increased collaboration between journals, data repositories, researchers, funders, and voluntary data sharing services to increase the visibility and reliability of clinical research. We propose changes to the format and peer-review process for journal articles to more robustly link them to data that are only available on request. We also propose additional features for data repositories to better accommodate non-public clinical datasets, including Data Use Agreements (DUAs).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInsertions and deletions (indels) account for more nucleotide differences between two related DNA sequences than substitutions do, and thus it is imperative to develop a stochastic evolutionary model that enables us to reliably calculate the probability of the sequence evolution through indel processes. Recently, such probabilistic models are mostly based on either hidden Markov models (HMMs) or transducer theories, both of which give the indel component of the probability of a given sequence alignment as a product of either probabilities of column-to-column transitions or block-wise contributions along the alignment. However, it is not a priori clear how these models are related with any genuine stochastic evolutionary model, which describes the stochastic evolution of an entire sequence along the time-axis. Moreover, none of these models can fully accommodate biologically realistic features, such as overlapping indels, power-law indel-length distributions, and indel rate variation across regions.\\n\\nResultsHere, we theoretically tackle the ab initio calculation of the probability of a given sequence alignment under a genuine evolutionary model, more specifically, a general continuous-time Markov model of the evolution of an entire sequence via insertions and deletions. Our model allows general indel rate parameters including length distributions but does not impose any unrealistic restrictions on indels. Using techniques of the perturbation theory in physics, we expand the probability into a series over different numbers of indels. Our derivation of this perturbation expansion elegantly bridges the gap between Gillespies (1977) intuitive derivation of his own stochastic simulation method, which is now widely used in evolutionary simulators, and Fellers (1940) mathematically rigorous theorems that underpin Gillespie's method. We find a sufficient and nearly necessary set of conditions under which the probability can be expressed as the product of an overall factor and the contributions from regions separated by gapless columns of the alignment. The indel models satisfying these conditions include those with some kind of rate variation across regions, as well as space-homogeneous models. We also prove that, though with a caveat, pairwise probabilities calculated by the method of Miklos et al. (2004) are equivalent to those calculated by our ab initio formulation, at least under a space-homogenous model.\\n\\nConclusionsOur ab initio perturbative formulation provides a firm theoretical ground that other indel models can rest on.\\n\\n[This paper and three other papers (Ezawa, Graur and Landan 2015a,b,c) describe a series of our efforts to develop, apply, and extend the ab initio perturbative formulation of a general continuous-time Markov model of indels.]",

    "abstract": "Novel developmental programs often evolve via cooption of existing genetic networks. To understand this process, we explored cooption of the TAS3 tasiRNA pathway in the moss Physcomitrella patens. We find an ancestral function for this repeatedly redeployed pathway in the spatial regulation of a conserved set of Auxin Response Factors. In moss, this results in stochastic patterning of the filamentous protonemal tissue. Through modeling and experimentation, we demonstrate that tasiRNA regulation confers sensitivity and robustness onto the auxin response. Increased auxin sensitivity parallels increased developmental sensitivity to nitrogen, a key environmental signal. We propose that the properties lent to the auxin response network, along with the ability to stochastically modulate development in response to environmental cues, have contributed to the tasiRNA-ARF modules repeated cooption during evolution. The signaling properties of a genetic network, and not just its developmental output, are thus critical to understanding the evolution of multicellular forms.",

    "abstract": "Local non-linearities in dendrites render neuronal output dependent on the spatial distribution of synapses. A neuron will activate differently depending on whether active synapses are spatially clustered or dispersed. While this sensitivity can in principle expand neuronal computational capacity, it has thus far been employed in very few learning paradigms. To make use of this sensitivity, groups of correlated neurons need to make contact with distinct dendrites, and this requires a mechanism to ensure the correct distribution of synapses contacting from distinct ensembles. To address this problem, we introduce the requirement that on a short time scale, a pre-synaptic neuron makes a constant number of synapses with the same strength on a post-synaptic neuron. We find that this property enables clusters to distribute correctly and guarantees their functionality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a change in the input statistics can reshape the spatial distribution of synapses. Finally, we show under which conditions clusters do not distribute correctly, e.g. when cross-talk between dendrites is too strong. As well as providing insight into potential biological mechanisms of learning, this work paves the way for new learning algorithms for artificial neural networks that exploit the spatial distribution of synapses.",

    "abstract": "X-ray diffraction has the potential to provide rich information about the structural dynamics of macromolecules. To realize this potential, both Bragg scattering, which is currently used to derive macromolecular structures, and diffuse scattering, which reports on correlations in charge density variations must be measured. Until now measurement of diffuse scattering from protein crystals has been scarce, due to the extra effort of collecting diffuse data. Here, we present three-dimensional measurements of diffuse intensity collected from crystals of the enzymes cyclophilin A and trypsin. The measurements were obtained from the same X-ray diffraction images as the Bragg data, using best practices for standard data collection. To model the underlying dynamics in a practical way that could be used during structure refinement, we tested Translation-Libration-Screw (TLS), Liquid-Like Motions (LLM), and coarse-grained Normal Modes (NM) models of protein motions. The LLM model provides a global picture of motions and were refined against the diffuse data, while the TLS and NM models provide more detailed and distinct descriptions of atom displacements, and only used information from the Bragg data. Whereas different TLS groupings yielded similar Bragg intensities, they yielded different diffuse intensities, none of which agreed well with the data. In contrast, both the LLM and NM models agreed substantially with the diffuse data. These results demonstrate a realistic path to increase the number of diffuse datasets available to the wider biosciences community and indicate that NM-based refinement can generate dynamics-inspired structural models that simultaneously agree with both Bragg and diffuse scattering.\\n\\nSignificanceThe structural details of protein motions are critical to understanding many biological processes, but they are often hidden to conventional biophysical techniques. Diffuse X-ray scattering can reveal details of the correlated movements between atoms; however, the data collection historically has required extra effort and dedicated experimental protocols. We have measured three-dimensional diffuse intensities in X-ray diffraction from CypA and trypsin crystals using standard crystallographic data collection techniques. Analysis of the resulting data is consistent with the protein motions resembling diffusion in a liquid or vibrations of a soft solid. Our results show that using diffuse scattering to model protein motions can become a component of routine crystallographic analysis through the extension of commonplace methods.",

    "abstract": "The cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) is a macromolecular complex that facilitates the supply of release-ready synaptic vesicles to support neurotransmitter release at synapses. To reveal the dynamics of this supply process in living synapses, we used super-resolution imaging to track single vesicles at voltage-clamped presynaptic terminals of retinal bipolar neurons, whose CAZ contains a specialized structure--the synaptic ribbon--that supports both fast, transient and slow, sustained modes of transmission. We find that the synaptic ribbon serves a dual function as a conduit for diffusion of synaptic vesicles and a platform for vesicles to fuse distal to the plasma membrane itself, via compound fusion. The combination of these functions allows the ribbon-type CAZ to achieve the continuous transmitter release required by synapses of neurons that carry tonic, graded visual signals in the retina.",

Z-linked scaffolds in the D. plexippus genome assembly were identified via sex-specific differences in Illumina sequencing coverage. Additionally, a majority of the D. plexippus genome assembly was assigned to chromosomes based on counts of 1-to-1 orthologs relative to the butterfly Melitaea cinxia (with replication using two other lepidopteran species), in which genome scaffolds have been mapped to linkage groups. Sequencing-coverage based assessments of Z-linkage combined with homology based chromosomal assignments provided strong evidence for a Z-autosome fusion in the Danaus lineage, involving the autosome homologous to chromosome 21 in M. cinxia. Coverage analysis also identified three notable assembly errors resulting in chimeric Z-autosome scaffolds. Cytogenetic analysis further revealed a large W-chromosome that is partially euchromatic, consistent with being a neo-W chromosome. The discovery of a neo-Z and the provisional assignment of chromosome linkage for >90% of D. plexippus genes lays the foundation for novel insights concerning sex chromosome evolution in this female-heterogametic model species for functional and evolutionary genomics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons (MNs) to cause progressive paralysis. Ninety percent of cases are sporadic (sALS) and ten percent are familial (fALS). The molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration remain elusive and there is a lack of promising biomarkers that define ALS phenotypes and progression. To date, most expression studies have focused on either complex whole tissues that contain cells other than MNs or induced pluripotent derived MNs (iMNs). Furthermore, as human tissue samples have high variability, estimation of differential gene-expression is not a trivial task.\\n\\nResultsHere, we report a battery of orthogonal computational analyses to discover geneexpression defects in laser capture microdissected and enriched MN RNA pools from sALS patient spinal cords in regions destined for but not yet advanced in neurodegenerative stage. We used total RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), applied multiple percentile rank (MPR) analysis to analyze MN-specific gene-expression signatures, and used high-throughput qPCR to validate RNA-seq results. Furthermore, we used a systems-level approach that identified molecular networks perturbed in sALS MNs. Weighted gene co-expression correlation network (WGCNA) analysis revealed defects in neurotransmitter biosynthesis and RNA-processing pathways while gene-gene interaction analysis showed abnormalities in networks that pertained to cell-adhesion, immune response and wound healing.\\n\\nConclusionsWe discover gene-expression signatures that distinguish sALS from control MNs and our findings illuminate possible mechanisms of cellular toxicity. Our systematic and comprehensive analysis serves as a framework to reveal expression signatures and disrupted pathways that will be useful for future mechanistic studies and biomarker based therapeutic research.",

Offspring of longer lived parents had more protective alleles (lower genetic risk scores) for coronary artery disease, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, type-1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and Alzheimers disease. In candidate gene analyses, variants in the TOMM40/APOE locus were associated with longevity (including rs429358, p=3x10-5), but FOXO variants were not associated.\\n\\nThese results support a multiple protective factors model for achieving longer lifespans in humans, with a prominent role for cardiovascular-related pathways.

Yet, a remarkable degree of natural variation in physiological and transcriptional auxin responses has been described among Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. As intra-species comparisons offer only limited genetic variation, we here inspect the variation of auxin responses between A. thaliana and A. lyrata. This approach allowed the identification of conserved auxin response genes including novel genes with potential relevance for auxin biology. Furthermore, promoter divergences were analyzed for putative sources of variation. De novo motif discovery identified novel and variants of known elements with potential relevance for auxin responses, emphasizing the complex, and yet elusive, code of element combinations accounting for the diversity in transcriptional auxin responses. Furthermore, network analysis revealed correlations of inter-species differences in the expression of AUX/IAA gene clusters and classic auxin-related genes. We conclude that variation in general transcriptional and physiological auxin responses may originate substantially from functional or transcriptional variations in the TIR1/AFB, AUX/IAA, and ARF signaling network. In that respect, AUX/IAA gene expression divergence potentially reflects differences in the manner in which different species transduce identical auxin signals into gene expression responses.",

Our analysis presents a framework for interpreting haplotype diversity within and between population groups and provides a demographic foundation for genetic epidemiology in Africa. We show that coastal African populations have experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes as a series of admixture events over the last 7,000 years, and that Niger-Congo speaking groups from East and Southern Africa share ancestry with Central West Africans as a result of recent population expansions associated with the adoption of new agricultural technologies. We demonstrate that most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups from outside of their current geographic region as a result of large-scale population movements over the last 4,000 years. Our in-depth analysis of admixture provides an insight into haplotype sharing across different geographic groups and the recent movement of alleles into new climatic and pathogenic environments, both of which will aid the interpretation of genetic studies of disease in sub-Saharan Africa.",

    "abstract": "Resequencing efforts are uncovering the extent of genetic variation in humans and provide data to study the evolutionary processes shaping our genome. One recurring puzzle in both intra- and inter-species studies is the high frequency of complex mutations comprising multiple nearby base substitutions or insertion-deletions. We devised a generalized mutation model of template switching during replication that extends existing models of genome rearrangement, and used this to study the role of template switch events in the origin of such mutation clusters. Applied to the human genome, our model detects thousands of template switch events during the evolution of human and chimp from their common ancestor, and hundreds of events between two independently sequenced human genomes. While many of these are consistent with the template switch mechanism previously proposed for bacteria but not thought significant in higher organisms, our model also identifies new types of mutations that create short inversions, some flanked by paired inverted repeats. The local template switch process can create numerous complex mutation patterns, including hairpin loop structures, and explains multi-nucleotide mutations and compensatory substitutions without invoking positive selection, complicated and speculative mechanisms, or implausible coincidence. Clustered sequence differences are challenging for mapping and variant calling methods, and we show that detection of mutation clusters with current resequencing methodologies is difficult and many erroneous variant annotations exist in human reference data. Template switch events such as those we have uncovered may have been neglected as an explanation for complex mutations because of biases in commonly used analyses. Incorporation of our model into reference-based analysis pipelines and comparisons of de novo-assembled genomes will lead to improved understanding of genome variation and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Although cell cycle control is an ancient, conserved, and essential process, some core animal and fungal cell cycle regulators share no more sequence identity than non-homologous proteins. Here, we show that evolution along the fungal lineage was punctuated by the early acquisition and entrainment of the SBF transcription factor through horizontal gene transfer. Cell cycle evolution in the fungal ancestor then proceeded through a hybrid network containing both SBF and its ancestral animal counterpart E2F, which is still maintained in many basal fungi. We hypothesize that a virally-derived SBF may have initially hijacked cell cycle control by activating transcription via the cis-regulatory elements targeted by the ancestral cell cycle regulator E2F, much like extant viral oncogenes. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that SBF can regulate promoters with E2F binding sites in budding yeast.",

    "abstract": "Clinical influenza A isolates are frequently not sequenced directly. Instead, a majority of these isolates (~70% in 2015) are first subjected to passaging for amplification, most commonly in non-human cell culture. Here, we find that this passaging leaves distinct signals of adaptation in the viral sequences, which can confound evolutionary analyses of the viral sequences. We find distinct patterns of adaptation to Madin-Darby (MDCK) and monkey cell culture absent from unpassaged hemagglutinin sequences. These patterns also dominate pooled datasets not separated by passaging type, and they increase in proportion to the number of passages performed. By contrast, MDCK-SIAT1 passaged sequences seem mostly (but not entirely) free of passaging adaptations. Contrary to previous studies, we find that using only internal branches of the influenza phylogenetic trees is insufficient to correct for passaging artifacts. These artifacts can only be safely avoided by excluding passaged sequences entirely from subsequent analysis. We conclude that future influenza evolutionary analyses should appropriately control for potentially confounding effects of passaging adaptations.",

    "abstract": "A model which treats the denatured and the native conformers as being confined to harmonic Gibbs energy wells has been used to analyse the non-Arrhenius behaviour of spontaneously-folding fixed two-state systems. The results demonstrate that when pressure and solvent are constant: (i) a two-state system is physically defined only for a finite temperature range; (ii) irrespective of the primary sequence, the 3-dimensional structure of the native conformer, the residual structure in the denatured state, and the magnitude of the folding and unfolding rate constants, the equilibrium stability of a two-state system is a maximum when its denatured conformers bury the least amount of solvent accessible surface area (SASA) to reach the activated state; (iii) the Gibbs barriers to folding and unfolding are not always due to the incomplete compensation of the activation enthalpies and entropies; (iv) the difference in heat capacity between the reaction-states is due to both the size of the solvent-shell and the non-covalent interactions; (v) the position of the transition state ensemble along the reaction coordinate (RC) depends on the choice of the RC; and (vi) the atomic structure of the transiently populated reaction-states cannot be inferred from perturbation-induced changes in their energetics.",

    "abstract": "We present an open-source software platform that transforms the emotions expressed by speech signals using audio effects like pitch shifting, inflection, vibrato, and filtering. The emotional transformations can be applied to any audio file, but can also run in real-time (with less than 20-millisecond latency), using live input from a microphone. We anticipate that this tool will be useful for the study of emotions in psychology and neuroscience, because it enables a high level of control over the acoustical and emotional content of experimental stimuli in a variety of laboratory situations, including real-time social situations. We present here results of a series of validation experiments showing that transformed emotions are recognized at above-chance levels in the French, English, Swedish and Japanese languages, with a naturalness comparable to natural speech. Then, we provide a list of twenty-five experimental ideas applying this new tool to important topics in the behavioral sciences.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of coupled variables is a core concept of cell biological inference, with co-localization of two molecules as a proxy for protein interaction being a ubiquitous example. However, external effectors may influence the observed co-localization independently from the local interaction of two proteins. Such global bias, although biologically meaningful, is often neglected when interpreting co-localization. Here, we describe DeBias, a computational method to quantify and decouple global bias from local interactions between variables by modeling the observed co-localization as the cumulative contribution of a global and a local component. We showcase four applications of DeBias in different areas of cell biology, and demonstrate that the global bias encapsulates fundamental mechanistic information of cellular behavior. The DeBias software package is freely accessible online via a web-server at https://debias.biohpc.swmed.edu.",

    "abstract": "The comparison between perceived and unperceived trials at perceptual threshold isolates not only the core neuronal substrate of a particular conscious perception, but also aspects of brain activity that facilitate, hinder or tend to follow conscious perception. We take a step towards the resolution of these confounds by combining an analysis of ECoG neuronal responses observed during the presentation of faces partially masked by Continuous Flash Suppression, and those responses observed during the unmasked presentation of faces and other images in the same subjects. Neuronal activity in both the fusiform gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus discriminated seen vs. unseen faces in the masked paradigm and upright faces vs. other categories in the unmasked paradigm. However, only the former discriminated upright vs. inverted faces in the unmasked paradigm. Our results suggest a prominent role for the fusiform gyrus in the configural perception of faces.",
