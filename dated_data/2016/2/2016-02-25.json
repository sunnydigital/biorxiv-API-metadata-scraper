    "abstract": "The detection of genomic regions involved in local adaptation is an important topic in current population genetics. There are several detection strategies available depending on the kind of genetic and demographic information at hand. A common drawback is the high risk of false positives. In this study, we introduce two complementary methods for the detection of divergent selection from populations connected by migration. Both methods have been developed with the aim of being robust to false positives. The first method combines haplotype information with inter-population differentiation (FST). Evidence of divergent selection is concluded only when both the haplotype pattern and the FST value support it. The second method is developed for independently segregating markers i.e. there is no haplotype information at hand. In this case, the power to detect selection is attained by developing a new outlier test based on detecting a bimodal distribution. The test computes the FST outliers and then assumes that those of interest would have a different mode which is detected by a clustering algorithm. The utility of the two methods is demonstrated through simulations and the analysis of real data. The simulation results show power ranging from 60-94% in several of the scenarios whilst the false positive rate is controlled below the nominal level in every scenario. The analysis of real samples consisted of phased data from the HapMap project and unphased data from intertidal marine snail ecotypes. The software HacDivSel implements the methods explained in this manuscript.",

    "abstract": "Computational methods for Target Fishing (TF), also known as Target Prediction or Polypharmacology Prediction, can be used to discover new targets in small-molecule drugs. This may result in repositioning the drug in a new indication or improving our current understanding of its efficacy and side effects. While there is a substantial body of research on TF methods, there is still a need to improve their validation, which is often limited to a small part of the available targets and not easily interpretable by the user. Here we discuss how target-centric TF methods are inherently limited by the number of targets that can possibly predict (this number is by construction much larger in ligand-centric techniques). We also propose a new benchmark to validate TF methods, which is particularly suited to analyse how predictive performance varies with the query molecule. On average over approved drugs, we estimate that only five predicted targets will have to be tested to find two true targets with submicromolar potency (a strong variability in performance is however observed). In addition, we find that an approved drug has currently an average of eight known targets, which reinforces the notion that polypharmacology is a common and strong event. Furthermore, with the assistance of a control group of randomly-selected molecules, we show that the targets of approved drugs are generally harder to predict.",

    "abstract": "Kinases play a critical role in many cellular signaling pathways and are dysregulated in a number of diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. Since the FDA approval of imatinib in 2001, therapeutics targeting kinases now account for roughly 50% of current cancer drug discovery efforts. The ability to explore human kinase biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology in the laboratory is essential to making rapid progress in understanding kinase regulation, designing selective inhibitors, and studying the emergence of drug resistance. While insect and mammalian expression systems are frequently used for the expression of human kinases, bacterial expression systems are superior in terms of simplicity and cost-effectiveness but have historically struggled with human kinase expression. Following the discovery that phosphatase coexpression could produce high yields of Src and Abl kinase domains in bacterial expression systems, we have generated a library of 52 His-tagged human kinase domain constructs that express above 2 {micro}g/mL culture in a simple automated bacterial expression system utilizing phosphatase coexpression (YopH for Tyr kinases, Lambda for Ser/Thr kinases). Here, we report a structural bioinformatics approach to identify kinase domain constructs previously expressed in bacteria likely to express well in a simple high-throughput protocol, experiments demonstrating our simple construct selection strategy selects constructs with good expression yields in a test of 84 potential kinase domain boundaries for Abl, and yields from a high-throughput expression screen of 96 human kinase constructs. Using a fluorescence-based thermostability assay and a fluorescent ATP-competitive inhibitor, we show that the highest-expressing kinases are folded and have well-formed ATP binding sites. We also demonstrate how the resulting expressing constructs can be used for the biophysical and biochemical study of clinical mutations by engineering a panel of 48 Src mutations and 46 Abl mutations via single-primer mutagenesis and screening the resulting library for expression yields. The wild-type kinase construct library is available publicly via Addgene, and should prove to be of high utility for experiments focused on drug discovery and the emergence of drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation of bacteria occurs predominantly via horizontal gene transfer. While it is widely recognized that horizontal gene acquisitions frequently encompass multiple genes, it is currently unclear what the size distribution of successfully transferred DNA segments looks like and what evolutionary forces shape this distribution. Here, we identified 7,538 gene pairs that were consistently co-gained on the same branches across a phylogeny of 53 E. coli strains. These pairs are significantly enriched in genes that share the same GO annotation. We estimated the genomic distances of these co-gained pairs at the time they were transferred to their host genomes, which shows a sharp upper bound at 30kb. This upper bound is significantly lower than the size limit on gene co-transfers imposed by the carrying capacity of the transfer agents. The observed distance distribution also appears inconsistent with a model based on the co-transfer of genes within operons; instead, we found that the distance distribution of co-transferred genes closely matches the distribution expected from the transfer of uber-operons, i.e., genomic clusters of co-functioning genes beyond operons.",

I sampled sand crabs, Lepidopa benedicti were sampled at South Padre Island, Texas, regularly for more than five years. Density is high in the summer, and low in the winter. The sex ratio is slightly, but consistently, female skewed. Ovigerous females, carrying about one thousand eggs, are found in mid-summer, with most of the young of the year settling in autumn. The average size of individuals in the South Texas population is smaller than individuals in the Atlantic Ocean, but the population density appear to be higher in Texas. I also describe a new orange colour morph. The results are not consistent with an earlier suggestion that South Texas acts as a population sink for L. benedicti.",

    "abstract": "Several diseases related to cell proliferation are characterized by the accumulation of somatic DNA changes, with respect to wildtype conditions. Cancer and HIV are two common examples of such diseases, where the mutational load in the cancerous/viral population increases over time. In these cases, selective pres sures are often observed along with competition, co-operation and parasitism among distinct cellular clones. Recently, we presented a mathematical framework to model these phenomena, based on a combination of Bayesian inference and Suppes theory of probabilistic causation, depicted in graphical structures dubbed Suppes-Bayes Causal Networks (SBCNs). SBCNs are generative probabilistic graphical models that recapitulate the potential ordering of accumulation of such DNA changes during the progression of the disease. Such models can be inferred from data by exploiting likelihood-based model-selection strategies with regularization. In this paper we discuss the theoretical foun dations of our approach and we investigate in depth the influence on the model-selection task of: (i) the poset based on Suppes theory and (ii) different regulariza tion strategies. Furthermore, we provide an example of application of our framework to HIV genetic data highlighting the valuable insights provided by the inferred SBCN.",

    "abstract": "Despite many successes of genome-wide association (GWA) studies, known susceptibility variants identified by GWAS have the modest effect sizes and we met noticeable skepticism about the risk prediction model building with large-scale genetic data. However, in contrast with genetic variants, family history of diseases has been largely accepted as an important risk factor in clinical diagnosis and risk prediction though; complicated structures of family history of diseases have limited their application to clinical use. Here, we develop a new method which enables the incorporation of general family history of diseases with the liability threshold model and a new analysis strategy for risk prediction with penalized regression incorporating large-scale genetic variants and clinical risk factors. An application of our model to type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients in Korean population (1846 cases out of 3692 subjects) demonstrates that SNPs accounts for 28.6% of T2Ds variability and incorporation of family history leads to additional improvement of 5.9%. Our result illustrates that family history of diseases can have an invaluable information for disease prediction and may bridge the gap originated from missing heritability.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance is a major issue in the Shigellae, particularly as a specific multidrug resistant (MDR) lineage of Shigella sonnei (lineage III) is becoming globally dominant. Ciprofloxacin is a recommended treatment for Shigella infections. However, ciprofloxacin resistant S. sonnei are being increasingly isolated in Asia, and sporadically reported on other continents.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsHypothesising that Asia is the hub for the recent international spread of ciprofloxacin resistant S. sonnei, we performed whole genome sequencing on a collection of contemporaneous ciprofloxacin resistant S. sonnei isolated in six countries from within and outside of Asia. We reconstructed the recent evolutionary history of these organisms and combined these data with their geographical location of isolation. Placing these sequences into a global phylogeny we found that all ciprofloxacin resistant S. sonnei formed a single clade within a Central Asian expansion of Lineage III. Further, our data show that resistance to ciprofloxacin within S. sonnei can be globally attributed to a single clonal emergence event, encompassing sequential gyrA-S83L, parC-S80I and gyrA-D87G mutations. Geographical data predict that South Asia is the likely primary source of these organisms, which are being regularly exported across Asia and intercontinentally into Australia, the USA and Europe.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study shows that a single clone, which is widespread in South Asia, is driving the current intercontinental surge of ciprofloxacin resistant S. sonnei and is capable of establishing endemic transmission in new locations. Despite being limited in geographical scope, our work has major implications for understanding the international transfer of antimicrobial resistant S. sonnei, and provides a tractable model for studying how antimicrobial resistant Gram-negative community acquired pathogens spread globally.",

    "abstract": "Histone H1 variants, known as linker histones, are essential chromatin components in higher eukaryotes, yet compared to the core histones relatively little is known about their in vivo functions. The filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa encodes a single H1 protein that is not essential for viability. To investigate the role of N. crassa H1, we constructed a functional FLAG-tagged H1 fusion protein and performed genomic and molecular analyses. Cell fractionation experiments showed that H1-FLAG is a chromatin binding protein. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation combined with sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that H1-3XFLAG is globally enriched throughout the genome with a subtle preference for promoters of expressed genes. In mammals, the stochiometery of H1 impacts nucleosome repeat length. To determine if H1 impacts nucleosome occupancy or nucleosome positioning in N. crassa, we performed Micrococcal nuclease digestion in wildtype and the {Delta}hH1 strain followed by sequencing (MNase-seq). Deletion of hH1 did not significantly impact nucleosome positioning or nucleosome occupancy. Analysis of DNA methylation by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (MethylC-seq) revealed a modest but global increase in DNA methylation in the {Delta}hH1 mutant. Together, these data suggest that H1 acts as a non-specific chromatin binding protein that can limit accessibility of the DNA methylation machinery in N. crassa.",

Missing has been any structural understanding of these interactions, with no full-length structures of human Hsp90, Cdc37 or either of these proteins with a kinase. Here we report a 3.9[A] cryoEM structure of the Hsp90:Cdc37:Cdk4 kinase complex. Cdk4 is in a novel conformation, with its two lobes completely separated. Cdc37 mimics part of the kinase N-lobe, stabilizing an open kinase conformation by wedging itself between the two lobes. Finally, Hsp90 clamps around the unfolded kinase {beta}5 strand and interacts with exposed N-and C-lobe interfaces, safely trapping the kinase in an unfolded state. Based on this novel structure and extensive previous data, we propose unifying conceptual and mechanistic models of chaperone-kinase interactions.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe first structure of a chaperone:kinase complex reveals that the Hsp90 system modulates and stabilizes kinases via a functionally relevant, unfolded open state.",
