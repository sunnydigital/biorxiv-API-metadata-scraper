    "abstract": "In 2013, U.S. swine producers were confronted with the disruptive emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED). Movement of animals among farms is hypothesised to have played a role in the spread of PED among farms. Via this or other mechanisms, the rate of spread may also depend on the geographic density of farms and climate. To evaluate such effects on a large scale, we analyse state-level counts of outbreaks with variables describing the distribution of farm sizes and types, aggregate flows of animals among farms, and an index of climate. Our first main finding is that it is possible for a correlation analysis to be sensitive to transmission model parameters. This finding is based on a global sensitivity analysis of correlations on simulated data that included a biased and noisy observation model based on the available PED data. Our second main finding is that flows are significantly associated with the reports of PED outbreaks. This finding is based on correlations of pairwise relationships and regression modeling of total and weekly outbreak counts. These findings illustrate how variation in population structure may be employed along with observational data to improve understanding of disease spread.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing is regulated by multiple RNA-binding proteins and influences the expression of most eukaryotic genes. However, the role of this process in human disease, and particularly in cancer, is only starting to be unveiled. We systematically analyzed mutation, copy number and gene expression patterns of 1348 RNA-binding protein (RBP) genes in 11 solid tumor types, together with alternative splicing changes in these tumors and the enrichment of binding motifs in the alternatively spliced sequences. Our comprehensive study reveals widespread alterations in the expression of RBP genes, as well as novel mutations and copy number variations in association with multiple alternative splicing changes in cancer drivers and oncogenic pathways. Remarkably, the altered splicing patterns in several tumor types recapitulate those of undifferentiated cells. These patterns are predicted to be mainly controlled by MBNL1 and involve multiple cancer drivers, including the mitotic gene NUMA1. We show that NUMA1 alternative splicing induces enhanced cell proliferation and centrosome amplification in non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. Our study uncovers novel splicing networks that potentially contribute to cancer development and progression.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins fail to adopt a stable three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions. It is now understood that many disordered proteins are not dysfunctional, but instead engage in numerous cellular processes, including signaling and regulation. Disorder characterization from amino acid sequence relies on computational disorder prediction algorithms. While numerous large-scale investigations of disorder have been performed using these algorithms, and have offered valuable insight regarding the prevalence of protein disorder in many organisms, critical proteome-based descriptive statistical guidelines that would enable the objective assessment of intrinsic disorder in a protein of interest remain to be established. Here we present a quantitative characterization of numerous disorder features using a rigorous non-parametric statistical approach, providing expected values and percentile cutoffs for each feature in ten eukaryotic proteomes. Our estimates utilize multiple ab initio disorder prediction algorithms grounded on physicochemical principles. Furthermore, we present novel threshold values, specific to both the prediction algorithms and the proteomes, defining the longest primary sequence length in which the significance of a continuous disordered region can be evaluated on the basis of length alone. The guidelines presented here are intended to improve the interpretation of disorder content and continuous disorder predictions from the proteomic point of view.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale biological networks map functional connections between most genes in the genome and can potentially uncover high level organizing principles governing cellular functions. These networks, however, are famously complex and often regarded as disordered masses of tangled interactions (\\\"hairballs\\\") that are nearly impenetrable to biologists. As a result, our current understanding of network functional organization is very limited. To address this problem, I developed a systematic quantitative approach for annotating biological networks and examining their functional structure. This method, named Spatial Analysis of Functional Enrichment (SAFE), detects network regions that are statistically overrepresented for a functional group or a quantitative phenotype of interest, and provides an intuitive visual representation of their relative positioning within the network. By successfully annotating the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetic interaction network with Gene Ontology terms, SAFE proved to be sensitive to functional signals and robust to noise. In addition, SAFE annotated the network with chemical genomic data and uncovered a new potential mechanism of resistance to the anti-cancer drug bortezomib. Finally, SAFE showed that protein-protein interactions, despite their apparent complexity, also have a high level functional structure. These results demonstrate that SAFE is a powerful new tool for examining biological networks and advancing our understanding of the functional organization of the cell.",

    "abstract": "Between October 2013 and April 2014, more than 30,000 cases of Zika virus (ZIKV) disease were estimated to have attended healthcare facilities in French Polynesia. ZIKV has also been reported in Africa and Asia, and in 2015 the virus spread to South America and the Caribbean. Infection with ZIKV has been associated with neurological complications including Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly, which led the World Health Organization to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2015. To better understand the transmission dynamics of ZIKV, we used a mathematical model to examine the 2013-14 outbreak on the six major archipelagos of French Polynesia. Our median estimates for the basic reproduction number ranged from 2.6-4.8, with an estimated 11.5% (95% CI: 7.32-17.9%) of total infections reported. As a result, we estimated that 94% (95% CI: 91-97%) of the total population of the six archipelagos were infected during the outbreak. Based on the demography of French Polynesia, our results imply that if ZIKV infection provides complete protection against future infection, it would take 12-20 years before there are a sufficient number of susceptible individuals for ZIKV to reemerge, which is on the same timescale as the circulation of dengue virus serotypes in the region. Our analysis suggests that ZIKV may exhibit similar dynamics to dengue virus in island populations, with transmission characterized by large, sporadic outbreaks with a high proportion of asymptomatic or unreported cases.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySince the first reported major outbreak of Zika virus disease in Micronesia in 2007, the virus has caused outbreaks throughout the Pacific and South America. Transmitted by the Aedes species of mosquitoes, the virus has been linked to possible neurological complications including Guillain-Barre Syndrome and microcephaly. To improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of Zika virus in island populations, we analysed the 2013-14 outbreak on the six major archipelagos of French Polynesia. We found evidence that Zika virus infected the majority of population, but only around 12% of total infections on the archipelagos were reported as cases. If infection with Zika virus generates lifelong immunity, we estimate that it would take at least 15-20 years before there are enough susceptible people for the virus to reemerge. Our results suggest that Zika virus could exhibit similar dynamics to dengue virus in the Pacific, producing large but sporadic outbreaks in small island populations.",

    "abstract": "Multiple methods have been introduced over the past 30 years to identify the genomic insertion sites of transposable elements and other DNA elements that integrate into genomes. However, each of these methods suffer from limitations that can frustrate attempts to map multiple insertions in a single genome and to map insertions in genomes of high complexity that contain extensive repetitive DNA. I introduce a new method for transposon mapping that is simple to perform, can accurately map multiple insertions per genome, and generates long sequence \\\"reads\\\" that facilitate mapping to complex genomes. The method, called TagMap, for Tagmentation-based Mapping, relies on a modified Tn5 tagmentation protocol with a single tagmentation adaptor followed by PCR using primers specific to the tranposable element and the adaptor sequence. Several minor modifications to normal tagmentation reagents and protocols allow easy and rapid preparation of TagMap libraries. Short read sequencing starting from the adaptor sequence generates oriented reads that flank and are oriented toward the transposable element insertion site. The convergent orientation of adjacent reads at the insertion site allows straightforward prediction of the precise insertion site(s). A Linux shell script is provided to identify insertion sites from fastq files.",

    "abstract": "How honest signals evolve is a question that has been hotly debated by animal communication theoreticians and for which empirical evidence has been difficult to obtain. Theory predicts that, due to strong conflicts of interest, communication in aggressive contexts should be under strong selection for clear and reliable signaling. On the other hand, context-dependent signaling increases cheating opportunities, depending on how senders and receivers use, acquire and process signal information. Using animal signaling theory, theoretical visual models and behavioral experimentation, we characterize and determine proximate honesty mechanisms of the facial coloration in the Princess of Burundi cichlid, Neolamprologus brichardi, a species with complex social interactions. We show that this facial color pattern evolved stable chromatic conspicuousness for efficient transmission in the aquatic environment, while context-dependent plasticity in luminance of the horizontal black stripe element is used to signal switches in aggressive intent. Importantly, using experimental signal manipulation we demonstrate that social selection by receiver retaliation is the mechanism responsible for maintaining signal honesty. We suggest that by affecting the evolution of pigmentation patterns in sexually monochromatic cichlid species, social selection can have potential impacts on diversification dynamics.",

Here, we identified 23,095 TE presence/absence variants between 216 Arabidopsis accessions. Most TE variants were rare, and we find a burden of rare variants associated with local extremes of gene expression and DNA methylation levels within the population. Of the common alleles identified, two thirds were not in linkage disequilibrium with nearby SNPs, implicating these variants as a source of novel genetic diversity. Nearly 200 common TE variants were associated with significantly altered expression of nearby genes, and a major fraction of inter-accession DNA methylation differences were associated with nearby TE insertions. Overall, this demonstrates that TE variants are a rich source of genetic diversity that likely plays an important role in facilitating epigenomic and transcriptional differences between individuals, and indicates a strong genetic basis for epigenetic variation.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a fundamental mechanism that enables organisms such as bacteria to directly transfer genetic material between distant species. This way, bacteria can acquire new traits such as antibiotic resistance or pathogenic toxins. Current bioinfor-matics approaches focus on the detection of past HGT events by exploring phylogenetic trees or genome composition inconsistencies. However, this normally requires the availability of finished and fully annotated genomes and of sufficiently large deviations that allow detection. Thus, these techniques are not widely applicable. Especially in an outbreak scenario where new HGT mediated pathogens emerge, there is need for fast and precise HGT detection. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies can facilitate swift analysis of unknown pathogens but, to the best of our knowledge, so far no approach uses NGS data directly to detect HGTs.\\n\\nWe present Daisy, a novel mapping-based tool for HGT detection directly from NGS data. Daisy determines HGT boundaries with split-read mapping and evaluates candidate regions relying on read pair and coverage information. Daisy can successfully detect HGT regions with base pair resolution in both simulated and real data, and outperforms alternative approaches using a genome assembly of the reads. We see our approach as a powerful complement for a comprehensive analysis of HGT in the context of NGS data. Daisy is freely available from http://github.com/ktrappe/daisy.",

    "abstract": "Four insertional or quasiterminal translocations (T) were recently introgressed from Neurospora crassa into N. tetrasperma. Crosses of two of the resulting TNt strains with N. tetrasperma N strains (N = normal sequence) produced more Dp than T and N homokaryotic progeny, although [T + N] and [Dp + Df] heterokaryotic progeny were made in roughly equal numbers. The T, N, and [T + N] progeny are derived from alternate segregation (ALT), whereas adjacent-1 segregation (ADJ) generates the Dp, Df, and [Dp + Df] types. Differential recovery of homokaryotic products from ALT and ADJ represents a novel and unprecedented type of meiotic drive. This drive contributed to our inability to introgress a larger insertions translocation, T(VR>VIL)UK3-41, into N. tetrasperma. We suggest that one or more Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller type incompatibility between N. crassa and N. tetrasperma genes in the TNt x N crosses might cause an insufficiency for a product required for ascospore maturation. Since the Df type is inviable, only four ascospores (Dp or [Dp + Df] types) share this limited resource in [Dp + Df] asci, whereas four to eight ascospores compete for it in [T + N] asci. This increases the chance that in asci with >4 ascospores none properly matures, and results in Dp progeny out-numbering T and N types.",

Finding that they did not place their regression-based evidence in a modelling context, we recast their result as an example of the ramp model of density dependence that underlies black rhinoceros meta-population management. Greaver et al. concluded that the Ithala population did not reach carrying capacity, a conclusion we consider unwarranted since they did not conduct any analyses of trends in demographic parameters with population density. Our interpretation implies that the Ithala population did indeed reach carrying capacity. Where relevant, we compared their results for the Ithala population with those for another southern African black-rhinoceros population in order to provide a broader basis for evaluating black rhinoceros demography. We detail inconsistent presentation of data in their paper that plagued our efforts to understand their results and also draw attention to possible errors in some analyses. In particular, we argue that the results on birth rates reported by Greaver et al. appear dubious.
