Previously, the calculation of these values was only possible from a collection of gene trees with exactly the same taxon set as the reference tree. An application to sets of partial gene trees requires mathematical corrections in the internode certainty and tree certainty calculations. We implement our methods in RAxML and test them on empirical data sets. These tests imply that the inclusion of partial trees does matter. However, in order to provide meaningful measurements, any data set should also include trees containing the full species set.",

Our understanding of biology and the prospect for bioengineered plants with higher productivity may both be impacted by a greater understanding of this area. Here we use the ensemble modelling robustness analysis (EMRA) framework to show that the action of the phosphate/G3P antiporter is much more significant for maintenance of stability than a recently proposed G6P shunt. Additionally, we interpret recent results suggesting that overexpression of RuBiSCO does not improve growth rate of plants but overexpression of SBPase does. Our simulations reproduce this result, but only in models which do not include the G6P shunt. Taken together, these results may suggest a situational role for the G6P shunt, possibly in dynamic situations under starvation or other stress conditions.",

However, it has proven difficult to perform this technique on frozen samples because freezing cells before extracting nuclei impairs nuclear integrity and alters chromatin structure. We describe a protocol for freezing cells that is compatible with ATAC-Seq, producing results that compare well with those generated from fresh cells. We found that while flash-frozen samples are not suitable for ATAC-Seq, the assay is successful with slow-cooled cryopreserved samples. Using this method, we were able to isolate high quality, intact nuclei, and we verified that epigenetic results from fresh and cryopreserved samples agree quantitatively. We developed our protocol on a disease-relevant cell type, namely motor neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells from a patient affected by spinal muscular atrophy.",

    "abstract": "Between October 2013 and April 2014, more than 30,000 cases of Zika virus (ZIKV) disease were estimated to have attended healthcare facilities in French Polynesia. ZIKV has also been reported in Africa and Asia, and in 2015 the virus spread to South America and the Caribbean. Infection with ZIKV has been associated with neurological complications including Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly, which led the World Health Organization to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2015. To better understand the transmission dynamics of ZIKV, we used a mathematical model to examine the 2013-14 outbreak on the six major archipelagos of French Polynesia. Our median estimates for the basic reproduction number ranged from 2.6-4.8, with an estimated 11.5% (95% CI: 7.32-17.9%) of total infections reported. As a result, we estimated that 94% (95% CI: 91-97%) of the total population of the six archipelagos were infected during the outbreak. Based on the demography of French Polynesia, our results imply that if ZIKV infection provides complete protection against future infection, it would take 12-20 years before there are a sufficient number of susceptible individuals for ZIKV to reemerge, which is on the same timescale as the circulation of dengue virus serotypes in the region. Our analysis suggests that ZIKV may exhibit similar dynamics to dengue virus in island populations, with transmission characterized by large, sporadic outbreaks with a high proportion of asymptomatic or unreported cases.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySince the first reported major outbreak of Zika virus disease in Micronesia in 2007, the virus has caused outbreaks throughout the Pacific and South America. Transmitted by the Aedes species of mosquitoes, the virus has been linked to possible neurological complications including Guillain-Barre Syndrome and microcephaly. To improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of Zika virus in island populations, we analysed the 2013-14 outbreak on the six major archipelagos of French Polynesia. We found evidence that Zika virus infected the majority of population, but only around 12% of total infections on the archipelagos were reported as cases. If infection with Zika virus generates lifelong immunity, we estimate that it would take at least 15-20 years before there are enough susceptible people for the virus to reemerge. Our results suggest that Zika virus could exhibit similar dynamics to dengue virus in the Pacific, producing large but sporadic outbreaks in small island populations.",

Neuroscientific studies of fluid intelligence have studied both fluid intelligence tasks of varying difficulty and individual differences in fluid intelligence ability, but have failed to appropriately distinguish the two dimensions. Here we use task-based fMRI (N=34) to show that within and between subject dimensions show both partial overlap and widespread differences. Individuals with higher ability showed widespread increased activity including bilateral frontoparietal systems, whereas more difficult items were associated with more focal activity increases in middle frontal gyri, frontal poles and superior frontal poles. Finally, we show that when difficulty is equated across individuals, those with higher ability tend to show more fronto-parietal activity, whereas low fluid intelligence individuals tend to show greater activity in higher visual areas.

    "abstract": "Many approaches for inferring adaptive molecular evolution analyze the unfolded site frequency spectrum (SFS), a vector of counts of sites with different numbers of copies of derived alleles in a sample of alleles from a population. Accurate inference of the high copy number elements of the SFS is difficult, however, because of misassignment of alleles as derived versus ancestral. This is a known problem with parsimony using outgroup species. Here, we show that the problem is particularly serious if there is variation in the substitution rate among sites brought about by variation in selective constraint levels. We present a new method for inferring the SFS using one or two outgroups, which attempts to overcome the problem of misassignment. We show that two outgroups are required for accurate estimation of the SFS if there is substantial variation in selective constraints, which is expected to be the case for nonsynonymous sites of protein-coding genes. We apply the method to estimate unfolded SFSs for synonymous and nonsynonymous sites from Phase 2 of the Drosophila Population Genomics Project. We use the unfolded spectra to estimate the frequency and strength of advantageous and deleterious mutations, and estimate that {small tilde}50% of amino acid substitutions are positively selected, but that less than 0.5% of new amino acid mutations are beneficial, with a scaled selection strength of Nes {approx} 12.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive radiation is thought to be responsible for the evolution of a great portion of the past and present diversity of life. Instances of adaptive radiation, characterized by the rapid emergence of an array of species as a consequence to their adaptation to distinct ecological niches, are important study systems in evolutionary biology. However, because of the rapid lineage formation in these groups, and the occurrence of hybridization between the participating species, it is often difficult to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of species that underwent an adaptive radiation. In this study, we present a novel approach for species-tree estimation in rapidly diversifying lineages, where introgression is known to occur, and apply it to a multimarker dataset containing up to 16 specimens per species for a set of 45 species of East African cichlid fishes (522 individuals in total), with a main focus on the cichlid species flock of Lake Tanganyika. We first identified, using age distributions of most recent common ancestors in individual gene trees, those lineages in our dataset that show strong signatures of past introgression. This led us to formulate three hypotheses of introgression between different lineages of Tanganyika cichlids: the ancestor of Boulengerochromini (or of Boulengerochromini and Bathybatini) received genomic material from the derived H-lineage; the common ancestor of Cyprichromini and Perissodini experienced, in turn, introgression from Boulengerochromini and/or Bathybatini; and the Lake Tanganyika Haplochromini and closely related riverine lineages received genetic material from Cyphotilapiini. We then applied the multispecies coalescent model to estimate the species tree of Lake Tanganyika cichlids, but excluded the lineages involved in these introgression events, as the multispecies coalescent model does not incorporate introgression. This resulted in a robust species tree, in which the Lamprologini were placed as sister lineage to the H-lineage (including the Eretmodini), and we identify a series of rapid splitting events at the base of the H-lineage. Divergence ages estimated with the multispecies coalescent model were substantially younger than age estimates based on concatenation, and agree with the geological history of the Great Lakes of East Africa. Finally, we formally tested the three hypotheses of introgression using a likelihood framework, and find strong support for introgression between some of the cichlid tribes of Lake Tanganyika.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative genetics predicts, that traits subjected to strong selection should show low heritability and may yield biased estimates of genetic correlations (rg). Similar pattern may also appear if genetic sources of variation are confounded with non-genetic sources. Thus, a positive relationship between genetic correlations and heritabilities (h2) of underlying traits might be observed. Here we test this prediction using a large dataset of published estimates of genetic correlations and employing a powerful meta-analytical approach. We considered both between-traits and cross-sex genetic correlations. We failed to find support for the prediction about a positive rg - h2 relationship: our analysis based on nearly 1000 published estimates of genetic parameters indicates that the predicted relationship is weak and statistically non-significant. Thus, low heritability does not preclude the possibility of detecting substantial genetic correlations. Our meta-analysis indicates that published estimates of genetic parameters coming from various experimental designs and obtained using different statistical techniques are not significantly biased in case of weakly-heritable traits.",

We introduce a model-based analysis for temporal patterns of animal call timing, originally developed for networks of firing neurons. This has advantages over cross-correlation analysis in that it can correctly handle common-cause confounds and provides a generative model of call patterns with explicit parameters for the influences between individuals. It also has advantages over standard Markovian analysis in that it incorporates detailed temporal interactions which affect timing as well as sequencing of calls. Further, a fitted model can be used to generate novel synthetic call sequences. We apply the method to calls recorded from groups of domesticated zebra finch (Taenopyggia guttata) individuals. We find that the communication network in these groups has stable structure that persists from one day to the next, and that \\\"kernels\\\" reflecting the temporal range of influence have a characteristic structure for a calling individuals effect on itself, its partner, and on others in the group. We further find characteristic patterns of influences by call type as well as by individual.",

Using data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we show that this allows ADMIXTURE to infer ancestry for 10,920 individuals in a few hours (a 5x speedup). This mode also allows ADMIXTURE to correctly estimate individual ancestry and allele frequencies from a set of related individuals. The second modification allows ADMIXTURE to correctly handle X-chromosome (and other haploid) data from both males and females. We demonstrate increased power to detect sex-biased admixture in African-American individuals from the 1000 Genomes project using this extension.\\n\\nConclusions: These modifications make ADMIXTURE more efficient and versatile, allowing users to extract more information from large genomic datasets.",

How is the information contained in multiple TF binding sites integrated to dictate the rate of transcription? The dominant model is that direct or indirect physical interactions between TFs enable them to combinatorially recruit each other and RNA polymerase to the promoter. Here we develop a quantitative framework to explore an alternative model, where combinatorial gene regulation can result from TFs working on different kinetic steps of the transcription cycle. Our results clarify the null hypotheses for independent action of TFs and show that combinatorial control of the transcription cycle can generate a wide range of analog and Boolean computations without requiring the input regulators to be simultaneously co-localized in the nucleus. This work emphasizes the importance of deciphering TF function beyond activation and repression, highlights the role of the basal promoter in processing regulatory information and suggests qualitative explanations for the flexibility of regulatory evolution.",
