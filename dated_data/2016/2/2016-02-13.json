    "abstract": "O_LIPremise of the study: Hybridization between diploids and tetraploids can lead to new allopolyploid species, often via a triploid intermediate. Viable triploids are often produced asymmetrically, with greater success observed for \\\"maternal-excess\\\" crosses where the mother has a higher ploidy than the father. Here we investigate the evolutionary origins of Mimulus peregrinus, an allohexaploid recently derived from the triploid M. x robertsii, to determine whether reproductive asymmetry has shaped the formation of this new species.\\nC_LIO_LIMethods: We used reciprocal crosses between the diploid (M. guttatus) and tetraploid (M. luteus) progenitors to determine the viability of triploid M. x robertsii hybrids resulting from paternal-versus maternal-excess crosses. To investigate whether experimental results predict patterns seen in the field, we performed parentage analyses comparing natural populations of M. peregrinus to its diploid, tetraploid, and triploid progenitors. Organellar sequences obtained from pre-existing genomic data, supplemented with additional genotyping was used to establish the maternal ancestry of multiple M. peregrinus and M. x robertsii populations.\\nC_LIO_LIKey results: We find strong evidence for asymmetric origins of M. peregrinus, but opposite to the common pattern, with paternal-excess crosses significantly more successful than maternal-excess crosses. These results successfully predicted hybrid formation in nature: 111 of 114 M. x robertsii individuals, and 27 of 27 M. peregrinus, had an M. guttatus maternal haplotype.\\nC_LIO_LIConclusion: This study, which includes the first Mimulus chloroplast genome assembly, demonstrates the utility of parentage analysis through genome skimming. We highlight the benefits of complementing genomic analyses with experimental approaches to understand asymmetry in allopolyploid speciation.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Current medical records are rigid with regards to emerging big biomedical data. Examples of poorly integrated big data that already exist in clinical practice include whole genome sequencing and wearable sensors for real time monitoring. Genome sequencing enables conventional diagnostic interrogation and forms the fundamental baseline for precision health throughout a patients lifetime. Mobile sensors enable tailored monitoring regimes for both reducing risk through precision health interventions and acute condition surveillance. In order to address the absence of these data in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR), we worked with the SAP Personalized Medicine team to re-envision a modern medical record with these components. The pilot project used 37 patient families with complex medical records, whole genome sequencing and some level of wearable monitoring. Core functionality included patient timelines with integrated text analytics, personalized genomic curation and wearable alerts. The current phase is being rolled out to over 1500 patients in clinics across the hospital system. While fundamentally research, we believe this proof of principle platform is the first of its kind and represents the future of data driven clinical medicine.",
