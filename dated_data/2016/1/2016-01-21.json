    "abstract": "Physical forces arising in the extra-cellular environment have a profound impact on cell fate and gene regulation; however the underlying biophysical mechanisms that control this sensitivity remain elusive. It is hypothesized that gene expression may be influenced by the physical deformation of the nucleus in response to force. Here, using 3T3s as a model, we demonstrate that extra-cellular forces cause cell nuclei to rapidly deform (< 1 s) preferentially along their shorter nuclear axis, in an anisotropic manner. Nuclear anisotropy is shown to be regulated by the cytoskeleton within intact cells, with actin and microtubules resistant to orthonormal strains. Importantly, nuclear anisotropy is intrinsic, and observed in isolated nuclei. The sensitivity of this behaviour is influenced by chromatin organization and lamin-A expression. An anisotropic response to force was also highly conserved amongst an array of examined nuclei from differentiated and undifferentiated cell types. Although the functional purpose of this conserved material property remains elusive, it may provide a mechanism through which mechanical cues in the microenvironment are rapidly transmitted to the genome.",

    "abstract": "Despite the global economic and ecological importance of forest trees, the genomic basis of differential adaptation and speciation in tree species is still poorly understood. Populus tremula and P. tremuloides are two of the most widespread tree species in the Northern Hemisphere. Using whole-genome re-sequencing data of 24 P. tremula and 22 P. tremuloides individuals, we find that the two species diverged [~]2.2-3.1 million years ago, coinciding with the severing of the Bering land bridge and the onset of dramatic climatic oscillations during the Pleistocene. Both species have experienced substantial population expansions following long-term declines after species divergence. We detect widespread and heterogeneous genomic differentiation between species, and in accordance with the expectation of allopatric speciation, coalescent simulations suggest that neutral evolutionary processes can account for most of the observed patterns of genomic differentiation. However, there is an excess of regions exhibiting extreme differentiation relative to those expected under demographic simulations, which is indicative of the action of natural selection. Overall genetic differentiation is negatively associated with recombination rate in both species, providing strong support for a role of linked selection in generating the heterogeneous genomic landscape of differentiation between species. Finally, we identify a number of candidate regions and genes that may have been subject to positive and/or balancing selection during the speciation process.",

    "abstract": "Much of the morphological diversity in nature-including among sexes within a species-is a direct consequence of variation in size and shape. However, disentangling variation in sexual dimorphism for both shape (SShD), size (SSD) and their relationship with one another remains complex. Understanding how genetic variation influences both size and shape together, and how this in turn influences SSD and SShD is challenging. In this study we utilize Drosophila wing size and shape as a model system to investigate how mutations influence size and shape as modulated by sex. Previous work has demonstrated that mutations in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Transforming Growth Factor - {beta} (TGF-{beta}) signaling components can influence both wing size and shape. In this study we re-analyze this data to specifically address how they impact the relationship between size and shape in a sex-specific manner, in turn altering the pattern of sexual dimorphism. While most mutations influence shape overall, only a subset have a genotypic specific effect that influences SShD. Furthermore, while we observe sex-specific patterns of allometric shape variation, the effects of most mutations on allometry tend to be small. We discuss this within the context of using mutational analysis to understand sexual size and shape dimorphism.",

    "abstract": "Robustness of a systems behavior to changes in parameter values is a remarkable property of natural systems and especially desirable when designing de novo synthetic gene circuits. Loads on transcription factors resulting from binding to target promoters have been shown to significantly affect the effective time constants of gene transcription networks and to thus alter the overall systems behavior. Here, we employ models that explicitly account for load effects to investigate how these impact the robustness of a stable gene transcription network to parameter perturbations. By employing a combination of sampling-based methods and analytical tools from control theory, we demonstrate that the presence of loading shrinks the region of parameter space where a gene circuit performs the desired function. A number of multi-module synthetic gene circuits are analyzed to demonstrate this point, including an event detector and a molecular signature classifier. These results indicate that for designing genetic circuits that are robust to parameter uncertainty it is highly desirable to find ways to mitigate the effects of transcription factor loading.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEfforts to understand how loads affect gene transcription networks have been underway in the past decade. Here we perform a numerical investigation on three synthetic gene circuits to show that loads tend to decrease the robustness of stable gene transcriptional networks. We complement the numerical findings with analytical derivations that employ the stability radius to compare the robustness of different networks to parameter perturbations near an equilibrium point. Consistent with the numerical finding, the analytical results support that systems with substantial transcription factor loading have smaller stability radius (less robustness) than systems without loading.",

In order to analyze and summarize genetic markers related to diagnosis and prognosis of rectal cancer.\\n\\nMethodsthe genes expression profile was downloaded from OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) database; the protein-protein interaction network of rectal cancer was established by Cytoscape; the molecular complexes in the network were detected by Clusterviz plugin and the pathways enrichment of molecular complexes were performed by DAVID online and Bingo (The Biological Networks Gene Ontology tool).\\n\\nResults and DiscussionA total of 127 rectal cancer genes were identified to differentially express in OMIM Database. The protein-protein interaction network of rectal cancer was contained 966 nodes (proteins), 3377 edges (interactive relationships) and 7 molecular complexes (score>7.0). Regulatory effects of genes and proteins were focused on cell cycle, transcription regulation and cellular protein metabolic process. Genes of DDK1, sparcl1, wisp2, cux1, pabpc1, ptk2 and htral were significant nodes in PPI network. The discovery of featured genes which were probably related to rectal cancer, has a great significance on studying mechanism, distinguishing normal and cancer tissues, and exploring new treatments for rectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "The epigenetic modifications are organized in patterns determining the functional properties of the underlying genome. Such patterns, typically measured by ChIP-seq assays of histone modifications, can be combined and translated into musical scores, summarizing multiple signals into a single waveform. As music is recognized as a universal way to convey meaningful information (1), we wanted to investigate properties of music obtained by sonification of ChIP-seq data. We show that the music produced by such quantitative signals is perceived by human listener as more pleasant than that produced from randomized signals. Moreover, the waveform can be analyzed to predict phenotypic properties, such as differential gene expression.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMusic is recognized as universal way to communicate emotions and, more in general, meaningful information. Various sources of information can be translated into music or sounds, mostly for recreational purposes. It has been shown that human ear can classify information encoded into sounds. Quantitative genomic features, and in particular epigenetic marks, do represent functional information that is exploited by cells to drive biological processes. We test a method to translate such information into music and we study some properties of the sonificated chromatin marks. We show that not only musical representation of epigenetic marks has intrinsic musicality, but also that differences in musical representation of genomic loci reflect differences of the RNA levels of the underlying genes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChronic pain is highly prevalent worldwide and a significant source of disability, yet its genetic and environmental risk factors are poorly understood. Its relationship with psychiatric illness, and major depressive disorder (MDD) in particular, is of particular importance. We sought to test the contribution of genetic factors and shared and unique environment to risk of chronic pain and its correlation with MDD in Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS). We then sought to replicate any significant findings in the UK Biobank study.\\n\\nMethodsUsing family-based mixed-model analyses, we examined the contribution of genetics and environment to chronic pain using spouse, sibling and household groups as measures of shared environment. We then examined the correlation between chronic pain and MDD and estimated the contribution of genetic factors and shared environment. Finally, we used data from two independent genome-wide association studies to test whether chronic pain has a polygenic risk architecture and examine whether genomic risk of psychiatric disorder predicted chronic pain and whether genomic risk of chronic pain predicted MDD.\\n\\nResultsChronic pain is a moderately heritable trait (narrow sense heritability = 38.4%) which is more likely to be concordant in spouses and partners (variance explained 18.7%). Chronic pain is positively correlated with depression (rho = 0.13, p = 2.72x10-68) and it shows a tendency to cluster within families for genetic reasons (genetic correlation rho = 0.51, p = 8.24x10-19). Polygenic risk profiles for pain, generated using independent GWAS data, predicted chronic pain in both GS:SFHS (maximum {beta} = 6.18x10-2, p = 4.3x10-4) and UK Biobank (maximum {beta} = 5.68 x 10-2, p < 3x10-4). Genomic risk of MDD is also significantly associated with chronic pain in both GS:SFHS (maximum {beta} = 6.62x10-2, p = 4.3x10-4) and UK Biobank (maximum {beta} = 2.56x10-2, p < 3x10-4).\\n\\nConclusionsGenetic factors and chronic pain in a partner or spouse contribute substantially to the risk of chronic pain in the general population. Chronic pain is genetically correlated with MDD, has a polygenic architecture and is predicted by polygenic risk of MDD.",

    "abstract": "In Reticulitermes chinensis, a close relative of R. speratus with asexual queen succession, unfertilized eggs can be produced but are not incubated. To explain this phenomenon, we analysed the physiological differences between unfertilized eggs/unmated queens and fertilized eggs/mated queens. Fertilized eggs consumed significantly larger quantities of five amino acids (Cys, Met, Ile, Leu and Tyr), Ca, protein and cholesterol during incubation. The higher levels of four trace elements (Na, K, Zn and Fe) in fertilized eggs and their lower levels in mated queens indicated that mated queens might transfer these trace elements to fertilized eggs to complete incubation. The higher levels of Mn, triglycerides and serotonin in mated queens and higher levels of Mn and glucose in fertilized eggs suggested that these substances are very important for normal ovarian and embryonic growth. The different expression of three reproductive genes (vtgl, rabil and JHE1) suggested that they might be involved in the regulation of ovarian and embryonic growth. Overall, changes in these physiological indices may substantially affect ovarian and embryonic growth and prohibit the incubation of unfertilized eggs in R. chinensis.",
