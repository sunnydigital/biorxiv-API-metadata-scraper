    "abstract": "In 2011, the \\\"ADHD-200 Global Competition\\\" was held with the aim of identifying biomarkers of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI (s-MRI) data collected on 973 individuals. Statisticians and computer scientists were potentially the most qualified for the machine learning aspect of the competition, but generally lacked the specialized skills to implement the necessary steps of data preparation for rs-fMRI. Realizing this barrier to entry, the Neuro Bureau prospectively collaborated with all competitors by preprocessing the data and sharing these results at the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC) (http://www.nitrc.org/frs/?group_id=383). This \\\"ADHD-200 Preprocessed\\\" release included multiple analytical pipelines to cater to different philosophies of data analysis. The processed derivatives included denoised and registered 4D fMRI volumes, regional time series extracted from brain parcellations, maps of 10 intrinsic connectivity networks, fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation, and regional homogeneity, along with grey matter density maps. The data was used by several teams who competed in the ADHD-200 Global Competition, including the winning entry by a group of biostaticians. To the best of our knowledge, the ADHD-200 Preprocessed release was the first large public resource of preprocessed resting-state fMRI and structural MRI data, and remains to this day the only resource featuring a battery of alternative processing paths.",

    "abstract": "Tissue culture propagation system was developed for Aristolochia tagala, a threatened medicinal plant, using apical bud explants. The most effective medium was found to be MS medium supplemented with BAP (3 M), KIN (0.5 M) and activated charcoal (0.1%). The addition of activated charcoal helped in circumventing the problem of polyphenol exudation from the explants which hampered the regeneration of adventitious shoots. A maximum of 12.6 shoots were obtained on average from the apical bud explants after 25 days of inoculation. Well developed shoots were rooted on MS medium supplemented with indole acetic acid (1.5 M), Kinetin (1.5 M) and 6-benzylaminopurine (0.5 M). Regenerated shoots from the apical buds were successfully rooted and acclimated to greenhouse conditions. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of bioactive compounds was done at various stages of development, so as establish the effect of culture conditions on the production of bioactive components. Comparisons were made between three types of plant material from the same clone: leaves from field-grown plant, leaves from in vitro apical bud cultures and leaf derived callus. It was observed that the leaf derived callus showed the presence of components which were not there in the in vivo leaves, suggesting the influence of in vitro developmental conditions.\\n\\nTagalaSummary Statement\\n\\nThis is the first report on direct regeneration of Aristolochia tagala, (a threatened yet important medicinal plant) using apical bud explants derived from mature plants. Also, for the very first time we report the results of analysis of secondary metabolites during its various stages of in vitro development.\\n\\nAbbreviationsAC - activated charcoal; BAP - 6-benzylaminopurine; 2,4-D - 2,4- dichloro phenoxyacetic acid, IAA - indole acetic acid, IBA - indolebutyric acid, KIN- kinetin, MS- Murashige and Skoog (1962); NAA- -naphthaleneacetic acid.",
