    "abstract": "BackgroundOncology drugs are only effective in a small proportion of cancer patients. Our current ability to identify these responsive patients before treatment is still poor in most cases. Thus, there is a pressing need to discover response markers for marketed and research oncology drugs in order to improve patient survival, reduce healthcare costs and enhance success rates in clinical trials. Screening these drugs against a large panel of cancer cell lines has been employed to discover new genomic markers of in vitro drug response, which can now be further evaluated on more accurate tumour models. However, while the identification of discriminative markers among thousands of candidate drug-gene associations in the data is error-prone, an appraisal of the effectiveness of such detection task is currently lacking.\\n\\nResultsHere we present a new non-parametric method to measuring the discriminative power of a drug-gene association. This is enabled by the identification of an auxiliary threshold posing this task as a binary classification problem. Unlike parametric statistical tests, the adopted non-parametric test has the advantage of not making strong assumptions about the data distorting the identification of genomic markers. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark to further validate these markers in vitro using more recent data not used to identify the markers. The application of this new methodology has led to the identification of 128 new genomic markers distributed across 61% of the analysed drugs, including 5 drugs without previously known markers, which were missed by the MANOVA test initially applied to analyse data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer consortium.\\n\\nAbbreviation",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThree to four gene expression-based subtypes of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) have been previously reported. We sought to systematically determine the similarity of HGSC subtypes between populations.\\n\\nMethodsWe independently clustered (k = 3 and k = 4) five publicly-available HGSC mRNA expression datasets with >130 tumors using k-means and non-negative matrix factorization. Within each population, we summarized differential expression patterns for each cluster as moderated t statistic vectors using Significance Analysis of Microarrays. We calculated Pearsons correlations of these vectors to determine similarities and differences in expression patterns between clusters. We defined syn-clusters (SC) as sets of clusters that were strongly correlated across populations, and associated their expression patterns with biological pathways using geneset overrepresentation analyses.\\n\\nResultsAcross populations, for k = 3, moderated t score correlations for clusters 1, 2 and 3, respectively, ranged between 0.77-0.85, 0.80-0.90, and 0.65-0.77. For k = 4, correlations for clusters 1-4, respectively, ranged between 0.77-0.85, 0.83-0.89, 0.51-0.76, and 0.61-0.75. Within populations, comparing analogous clusters (k = 3 versus k = 4), correlations were high for clusters 1 and 2 (0.91-1.00), but were lower for cluster 3 (0.22-0.80). Results are similar using non-negative matrix factorization. SC1 corresponds to previously-reported mesenchymal-like, SC2 to proliferative-like, SC3 to immunoreactive-like, and SC4 to differentiated-like subtypes.\\n\\nConclusionsThe mesenchymal-like and proliferative-like subtypes are remarkably consistent across populations and could be uniquely targeted for treatment. The other two previously described subtypes are considerably less robust, and since cross-population comparison reveals that k = 3 and k = 4 are both consistent with our results, they may not represent clear subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Ever since the accidental discovery of Wingless [Sharma R.P., Drosophila information service, 1973, 50, p 134], research in the field of Wnt signaling pathway has taken significant strides in wet lab experiments and various cancer clinical trials augmented by recent developments in advanced computational modeling of the pathway. Information rich gene expression profiles reveal various aspects of the signaling pathway at work and help in studying different issues simultaneously. Hitherto, not many computational studies exist which incorporate the simultaneous study of these issues. This manuscript is an endeavour to * explore the strength of contributing factors in the signaling pathway, * analyze the existing causal relations among the inter/extracellular factors effecting the pathway based on prior biological knowledge and * investigate the deviations in fold changes in the recently found prevalence of psychophysical laws working in the pathway. To achieve this goal, local and global sensitivity analysis is conducted on the (non)linear responses between the factors obtained from static and time series expression profiles using the density (Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion) and variance (Sobol) based sensitivity indices. The results show the superiority of the density based indices in comparison to the use of variance based indices mainly due to the former's employment of distance measures using the kernel trick via Reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that capture nonlinear relations among various intra/extracellular factors of the pathway in a higher dimensional space. In time series data, using these indices it is now possible to observe where in time, which factors get influenced & contribute to the pathway, as changes in concentration of the other factors are made. This synergy of prior biological knowledge, sensitivity analysis and representations in higher dimensional spaces can facilitate in time based administration of target therapeutic drugs and reveal hidden biological information within colorectal cancer samples.

    "abstract": "Cortical mapping techniques using fMRI have been instrumental in identifying the boundaries of topological (neighbor-preserving) maps in early sensory areas. The presence of topological maps beyond early sensory areas raises the possibility that they might play a significant role in other cognitive systems, and that topological mapping might help to delineate areas involved in higher cognitive processes. In this study, we combine surface based visual, auditory, and somatomotor mapping methods with a naturalistic reading comprehension task in the same group of subjects to provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the cortical overlap between sensory-motor maps in all major sensory modalities, and reading processing regions. Our results suggest that cortical activation during naturalistic reading comprehension overlaps more extensively with topological sensory-motor maps than has been heretofore appreciated. Reading activation in regions adjacent to occipital lobe and inferior parietal lobe completely overlaps visual maps, whereas most of frontal activation for reading in dorsolateral and ventral prefrontal cortex overlaps both visual and auditory maps. Even classical language regions in superior temporal cortex are partially overlapped by topological visual and auditory maps. By contrast, the main overlap with somatomotor maps is restricted to dorsolateral frontal cortex.",

    "abstract": "Plants have evolved elaborate mechanisms controlling developmental responses to environmental stimuli. A particularly important stimulus is temperature. Previous work has identified the interplay of PIF4 and ELF3 as a central circuit underlying thermal responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, thermal responses vary widely among strains, possibly offering mechanistic insights into the wiring of this circuit. ELF3 contains a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract that is crucial for ELF3 function and varies in length across strains. Here, we use transgenic analysis to test the hypothesis that natural polyQ variation in ELF3 is associated with the observed natural variation in thermomorphogenesis. We found little evidence that the polyQ tract plays a specific role in thermal responses beyond modulating general ELF3 function. Instead, we made the serendipitous discovery that ELF3 plays a crucial, PIF4-independent role in thermoresponsive flowering under conditions more likely to reflect field conditions. We present evidence that ELF3 acts through the photoperiodic pathway, pointing to a previously unknown symmetry between low and high ambient temperature responses. Moreover, in analyzing two strain backgrounds with vastly different thermal responses, we demonstrate that responses may be shifted rather than fundamentally rewired across strains. Our findings tie together disparate observations into a coherent framework in which multiple pathways converge in accelerating flowering in response to temperature, with some such pathways modulated by photoperiod.",

    "abstract": "Water availability is an important driver of the geographic distribution of many plant species, although its importance relative to other climatic variables varies across climate regimes and species. A common indirect measure of water-use efficiency (WUE) is the ratio of carbon isotopes ({delta}13C) fixed during photosynthesis, especially when analyzed in conjunction with a measure of leaf-level resource utilization ({delta}15N). Here, we test two hypotheses about the genetic architecture of WUE for foxtail pine (Pinus balfouriana Grev. & Balf.) using a novel mixture of double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing, species distribution modeling, and quantitative genetics. First, we test the hypothesis that water availability is an important determinant of the geographical range of foxtail pine. Second, we test the hypothesis that variation in {delta}13C and {delta}15N is genetically based, differentiated between regional populations, and has genetic architectures that include loci of large effect. We show that precipitation-related variables structured the geographical range of foxtail pine, climate-based niches differed between regional populations, and {delta}13C and {delta}15N were heritable with moderate signals of differentiation between regional populations. A set of large-effect QTLs (n = 11 for {delta}13C; n = 10 for {delta}15N) underlying {delta}13C and {delta}15N variation, with little to no evidence of pleiotropy, was discovered using multiple-marker, half-sibling regression models. Our results represent a first approximation to the genetic architecture of these phenotypic traits, including documentation of several patterns consistent with {delta}13C being a fitness-related trait affected by natural selection.",

We found that the secreted fusion proteins do not re-enter plant cells from the apoplast and that the assay is prone to false-positives.

    "abstract": "We introduce a new Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale hypothesis testing, including estimating False Discovery Rates (FDRs), and effect sizes. This approach has two key differences from existing approaches to FDR analysis. First, it assumes that the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal, with a mode at 0. This \\\"unimodal assumption\\\" (UA), although natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into standard FDR analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it brings many benefits. Specifically, the UA facilitates efficient and robust computation - estimating the unimodal distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization problem - and enables more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect size estimate, and corresponding standard error), rather than the one number usually used (p value, or z score). When available, using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates estimation of effects, and unlike standard FDR methods our approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition to measures of significance. To provide a bridge between interval estimates and significance measures we introduce the term \\\"local false sign rate\\\" to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong, and argue that it is a superior measure of significance than the local FDR because it is both more generally applicable, and can be more robustly estimated. Our methods are implemented in an R package ashr available from http://github.com/stephens999/ashr.",

Here, we apply single-cell analysis of signal transduction and proliferation to probe cellular responses to small molecule inhibitors. We use the model of cellular activation of T lymphocytes responding to cytokines and antigens. We uncover two distinct modes of drug action, in terms of signaling inhibition: digital inhibition (e.g. when the fraction of activated cells diminishes upon drug treatment, but cells remaining active appear unperturbed), and analog inhibition (e.g. when the fraction of activated cells is unperturbed while their overall activation is diminished). We introduce a computational model of the signaling cascade in order to account for such dichotomy. We test the predictions of our model in terms of the phenotypic variability of cellular responses under drug inhibition. Finally, we demonstrate that the digital/analog dichotomy of cellular response as revealed on short timescales with signal transduction, translates into similar dichotomy on long timescales. Overall, our analysis of drug action at the single cell level illustrates the strength of quantitative approaches to translate the promise of in vitro pharmacology into functionally-relevant cellular settings.",
