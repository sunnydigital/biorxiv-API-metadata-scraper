    "abstract": "Sexual transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) 6 months after onset of symptoms has been recently documented, and Ebola virus RNA has been detected in semen of survivors up to 9 months after onset of symptoms. As countries affected by the 2013-2015 epidemic in West Africa, by far the largest to date, are declared free of Ebola virus disease (EVD), it remains unclear what threat is posed by rare sexual transmission events that could arise from survivors. We devised a novel mathematical model that includes sexual transmission from convalescent survivors: a SEICR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-convalescent-recovered) transmission model. We fitted the model to weekly incidence of EVD cases from the 2014-2015 epidemic in Sierra Leone. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations showed that a 0.1% per sex act transmission probability and a 3-month convalescent period (the two key unknown parameters of sexual transmission) create very few additional cases, but would extend the epidemic by 83 days [95% CI: 68-98 days] (p < 0.0001) on average. Strikingly, a 6-month convalescent period extended the average epidemic by 540 days (95% CI: 508-572 days), doubling the current length, despite an insignificant rise in the number of new cases generated. Our results show that current recommendations for abstinence and condom use should reduce the number of sporadic sexual transmission events, but will not reduce the length of time the public health community must stay vigilant. While the number of infectious survivors is expected to greatly decline over the coming months, our results show that transmission events may still be expected for quite some time as each event results in a new potential cluster of non-sexual transmission. Precise measurement of the convalescent period is thus important for planning ongoing surveillance efforts.",

    "abstract": "Negative and positive experiences can exert a strong influence on later memory. Our emotional experiences are composed of many different elements - people, place, things - most of them neutral. Do emotional experiences lead to enhanced long-term for these neutral elements as well? Demonstrating a lasting effect of emotion on memory is particularly important if memory for emotional events is to adaptively guide behavior days, weeks, or years later. We thus tested whether aversive experiences modulate very long-term episodic memory in an fMRI experiment. Participants experienced episodes of high or low pain in conjunction with the presentation of incidental, trial-unique neutral object pictures. In a scanned surprise immediate memory test, we found no effect of pain on recognition strength. Critically, in a follow-up memory test one year later we found that pain significantly enhanced memory. Neurally, we provide a novel demonstration of activity predicting memory one year later, whereby greater insula activity and more unique distributed patterns of insular activity in the initial session correlated with memory for pain-associated objects. Generally, our results suggest that pairing episodes with arousing negative stimuli may lead to very long-lasting memory enhancements.",

It is not entirely clear how the scale and physical heterogeneity of surrounding catchment, its ecological composition, and larger landscape gradients work together to sustain littoral communities.\\n\\nA total of 114 alpine lakes in the central Pyrenees were surveyed to evaluate the functional connectivity between catchment physical and ecological elements and littoral zoobenthos, and ascertain their effect on community formation. At each lake, the zoobenthic composition was assessed together with geolocation (altitude, latitude and longitude), catchment hydrodynamics, geomorphology, topography, riparian vegetation composition, the presence of trout and frogs, water pH and conductivity.\\n\\nUni- and multidimensional fuzzy set ordination models integrating benthic biota and environmental variables revealed that at geographical scale longitude surpassed altitude in its effect on littoral ecosystem, reflecting a sharp transition between Atlantic and Mediterranean bioregions. Topography (through its control of catchment type, summer snow coverage, and connectivity with other lakes) was the largest catchment-scale driver, followed by hydrodynamics (waterbody size, type and inflow/outflow volumes). Locally, riparian plant composition significantly related to littoral community structure, richness and morphotype diversity. These variables, directly and indirectly create habitats for aquatic and terrestrial stages of invertebrates, and control nutrient and water cycles. Three ecologically diverse associations characterised distinct lake sets. Vertebrate predation, water conductivity and pH (broad measures of total dissolved ions/nutrients and their bioavailability) had no major influence on littoral taxa.\\n\\nThe work provides exhaustive information from relatively pristine sites, which unveil a strong connection between littoral ecosystem and catchment heterogeneity at scales beyond the local environment. This underpins their role as sensors of local and large-scale environmental changes, and can be used to evaluate further impacts.",

    "abstract": "An ecosystem is generally sustained by a set of integrated physical elements forming a functional landscape unit - ecotope, which supplies nutrients, microclimate, and exchanges matter and energy with the wider environment. To better predict environmental change effects on ecosystems, particularly in critically sensitive regions such as high altitudes, it is imperative to recognise how their natural landscape heterogeneity works at different scales to shape habitats and sustain biotic communities prior to major changes.\\n\\nWe conducted a comprehensive survey of catchment physical, geological and ecological properties of 380 high altitude lakes and ponds in the axial Pyrenees at a variety of scales, in order to formulate and test an integrated model encompassing major flows and interactions that drive lake ecosystems.\\n\\nThree composite drivers encompassed most of the variability in lake catchment characteristics. In order of total percentage of variance explained they were: (i) hydrology/hydrodynamics-responsible for type and discharge of inlets/outlets, and for water body size; (ii) bedrock geomorphology, summarizing geology, slope and fractal order-all dictating vegetation cover of catchment slope and lake shore, and the presence of aquatic vegetation; and, (iii) topography, i.e. catchment formation type-driving lakes connectivity, and the presence of summer snow deposits. While driver (i) appeared to be local, (ii) and (iii) showed gradient changes along altitude and latitude. These three drivers differentiated several lake ecotopes based on their landscape similarities. The three-driver model was successfully tested on a riparian vegetation composition dataset, further illustrating the validity and fundamental nature of the concept.\\n\\nThe findings inform on the relative contribution of scale-dependent catchment physical elements to lake ecotope and ecosystem formation in high altitude lakes, which should be considered in any assessment of potentially major deleterious effects due to environmental/climate change.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/034405_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (85K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4b92e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@198fca4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f2801dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b8f588_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Lake Bassia at 2275m a.s.l. in the Pyrenees National Park, France, is one of the millions of remote high altitude lakes worldwide whose catchments are likely to experience severe effects due to climate change.

    "abstract": "Alpine regions are under increased attention worldwide do their role in storing freshwater of high quality and their high sensitivity to climate change - comparable only to the poles. Riparian ecosystems in such regions, integrating water and nutrient fluxes from aquatic and terrestrial environments, host a disproportionally rich biodiversity, despite experiencing severe climate and nutrient restrictions. With climate change rapidly encroaching in the alpine biome, it is important to fully understand how the lake and its surrounding landscape elements sustain such rich ecosystems, before their functional connectivity could be seriously severed.\\n\\nA total of 189 glacial origin lakes in the Central Pyrenees were surveyed to test how key elements of lake and terrestrial environments work together at different scales to shape the riparian plant composition. Secondly, we evaluated how these ecotope features drive the formation of riparian communities potentially sensitive to environmental change, and assessed their habitat distribution. At each lake plant taxonomic composition was assessed together with elemental composition of water and sediment and ecosystem-relevant geographical factors.\\n\\nAt macroscale vegetation composition responded to pan-climatic gradients altitude and latitude, which captured, in a narrow geographic area the transition between large European climatic zones. Hydrodynamics was the main catchment-scale factor connecting riparian vegetation with large-scale water fluxes, followed by topography and geomorphology. Lake sediment Mg and Pb, and water Mn and Fe contents reflected local connections with nutrient availability, and water saturation of the substrate.\\n\\nCommunity analysis identified four keystone plant communities of large niche breadths, present in a wide range of habitats, from (i) damp environments, (ii) snow bed-silicate bedrock, (iii) wet heath, and (iv) limestone bedrock.

    "abstract": "Currently quantitative RNA-Seq methods are pushed to work with increasingly small starting amounts of RNA that require amplification. However, it is unclear how much noise or bias amplification introduces and how this effects precision and accuracy of RNA quantification. To assess the effects of amplification, reads that originated from the same RNA molecule (PCR-duplicates) need to be identified. Computationally, read duplicates are defined via their mapping position, which does not distinguish PCR- from natural duplicates and hence it is unclear how to treat duplicate reads.\\n\\nHere, we generate and analyse RNA-seq datasets prepared using three different protocols (Smart-Seq, TruSeq and UMI-seq). We find that a large fraction of computationally identified read duplicates can be explained by sampling and fragmentation bias. Consequently, the computational removal of duplicates does not improve accuracy, power or FDR, but can actually worsen them. Even when duplicates are experimentally identified by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), power and FDR are only mildly improved. However, the pooling of samples as made possible by the early barcoding of the UMI-protocol leads to an appreciable increase in the power to detect differentially expressed genes.",

Finding  actionable knowledge is becoming more important, but also more challenging as datasets grow in size and complexity. We present  Logic Optimization for Binary Input to Continuous Output (LOBICO), a computational approach that infers small and easily interpretable logic models of binary input features that explain a binarized continuous output variable. Although the continuous output variable is binarized prior to optimization, the continuous information is retained to find the optimal logic model. Applying LOBICO to a large cancer cell line panel, we find that logic combinations of multiple mutations are more predictive of drug response than single gene predictors. Importantly, we show that the use of the continuous information leads to robust and more accurate logic models. LOBICO is formulated as an integer programming problem, which enables rapid computation on large datasets. Moreover, LOBICO implements the ability to uncover logic models around predefined operating points in terms of sensitivity and specificity. As such, it represents an important step towards practical application of interpretable logic models.",

    "abstract": "A major goal of speciation research is to reveal the genomic signatures that accompany the speciation process. Genome scans are routinely used to explore genome-wide variation and identify highly differentiated loci that may contribute to ecological divergence, but they do not incorporate spatial, phenotypic, or environmental data that might enhance outlier detection. Geographic cline analysis provides a potential framework for integrating diverse forms of data in a spatially-explicit framework, but it has not been used to study genome-wide patterns of divergence. Aided by a first-draft genome assembly, we combine an FCT scan and geographic cline analysis to characterize patterns of genome-wide divergence between divergent pollination ecotypes of Mimulus aurantiacus. FCT analysis of 58,872 SNPs generated via RADseq revealed little ecotypic differentiation (mean FCT = 0.041), though a small number of loci were moderately to highly diverged. Consistent with our previous results from the gene MaMyb2, which contributes to differences in flower color, 130 loci have cline shapes that recapitulate the spatial pattern of trait divergence, suggesting that they reside in or near the genomic regions that contribute to pollinator isolation. In the narrow hybrid zone between the ecotypes, extensive admixture among individuals and low linkage disequlibrium between markers indicate that outlier loci are scattered throughout the genome, rather than being restricted to one or a few regions. In addition to revealing the genomic consequences of ecological divergence in this system, we discuss how geographic cline analysis is a powerful but under-utilized framework for studying genome-wide patterns of divergence.",

    "abstract": "The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) has been linked to the accumulation and comparison of perceptual evidence for decision making independent of sensory and response modalities. We investigated the possible neural dynamics underlying the role of dlPFC in perceptual decision making, through a combination of noninvasive neurostimulation in humans and computational modeling. First, we used an established and biophysically realistic model of a decision making network that employs competition between neural populations. Simulation of depolarizing noninvasive brain stimulation in this model decreased decision time, while hyperpolarizing stimulation increased it. This behavioral effect was caused by an increase in the rate of neural activity integration via recurrent connections, as well as changes in the susceptibility of the network to noisy background inputs which modulated population firing rate differences prior to the onset of the stimulus. These pre-stimulus differences biased the response to one or the other option, thus speeding or slowing decisions.\\n\\nWe then tested these model predictions in healthy participants performing a perceptual decision making task while receiving transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left dlPFC, analogous to our simulated network stimulation. We found a striking match between model predictions and experimental results: depolarizing (inward) currents reduced and hyperpolarizing (outward) currents increased response times, but accuracy remained unaffected. Our results provide interventional evidence for the role of left dlPFC in perceptual decision making, and suggest that this region integrates and compares sensory evidence through competitive interactions between pyramidal cell populations which are selective for each response option. Mechanistically, our model suggests that stimulation of this region changes the rate at which evidence can be accumulated through recurrent activity and its susceptibility to background noise. More generally, our approach demonstrates that a linkage between computational modeling and noninvasive brain stimulation allows mechanistic accounts of brain function to be causally tested.",

Accompanying skeletal aberrations may compromise the general condition and locomotion of affected individuals. Several paternal half sibs with low birth weight and size were born in 2013 in the Fleckvieh cattle population.\\n\\nResultsAffected calves were strikingly underweight at birth despite a normal gestation length and had craniofacial abnormalities such as elongated narrow heads and brachygnathia inferior. Despite a normal general condition, their growth remained restricted during rearing. We genotyped 27 affected and 10,454 unaffected animals at 44,672 SNPs and performed association testing followed by homozygosity mapping to map the growth failure to a 1.85 Mb segment on bovine chromosome 3. Analysis of whole-genome re-sequencing data from one affected and 289 unaffected animals revealed a 1bp deletion (g.15079217delC, rs723240647) in the coding region of the GON4L gene that segregated with the dwarfism-associated haplotype. We show that the deletion introduces intron retention and premature termination of translation, putatively resulting in a severely truncated protein that lacks domains that are likely essential to normal protein function. The widespread use of an unnoticed carrier bull for artificial insemination has resulted in a tenfold increase in the frequency of the deleterious allele in the female population.\\n\\nConclusionsA frameshift mutation in GON4L is associated with autosomal recessive proportionate dwarfism in Fleckvieh cattle. The mutation has segregated in the population for more than fifty years without being recognized as a genetic disorder. However, the widespread use of an unnoticed carrier bull for artificial insemination caused a sudden accumulation of homozygous calves with dwarfism. Our findings provide the basis for genome-based mating strategies to avoid the inadvertent mating of carrier animals and thereby prevent the birth of homozygous calves with impaired growth.",

We propose a novel method that departs from standard analysis pipelines, comparing and clustering cells based not on their transcript or gene quantifications but on their transcript-compatibility read counts. In re-analysis of two landmark yet disparate single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we show that our method is up to two orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches, provides accurate and in some cases improved results, and is directly applicable to data from a wide variety of assays.",

    "abstract": "Implantable neuronal interfaces to the brain are an important keystone for future medical applications. However, entering this field of research is difficult since such an implant requires components from many different areas of technology. Since the complete avoidance of wires is important due to the risk of infections and other long-term problems, means for wireless transmitting data and energy are a necessity which adds to the requirements. In recent literature many high-tech components for such implants are presented with remarkable properties. However, these components are typically not freely available for your system. Every group needs to re-develop their own solution. This raises the question if it is possible to create a reusable design for an implant and its external base-station, such that it allows other groups to use it as a starting point. In this article we try to answer this question by presenting a design based exclusively on commercial off-the-shelf components and studying the properties of the resulting system. Following this idea, we present a fully wireless neuronal implant for simultaneously measuring electrocorticography signals at 128 locations from the surface of the brain. All design files are available as open source.",

    "abstract": "Animal lifespan can be extended by dietary restriction (DR), but at a cost to fitness. This phenomenon depends on essential amino acids (EAAs) and TOR signalling, but roles of specific tissues and downstream transcriptional regulators are poorly characterised. Manipulating relevant transcription factors (TFs) specifically in lifespan-limiting tissues may ameliorate ageing without costs of DR. Here we identify TFs which regulate the DR phenotype in Drosophila, analysing organs as an interacting system and reducing its transcriptional complexity by two orders of magnitude. Evolutionarily conserved GATA TFs are predicted to regulate the overlapping effects of DR and TOR on organs, and genetic analyses confirmed that these TFs interact with diet to determine lifespan. Importantly, Srp knockdown insulated fly lifespan from the pernicious effects of EAAs, but tissue-specific knockdown reduced the corrolary costs. These results provide the first indication that benefits of EAAs for early-life fitness can be decoupled from longevity by tissue-specific transcriptional reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAnalysis of organism-specific interactomes has yielded novel insights into cellular function and coordination, understanding of pathology, and identification of markers and drug targets. Genes, however, can exhibit varying levels of cell-type specificity in their expression, and their coordinated expression manifests in tissue-specific function and pathology. Tissue-specific/ selective interaction mechanisms have significant applications in drug discovery, as they are more likely to reveal drug targets. Furthermore, tissue-specific transcription factors (tsTFs) are significantly implicated in human disease, including cancers. Finally, disease genes and protein complexes have the tendency to be differentially expressed in tissues in which defects cause pathology. These observations motivate the construction of refined tissue-specific interactomes from organism-specific interactomes.\\n\\nResultsWe present a novel technique for constructing human tissue-specific interactomes. Using a variety of validation tests (ESEA, GO Enrichment, Disease-Gene Subnetwork Compactness), we show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state of the art techniques. Finally, using case studies of Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases, we show that tissue-specific interactomes derived from our study can be used to construct pathways implicated in pathology and demonstrate the use of these pathways in identifying novel targets.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/mohammas/projects/ActPro.html",

    "abstract": "In clinical practice and biomedical research populations are often divided categorically into distinct racial/ethnic groups. In reality, these categories, which are based on social rather than biological constructs, comprise diverse groups with highly heterogeneous histories, cultures, traditions, religions, social and environmental exposures and ancestral backgrounds. Their use is thus widely debated and genetic ancestry has been suggested as a complement or alternative to this categorization. However, few studies have examined the relative contributions of racial/ethnic identity, genetic ancestry, and environmental exposures on well-established and fundamental biological processes. We examined the associations between ethnicity, ancestry, and environmental exposures and DNA methylation. We typed over 450,000 CpG sites in primary whole blood of 573 individuals of diverse Hispanic descent who also had high-density genotype data. We found that both self-identified ethnicity and genetically determined ancestry were significantly associated with methylation levels at a large number of CpG sites (916 and 194, respectively). Among loci differentially methylated between ethnic groups, a median of 75.7% (IQR 45.8% to 92%) of the variance in methylation associated with ethnicity could be accounted for by shared genomic ancestry accounts. We also found significant enrichment (p = 4.2 x 10-64) of ethnicity-associated sites amongst loci previously associated with environmental and social exposures, particularly maternal smoking during pregnancy. Our study suggests that although differential methylation between ethnic groups can be partially explained by the shared genetic ancestry, a significant effect of ethnicity is likely due to environmental, social, or cultural factors, which differ between ethnic groups.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryIn order to better understand the role of ethnic self-identification and genetically determined ancestry in biomedical outcomes, we explore their relative contributions to variation in methylation, a fundamental biological process.\\n\\nSources of FundingThis research was supported in part by the Sandler Family Foundation, the American Asthma Foundation, National Institutes of Health (P60 MD006902, R01 HL117004, R21ES24844, U54MD009523, R01 ES015794, R01 HL088133, M01 RR000083, R01 HL078885, R01 HL104608, U19 AI077439, M01 RR00188, U01 HG009080, and R01 HL135156), ARRA grant RC2 HL101651, and TRDRP 24RT-0025; EGB was supported in part through grants from the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute (FAMRI), and NIH (K23 HL004464); NZ was supported in part by an NIH career development award from the NHLBI (K25HL121295).

We also compared these populations to lines evolved under a mutation-accumulation regime that minimizes selection. Nonsynonymous mutations, intergenic mutations, insertions, and deletions are overrepresented in the long-term populations, supporting the inference that most fixed mutations are favored by selection.

We describe a protocol for freezing cells that is compatible with ATAC-Seq, producing results that compare well with those generated from fresh cells. We found that while flash-frozen samples are not suitable for ATAC-Seq, the assay is successful with slow-cooled cryopreserved samples. Using this method, we were able to isolate high quality, intact nuclei, and we verified that epigenetic results from fresh and cryopreserved samples agree quantitatively.

    "abstract": "Bacteria and archaea reproduce clonally (vertical descent), but exchange genes by recombination (horizontal transfer). Recombination allows adaptive mutations or genes to spread rapidly within (or even between) species, and reduces the burden of deleterious mutations. Clonality - defined here as the balance between vertical and horizontal inheritance - is therefore a key microbial trait, determining how quickly a population can adapt and the size of its gene pool. Here, I discuss whether clonality varies over time and if it can be considered a stable trait of a given population. I show that, in some cases, clonality is clearly not static. For example, non-clonal (highly recombining) populations can give rise to clonal expansions, often of pathogens. However, an analysis of time-course metagenomic data from a lake suggests that a bacterial populations past clonality (as measured by its genetic diversity) is a good predictor of its future clonality. Clonality therefore appears to be relatively - but not completely - stable over evolutionary time.",

However, inferring structures from raw contact data is a tedious process for shortage of available tools. Here we present TADbit, a computational framework to analyze and model the chromatin fiber in three dimensions. To illustrate the use of TADbit, we automatically modeled 50 genomic domains from the fly genome revealing differential structural features of the previously defined chromatin colors, establishing a link between the conformation of the genome and the local chromatin composition. More generally, TADbit allows to obtain three-dimensional models ready for visualization from 3C-based experiments and to characterize their relation to gene expression and epigenetic states.

Several invasion fitness measures, such as basic reproductive number, lifetime dispersal success of a local lineage, or inclusive fitness have been proposed to address this question, but the relationships between them and their generality remains unclear. Here, we ascertain uninvadability (all mutant strategies always go extinct) in terms of the growth rate of a mutant allele arising as a single copy in a population. We show from this growth rate that uninvadability is equivalently characterized by at least three conceptually distinct invasion fitness measures: (i) lineage fitness, giving the average personal fitness of a randomly sampled mutant lineage member; (ii) inclusive fitness, giving a reproductive value weighted average of the direct fitness cost and relatedness weighted indirect fitness benefits accruing to a randomly sampled mutant lineage member; and (iii) three types of reproductive numbers, giving lifetime success of a local lineage. Our analysis connects approaches that have been deemed different, generalizes the exact version of inclusive fitness to class-structured populations, and provides a biological interpretation of selection on a mutant allele under arbitrary strength of selection.",

    "abstract": "Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) are mutation-prone loci that span nearly 1% of the human genome. Previous studies have estimated the mutation rates of highly polymorphic STRs using capillary electrophoresis and pedigree-based designs. While this work has provided insights into the mutational dynamics of highly mutable STRs, the mutation rates of most others remain unknown. Here, we harnessed whole-genome sequencing data to estimate the mutation rates of Y-chromosome STRs (Y-STRs) with 2-6 base pair repeat units that are accessible to Illumina sequencing. We genotyped 4,500 Y-STRs using data from the 1000 Genomes Project and the Simons Genome Diversity Project. Next, we developed MUTEA, an algorithm that infers STR mutation rates from population-scale data using a high-resolution SNP-based phylogeny. After extensive intrinsic and extrinsic validations, we harnessed MUTEA to derive mutation rate estimates for 702 polymorphic STRs by tracing each locus over 222,000 meioses, resulting in the largest collection of Y-STR mutation rates to date. Using our estimates, we identified determinants of STR mutation rates and built a model to predict rates for STRs across the genome. These predictions indicate that the load of de novo STR mutations is at least 75 mutations per generation, rivaling the load of all other known variant types. Finally, we identified Y-STRs with potential applications in forensics and genetic genealogy, assessed the ability to differentiate between the Y-chromosomes of father-son pairs, and imputed Y-STR genotypes.",

    "abstract": "About two-thirds of the vital genes in the Drosophila genome are involved in eye development, making the fly eye an excellent genetic system to study cellular function and development, neurodevelopment/degeneration, and complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes. We developed a novel computational method, implemented as Flynotyper software (http://flynotyper.sourceforge.net), to quantitatively assess the morphological defects in the Drosophila eye resulting from genetic alterations affecting basic cellular and developmental processes. Flynotyper utilizes a series of image processing operations to automatically detect the fly eye and the individual ommatidium, and calculates a phenotypic score as a measure of the disorderliness of ommatidial arrangement in the fly eye. As a proof of principle, we tested our method by analyzing the defects due to eye-specific knockdown of Drosophila orthologs of 12 neurodevelopmental genes to accurately document differential sensitivities of these genes to dosage alteration. We also evaluated eye images from six independent studies assessing the effect of overexpression of repeats, candidates from peptide library screens, and modifiers of neurotoxicity and developmental processes on eye morphology, and show strong concordance with the original assessment. We further demonstrate the utility of this method by analyzing 16 modifiers of sine oculis obtained from two genome-wide deficiency screens of Drosophila and accurately quantifying the effect of its enhancers and suppressors during eye development. Our method will complement existing assays for eye phenotypes and increase the accuracy of studies that use fly eyes for functional evaluation of genes and genetic interactions.",

Sickle RBCs damage vasculature, leading to severe symptoms, ultimately diminishing patient quality of life and reducing lifespan.

Corrected HSPCs from SCD patients produce less sickle hemoglobin protein and correspondingly increased wild-type hemoglobin when differentiated into erythroblasts. When injected into immunocompromised mice, treated HSPCs maintain editing long-term at therapeutically relevant levels.
