    "abstract": "The abundance of bacteria in liquid culture is commonly inferred by measuring optical density at 600 nm. Red fluorescent proteins (RFP) can strongly absorb light at 600 nm. Increasing RFP expression can falsely inflate apparent cell density and lead to underestimations of mean per-cell fluorescence by up to 10%. Measuring optical density at 700 nm would allow estimation of cell abundance unaffected by the presence of nearly all fluorescent proteins.",

    "abstract": "Multiple methods have been introduced over the past 30 years to identify the genomic insertion sites of transposable elements and other DNA elements that integrate into genomes. However, each of these methods suffer from limitations that can frustrate attempts to map multiple insertions in a single genome and to map insertions in genomes of high complexity that contain extensive repetitive DNA. I introduce a new method for transposon mapping that is simple to perform, can accurately map multiple insertions per genome, and generates long sequence \\\"reads\\\" that facilitate mapping to complex genomes. The method, called TagMap, for Tagmentation-based Mapping, relies on a modified Tn5 tagmentation protocol with a single tagmentation adaptor followed by PCR using primers specific to the tranposable element and the adaptor sequence. Several minor modifications to normal tagmentation reagents and protocols allow easy and rapid preparation of TagMap libraries. Short read sequencing starting from the adaptor sequence generates oriented reads that flank and are oriented toward the transposable element insertion site. The convergent orientation of adjacent reads at the insertion site allows straightforward prediction of the precise insertion site(s). A Linux shell script is provided to identify insertion sites from fastq files.",

We found a canonical circuit with uniglomerular projection neurons (uPNs) relaying gain-controlled ORN activity to the mushroom body and the lateral horn. A second, parallel circuit with multiglomerular projection neurons (mPNs) and hierarchically connected local neurons (LNs) selectively integrates multiple ORN signals already at the first synapse. LN-LN synaptic connections putatively implement a bistable gain control mechanism that either computes odor saliency through panglomerular inhibition, or allows some glomeruli to respond to faint aversive odors in the presence of strong appetitive odors. This complete wiring diagram will support experimental and theoretical studies towards bridging the gap between circuits and behavior.",

    "abstract": "The precision of the inlet parameters depends on mechanism of response. Reflexes are satisfied with relative higher or lower but if the inlet information is presented by different parameters and the response is calculated according to some equation precision must reach the degree which does not slur over the results of calculation. At recent work the equation for controlling of circulation was suggested where the main inlet parameters are the arterial diastolic and vinous pressures and it becomes pertinent to analyze how organism can perceive these pressures with hydrodynamic accuracy. As far as the velocity pressure component of total pressure can not be detected by wall receptor of the rectilinear section of artery it was noticed that baroreceptors are located at the outer radius of the bend of central arteries and that is justified due to specific distribution of pressure. This phenomenon can be interpreted as a correction of measuring of static pressure with regard for velocity pressure component. Velocity pressure component of venous pressure is comparable with the one of arterial pressure but static components of venous and arterial pressures are incomparable and it is the fact that cannot be ignored when choosing the gauge. The possible method of measuring of pressure is based on observation that pressure-volume vector of the ventricular cycle is similar to a-loop vector of atrial cycle. Ventricular filling vector and x-trough vector show the behavior of viscous material but v-loop inserted into a-loop demonstrates typical viscoelasticity with creep. If viscous deformation of atrium at early relaxation possesses standard duration being stopped by transformation of viscous deformation into viscoelastic deformation the venous pressure can be measured in accordance with the value of viscous deformation. Measuring of pressure by viscous method implemented by atrium has the advantage comparing to measuring by baroreceptor with elastic sensor. Early relaxation of atrium which reveals coefficient of viscosity corresponds to ventricular relaxation and its coefficient of viscosity but the latter is liable to different biochemical shifts. Such shifts influences the atrial coefficient of viscosity either and the values of venous pressure measured by viscous method will be more accurate for calculations because coefficient of viscosity participates in the equation being not estimated in organism.",

For protein-coding genes, the most common null model is that nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations fix at equal rates; this unrealistic model has limited power to detect interesting selection. I describe a new approach that uses a null model based on high-throughput measurements of a genes site-specific amino-acid preferences. This null model makes it possible to identify diversifying selection for amino-acid change and differential selection for mutations to unexpected amino acids. I show that this approach identifies sites of adaptive substitutions in four genes (lactamase, Gal4, influenza nucleoprotein, and influenza hemagglutinin) far better than traditional methods. As rapid increases in biological data enable increasingly nuanced descriptions of the constraints on individual sites, approaches like the one here can greatly improve our ability to identify biologically interesting selection.",

We have demonstrated these methods in an analysis of 23 Infinium data sets from 13 distinct data collection efforts; these empirical evaluations show that our algorithm can reasonably estimate the number of constituent types, return cell proportion estimates that demonstrate anticipated associations with underlying phenotypic data; and methylomes that reflect the underlying biology of constituent cell types. Thus the methodology permits an explicit quantitation of the mediation of phenotypic associations with DNA methylation by cell composition effects. Although more work is needed to investigate functional information related to estimated methylomes, our proposed method provides a novel and useful foundation for conducting DNA methylation studies on heterogeneous tissues lacking reference data.",

However, there are no existing methods to validate the accuracy of these approaches despite the fact that we know there are parameters that can affect whether a SNP is called, or the correct tree is recovered. We present a simulation approach (TreeToReads) to generate raw read data from mutated genomes simulated under a known phylogeny.

    "abstract": "The auditory stimulation method used in experiments on moth A cell(s) is generally believed to be adequate to characterise the encoding of echolocation signals. The stimulation method hosts, though, several bias. Their compounded effects can explain a range of discrepancies between the reported electrophysiological recordings and significantly alter the current interpretation. To test the hypothesis that the bias may significantly alter our current understanding of the moths auditory transducer characteristics, papers using the same auditory stimulation method and reporting on either spiking threshold or spiking activity of the moths A cells were analysed. The consistency of the reported data was assessed. A range of corrections issued from best practices and theoretical background were applied to the data in an attempt to re-interpret the data. We found that it is not possible to apply a posteriori corrections to all data and bias. However the corrected data indicates that the A cells spiking may be (i) independent of the repetition rate, (ii) maximum when detecting the long and low intensity pulses of the bat in searching mode, and (iii) steadily reduce as the bat closes on the moth. These observations raise the possibility that a fixed action pattern drives the mothss erratic evasive manoeuvres until the final moment. In depth investigation of the potential bias also suggest that the auditory transducers response may be constant for a larger frequency range than thought so far, and provide clues to explain the negative taxis in response to the searching batss calls detection.",

    "abstract": "Global climate is changing rapidly and is accompanied by large-scale fragmentation and destruction of habitats. Since dispersal is the first line of defense for mobile organisms to cope with such adversities in their environment, it is important to understand the causes and consequences of evolution of dispersal. Although dispersal is a complex phenomenon involving multiple dispersal-traits like propensity (tendency to leave the natal patch) and ability (to travel long distances), the relationship between these traits is not always straight-forward, it is not clear whether these traits can evolve simultaneously or not, and how their interactions affect the overall dispersal profile. To investigate these issues, we subjected four large (N[~]2500) outbred populations of Drosophila melanogaster to artificial selection for increased dispersal, in a setup that mimicked increasing habitat fragmentation over 33 generations. The propensity and ability of the selected populations were significantly greater than the non-selected controls and the difference persisted even in the absence of proximate drivers for dispersal. The dispersal kernel evolved to have significantly greater standard deviation and reduced values of skew and kurtosis, which ultimately translated into the evolution of a greater frequency of long-distance dispersers (LDDs). We also found that although sex-biased dispersal exists in Drosophila melanogaster, its expression can vary depending on which dispersal component is being measured and the environmental condition under which dispersal takes place. Interestingly though, there was no difference between the two sexes in terms of dispersal evolution. We discuss possible reasons for why some of our results do not agree with previous laboratory and field studies. The rapid evolution of multiple components of dispersal and the kernel, expressed even in the absence of stress, indicates that dispersal evolution cannot be ignored while investigating eco-evolutionary phenomena like speed of range expansion, disease spread, evolution of invasive species and destabilization of metapopulation dynamics.\\n\\nData AccessibilityData will be deposited to dryad if accepted.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements are emerging as an important source of cis-acting regulatory sequences and epigenetic marks that could influence gene expression. However, few studies have dissected the role of specific transposable element insertions on epigenetic gene regulation. Bari-Jheh is a natural transposon that mediates resistance to oxidative stress by adding cis-regulatory sequences that affect expression of nearby genes. In this work, we integrated publicly available data with chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments to get a more comprehensive picture of Bari-Jheh molecular effects. We showed that Bari-Jheh was enriched for H3K9me3 in nonstress conditions, and for H3K9me3, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in oxidative stress conditions, which is consistent with expression changes in adjacent genes. We further showed that under oxidative stress conditions, H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 spread to the promoter region of Jheh1 gene. Finally, another insertion of the Bari1 family was associated with increased H3K27me3 in oxidative stress conditions suggesting that Bari1 histone marks are copy-specific. We concluded that besides adding cis-regulatory sequences, Bari-Jheh influences gene expression by affecting the local chromatin state.",

    "abstract": "In most vertebrate neurons, spikes initiate in the axonal initial segment. When recorded in the soma, they have a surprisingly sharp onset, as if sodium (Na) channels opened abruptly. On the basis of multicompartmental models, this phenomenon has been previously attributed to the progressive sharpening of spikes as they backpropagate from the initiation site to the soma. Here we show in the same models that the biophysical basis of the phenomenon is not backpropagation but critical resistive coupling between the soma and the initial segment. Accordingly, spike initiation results from the interplay between Na current and axial resistive current flowing from axonal initiation site to soma, rather than between local Na and potassium transmembrane currents at the initiation site. The sharp onset of somatic spikes is therefore not an artifact of recording spikes at the incorrect location, but rather the signature that spike initiation does not follow the standard account.",

Peak calling is one of the first steps in analysis of these data. Peak-calling consists of two sub-problems: identifying candidate peaks and testing candidate peaks for statistical significance. We surveyed 30 methods and identified 12 features of the two sub-problems that distinguish methods from each other. We picked six methods (GEM, MACS2, MUSIC, BCP, TM and ZINBA) that span this feature space and used a combination of 300 simulated ChIP-seq data sets, 3 real data sets and mathematical analyses to identify features of methods that allow some to perform better than others. We prove that methods that explicitly combine the signals from ChIP and input samples are less powerful than methods that do not. Methods that use windows of different sizes are more powerful than ones that do not. For statistical testing of candidate peaks, methods that use a Poisson test to rank their candidate peaks are more powerful than those that use a Binomial test. BCP and MACS2 have the best operating characteristics on simulated transcription factor binding data. GEM has the highest fraction of the top 500 peaks containing the binding motif of the immunoprecipitated factor, with 50% of its peaks within 10 base pairs (bp) of a motif. BCP and MUSIC perform best on histone data. These findings provide guidance and rationale for selecting the best peak caller for a given application.",

Unfortunately, there has been limited success in understanding MYCN functionality in the landscape of neuroblastoma and more importantly given that MYCN has been deemed \\\"undruggable,\\\" the need to potentially illuminate key opportunities that indirectly target MYCN is of great interest. To this end, this work employs an emerging quantitative technique from network science, namely network curvature, to quantify the biological robustness of MYCN and its surrounding neighborhood. In particular, when amplified in Stage IV cancer, MYCN exhibits higher curvature (more robust) than those samples with under expressed MYCN levels. When examining the surrounding neighborhood, the above argument still holds for network curvature, but is lost when only analyzing differential expression - a common technique amongst oncologists and computational/molecular biologists. This finding points to the problem (and possible solution) of drug targeting in the context ofcomplexity and indirect cell signaling affects that have often been obfuscated through traditional techniques.",

We corroborate the monophyly of Rossella and provide evidence supporting the existence of one species, namely Rossella antarctica Carter, 1872 and a species flock including specimens determined as Rossella racovitzae Topsent, 1901, Rossella nuda Topsent, 1901, Rossella fibulata Schulze & Kirkpatrick, 1910, and Rossella levis (Kirkpatrick, 1907).",

    "abstract": "Hexactinellida (glass sponges) are abundant and important components of Antarctic benthic communities. However, the relationships and systematics within the common genus Rossella Carter, 1872 (Lyssacinosida: Rossellidae) are unclear and in need of revision. The species content of this genus has changed dramatically over the years depending on the criteria used by the taxonomic authority consulted. Rossella was formerly regarded as a putatively monophyletic group distributed in the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic.

    "abstract": "Large-scale data collection and processing have facilitated scientific discoveries in fields such as genomics and imaging, but cross-investigations between multiple big datasets remain impractical. Computational requirements of high-dimensional association studies are often too demanding for individual sites. Additionally, the sheer size of intermediate results is unfit for collaborative settings where summary statistics are exchanged for meta-analyses. Here we introduce the HASE framework to perform high-dimensional association studies with dramatic reduction in both computational burden and storage requirements of intermediate results. We implemented a novel meta-analytical method that yields identical power as pooled analyses without the need of sharing individual participant data. The efficiency of the framework is illustrated by associating 9 million genetic variants with 1.5 million brain imaging voxels in three cohorts (total N=4,034) followed by meta-analysis, on a standard computational infrastructure. These experiments indicate that HASE facilitates high-dimensional association studies enabling large multicenter association studies for future discoveries.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in molecular simulations is to describe denaturant-dependent folding of proteins order to make direct comparisons with in vitro experiments. We use the molecular transfer model (MTM), which is currently the only method that accomplishes this goal albeit phenomenologically, to quantitatively describe urea-dependent folding of PDZ domain, which plays a significant role in molecular recognition and signaling. Experiments show that urea-dependent unfolding rates of the PDZ2 domain exhibit a downward curvature at high urea concentrations ([C]s), which has been interpreted by invoking the presence of a sparsely populated high energy intermediate. Simulations using the MTM and a coarse-grained Self-Organized Polymer (SOP) representation of PDZ2 are used to show that the intermediate (IEQ), which has some native-like character, is present in equilibrium both in the presence and absence of urea. The free energy profiles as a function of the structural overlap order parameter show that there are two barriers separating the folded and unfolded states. Structures of the transition state ensembles, (TSE1 separating the unfolded and IEQ and TSE2 separating IEQ and the native state), determined using the Pfold method, show that TSE1 is greatly expanded while TSE2 is compact and native-like. Folding trajectories reveal that PDZ2 folds by parallel routes. In one pathway folding occurs exclusively through I1, which resembles IEQ. In a fraction of trajectories, constituting the second pathway, folding occurs through a combination of I1 and a kinetic intermediate. We establish that the radius of gyration ([Formula]) of the unfolded state is more compact (by [~] 9%) under native conditions. Theory and simulations show that the decrease in [Formula] occurs on the time scale on the order of utmost ~ 20 {beta}. The modest decrease in [Formula] and the rapid collapse suggest that high spatial and temporal resolution, currently beyond the scope of most small angle X-ray scattering experiments, are needed to detect compaction in finite-sized proteins. The present work further establishes that MTM is efficacious in producing nearly quantitative predictions for folding of proteins under conditions used to carry out experiments.",

    "abstract": "The frontopolar cortex (FPC), the most anterior part of the lateral prefrontal cortex corresponding to Brodmanns area 10, is involved in human high-order cognition, including reasoning, problem-solving and multitasking. Its specific contribution to prefrontal executive function, however, remains unclear. A neurocomputational model suggests that the FPC implements a basic process referred to as cognitive branching that maintains a task in a pending state during the execution of another, and enables to revert back to it upon completion of the ongoing one. However, the FPC is engaged in other cognitive functions including prospective memory, relational reasoning, episodic memory retrieval and attentional set-shifting, which are not directly linked to the notion of cognitive branching. Here we used a neurocomputional branching model to simulate the involvement of the FPC in these various cognitive functions. Simulation results indicate that the model accounts for the variety of FPC activations observed in these various experimental paradigms. Thus, the present study provides theoretical evidence suggesting that all these behavioral paradigms implicitly involve branching processes, and supports the idea that cognitive branching is the core function of the human frontopolar cortex.",
