    "abstract": "Despite the central role of alternative sigma factors in bacterial stress response and virulence their regulation remains incompletely understood. Here we investigate one of the best-studied examples of alternative sigma factors: the {sigma}B network that controls the general stress response of Bacillus subtilis to uncover widely relevant general design principles that describe the structure-function relationship of alternative sigma factor regulatory networks. We show that the relative stoichiometry of the synthesis rates of {sigma}B, its anti-sigma factor RsbW and the anti-anti-sigma factor RsbV plays a critical role in shaping the network behavior by forcing the {sigma}B network to function as an ultrasensitive negative feedback loop. We further demonstrate how this negative feedback regulation insulates alternative sigma factor activity from competition with the housekeeping sigma factor for RNA polymerase and allows multiple stress sigma factors to function simultaneously with little competitive interference.\\n\\nMajor Subject Areas: Computational and systems biology, Microbiology & Infectious disease\\n\\nResearch Organism: Bacillus subtilis",

    "abstract": "If improvements are to be made in tuberculosis (TB) treatment, an increased understanding of disease in the lung is needed. Studies have shown that bacteria in a less metabolically active state, associated with the presence of lipid bodies, are less susceptible to antibiotics, and recent results have highlighted the disparity in concentration of different compounds into lesions. Treatment success therefore depends critically on the responses of the individual bacteria that constitute the infection.\\n\\nWe propose a hybrid, individual-based approach that analyses spatio-temporal dynamics at the cellular level, linking the behaviour of individual bacteria and host cells with the macroscopic behaviour of the microenvironment. The individual elements (bacteria, macrophages and T cells) are modelled using cellular automaton (CA) rules, and the evolution of oxygen, drugs and chemokine dynamics are incorporated in order to study the effects of the microenvironment in the pathological lesion. We allow bacteria to switch states depending on oxygen concentration, which affects how they respond to treatment. This is the first multiscale model of its type to consider both oxygen-driven phenotypic switching of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis and antibiotic treatment. Using this model, we investigate the role of bacterial cell state and of initial bacterial location on treatment outcome. We demonstrate that when bacteria are located further away from blood vessels, less favourable outcomes are more likely, i.e. longer time before infection is contained/cleared, treatment failure or later relapse. We also show that in cases where bacteria remain at the end of simulations, the organisms tend to be slower-growing and are often located within granulomas, surrounded by caseous material.",

    "abstract": "Neuromodulators shape neural circuit dynamics. Combining electron microscopy, genetics, transcriptome profiling, calcium imaging, and optogenetics, we discovered a peptidergic neuron that modulates C. elegans motor circuit dynamics. The Six/SO-family homeobox transcription factor UNC-39 governs lineage-specific neurogenesis to give rise to a neuron RID. RID bears the anatomic hallmarks of a specialized endocrine neuron: it harbors near-exclusive dense core vesicles that cluster periodically along the axon, and expresses multiple neuropeptides, including the FMRF-amide-related FLP-14. RID activity increases during forward movement. Ablating RID reduces the sustainability of forward movement, a phenotype partially recapitulated by removing FLP-14. Optogenetic depolarization of RID prolongs forward movement, an effect reduced in the absence of FLP-14. Together, these results establish the role of a neuroendocrine cell RID in sustaining a specific behavioral state in C. elegans.",

Which aspects of behavior change upon metabolic challenges and how these allow the animal to achieve nutrient homeostasis is poorly understood. We used an automated video tracking setup to characterize how amino acid and reproductive states interact to shape exploitation and exploration decisions taken by adult Drosophila melanogaster, to achieve nutritional homeostasis. We find that these two states have specific effects on the decisions to engage and leave proteinaceous food patches. Furthermore, the internal nutrient state defines the exploration-exploitation trade-off: nutrient deprived flies focus on specific patches while satiated flies explore more globally. Finally, we show that olfaction mediates the efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate protein source and that octopamine is specifically required to mediate homeostatic postmating responses without affecting internal nutrient sensing. Internal states therefore modulate specific aspects of exploitation and exploration to change nutrient selection.",

    "abstract": "The evolution and diversification of cell types is a key means by which animal complexity evolves. Recently, hierarchical clustering and phylogenetic methods have been applied to RNA-seq data to infer cell type evolutionary history and homology. A major challenge for interpreting this data is that cell type transcriptomes may not evolve independently due to correlated changes in gene expression. This non-independence can arise for several reasons, such as when different tissues share common regulatory sequences for regulating genes expressed in multiple tissues, i.e. pleiotropic effects of mutations. We develop a model to estimate the level of correlated transcriptome evolution (LCE) and apply it to different datasets. The results reveal pervasive correlated transcriptome evolution among different cell and tissue types. In general, tissues related by morphology or developmental lineage exhibit higher LCE than more distantly related tissues. Analyzing new data collected from bird skin appendages suggests that LCE decreases with the phylogenetic age of tissues compared, with recently evolved tissues exhibiting the highest LCE. Furthermore, we show correlated evolution can alter patterns of hierarchical clustering, causing different tissue types from the same species to cluster together. Using a dataset with sufficient taxon sampling, we performed a gene-wise estimation of LCE, identifying genes that most strongly contribute to the correlated evolution signal. Removing genes with high LCE allows for accurate reconstruction of evolutionary relationships among tissue types. Our study provides a statistical method to measure and account for correlated gene expression evolution when interpreting comparative transcriptome data.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, there has been a remarkable improvement in our understanding of the role of genetic variation in complex human diseases, especially via genome-wide association studies. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly characterized, impending the development of therapeutic interventions. Identifying genetic variants that influence the expression level of a gene, i.e. expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), can help us understand how genetic variants influence traits at the molecular level. While most eQTL studies focus on identifying mean effects on gene expression using linear regression, evidence suggests that genetic variation can impact the entire distribution of the expression level. Indeed, several studies have already investigated higher order associations with a special focus on detecting heteroskedasticity. In this paper, we develop a Quantile Rank-score Based Test (QRBT) to identify eQTLs that are associated with the conditional quantile functions of gene expression. We have applied the proposed QRBT to the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, an international tissue bank for studying the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression in human tissues, and found that the proposed QRBT complements the existing methods, and identifies new eQTLs with heterogeneous effects genome-wideacross different quantile levels. Notably, we show that the eQTLs identified by QRBT but missed by linear regression are more likely to be tissue specific, and also associated with greater enrichment in genome-wide significant SNPs from the GWAS catalog. An R package implementing QRBT is available on our website.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have provided evidence for rapid pathogen genome variation, some of which could potentially affect the course of disease. We have previously detected such variation by comparing isolates infecting the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a single patient during a case of bacterial meningitis.\\n\\nTo determine whether the observed variation repeatedly occurs in cases of disease, we performed whole genome sequencing of paired isolates from blood and CSF of 938 meningitis patients. We also applied the same techniques to 54 paired isolates from the nasopharynx and CSF.\\n\\nUsing a combination of reference-free variant calling approaches we show that no genetic adaptation occurs in the invasive phase of bacterial meningitis for four major pathogen species: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Listeria monocytogenes and Haemophilus influenzae. From nasopharynx to CSF, no adaptation was seen in S. pneumoniae, but in N. meningitidis mutations potentially mediating adaptation to the invasive niche were occasionally observed in the dca gene.\\n\\nThis study therefore shows that the bacteria capable of causing meningitis are already able to do this upon entering the blood, and no further sequence change is necessary to cross the blood-brain barrier. The variation discovered from nasopharyngeal isolates suggest that larger studies comparing carriage and invasion may help determine the likely mechanisms of invasiveness.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe have analysed the entire DNA sequence from bacterial pathogen isolates from cases of meningitis in 938 Dutch adults, focusing on comparing pairs of isolates from the patients blood and their cerebrospinal fluid. Previous research has been on only a single patient, but showed possible signs of adaptation to treatment within the host over the course of a single case of disease.\\n\\nBy sequencing many more such paired samples, and including four different bacterial species, we were able to determine that adaptation of the pathogen does not occur after bloodstream invasion during bacterial meningitis.\\n\\nWe also analysed 54 pairs of isolates from pre- and post-invasive niches from the same patient. In N. meningitidis we found variation in the sequence of one gene which appears to provide bacteria with an advantage after invasion of the bloodstream.\\n\\nOverall, our findings indicate that evolution after invasion in bacterial meningitis is not a major contribution to disease pathogenesis. Future studies should involve more extensive sampling between the carriage and disease niches, or on variation of the host.",

    "abstract": "A central aim, from basic neuroscience to psychiatry, is to resolve how genes control brain circuitry and behavior. This is experimentally hard, since most brain functions and behaviors are controlled by multiple genes. In low throughput, one gene at a time, experiments, it is therefore difficult to delineate the neural circuitry through which these sets of genes express their behavioral effects. The increasing amount of publicly available brain and genetic data offers a rich source that could be mined to address this problem computationally. However, most computational approaches are not tailored to reflect functional synergies in brain circuitry accumulating within sets of genes. Here, we developed an algorithm that fuses gene expression and connectivity data with functional genetic meta data and exploits such cumulative effects to predict neuroanatomical maps for multigenic functions. These maps recapture known functional anatomical annotations from literature and functional MRI data. When applied to meta data from mouse QTLs and human neuropsychiatric databases, our method predicts functional maps underlying behavioral or psychiatric traits. We show that it is possible to predict functional neuroanatomy from mouse and human genetic meta data and provide a discovery tool for high throughput functional exploration of brain anatomy in silico.",

    "abstract": "Natural transformation in the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae occurs when cells become \\\"competent\\\", a state that is induced in response to high extracellular concentrations of a secreted peptide signal called CSP (Competence Stimulating Peptide) encoded by the comC locus. Two main CSP signal types (pherotypes) are known to dominate the pherotype diversity across strains. Using thousands of fully sequenced pneumococcal genomes, we confirm that pneumococcal populations are highly genetically structured and that there is significant variation among diverged populations in pherotype frequencies; most carry only a single pherotype. Moreover, we find that the relative frequencies of the two dominant pherotypes significantly vary within a small range across geographical sites. It has been variously proposed that pherotypes either promote genetic exchange among cells expressing the same pherotype, or conversely that they promote recombination between strains bearing different pherotypes. We distinguish these hypotheses using a bioinformatics approach by estimating recombination frequencies within and between pherotypes across 4,089 full genomes. Despite underlying population structure, we observe extensive recombination between populations; additionally, we found significantly higher rates of genetic exchange between strains expressing different pherotypes than among isolates carrying the same pherotype. Our results indicate that pherotypes do not restrict, and marginally facilitate, recombination between strains. Furthermore, our results suggest that the CSP balanced polymorphism does not causally underlie population differentiation. Therefore, when strains carrying different pherotypes encounter one another during co-colonization, genetic exchange can freely occur.",

    "abstract": "The response properties of neurons to sensory stimuli have been used to identify their receptive fields and functionally map sensory systems. In primary visual cortex, most neurons are selective to a particular orientation and spatial frequency of the visual stimulus. Using two-photon calcium imaging of neuronal populations from the primary visual cortex of mice, we have characterized the response properties of neurons to various orientations and spatial frequencies. Surprisingly, we found that the orientation selectivity of neurons actually depends on the spatial frequency of the stimulus. This dependence can be easily explained if one assumed spatially asymmetric Gabor-type receptive fields. We propose that receptive fields of neurons in layer 2/3 of visual cortex are indeed spatially asymmetric, and that this asymmetry could be used effectively by the visual system to encode natural scenes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIn this manuscript we demonstrate that the orientation selectivity of neurons in primary visual cortex of mouse is highly dependent on the stimulus SF. This dependence is realized quantitatively in a decrease in the selectivity strength of cells in non-optimum SF, and more importantly, it is also evident qualitatively in a shift in the preferred orientation of cells in non-optimum SF. We show that a receptive-field model of a 2D asymmetric Gabor, rather than a symmetric one, can explain this surprising observation. Therefore, we propose that the receptive fields of neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex are spatially asymmetric and this asymmetry could be used effectively by the visual system to encode natural scenes.\\n\\nHighlights- Orientation selectivity is dependent on spatial frequency.\\n- Asymmetric Gabor model can explain this dependence.",

The non-zero variance of [Formula] results from a (weak) correlation between coalescence times even at unlinked loci, which, in turn, is due to the underlying fixed pedigree shared by all genealogies. We derive the correlation coefficient under a diploid, discrete-time, Wright-Fisher model, and we also derive a simple, closed-form lower bound. We also obtain empirical estimates of the correlation of coalescence times under demographic models inspired by large-scale human genealogies. While the effect we de scribe is small [Formula], it is important to recognize this feature of statistical population genetics, which runs counter to commonly held notions about unlinked loci.",

The AP enables melting of the duplex to unmask the PQS to adopt a G-quadruplex fold in which apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) binds, but inefficiently cleaves, the AP for activation of VEGF or NTHL1 genes. This concept allowed identification of 61 human DNA repair genes that might be activated by this mechanism.
