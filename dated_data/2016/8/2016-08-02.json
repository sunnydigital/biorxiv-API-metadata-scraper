    "abstract": "We present the Metagenomic Intra-species Diversity Analysis System (MIDAS), which is an integrated computational pipeline for quantifying bacterial species abundance and strain-level genomic variation, including gene content and single nucleotide polymorphisms, from shotgun metagenomes. Our method leverages a database of >30,000 bacterial reference genomes which we clustered into species groups. These cover the majority of abundant species in the human microbiome but only a small proportion of microbes in other environments, including soil and seawater. We applied MIDAS to stool metagenomes from 98 Swedish mothers and their infants over one year and used rare single nucleotide variants to reveal extensive vertical transmission of strains at birth but colonization with strains unlikely to derive from the mother at later time points. This pattern was missed with species-level analysis, because the infant gut microbiome composition converges towards that of an adult over time. We also applied MIDAS to 198 globally distributed marine metagenomes and used gene content to show that many prevalent bacterial species have population structure that correlates with geographic location. Strain-level genetic variants present in metagenomes clearly reveal extensive structure and dynamics that are obscured when data is analyzed at a higher taxonomic resolution.",

    "abstract": "The balance between proliferation and differentiation in the plant shoot apical meristem is controlled by regulatory loops involving the phytohormone cytokinin and stem cell identity genes. Concurrently, cellular differentiation in the developing shoot is coordinated with the environmental and developmental status of plastids within those cells. Here we employ an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant exhibiting constitutive plastid osmotic stress to investigate the molecular and genetic pathways connecting plastid osmotic stress with cell differentiation at the shoot apex. msl2 msl3 mutants exhibit dramatically enlarged and deformed plastids in the shoot apical meristem, and develop a mass of callus tissue at the shoot apex. Callus production in this mutant requires the cytokinin receptor AHK2 and is characterized by increased cytokinin levels, down-regulation of cytokinin signaling inhibitors ARR7 and ARR15, and induction of the stem cell identity gene WUSCHEL. Furthermore, plastid stress-induced apical callus production requires elevated plastidic ROS, ABA biosynthesis, the retrograde signaling protein GUN1, and ABI4. These results are consistent with a model wherein the cytokinin/WUS pathway and retrograde signaling control cell differentiation at the shoot apex.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTPlastid osmotic stress influences differentiation at the plant shoot apex.

    "abstract": "Developmental gene regulatory networks (dGRNs) are assemblages of interacting regulatory factors that direct ontogeny of animal body plans. The hierarchical topology of these networks predicts that their nodes will evolve at different rates and consequently will bias the trajectories of embryonic evolution. To test this, detailed, comparative analyses of dGRNs that specify early, global embryonic domains are required. The most extensively detailed dGRNs have been documented for one of the two subclasses of extant sea urchins, the euechinoids. Remarkably, euechinoid dGRNs operating in early development show little appreciable change even though they diverged approximately 90 million years ago (mya). Therefore, to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of dGRNs, comparative microdissection must be undertaken for sea urchins that diverged deeper in geological time. Recent studies of cidaroids, the sister clade of euechinoid sea urchins, suggest that comparative analyses of their embryonic domain specification may prove insightful for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of dGRNs. Here, I report the spatiotemporal dynamics of 19 regulatory factors involved in dorsal-ventral patterning of non-skeletogenic mesodermal and ectodermal domains in the early development of Eucidaris tribuloides, a cidaroid sea urchin. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that deployment of ectodermal regulatory factors is more impervious to change than mesodermal regulatory factors in the sea urchin lineage and are supported by multiple lines of experimental evidence. Additionally, endogenous spatiotemporal expression data, intra-class reporter microinjections, and perturbation analyses of Nodal and Notch signaling allow the enumeration of numerous alterations to regulatory factor deployment since the divergence of echinoids. These results provide a global view of early embryonic developmental processes in two clades that diverged at least 268.8 mya and show that the dGRNs controlling embryonic specification exhibit differential lability, supporting the hypothesis that the topologies of dGRNs bias rates of evolutionary change and alter the developmental evolutionary trajectories of embryogenesis.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEarly in the development of an embryo, networks of genes are initiated to differentiate the rapidly dividing cells into distinct territories that will later serve specific functions. Sea urchins have revealed much about how this process unfolds. Recent studies have focused on one of the two modern lineages of sea urchins and have shown that these processes have not appreciably changed over the past 90 million years. I sought to determine if this trend extends over even larger evolutionary distances by investigating similar processes in a sea urchin from the second modern lineage, which is removed by 268 million years of evolution. By revealing where and when these genes are expressed and interfering with common mechanisms of development in a distantly related sea urchin, I show that changes to these networks of genes have occurred at all levels of the network. Additionally, I present data that suggests that changes to these networks of genes occur disproportionately in certain embryonic territories, which may be true for early development for other groups of organisms as well.",

Current diversity in the subcontinent is the result of complex episodes of genetic admixture and cultural contact between the early inhabitants and the migrants that have arrived in the region over the last 2,000 years. Here we analyze 1,856 individuals from 91 populations, comprising novel and available genotype data to characterize the genetic ancestry profiles of 631 individuals from 51 southern African populations. Combining local ancestry and allele frequency analyses we identify a tripartite, ancient, Khoesan-related genetic structure, which correlates with geography, but not with linguistic affiliation or subsistence strategy. The fine mapping of these components in southern African populations reveals admixture dynamics and episodes of cultural reversion involving several Khoesan groups and highlights different mixtures of ancestral components in Bantu speakers and Coloured individuals.",

    "abstract": "Plants are permanently exposed to rapidly changing environments, therefore it is evident that they had to evolve mechanisms enabling them to dynamically adapt to such fluctuations. Here we study how plants can be trained to enhance their photoprotection and elaborate on the concept of the short-term illumination memory in Arabidopsis thaliana. By monitoring fluorescence emission dynamics we systematically observe the extent of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) after previous light exposure to recognise and quantify the memory effect. We propose a simplified mathematical model of photosynthesis that includes the key components required for NPQ activation, which allows us to quantify the contribution to photoprotection by those components. Due to its reduced complexity, our model can be easily applied to study similar behavioural changes in other species, which we demonstrate by adapting it to the shadow-tolerant plant Epipremnum aureum. Our results indicate that a basic mechanism of short-term light memory is preserved. The slow component, accumulation of zeaxanthin, accounts for the amount of memory remaining after relaxation in darkness, while the fast one, antenna protonation, increases quenching efficiency. With our combined theoretical and experimental approach we provide a unifying framework describing common principles of key photoprotective mechanisms across species in general, mathematical terms.",

We compared the performance of the most popular methods against a dated tree of fossil Canidae derived from previously published monographs. Using a canid morphology dataset, we performed tip-dating using Beast 2.1.3 and MrBayes 3.2.5. We find that for key nodes (Canis, ~3.2 Ma, Caninae ~11.7 Ma) a non-mechanistic model using a uniform tree prior produces estimates that are unrealistically old (27.5, 38.9 Ma). Mechanistic models (incorporating lineage birth, death, and sampling rates) estimate ages that are closely in line with prior research. We provide a discussion of these two families of models (mechanistic vs. non-mechanistic) and their applicability to fossil datasets.",

Platinum genotypes are highly concordant with the current catalogue of the National Institute of Standards and Technology for both SNVs (>99.99%) and indels (99.92%), and add a validated truth catalogue that has 26% more SNVs and 45% more indels. Analysis of 334,652 SNVs that were consistent between informatics pipelines yet inconsistent with haplotype transmission (\\\"non-platinum\\\") revealed that the majority of these variants are de novo and cell-line mutations or reside within previously unidentified duplications and deletions.

Microdeletions involving the region downstream the gene have been also associated to speech and cognitive deficits. We recently described a girl harbouring a complex chromosomal rearrangement with one breakpoint downstream the gene that might affect her speech and cognitive abilities via physical separation of distant regulatory DNA elements. In this study, we have used highly efficient targeted chromosomal deletions induced by the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool to demonstrate the functionality of two enhancers, FOXP2-Eproximal and FOXP2-Edistal, located in the intergenic region between FOXP2 and its adjacent MDFIC gene. Deletion of any of these two functional enhancers in the neuroblastomic cell line SK-N-MC downregulates FOXP2 and decreases FOXP2 protein levels, conversely it upregulates MDFIC and increases MDFIC protein levels. This suggests that both regulatory elements may be shared between FOXP2 and MDFIC. We expect these findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how FOXP2 and MDFIC are regulated to pace neuronal development supporting speech and language.",

Recent promising studies emphasize the significance of dynamics data to selectively target its active/inactive states. However, despite tremendous information on K-Ras, the direction of information flow in the allosteric regulation of its dynamics has not yet been elucidated. Here, we present a novel approach that identifies causality in correlated motions of proteins and apply it to K-Ras dynamics. Specifically, we analyze molecular dynamics simulations data and comprehensively investigate nucleotide-dependent intrinsic K-Ras activity. We show that GTP binding leads to characteristic residue correlations with relatively long decay times by stabilizing K-Ras motions. Furthermore, we identify for the first time driver-follower relationships of correlated motions in the regulation of K-Ras activity. Our results can be utilized for directly targeting mutant K-Ras in future studies.",

We model glycolytic acid production as a public good for all tumour cells and oxygen from vascularization via VEGF production as a club good benefiting non-glycolytic tumour cells. This results in three viable phenotypic strategies: glycolytic, angiogenic, and aerobic non-angiogenic.\\n\\nResultsWe classify the dynamics into three qualitatively distinct regimes: (1) fully glycolytic, (2) fully angiogenic, or (3) polyclonal in all three cell types. The third regime allows for dynamic heterogeneity even with linear goods, something that was not possible in prior public good models that considered glycolysis or growth-factor production in isolation.\\n\\nConclusionThe cyclic dynamics of the polyclonal regime stress the importance of timing for antiglycolysis treatments like lonidamine.

Knowledge of the functional effects of mutations to HIV is critical for understanding this evolution. HIVs most rapidly evolving protein is its envelope (Env). Here we use deep mutational scanning to experimentally estimate the effects of all amino-acid mutations to Env on viral replication in cell culture. Most mutations are under purifying selection in our experiments, although a few sites experience strong selection for mutations that enhance HIVs growth in cell culture. We compare our experimental measurements of each sites preference for each amino acid to the actual frequencies of these amino acids in naturally occurring HIV sequences. Our measured amino-acid preferences correlate with amino-acid frequencies in natural sequences for most sites. However, our measured preferences are less concordant with natural amino-acid frequencies at surface-exposed sites that are subject to pressures absent from our experiments such as antibody selection. We show that some regions of Env have a high inherent tolerance to mutation, whereas other regions (such as epitopes of broadly neutralizing antibodies) have a significantly reduced capacity to tolerate mutations. Overall, our results help disentangle the role of inherent functional constraints and external selection pressures in shaping Envs evolution.",

    "abstract": "Recent reports suggested that NF-Y transcription factors are positive regulators of skotomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Three NF-YC genes (NF-YC3, NF-YC4, and NF-YC9) are known to have overlapping functions in photoperiod dependent flowering and previous studies demonstrated that they interact with basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. This included ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), which has well-demonstrated roles in photomorphogenesis. Similar to hy5 mutants, we report that nf-yc3 nf-yc4 nf-yc9 triple mutants failed to inhibit hypocotyl elongation in all tested light wavelengths. Surprisingly, nf-yc3 nf-yc4 nf-yc9 hy5 mutants had synergistic defects in light perception, suggesting that NF-Ys represent a parallel light signaling pathway. As with other photomorphogenic transcription factors, nf-yc3 nf-yc4 nf-yc9 triple mutants also partially suppress the short hypocotyl and dwarf rosette phenotypes of CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (cop1) mutants. Thus, our data strongly suggest that NF-Y transcription factors have important roles as positive regulators of photomorphogenesis, and in conjunction with other recent reports implies that the NF-Y are multifaceted regulators of early seedling development.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryLight perception is critically important for the fitness of plants in both natural and agricultural settings. Plants not only use light for photosynthesis, but also as a cue for proper development. As a seedling emerges from soil it must determine the light environment and adopt an appropriate growth habit. When blue and red wavelengths are the dominant sources of light, plants will undergo photomorphogenesis. Photomorphogenesis describes a number of developmental responses initiated by light in a seedling, and includes shortened stems and establishing the ability to photosynthesize. The genes regulating photomorphogenesis have been studied extensively, but a complete picture remains elusive. Here we describe the finding that NUCLEAR FACTOR-Y (NF-Y) genes are positive regulators of photomorphogenesis - i.e., in plants where NF-Y genes are mutated, they display some characteristics of dark grown plants, even though they are in the light. Our data suggests that the roles of NF-Y genes in light perception do not fit in easily with those of other described pathways. Thus, studying these genes promises to help develop a more complete picture of how light drives plant development.",

Our results demonstrate that multiple technologies are still necessary for complete genomic representation, particularly in regions of highly identical segmental duplications. Additionally, we show that diploid assembly has utility in improving the quality of de novo human genome assemblies.",

    "abstract": "The Nose-Hoover (NH) equation of motion is widely used in molecular dynamics simulations. It enables us to set a constant temperature and produce the canonical distribution for a target physical system. For the purpose of investigating the physical system under fluctuating temperature, we have introduced a coupled Nose-Hoover equation in our previous work [J. Phys. A 48 455001 (2015)]. The coupled NH equation implements a fluctuating heat-bath temperature in the NH equation of the physical system, and also keeps a statistically complete description via an invariant measure of the total system composed of the physical system and a \\\"temperature system\\\". However, a difficulty lies in that the time development of the physical system may not correspond to the realistic physical process, because of the need of a scaled time average to compute thermodynamical quantities. The current work gives a solution by presenting a new scheme, which is free from the scaled time but retains the statistical description. By use of simple model systems, we validate the current scheme and compare with the original scheme. The sampling property of the current scheme is also clarified to investigate the effect of function setting used for the distribution of the total system.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus plays a key role in pattern separation, the process of transforming similar incoming information to highly dissimilar, non-overlapping representations. Sparse firing granule cells (GCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) have been proposed to undertake this computation, but little is known about which of their properties influence pattern separation. Dendritic atrophy has been reported in diseases associated with pattern separation deficits, suggesting a possible role for dendrites in this phenomenon. To investigate whether and how the dendrites of GCs contribute to pattern separation, we build a simplified, biologically relevant, computational model of the DG. Our model suggests that the presence of GC dendrites is associated with high pattern separation efficiency while their atrophy leads to increased excitability and performance impairments. These impairments can be rescued by restoring GC sparsity to control levels through various manipulations. We predict that dendrites contribute to pattern separation as a mechanism for controlling sparsity.",

We employed flux balance analysis to demonstrate that the network is capable of producing biomass (amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, cell wall) in experimentally observed proportions, during day and night. By connecting the plant model to a model of its rhizobial symbiont, Sinorhizobium meliloti, we were able to investigate the effects of the symbiosis on metabolic fluxes and plant growth and could demonstrate how oxygen availability influences metabolic exchanges between plant and symbiont, thus elucidating potential benefits of amino acid cycling. We thus provide a modelling framework, in which the interlinked metabolism of plants and nodules can be studied from a theoretical perspective.",

    "abstract": "The coral symbiosis is the linchpin of the reef ecosystem, yet the mechanisms that promote and maintain cooperation between hosts and symbionts have not been fully resolved. We used a phylogenetically controlled design to investigate the role of vertical symbiont transmission, an evolutionary mechanism in which symbionts are inherited directly from parents, predicted to enhance cooperation and holobiont fitness. Six species of coral, three vertical transmitters and their closest horizontally transmitting relatives, which exhibit environmental acquisition of symbionts, were fragmented and subjected to a two-week thermal stress experiment. Symbiont cell density, photosynthetic function and translocation of photosynthetically fixed carbon between symbionts and hosts were quantified to assess changes in physiological performance and cooperation. All species exhibited similar decreases in symbiont cell density and net photosynthesis in response to elevated temperature, consistent with the onset of bleaching. Yet baseline cooperation, i.e. translocation of photosynthate, in ambient conditions and the reduction in cooperation in response to elevated temperature differed among species. Although Porites lobata and Galaxea acrhelia did exhibit the highest levels of baseline cooperation, we did not observe universally higher levels of cooperation in vertically transmitting species. Post hoc sequencing of the Symbiodinium ITS-2 locus was used to investigate the potential role of differences in symbiont community composition. Interestingly, reductions in cooperation at the onset of bleaching tended to be associated with increased symbiont community diversity among coral species. The theoretical benefits of evolving vertical transmission are based on the underlying assumption that the host-symbiont relationship becomes genetically uniform, thereby reducing competition among symbionts. Taken together, our results suggest that it may not be vertical transmission per se that influences host-symbiont cooperation, but genetic uniformity of the symbiont community, although additional work is needed to test this hypothesis.",

Simulated atmospheric N deposition is associated with reduced fungal biomass, shifts in fungal community structure, slowed litter decay, and soil C accumulation. Although rarely studied, N deposition may also result in novel selective pressures on fungi, affecting evolutionary trajectories. To directly test if long-term N enrichment reshapes fungal behaviors, we isolated decomposer fungi from a longterm (28 year) N addition experiment and used a common garden approach to compare growth rates and decay abilities of isolates from control and N amended plots. Both growth and decay were significantly altered by long-term exposure to N enrichment. Changes in growth rates were idiosyncratic, but litter decay by N isolates was generally lower compared to control isolates of the same species, a response not readily reversed when N isolates were grown in control (low N) environments. Changes in fungal behaviors accompany and perhaps drive previously observed N-induced shifts in fungal diversity, community composition, and litter decay dynamics.",

One solution is to decrease the cost and time to assemble novel genomes by leveraging \\\"hybrid\\\" assemblies that use long reads for scaffolding and short reads for accuracy. To this end, we describe a novel application of a multi-string Burrows-Wheeler Transform with auxiliary FM-index to correct errors in long read sequences using a set of complementary short reads.

Single locus DNA markers can be applied to facilitate the process of selection as they are species specific, reliable, reproducible and easy to use. This study set forth to develop a library of single locus DNA markers for two commercially cultured species of groupers, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus and E. corallicola. DNA was isolated from one representative specimen of each species and utilized to construct shotgun genomic libraries. DNA sequences derived from the library were selected for the development of 42 and 41 single locus DNA markers for E. fuscoguttatus and E. corallicola respectively. The markers were then tested against randomly selected specimens obtained from the wild. Genotyping results revealed that the species specific primers demonstrated the ability to distinguish between individuals from the same species into distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) on the basis of their differential DNA profiles, thus establishing a basis for selection based on genetic heterogeneity. The findings of this study present a strong case for the application of single locus DNA markers as molecular tools for the selection of broodstock on the basis of genotyping.",

However, existing approaches make simplifications or assumptions that are easily violated when investigating sequence variation within a metagenome.\\n\\nWe propose the metahaplome as the set of haplotypes for any particular genomic region of interest within a metagenomic data set and present Hansel and Gretel, a data structure and algorithm that together provide a proof of concept framework for the recovery of true haplotypes from a metagenomic data set. The algorithm performs incremental haplotype recovery, using smoothed Naive Bayes -- a simple, efficient and effective method.\\n\\nHansel and Gretel pose several advantages over existing solutions: the framework is capable of recovering haplotypes from metagenomes, does not require a priori knowledge about the input data, makes no assumptions regarding the distribution of alleles at variant sites, is robust to error, and uses all available evidence from aligned reads, without altering or discarding observed variation. We evaluate our approach using synthetic metahaplomes constructed from sets of real genes and show that up to 99% of SNPs on a haplotype can be correctly recovered from short reads that originate from a metagenomic data set.",

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heritable cardiovascular disorder that affects 1 in 500 people. In infants it can be particularly severe and it is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in pediatric populations. A high percentage of HCM is attributed to mutations in {beta}-cardiac myosin, the motor protein that powers ventricular contraction. This study reports how two mutations that cause early-onset HCM, D239N and H251N, affect the mechanical output of human {beta}-cardiac myosin at the molecular level. We observe extremely large increases (25% - 95%) in the actin gliding velocity, single molecule intrinsic force, and ATPase activity of the two mutant myosin motors compared to wild type myosin. In contrast to previous studies of HCM-causing mutations in human {beta}-cardiac myosin, these mutations were striking in that they caused changes in biomechanical parameters that were both greater in magnitude and more uniformly consistent with a hyper-contractile phenotype. In addition, S1-S2 binding studies revealed a significant decrease in affinity of the H251N motor for S2, suggesting that this mutation may further increase hyper-contractility by releasing active motors from a sequestered state. This report shows, for the first time, a clear and significant gain in function for all tested molecular biomechanical parameters due to HCM mutations in human {beta}-cardiac myosin.",

Here, we analyzed the molecular persistence of serological immunity by an examination of BM PC immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IGH) transcripts derived from serial bone marrow specimens obtained during a span of several years. Using high-throughput sequence analysis of the same individual for 6.5 years, we show that the BM PC repertoire is remarkably stable over time. We find that the bias in IGH V, D, and J individual gene usage and also the combinatorial V-D, V-J, D-J, and V-D-J usage across time to be nearly static. When compared to a second donor with time points 2 years apart, these overall patterns are preserved, and surprisingly, we find high correlation of gene usage between the two donors. Lastly, we report the persistence of numerous BM PC clonal clusters (~2%) identifiable across 6.5 years at all time points assayed, supporting a model of serological memory based, at least in part, upon intrinsic longevity of human PCs. We anticipate that this longitudinal study will facilitate the ability to differentiate between healthy and diseased antibody repertoire states, by serving as a point of comparison with future deep-sequencing studies involving immune intervention.",

    "abstract": "The amphipod crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis is a blossoming model system for studies of developmental mechanisms and more recently regeneration. We have sequenced the genome allowing annotation of all key signaling pathways, transcription factors, and non-coding RNAs that will enhance ongoing functional studies. Parhyale is a member of the Malacostraca clade, which includes crustacean food crop species. We analysed the immunity related genes of Parhyale as an important comparative system for these species, where immunity related aquaculture problems have increased as farming has intensified. We also find that Parhyale and other species within Multicrustacea contain the enzyme sets necessary to perform lignocellulose digestion (\\\"wood eating\\\"), suggesting this ability may predate the diversification of this lineage. Our data provide an essential resource for further development of Parhyale as an experimental model. The first malacostracan genome will underpin ongoing comparative work in food crop species and research investigating lignocellulose as an energy source.",
