    "abstract": "Coral reefs are increasingly threatened by global and local anthropogenic stressors such as rising seawater temperature, nutrient enrichment, sedimentation, and overfishing. Although many studies have investigated the impacts of local and global stressors on coral reefs, we still do not fully understand how these stressors influence coral community structure, particularly across environmental gradients on a reef system. Here, we investigate coral community composition across three different temperature and productivity regimes along a nearshore-offshore gradient on lagoonal reefs of the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS). A novel metric was developed using ultra-high-resolution satellite-derived estimates of sea surface temperatures (SST) to classify reefs as exposed to low (lowTP), moderate (modTP), or high (highTP) temperature parameters over 10 years (2003 to 2012). Coral species richness, abundance, diversity, density, and percent cover were lower at highTP sites relative to lowTP and modTP sites, but these coral community traits did not differ significantly between lowTP and modTP sites. Analysis of coral life history strategies revealed that highTP sites were dominated by hardy stress tolerant and fast-growing weedy coral species, while lowTP and modTP sites consisted of competitive, generalist, weedy, and stress-tolerant coral species. Satellite-derived estimates of Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) were obtained for 13-years (2003-2015) as a proxy for primary production. Chl-a concentrations were highest at highTP sites, medial at modTP sites, and lowest at lowTP sites. Notably, thermal parameters correlated better with coral community traits between site types than productivity, suggesting that temperature (specifically number of days above the thermal bleaching threshold) played a greater role in defining coral community structure than productivity on the MBRS. Dominance of weedy and stress-tolerant genera at highTP sites suggests that corals utilizing these two life history strategies may be better suited to cope with warmer oceans and thus may warrant protective status under climate change.",

    "abstract": "CD44 transmembrane glycoprotein is involved in angiogenesis, but it is not clear whether CD44 functions as a pro- or antiangiogenic molecule. Here, we assess the role of CD44 in angiogenesis and endothelial proliferation by using Cd44-null mice and CD44 silencing in human endothelial cells. We demonstrate that angiogenesis is increased in Cd44-null mice compared to either wild-type or heterozygous animals. Silencing of CD44 expression in cultured endothelial cells results in their augmented proliferation and viability. The growth-suppressive effect of CD44 is mediated by its extracellular domain and is independent of its hyaluronan binding function. CD44-mediated effect on cell proliferation is independent of specific angiogenic growth factor stimulation. These results show that CD44 expression on endothelial cells constrains endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Thus, endothelial CD44 might serve as a therapeutic target both in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, where endothelial protection is desired, as well as in cancer treatment, due to its antiangiogenic properties.",

    "abstract": "O_LIA crucial step in the use of DNA markers for biodiversity surveys is the assignment of Linnaean taxonomies (species, genus, etc.) to sequence reads. This allows the use of all the information known based on the taxonomic names. Taxonomic placement of DNA barcoding sequences is inherently probabilistic because DNA sequences contain errors, because there is natural variation among sequences within a species, and because reference databases are incomplete and can have false annotations. However, most existing bioinformatics methods for taxonomic placement either exclude uncertainty, or quantify it using metrics other than probability.\\nC_LIO_LIIn this paper we evaluate the performance of a recently proposed probabilistic taxonomic placement method PROTAX by applying it to both annotated reference sequence data as well as unknown environmental data. Our four case studies include contrasting taxonomic groups (fungi, bacteria, mammals, and insects), variation in the length and quality of the barcoding sequences (from individually Sanger-sequenced sequences to short Illumina reads), variation in the structures and sizes of the taxonomies (from 800 to 130 000 species), and variation in the completeness of the reference databases (representing 15% to 100% of the species).\\nC_LIO_LIOur results demonstrate that PROTAX yields essentially unbiased assessment of probabilities of taxonomic placement, and thus that its quantification of species identification uncertainty is reliable. As expected, the accuracy of taxonomic placement increases with increasing coverage of taxonomic and reference sequence databases, and with increasing ratio of genetic variation among taxonomic levels over within taxonomic levels.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results show that reliable species-level identification from environmental samples is still challenging, and thus neglecting identification uncertainty can lead to spurious inference. A key aim for future research is the completion and pruning of taxonomic and reference sequence databases, and making these two types of data compatible.\\nC_LI",

Participants were assessed for clinically diagnosed MCI/Dementia and psychometric test-based MCI (MCI-TB) at 12 years of follow-up. Multi-state models estimated the odds of transitioning from cognitively normal (CN) to MCI/Dementia and MCI-TB over 12 years according to baseline ANU-ADRI and GRS.\\n\\nRESULTSHigher ANU-ADRI score predicted transitioning from CN to either MCI/Dementia and MCI-TB (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.06, 95% CI:1.04-1.09; HR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.03-1.09), and a reduced likelihood of cognitive recovery from MCITB to CN (HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.49-0.98).

We consulted mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD) research detailing the use of risk factors for predicting progression from MCI and AD; and the appropriate statistical models for modelling transitions between cognitive states. These publications are appropriately cited.\\n\\nInterpretationIn the general population, the ANU-ADRI comprising lifestyle, medical and demographic factors is predictive of progression from normal cognition to MCI/Dementia whereas a Genetic Risk Score comprising the main Alzheimers risk genes is not predictive.\\n\\nFuture DirectionsFurther evaluation of the ANU-ADRI as a predictor of specific MCI and dementia subtypes is required. The ANU-ADRI may be used to identify individuals indicated for risk reduction intervention and to assist clinical management and cognitive health promotion. Genetic risk scores contribute to understanding dementia etiology but apart from APOE are unlikely to be useful in screening or prevention trials.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in cancer treatment is predicting the clinical response to anti-cancer drugs for each individual patient. For complex diseases such as cancer, characterized by high inter-patient variance, the implementation of precision medicine approaches is dependent upon understanding the pathological processes at the molecular level. While the \\\"omics\\\" era provides unique opportunities to dissect the molecular features of diseases, the ability to utilize it in targeted therapeutic efforts is hindered by both the massive size and diverse nature of the \\\"omics\\\" data. Recent advances with Deep Learning Neural Networks (DLNNs), suggests that DLNN could be trained on large data sets to efficiently predict therapeutic responses in cancer treatment. We present the application of Association Rule Mining combined with DLNNs for the analysis of high-throughput molecular profiles of 1001 cancer cell lines, in order to extract cancer-specific signatures in the form of easily interpretable rules and use these rules as input to predict pharmacological responses to a large number of anti-cancer drugs. The proposed algorithm outperformed Random Forests (RF) and Bayesian Multitask Multiple Kernel Learning (BMMKL) classification which currently represent the state-of-the-art in drug-response prediction. Moreover, the in silico pipeline presented, introduces a novel strategy for identifying potential therapeutic targets, as well as possible drug combinations with high therapeutic potential. For the first time, we demonstrate that DLNNs trained on a large pharmacogenomics data-set can effectively predict the therapeutic response of specific drugs in different cancer types. These findings serve as a proof of concept for the application of DLNNs to predict therapeutic responsiveness, a milestone in precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Determining the genome sequence of an organism is challenging, yet fundamental to understanding its biology. Over the past decade, thousands of human genomes have been sequenced, contributing deeply to biomedical research. In the vast majority of cases, these have been analyzed by aligning sequence reads to a single reference genome, biasing the resulting analyses and, in general, failing to capture sequences novel to a given genome.\\n\\nSome de novo assemblies have been constructed, free of reference bias, but nearly all were constructed by merging homologous loci into single  consensus sequences, generally absent from nature. These assemblies do not correctly represent the diploid biology of an individual. In exactly two cases, true diploid de novo assemblies have been made, at great expense. One was generated using Sanger sequencing and one using thousands of clone pools.\\n\\nHere we demonstrate a straightforward and low-cost method for creating true diploid de novo assemblies. We make a single library from ~1 ng of high molecular weight DNA, using the 10x Genomics microfluidic platform to partition the genome. We applied this technique to seven human samples, generating low-cost HiSeq X data, then assembled these using a new  pushbutton algorithm, Supernova. Each computation took two days on a single server. Each yielded contigs longer than 100 kb, phase blocks longer than 2.5 Mb, and scaffolds longer than 15 Mb. Our method provides a scalable capability for determining the actual diploid genome sequence in a sample, opening the door to new approaches in genomic biology and medicine.",

    "abstract": "Genetic factors make a substantial contribution to inter-individual variability in cognitive function. A recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identified two loci, AKAP6 and MIR2113 that are associated with general cognitive function. Here, we extend this previous research by investigating the association of MIR2113 and AKAP6 with baseline and longitudinal nonlinear change across a broad spectrum of cognitive domains in community-based cohort of 1,570 older adults without dementia. Two SNPs, MIR211-rs10457441 and AKAP6-rs17522122 were genotyped in 1,570 non-demented older Australians of European ancestry, who were examined up to 4 times over 12 years. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine the association between AKAP6 and MIR2113 with cognitive performance in episodic memory, working memory, vocabulary, perceptual speed and reaction time at baseline and with linear and quadratic rates of change. AKAP6-rs17522122*T was associated with worse baseline performance in episodic memory, working memory, vocabulary and perceptual speed, but it was not associated with cognitive change in any domain. MIR2113-rs10457441*T was associated with accelerated decline in episodic memory. No other associations with baseline cognitive performance or with linear or quadratic rate or cognitive changes was observed for this SNP. These results confirm the previous finding that, AKAP6 is associated with performance across multiple cognitive domains at baseline but not with cognitive decline, while MIR2113 primarily affects the rate at which memory declines over time.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYLateral gene transfer can precipitate rapid evolutionary change. In 2010 the global pandemic of kiwifruit canker disease caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) reached New Zealand. At the time of introduction, the single clone responsible for the outbreak was sensitive to copper, however, analysis of a sample of isolates taken in 2015 and 2016 showed that a quarter were copper resistant. Genome sequences of seven strains showed that copper resistance - comprising czc/cusABC and copABCD systems - along with resistance to arsenic and cadmium, was acquired via uptake of integrative conjugative elements (ICEs), but also plasmids. Comparative analysis showed ICEs to have a mosaic structure, with one being a tripartite arrangement of two different ICEs and a plasmid that were isolated in 1921 (USA), 1968 (NZ) and 1988 (Japan), from P. syringae pathogens of millet, wheat and kiwifruit, respectively. Two of the Psa ICEs were nearly identical to two ICEs isolated from kiwifruit leaf colonists prior to the introduction of Psa into NZ. Additionally, we show ICE transfer in vitro and in planta, analyze fitness consequences of ICE carriage, capture the de novo formation of novel recombinant ICEs, and explore ICE host-range.\\n\\nORIGINALITY-SIGNIFICANT STATEMENTLateral gene transfer is a major evolutionary force, but its immediacy is often overlooked. Between 2008 and 2010 a single virulent clone of the kiwifruit pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae spread to kiwifruit growing regions of the world. After arrival in New Zealand it acquired genetic determinants of copper resistance in the form of integrative conjugative elements and plasmids. Components of these elements are evident in distantly related bacteria from millet (USA, 1921), kiwifruit (Japan, 1988) and wheat (New Zealand, 1968). Additional laboratory experiments capture evidence of the dynamism underpinning the evolution of these elements in real time and further emphasize the potent role that lateral gene transfer plays in microbial evolution.",

Reward maximization is particularly relevant when the optimal behavior depends on an animals internal judgment of confidence or subjective preferences.

    "abstract": "Conceptual models suggest certain microorganisms (e.g., the red complex) are indicative of a specific disease state (e.g., periodontitis); however, recent studies have questioned the validity of these models. Here, the abundances of 500+ microbial species were determined in 16 patients with clinical signs of one of the following oral conditions: periodontitis, established caries, edentulism, and oral health. Our goal was to determine if the abundances of certain microorganisms reflect dysbiosis or a specific clinical condition that could be used as a signature for dental research. Microbial abundances were determined by the analysis of 138,718 calibrated probes using Gene Meter methodology. Each 16S rRNA gene was targeted by an average of 194 unique probes (n=25 nt). The calibration involved diluting pooled gene target samples, hybridizing each dilution to a DNA microarray, and fitting the probe intensities to adsorption models. The fit of the model to the experimental data was used to assess individual and aggregate probe behavior; good fits (R2>0.90) were retained for back-calculating microbial abundances from patient samples. The abundance of a gene was determined from the median of all calibrated individual probes or from the calibrated abundance of all aggregated probes. With the exception of genes with low abundances (< 2 arbitrary units), the abundances determined by the different calibrations were highly correlated (r [~]1.0). Seventeen genera were classified as signatures of dysbiosis because they had significantly higher abundances in patients with periodontitis and edentulism when contrasted with health. Similarly, 13 genera were classified as signatures of periodontitis, and 14 genera were classified as signatures of edentulism. The signatures could be used, individually or in combination, to assess the clinical status of a patient (e.g., evaluating treatments such as antibiotic therapies). Comparisons of the same patient samples revealed high false negatives (45%) for next-generation-sequencing results and low false positives (7%) for Gene Meter results.",

While cancer is the most studied disease associated with somatic variations, recent advances in single cell and ultra deep sequencing indicate that a number of phenotypes and pathologies are impacted by cell specific variants. Currently, the accurate identification of low allelic frequency somatic variants relies on a combination of deep sequencing coverage and multiple evidences of the presence of variants. However, in this study we show that false positive variants can account for more than 70% of identified somatic variations, rendering conventional detection methods inadequate for accurate determination of low allelic variants. Interestingly, these false positive variants primarily originate from mutagenic DNA damage which directly confounds determination of genuine somatic mutations. Furthermore, we developed and validated a simple metric to measure mutagenic DNA damage, and demonstrated that mutagenic DNA damage is the leading cause of sequencing errors in widely used resources including the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.",

    "abstract": "In systems biology and genomics, epistasis characterizes the impact that a substitution at a particular location in a genome can have on a substitution at another location. This phenomenon is often implicated in the evolution of drug resistance or to explain why particular  disease-causing mutations do not have the same outcome in all individuals. Hence, uncovering these mutations and their locations in a genome is a central question in biology. However, epistasis is notoriously difficult to uncover, especially in fast-evolving organisms. Here, we present a novel statistical approach that replies on a model developed in ecology and that we adapt to analyze genetic data in fast-evolving systems such as the influenza A virus. We validate the approach using a two-pronged strategy: extensive simulations demonstrate a low-to-moderate sensitivity with excellent specificity and precision, while analyses of experimentally-validated data recover known interactions, including in a eukaryotic system. We further evaluate the ability of our approach to detect correlated evolution during antigenic shifts or at the emergence of drug resistance. We show that in all cases, correlated evolution is prevalent in influenza A viruses, involving many pairs of sites linked together in chains, a hallmark of historical contingency. Strikingly, interacting sites are separated by large physical distances, which entails either long-range conformational changes or functional tradeoffs, for which we find support with the emergence of drug resistance. Our work paves a new way for the unbiased detection of epistasis in a wide range of organisms by performing whole-genome scans.",

    "abstract": "O_LIBarley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is an established model to study domestication of the Fertile Crescent cereals. Recent molecular data suggested that domesticated barley genomes consist of the ancestral blocks descending from multiple wild barley populations. However, the relationship between the mosaic ancestry patterns and the process of domestication itself remained unclear.\\nC_LIO_LITo address this knowledge gap, we identified candidate domestication genes using selection scans based on targeted resequencing of 433 wild and domesticated barley accessions. We conducted phylogenetic, population structure, and ancestry analyses to investigate the origin of the domesticated barley haplotypes separately at the neutral and candidate domestication loci.\\nC_LIO_LIWe discovered multiple selective sweeps that occurred on all barley chromosomes during domestication in the background of several ancestral wild populations. The ancestry analyses demonstrated that, although the ancestral blocks of the domesticated barley genomes descended from all over the Fertile Crescent, the candidate domestication loci originated specifically in its eastern and western parts.\\nC_LIO_LIThese findings provided first molecular evidence in favor of multiple barley domestications in the Levantine and Zagros clusters of the origin of agriculture.\\nC_LI",
