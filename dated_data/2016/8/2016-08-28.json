    "abstract": "In vertebrates and other Metazoa, developmental genes are found surrounded by dense clusters of highly conserved noncoding elements (CNEs). CNEs exhibit extreme levels of sequence conservation of unexplained origin, with many acting as long-range enhancers during development. Clusters of CNEs, termed genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), define the span of regulatory interactions for many important developmental regulators. The function and genomic distribution of these elements close to important regulatory genes raises the question of how they relate to the 3D conformation of these loci. We show that GRBs, defined using clusters of CNEs, coincide strongly with the patterns of topological organisation in metazoan genomes, predicting the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs) at hundreds of loci. The set of TADs that are associated with high levels of non-coding conservation exhibit distinct properties compared to TADs called in chromosomal regions devoid of extreme non-coding conservation. The correspondence between GRBs and TADs suggests that TADs around developmental genes are ancient, slowly evolving genomic structures, many of which have had conserved spans for hundreds of millions of years. This relationship also explains the difference in TAD numbers and sizes between genomes. While the close correspondence between extreme conservation and the boundaries of this subset of TADs does not reveal the mechanism leading to the conservation of these elements, it provides a functional framework for studying the role of TADs in long-range transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "A.Integrative networks combine multiple layers of biological data into a model of how genes work together to carry out cellular processes. Such networks become more valuable as they become more context specific, for example, by capturing how genes work together in a certain tissue or cell type. Once constructed, these networks provide the means to identify broad biological patterns underlying genes associated with complex traits and diseases. In this review, we discuss the different types of integrative networks that currently exist and how such networks that encompass multiple biological layers are constructed. We highlight how specificity can be incorporated into the reconstruction of different types of biomolecular interactions between genes, using tissue-specificity as a motivating example. We identify examples of cases where networks have been applied to study human diseases and discuss opportunities for new applications.",

    "abstract": "Traditional genome-wide scans for positive selection have mainly uncovered selective sweeps associated with monogenic traits. While selection on quantitative traits is much more common, very few signals have been detected because of their polygenic nature. We searched for positive selection signals underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) in worldwide populations, using novel approaches to quantify relationships between polygenic selection signals and CAD genetic risk. We identified new candidate adaptive loci that appear to have been directly modified by disease pressures given their significant associations with CAD genetic risk. These candidates were all uniquely and consistently associated with many different male and female reproductive traits suggesting selection may have also targeted these because of their direct effects on fitness. This suggests the presence of widespread antagonistic-pleiotropic tradeoffs on CAD loci, which provides a novel explanation for the maintenance and high prevalence of CAD in modern humans. Lastly, we found that positive selection more often targeted CAD gene regulatory variants using HapMap3 lymphoblastoid cell lines, which further highlights the unique biological significance of candidate adaptive loci underlying CAD. Our study provides a novel approach for detecting selection on polygenic traits and evidence that modern human genomes have evolved in response to CAD-induced selection pressures and other early-life traits sharing pleiotropic links with CAD.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHow genetic variation contributes to disease is complex, especially for those such as coronary artery disease (CAD) that develop over the lifetime of individuals. One of the fundamental questions about CAD -- whose progression begins in young adults with arterial plaque accumulation leading to life-threatening outcomes later in life -- is why natural selection has not removed or reduced this costly disease. It is the leading cause of death worldwide and has been present in human populations for thousands of years, implying considerable pressures that natural selection should have operated on. Our study provides new evidence that genes underlying CAD have recently been modified by natural selection and that these same genes uniquely and extensively contribute to human reproduction, which suggests that natural selection may have maintained genetic variation contributing to CAD because of its beneficial effects on fitness. This study provides novel evidence that CAD has been maintained in modern humans as a byproduct of the fitness advantages those genes provide early in human lifecycles.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant cell signaling is known to cause cancer and many other diseases, as well as a focus of treatment. A common approach is to infer its activity on the level of pathways using gene expression. However, mapping gene expression to pathway components disregards the effect of post-translational modifications, and downstream signatures represent very specific experimental conditions. Here we present PROGENy, a method that overcomes both limitations by leveraging a large compendium of publicly available perturbation experiments to yield a common core of Pathway RespOnsive GENes. Unlike existing methods, PROGENy can (i) recover the effect of known driver mutations, (ii) provide or improve strong markers for drug indications, and (iii) distinguish between oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways for patient survival. Collectively, these results show that PROGENy more accurately infers pathway activity from gene expression than other methods.",

    "abstract": "The innate-immune restriction factor MxA inhibits influenza replication by targeting the viral nucleoprotein (NP). Human influenza is more resistant than avian influenza to inhibition by human MxA, and prior work has compared human and avian viral strains to identify amino-acid differences in NP that affect sensitivity to MxA. However, this strategy is limited to identifying sites in NP where mutations that affect MxA sensitivity have fixed during the small number of documented zoonotic transmissions of influenza to humans. Here we use an unbiased deep mutational scanning approach to quantify how all {approx}10,000 amino-acid mutations to NP affect MxA sensitivity. We both identify new sites in NP where mutations affect MxA resistance and re-identify mutations known to have increased MxA resistance during historical adaptations of influenza to humans. Most of the sites where mutations have the greatest effect are almost completely conserved across all influenza A viruses, and the amino acids at these sites confer relatively high resistance to MxA. These sites cluster in regions of NP that appear to be important for its recognition by MxA. Overall, our work systematically identifies the sites in influenza nucleoprotein where mutations affect sensitivity to MxA. We also demonstrate a powerful new strategy for identifying regions of viral proteins that affect interactions with host factors.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDuring viral infection, human cells express proteins that can restrict virus replication. However, in many cases it remains unclear what determines the sensitivity of a given viral strain to a particular restriction factor. Here we use a high-throughput approach to measure how all amino-acid mutations to the nucleoprotein of influenza virus affect restriction by the human protein MxA. We find several dozen sites where mutations substantially affect influenzas sensitivity to MxA. While a few of these sites are known to have fixed mutations during past adaptations of influenza to humans, most of the sites are broadly conserved across all influenza strains and have never previously been described as affecting MxA resistance. Our results therefore show that the known historical evolution of influenza has only involved substitutions at a small fraction of the sites where mutations can in principle affect MxA resistance. We suggest that this is because many sites are already broadly fixed at amino acids that confer high resistance.",
