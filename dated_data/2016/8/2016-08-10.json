    "abstract": "Some diseases are caused by genetic loci with a high rate of change, and heritability in complex traits is likely to be partially caused by variation at these loci. These hypermutable elements, such as tandem repeats, change at rates that are orders of magnitude higher than the rates at which most single nucleotides mutate. However, single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, are currently the primary focus of genetic studies of human disease. Here we quantify the degree to which SNPs are correlated with hypermutable loci by examining a range of mutation rates. We use established population genetics theory to relate mutation rates to recombination rates and compare the theoretical predictions to simulations. Both simulations and theory agree that, at the highest mutation rates, almost all correlation is lost between a hypermutable locus and surrounding SNPs. The theoretical predictions break down as the mutation rate increases, and consequently differ widely from the simulated results. The simulation results suggest that some correlation remains between SNPs and hypermutable loci when mutation rates are on the lower end of the mutation spectrum. Consequently, in some cases SNPs can tag variation caused by some hypermutable loci. We also examine the linkage between SNPs and other SNPs and uncover ways in which the linkage disequilibrium of rare SNPs differs from that of hypermutable loci.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping is a powerful technique for dissecting the genetic basis of traits and species differences. Established tomato mapping populations between domesticated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and its more distant interfertile relatives typically follow a near isogenic line (NIL) design, such as the Solanum pennellii Introgression Line (IL) population, with a single wild introgression per line in an otherwise domesticated genetic background. Here we report on a new advanced backcross QTL mapping resource for tomato, derived from a cross between the M82 tomato cultivar and S. pennelli. This so-called Backcrossed Inbred Line (BIL) population is comprised of a mix of BC2 and BC3 lines, with domesticated tomato as the recurrent parent. The BIL population is complementary to the existing S. pennellii IL population, with which it shares parents. Using the BILs we mapped traits for leaf complexity, leaflet shape, and flowering time. We demonstrate the utility of the BILs for fine-mapping QTL, particularly QTL initially mapped in the ILs, by fine-mapping several QTL to single or few candidate genes. Moreover, we confirm the value of a backcrossed population with multiple introgressions per line, such as the BILs, for epistatic QTL mapping. Our work was further enabled by the development of our own statistical inference and visualization tools, namely a heterogeneous Hidden Markov Model for genotyping the lines, and by using state of the art sparse regression techniques for QTL mapping.",

We examined reasons for normal pupation but early pupal death observed in certain cases.\\n\\nResultsOver-expression of activated Ras in developing eye/wing discs inhibited Ptth expression in brain via up-regulated JNK signaling mediated Dilp8 secretion from imaginal discs, which inhibited ecdysone synthesis in prothoracic gland after pupariation, leading to death of ~25-30 Hr old pupae. Inhibition of elevated Ras signaling completely rescued early pupal death while post-pupation administration of ecdysone to organisms with elevated Ras signaling in eye discs partially rescued their early pupal death. Unlike the earlier known Dilp8 action in delaying pupation, hyperactivated Ras mediated elevation of pJNK signaling in imaginal discs caused Dilp8 secretion after pupariation. Ectopic expression of certain other transgene causing pupal lethality similarly enhanced pJNK and early pupal Dilp8. Sub-optimal ecdysone levels after 8 Hr of pupation prevented the early pupal metamorphic changes and caused organismal death.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results reveal early pupal stage as a novel Dilp8 mediated post-pupariation checkpoint and provide further evidence for inter-organ signaling during development, wherein a peripheral tissue influences the CNS driven endocrine function.",

    "abstract": "Recognition of personally familiar faces is remarkably efficient, effortless and robust. We asked if feature-based face processing facilitates detection of familiar faces by testing the effect of face inversion on a visual search task for familiar and unfamiliar faces. Because face inversion disrupts configural and holistic face processing, we hypothesized that inversion would diminish the familiarity advantage to the extent that it is mediated by such processing. Subjects detected personally familiar and stranger target faces in arrays of two, four, or six face images. Subjects showed significant facilitation of personally familiar face detection for both upright and inverted faces. The effect of familiarity on target absent trials, which involved only rejection of unfamiliar face distractors, suggests that familiarity facilitates rejection of unfamiliar distractors as well as detection of familiar targets. The preserved familiarity effect for inverted faces suggests that facilitation of face detection afforded by familiarity reflects mostly feature-based processes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) as a public health emergency in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) occurred during a period of severe drought and unusually high temperatures. Speculation in the literature exists that these climate conditions were associated with the 2015/2016 El Nino event and/or climate change but to date no quantitative assessment has been made. Analysis of related flaviviruses -such as dengue and chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same vectors- suggests that ZIKV dynamics is sensitive to climate seasonality and longer-term variability and trends. A better understanding the climate conditions conducive to the 2014-2016 epidemic may permit the development of climate-informed short- and long-term strategies for ZIKV prevention and control.\\n\\nResultsUsing a novel timescale-decomposition methodology, we demonstrate that extreme climate anomalies observed in most parts of South America during the current epidemic are not caused exclusively by El Nino or climate change -as speculated-, but are the result of a particular combination of climate signals acting at multiple timescales. In Brazil, the heart of the epidemic, we find that dry conditions present during 2013-2015 are explained primarily by year-to-year variability superimposed on decadal variability, but with little contribution of long-term trends. In contrast, the extreme warm temperatures of 2014-2015 resulted from the compound effect of climate change, decadal and year-to-year climate variability.\\n\\nConclusionsZIKV response strategies adapted for a drought context in Brazil during El Nino 2015/2016 may need to be revised to accommodate the likely return of heavy rainfall associated with the probable 2016/2017 La Nina. Temperatures are likely to remain warm given the importance of long term and decadal scale climate signals.",

    "abstract": "Leaf shape is spectacularly diverse. As the primary source of photo-assimilate in major crops, understanding the evolutionary and environmentally induced changes in leaf morphology are critical to improving agricultural productivity. The role of leaf shape in cotton domestication is unique, as breeders have purposefully selected for entire and lobed leaf morphs resulting from a single locus, okra (L-D1). The okra locus is not only of agricultural importance in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), but through pioneering chimeric and morphometric studies it has contributed to fundamental knowledge about leaf development. Here we show that the major leaf shapes of cotton at the L-D1 locus are controlled by a HD-Zip transcription factor most similar to Late Meristem Identity1 (LMI1) gene. The classical okra leaf shape gene has133-bp tandem duplication in the promoter, correlated with elevated expression, while an 8-bp deletion in the third exon of the presumed wild-type normal leaf causes a frame-shifted and truncated coding sequence. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of this LMI1-like gene in an okra variety was sufficient to induce normal leaf formation. An intermediate leaf shape allele, sub-okra, lacks both the promoter duplication and the exonic deletion. Our results indicate that sub-okra is the ancestral leaf shape of tetraploid cotton and normal is a derived mutant allele that came to predominate and define the leaf shape of cultivated cotton.",

    "abstract": "One central goal of genome biology is to understand how the usage of the genome differs between organisms. Our knowledge of genome composition, needed for downstream inferences, is critically dependent on gene annotations, yet problems associated with gene annotation and assembly errors are usually ignored in comparative genomics. Here we analyze the genomes of 68 species across all animal groups and some single-cell eukaryotes for general trends in genome usage and composition, taking into account problems of gene annotation. We show that, regardless of genome size, essentially all animals have comparable amounts of introns and intergenic sequence, with nearly all deviations dominated by increased intergenic sequence. Genomes of model organisms have ratios much closer to 1:1, suggesting that the majority of published genomes of non-model organisms are underannotated and consequently omit substantial numbers of genes, with likely negative impact on evolutionary interpretations. Finally, our results also indicate that most animals transcribe half or more of their genomes arguing against differences in genome usage between animal groups, and also suggesting that the transcribed portion is more dependent on genome size than previously thought.\\n\\nAuthors SummaryWithin our anthropocentric genomic framework, many analyses tends to try to define humans, mammals, or vertebrates relative to the so-called \\\"lower\\\" animals. This implicitly posits that vertebrates are complex organisms with large genomes and invertebrates are simple organisms with small genomes. This has the problem that genome size is therefore presumed to correlate with complexity and ignores any unknown complexity of vast numbers of invertebrate groups, many with large genomes. Animals vary widely in genome size, by almost three orders of magnitude, but when sequencing new animal genomes preference is given to those with smaller genomes for reasons of cost. In trying to understand how genomes are used in general, there is an added layer of complication from quality of the assembly and annotation. We have examined genome usage across a wide range of animals and have described ways to account for errors of low-quality annotations. We also show that the genomes of invertebrates and vertebrates are not so different, and that when large-genome invertebrates are added, genome size alone appears to be defining the fraction of the genome that is genes.",

    "abstract": "Parallel divergence patterns across replicated species pairs occurring in similar environmental contrasts may arise through distinct evolutionary scenarios. Deciphering whether such parallelism actually reflects repeated parallel divergence driven by divergent selection or a single divergence event with subsequent gene flow needs to be ascertained. Reconstructing historical gene flow is therefore of fundamental interest to understand how demography and selection jointly shaped genomic divergence during speciation. Here, we use an extended modeling framework to explore the multiple facets of speciation-with-gene-flow with demo-genetic divergence models that capture both temporal and genomic variation in effective population size and migration rate. We investigate the divergence history of five sympatric Lake Whitefish limnetic (dwarf) and benthic (normal) species pairs characterized by variable degrees of ecological divergence and reproductive isolation. Genome-wide SNPs were used to document the extent of genetic differentiation in each species pair, and 26 divergence models were fitted and compared to the unfolded joint allele frequency spectrum of each pair. We found evidence that a recent (circa 3000-4000 generations) asymmetrical secondary contact between expanding post-glacial populations has accompanied Whitefish diversification. Our results suggest that heterogeneous genomic differentiation patterns have emerged through the combined effects of linked selection generating variable rates of lineage sorting across the genome during geographical isolation, and heterogeneous introgression eroding divergence at different rates across the genome upon secondary contact. This study thus provides a new retrospective insight into the historical demographic and selective processes that shaped a continuum of divergence associated with ecological speciation.",

    "abstract": "Barcode sequencing (bar-seq) is a high-throughput, and cost effective method to assay large numbers of lineages or genotypes in complex cell pools. Because of its advantages, applications for bar-seq are quickly growing - from using neutral random barcodes to study the evolution of microbes or cancer, to using pseudo-barcodes, such as shRNAs, sgRNAs, or transposon insertion libraries, to simultaneously screen large numbers of cell perturbations. However, the computational pipelines for bar-seq have not been well developed. Available methods, which use prior information and/or simple brute-force comparisons, are slow and often result in overclustering artifacts that group distinct barcodes together. Here, we developed Bartender: an ultrafast and accurate clustering algorithm to detect barcodes and their abundances from raw next-generation sequencing data. To improve speed and reduce unnecessary pairwise comparisons, Bartender employs a divide-and-conquer strategy that intelligently sorts barcode reads into distinct bins before performing comparisons. To improve accuracy and reduce over-clustering artifacts, Bartender employs a modified two-sample proportion test that uses information on both the cluster sequence distances and cluster sizes to make merging decisions. Additionally, Bartender includes a \\\"multiple time point\\\" mode, which matches barcode clusters between different clustering runs for seamless handling of time course data. For both simulated and real data, Bartender clusters millions of unique barcodes in a few minutes at high accuracy (>99.9%), and is ~100-fold faster than previous methods. Bartender is a set of simple-to-use command line tools that can be performed on a laptop.\\n\\nAvailabilityBartender is available at no charge for non-commercial use at https://github.com/LaoZZZZZ/bartender-1.1.",

During a median follow-up of just over 7 years, there were 314 deaths. In a Cox proportional hazards model that accounted for age, sex, and location (which was treated as a time-dependent covariate), age and sex were strong predictors of mortality, but location was only marginally predictive. Among 273 chimpanzees who were transferred to the federal sanctuary, we found no material increased risk in mortality in the first 30 days after arrival. During a median follow-up at the sanctuary of 3.5 years, age was strongly predictive of mortality, but other variables - sex, season of arrival, and ambient temperature on the day of arrival - were not predictive. We confirmed our regression findings using random survival forests. In summary, in a large cohort of captive chimpanzees, we find no evidence of materially important associations of location of residence or recent transfer with premature mortality.",

Although numerous recent advances have been made in the ability to precisely manipulate the zebrafish genome, much less is known about many aspects learning and memory in adult fish. Here, we develop a contextual fear conditioning paradigm using an electric shock as the aversive stimulus. We find that contextual fear conditioning is modulated by shock intensity, prevented by inhibition of (N-methyl-D-aspartate) NMDA receptors, lasts at least 14 days, and exhibits extinction. Furthermore, fish of various background strains (AB, Tu, and TL) are able to acquire fear conditioning, but differ in fear extinction rates. Taken together, we find that contextual fear conditioning in zebrafish shares many similarities with the widely used contextual fear conditioning paradigm in rodents. Combined with the amenability of genetic manipulation in zebrafish, we anticipate that our paradigm will prove to be a useful complementary system in which to examine the molecular basis of vertebrate learning and memory.",

To ascertain the diagnostic power of this approach we determined the extent of coverage per individual sample.

Samples sequenced at 50X mean coverage had, on average, up to 50% of the Ensembl annotated exons with at least one nucleotide (L=1) with a DP<20, improving to 35% at 100X mean coverage.

Initially, we demonstrate with a model of an ideal experiment that we are able to identify model parameters for agent motility and adhesion, given we choose appropriate summary statistics. Following this, we replace our model of an ideal experiment with a model representative of a practically realisable experiment. We demonstrate that, given the current (and commonly used) experimental set-up, model parameters cannot be accurately identified using approximate Bayesian computation methods. We compare new experimental designs through simulation, and show more accurate identification of model parameters is possible by expanding the size of the domain upon which the experiment is performed, as opposed to increasing the number of experimental repeats. The results presented in this work therefore describe time and cost-saving alterations for a commonly performed experiment for identifying cell motility parameters. Moreover, the results presented in this work will be of interest to those concerned with performing experiments that allow for the accurate identification of parameters governing cell migratory processes, especially cell migratory processes in which cell-cell adhesion or repulsion are known to play a significant role.",

    "abstract": "Most existing dimensionality reduction and clustering packages for single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data deal with dropouts by heavy modelling and computational machinery. Here we introduce CIDR (Clustering through Imputation and Dimensionality Reduction), an ultrafast algorithm which uses a novel yet very simple  implicit imputation approach to alleviate the impact of dropouts in scRNA-Seq data in a principled manner. Using a range of simulated and real data, we have shown that CIDR improves the standard principal component analysis and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, namely t-SNE, ZIFA and RaceID, in terms of clustering accuracy. CIDR typically completes within seconds for processing a data set of hundreds of cells, and minutes for a data set of thousands of cells. CIDR can be downloaded at https://github.org/VCCRI/CIDR.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSpecies distribution models (SDMs) have an important role in predicting the range of emerging and understudied pathogens and parasites. Their use, however, is often limited by the lack of high-resolution unbiased occurrence records. Echinococcus multilocularis is a parasitic cestode of public health importance which is widely distributed throughout Eu rasia and is considered an emerging threat in North America. In common with many parasite species, available data for E. multilocularis occurrence are spatially biased and often poorly geo-referenced.\\n\\nResultsHere we produce three separate SDMs using MaxEnt for E. multilocularis using varying complexities of sampling schemes and environmental predictors, designed to make the best possible use of non-ideal occurrence data. The most realistic model utilized both derived and basic climatic predictors; an occurrence sampling scheme which relied primarily on high resolution occurrences from the literature and a bias grid to compensate for an apparently uneven research effort. All models predicted extensive regions of high suitability for E. multilocularis in North America, where the parasite is poorly studied and not currently under coordinated surveillance.\\n\\nConclusionsThrough a pragmatic approach to non-ideal occurrence data we were able to produce a statistically well supported SDM for an under-studied species of public health importance. Although the final model was only trained on data from Eurasia, the global model projection encompassed all known occurrences in the United States. The approach defined here may be applicable to many other such species and could provide useful information to direct resources for future field based surveillance programs for E. multilocularis in North America.",

    "abstract": "The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) is the primary source for post-marketing pharmacovigilance. Though potentially highly useful, the database reflects reporting biases, stimulated reporting, and suffers from lack of standardization and the use of multiple drug synonyms. These biases can suggest adverse drug reactions (ADRs) where none exist, and can obscure others that do exist. To decrease the noise in FAERS, and to reinforce important associations, we mapped over 750,000 drug identifiers in FAERS to the normalized chemical structures of their ingredients. This illuminated associations that would not otherwise be apparent, and also allowed a time-resolved analysis of ADR reporting. It also revealed similarities between drugs and adverse events across therapeutic classes, enabling unbiased classification of adverse events, indications, and drugs with similar clinical profiles. For instance, comparison of two selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, celecoxib and rofecoxib finds distinctive FAERS profiles after time-resolved analysis. We also investigated key idiosyncrasies, such as confusion between drug indications and drug ADRs, which can tar a drug treating a life-threatening disease, like thalidomides use against myeloma, with a deadly ADR that is likely the result of the disease itself, multiplications of the same report, which unjustifiably increases its apparent importance, and the correlation of reported ADRs with public events, regulatory announcements, and with publications. Comparing the pharmacological, pharmacokinetic, and clinical ADR profiles of methylphenidate, aripiprazole and risperidone, and of kinase drugs targeting the VEGF receptor (VEGF-R2), demonstrates how underlying molecular mechanisms can emerge from ADR co-analysis. The precautions and methods we describe may enable investigators to avoid confounding chemistry-based associations and reporting biases in FAERS, and illustrate how comparative analysis of ADRs can reveal underlaying mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The importance of taxon sampling in phylogenetic accuracy is a topic of active debate. We investigated the role of taxon sampling in causing incongruent results between two recent phylogenomic studies of stinging wasps (Hymenoptera: Aculeata), a diverse lineage that includes ants, bees and the majority of eusocial insects. Using target enrichment of ultraconserved element (UCE) loci, we assembled the largest aculeate phylogenomic data set to date, sampling 854 loci from 187 taxa, including 30 out of 31 aculeate families, and a diversity of parasitoid outgroups. We analyzed the complete matrix using multiple analytical approaches, and also performed a series of taxon inclusion/exclusion experiments, in which we analyzed taxon sets identical to and slightly modified from the previous phylogenomic studies. Our results provide a highly supported phylogeny for virtually all aculeate lineages sampled, supporting ants as sister to Apoidea (bees+apoid wasps), bees as sister to Philanthinae+Pemphredoninae (lineages within a paraphyletic Crabronidae), Melittidae as sister to remaining bees, and paraphyly of cuckoo wasps (Chrysidoidea). Our divergence dating analyses estimate ages for aculeate lineages in close concordance with the fossil record. Our analyses also demonstrate that outgroup choice and taxon evenness can fundamentally impact topology and clade support in phylogenomic inference.",
