    "abstract": "The origin of the germline-soma distinction is a fundamental unsolved question. Plants and basal metazoans do not have a germline but generate gametes from somatic tissues (somatic gametogenesis), whereas most bilaterians sequester a germline. We develop an evolutionary model which shows that selection for mitochondrial quality drives germline evolution. In organisms with low mitochondrial mutation rates, segregation of mutations over multiple cell divisions generates variation, allowing selection to optimize gamete quality through somatic gametogenesis. Higher mutation rates promote early germline sequestration. Oogamy reduces mitochondrial segregation in early development, improving adult fitness by restricting variation between tissues, but also limiting variation between early-sequestered oocytes, undermining gamete quality. Oocyte variation is restored through proliferation and random culling (atresia) of precursor cells. We predict a novel pathway from basal metazoans lacking a germline to active bilaterians with early sequestration of large oocytes subject to atresia, allowing the emergence of complex developmental processes.",

    "abstract": "Nervous system function requires intracellular transport of channels, receptors, mRNAs, and other cargo throughout complex neuronal morphologies. Local signals such as synaptic input can regulate cargo trafficking, motivating the leading conceptual model of neuron-wide transport, sometimes called the \\\"sushi-belt model\\\" (Doyle and Kiebler, 2011). Current theories and experiments are based on this model, yet its predictions are not rigorously understood. We formalized the sushi belt model mathematically, showing how it can achieve arbitrarily complex spatial distributions of cargo in reconstructed morphologies. However, the model also predicts an unavoidable, morphology dependent tradeoff between speed, precision and metabolic efficiency of cargo transport. With experimental estimates of trafficking kinetics, the model predicts delays of many hours or days for modestly accurate and efficient cargo delivery throughout a dendritic tree. These findings challenge current understanding of the efficacy of nucleus-to-synapse trafficking and may explain the prevalence of local biosynthesis in neurons.",

    "abstract": "Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) has rapidly become a valuable model species for a variety of studies including functional genomics. A high-throughput method to obtain transgenic lines sooner than standard methods would greatly advance gene function studies. The goal of this study was to optimize our current transformation method by investigating medium components that would result in a decreased time for recovery of transgenics. For this study, 6-day-old cotyledon explants from Solanum lycopersicum cultivar M82 in vitro-grown seedlings were infected with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 containing the binary vector pBI121. This vector contains the {beta}-glucuronidase reporter gene and the neomycin phosphotransferase II selectable marker gene that confers resistance to kanamycin. Modification of our standard plant regeneration medium with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) at concentrations of either 0.05 mg/l or 0.1 mg/l decreased the recovery time for transgenic lines by 6 weeks as compared to our standard medium that contains zeatin as the only plant growth regulator. We observed 50% and 54% transformation efficiency on plant regeneration medium containing 0.05 mg/l and 0.1 mg/l IAA, respectively. Moreover, addition of 1 mg/l IAA to the root induction medium resulted in earlier root development than medium that did not contain IAA. Addition of IAA to the plant regeneration and rooting media did not have any negative effects on plant development. Recovery of transgenic lines in a shorter time results in higher throughput for the introduction of gene constructs and has the potential to decrease the time and resources needed to complete investigations of gene function.",

Novel experimental approaches combined with NGS methods enable accurate and extensive studies of the fitness effects of mutations - allowing us to test theoretical predictions and improve our understanding of the shape of the true underlying fitness landscape, and its implications for the predictability and repeatability of evolution.\\n\\nHere, we present a uniquely large multi-allelic fitness landscape comprised of 640 engineered mutants that represent all possible combinations of 13 amino-acid changing mutations at six sites in the heat-shock protein Hsp90 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under elevated salinity. Despite a prevalent pattern of negative epistasis in the landscape, we find that the global fitness peak is reached via four positively epistatic mutations. Combining traditional and extending recently proposed theoretical and statistical approaches, we quantify features of the global multi-allelic fitness landscape. Using subsets of the data, we demonstrate that extrapolation beyond a known part of the landscape is difficult owing to both local ruggedness and amino-acid specific epistatic hotspots, and that inference is additionally confounded by the non-random choice of mutations for experimental fitness landscapes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe study of fitness landscapes is fundamentally concerned with understanding the relative roles of stochastic and deterministic processes in adaptive evolution.

Using a combination of traditional and recently proposed theoretical approaches, they study the accessibility of the global fitness peak, and the potential for predictability of the fitness landscape topography.

    "abstract": "Metagenome shotgun sequencing presents opportunities to identify organisms that may prevent or promote disease. The analysis of sample diversity is achieved by taxonomic identification of metagenomic reads followed by generating an abundance profile. Numerous tools have been developed based on different design principles. Tools achieving high precision can lack sensitivity in some applications. Conversely, tools with high sensitivity can suffer from low precision and require long computation time. In this paper, we present WEVOTE (WEighted VOting Taxonomic idEntification), a method that classifies metagenome shotgun sequencing DNA reads based on an ensemble of existing methods using k-mer-based, marker-based, and naive-similarity based approaches. Our evaluation on fourteen benchmarking datasets shows that WEVOTE improves the classification precision by reducing false positive annotations while preserving a high level of sensitivity. WEVOTE is an efficient and automated tool that combines multiple individual taxonomic identification methods to produce more precise and sensitive microbial profiles. WEVOTE is developed primarily to identify reads generated by MetaGenome Shotgun sequencing. It is expandable and has the potential to incorporate additional tools to produce a more accurate taxonomic profile. WEVOTE was implemented using C++ and shell scripting and is available at www.bitbucket.org/ametwally/wevote",

    "abstract": "Reproducing experiments is vital to science. Being able to replicate, validate and extend previous work also speeds new research projects. Reproducing computational biology experiments, which are scripted, should be straightforward. But reproducing such work remains challenging and time consuming. In the ideal world we would be able to quickly and easily rewind to the precise computing environment where results were generated. We would then be able to reproduce the original analysis or perform new analyses. We introduce a process termed \\\"continuous analysis\\\" which provides inherent reproducibility to computational research at a minimal cost to the researcher. Continuous analysis combines Docker, a container service similar to virtual machines, with continuous integration, a popular software development technique, to automatically re-run computational analysis whenever relevant changes are made to the source code. This allows results to be reproduced quickly, accurately and without needing to contact the original authors. Continuous analysis also provides an audit trail for analyses that use data with sharing restrictions. This allows reviewers, editors, and readers to verify reproducibility without manually downloading and rerunning any code. Example configurations are available at our online repository (https://github.com/greenelab/continuous_analysis).",

    "abstract": "If improvements are to be made in tuberculosis (TB) treatment, an increased understanding of disease in the lung is needed. Studies have shown that bacteria in a less metabolically active state, associated with the presence of lipid bodies, are less susceptible to antibiotics, and recent results have highlighted the disparity in concentration of different compounds into lesions. Treatment success therefore depends critically on the responses of the individual bacteria that constitute the infection.\\n\\nWe propose a hybrid, individual-based approach that analyses spatio-temporal dynamics at the cellular level, linking the behaviour of individual bacteria and host cells with the macroscopic behaviour of the microenvironment. The individual elements (bacteria, macrophages and T cells) are modelled using cellular automaton (CA) rules, and the evolution of oxygen, drugs and chemokine dynamics are incorporated in order to study the effects of the microenvironment in the pathological lesion. We allow bacteria to switch states depending on oxygen concentration, which affects how they respond to treatment. This is the first multiscale model of its type to consider both oxygen-driven phenotypic switching of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis and antibiotic treatment. Using this model, we investigate the role of bacterial cell state and of initial bacterial location on treatment outcome. We demonstrate that when bacteria are located further away from blood vessels, less favourable outcomes are more likely, i.e. longer time before infection is contained/cleared, treatment failure or later relapse. We also show that in cases where bacteria remain at the end of simulations, the organisms tend to be slower-growing and are often located within granulomas, surrounded by caseous material.",

    "abstract": "SummaryO_LIIt is now widely accepted that genetic processes such as inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variation can increase the extinction risk of small populations. However, it is generally unclear whether extinction risk from genetic causes gradually increases with decreasing population size or whether there is a sharp transition around a specific threshold population size. In the ecological literature, such threshold phenomena are called \\\"strong Allee effects\\\" and they can arise for example from mate limitation in small populations.\\nC_LIO_LIIn this study, we aim to a) develop a meaningful notion of a \\\"strong genetic Allee effect\\\", b) explore whether and under what conditions such an effect can arise from inbreeding depression due to recessive deleterious mutations, and c) quantify the interaction of potential genetic Allee effects with the well-known mate-finding Allee effect.\\nC_LIO_LIWe define a strong genetic Allee effect as a genetic process that causes a populations survival probability to be a sigmoid function of its initial size. The inflection point of this function defines the critical population size. To characterize survival-probability curves, we develop and analyze simple stochastic models for the ecology and genetics of small populations.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results indicate that inbreeding depression can indeed cause a strong genetic Allee effect, but only if individuals carry sufficiently many deleterious mutations (lethal equivalents) on average and if these mutations are spread across sufficiently many loci. Populations suffering from a genetic Allee effect often first grow, then decline as inbreeding depression sets in, and then potentially recover as deleterious mutations are purged. Critical population sizes of ecological and genetic Allee effects appear to be often additive, but even superadditive interactions are possible.\\nC_LIO_LIMany published estimates for the number of lethal equivalents in birds and mammals fall in the parameter range where strong genetic Allee effects are expected. Unfortunately, extinction risk due to genetic Allee effects can easily be underestimated as populations with genetic problems often grow initially, but then crash later. Also interactions between ecological and genetic Allee effects can be strong and should not be neglected when assessing the viability of endangered or introduced populations.\\nC_LI",

A growing number of studies have started to focus on brain dynamics as a mechanism for temporal encoding. Although there is growing evidence in favour of this view from computational and in vitro studies, there is still a lack of results from experiments in humans. We show that high-dimensional brain states revealed by multivariate pattern analysis of human EEG are correlated to temporal judgements. First, we show that, as participants estimate temporal intervals, the spatiotemporal dynamics of their brain activity are consistent across trials. Second, we present evidence that these dynamics exhibit properties of temporal perception, such as the scalar property. Lastly, we show that it is possible to predict temporal judgements based on brain states. These results show how scalp recordings can reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of human brain activity related to temporal processing.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in single-cell time-lapse microscopy have revealed non-genetic heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations of cellular phenotypes. While different phenotypic traits such as abundance of growth-related proteins in single cells may have differential effects on the reproductive success of cells, rigorous experimental quantification of this process has remained elusive due to the complexity of single cell physiology within the context of a proliferating population. We introduce and apply a practical empirical method to quantify the fitness landscapes of arbitrary phenotypic traits, using genealogical data in the form of population lineage trees which can include phenotypic data of various kinds. Our inference methodology for fitness landscapes determines how reproductivity is correlated to cellular phenotypes, and provides a natural generalization of bulk growth rate measures for single-cell histories. Using this technique, we quantify the strength of selection acting on different cellular phenotypic traits within populations, which allows us to determine whether a change in population growth is caused by individual cells response, selection within a population, or by a mixture of these two processes. By applying these methods to single-cell time-lapse data of growing bacterial populations that express a resistance-conferring protein under antibiotic stress, we show how the distributions, fitness landscapes, and selection strength of single-cell phenotypes are affected by the drug. Our work provides a unified and practical framework for quantitative measurements of fitness landscapes and selection strength for any statistical quantities definable on lineages, and thus elucidates the adaptive significance of phenotypic states in time series data. The method is applicable in diverse fields, from single cell biology to stem cell differentiation and viral evolution.",

To test if low frequency subthreshold oscillations could reduce neuronal gain during wakefulness, we measured the membrane potential of primary visual cortex (V1) layer 2/3 excitatory, parvalbumin-positive (PV+), and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) neurons in awake mice during passive visual stimulation and sensory discrimination tasks. We found prominent 3-5 Hz membrane potential oscillations that reduced the gain of excitatory neurons but not the gain of PV+ and SOM+ interneurons, which oscillated synchronously with excitatory neurons and fired strongly at the peak of de polarizations. 3-5 Hz oscillation prevalence and timing were strongly modulated by visual input and the animals behavior al response, suggesting that these oscillations are triggered to adjust sensory responses for specific behavioral contexts. Therefore, these findings reveal a novel gain reduction mechanism that adapts sensory processing to behavior.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that low and high firing neurons display different plasticity and dynamics. Here, we assess how neuronal firing changes across brain states in both the hippocampus and frontal cortices of rats. To do so, we rank-ordered rat hippocampal CA1 and frontal cortical units by their firing rates and implemented corrections to account for regression-to-the-mean. We observed remarkably consistent effects across these regions. In both regions firing rates increased during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but with relatively larger increases in high-firing versus low-firing cells accompanied by increased interneuron spiking, indicative of competitive interactions. In contrast, upon non-REM (NREM) sleep, inhibitory firing decreased, and low-firing rate neurons showed larger increases in firing compared to high-firing neurons. These state changes resulted in narrowing of firing rate distributions during each NREM episode with subsequent dispersion of distributions during REM. Following these undulations in variance over the course of sleep, the net effect of sleep was a decrease in firing-rates across all cells, which had a stronger relative effect on lower-firing neurons. Our results suggest greater plasticity in low-firing neurons and indicate that NREM sleep plays a uniquely normalizing role in sleep, while REM sleep disperses firing rates through competitive interactions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMiyawaki and colleagues analyze firing patterns separately in the hippocampus and the neocortex within and across sleep. They find that in both regions REM sleep activity is dominated by high-firing neurons and increased inhibition, resulting in a wider distribution of firing rates. On the other hand, NREM sleep produces lower inhibition, and results in a more homogenous distribution of firing rates. These findings provide insights into the effects and functions of different sleep stages on cortical neurons.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPWe describe here a new method based on a latent Dirichlet allocation model for predicting functional effects of noncoding genetic variants in a cell type and tissue specific way (FUN-LDA) by integrating diverse epigenetic annotations for specific cell types and tissues from large scale epige-nomics projects such as ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics. Using this unsupervised approach we predict tissue-specific functional effects for every position in the human genome. We demonstrate the usefulness of our predictions using several validation experiments. Using eQTL data from several sources, including the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, the Geuvadis project and Twin-sUK cohort, we show that eQTLs in specific tissues tend to be most enriched among the predicted functional variants in relevant tissues in Roadmap. We further show how these integrated functional scores can be used to derive the most likely cell/tissue type causally implicated for a complex trait using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies, and estimate a tissue-based correlation matrix of various complex traits. We find large enrichment of heritability in functional components of relevant tissues for various complex traits, with FUN-LDA yielding the highest enrichment estimates relative to existing methods. Finally, using experimentally validated functional variants from the literature and variants possibly implicated in disease by previous studies, we rigorously compare FUN-LDA to state-of-the-art functional annotation methods such as GenoSky-line, ChromHMM, Segway, and IDEAS, and show that FUN-LDA has better prediction accuracy and higher resolution compared to these methods. In summary, we describe a new approach and perform rigorous comparisons with the most commonly used functional annotation methods, providing a valuable resource for the community interested in the functional annotation of noncoding variants. Scores for each position in the human genome and for each ENCODE/Roadmap tissue are available from http://www.columbia.edu/~ii2135/funlda.html.",

Earlier Jajoo and coworkers (2014 FEBS Lett. 588:970) have shown that low pH in isolated plant thylakoid membranes induces changes in the excitation energy distribution between the two photosystems. In order to elucidate the structural background of these changes, we used small-angle neutron scattering on thylakoid membranes exposed to low p2H and show that gradually lowering the p2H from 8.0 to 5.0 causes small but well discernible reversible diminishment of the periodic order and the lamellar repeat distance and an increased mosaicity - similar to the effects elicited by light-induced acidification of the lumen.

    "abstract": "Identification of protein-protein interactions is a major goal of biological research. Despite technical advances over the last two decades, important but still largely unsolved challenges include the high-throughput detection of interactions directly from primary tissue and the identification of interactors of insoluble proteins that form higher-order structures. We have developed a novel, proximity-based labeling approach that uses antibodies to guide biotin deposition onto adjacent proteins in fixed cells and primary tissues. We used this method to profile the dynamic interactome of lamin A/C in multiple cell and tissue types under various treatment conditions. Our results suggest a considerable variation in the composition of the nuclear envelope of different tissues. Of note, DNA damage response proteins Ku70 and Ku80 are more abundant in the vicinity of lamin A/C after thermal stress. This increased affinity also applies to the progerin isoform, potentially contributing to the premature aging phenotype of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. The ability to detect protein-protein interactions in intact tissues, and to compare affinities quantitatively under different conditions or in the presence of disease mutations, can provide a new window into cell biology and disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "MotivationDespite the recent progress in genome sequencing and assembly, many of the currently available assembled genomes come in a draft form. Such draft genomes consist of a large number of genomic fragments (scaffolds), whose positions and orientations along the genome are unknown. While there exists a number of methods for reconstruction of the genome from its scaffolds, utilizing various computational and wet-lab techniques, they often can produce only partial error-prone scaffold assemblies. It therefore becomes important to compare and merge scaffold assemblies produced by different methods, thus combining their advantages and highlighting present conflicts for further investigation. These tasks may be labor intensive if performed manually.\\n\\nResultsWe present CAMSA--a tool for comparative analysis and merging of two or more given scaffold assemblies. The tool (i) creates an extensive report with several comparative quality metrics; (ii) constructs the most confident merged scaffold assembly; and (iii) provides an interactive framework for a visual comparative analysis of the given assemblies. Among the CAMSA features, only scaffold merging can be evaluated in comparison to existing methods. Namely, it resembles the functionality of assembly reconciliation tools, although their primary targets are somewhat different. Our evaluations show that CAMSA produces merged assemblies of comparable or better quality than existing assembly reconciliation tools while being the fastest in terms of the total running time.\\n\\nAvailabilityCAMSA is distributed under the MIT license and is available at http://cblab.org/camsa/.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify genetic variants associated with quantitative traits or disease. Thus, GWAS never directly link variants to regulatory mechanisms, which, in turn, are typically inferred during post-hoc analyses. In parallel, a recent deep learning-based method allows for prediction of regulatory effects per variant on currently up to 1,000 cell type-specific chromatin features. We here describe \\\"DeepWAS\\\", a new approach that directly integrates predictions of these regulatory effects of single variants into a multivariate GWAS setting. As a result, single variants associated with a trait or disease are, by design, coupled to their impact on a chromatin feature in a cell type. Up to 40,000 regulatory single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with multiple sclerosis (MS, 4,888 cases and 10,395 controls), major depressive disorder (MDD, 1,475 cases and 2,144 controls), and height (5,974 individuals) to each identify 43-61 regulatory SNPs, called deepSNPs, which are shown to reach at least nominal significance in large GWAS. MS- and height-specific deepSNPs resided in active chromatin and introns, whereas MDD-specific deepSNPs located mostly to intragenic regions and repressive chromatin states. We found deepSNPs to be enriched in public or cohort-matched expression and methylation quantitative trait loci and demonstrate the potential of the DeepWAS method to directly generate testable functional hypotheses based on genotype data alone. DeepWAS is an innovative GWAS approach with the power to identify individual SNPs in non-coding regions with gene regulatory capacity with a joint contribution to disease risk.

    "abstract": "For the last 500 years, the Americas have been a melting pot both for genetically diverse humans and for the pathogenic and commensal organisms associated with them. One such organism is the stomach dwelling bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which is highly prevalent in Latin America where it is a major current public health challenge because of its strong association with gastric cancer. By analyzing the genome sequence of H. pylori isolated in North, Central and South America, we found evidence for admixture between H. pylori of European and African origin throughout the Americas, without substantial input from pre-Columbian (hspAmerind) bacteria. In the US, strains of African and European origin have remained genetically distinct, while in Colombia and Nicaragua, bottlenecks and rampant genetic exchange amongst isolates have led to the formation of national gene pools. We found four outer membrane proteins with atypical levels of Asian ancestry in American strains, including the adhesion factor AlpB, suggesting a role for the ethnic makeup of hosts in the colonization of incoming strains. Our results show that new H. pylori subpopulations can rapidly arise, spread and adapt during times of demographic flux, and suggest that differences in transmission ecology between high and low prevalence areas may substantially affect the composition of bacterial populations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHelicobacter pylori is one of the best studied examples of an intimate association between bacteria and humans, due to its ability to colonize the stomach for decades and to transmit from generation to generation. A number of studies have sought to link diversity in H. pylori to human migrations but there are some discordant signals such as an \\\"out of Africa\\\" dispersal within the last few thousand years that has left a much stronger signal in bacterial genomes than in human ones. In order to understand how such discrepancies arise, we have investigated the evolution of H. pylori during the recent colonization of the Americas. We find that bacterial populations evolve quickly and can spread rapidly to people of different ethnicities. Distinct new bacterial subpopulations have formed in Colombia from a European source and in Nicaragua and the US from African sources. Genetic exchange between bacterial populations is rampant within Central and South America but is uncommon within North America, which may reflect differences in prevalence. Our results also suggest that adaptation of bacteria to particular human ethnic groups may be confined to a handful of genes involved in interaction with the immune system.",

    "abstract": "Depression, a common non-motor symptom of Parkinsons disease (PD), is accompanied by impaired decision making and an enhanced response to aversive outcomes. Current strategies to treat depression in PD include dopaminergic medication. However, their use can be accompanied by detrimental side effects, such as enhanced risky choice. The mechanisms underlying dopamine-induced increases in risky choice are unclear. In the current study we adopt a clinical-neuroeconomic approach to investigate the effects of dopaminergic medication on loss aversion during risky choice in depressed and non-depressed PD. Twenty-three healthy controls, 21 depressed and 22 non-depressed PD patients were assessed using a well-established gambling task measuring loss aversion during risky choice. Patients were tested on two occasions, after taking their normal dopaminergic medication (ON) and after withdrawal of their medication (OFF). Dopaminergic medication decreased loss aversion to a greater extent in depressed than non-depressed PD patients. Moreover, we show that the degree to which dopaminergic medication decreases loss aversion correlated with current depression severity and with drug effects on depression scores. These findings demonstrate that dopamine-induced changes in loss aversion depend on the presence of depressive symptoms in PD.\\n\\nSignificance statementDopaminergic medication that is used to treat motor and non-motor symptoms in patients with Parkinsons disease is known to contribute to risky decision-making. The underlying mechanisms are unclear. The present study demonstrates that dopaminergic medication in Parkinsons disease decreases loss aversion during risky choice, but only in depressed and not in non-depressed patients with Parkinsons disease. These results advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying dopamine-induced risky choice, while also identifying depression as an important factor that confers vulnerability to such dopamine-induced risky choice.\\n\\nConflict of InterestThe authors declare no competing financial interests.",

We propose to measure the intratumoral abundance of various immune cells populations with gene expression. In contrast to IHC and flow cytometry, gene expression assays yield high information content from a clinically practical workflow. Previous studies of gene expression in purified immune cells have reported hundreds of genes showing enrichment in a single cell type, but the utility of these genes in tumor samples is unknown. We describe a novel statistical method for using co-expression patterns in large tumor gene expression datasets to validate previously reported candidate cell type marker genes, and we use this method to winnow previously published gene lists down to a subset of high confidence marker genes.\\n\\nMethodsWe use co-expression patterns in 9986 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to validate previously reported cell type marker genes. We compare immune cell scores derived from these genes to measurements from flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. We characterize the reproducibility of our cell scores in replicate runs of RNA extracted from FFPE tumor tissue.\\n\\nResultsWe identify a list of 60 marker genes whose expression levels quantify 14 immune cell populations. Cell type scores calculated from these genes are concordant with flow cytometry and IHC readings, show high reproducibility in replicate RNA samples from FFPE tissue, and reveal an intricate picture of the immune infiltrate in TCGA. Most genes previously reported to be enriched in a single cell type have co-expression patterns inconsistent with cell type specificity.\\n\\nConclusionsDue to their concise gene set, computational simplicity and utility in tumor samples, these cell type gene signatures may be useful in future discovery research and clinical trials to understand how tumors and therapeutic intervention shape the immune response.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSpiral cleavage is a remarkably conserved pattern of embryogenesis present in animals of the clade Spiralia, such as annelids, molluscs, flatworms and nemerteans. However, not all spiralians display spiral cleavage. Recent phylogenies suggest that the spiral arrangement of embryonic blastomeres is an ancestral trait for the Spiralia and that it was secondarily modified in several spiralian lineages, such as gastrotrichs, brachiopods and bryozoans. To better understand the evolution of cleavage patterns in relation to blastomere fate maps and embryonic gene expression, we describe the cell lineage and molecular patterning in the embryogenesis of the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea.\\n\\nResultsM. membranacea develops through a unique stereotypic cleavage pattern with biradial symmetry and an embryo organized in identical quadrants with synchronous cell divisions. The quadrant identities are established as early as the 28-cell stage, when one vegetal blastomere (3D) activates the MAPK pathway, marking the future posterior region of the larva. Cells from this posterior quadrant divide asynchronously in subsequent stages leading to the morphological differentiation between quadrants. The first quartet of M. membranacea gives rise to the apical organ and ciliated band, the second and third quartet forms the oral/anal ectoderm, the fourth quartet the mesoderm and the vegetal blastomeres form the endoderm. We found that the early embryonic organization and the fate map of these early blastomeres in the bryozoan embryo are similar to a typical spiral-cleaving embryo. Furthermore we observe that correspondent blastomeres between the bryozoan and spiral-cleaving embryos share similar molecular identities, as revealed by the activity of MAPK and the expression of otx and foxa. The development of M. membranacea mainly differs from spiral-cleaving embryos in the downstream portions of the cell lineage, and in the origin of the mesoderm, which is formed by multiple fourth quartet blastomeres.\\n\\nConclusionsThe similarity between the fate map of M. membranacea and spiral-cleaving embryos indicates that the cleavage geometry of the bryozoan evolved decoupled from other spiralian developmental traits. In this case, the blastomere fates remained evolutionarily conserved despite the drastic modification in the cleavage pattern from spiral to biradial. These findings suggest that blastomere fates of spiral-cleaving embryos might not be linked to the stereotypic spiral cleavage pattern, but depend on other factors, such as the underlying molecular patterning. Our comparative analysis on the bryozoan reveals yet another facet of how early development evolves and helps to shed some light into the developmental diversity of spiralians.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of order, such as orientation and conformation, drives the function of most molecular assemblies in living cells, yet remains difficult to measure accurately through space and time. We built an instantaneous fluorescence polarization microscope, which simultaneously images position and orientation of fluorophores in living cells with single-molecule sensitivity and a time resolution of 100ms. We developed image acquisition and analysis methods to track single particles that interact with higher-order assemblies of molecules. We tracked the fluctuations in position and orientation of molecules from the level of an ensemble of fluorophores down to single fluorophores. We tested our system in vitro using fluorescently labeled DNA and F-actin in which the ensemble orientation of polarized fluorescence is known. We then tracked the orientation of sparsely labeled F-actin network at the leading edge of migrating human keratinocytes, revealing the anisotropic distribution of actin filaments relative to the local retrograde flow of the F-actin network. Additionally, we analyzed the position and orientation of septin-GFP molecules incorporated in septin bundles in growing hyphae of a filamentous fungus. Our data indicate that septin-GFP molecules undergo positional fluctuations within, [~]350nm of the binding site and angular fluctuations within [~]30{degrees} of the central orientation of the bundle. By reporting position and orientation of molecules while they form dynamic higher-order structures, our approach can provide new insights into how micron-scale ordered assemblies emerge from nanoscale molecules in living cells.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIn living cells, the 3D architecture of molecular assemblies such as chromosomes, lipid bilayers, and the cytoskeleton is regulated through the interaction among their component molecules. Monitoring the position and orientation of constituent molecules is important for understanding the mechanisms that govern the structure and function of these assemblies. We have developed an instantaneous fluorescence polarization microscope to track the position and orientation of fluorescently labeled particles, including single molecules, which form micron-scale macromolecular assemblies in living cells. Our imaging approach is broadly applicable to the study of dynamic molecular interactions that underpin the function of micron-scale assemblies in living cells.",

    "abstract": "Several prominent theories posit that information about recent experiences lingers in the brain and organizes memories for current experiences, by forming a temporal context that is linked to those memories at encoding. According to these theories, if the thoughts preceding an experience X resemble the thoughts preceding an experience Y, then X and Y should show an elevated probability of being recalled together. We tested this prediction by using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data to measure neural evidence for lingering processing of preceding stimuli. As predicted, memories encoded with similar lingering thoughts (about the category of preceding stimuli) were more likely to be recalled together, thereby showing that the \\\"fading embers\\\" of previous stimuli help to organize recall.",

    "abstract": "Translating genomic technologies into healthcare applications for the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has been limited by the technical and logistical difficulties of obtaining high quality clinical samples from the field. Sampling by dried blood spot (DBS) finger-pricks can be performed safely and efficiently with minimal resource and storage requirements compared with venous blood (VB). Here, we evaluate the use of selective whole genome amplification (sWGA) to sequence the P. falciparum genome from clinical DBS samples, and compare the results to current methods using leucodepleted VB. Parasite DNA with high (> 95%) human DNA contamination was selectively amplified by Phi29 polymerase using short oligonucleotide probes of 8-12 mers as primers. These primers were selected on the basis of their differential frequency of binding the desired (P. falciparum DNA) and contaminating (human) genomes. Using sWGA method, we sequenced clinical samples from 156 malaria patients, including 120 paired samples for head-to-head comparison of DBS and leucodepleted VB. Greater than 18-fold enrichment of P. falciparum DNA was achieved from DBS extracts. The parasitaemia threshold to achieve >5x coverage for 50% of the genome was 0.03% (40 parasites per 200 white blood cells). Over 99% SNP concordance between VB and DBS samples was achieved after excluding missing calls. The sWGA methods described here provide a reliable and scalable way of generating P. falciparum genome sequence data from DBS samples. Our data indicate that it will be possible to get good quality sequence data on most if not all drug resistance loci from the majority of symptomatic malaria patients. This technique overcomes a major limiting factor in P. falciparum genome sequencing from field samples, and paves the way for large-scale epidemiological applications.",

    "abstract": "Numerous in vitro studies have yielded a refined picture of the structural and molecular associations between Cyclic-AMP receptor protein (Crp), the DNA motif, and RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme. In this study, high-resolution ChIP-exonuclease (ChIP-exo) was applied to study Crp binding in vivo and at genome-scale. Surprisingly, Crp was found to provide little to no protection of the DNA motif under activating conditions. Instead, Crp demonstrated binding patterns that closely resembled those generated by {sigma}70. The binding patterns of both Crp and {sigma}70 are indicative of RNAP holoenzyme DNA footprinting profiles associated with stages during transcription initiation that occur post-recruitment. This is marked by a pronounced advancement of the template strand footprint profile to the +20 position relative to the transcription start site and a multimodal distribution on the nontemplate strand. This trend was also observed in the familial transcription factor, Fnr, but full protection of the motif was seen in the repressor ArcA. Given the time-scale of ChIP studies and that the rate-limiting step in transcription initiation is typically post recruitment, we propose a hypothesis where Crp is absent from the DNA motif but remains associated with RNAP holoenzyme post-recruitment during transcription initiation. The release of Crp from the DNA motif may be a result of energetic changes that occur as RNAP holoenzyme traverses the various stable intermediates towards elongation complex formation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in genotyping and sequencing technologies have made detecting rare variants in large cohorts possible. Various analytic methods for associating disease to rare variants have been proposed, including burden tests, C-alpha and SKAT. Most of these methods, however, assume that samples come from a homogeneous population, which is not realistic for analyses of large samples. Not correcting for population stratification causes inflated p-values and false-positive associations. Here we propose a population-informed bootstrap resampling method that controls for population stratification (Bootstrat) in rare variant tests. In essence, the Bootstrat procedure uses genetic distance to create a phenotype probability for each sample. We show that this empirical approach can effectively correct for population stratification while maintaining statistical power comparable to established methods of controlling for population stratification. The Bootstrat scheme can be easily applied to existing rare variant testing methods with reasonable computational complexity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryRecent technology advances have enabled large-scale analysis of rare variants, but properly testing rare variants remains a significant challenge as most rare variant testing methods assume a sample of homogenous ethnicity, an assumption often not true for large cohorts. Failure to account for this heterogeneity increases the type I error rate. Here we propose a bootstrap scheme applicable to most existing rare variant testing methods to control for population heterogeneity. This scheme uses a randomization layer to establish a null distribution of the test statistics while preserving the sample genetic relationships. The null distribution is then used to calculate an empirical p-value that accounts for population heterogeneity. We demonstrate how this scheme successfully controls the type I error rate without loss of statistical power.",

    "abstract": "Myosins play countless critical roles in the cell, each requiring it to be activated at a specific location and time. To control myosin VI with this specificity, we created a novel optogenetic tool for activating myosin VI by fusing the light-sensitive Avena sativa phototropin1 LOV2 domain to a peptide from Dab2 (LOVDab), a myosin VI cargo protein. Our approach harnesses the native targeting and activation mechanism of myosin VI, allowing direct inferences on myosin VI function. LOVDab robustly recruits human full length myosin VI to various organelles in vivo and hinders peroxisome motion in a light-controllable manner. LOVDab also activates myosin VI in an in vitro gliding filament assay. Our data suggest that protein and lipid cargoes cooperate to activate myosin VI, allowing myosin VI to integrate Ca2+, lipid, and protein cargo signals in the cell to deploy in a site-specific manner.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMyosins are a broad class of motor proteins that generate force on actin filaments and fulfill contractile, transport, and anchoring roles. Myosin VI, the only myosin to walk toward the pointed end of actin filaments, is implicated in cancer metastasis and deafness. Intriguingly, myosin VI may play both transport and anchoring roles, depending upon where it is activated in the cell. Here we develop an optogenetic tool for studying myosin VI activation with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our approach photoactivates unmodified myosin VI through its native cargo pathway, enabling investigation of motor function and activation partners with minimal perturbation. This approach allows us to detect how and where myosin VI integrates multiple protein and second messenger signals to activate.",
