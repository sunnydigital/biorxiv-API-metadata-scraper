    "abstract": "Mathematical modeling of brain evolution is scarce, possibly due in part to the difficulty of describing how brain relates to fitness. Yet such modeling is needed to formalize verbal arguments and deepen our understanding of brain evolution. To address this issue, we combine elements of life history and metabolic theories to formulate a metabolically explicit mathematical model for brain life history evolution. We assume that some of the brains energetic expense is due to production (learning) and maintenance (memory) of skills (or cognitive abilities, knowledge, information, etc.). We also assume that individuals use skills to extract energy from the environment, and can allocate this energy to grow and maintain the body, including brain and reproductive tissues. Our model can be used to ask what fraction of growth energy should be allocated to the growth of brain and other tissues at each age under various biological settings as a result of natural selection. We apply the model to find uninvadable allocation strategies under a \\\"me-against-nature\\\" setting, namely when overcoming environmentally determined energy-extraction challenges does not involve any interactions with other individuals (possibly except caregivers), and using parameter values for modern humans. The uninvadable strategies yield predictions for brain and body mass throughout ontogeny, as well as for the ages at maturity, adulthood, and brain growth arrest. We find that (1) a me-against-nature setting is enough to generate adult brain and body mass of ancient human scale, (2) large brains are favored by intermediately challenging environments, moderately effective skills, and metabolically expensive memory, and (3) adult skill number is proportional to brain mass when metabolic costs of memory saturate the brain metabolic rate allocated to skills. Overall, our model is a step towards a quantitative theory of brain life history evolution yielding testable quantitative predictions as ecological, demographic, and social factors vary.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUnderstanding what promotes the evolution of a given feature is often helped by mathematical modeling. However, mathematical modeling of brain evolution has remained scarce, possibly because of difficulties describing mathematically how the brain relates to reproductive success, which is the currency of evolution. Here we combine elements of two research fields that have previously been successful at detailing how a feature impacts reproductive success (life history theory) and at predicting the individuals body mass throughout its life without the need to describe in detail the inner workings of the body (metabolic theory). We apply the model to a setting where individuals must extract energy from the environment without interacting with other individuals except caregivers (\\\"me-against-nature\\\") and parameterize the model with data from humans. In this setting, the model can correctly predict a variety of human features, including large brain sizes. Our model can be used to obtain testable quantitative predictions in terms of brain mass throughout an individuals life from assumed hypotheses promoting brain evolution, such as harsh environments or plentiful social interactions.",

    "abstract": "For the heterologous gene expression systems, the codon bias has to be optimized according to the host for efficient expression. Although DNA viruses show a correlation on codon bias with their hosts, HIV genes show low correlation for both nucleotide composition and codon usage bias with its human host which limits the efficient expression of HIV genes. Despite this variation, HIV is efficient at infecting hosts and multiplying in large number. In this study, first, the degree of codon adaptation is calculated as codon adaptation index (CAI) and compared with the expected threshold value (eCAI) determined from the sequences with the same nucleotide composition as that of the HIV-1 genome. Then, information theoretic analysis of nine genes of HIV-1 based on codon statistics of the HIV-1 genome, individual genes and codon usage of human genes is done. Comparison of codon adaptation indices with their respective threshold values shows that the CAI lies very close to the threshold values. Despite not being well adapted to the codon usage bias of human hosts, it was found that the Shannon entropies of the nine genes based on overall codon statistics of HIV-1 genome are very similar to the entropies calculated from codon usage of human genes. Similarly, for the HIV-1 genome sequence analyzed, the codon statistics of the third reading frame has the highest bias representing minimum entropy and hence the maximum information.",

    "abstract": "The rapid three-fold enlargement of the hominin brain1,2 began about 2.3 million years ago (myr) as Africa dried and grass replaced brush, creating great savannas3. Seeking an amplifying feedback loop, I analyzed the lightning-brush-fire ecology for grazing animals in a grassy burn scar4. Discovering the new grass by exploring brush byways could promote a population boom-but only after grass-specialized herbivores evolved from mixed feeders5 at 2.4 myr. When the brush returned several decades later, the grazer boom would turn to bust, squeezing numerous descendants back into the core grasslands. Meat-eating Homo species would boom and bust when grazers did, enriching the core in whatever alleles were earlier concentrated in the brush fringe catchment zone for that boom. This return migration for Homo is what creates the amplifying feedback loop that speeds brain enlargement rate, likely up to the mutation rate limit. It also promotes trait hitchhiking: any brush-relevant allele, not just those for hunting, can experience amplifying feedback merely by hanging out in the catchment zone4. The shade offered by brush would have been the default location for cooperative nurseries, time-consuming food preparation, and toolmaking. Increased behavioral versatility correlates with larger brain size and the more versatile brains of a current generation need only spend more-than-average time in the booms catchment zone for this recursive evolutionary process to keep average brain size increasing via assortative mating. This helps account for the time when enlargement began, why it was linear, when it ended, and why it slowed in Neanderthals and in Asian Homo erectus. Without utilizing Darwins selective survival, the feedback loop makes advance room for \\\"free\\\" future functionality in the cerebral cortex, likely relevant to the evolutionary emergence of our structured intellectual functions6 such as syntax, contingent planning, games, and logic.",

    "abstract": "Pairwise models are commonly used to describe many-species communities. In these models, a focal species receives additive fitness effects from pairwise interactions with other species in the community (\\\"pairwise additivity assumption\\\"), and all pairwise interactions are represented by a single canonical equation form (\\\"universality assumption\\\"). Here, we analyze the validity of pairwise modeling. We build mechanistic reference models for chemical-mediated interactions in microbial communities, and attempt to derive corresponding pairwise models. Even when one species affects another via a single chemical mediator, different forms of pairwise models are appropriate for consumable versus reusable mediators, with the wrong model producing qualitatively wrong predictions. For multi-mediator interactions, a canonical model becomes even less tenable. These results, combined with potential violation of the pairwise additivity assumption in communities of more than two species, suggest that although pairwise modeling can be useful, we should examine its validity before employing it.",

To test such \\\"geroprotective\\\" therapies in humans, surrogate endpoints are needed for extension of disease-free lifespan. Methods to quantify biological aging could provide such surrogate endpoints, but different methods have not been systematically evaluated in the same humans. We studied seven measures of biological aging in 964 middle-aged humans in the Dunedin Study: telomere-length, three epigenetic-clocks, and three biomarker-composites. Agreement between these different measures of biological aging was low. We also compared associations between biological aging measures and outcomes that geroprotective therapies will seek to modify: physical functioning, cognitive decline, and subjective signs of aging. The 71-CpG epigenetic clock and the biomarker composites were consistently related to these outcomes. Effect-sizes were modest. Quantification of biological aging is a young field. Next steps are to move toward systematic evaluation and refinement of methods.",

We insert GFP into the rigid head of the full integrin, model with Rosetta the orientation of GFP and its transition dipole relative to the integrin, and measure orientation with fluorescence polarization microscopy. Dependent on coupling to the cytoskeleton, integrins orient in the same direction as retrograde actin flow with their cytoskeleton-binding {beta}-subunits tilted by applied force. The measurements demonstrate that intracellular forces can orient cell surface integrins and support a molecular model of integrin activation by cytoskeletal force. We have developed a method that places atomic, ~[A] structures of cell surface receptors in the context of functional, cellular length-scale, ~m measurements and shows that rotation and tilt of cell surface receptors relative to the membrane plane can be restrained by interactions with other cellular components.",

    "abstract": "Trial-and-error learning requires evaluating variable actions and reinforcing successful variants. In songbirds, vocal exploration is induced by LMAN, the output of a basal ganglia-circuit that also contributes a corrective bias to the vocal output. This bias is gradually consolidated in RA, a motor cortex analogue downstream of LMAN. We develop a new model of such two-stage learning. Using stochastic gradient descent, we derive how the activity in  tutor circuits (e.g., LMAN) should match plasticity mechanisms in  student circuits (e.g., RA) to achieve efficient learning. We further describe a reinforcement learning framework through which the tutor can build its teaching signal. We show that mismatches between the tutor signal and the plasticity mechanism can impair learning. Applied to birdsong, our results predict the temporal structure of the corrective bias from LMAN given a plasticity rule in RA. Our framework can be applied predictively to other paired brain areas showing two-stage learning.",

In small populations, weakened selection against slightly-deleterious mutations results in an additional fitness reduction. Many studies have established that populations can evolve a reduced mutational load by evolving mutational robustness, but it is uncertain whether small populations can evolve a reduced susceptibility to drift-related fitness declines. Here, using mathematical modeling and digital experimental evolution, we show that small populations do evolve a reduced vulnerability to drift, or \\\"drift robustness\\\". We find that, compared to genotypes from large populations, genotypes from small populations have a decreased likelihood of small-effect deleterious mutations, thus causing small-population genotypes to be drift-robust. We further show that drift robustness is not adaptive, but instead arises because small populations preferentially adapt to drift-robust fitness peaks. These results have implications for genome evolution in organisms with small population sizes.",

    "abstract": "Sexual selection is well recognized as a driver of reproductive isolation between lineages. However, selection for increased reproductive isolation could reciprocally change the outcomes of sexual selection, when these processes share a genetic basis. Direct selection for reproductive isolation occurs in the context of  reinforcement, where selection acts to increase prezygotic barriers to reduce the cost of heterospecific matings. Many studies of reinforcement focus on premating reproductive barriers, however postmating traits-such as conspecific sperm precedence (CSP)-can also respond to reinforcing selection. We tested whether i) CSP responded to reinforcing selection, and ii) this response in sympatric populations altered intraspecific sperm competition (ISC) and the strength of sexual selection, with the sister species Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. We used sperm competition experiments to evaluate differences in CSP and ISC between two sympatric and two allopatric populations of D. pseudoobscura. Using multiple genotypes for each population allowed us to estimate not only patterns of phenotype divergence, but also the opportunity for sexual selection within each population. Consistent with a pattern of reinforcement, the sympatric populations had higher mean CSP. Moreover, ISC was altered in sympatric populations, where we observed decreased average offensive sperm competitive ability against conspecific males, allowing less opportunity for sexual selection to operate within these populations. These data demonstrate that strong reinforcing selection for reproductive isolation can have consequences for sexual selection and sexual interactions within species, in these important postmating sperm competition traits.",

    "abstract": "T cells must respond differently to antigens of varying affinity presented at different doses. Previous attempts to map pMHC affinity onto T cell responses have produced inconsistent patterns of responses preventing formulations of canonical models of T cell signalling. Here, a systematic analysis of T cell responses to 1,000,000-fold variations in both pMHC affinity and dose produced bell-shaped dose-response curves and different optimal pMHC affinities at different pMHC doses. Using sequential model rejection/identification algorithms, we identified a unique, minimal model of cellular signalling incorporating kinetic proofreading with limited signalling coupled to an incoherent feed forward loop (KPL-IFF), that reproduces these observations. We show that the KPL-IFF model correctly predicts the T cell response to antigen co-presentation. Our work offers a general approach for studying cellular signalling that does not require full details of biochemical pathways.\\n\\nSignificance statementT cells initiate and regulate adaptive immune responses when their T cell antigen receptors recognise antigens. The T cell response is known to depend on the antigen affinity/dose but the precise relationship, and the mechanisms underlying it, are debated. To resolve the debate, we stimulated T cells with antigens spanning a 1,000,000-fold range in affinity/dose. We found that a different antigen (and hence different affinity) produced the largest T cell response at different doses. Using model identification algorithms, we report a simple mechanistic model that can predict the T cell response from the physiological low affinity regime into the high affinity regime applicable to therapeutic receptors.",

    "abstract": "Integrins are transmembrane receptors that, upon activation, bind extracellular matrix (ECM) or cell surface ligands and link them to the actin cytoskeleton to mediate cell adhesion and migration1,2. One model for the structural transitions mediating integrin activation termed \\\"the cytoskeletal force hypothesis\\\" posits that force transmitted from the cytoskeleton to ligand-bound integrins acts as an allosteric stabilizer of the extended-open, high-affinity state3. Since cytoskeletal forces in migrating cells are generated by centripetal \\\"retrograde flow\\\" of F-actin from the cell leading edge, where integrin-based adhesions are initiated4,5, this model predicts that F-actin flow should align and orient activated, ligand-bound integrins in integrin-based adhesions. Here, polarization-sensitive fluorescence microscopy of GFP-V{beta}3 integrin chimeras in migrating fibroblasts shows that integrins are aligned with respect to the axis of FAs and the direction of F-actin flow, and this alignment requires binding immobilized ligand and talin-mediated linkage to a flowing cytoskeleton. Polarization imaging and Rosetta modelling of chimeras engineered to orient GFP differentially with respect to the integrin headpiece suggest that ligand-bound V{beta}3 integrin may be markedly tilted by the force of F-actin flow. These results show that actin cytoskeletal forces actively sculpt an anisotropic molecular scaffold in FAs that may underlie the ability of cells to sense directional ECM and physical cues.",

In Australia, we have observed an association between mosquitoes harboring the causative agent, Mycobacterium ulcerans, and BU.

Tails were exposed to mosquito (Aedes notoscriptus and Aedes aegypti) blood feeding or punctured with sterile needles. Two of 11 of mice with M. ulcerans contaminated tails exposed to feeding A. notoscriptus mosquitoes developed BU. Eighteen of 20 mice subjected to contaminated tail needle puncture developed BU. Mouse tails coated only in bacteria did not develop disease. We observed a low infectious dose-50 of four colony-forming units and a median incubation time of 12 weeks, consistent with data from human infections. We have uncovered a highly efficient and biologically plausible atypical transmission mode of BU via natural or anthropogenic skin punctures.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBuruli ulcer is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans. Unfortunately, how people contract this disease is not well understood. Here we show for the first time using experimental infections in mice that a very low dose of M. ulcerans delivered beneath the skin by a minor injury caused by a blood-feeding insect (mosquito) or a needle puncture is sufficient to cause Buruli ulcer.

The macaque VOF is compact and its fibers intertwine with the dorsal segment of the ILF, but the human VOF is much more elongated in the anterior-posterior direction and may be lateral to the ILF. These similarities and differences will be useful in establishing which circuitry in the macaque can serve as an accurate model for human visual cortex.\\n\\nContact informationHiromasa Takemura, Center for Information and Neural Networks (CiNet), National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, and Osaka University, Japan htakemur@nict.go.jp\\n\\nAuthor contributionDesigned the study: HT FP BAW.

    "abstract": "Decreasing federal and state support threaten long-term sustainability of research in publicly supported academic health centers. In weathering these financial threats, research at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) has undergone three substantial changes: (i) institutional salary support goes preferentially to senior faculty, while the young increasingly depend on grants; (ii) private and government support for research grows apace in clinical departments, but slowly declines in basic science departments; and (iii) research is judged more on its quantity (numbers of investigators and federal and private dollars) than on its goals, achievements, or scientific quality. We propose measures to alleviate these problems. Other large public academic health centers probably confront similar issues, but--except for UCSF--such centers have not been subjected to detailed public analysis.",
