    "abstract": "Axons are the cable-like protrusions of neurons which wire up the nervous system. Polar bundles of microtubules (MTs) constitute their structural backbones and are highways for life-sustaining transport between proximal cell bodies and distal synapses. Any morphogenetic changes of axons during development, plastic rearrangement, regeneration or degeneration depend on dynamic changes of these MT bundles. A key mechanism for implementing such changes is the coordinated polymerisation and depolymerisation at the plus ends of MTs within these bundles. To gain an understanding of how such regulation can be achieved at the cellular level, we provide here an integrated overview of the extensive knowledge we have about the molecular mechanisms regulating MT de/polymerisation. We first summarise insights gained from work in vitro, then describe the machinery which supplies the essential tubulin building blocks, the protein complexes associating with MT plus ends, and MT shaft-based mechanisms that influence plus end dynamics. We briefly summarise the contribution of MT plus end dynamics to important cellular functions in axons, and conclude by discussing the challenges and potential strategies of integrating the existing molecular knowledge into conceptual understanding at the level of axons.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is inherently noisy, but little is known about whether noise affects cell function or, if so, how and by how much. Here I present a theoretical framework to quantify the fitness costs of gene expression noise and identify the evolutionary and synthetic targets of noise control. I find that gene expression noise reduces fitness by slowing the average rate of nutrient uptake and protein synthesis. This is a direct consequence of the hyperbolic (Michaelis-Menten) kinetics of most biological reactions, which I show cause \\\"hyperbolic filtering\\\", a process that diminishes both the average rate and noise propagation of stochastic reactions. Interestingly, I find that transcriptional noise directly slows growth by slowing the average translation rate. Perhaps surprisingly, this is the largest fitness cost of transcriptional noise since translation strongly filters mRNA noise, making protein noise largely independent of transcriptional noise, consistent with empirical data. Translation, not transcription, then, is the primary target of protein noise control. Paradoxically, selection for protein-noise control favors increased ribosome-mRNA binding affinity, even though this increases translational bursting. However, I find that the efficacy of selection to suppress noise decays faster than linearly with increasing cell size. This predicts a stark, cell-size-mediated taxonomic divide in selection pressures for noise control: small unicellular species, including most prokaryotes, face fairly strong selection to suppress gene expression noise, whereas larger unicells, including most eukaryotes, experience extremely weak selection. I suggest that this taxonomic discrepancy in selection efficacy contributed to the evolution of greater gene-regulatory complexity in eukaryotes.\\n\\nARTICLE SUMMARYGene expression is a probabilistic process, resulting in random variation in mRNA and protein abundance among cells called \\\"noise\\\". Understanding how noise affects cell function is a major problem in biology. Here I present theory demonstrating that gene expression noise slows the average rate of cell division. Furthermore, by modeling stochastic gene expression with non-linearity, I identify novel mechanisms of cellular robustness. However, I find that the cost of noise, and therefore the strength of selection favoring robustness, decays faster than linearly with increasing cell size. This may help explain the vast differences in gene-regulatory complexity between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "1Developmental improvements in working memory are important in the acquisition of new skills, like reading and maths. Current accounts of the brain systems supporting working memory rarely take development into account. However, understanding the development of these skills, and in turn where this development can go awry, will require more sophsiticated neuropsychological accounts that fully consider the role of development. The current study investigated how structural brain correlates of components of the working memory system change over developmental time. Verbal and visuospatial short-term and working memory were assessed in 153 children between 6 and 16 years and latent components of the working memory system were derived using principal component analysis. Further, fractional anisotropy and cortical thickness maps were derived from T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI and processed using eigenanatomy decomposition, an advanced dimensionality reduction method for neuroimaging data. We were then able to explore how the structural brain correlates of working memory gradually shifted across childhood. Regression modelling indicated greater involvement of the corpus callosum and posterior temporal white matter in younger children for performance associated with the executive part of the working memory system, while thickness of the occipitotemporal cortex was more predictive in older children. These findings are consistent with an account in which increasing specialisation leads to shifts in the contribution of neural substrates over developmental time, from early reliance on a distributed system supported by long-range connections to later reliance on specialised local circuitry. Furthemore, our findings emphasise the importance of taking development into account when considering the neural systems that support complex cognitive skills, like working memory.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between two different linear dimensions of the chamber (ventricle) and the two respective values of the force of contraction (which are applied to the imaginary piston in order to accelerate the initial venous inflow) is deduced as the ratio of forces which is equal to the ratio of squares of linear dimensions of the chamber; the equation is valid when the durations of both contractions (systoles) are identical. The relationship corresponds to Frank-Starling law (the right limb of parabola can be approximated to the direct proportionality of the law). When the durations of systoles are different the ratio of forces is equal to the inverse ratio of durations of systoles; the inverse proportionality permits to interpret the Bowditch phenomenon by means of the ascending asymptote of hyperbole. Stepwise shortening of systole is impossible due to extremely narrow range of variable (duration of systole), hence the shift of variable can be realized only as a leap; this leap is accompanied by the enormous rise of function (force of contraction) which can be accommodated to several contractions. Homoiometric regulation can be considered a safety device (presumably in the form of paroxysmal tachycardia with the shortened systole) in the case when heterometric regulation lacks to produce the adequate force of contraction in response to excessively distended chamber.",

However, little is known about the function and profile of lncRNAs in preadipocytes differentiation of chicken. Here, we identified lncRNAs in preadipocytes of different differentiation stages by RNA-sequencing using Jinghai Yellow chicken. A total of 1,300,074,528 clean reads and 27,023 lncRNAs were obtained from twenty samples. 3095 genes (1,336 lncRNAs and 1,759 mRNAs) were differentially expressed among different stages, of which the number of DEGs decreased with the differentiation, demonstrating that the early stage might be most important for chicken preadipocytes differentiation. Furthermore, 3,095 DEGs were clustered into 8 clusters with their expression patterns by K-means clustering. We identified six stage-specific modules related to A0, A2 and A6 stages using weighted co-expression network analysis. Many well-known/novel pathways associated with preadipocytes differentiation were found. We also identified highly connected genes in each module and visualized them by cytoscape. Many well-known genes related to preadipocytes differentiation were found such as IGFBP2 and JUN. Yet, the majority of high connected genes were unknown in chicken preadipocytes. This study provides a valuable resource for chicken lncRNA study and contributes to batter understanding the biology of preadipocytes differentiation in chicken.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the rates at which bacterial genomes evolve is critical to understanding major evolutionary and ecological processes such as disease emergence, long-term host-pathogen associations, and short-term transmission patterns. The surge in bacterial genomic data sets provides a new opportunity to estimate these rates and reveal the factors that shape bacterial evolutionary dynamics. For many organisms estimates of evolutionary rate display an inverse association with the time-scale over which the data are sampled. However, this relationship remains unexplored in bacteria due to the difficulty in estimating genome-wide evolutionary rates, which are impacted by the extent of temporal structure in the data and the prevalence of recombination. We collected 36 whole genome sequence data sets from 16 species of bacterial pathogens to systematically estimate and compare their evolutionary rates and assess the extent of temporal structure in the absence of recombination. The majority (28/36) of data sets possessed sufficient clock-like structure to robustly estimate evolutionary rates. However, in some species reliable estimates were not possible even with \\\"ancient DNA\\\" data sampled over many centuries, suggesting that they evolve very slowly or that they display extensive rate variation among lineages. The robustly estimated evolutionary rates spanned several orders of magnitude, from 10-6 to 10-8 nucleotide substitutions site-1 year-1. This variation was largely attributable to sampling time, which was strongly negatively associated with estimated evolutionary rates, with this relationship best described by an exponential decay curve. To avoid potential estimation biases such time-dependency should be considered when inferring evolutionary time-scales in bacteria.",

Minor but significant variations in the architecture are seen between cell types/functional states. The architecture and the DNA sequence show very similar fine-structured multi-scaling behaviour confirming their co-evolution and the above. This architecture, its dynamics, and accessibility balance stability and flexibility ensuring genome integrity and variation enabling gene expression/regulation by self-organization of (in)active units already in proximity. Our results agree with the heuristics of the field and allow \\\"architectural sequencing\\\" at a genome mechanics level to understand the inseparable systems genomic properties.",

High measurement density and single cell resolution provide a powerful tool for large-scale multiparameter growth analysis based on the modeling of microcolony expansion on solid media. Pioneered in yeast but applicable to other colony forming organisms, ODELAY extracts the three key growth parameters (lag time, doubling time, and carrying capacity) that define microcolony expansion from single cells, simultaneously permitting the assessment of population heterogeneity. The utility of ODELAY is illustrated using yeast mutants, revealing a spectrum of phenotypes arising from single and combinatorial growth parameter perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we found anovulation in nuclear progestin receptor (Pgr) knockout (Pgr-KO) zebrafish, which offers a new model for examining Pgr regulated genes and pathways that are important for ovulation and fertility. In this study, we examined expression of all transcripts using RNA-Seq in pre-ovulatory follicular cells collected after the final oocyte maturation, but prior to ovulation, from wild-type (WT) or Pgr-KO fish. Differential expression analysis revealed 2,888 genes significantly differentially expressed between WT and Pgr-KO fish. Among those, 1,230 gene transcripts were significantly more expressed, while 1,658 genes were significantly less expressed in WT than those in Pgr-KO. We then retrieved and compared transcriptional data from online databases and further identified 661 conserved genes in fish, mice, and humans, that showed similar levels of high (283 genes) or low (387) expression in animals that were ovulating compared to those with no ovulation. For the first time, ovulatory genes and their involved biological processes and pathways were also visualized using Enrichment Map and Cytoscape. Intriguingly, enrichment analysis indicated the genes with higher expression were involved in multiple ovulatory pathways and processes such as inflammatory response, angiogenesis, cytokine production, cell migration, chemotaxis, MAPK, focal adhesion, and cytoskeleton reorganization. In contrast, the genes with lower expression were mainly involved DNA replication, DNA repair, DNA methylation, RNA processing, telomere maintenance, spindle assembling, nuclear acid transport, catabolic processes, nuclear and cell division. Our results indicate that a large set of genes (>3,000) are differentially regulated in the follicular cells in zebrafish prior to ovulation, terminating programs including growth and proliferation, and beginning processes including the inflammatory response and apoptosis. Further studies are required to establish relationships among these genes and an ovulatory circuit in zebrafish model.",

Here we address this using large whole genome sequence datasets representing six diverse bacterial species; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Excluding M. tuberculosis, we find that a high proportion (62%-79%; mean 70%) of intergenic sites are selectively constrained, relative to synonymous sites. Non-coding RNAs tend to be under stronger selective constraint than promoters, which in turn are typically more constrained than rho-independent terminators. Even when these regulatory elements are excluded, the mean proportion of constrained intergenic sites only falls to 69%; thus our current understanding of the functionality of intergenic regions (IGRs) in bacteria is severely limited. Consistent with a role for positive as well as negative selection on intergenic sites, we present evidence for strong positive selection in Mycobacterium tuberculosis promoters, underlining the key role of regulatory changes as an adaptive mechanism in this highly monomorphic pathogen.",

However, most of the methodologies introduced so far suffer from spurious inference of the disease-causing sites due to population inhomogeneities. In this paper, we introduce a statistical framework to compensate for this shortcoming by equipping the current methodologies with a state-of-the-art clustering algorithm being widely used in population genetics applications. The proposed framework jointly infers the disease causal factors and the hidden population structures. In this regard, a Markov Chain-Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure has been employed to assess the posterior probability distribution of the model parameters. We have implemented our proposed framework on a software package whose performance is extensively evaluated on a number of synthetic datasets, and compared to some of the well-known existing methods such as STRUCTURE. It has been shown that in extreme scenarios, up to 10 - 15% of improvement in the inference accuracy is achieved with a moderate increase in computational complexity.",

    "abstract": "Complex patterns of neural activity appear during up-states in the neocortex and sharp waves in the hippocampus, including sequences that resemble those during prior behavioral experience. The mechanisms underlying this replay are not well understood. How can small synaptic footprints engraved by experience control large-scale network activity during memory retrieval and consolidation? We hypothesize that sparse and weak synaptic connectivity between Hebbian assemblies are boosted by pre-existing recurrent connectivity within them. To investigate this idea, we connect sequences of assemblies in randomly connected spiking neuronal networks with a balance of excitation and inhibition. Simulations and analytical calculations show that recurrent connections within assemblies allow for a fast amplification of signals that indeed reduces the required number of inter-assembly connections. Replay can be evoked by small sensory-like cues or emerge spontaneously by activity fluctuations. Global--potentially neuromodulatory--alterations of neuronal excitability can switch between network states that favor retrieval and consolidation.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySynaptic plasticity is the basis for learning and memory, and many experiments indicate that memories are imprinted in synaptic connections. However, basic mechanisms of how such memories are retrieved and consolidated remain unclear. In particular, how can one-shot learning of a sequence of events achieve a sufficiently strong synaptic footprint to retrieve or replay this sequence? Using both numerical simulations of spiking neural networks and an analytic approach, we provide a biologically plausible model for understanding how minute synaptic changes in a recurrent network can nevertheless be retrieved by small cues or even manifest themselves as activity patterns that emerge spontaneously. We show how the retrieval of exceedingly small changes in the connections across assemblies is robustly facilitated by recurrent connectivity within assemblies. This interaction between recurrent amplification within an assembly and the feed-forward propagation of activity across the network establishes a basis for the retrieval of memories.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is increasingly used to study gene expression at the level of individual cells. However, preparing raw sequence data for further analysis is not a straightforward process. Biases, artifacts, and other sources of unwanted variation are present in the data, requiring substantial time and effort to be spent on pre-processing, quality control (QC) and normalisation.\\n\\nResultsWe have developed the R/Bioconductor package scater to facilitate rigorous pre-processing, quality control, normalisation and visualisation of scRNA-seq data. The package provides a convenient, flexible workflow to process raw sequencing reads into a high-quality expression dataset ready for downstream analysis. scater provides a rich suite of plotting tools for single-cell data and a flexible data structure that is compatible with existing tools and can be used as infrastructure for future software development.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe open-source code, along with installation instructions, vignettes and case studies, is available through Bioconductor at http://bioconductor.org/packages/scater.\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary material is available online at bioRxiv accompanying this manuscript, and all materials required to reproduce the results presented in this paper are available at dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.60139.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomics has become an integral part of defining microbial diversity in various environments. Many ecosystems have characteristically low biomass and few cultured representatives. Linking potential metabolisms to phylogeny in environmental microorganisms is important for interpreting microbial community functions and the impacts these communities have on geochemical cycles. However, with metagenomic studies there is the computational hurdle of  binning contigs into phylogenetically related units or putative genomes. Binning methods have been implemented with varying approaches such as k-means clustering, Gaussian mixture models, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and two-way clustering; however, many of these suffer from biases against low coverage/abundance organisms and closely related taxa/strains. We are introducing a new binning method, BinSanity, that utilizes the clustering algorithm affinity propagation (AP), to cluster assemblies using coverage alone, removing potential composition based biases in clustering contigs, but requires a minimum of two samples. To increase fidelity, a refinement script was developed that uses composition data (tetranucleotide frequency and %G+C content) to refine bins containing multiple source organisms. This separation of composition and coverage based signatures reduces clustering bias for closely related taxa. BinSanity was developed and tested on artificial metagenomes varying in size and complexity. Results indicate that this implementation of AP lead to a higher precision, recall, and Adjusted Rand Index over five commonly implemented methods. When tested on a previously published infant gut metagenome, BinSanity generated high completion and low redundancy bins corresponding with the published metagenome-assembled genomes.",
