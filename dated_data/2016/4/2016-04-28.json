    "abstract": "MotivationNext generation sequencing technologies have provided us with a wealth of information on genetic variation, but predicting the functional significance of this variation is a difficult task. While many comparative genomics studies have focused on gene flux and large scale changes, relatively little attention has been paid to quantifying the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels on protein function, particularly in bacterial genomics.\\n\\nResultsWe present a hidden Markov model based approach we call delta-bitscore (DBS) for identifying orthologous proteins that have diverged at the amino acid sequence level in a way that is likely to impact biological function. We benchmark this approach with several widely used datasets and apply it to a proof-of-concept study of orthologous proteomes in an investigation of host adaptation in Salmonella enterica. We highlight the value of the method in identifying functional divergence of genes, and suggest that this tool may be a better approach than the commonly used dN/dS metric for identifying functionally significant genetic changes occurring in recently diverged organisms.\\n\\nAvailabilityA program implementing DBS for pairwise genome comparisons is freely available at: https://github.com/UCanCompBio/deltaBS.\\n\\nContactnicole.wheeler@pg.canterbury.ac.nz, lars.barquist@uni-wuerzburg.de\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at BioRxiv online.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHow does cortical state affect neural responses to naturalistic stimuli, and is it analogous between anesthetized and awake animals? We recorded spikes and local field potential (LFP) from all layers of isoflurane-anesthetized cat primary visual cortex (V1) while repeatedly presenting wide-field natural scene movie clips. Spiking responses of single units were remarkably precise, reliable and sparse, with lognormally distributed mean firing rates. Many units had distinct barcode-like firing patterns, with features as little as 10 ms wide. LFP-derived cortical state switched spontaneously between synchronized (1/f) and desynchronized (broadband). Surprisingly, responses were more precise, reliable and sparse during the synchronized than desynchronized state. Because the desynchronized state under anesthesia is thought to correspond to attending periods in awake animals, during which responses are enhanced, our results complicate the analogy between cortical states in anesthetized and awake animals. The presenceof orientation maps in cat V1 may explain contrary reports in anesthetized rodents, and predicts a similar result in anesthetized ferret and primate V1.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGlobal brain activity changes spontaneously over time and can be characterized along a spectrum from slow synchronized activity, to fast desynchronized activity. This spectrum is similar in awake, asleep and anesthetized animals, but is its effect on neural responses the same in all cases? Here we show that neural responses to natural movies in anesthetized cat visual cortex are more precise during synchronized activity. This is contrary to reports in anesthetized rodents, which we suggest may be due to greater columnar organization in cat visual cortex. Since this is also contrary to enhanced responses and behavioural performance during attention, when activity is desynchronized, our results suggest that similar brain states in awake and anesthetized animals may not be functionally analogous.",

    "abstract": "As a result of a high rate of mutations and recombination events, an RNA-virus exists as a heterogeneous \\\"swarm\\\". The ability of next-generation sequencing to produce massive quantities of genomic data inexpensively has allowed virologists to study the structure of viral populations from an infected host at an unprecedented resolution. However, high similarity and low frequency of the viral variants impose a huge challenge to assembly of individual full-length genomes. The long read length offered by a single-molecule sequencing technologies allows each mutant variant to be sequenced in a single pass. However, high error rate limits the ability to reconstruct heterogeneous viral population composed of rare, related mutant variants. In this paper, we present 2SNV, a method able to tolerate the high error-rate of the single-molecule protocol and reconstruct mutant variants. The proposed protocol is able to eliminate sequencing errors and reconstruct closely related viral mutant variants. 2SNV uses linkage between single nucleotide variations to efficiently distinguish them from read errors. To benchmark the sensitivity of 2SNV, we performed a single-molecule sequencing experiment on a sample containing a titrated level of known viral mutant variants.\\n\\nOur method is able to accurately reconstruct clone with frequency of 0.2% and distinguish clones that differed in only two nucleotides distantly located on the genome. 2SNV outperforms existing methods for full-length viral mutant reconstruction. With a high sensitivity and accuracy, 2SNV is anticipated to facilitate not only viral quasispecies reconstruction, but also other biological questions that require detection of rare haplotypes such as genetic diversity in cancer cell population, and monitoring B-cell and T-cell receptor repertoire.

    "abstract": "Broad transcriptomic sequencing of eukaryotes has revealed the ubiquity of splicing of nuclear genes. While the vast majority of splicing events join segments of the same RNA transcript, various studies have found a few intriguing cases of trans-splicing of introns, in which splicing events within protein coding regions join segments of different RNA transcripts. The most structurally intricate case known involves the bursicon gene in mosquitos, in which an internal exon is encoded at a distinct locus, requiring multiple trans-splicing events form the mature mRNA. This arrangement is known to be ancestral to mosquitos, however the exact timing of the origin of trans-splicing and the history of the bursicon gene within mosquitos is unknown. Taking advantage of the recent availability of genomes from various Anopheles mosquitos and from relatives of mosquitos, I determined trans versus cis encoding of bursicon across Culicomorpha. I conclude that trans-splicing emerged in the last common ancestor of mosquitos, and that trans-splicing has been retained in all 19 studied Anopheles species. The retention of trans-splicing could indicate functional importance of this arrangement, or could alternatively reflect the rarity of mutations giving rise to viable allelic alternatives.",

Profiles of cell populations treated with different experimental perturbations can be compared to suit many goals, such as identifying the phenotypic impact of chemical or genetic perturbations, grouping compounds and/or genes into functional pathways, and identifying signatures of disease.

    "abstract": "Mutualistic interactions can be stabilized against invasion by non-cooperative individuals by putting such \\\"cheaters\\\" at a selective disadvantage. Selection against cheaters should eliminate genetic variation in partner quality -- yet such variation is often found in natural populations. One explanation for this paradox is that mutualism outcomes are determined not only by responses to partner performance, but also by partner signals. Here, we build a model of coevolution in a symbiotic mutualism, in which hosts ability to sanction non-cooperative symbionts and recognition of symbiont signals are determined by separate loci, as are symbionts cooperation and expression of signals. In the model, variation persists without destabilizing the interaction, in part because coevolution of symbiont signals and host recognition is altered by the coevolution of sanctions and cooperation, and vice-versa. Individual-based simulations incorporating population structure strongly corroborate these results. The dual systems of sanctions and partner recognition converge toward conditions similar to some economic models of mutualistic symbiosis in which hosts offering the right incentives to potential symbionts can initiate symbiosis without screening for partner quality. These results predict that mutualists can maintain variation in recognition of partner signals or in the ability to sanction non-cooperators without destabilizing mutualism, and reinforce the notion that studies of mutualism should consider communication between partners as well as the exchange of benefits.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale identification of transcription start sites (TSSs) using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) has yielded insight into promoter location, architecture, and regulation for a small set of taxa representing major model organisms, including human. However, comparative and evolutionary genomics studies of cis-regulatory control of transcription initiation for a wider spectrum of Metazoa are still outstanding. To broaden our understanding of core promoter structure in species from metazoan clades with currently scant genome data, we sought to characterize the landscape of cis-regulatory elements in the microcrustacean water flea Daphnia pulex, an important model organism for studies in ecology, toxicology, and genetics. We performed CAGE from total RNA derived from three states: sexual females, asexual females, and males, reflecting distinct sexes and modes of reproduction. We mapped over 120 million CAGE reads to the D. pulex genome and generated a Daphnia promoter atlas containing 12,662 unique promoters. Characterization of the transcription initiation sites showed the expected enrichment of the CA-dinucleotide at TSSs [-1,1] (associated with Initiator-motif containing promoters) but also significant over-representation of GN-dinucleotides. Overall, these data suggest that D. pulex initiation sites are among the most GC-rich yet observed in metazoans. Computational de novo motif discovery around CAGE-identified TSSs revealed eight putative core promoter elements, including the canonical TATA (TATAWAA) and Initiator (CAGWY) motifs, as well as statistically significant motifs with no obvious orthologs in other metazoans. Analysis of the differentially-expressed genes suggests that a considerable number of cell cycle genes (each with net negative regulatory effects on meiosis) are upregulated in asexual females, providing a glimpse of the molecular events that underpin the cyclical parthenogenesis in D. pulex. Taken together, this work provides the first picture of transcription initiation and promoter architecture within Crustacea. The Daphnia promoter atlas we present here provides a basis for future study among Daphnia spp. as well as for comparative genomic analyses of metazoan transcriptional control.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the effects of demographic structure on evolutionary dynamics, when selection acts on reproduction, survival, or both. In contrast with the previously discovered pattern that the fixation probability of a neutral mutant decreases while population becomes younger, we show that a mutant with constant selective advantage may have a maximum or a minimum of the fixation probability in populations with an intermediate fraction of young individuals. This highlights the importance of life history and demographic structure in studying evolutionary dynamics. We also illustrate the fundamental differences between selection on reproduction and on survival when age structure is present. In addition, we evaluate the relative importance of size and structure of the population in determining the fixation probability of the mutant. Our work lays the foundation for studying also density and frequency dependent effects in populations when demographic structures cannot be neglected.",

Here we identify in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) - a prefrontal region involved in choice and decision-making - a mechanism that explains individual preferences in rats between cocaine use and an alternative, nondrug action. We found that initiation of these actions is selectively encoded by two non-overlapping populations of OFC neurons, and that the relative size and differential pre-choice activity of the cocaine action-coding population determine an individual preference, a larger size and a higher pre-choice activity being associated with cocaine preference. A larger size is a structural feature that may confer to a population of OFC neurons a competitive advantage during choice in favor of the encoded action. Such structural encoding also explains two other major defining features of an individual drug preference, its stability over time and its resistance to change.",

In the mouse, limb bud restricted spatiotemporal expression of Shh occurs from ~E10-E11.5 at the distal posterior margin and is essential for correct autopod formation. Here, we have analysed the higher-order chromatin conformation of Shh in expressing and non-expressing tissues, both by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and by chromosome conformation capture (5C). Conventional and super-resolution light microscopy identified significantly elevated frequencies of Shh/ZRS co-localisation only in the Shh expressing regions of the limb bud. However, Shh-ZRS spatial distances were consistently shorter than intervening distances to a neural enhancer in all tissues and developmental stages analysed. 5C identified a topologically associating domain (TAD) over the Shh/ZRS genomic region and enriched interactions between Shh and ZRS throughout E11.5 embryos. Shh/ZRS co-localisation, therefore, correlates with the spatiotemporal domain of limb bud-specific Shh expression, but close Shh/ZRS proximity in the nucleus occurs regardless of whether the gene or enhancer is active. We suggest that this constrained chromatin configuration optimises the opportunity for the active enhancer to locate and instigate Shh expression.",

    "abstract": "Given the intricacies of the retinal neural circuit, which bears a striking resemblance to that of the brain, it is proposed that retinal function goes beyond mere spatiotemporal prefiltering. We hypothesise that aspects related to motion detection and discrimination, anticipation and adaptation to environmental and contextual conditions, which have traditionally been ascribed to the brain, may be supported by neurons in the retina. Such early computations may be dependent on compensative and adaptive mechanisms that stem from qualities intrinsic to the retinal neural circuit and its interaction with the environment (neural transduction time, connectivity patterns, regularities in the input signal, temporal dynamics and light variations).\\n\\nWith a view to investigating the contribution of the photoreceptor population to the processing performed by the retina in natural scotopic conditions, we present a continuous model of the rod photoreceptor. Our model permits the reproduction and exploration of a set of qualitative features displayed in vitro, such as excitation-dependent activation level and time-to-membrane current integration. We captured qualitative aspects of key features selected for their presumed importance in early visual function. Further, we subjected our model to extensive parameter sensitivity analyses, aiming to provide a visual representation of their contribution to the observed qualitative behavior.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPrimate rod photoreceptor cells constitute the very first processing step in retinal function. This layer influences most of the visual field and presents itself as a tightly packed photosensitive array. Yet, no computational formulation of this neuron is suited for large-scale, time continuous modeling.

    "abstract": "Recombineering, the use of endogenous homologous recombination systems to recombine DNA in vivo, is a commonly used technique for genome editing in microbes. Recombineering has not yet been developed for animals, where non-homology-based mechanisms have been thought to dominate DNA repair. Here, we demonstrate that homology-dependent repair (HDR) is robust in C. elegans using linear templates with short homologies (~35 bases). Templates with homology to only one side of a double-strand break initiate repair efficiently, and short overlaps between templates support template switching. We demonstrate the use of single-stranded, bridging oligonucleotides (ssODNs) to target PCR fragments precisely to DSBs induced by CRISPR/Cas9 on chromosomes. Based on these findings, we develop recombineering strategies for genome editing that expand the utility of ssODNs and eliminate in vitro cloning steps for template construction. We apply these methods to the generation of GFP knock-in alleles and gene replacements without co-integrated markers. We conclude that, like microbes, metazoans possess robust homology-dependent repair mechanisms that can be harnessed for recombineering and genome editing.",

    "abstract": "The rates at which lesions are removed by DNA repair can vary widely throughout the genome with important implications for genomic stability. To study this, we measured the distribution of nucleotide excision repair (NER) rates for UV-induced lesions throughout the budding yeast genome. By plotting these repair rates in relation to genes and their associated flanking sequences, we reveal that in normal cells, genomic repair rates display a distinctive pattern, suggesting that DNA repair is highly organised within the genome. Furthermore, by comparing genome-wide DNA repair rates in wild-type cells, and cells defective in the global genome-NER (GG-NER) sub-pathway, we establish how this alters the distribution of NER rates throughout the genome. We also examined the genomic locations of GG-NER factor binding to chromatin before and after UV irradiation revealing that GG-NER is organised and initiated from specific genomic locations. At these sites, chromatin occupancy of the histone acetyl transferase Gcn5 is controlled by the GG-NER complex, which regulates histone H3 acetylation and chromatin structure, thereby promoting efficient DNA repair of UV-induced lesions. Chromatin remodeling during the GG-NER process is therefore organized into these genomic domains. Importantly, loss of Gcn5, significantly alters the genomic distribution of NER rates, a finding that has important implications for the effects of chromatin modifiers on the distribution of mutations that arise throughout the genome.",

    "abstract": "Biological predispositions influence approach and avoid responses since the beginning of life. Neonates of species that require parental care (e.g. human babies and chicks of the domestic fowl) are attracted by stimuli associated with animate social partners, such as face-like configurations, biological motion and self-propulsion. The property of being filled is used as a cue of animacy by 8-month-old infants but it is not known whether this reflects the effect of previous experience. We use chicks of the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus) to investigate whether the property of being filled vs. hollow elicits spontaneous or learned preferences. To this aim we tested preferences of naIve and imprinted chicks for hollow and closed cylinders. Contrary to our expectations, we documented an unlearned attraction for hollow stimuli. The preference for hollow stimuli decreased when chicks were imprinted on filled stimuli but did not increase when chicks were imprinted on hollow stimuli, suggesting that this feature is not crucial to categorize the familiarity of imprinting objects. When chicks were imprinted on occluded stimuli that could be either filled or hollow, the preference for hollow stimuli emerged again, showing that imprinting does not disrupt the spontaneous preference for hollow objects. Further experiments revealed that hollow objects were mainly attractive by means of depth cues such as darker innards, more than as places to hide or as objects with high contrast. Our findings point to predisposed preferences for hollow objects that might be unrelated to social behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Urban areas are a new and increasingly dominant feature of terrestrial landscapes that dramatically alter environments. It is unclear whether wild populations can adapt to the unique challenges presented by urbanization. To address this problem, we sampled the frequency of a Mendelian-inherited trait--cyanogenesis--in white clover (Trifolium repens L.) plants along urbanization gradients in four large cities. Cyanogenesis protects plants from herbivores, but also reduces freezing tolerance. Plants evolved reduced cyanogenesis with increasing proximity to the urban center in three of the four cities. In an experiment, we demonstrate that gradients in herbivore pressure do not cause these clines. Instead, urban areas experience relatively cold minimum winter ground temperatures because of reduced snow cover within cities, which selects against cyanogenesis. Together, our study demonstrates that wild populations exhibit parallel adaptive evolution in response to urbanization, which likely facilitates the persistence of these plants and promotes pollinator abundance and diversity.",

One important problem is automatically detecting the cellular compartment where a fluorescently tagged protein resides, a task relatively simple for an experienced human, but difficult to automate on a computer. Here, we train an 11-layer neural network on data from mapping thousands of yeast proteins, achieving per cell localization classification accuracy of 91%, and per protein accuracy of 99% on held out images. We confirm that low-level network features correspond to basic image characteristics, while deeper layers separate localization classes. Using this network as a feature calculator, we train standard classifiers that assign proteins to previously unseen compartments after observing only a small number of training examples. Our results are the most accurate subcellular localization classifications to date, and demonstrate the usefulness of deep learning for high throughput microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Specific protein-protein interactions are crucial in the cell, both to ensure the formation and stability of multi-protein complexes, and to enable signal transduction in various pathways. Functional interactions between proteins result in coevolution between the interaction partners. Hence, the sequences of interacting partners are correlated. Here we exploit these correlations to accurately identify which proteins are specific interaction partners from sequence data alone. Our general approach, which employs a pairwise maximum entropy model to infer direct couplings between residues, has been successfully used to predict the three-dimensional structures of proteins from sequences. Building on this approach, we introduce an iterative algorithm to predict specific interaction partners from among the members of two protein families. We assess the algorithm's performance on histidine kinases and response regulators from bacterial two-component signaling systems. The algorithm proves successful without any a priori knowledge of interaction partners, yielding a striking 0.93 true positive fraction on our complete dataset, and we uncover the origin of this surprising success. Finally, we discuss how our method could be used to predict novel protein-protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "Gene gains and losses shape the gene complement of animal lineages and are a fundamental aspect of genomic evolution. Acquiring a comprehensive view of the evolution of gene repertoires is however limited by the intrinsic limitations of common sequence similarity searches and available databases. Thus, a subset of the complement of an organism consists of hidden orthologs, those with no apparent homology with common sequenced animal lineages --mistakenly considered new genes-- but actually representing fast evolving orthologs of presumably lost proteins. Here, we describe 'Leapfrog', an automated pipeline that uses increased taxon sampling to overcome long evolutionary distances and identify hidden orthologs in large transcriptomic databases. As a case study, we used 35 transcriptomes of 29 flatworm lineages to recover 3,597 hidden orthologs. Unexpectedly, we do not observe a correlation between the number of hidden orthologs in a lineage and its 'average' evolutionary rate. Hidden orthologs do not show unusual sequence composition biases (e.g. GC content, average length, domain composition), but do appear to be more common in genes with binding or catalytic activity. By using 'Leapfrog', we identify key centrosome-related genes and homeodomain classes previously reported as absent in free-living flatworms, e.g. planarians. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that hidden orthologs comprise a significant proportion of the gene repertoire, qualifying the impact of gene losses and gains in gene complement evolution.",

    "abstract": "Empathy is the ability to recognize and respond to the emotional states of other individuals. It is an important psychological process that facilitates navigating social interactions and maintaining relationships, which are important for wellbeing. Several psychological studies have identified difficulties in both self-report and performance-based measures of empathy in a range of psychiatric conditions. To date, no study has systematically investigated the genetic architecture of empathy using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we report the results of the largest GWAS of empathy to date using a well-validated self-report measure of empathy, the Empathy Quotient (EQ), in 46,861 research participants from 23andMe, Inc. We identify 11 suggestive loci (P < 1x10-6), though none were significant at P < 2.5x10-8 after correcting for multiple testing. The most significant SNP was identified in the non-stratified analysis (rs4882760; P = 4.29x10-8), and is an intronic SNP in TMEM132C. The EQ had a modest but significant narrow-sense heritability (0.11{+/-}0.014; P = 1.7x10-14). As predicted, based on earlier work, we confirmed a significant female-advantage on the EQ (P < 2x10-16 Cohens d = 0.65). We identified similar SNP heritability and high genetic correlation between the sexes. Also, as predicted, we identified a significant negative genetic correlation between autism and the EQ (rg = -0.27{+/-}0.07, P = 1.63x10-4). We also identified a significant positive genetic correlation between the EQ and risk for schizophrenia (rg = 0.19{+/-}0.04; P= 1.36x10-5), risk for anorexia nervosa (rg = 0.32{+/-}0.09; P = 6x10-4), and extraversion (rg = 0.45{+/-}0.08; 5.7x10-8). This is the first GWAS of self-reported empathy. The results suggest that the genetic variations associated with empathy also play a role in psychiatric conditions and psychological traits.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has emerged as a powerful technique enabling spatially defined imaging of metabolites within microbial biofilms. Here, we extend this approach to enable differentiation of newly synthesized versus pre-existing metabolites across a co-culture. This is accomplished by MS imaging two soil microbes, Shewanella oneidensis MR1 and Pseudomonas stutzeri RCH2, that were administered heavy water (D2O) during growth on agar plates. For two species-specific diglyceride (DG) lipids, isotopic analysis was performed on each spectra collected across the co-culture to determine the relative amount of newly synthesized versus pre-existing lipid. Here, highest levels of new synthesis of RCH2 lipid was localized to border regions adjacent to S. oneidensis MR1, while the MR1 lipid showed highest levels in regions further from RCH2. Interestingly, regions of high lipid abundance did not correspond to the regions with highest new lipid biosynthesis. Given the simplicity and generality of using D2O as a stable isotopic probe combined with the accessibility of kMSI to a range of MSI instrumentation, this approach has broad application for improving our understanding of how microbial interactions influence metabolite biosynthesis.",

We investigated the sources of the narrowband gamma oscillation, the factors modulating its strength, and its relationship to broadband gamma activity. Narrowband and broadband gamma power were uncorrelated. Increasing visual contrast had opposite effects on the two rhythms: it increased broadband activity, but suppressed the narrowband oscillation. The narrowband oscillation was strongest in layer 4, and was mediated primarily by excitatory currents entrained by the synchronous, rhythmic firing of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The power and peak frequency of the narrowband gamma oscillation increased with light intensity. Silencing the cortex optogenetically did not affect narrowband oscillation in either LGN firing or cortical excitatory currents, suggesting that this oscillation reflects unidirectional flow of signals from thalamus to cortex.\\n\\nHighlights*Local field potential in mouse primary visual cortex exhibits a pronounced narrowband gamma oscillation close to 60 Hz.\\n\\n*Narrowband gamma is highest in the thalamorecipient layer 4\\n\\n*Narrowband gamma increases with light intensity and arousal state, and is suppressed by visual contrast.\\n\\n*Lateral geniculate nucleus neurons fire synchronously at the narrowband gamma frequency, independent of V1 activity.",

Their claims include the argument that the rooting of our trees is artifactual and distorted by small genome (proteome) size. Here we uncover their aprioristic reasoning, which mingles with misunderstandings and misinterpretations of cladistic methodology. To demonstrate, we labeled the phylogenetic positions of the smallest proteomes in our phylogenetic trees and confirm that the smallest genomes were neither attracted towards the root nor caused any distortions in the four-supergroup tree of life. Their results therefore stem from confusing outgroups with ancestors and handpicking problematic taxa to distort tree reconstruction. In doing so, they ignored the details of our rooting method, taxa sampling rationale, the plethora of evidence given in our study supporting the ancient origin of the viral supergroup and also recent literature on viral evolution. Indeed, our tree of life uncovered many viral monophyletic groups consistent with ICTV classifications and showed remarkable evolutionary tracings of virion morphotypes onto a revealing tree topology.",

    "abstract": "Shigella sonnei is an emergent cause of diarrheal disease in middle-income countries. The organism causes endemic disease and is also associated with sporadic outbreaks in susceptible populations. In 2010 and 2011 there were two suspected outbreaks of diarrheal disease caused by S. sonnei in La Pampa province in central Argentina. Aiming to confirm these as outbreaks and provide insight into the relationship of the strains causing these infections we combined antimicrobial susceptibility testing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with whole genome sequencing (WGS). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing suggested the two events were unrelated; organisms isolated in 2010 exhibited resistance to trimethoprim sulphate whereas the 2011 S. sonnei were non-susceptible against ampicillin, trimethoprim sulphate and cefpodoxime. PFGE profiling confirmed the likelihood of two independent outbreaks, separating the isolates into two main XbaI restriction profiles. We additionally performed WGS on 17 isolates associated with these outbreaks. The resulting phylogeny confirmed the PFGE structure and separated the organisms into two comparatively distantly related clones. Antimicrobial resistant genes were common, and the presence of an OXA-1 was likely associated with resistance to cefpodoxime in the second outbreak. We additionally identified novel horizontally transferred genetic material that may impinge on the pathogenic phenotype of the infecting strains. Our study shows that even with a lack of supporting routine data WGS is an indispensible method for the tracking and surveillance of bacterial pathogens during outbreaks and is becoming a vital tool for the monitoring of antimicrobial resistant strains of S. sonnei.",
