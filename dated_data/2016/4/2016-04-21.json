    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by substantial phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, which greatly complicates the identification of genetic factors that contribute to the disease. Study designs have mainly focused on group differences between cases and controls. The problem is that, by their nature, group difference-based methods (e.g., differential expression analysis) blur or collapse the heterogeneity within groups. By ignoring genes with variable within-group expression, an important axis of genetic heterogeneity contributing to expression variability among affected individuals has been overlooked. To this end, we develop a new gene expression analysis method--aberrant gene expression analysis, based on the multivariate distance commonly used for outlier detection. Our method detects the discrepancies in gene expression dispersion between groups and identifies genes with significantly different expression variability. Using this new method, we re-visited RNA sequencing data generated from post-mortem brain tissues of 47 ASD and 57 control samples. We identified 54 functional gene sets whose expression dispersion in ASD samples is more pronounced than that in controls, as well as 76 co-expression modules present in controls but absent in ASD samples due to ASD-specific aberrant gene expression. We also exploited aberrantly expressed genes as biomarkers for ASD diagnosis. With a whole blood expression data set, we identified three aberrantly expressed gene sets whose expression levels serve as discriminating variables achieving >70% classification accuracy. In summary, our method represents a novel discovery and diagnostic strategy for ASD. Our findings may help open an expression variability-centered research avenue for other genetically heterogeneous disorders.",

    "abstract": "Although fitness costs associated with plant defensive traits are widely expected, they are not universally detected, calling into question their generality. Here we examine the potential for life history trade-offs associated with herbicide resistance by examining seed germination, root growth, and above-ground growth across 43 naturally occurring populations of Ipomoea purpurea that vary in their resistance to RoundUp(R), the most commonly used herbicide worldwide. We find evidence for life history trade-offs associated with all three traits; highly resistant populations had lower germination rates, shorter roots and smaller above-ground size. A visual exploration of the data indicated that the type of trade-off may differ among populations. Our results demonstrate that costs of adaptation may be present at stages other than simply the production of progeny in this agricultural weed. Additionally, the cumulative effect of costs at multiple life cycle stages can result in severe consequences to fitness when adapting to novel environments.",

We find significant differences among these vertebrates in the transcriptional activation of their full length GRs by these steroids, indicating that there were changes in the specificity of the GR for steroids during the evolution of terrestrial vertebrates. To begin to study the role of interactions between different domains on the GR in steroid sensitivity and specificity for terrestrial GRs, we investigated transcriptional activation of truncated GRs containing their hinge domain and ligand binding domain (LBD) fused to a GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4 DBD). Compared to corresponding full length GRs, transcriptional activation of GAL4 DBD-GR hinge/LBD constructs required higher steroid concentrations and displayed altered steroid specificity, indicating that interactions between the hinge/LBD and other domains are important in glucocorticoid activation of these terrestrial GRs.",

    "abstract": "The identification of kinase substrates and the specific phosphorylation sites they regulate is an important factor in understanding protein function regulation and signalling pathways. Computational prediction of kinase targets - assigning kinases to putative substrates, and selecting from protein sequence the sites that kinases can phosphorylate - requires the consideration of both the cellular context that kinases operate in, as well as their binding affinity. This consideration enables investigation of how phosphorylation influences a range of biological processes.\\n\\nWe report here a novel probabilistic model for the classification of kinase-specific phos-phorylation sites from sequence across three model organisms: human, mouse and yeast. The model incorporates position-specific amino acid frequencies, and counts of co-occurring amino acids from kinase binding sites in a kinase- and family-specific manner. We show how this model can be seamlessly integrated with protein interactions and cell-cycle abundance profiles. When evaluating the prediction accuracy of our method, PhosphoPICK, on an independent hold-out set of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites, we found it achieved an average specificity of 97% while correctly predicting 32% of true positives. We also compared PhosphoPICKs ability, through cross-validation, to predict kinase-specific phosphorylation sites with alternative methods, and found that at high levels of specificity PhosphoPICK outperforms alternative methods for most comparisons made.\\n\\nWe investigated the relationship between experimentally confirmed phosphorylation sites and predicted nuclear localisation signals by predicting the most likely kinases to be regulating the phosphorylated residues immediately upstream or downstream from the localisation signal. We show that kinases PKA, Akt1 and AurB have an over-representation of predicted binding sites at particular positions downstream from predicted nuclear localisation signals, indicating a greater role for phosphorylation in regulating the nuclear import of proteins than previously thought.\\n\\nPhosphoPICK is freely available online as a web-service at http://bioinf.scmb.uq.edu.au/phosphopick.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

Data obtained by tracking leaf growth over time can be reproduced with almost 90% accuracy by such a map. The growth follows a Moebius transformation, which is a type of conformal map that would arise if there were an underlying linear gradient of growth rate. From the data one can derive the parameters that describe this linear gradient and show how it changes over time. Growth according to a conformal map has the property of maintaining the flatness of a leaf.",

    "abstract": "It has been believed that de novo vessel formation (neo-vasculogenesis) can be induced by co-transplantation of pericytes or mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSPC) with endothelial cells or endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC). The requirement for co-transplantation of two adult progenitor cells is one factor that can potentially complicate the process of therapeutic vasculogenesis which hampers the development of strategies for therapeutic intervention referred to as  regenerative medicine. Here we employed a novel strategy for therapeutic vessel development by transplanting endothelial colony forming progenitor cells solely to immune compromised mice and detect vessel formation capacity of single ECFC transplants compared to ECFC/MSPC co-transplants. We applied umbilical cord derived and bone marrow derived-MSPC and umbilical cord derived ECFC with different total cell number for subcutaneous transplantation in matrix composites either alone or mixed at a ratio of 1:5 subcutaneously into immune deficient NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ; NSG mice. Implants were harvested one day, one, two, eight and 24 weeks after transplantation for detecting the state of vessel formation and stability of the transplants by histological assessments. Additionally, endothelial progenitor cells derived from various human tissues such as umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood and white adipose tissue were used to assess their potential for vessel formation in vivo.\\n\\nResults confirmed that single transplantation of ECFCs with a higher cell number and later in the time course after transplantation is as efficient as co-transplantation of ECFC with MSPC at forming stable-perfused human vessels. Amongst ECFCs isolated from different human sources, white adipose tissue derived ECFC are most potent in forming neo-vessels (micro-vessels) in vivo, thus WAT-ECFC could be an optimal cell for vasculogenesis regenerative application.\\n\\nCo-transplantation of ECFC and MSPC with the defined 5:1 ratio or sole ECFC with a higher cell dosage was essential for vessel generation in vivo.",

We compared the performance of the most popular methods against a dated tree of fossil Canidae derived from previously published monographs. Using a canid morphology dataset, we performed tip-dating using Beast 2.1.3 and MrBayes 3.2.5. We find that for key nodes (Canis, ~3.2 Ma, Caninae ~11.7 Ma) a non-mechanistic model using a uniform tree prior produces estimates that are unrealistically old (27.5, 38.9 Ma). Mechanistic models (incorporating lineage birth, death, and sampling rates) estimate ages that are closely in line with prior research. We provide a discussion of these two families of models (mechanistic vs. non-mechanistic) and their applicability to fossil datasets.",

    "abstract": "Mortality selection is a general concern in the social and health sciences. Recently, existing health and social science cohorts have begun to collect genomic data. Causes of selection into a genomic dataset can influence results from genomic analyses. Selective non-participation, which is specific to a particular study and its participants, has received attention in the literature. But mortality selection--the very general phenomenon that genomic data collected at a particular age represents selective participation by only the subset of birth cohort members who have survived to the time of data collection--has been largely ignored. Here we test the hypothesis that such mortality selection may significantly alter estimates in polygenetic association studies of both health and non-health traits. We demonstrate mortality selection into genome-wide SNP data collection at older ages using the U.S.-based Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We then model the selection process. Finally, we test whether mortality selection alters estimates from genetic association studies. We find evidence for mortality selection. Healthier and more socioeconomically advantaged individuals are more likely to survive to be eligible to participate in the genetic sample of the HRS. Mortality selection leads to modest drift in estimating time-varying genetic effects, a drift that is enhanced when estimates are produced from data that has additional mortality selection. There is no general solution for correcting for mortality selection in a birth cohort prior to entry into a longitudinal study. We illustrate how genetic association studies using HRS data can adjust for mortality selection from study entry to time of genetic data collection by including probability weights that account for mortality selection. Mortality selection should be investigated more broadly in genetically-informed samples from other cohort studies.",

However, these results have also been interpreted as demonstrating that cell-to-cell expression variability (noise) and mean are uncorrelated, a significant deviation from previous results. Here, we re-examine the available mRNA and protein abundance data for the HIV LTR and find that noise in mRNA and protein expression scales inversely with the mean along analytically predicted transcriptional burst-size manifolds. We then experimentally perturb transcriptional activity to test a prediction of the multiple burst-size model: that increasing burst frequency will cause mRNA noise to decrease along given burst-size lines as mRNA levels increase. The data show that mRNA and protein noise decrease as mean expression increases, supporting the canonical inverse correlation between noise and mean.\\n\\nConflict of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.",

A recent paper by Fu and Pachter presented frequentist statistical estimators for intrinsic and extrinsic noise using data from dual reporters [2]. For comparison, I here present results of a Bayesian analysis of this problem. I show that the orthodox estimators suffer from pathologies such as predicting negative values for a manifestly non-negative quantity, i.e. variance, and show that the Bayesian estimators do not suffer from such pathologies. In addition, I show that the Bayesian analysis automatically identifies that optimal estimates of intrinsic and extrinsic noise depend on a subtle combination of two statistics of the data, allowing for accuracies that are up to twice the accuracy of the orthodox estimators in some parameter regimes.\\n\\nI hope up this little worked out example contrasting orthodox statistical analysis based on ad hoc estimators with estimators resulting from a Bayesian analysis, will be educational for others in the field.
