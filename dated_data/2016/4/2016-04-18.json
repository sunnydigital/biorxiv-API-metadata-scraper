    "abstract": "Studies of the primate visual system have begun to test a wide range of complex computational object-vision models. Realistic models have many parameters, which in practice cannot be fitted using the limited amounts of brain-activity data typically available. Task performance optimization (e.g. using backpropagation to train neural networks) provides major constraints for fitting parameters and discovering nonlinear representational features appropriate for the task (e.g. object classification). Model representations can be compared to brain representations in terms of the representational dissimilarities they predict for an image set. This method, called representational similarity analysis (RSA), enables us to test the representational feature space as is (fixed RSA) or to fit a linear transformation that mixes the nonlinear model features so as to best explain a cortical areas representational space (mixed RSA). Like voxel/population-receptive-field modelling, mixed RSA uses a training set (different stimuli) to fit one weight per model feature and response channel (voxels here), so as to best predict the response profile across images for each response channel. We analysed response patterns elicited by natural images, which were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that early visual areas were best accounted for by shallow models, such as a Gabor wavelet pyramid (GWP). The GWP model performed similarly with and without mixing, suggesting that the original features already approximated the representational space, obviating the need for mixing. However, a higher ventral-stream visual representation (lateral occipital region) was best explained by the higher layers of a deep convolutional network, and mixing of its feature set was essential for this model to explain the representation. We suspect that mixing was essential because the convolutional network had been trained to discriminate a set of 1000 categories, whose frequencies in the training set did not match their frequencies in natural experience or their behavioural importance. The latter factors might determine the representational prominence of semantic dimensions in higher-level ventral-stream areas. Our results demonstrate the benefits of testing both the specific representational hypothesis expressed by a models original feature space and the hypothesis space generated by linear transformations of that feature space.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe tested computational models of representations in ventral-stream visual areas.\\nC_LIO_LIWe compared representational dissimilarities with/without linear remixing of model features.\\nC_LIO_LIEarly visual areas were best explained by shallow - and higher by deep - models.\\nC_LIO_LIUnsupervised shallow models performed better without linear remixing of their features.\\nC_LIO_LIA supervised deep convolutional net performed best with linear feature remixing.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Family and twin studies suggest that up to 50% of individual differences in human fertility within a population might be heritable. However, it remains unclear whether the genes associated with fertility outcomes such as number of children ever born (NEB) or age at first birth (AFB) are the same across geographical and historical environments. By not taking this into account, previous genetic studies implicitly assumed that the genetic effects are constant across time and space. We conduct a mega-analysis applying whole genome methods on 31,396 unrelated men and women from six Western countries. Across all individuals and environments, common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) explained only ~4% of the variance in NEB and AFB. We then extend these models to test whether genetic effects are shared across different environments or unique to them. For individuals belonging to the same population and demographic cohort (born before or after the 20th century fertility decline), SNP-based heritability was almost five times higher at 22% for NEB and 19% for AFB. We also found no evidence suggesting that genetic effects on fertility are shared across time and space. Our findings imply that the environment strongly modifies genetic effects on the tempo and quantum of fertility, that currently ongoing natural selection is heterogeneous across environments, and that gene-environment interactions may partly account for missing heritability in fertility. Future research needs to combine efforts from genetic research and from the social sciences to better understand human fertility.\\n\\nAuthors SummaryFertility behavior - such as age at first birth and number of children - varies strongly across historical time and geographical space. Yet, family and twin studies, which suggest that up to 50% of individual differences in fertility are heritable, implicitly assume that the genes important for fertility are the same across both time and space. Using molecular genetic data (SNPs) from over 30,000 unrelated individuals from six different countries, we show that different genes influence fertility in different time periods and different countries, and that the genetic effects consistently related to fertility are presumably small. The fact that genetic effects on fertility appear not to be universal could have tremendous implications for research in the area of reproductive medicine, social science and evolutionary biology alike.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms that ensure the integrity of the nuclear envelope rely on membrane remodeling proteins like the ESCRTs and the AAA ATPase Vps4, which help seal the nuclear envelope at the end of mitosis and prevent the formation of defective nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Here, we show that the integral inner nuclear membrane proteins Heh1 and Heh2 directly bind the ESCRT-III, Snf7, and the ESCRT-II/III chimera, Chm7, in their  open forms. Moreover, Heh1 is required for Chm7-recruitment to the nuclear envelope. As Chm7 accumulates on the nuclear envelope upon blocks to NPC assembly, but not to nuclear transport, interactions between ESCRTs and the Heh proteins might form a biochemically distinct nuclear envelope subdomain that delimits regions of assembling NPCs. Interestingly, deletion of CHM7 suppresses the formation of the storage of improperly assembled NPC compartment prevalent in vps4{Delta} strains. Thus, our data support that the Heh1-dependent recruitment of Chm7 is a key component of a quality control pathway whose local regulation by Vps4 and the transmembrane nup, Pom152, prevents loss of nuclear compartmentalization by defective NPCs.",

Distributions of run-lengths and velocities of processive molecular motors, like kinesin-1, are accessible through single molecule techniques, yet there is lack a rigorous theoretical model for these probabilities up to now. We derive exact analytic results for a kinetic model to predict the resistive force (F) dependent velocity (P(v)) and run-length (P(n)) distribution functions of generic finitely processive molecular motors that take forward and backward steps on a track. Our theory quantitatively explains the zero force kinesin-1 data for both P(n) and P(v) using the detachment rate as the only parameter, thus allowing us to obtain the variations of these quantities under load. At non-zero F, P(v) is non-Gaussian, and is bimodal with peaks at positive and negative values of v. The prediction that P(v) is bimodal is a consequence of the discrete step-size of kinesin-1, and remains even when the step-size distribution is taken into account. Although the predictions are based on analyses of kinesin-1 data, our results are general and should hold for any processive motor, which walks on a track by taking discrete steps.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLower birth weight is associated with increased susceptibility to cardiometabolic diseases in adulthood, but the underlying molecular pathways are incompletely understood. We examined associations of birth weight with a comprehensive metabolic profile measured in adolescents and adults.\\n\\nMethodsHigh-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics and biochemical assays were used to quantify 87 circulating metabolic measures in seven cohorts from Finland and the United Kingdom comprising altogether 18 288 individuals (mean age 26 years, range 15-75). Metabolic associations with birth weight were assessed by linear regression models adjusted for sex, gestational age, and age at blood sampling. The metabolic associations with birth weight were compared to the corresponding associations with adult body mass index (BMI).\\n\\nResultsLower birth weight was adversely associated with cardiometabolic biomarkers, including lipoprotein subclasses, fatty acids, amino acids, and markers of inflammation and impaired liver function (P<0.0015 for 46 measures). Associations were consistent across cohorts with different ages at metabolic profiling, but the magnitudes were weak. The pattern of metabolic deviations associated with lower birth weight resembled the metabolic signature of higher adult BMI (R2=0.77). The resemblance indicated that 1-kg lower birth weight is associated with similar metabolic aberrations as caused by 0.92-units higher BMI in adulthood.\\n\\nConclusionLower birth weight is associated with adverse biomarker aberrations across multiple metabolic pathways. Coherent metabolic signatures between lower birth weight and higher adult adiposity suggest potentially shared underlying molecular mechanisms. However, the magnitudes of metabolic associations with birth weight are modest in comparison to the effects of adiposity, implying that birth weight is only a weak indicator of metabolic risk in adulthood.\\n\\nKEY POINTSO_LILower birth weight is adversely associated with a wide range of established and emerging circulating cardiometabolic biomarkers in adulthood, including lipoprotein subclasses and their lipids, fatty acid balance, amino acids, and markers of inflammation and liver function.\\nC_LIO_LIThe metabolic associations are consistent across a wide age span from adolescence to retirement age, and similar for men and women.\\nC_LIO_LIThe magnitudes of metabolic aberrations are weak for the variation in birth weight observed in general population cohorts. Although the metabolic associations with birth weight are statistically significant, they are likely to be of minor public health relevance.\\nC_LIO_LIThe overall metabolic association pattern with lower birth weight closely resembles the metabolic signature of higher adult adiposity, suggesting that shared underlying metabolic pathways may be involved.\\nC_LIO_LI1-kg lower birth weight ({approx}2 SD) is associated with similar adverse metabolic effects as caused by 0.92 higher BMI ({approx}0.25 SD) in adulthood.

This has caused a remarkable delay in functional interpretation of several newly found genes in tissue and age specific manner, limiting the pace of biological research. This is mainly due to lack of advancements in methodological tools for transgenesis. Predominantly practiced method of transgenesis by pronuclear DNA-microinjection is time consuming, tedious and requires highly skilled persons for embryo-manipulation. Testicular electroporation mediated transgenesis requires use of electric current to testis. To this end, we have now developed an innovative technique for making transgenic mice by giving hypotonic shock to male germ cells for the gene delivery. Desired transgene was suspended in hypotonic Tris-HCl solution (pH 7.0) and simply injected in testis. This resulted in internalization of the transgene in dividing germ-cells residing at basal compartment of tubules leading to its integration in native genome of mice. Such males generated transgenic progeny by natural mating. Several transgenic animals can be generated with minimum skill within short span of time by this easily adaptable novel technique.",

Here, we show that the N-terminus of CHMP7, comprising tandem Winged Helix (WH)-domains, is a membrane-binding module. This activity allows CHMP7 to bind to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), an organelle continuous with the NE, and provides a platform to direct NE-recruitment of ESCRT-III during mitotic exit. Point mutations that disrupt membrane-binding prevent CHMP7 localising to the ER and its subsequent enrichment at the reforming NE. These mutations prevent both assembly of downstream ESCRT-III components at the reforming NE and proper establishment of post-mitotic nucleo-cytoplasmic compartmentalisation. These data identify a novel membrane-binding activity within an ESCRT-III subunit that is essential for post-mitotic nuclear regeneration.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryCHMP7s atypical N-terminus is a membrane-binding module that allows assembly and function of ESCRT-III at the nuclear envelope during mitotic exit.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical data, in particular omics datasets are being generated at an unprecedented rate. This is due to the falling costs of generating experimental data, improved accuracy and better accessibility to different omics platforms such as genomics, proteomics and metabolomics1,2. As a result, the number of deposited datasets in public repositories originating from various omics approaches has increased dramatically in recent years. With strong support from scientific journals and funders, public data sharing is increasingly considered to be a good scientific practice, facilitating the confirmation of original results, increasing the reproducibility of the analyses, enabling the exploration of new or related hypotheses, and fostering the identification of potential errors, discouraging fraud3. This increase in public data deposition of omics results is a good starting point, but opens up a series of new challenges. For example the research community must now find more efficient ways for storing, organizing and providing access to biomedical data across platforms. These challenges range from achieving a common representation framework for the datasets and the associated metadata from different omics fields, to the availability of efficient methods, protocols and file formats for data exchange between multiple repositories. Therefore, there is a great need for development of new platforms and applications to make possible to search datasets across different omics fields, making such information accessible to the end-user. The FAIR paradigm describes a set of guiding principles to address many of these issues, and aims to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable(https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples).",

High-throughput genotyping of transposable element insertions led to the discovery of more than 120 000 polymorphic loci, which, in their great majority, revealed a virtual absence of structure between the bio-geographic areas. Nevertheless, 92 outlier loci showed a high level of differentiation between temperate and tropical populations. The majority of these loci segregates at high insertion frequencies among European populations, indicating that this pattern could have been caused by recent adaptive evolution events in temperate areas. An analysis of the overlapping and neighboring genes highlighted several candidates, including diapause, lipid and juvenile hormone pathways.",

    "abstract": "Standard of care for multiple myeloma involves autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (AHCT), which can extend life by a year; however the disease remains incurable. A dendritic cell vaccine developed at Moffitt will be used both immediately before and after AHCT, with the aim of achieving complete response. Data will be collected during the trial to test the biological activity of the vaccine. This data will parameterize a model that facilitates the exploration of outcomes when varying the timing of vaccination. This calibrated model will also inform the design of a follow-up trial, which will include vaccination in conjunction with other immunotherapies.",
