    "abstract": "AimChanges in community composition resulting from environmental changes modify biotic interactions and affect the distribution and density of local populations. Such changes are currently occurring in nettle-feeding butterflies in Sweden where Araschnia levana has recently expanded its range northward and is now likely to interact with the resident species (Aglais urticae and Aglais io). Butterfly occurrence data collected over years and across regions enabled us to investigate how a recent range expansion of A. levana may have affected the environmental niche of resident species.\\n\\nLocationWe focused on two regions of Sweden (Sk[a]ne and Norrstrom) where A. levana has and has not established, and two time-periods (2001-2006, 2009-2012) during its establishment in Sk[a]ne.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed two distinct analyses in each region using the PCA-env and the framework described in Broennimann et al. (2012). First, we described the main sources of variation in the environment. Second, in each time-period and region, we characterized the realized niches of our focal species across topographic and land use gradients. Third, we quantified overlaps and differences in realized niches between and within species over time.\\n\\nResultsIn Sk[a]ne, A. levana has stabilized its distribution over time while the distribution of the native species has shifted. These shifts depicted a consistent pattern of avoiding overlap between the native species and the environmental space occupied by A. levana, and it was stronger for A. urticae than for A. io. In both regions, we also found evidence of niche partitioning between native species.\\n\\nMain conclusionsInterspecific interactions are likely to affect local species distributions. It appears that the ongoing establishment of A. levana has modified local biotic interactions, and induced shifts in resident species distributions. Among the mechanisms that can explain such patterns of niche partitioning, parasitoid-driven apparent competition may play an important role in this community.",

    "abstract": "Individuals affected by autism spectrum conditions (ASC) are considerably heterogeneous. Novel approaches are needed to parse this heterogeneity to enhance precision in clinical and translational research. Applying a clustering approach taken from genomics and systems biology on two large independent cognitive datasets of adults with and without ASC (n=715; n=251), we find replicable evidence for 5 discrete ASC subgroups that are highly differentiated in item-level performance on an explicit mentalizing task tapping ability to read complex emotion and mental states from the eye region of the face (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test; RMET). Three subgroups comprising 42-65% of ASC adults show evidence for large impairments (Cohens d = -1.03 to -11.21), while other subgroups are effectively unimpaired. These findings delineate robust natural subdivisions within the ASC population that may allow for more individualized inferences and accelerate research towards precision medicine goals.",

    "abstract": "Gene duplication and loss are major sources of genetic polymorphism in populations, and are important forces shaping the evolution of genome content and organization. We have reconstructed the origin and history of a 127 kbp segmental duplication, R2d, in the house mouse (Mus musculus). R2d contains a single protein-coding gene, Cwc22. De novo assembly of both the ancestral (R2d1) and the derived (R2d2) copies reveals that they have been subject to non-allelic gene conversion events spanning tens of kilobases. R2d2 is also a hotspot for structural variation: its diploid copy number ranges from zero in the mouse reference genome to more than 80 in wild mice sampled from around the globe. Hemizgyosity for high-copy-number alleles of R2d2 is associated in cis with meiotic drive, suppression of meiotic crossovers, and copy-number instability, with a mutation rate in excess of 1 per 100 transmissions in laboratory populations. We identify an additional 57 loci covering 0.8% of the mouse genome with patterns of sequence variation similar to those at R2d1 and R2d2. Our results provide a striking example of allelic diversity generated by duplication and demonstrate the value of de novo assembly in a phylogenetic context for understanding the mutational processes affecting duplicate genes.",

    "abstract": "Local adaptation is often studied via 1) multiple common garden experiments comparing performance of genotypes in different environments and 2) sequencing genotypes from multiple locations and characterizing geographic patterns in allele frequency. Both approaches aim to characterize the same pattern (local adaptation), yet the complementary information from each has not yet been coherently integrated. Here, we develop a genome-wide association model of genotype interactions with continuous environmental gradients (GxE), i.e. reaction norms. We present an approach to impute relative fitness, allowing us to coherently synthesize evidence from common garden and genome-environment associations. Our approach identifies loci exhibiting environmental clines where alleles are associated with higher fitness in home environments. Simulations show our approach can increase power to detect loci causing local adaptation. In a case study on Arabidopsis thaliana, most identified SNPs exhibited home allele advantage and fitness tradeoffs along climate gradients, suggesting selective gradients can maintain allelic clines. SNPs exhibiting GxE associations with fitness were enriched in genic regions, putative partial selective sweeps, and associations with an adaptive phenotype (flowering time plasticity). We discuss extensions for situations where only adaptive phenotypes other than fitness are available. Many types of data may point toward the loci underlying GxE and local adaptation; coherent models of diverse data provide a principled basis for synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Developmental prosopagnosia (DP) is characterized by deficits in face recognition without gross brain abnormalities. However, the neural basis of DP is not well understood. We measured population receptive fields (pRFs) in ventral visual cortex of DPs and typical adults to assess the contribution of spatial integration to face processing. While DPs showed typical retinotopic organization of ventral visual cortex and normal pRF sizes in early visual areas, we found significantly reduced pRF sizes in face-selective regions and in intermediate areas hV4 and VO1. Across both typicals and DPs, face recognition ability correlated positively with pRF size in both face-selective regions and VO1, whereby participants with larger pRFs perform better. However, face recognition ability is correlated with both pRF size and ROI volume only in face-selective regions. These findings suggest that smaller pRF sizes in DP may reflect a deficit in spatial integration affecting holistic processing required for face recognition.",

    "abstract": "Animals integrate physiological and environmental signals to modulate their food uptake. Failure to regulate feeding may have devastating results, including obesity and diabetes, underscoring the importance of understanding its underlying mechanisms. The nematode C. elegans, whose food uptake consists of pumping bacteria from the environment into the gut, provides excellent opportunities for discovering principles of conserved regulatory mechanisms. Here we show that worms implement a graded feeding response to the concentration of environmental bacteria by modulating a commitment to bursts of fast pumping. Using long-term, high-resolution, longitudinal recordings of feeding dynamics under defined conditions, we find that the frequency and duration of pumping bursts increase and the duration of long pauses diminishes in environments richer in bacteria. The bioamine serotonin, a known feeding regulator in metazoa, is required for food-dependent induction of bursts as well as for maintaining their high rate of pumping through two distinct mechanisms. Following this phenotype quantitatively we identify the essential serotonergic neurons and the differential roles of distinct families of serotonin receptors. We propose that regulation of bursts is a conserved mechanism of behavior and motor control.",

    "abstract": "The susceptibility of Native Americans to infectious disease has been postulated as a major factor for their population decline after European contact. To investigate if a preexisting genetic component contributed to this phenomenon, we analyzed 50 exomes of both ancient and modern individuals from the Northwest Coast of North America, dating from before and after European contact. We confirmed the genetic continuity between the ancient and modern individuals and modeled the population collapse after European contact, inferring a 57% reduction in effective population size. We also identified signatures of positive selection on immune-related genes in the ancient but not the modern group. The strongest selection signal in the ancients came from the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene HLA-DQA1, with alleles that are close to fixation. The important immune function of HLA-DQA1 supports an ancient adaptation to the environments of the Americas. The modern individuals show a marked decrease in the frequency of the associated alleles (the most pronounced variant showing a 64% difference). This decrease is likely due to the environmental change associated with European colonization, which resulted in a shift of selection pressures, whereby negative selection may have acted on the same gene after contact. Furthermore, the selection pressure shift could correlate to the European-borne epidemics of the 1800s, suffered in the Northwest Coast region. This is among the first studies to examine a single population through time and exemplifies the power of such studies in uncovering nuanced demographic and adaptive histories.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian genome is transcribed into large numbers of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), but the definition of functional lncRNA groups has proven difficult, partly due to their low sequence conservation and lack of identified shared properties. Here we consider positional conservation across mammalian genomes as an indicator of functional commonality. We identify 665 conserved lncRNA promoters in mouse and human genomes that are preserved in genomic position relative to orthologous coding genes. The identified  positionally conserved lncRNA genes are primarily associated with developmental transcription factor loci with which they are co-expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Strikingly, over half of all positionally conserved RNAs in this set are linked to distinct chromatin organization structures, overlapping the binding sites for the CTCF chromatin organizer and located at chromatin loop anchor points and borders of topologically associating domains (TADs). These topological anchor point (tap)RNAs possess conserved sequence domains that are enriched in potential recognition motifs for Zinc Finger proteins. Characterization of these noncoding RNAs and their associated coding genes shows that they are functionally connected: they regulate each others expression and influence the metastatic phenotype of cancer cells in vitro in a similar fashion. Thus, interrogation of positionally conserved lncRNAs identifies a new subset of tapRNAs with shared functional properties. These results provide a large dataset of lncRNAs that conform to the \\\"extended gene\\\" model, in which conserved developmental genes are genomically and functionally linked to regulatory lncRNA loci across mammalian evolution.",

In this study, we used DNA capture and next generation sequencing to obtain whole genome data from syphilis patient specimens and from treponemes propagated in laboratory settings. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the syphilis strains examined here share a common ancestor after the 15th century.

    "abstract": "Animal and plant richness in tropical rainforests has long intrigued naturalist. More recent work has revealed that parasites contribute to high tropical tree diversity (Bagchi et al., 2014; Terborgh, 2012) and that arthropods are the most diverse eukaryotes in these forests (Erwin, 1982; Basset et al., 2012). It is unknown if similar patterns are reflected at the microbial scale with unicellular eukaryotes or protists. Here we show, using environmental metabarcoding and a novel phylogeny-aware cleaning step, that protists inhabiting Neotropical rainforest soils are hyperdiverse and dominated by the parasitic Apicomplexa, which infect arthropods and other animals. These host-specific protist parasites potentially contribute to the high animal diversity in the forests by reducing population growth in a density-dependent manner. By contrast, we found too few Oomycota to broadly drive high tropical tree diversity in a host-specific manner under the Janzen-Connell model (Janzen, 1970; Connell, 1970). Extremely high OTU diversity and high heterogeneity between samples within the same forests suggest that protists, not arthropods, are the most diverse eukaryotes in tropical rainforests. Our data show that microbes play a large role in tropical terrestrial ecosystems long viewed as being dominated by macro-organisms.\\n\\nContact: dunthorn@rhrk.uni-kl.de",

The few that have been characterized in detail sense nitric oxide (NsrR), iron limitation (RirA), cysteine availability (CymR) and the iron sulfur (Fe-S) cluster status of the cell (IscR). In this study we combined ChIP- and dRNA-seq with in vitro biochemistry to characterize a putative NsrR homologue in Streptomyces venezuelae. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that rather than regulating the nitrosative stress response like Streptomyces coelicolor NsrR, Sven6563 binds to a conserved motif at a different, much larger set of genes with a diverse range of functions, including a number of regulators, genes required for glutamine synthesis, NADH/NAD(P)H metabolism, as well as general DNA/RNA and amino acid/protein turn over. Our biochemical experiments further show that Sven6563 has a [2Fe-2S] cluster and that the switch between oxidized and reduced cluster controls its DNA binding activity in vitro. To our knowledge, both the sensing domain and the putative target genes are novel for an Rrf2 protein, suggesting Sven6563 represents a new member of the Rrf2 superfamily. Given the redox sensitivity of its Fe-S cluster we have tentatively named the protein RsrR for Redox sensitive response Regulator.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with plant species have employed inbred lines panels. Thus, to our knowledge, no information is available on theory and efficiency of GWAS in open-pollinated populations. Our objectives are to present quantitative genetics theory for GWAS, evaluate the relative efficiency of GWAS in non-inbred and inbred populations and in an inbred lines panel, and assess factors affecting GWAS, such as linkage disequilibrium (LD), sample size, and quantitative trait locus (QTL) heritability. Fifty samples of 400 individuals from populations with LD were simulated. Individuals were genotyped for 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotyped for traits with different degrees of dominance controlled by 10 QTLs and 90 minor genes. The average SNP density was 0.1 centiMorgan and the trait heritabilities were 0.4 and 0.8. We assessed GWAS efficiency based on the power of QTL detection, number of false-positive associations, bias in the estimated QTL position, and range of the significant SNPs for the same QTL. When the LD between a QTL and one or more SNPs is restricted to markers very close to or within the QTL, GWAS in open-pollinated populations can be highly efficient, depending mainly on QTL heritability and sample size. GWAS achieved the highest power of QTL detection, the smallest number of false-positive associations, and the lowest bias in the estimated QTL position for the inbred lines panel correcting for population structure. Under low QTL heritability and reduced sample size, GWAS is ineffective for non-inbred and inbred populations and for inbred lines panel.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian genomes are pervasively transcribed to produce thousands of spliced long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), whose functions remain poorly understood. Because recent evidence has implicated several specific lncRNA loci in the local regulation of gene expression, we sought to determine whether such local regulation is a property of many lncRNA loci. We used genetic manipulations to dissect 12 genomic loci that produce lncRNAs and found that 5 of these loci influence the expression of a neighboring gene in cis. Surprisingly, however, none of these effects required the specific lncRNA transcripts themselves and instead involved general processes associated with their production, including enhancer-like activity of gene promoters, the process of transcription, and the splicing of the transcript. Interestingly, such effects are not limited to lncRNA loci: we found similar effects on local gene expression at 4 of 6 protein-coding loci. These results demonstrate that  crosstalk among neighboring genes is a prevalent phenomenon that can involve multiple mechanisms and cis regulatory signals, including a novel role for RNA splicing. These mechanisms may explain the function and evolution of some genomic loci that produce lncRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Selfish genetic elements have profound biological and evolutionary consequences. Mutant mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) can be viewed as selfish genetic elements that persist in a state of heteroplasmy despite having potentially deleterious consequences to the organism. We sought to investigate mechanisms that allow selfish mtDNA to achieve and sustain high levels. Here, we establish a large 3.1kb deletion bearing mtDNA variant uaDf5 as a bona fide selfish genome in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Next, using droplet digital PCR to quantify mtDNA copy number, we show that uaDf5 mutant mtDNA replicates in addition to, not at the expense of, wildtype mtDNA. These data suggest existence of homeostatic copy number control for wildtype mtDNA that is exploited by uaDf5 to  hitchhike to high frequency. We also observe activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) in animals with uaDf5. Loss of UPRmt results in a decrease in uaDf5 frequency whereas constitutive activation of UPRmt increases uaDf5 levels. These data suggest that UPRmt allows uaDf5 levels to increase. Interestingly, the decreased uaDf5 levels in absence of UPRmt recover in parkin mutants lacking mitophagy, suggesting that UPRmt protects uaDf5 from mitophagy. We propose that cells activate two homeostatic responses, mtDNA copy number control and UPRmt, in uaDf5 heteroplasmic animals. Inadvertently, these homeostatic responses allow uaDf5 levels to be higher than they would be otherwise. In conclusion, our data suggest that homeostatic stress response mechanisms play an important role in regulating selfish mitochondrial genome dynamics.",

    "abstract": "LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons are dynamic elements. They have the potential to cause great genomic change due to their ability to  jump around the genome and amplify themselves, resulting in the duplication and rearrangement of regulatory DNA. Active L1, in particular, are often thought of as tightly constrained, homologous and ubiquitous elements with well-characterised domain organisation. For the past 30 years, model organisms have been used to define L1s as 6-8kb sequences containing a 5-UTR, two open reading frames working harmoniously in cis, and a 3-UTR with a polyA tail.\\n\\nIn this study, we demonstrate the remarkable and overlooked diversity of L1s via a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of over 500 species from widely divergent branches of the tree of life. The rapid and recent growth of L1 elements in mammalian species is juxtaposed against their decline in plant species and complete extinction in most reptiles and insects. In fact, some of these previously unexplored mammalian species (e.g. snub-nosed monkey, minke whale) exhibit L1 retrotranspositional  hyperactivity far surpassing that of human or mouse. In contrast, non-mammalian L1s have become so varied that the current classification system seems to inadequately capture their structural characteristics. Our findings illustrate how both long-term inherited evolutionary patterns and random bursts of activity in individual species can significantly alter genomes, highlighting the importance of L1 dynamics in eukaryotes.",

In this perspective, we present an overview of these often \\\"weird\\\" features. We discuss the origin of meiosis (origin of ploidy reduction and recombination, two-step meiosis), its secondary modifications (in polyploids or asexuals, inverted meiosis), its importance in punctuating life cycles (meiotic arrests, epigenetic resetting, meiotic asymmetry, meiotic fairness) and features associated with recombination (disjunction constraints, heterochiasmy, crossover interference and hotspots). We present the various evolutionary scenarios and selective pressures that have been proposed to account for these features, and we highlight that their evolutionary significance often remains largely mysterious. Resolving these mysteries will likely provide decisive steps towards understanding why sex and recombination are found in the majority of eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "We consider life as a cyclic physicochemical process that makes heredity and Darwinian evolution observable through living cells. We elaborate four principles that constrain current speculations about lifes emergence to natural processes driven by diurnal physicochemical gradients, primarily of temperature, water activity and electromagnetic radiation. First, Earths prebiotic chemical evolution is historically continuous with Darwinian evolution; second, cycling energies of solar radiation are primary drivers of chemical evolution; third, environmental molecular complexity must be high at the origin of life; and fourth, non-covalent molecular forces determine molecular recognition and cellular organization. Under normal physiological conditions of high ionic strength and high macromolecular crowding, hydration interactions (hydrogen bonding), screened electrostatic forces and excluded volume repulsions act over a commensurate distance of about one nanometer. This intermolecular distance governs chemical coevolution of proto-biomacromolecular surfaces (nucleic acids, proteins and membranes) toward Darwinian thresholds and living states. The above physicochemical principles of lifes emergence are consistent with the second law of thermodynamics, and with the current facts of molecular microbiology and planetary sciences. New kinds of experimentation with crowded molecular mixtures under oscillating temperature gradients - a PCR-like mechanism of lifes origins - can further illuminate how living states come about.\\n\\nGraphical abstractLifes emergence follows from chemical and Darwinian evolution, a high degree of molecular complexity and a high crowdedness, and non-covalent molecular forces that determine molecular recognition and cellular organization. The macromolecules divide the cytoplasm into dynamically crowded macromolecular regions and topologically complementary electrolyte pools. Small ions and ionic metabolites are transported vectorially between the electrolyte pools and through the (semi-conducting) electrolyte pathways of the crowded macromolecular regions.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=103 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/050740_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (36K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1963682org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d49be0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@45ac46org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@312efc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChanges in brain connectivity in patients with early Alzheimers disease (AD) have been investigated using graph analysis. However, these studies were based on small data sets, explored a limited range of network parameters, and did not focus on more restricted sub-networks, where neurodegenerative processes may introduce more prominent alterations.\\n\\nMethodsIn this study, we constructed structural brain networks out of 87 regions by using data from 135 healthy elders and 100 early AD patients selected from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. We evaluated the graph properties of these networks by investigating metrics of network efficiency, small world properties, segregation, product measures of complexity, and entropy. Because degenerative processes take place at different rates in different brain areas, analysis restricted to sub-networks may reveal changes otherwise undetected. Therefore, we first analyzed the graph properties of a network encompassing all brain areas considered together, and then repeated the analysis after dividing the brain areas into two sub-networks constructed by applying a clustering algorithm.\\n\\nResultsAt the level of large scale network, the analysis did not reveal differences between AD patients and controls. In contrast, the same analysis performed on the two sub-networks revealed modifications accompanying AD. Changes in small world properties suggested that the ability to engage concomitantly in integration and segregation of information diminished with AD in the sub-network containing the areas of medial temporal lobe known to be heaviest and earliest affected. In contrast, we found that the second network showed an increase in small world propensity, a novel metric that unbiasedly quantifies small world structure. Complexity and entropy measures indicated that the intricacy of connection patterns and structural diversity decreased in both sub-networks.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results show that neurodegenerative processes impact volumetric networks in a non-global fashion. Our findings provide new quantitative insights into topological principles of structural brain networks and their modifications during early stages of Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Empathy is the ability to recognize and respond to the emotional states of other individuals. It is an important psychological process that facilitates navigating social interactions and maintaining relationships, which are important for wellbeing. Several psychological studies have identified difficulties in both self-report and performance-based measures of empathy in a range of psychiatric conditions. To date, no study has systematically investigated the genetic architecture of empathy using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we report the results of the largest GWAS of empathy to date using a well-validated self-report measure of empathy, the Empathy Quotient (EQ), in 46,861 research participants from 23andMe, Inc. We identify 11 suggestive loci (P < 1x10-6), though none were significant at P < 2.5x10-8 after correcting for multiple testing. The most significant SNP was identified in the non-stratified analysis (rs4882760; P = 4.29x10-8), and is an intronic SNP in TMEM132C. The EQ had a modest but significant narrow-sense heritability (0.11{+/-}0.014; P = 1.7x10-14). As predicted, based on earlier work, we confirmed a significant female-advantage on the EQ (P < 2x10-16 Cohens d = 0.65). We identified similar SNP heritability and high genetic correlation between the sexes. Also, as predicted, we identified a significant negative genetic correlation between autism and the EQ (rg = -0.27{+/-}0.07, P = 1.63x10-4). We also identified a significant positive genetic correlation between the EQ and risk for schizophrenia (rg = 0.19{+/-}0.04; P= 1.36x10-5), risk for anorexia nervosa (rg = 0.32{+/-}0.09; P = 6x10-4), and extraversion (rg = 0.45{+/-}0.08; 5.7x10-8). This is the first GWAS of self-reported empathy. The results suggest that the genetic variations associated with empathy also play a role in psychiatric conditions and psychological traits.",

Their claims include the argument that the rooting of our trees is artifactual and distorted by small genome (proteome) size. Here we uncover their aprioristic reasoning, which mingles with misunderstandings and misinterpretations of cladistic methodology. To demonstrate, we labeled the phylogenetic positions of the smallest proteomes in our phylogenetic trees and confirm that the smallest genomes were neither attracted towards the root nor caused any distortions in the four-supergroup tree of life. Their results therefore stem from confusing outgroups with ancestors and handpicking problematic taxa to distort tree reconstruction. In doing so, they ignored the details of our rooting method, taxa sampling rationale, the plethora of evidence given in our study supporting the ancient origin of the viral supergroup and also recent literature on viral evolution. Indeed, our tree of life uncovered many viral monophyletic groups consistent with ICTV classifications and showed remarkable evolutionary tracings of virion morphotypes onto a revealing tree topology.",

    "abstract": "Pioneering studies into the effects of elevated CO2 on the behaviour of reef fishes often tested high-CO2 reared fish using control water in the test arena. While subsequent studies using rearing treatment water (control or high CO2) in the test arena have confirmed the effects of high CO2 on a range of reef fish behaviours, a further investigation into the use of different test water in the experimental arena is warranted. Here, we used a fully factorial design to test the effect of rearing treatment water (control or high CO2) and experimental test water (control or high CO2) on antipredator responses of larval reef fishes. We tested antipredator behaviour in larval clownfish Amphiprion percula and ambon damselfish Pomacentrus amboinensis, two species that have been used in previous high CO2 experiments. Specifically we tested if: 1) using control or high CO2 water in a two channel flume influenced the response of larval clownfish to predator odour, and 2) using control or high CO2 water in the test arena influenced the escape response of larval damselfish to a startle stimulus. Finally, 3) because the effects of high CO2 on fish behaviour appear to be caused by altered function of the GABA-A neurotransmitter we tested if antipredator behaviours were restored in clownfish treated with a GABA antagonist (gabazine) in high CO2 water. Larval clownfish reared from hatching in control water (496 atm) strongly avoided predator cue whereas larval clownfish reared from hatching in high CO2 (1022 atm) were attracted to the predator cue, as has been reported in previous studies. There was no effect of testing fish using control or high CO2 water in the flume. Larval damselfish reared for 4 days in high CO2 (1051 atm) exhibited a slower response to a startle stimulus, slower escape speed and a shorter escape distance compared with fish reared in control conditions (464 atm). There was no effect of test water on escape responses. Treatment of high-CO2 reared clownfish with 4 mg l-1 gabazine in high CO2 seawater restored the normal response to predator odour, as has been previously reported with fish tested in control water. Our results show that using control water in the experimental trials did not influence the results of previous studies on antipredator behaviour of reef fishes and also supports the results of novel experiments conducted in natural reef habitat at ambient CO2 levels.",
