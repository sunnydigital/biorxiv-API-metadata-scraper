    "abstract": "Studying the evolutionary dynamics of an alien species surviving and continuing to expand after several generations can provide fundamental information on the relevant features of clearly successful invasions. Here, we tackle this task by investigating the dynamics of the genetic diversity in invasive crested porcupine (Hystrix cristata) populations, introduced to Italy about 1500 years ago, which are still growing in size, distribution range and ecological niche. Using genome-wide RAD markers, we describe the structure of the genetic diversity and the demographic dynamics of the H. cristata invasive populations and compare their genetic diversity with that of native African populations of both H. cristata and its sister species, H. africaeaustralis. First, we demonstrate that genetic diversity is lower in both the invasive Italian and the North Africa source range relative to other native populations from Sub-Saharan and South Africa. Second, we find evidence of multiple introduction events in the invasive range followed by very limited gene flow. Through coalescence-based demographic reconstructions, we also show that the bottleneck at introduction was mild and did not affect the introduced genetic diversity. Finally, we reveal that the current spatial expansion at the northern boundary of the range is following a leading-edge model characterized by a general reduction of genetic diversity towards the edge of the expanding range. We conclude that the level of genome-wide diversity of H. cristata invasive populations is less important in explaining its successful invasion than species-specific life-history traits or the phylogeographic history in the native source range.",

    "abstract": "Increased filtration of albumin, a result of injury to glomerular endothelial and epithelial cells (podocytes), leads to increased albumin excretion rate (AER) which defines \\\"moderate albuminuria\\\", a predictor of cardiovascular events (CVD). Since filtered albumin is modified by renal proximal tubule albumin retrieval, we hypothesized that urinary podocyte shedding (podocyturia), as a biomarker of ongoing glomerular microvascular injury, may be a more relevant and earlier predictor of CVD than moderate albuminuria.\\n\\nType II diabetic subjects (mean age: 46/60 men/women) with normal AER [<2.26 mg/mmole (20 g/mg) creatinine] and free of overt cardiovascular disease (CVD) were studied. AER and podocyte-specific proteins (podocin and nephrin) mRNAs were measured at baseline (Visit 1), 3-4 years later (Visit 2) and at 7 years (Visit 3). Development of CVD (acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and/or peripheral vascular disease) was collected as outcome. Seven-year Kaplan-Meier time-to-event (log rank) data were compared among baseline biomarker tercile groups (low, intermediate, high).\\n\\nAll three biomarkers increased significantly between visits. Visit 1AER terciles exhibited similar time to CVD (p=0.127), in contrast with step-wise and substantial increases in CVD events predicted by Visit 1 podocin and nephrin terciles. Considered as continuous factors, the covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) [HR] were highest for podocin mRNA [HR=15.9 (6.1-41.8); p<0.001], intermediate for nephrin mRNA [HR=7.61 (3.75-15.5); p<0*001] and lowest for AER [HR=1.17 (1.01-1.36); p=0*041].\\n\\nCompared to moderate albuminuria, podocyturia predicts more accurately and at a significantly earlier time point the presence of silent systemic vascular injury ultimately manifesting as overt cardiovascular events.",

    "abstract": "In vitro production of erythrocytes in physiologic numbers from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) holds great promise for improved transfusion medicine and novel cell therapies. We report here, for the first time, a strategy for scalable and xeno-free differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from hiPSCs and subsequent erythrocytes specification, by using stepwise cell culture conditions and by integrating spinner flasks and rocker. This system supported robust and reproducible definitive hematopoietic differentiation of multiple hiPSC lines. We demonstrated an ultra-high yield of up to 4x109 CD235a+ erythrocytes at >98% purity when using a 1-litre spinner flask for suspension culture. Erythrocytes generated from our system can reach a mature stage with red blood cell (RBC) characteristics of enucleation, {beta}-globin protein expression and oxygen-binding ability. The entire process is xeno-free and clinically compliant, allowing future mass production of hiPSC-derived RBCs for transfusion medicine purposes.",

    "abstract": "A critical event for the ability of cells to tolerate DNA damage and replication stress is activation of the ATR kinase. ATR activation is dependent on the BRCT repeat-containing protein TopBP1. Previous work has shown that recruitment of TopBP1 to sites of DNA damage and stalled replication forks is necessary for downstream events in ATR activation, however the mechanism for this recruitment was not known. Here, we use protein binding assays and functional studies in Xenopus egg extracts to show that TopBP1 makes a direct interaction, via its BRCT2 domain, with RPA-coated ssDNA. We identify a point mutant that abrogates this interaction, and show that this mutant fails to accumulate at sites of DNA damage, and that the mutant cannot activate ATR. These data thus supply a mechanism for how the critical ATR activator, TopBP1, senses DNA damage and stalled replication forks to initiate assembly of checkpoint signaling complexes.",

Amplicon sequencing has been critical for characterization of highly diverse microbiomes, but several challenges still hinder their investigation: (1) Poor coverage of the full diversity, (2) Read depth losses and (3) Erroneous diversity inflation/distortion.\\nC_LIO_LIWe developed a modular approach to quickly profile at least 8 interchangeable loci in a single sequencing run, including a simple and cost-effective way to block amplification of non-targets (like host DNA). We further correct observed distortion in amplified diversity by phylogenetically grouping erroneous OTUs, creating a phylogeny-based unit we call OPUs.\\nC_LIO_LIOur approach achieves full, accurate characterization of a mixed-kingdom mock community of bacteria, fungi and oomycetes at high depth even in non-target contaminated systems. The OPU concept enables much more accurate estimations of alpha and beta diversity trends than OTUs and overcomes disagreements between studies caused by methodology. Leveraging the approach in the Arabidopsis thaliana phyllosphere, we generated to our knowledge the most complete microbiome survey to date.\\nC_LIO_LIMicrobiomes are extremely diverse, extending well beyond bacteria and fungi.

    "abstract": "Background: Understanding the relationship between a stimulus and how it is perceived reveals fundamental principles about the mechanisms of sensory perception. While this stimulus-percept problem is mostly understood for color vision and tone perception, it is not currently possible to predict how a given molecule smells. While there has been some progress in predicting the pleasantness and intensity of an odor, perceptual data for a larger number of diverse molecules are needed to improve current predictions. Towards this goal, we tested the olfactory perception of 480 structurally and perceptually diverse molecules at two concentrations using a panel of 55 healthy human subjects.\\n\\nResults: For each stimulus, we collected data on perceived intensity, pleasantness, and familiarity. In addition, subjects were asked to apply 20 semantic odor quality descriptors to these stimuli, and were offered the option to describe the smell in their own words. Using this dataset, we replicated several previous correlations between molecular features of the stimulus and olfactory perception. The number of sulfur atoms in a molecule was highly correlated with the descriptors \\\"garlic\\\" \\\"fish\\\" \\\"decayed,\\\" and large and structurally complex molecules were perceived to be more pleasant. We discovered a number of strong correlations in intensity perception between molecules, which suggests a shared mechanism for perceiving these molecules. We show that familiarity had a strong effect on the ability of subjects to describe a smell. Many subjects used commercial products to describe familiar odors, highlighting the role of prior experience in biasing verbal report of perceived smells. Nonspecific descriptors like \\\"chemical\\\" were applied frequently to unfamiliar smells, and unfamiliar odors were generally rated as neither pleasant nor unpleasant.\\n\\nConclusions: We present a very large psychophysical dataset and use this to correlate molecular features of a stimulus to olfactory percept. Our work reveals robust correlations between molecular features and perceptual qualities, and highlights the dominant role of familiarity and experience in assigning verbal descriptors to smells.",

    "abstract": "Harmful mutations are ubiquitous and inevitable, and the rate at which these mutations are removed from populations is a critical determinant of evolutionary fate. Closely related sexual and asexual taxa provide a particularly powerful setting to study deleterious mutation elimination because sexual reproduction should facilitate mutational clearance by reducing selective interference between sites and by allowing the production of offspring with different mutational complements than their parents. Here, we compared the rate of removal of conservative (i.e., similar biochemical properties) and radical (i.e., distinct biochemical properties) nonsynonymous mutations from mitochondrial genomes of sexual vs. asexual Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a New Zealand freshwater snail characterized by coexisting and ecologically similar sexual and asexual lineages. Our analyses revealed that radical nonsynonymous mutations are cleared at higher rates than conservative changes and that sexual lineages eliminate radical changes more rapidly than asexual counterparts. These results are consistent with reduced efficacy of purifying selection in asexual lineages allowing harmful mutations to remain polymorphic longer than in sexual lineages. Together, these data illuminate some of the population-level processes contributing to mitochondrial mutation accumulation and suggest that mutation accumulation could influence the outcome of competition between sexual and asexual lineages.",

We examined reasons for normal pupation but early pupal death observed in certain cases.\\n\\nResultsOver-expression of activated Ras in developing eye/wing discs inhibited Ptth expression in brain via up-regulated JNK signaling mediated Dilp8 secretion from imaginal discs, which inhibited ecdysone synthesis in prothoracic gland after pupariation, leading to death of ~25-30 Hr old pupae. Inhibition of elevated Ras signaling completely rescued early pupal death while post-pupation administration of ecdysone to organisms with elevated Ras signaling in eye discs partially rescued their early pupal death. Unlike the earlier known Dilp8 action in delaying pupation, hyperactivated Ras mediated elevation of pJNK signaling in imaginal discs caused Dilp8 secretion after pupariation. Ectopic expression of certain other transgene causing pupal lethality similarly enhanced pJNK and early pupal Dilp8. Sub-optimal ecdysone levels after 8 Hr of pupation prevented the early pupal metamorphic changes and caused organismal death.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results reveal early pupal stage as a novel Dilp8 mediated post-pupariation checkpoint and provide further evidence for inter-organ signaling during development, wherein a peripheral tissue influences the CNS driven endocrine function.",
