    "abstract": "Mash extends the MinHash dimensionality-reduction technique to include a pairwise mutation distance and P-value significance test, enabling the efficient clustering and search of massive sequence collections. Mash reduces large sequences and sequence sets to small, representative sketches, from which global mutation distances can be rapidly estimated. We demonstrate several use cases, including the clustering of all 54,118 NCBI RefSeq genomes in 33 CPU hours; real-time database search using assembled or unassembled Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, and Oxford Nanopore data; and the scalable clustering of hundreds of metagenomic samples by composition.

    "abstract": "Dimension reduction methods are commonly applied to high-throughput biological datasets. However, the results can be hindered by confounding factors, either biologically or technically originated. In this study, we extend Principal Component Analysis to propose AC-PCA for simultaneous dimension reduction and adjustment for confounding variation. We show that AC-PCA can adjust for a) variations across individual donors present in a human brain exon array dataset, and b) variations of different species in a model organism ENCODE RNA-Seq dataset. Our approach is able to recover the anatomical structure of neocortical regions, and to capture the shared variation among species during embryonic development. For gene selection purposes, we extend AC-PCA with sparsity constraints, and propose and implement an efficient algorithm. The methods developed in this paper can also be applied to more general settings.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 paracaspases originated in the Ediacaran geological period before the last common ancestor of bilaterians and cnidarians (Planulozoa). Cnidarians have several paralog type 1 paracaspases, type 2 paracaspases, and a homolog of Bcl10. Notably in bilaterians, lineages like nematodes and insects lack Bcl10 whereas other lineages such as vertebrates, hemichordates, annelids and mollusks have a Bcl10 homolog. A survey of invertebrate CARD-coiled-coil (CC) domain homologs of CARMA/CARD9 revealed such homologs only in species with Bcl10, indicating an ancient co-evolution of the entire CARD-CC/Bcl10/MALT1-like paracaspase (CBM) complex. Furthermore, vertebrate-like Syk/Zap70 tyrosine kinase homologs with the ITAM-binding SH2 domain were found in invertebrate organisms with CARD-CC/Bcl10, indicating that this pathway might be the original user of the CBM complex. We also established that the downstream signaling proteins TRAF2 and TRAF6 are functionally conserved in Cnidaria. There also seems to be a correlation where invertebrates with CARD-CC and Bcl10 have type 1 paracaspases which are more similar to the paracaspases found in vertebrates. A proposed evolutionary scenario includes at least two ancestral type 1 paracaspase paralogs in the planulozoan last common ancestor, where at least one paralog usually is dependent on CARD-CC/Bcl10 for its function. Functional analyses of invertebrate type 1 paracaspases and Bcl10 homologs support this scenario and indicate an ancient origin of the CARD-CC/Bcl10/paracaspase signaling complex. Results from cnidarians, nematodes and mice also suggest an ancient neuronal role for the type 1 paracaspases.",

    "abstract": "Axons are the cable-like neuronal processes wiring the nervous system. They contain parallel bundles of microtubules as structural backbones, surrounded by regularly-spaced actin rings termed the periodic membrane skeleton (PMS). Despite being an evolutionarily-conserved, ubiquitous, highly-ordered feature of axons, the function of PMS is unknown. Here we studied PMS abundance, organisation and function, combining versatile Drosophila genetics with super-resolution microscopy and various functional readouts. Analyses with 11 different actin regulators and 3 actin-targeting drugs suggest PMS to contain short actin filaments which are depolymerisation resistant and sensitive to spectrin, adducin and nucleator deficiency - consistent with microscopy-derived models proposing PMS as specialised cortical actin. Upon actin removal we observed gaps in microtubule bundles, reduced microtubule polymerisation and reduced axon numbers suggesting a role of PMS in microtubule organisation. These effects become strongly enhanced when carried out in neurons lacking the microtubule-stabilising protein Short stop (Shot). Combining the aforementioned actin manipulations with Shot deficiency revealed a close correlation between PMS abundance and microtubule regulation, consistent with a model in which PMS-dependent microtubule polymerisation contributes to their maintenance in axons. We discuss potential implications of this novel PMS function along axon shafts for axon maintenance and regeneration.\\n\\nSignificance statementAxons are cable-like neuronal processes that are up to a meter long in humans. These delicate structures often need to be maintained for an organisms lifetime, i.e. up to a century in humans. Unsurprisingly, we gradually lose about 50% of axons as we age. Bundles of microtubules form the structural backbones and highways for life-sustaining transport within axons, and maintenance of these bundles is essential for axonal longevity. However, the mechanisms which actively maintain axonal microtubules are poorly understood. Here we identify cortical actin as an important factor maintaining microtubule polymerisation in axons. This finding provides potential explanations for the previously identified, but unexplained, links between mutations in genes encoding cortical actin regulators and neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "The coupling of ecology and evolution during range expansions enables mutations to establish at expanding range margins and reach high frequencies. This phenomenon, called allele surfing, is thought to have caused revolutions in the gene pool of many species, most evidently in microbial communities. It has remained unclear, however, under which conditions allele surfing promotes or hinders adaptation. Here, using microbial experiments and simulations, we show that, starting with standing adaptive variation, range expansions generate a larger increase in mean fitness than spatially uniform population expansions. The adaptation gain results from  soft selective sweeps emerging from surfing beneficial mutations. The rate of these surfing events is shown to sensitively depend on the strength of genetic drift, which varies among strains and environmental conditions. More generally, allele surfing promotes the rate of adaptation per biomass produced, which could help developing biofilms and other resource-limited populations to cope with environmental challenges.",

    "abstract": "Recently emerging methodology for generating human tissues in vitro has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery and disease research. Currently, three-dimensional cell culture models either rely on the pronounced ability of mammalian cells to self organize in vitro1-6, or use bioengineered constructs to arrange cells in an organ-like configuration7,8. While self-organizing organoids can recapitulate developmental events at a remarkable level of detail, bioengineered constructs excel at reproducibly generating tissue of a desired architecture. Here, we combine these two approaches to reproducibly generate micropatterned human forebrain tissue while maintaining its self-organizing capacity. We utilize poly(lactide-co-glycolide) copolymer (PLGA) fiber microfilaments as a scaffold to generate elongated embryoid bodies and demonstrate that this influences tissue identity. Micropatterned engineered cerebral organoids (enCORs) display enhanced neuroectoderm formation and improved cortical development. Furthermore, we reconstitute the basement membrane at later stages leading to characteristic cortical tissue architecture including formation of a polarized cortical plate and radial units. enCORs provide the first in vitro system for modelling the distinctive radial organization of the cerebral cortex and allow for the study of neuronal migration. We demonstrate their utility by modelling teratogenic effects of ethanol and show that defects in leading process formation may be responsible for the neuronal migration deficits in fetal alcohol syndrome. Our data demonstrate that combining 3D cell culture with bioengineering can significantly enhance tissue identity and architecture, and establish organoid models for teratogenic compounds.",

    "abstract": "The challenges posed by large data volumes produced by high-throughput nucleotide sequencing technologies are well known. This document establishes ten simple rules for coping with these challenges. At the level of master data management, (1) data triage reduces data volumes; (2) some lossless data representations are much more compact than others; (3) careful management of data replication reduces wasted storage space. At the level of data analysis, (4) automated analysis pipelines obviate the need for storing work files; (5) virtualization reduces the need for data movement and bandwidth consumption; (6) tracking of data and analysis provenance will generate a paper trail to better understand how results were produced. At the level of data access and sharing, (7) careful modeling of data movement patterns reduces bandwidth consumption and haphazard copying; (8) persistent, resolvable identifiers for data reduce ambiguity caused by data movement; (9) sufficient metadata enables more effective collaboration. Finally, because of rapid developments in HTS technologies, (10) agile practices that combine loosely coupled modules operating on standards-compliant data are the best approach for avoiding lock-in. A generalized scenario is presented for data management from initial raw data generation to publication of result data.",

    "abstract": "ESCRT-III proteins have been implicated in sealing the nuclear envelope in mammals, spindle pole body dynamics in fission yeast, and surveillance of defective nuclear pore complexes in budding yeast. Here, we report that Lem2p (LEM2), a member of the LEM (Lap2-Emerin-Man1) family of inner nuclear membrane proteins, and the ESCRT-II/ESCRT-III hybrid protein Cmp7p (CHMP7), work together to recruit additional ESCRT-III proteins to holes in the nuclear membrane. In S. pombe, deletion of the ATPase vps4 leads to severe defects in nuclear morphology and integrity. These phenotypes are suppressed by loss-of-function mutations that arise spontaneously in lem2 or cmp7, implying that these proteins may function upstream in the same pathway. Building on these genetic interactions, we explored the role of LEM2 during nuclear envelope reformation in human cells. We found that CHMP7 and LEM2 enrich at the same region of the chromatin disc periphery during this window of cell division, and that CHMP7 can bind directly to the C-terminal domain of LEM2 in vitro. We further found that, during nuclear envelope formation, recruitment of the ESCRT factors CHMP7, CHMP2A and IST1/CHMP8 all depend on LEM2 in human cells. We conclude that Lem2p/LEM2 is a conserved nuclear site-specific adaptor that recruits Cmp7p/CHMP7 and downstream ESCRT factors to the nuclear envelope.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial lipoproteins are a class of extracellular proteins tethered to cell membranes by covalently attached lipids. Deleting the lipoprotein signal peptidase (lsp) gene in Streptomyces coelicolor results in growth and developmental defects that cannot be restored by reintroducing the lsp. We report resequencing of the genomes of the wild-type M145 and the cis-complemented {Delta}lsp mutant (BJT1004), mapping and identifying secondary mutations, including an insertion into a novel putative small RNA, scr6809. Disruption of scr6809 led to a range of developmental phenotypes. However, these secondary mutations do not increase the efficiency of disrupting lsp suggesting they are not lsp specific suppressors. Instead we suggest that these were induced by introducing the cosmid St4A10{Delta}lsp as part of the Redirect mutagenesis protocol, which transiently duplicates a number of important cell division genes. Disruption of lsp using no gene duplication resulted in the previously observed phenotype. We conclude that lsp is not essential in S. coelicolor but loss of lsp does lead to developmental defects due to the loss of lipoproteins from the cell. Significantly, our results indicate the use of cosmid libraries for the genetic manipulation of bacteria can lead to unexpected phenotypes not necessarily linked to the gene or pathway of interest.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is associated with abnormal beta oscillations (13-30 Hz) in the basal ganglia and motor cortex (M1). Recent reports show that M1 beta-high gamma (50-200 Hz) phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is exaggerated in PD and is reduced following acute deep brain stimulation (DBS). Here we analyze invasive M1 electrocorticography recordings in PD patients on and off DBS, and in isolated cervical dystonia patients, and show that M1 beta oscillations are nonsinusoidal, having sharp and asymmetric features. These sharp oscillatory beta features underlie the previously reported PAC, providing an alternative to the standard interpretation of PAC as an interaction between two distinct frequency components. Specifically, the ratio between peak and trough sharpness is nearly perfectly correlated with beta-high gamma PAC (r = 0.96) and predicts PD-related motor deficit. Using a simulation of the local field potential, we demonstrate that sharp oscillatory waves can arise from synchronous synaptic activity. We propose that exaggerated beta-high gamma PAC may actually reflect such synchronous synaptic activity, manifesting as sharp beta oscillations that are \\\"smoothed out\\\" with DBS. These results support the \\\"desynchronization\\\" hypothesis of DBS wherein DBS counteracts pathological synchronization throughout the basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop. We argue that PAC can be influenced by more than one mechanism. In this case synaptic synchrony, rather than the often assumed spike-field coherence, may underlie exaggerated PAC. These often overlooked temporal features of the oscillatory waveform carry critical physiological information about neural processes and dynamics that may lead to better understanding of underlying neuropathology.",

A major challenge at the interface of developmental and systems neuroscience is to relate this spatiotempo-ral trajectory of maturation to circuit-level functional organization. This study examined the development of two ocular cranial motor nuclei (nIII and nIV), structures in which a motoneurons identity, or choice of muscle partner, defines its behavioral role. We used retro-orbital dye fills, in combination with fluorescent markers for motoneuron location and birth-date, to probe spatial and temporal organization of the oculomotor (nIII) and trochlear (nIV) nuclei in the larval zebrafish. We described a dorsoventral organization of the four nIII motoneuron pools, in which inferior and medial rectus motoneurons occupy dorsal nIII, while inferior oblique and superior rectus motoneurons occupy distinct divisions of ventral nIII. Dorsal nIII motoneurons are, moreover, born before motoneurons of ventral nIII and nIV. Order of neurogenesis can therefore account for the dorsoventral organization of nIII and may play a primary role in determining motoneuron identity. We propose that the temporal development of ocular motoneurons plays a key role in assembling a functional oculomotor circuit.",

    "abstract": "Y chromosomal (Y-DNA) haplogroups are more widely used in population genetics than in genetic epidemiology, although associations between Y-DNA haplogroups and several traits (including cardio-metabolic traits) have been reported. In apparently homogeneous populations, there is still Y-DNA haplogroup variation which will result from population history. Therefore, hidden stratification and/or differential phenotypic effects by Y-DNA haplogroups could exist. To test this, we hypothesised that stratifying individuals according to their Y-DNA haplogroups before testing associations between autosomal SNPs and phenotypes will yield difference in association. For proof of concept, we derived Y-DNA haplogroups from 6,537 males from two epidemiological cohorts, ALSPAC (N=5,080, 816 Y-DNA SNPs) and 1958 Birth Cohort (N=1,457, 1,849 Y-DNA SNPs). For illustration, we studied well-known associations between 32 SNPs and body mass index (BMI), including associations involving FTO SNPs. Overall, no association was replicated in both cohorts when Y-DNA haplogroups were considered and this suggests that, for BMI at least, there is little evidence of differences in phenotype or gene association by Y-DNA structure. Further studies using other traits, Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), haplogroups and/or autosomal SNPs are required to test the generalisability of this approach.",
