    "abstract": "Norepinephrine/noradrenaline is a neurotransmitter implicated in arousal and other aspects of vertebrate behavior and physiology. In invertebrates, adrenergic signaling is considered absent and analogous functions are performed by the biogenic amines octopamine and its precursor tyramine. These chemically similar transmitters signal by related families of GPCR in vertebrates and invertebrates, suggesting that octopamine/tyramine are the invertebrate equivalents of vertebrate norepinephrine. However, the evolutionary relationships and origin of these transmitter systems remain unclear. Using phylogenetic analysis and receptor pharmacology, here we establish that norepinephrine, octopamine, and tyramine receptors coexist in some marine invertebrates. In the protostomes Platynereis dumerilii (an annelid) and Priapulus caudatus (a priapulid) we identified and pharmacologically characterized adrenergic 1 and 2 receptors that coexist with octopamine , octopamine {beta}, tyramine type 1, and tyramine 2 receptors. These receptors represent the first examples of adrenergic receptors in protostomes. In the deuterostome Saccoglossus kowalewskii (a hemichordate), we identified and characterized octopamine , octopamine {beta}, tyramine type 1, and tyramine 2 receptors, representing the first example of these receptors in deuterostomes. S. kowalewskii also has adrenergic 1 and 2 receptors, indicating that all three signaling systems coexist in this animal. In phylogenetic analysis, we also identified adrenergic and tyramine receptor orthologs in xenacoelomorphs. Our results clarify the history of monoamine signaling in bilaterians. Since all six receptor families (two each for octopamine and tyramine and three for norepinephrine) can be found in representatives of the two major clades of Bilateria, the protostomes and the deuterostomes, all six receptors coexisted in the protostome-deuterostome last common ancestor. Adrenergic receptors were lost from most insects and nematodes and tyramine and octopamine receptors were lost from most deuterostomes. This complex scenario of differential losses cautions that octopamine signaling in protostomes is not a good model for adrenergic signaling in deuterostomes, and that the studies of marine animals where all three transmitter systems coexist will be needed for a better understanding of the origin and ancestral functions of these transmitters.",

    "abstract": "Crop yield loss due to flooding is a threat to food security. Submergence-induced hypoxia in plants results in stabilisation of group VII ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTORS (ERF-VIIs), which aid survival under these adverse conditions. ERF-VII stability is controlled by the N-end rule pathway, which proposes that ERF-VII N-terminal cysteine oxidation in normoxia enables arginylation followed by proteasomal degradation. The PLANT CYSTEINE OXIDASEs (PCOs) have been identified as catalysts of this oxidation. ERF-VII stabilisation in hypoxia presumably arises from reduced PCO activity. We directly demonstrate that PCO dioxygenase activity produces Cys-sulfinic acid at the N-terminus of an ERF-VII peptide, which then undergoes efficient arginylation by an arginyl transferase (ATE1). This is the first molecular evidence showing N-terminal Cys-sulfinic acid formation and arginylation by N-end rule pathway components, and the first ATE1 substrate in plants. The PCOs and ATE1 may be viable intervention targets to stabilise N-end rule substrates, including ERF-VIIs to enhance submergence tolerance in agronomy.",

    "abstract": "Recent successes in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) make it possible to address important questions about the genetic architecture of complex traits, such as allele frequency and effect size. One lesser-known aspect of complex traits is the extent of allelic heterogeneity (AH) arising from multiple causal variants at a locus. We developed a computational method to infer the probability of AH and applied it to three GWAS and four expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets. We identified a total of 4152 loci with strong evidence of AH. The proportion of all loci with identified AH is 4-23% in eQTLs, 35% in GWAS of High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL), and 23% in schizophrenia. For eQTLs, we observed a strong correlation between sample size and the proportion of loci with AH (R2=0.85, P = 2.2e-16), indicating that statistical power prevents identification of AH in other loci. Understanding the extent of AH may guide the development of new methods for fine mapping and association mapping of complex traits.",

    "abstract": "Long-range inter-chromosomal interactions in the interphase nucleus subsume critical genome-level regulatory functions such as transcription and gene expression. To decipher the physical basis of diverse pan-nuclear patterns of chromosomal arrangement that facilitates these processes, we investigate the scaling effects within disparate genomes and compared their total number of genes with chromosome size. First, we derived the pan-nuclear average fractal dimension of inter-chromosomal arrangement in interphase nuclei of different species and corroborated our predictions with independently reported results. Then, we described the different patterns across disparate unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes. We report that, unicellular lower eukaryotes have inter-chromosomal fractal dimension = 1 at the pan-nuclear scales, which is analogous to the multi-polymer crumpled globule model. Multi-fractal dimensions, corresponding to different inter-chromosomal arrangements emerged from multicellular eukaryotes, such that closely related species have relatively similar patterns. Using this theoretical approach, we could distinguish fractal patterns from human acrocentric versus metacentric chromosomes, implying that the multi-fractal nature of inter-chromosomal geometry facilitates viable large-scale chromosomal aberrations, such as Robertsonian translocations. We report that the nature of such an average multi-fractal dimension for nocturnal mammals is very different in diurnal mammals, which suggests a greatly enhanced plasticity in arrangement across different cell types, for example retinal versus dermal fibroblasts. Altogether, our results substantiate that genome-level constraints have also co-evolved with the average pan-nuclear fractal dimension of inter-chromosomal folding during eukaryotic evolution.",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in brain organization exist at many spatial and temporal scales, contributing to the substantial heterogeneity underlying human thought and behavior. Oscillatory neural activity is crucial for these behaviors, but how such rhythms are expressed across the cortex within and across individuals has not been thoroughly characterized. Combining electroencephalography (EEG) with representational similarity and multivariate classification techniques, we provide a systematic characterization of brain-wide activity across frequency bands and oscillatory features during rest and task performance. Results indicate that oscillatory profiles exhibit sizable group-level correspondences, indicating the presence of common templates of oscillatory organization. At the same time, we observed well-defined subject-specific network profiles that were discernible above and beyond the structure shared across individuals. These individualized patterns were sufficiently stable over time to allow successful classification of individuals several months later. Finally, our findings indicate that the network structure of rhythmic activity varies considerably across distinct oscillatory frequencies and features, suggesting the existence of multiple, parallel information processing streams embedded in distributed electrophysiological activity. Together, these findings affirm the richness of spatiotemporal EEG signals and emphasize the utility of multivariate network analyses for understanding the role of brain oscillations in physiology and behavior.",

    "abstract": "The superior colliculus (SC) is an integrative sensorimotor structure that contributes to multiple visiondependent behaviors. It is a laminated structure; the superficial SC layers (sSC) contain cells that respond to visual stimuli, while the deep SC layers (dSC) contain cells that also respond to auditory and somatosensory stimuli. Despite the increasing interest in mice for visual system study, the differences in the visual response properties between the sSC and the dSC are largely unknown. Here we used a large-scale silicon probe recording system to examine the visual response properties of neurons within the SC of head-fixed, awake and behaving mice. We find that both the sSC and dSC cells respond to visual stimuli, but dSC cells have three key differences. (1) The majority of the dSC orientation/direction selective (OS/DS) cells have their firing rate suppressed by drifting sinusoidal gratings (negative OS/DS cells) rather than being stimulated like the sSC cells (positive OS/DS cells). (2) Almost all the dSC cells have complex-cell-like spatial summation nonlinearity, and a significantly smaller fraction of the positive OS/DS cells in the dSC respond to flashing spots than those in the sSC. (3) The dSC cells lack Y-like spatial summation nonlinearity unlike the sSC cells. These results provide the first description of cells that are suppressed by a visual stimulus with a specific orientation or direction, show that neurons in the dSC have properties analogous to cortical complex cells, and show the presence of Y-like nonlinearity in the sSC but their absence in the dSC.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe superior colliculus receives visual input from the retina in its superficial layers (sSC) and induces eye/head orientating movements and innate defensive responses in its deeper layers (dSC). Despite their importance, very little is known about the visual response properties of dSC neurons. Using highdensity electrode recordings and novel model-based analysis, we find that the dSC contains cells with a novel property; they are suppressed by the orientation or direction of specific stimuli. We also show that dSC cells have properties similar to cortical \\\"complex\\\" cells. Conversely, cells with Y-like nonlinear spatial summation properties are located only in the sSC. These findings contribute to our understanding of how the SC processes visual inputs, a critical step in comprehending visually-guided behaviors.\\n\\nAcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Brain Research Seed Funding provided by UCSC and from the National Institutes of Health Grant NEI R21EYO26758 to D.

    "abstract": "The principle of maximum entropy provides a useful method for inferring statistical mechanics models from observations in correlated systems, and is widely used in a variety of fields where accurate data are available. While the assumptions underlying maximum entropy are intuitive and appealing, its adequacy for describing complex empirical data has been little studied in comparison to alternative approaches. Here data from the collective spiking activity of retinal neurons is reanalysed. The accuracy of the maximum entropy distribution constrained by mean firing rates and pairwise correlations is compared to a random ensemble of distributions constrained by the same observables. In general, maximum entropy approximates the true distribution better than the typical or mean distribution from that ensemble. This advantage improves with population size, with groups as small as 8 being almost always better described by maximum entropy. Failure of maximum entropy to outperform random models is found to be associated with strong correlations in the population.",

    "abstract": "The storage and persistence of memories depends on plasticity in the hippocampus. Adult neurogenesis produces new neurons that mature through critical periods for plasticity and cellular survival, which determine their contributions to learning and memory. However, most granule neurons are generated prior to adulthood; the maturational timecourse of these neurons is poorly understood compared to adult-born neurons, but is essential to identify how the dentate gyrus, as a whole, contributes to behavior. To characterize neurons born in the early postnatal period, we labeled dentate gyrus neurons born on postnatal day 6 (P6) with BrdU and quantified maturation and survival across early (1 hour to 8 weeks old) and late (2-6 months old) cell ages. We find that the dynamics of developmentally-born neuron survival is essentially the opposite of neurons born in adulthood: P6-born neurons did not go through a period of cell death during their immature stages (from 1-8 weeks). In contrast, 17% of P6-born neurons died after reaching maturity, between 2-6 months of age. Delayed death was evident from the loss of BrdU+ cells as well as pyknotic BrdU+caspase3+ neurons within the superficial granule cell layer. Patterns of DCX, NeuN and activity-dependent Fos expression indicate that developmentally-born neurons mature over several weeks and a sharp peak in zif268 expression at 2 weeks suggests that developmentally-born neurons mature faster than adult-born neurons (which peak at 3 weeks). Collectively, our findings are relevant for understanding how developmentally-born dentate gyrus neurons contribute to memory and disorders throughout the lifespan. High levels of early survival and zif268 expression may promote learning, while also rendering neurons sensitive to insults at defined stages. Late neuronal death in young adulthood may result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of dentate gyrus neurons, which could impact memory persistence and contribute to hippocampal/dentate gyrus atrophy in disorders such as depression.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation in collective action dilemmas usually breaks down in the absence of additional incentive mechanisms. This tragedy can be escaped if cooperators have the possibility to invest in reward funds that are shared exclusively among cooperators(prosocial rewarding). Yet, the presence of defectors who do not contribute to the public good but do reward themselves(antisocial rewarding) deters cooperation in the absence of additional countermeasures. A recent simulation study suggests that spatial structure is sufficient to prevent antisocial rewarding from deterring cooperation. Here we reinvestigate this issue assuming mixed strategies and weak selection on a game-theoretic model of social interactions, which we also validate using individual-based simulations. We show that increasing reward funds facilitates the maintenance of prosocial rewarding but prevents its evolution from rare, and that spatial structure can sometimes select against the evolution of prosocial rewarding. Our results suggest that, even in spatially structured populations, additional mechanisms are required to prevent antisocial rewarding from deterring cooperation in public goods dilemmas.",

    "abstract": "Cell-based models provide a powerful computational tool for studying the mechanisms underlying the growth and dynamics of biological tissues in health and disease. An increasing amount of quantitative data with cellular resolution has paved the way for the quantitative parameterisation and validation of such models. However, the numerical implementation of cell-based models remains challenging, and little work has been done to understand to what extent implementation choices may influence model predictions. Here, we consider the numerical implementation of a popular class of cell-based models called vertex models, which are often used to study epithelial tissues. In two-dimensional vertex models, a tissue is approximated as a tessellation of polygons and the vertices of these polygons move due to mechanical forces originating from the cells. Such models have been used extensively to study the mechanical regulation of tissue topology in the literature. Here, we analyse how the model predictions may be affected by numerical parameters, such as the size of the time step, and non-physical model parameters, such as length thresholds for cell rearrangement. We find that vertex positions and summary statistics are sensitive to several of these implementation parameters. For example, the predicted tissue size decreases with decreasing cell cycle durations, and cell rearrangement may be suppressed by large time steps. These findings are counter-intuitive and illustrate that model predictions need to be thoroughly analysed and implementation details carefully considered when applying cell-based computational models in a quantitative setting.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing has yet to be widely adopted for HIV. The difficulty of accurately reconstructing the consensus sequence of a quasispecies from reads (short fragments of DNA) in the presence of rapid between- and within-host evolution may have presented a barrier. In particular, mapping (aligning) reads to a reference sequence leads to biased loss of information; this bias can distort epidemiological and evolutionary conclusions. De novo assembly avoids this bias by effectively aligning the reads to themselves, producing a set of sequences called contigs. However contigs provide only a partial summary of the reads, misassembly may result in their having an incorrect structure, and no information is available at parts of the genome where contigs could not be assembled. To address these problems we developed the tool shiver to preprocess reads for quality and contamination, then map them to a reference tailored to the sample using corrected contigs supplemented with existing reference sequences. Run with two commands per sample, it can easily be used for large heterogeneous data sets. We use shiver to reconstruct the consensus sequence and minority variant information from paired-end short-read data produced with the Illumina platform, for 65 existing publicly available samples and 50 new samples. We show the systematic superiority of mapping to shivers constructed reference over mapping the same reads to the standard reference HXB2: an average of 29 bases per sample are called differently, of which 98.5% are supported by higher coverage. We also provide a practical guide to working with imperfect contigs.",

    "abstract": "Microbes produce metabolic resources that are important for cell growth yet leak across membranes into the extracellular environment. Other microbes in the same environment can use these resources and adjust their own metabolic production accordingly--causing other resources to leak into the environment. The combined effect of these processes is an economy in which organismal growth and metabolic production are coupled to others in the community. We propose a model for the co-evolving dynamics of metabolite concentrations, production regulation, and population frequencies for the case of two cell types, each requiring and capable of producing two metabolites. In this model, beneficial trade relations emerge without any coordination, via individual-level production decisions that maximize each cells growth rate given its perceived environment. As we vary production parameters of the model, we encounter three paradoxical behaviors, where a change that should intuitively benefit some cell type, actually harms it. (1) If a cell type is more efficient than its counterpart at producing a metabolite and becomes even more efficient, its frequency in the population can decrease. (2) If a cell type is less efficient than its counterpart at producing a metabolite but becomes less inefficient, the growth rate of the population can decrease. (3) Finally, if a cell type controls its counterparts production decisions so as to maximize its own growth rate, the ultimate growth rate it achieves can be lower than if the two cell types each maximized their own growth. These three paradoxes highlight the complex and counter-intuitive dynamics that emerge in simple microbial economies.",

Within most major clades, body size distributions follow a right-skewed pattern where most species are relatively small while a few are orders of magnitude larger than the median size. Using a novel database of 742 extant and extinct primate species sizes over the past 66 million years, we find that primates exhibit the opposite pattern: a left-skewed distribution. We investigate the long-term evolution of this distribution, first showing that the initial size radiation is consistent with plesiadapiformes (an extinct group with an uncertain ancestral relationship to primates) being ancestral to modern primates. We calculate the strength of Copes Rule, showing an initial tendency for descendants to increase in size relative to ancestors until the trend reverses 40 million years ago. We explore when the primate size distribution becomes left-skewed and study correlations between body size patterns and climactic trends, showing that across Old and New World radiations the body size distribution initially exhibits a right-skewed pattern. Left-skewness emerged early in Old World primates in a manner consistent with a previously unidentified possible maximum body size, which may be mechanistically related to primates encephalization and complex social groups.",

    "abstract": "The problem of \\\"missing heritability\\\" in genome-wide analyses of complex diseases is thought to be attributable to some combination of: rare variants of moderate to large effect, common variants of very small effect, and epigenetic, epistatic, or shared environmental effects. Rare variants do not affect large numbers of people by definition, but identified genes and pathways frequently lead to important insights into pathogenesis, and become targets of chemoprevention or therapy. Family studies remain an efficient way to identify rare variants with sizable effects on disease risk. We present a genome-wide study of breast cancer in 22 large high-risk families including 154 women diagnosed with breast cancer. Appropriate marker spacing was achieved by simulation studies of founder haplotypes to reduce the chance that linkage disequilibrium produced spurious linkage peaks. For each family, we generated 100 simulations of null linkage genome-wide to estimate the probability that individual results were due to chance. We identified a total of 12 putative susceptibility regions with per-family genome-wide probability < 0.05. These regions were located on 10 chromosomes; 10 of the 22 families showed linkage at these locations; two or more families showed linkage to 6 regions on 5 chromosomes (4q, 5q, 6p, 14q, 18p, and 18q). These results indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity among families in genomic regions and thus variants predisposing to breast cancer. Moreover, they suggest that uncommon high- or medium-risk genetic variants remain to be found, and that family designs can be an efficient way to identify them.",

We focus on the case in which subgroup-specific models may be expected to be similar but not necessarily identical. Our approach is to treat subgroups as related problem instances and jointly estimate subgroup-specific regression coefficients. This is done in a penalized framework, combining an{ell} 1 term with an additional term that penalizes differences between subgroup-specific coefficients. This gives solutions that are globally sparse but that allow information-sharing between the subgroups. We present algorithms for estimation and empirical results on simulated data and using Alzheimers disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and cancer datasets. These examples demonstrate the gains our approach can offer in terms of prediction and the ability to estimate subgroup-specific sparsity patterns.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the human DYNC1H1 gene are associated with neurological diseases. DYNC1H1 encodes the heavy chain of cytoplasmic dynein-1, a 1.4 MDa motor complex that traffics organelles, vesicles and macromolecules towards microtubule minus ends. The effects of the DYNC1H1 mutations on dynein motility, and consequently their links to neuropathology, are not understood. Here, we address this issue using a recombinant expression system for human dynein coupled to single-molecule resolution in vitro motility assays. We functionally characterise 14 DYNC1H1 mutations identified in humans diagnosed with malformations in cortical development (MCD) or spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance (SMALED), as well as three mutations that cause motor and sensory defects in mice. Two of the human mutations, R1962C and H3822P, strongly interfere with dyneins core mechanochemical properties. The remaining mutations selectively compromise the processive mode of dynein movement that is activated by binding to the accessory complex dynactin and the cargo adaptor BICD2. Mutations with the strongest effects on dynein motility in vitro are associated with MCD. The vast majority of mutations do not affect binding of dynein to dynactin and BICD2, and are therefore expected to result in linkage of cargoes to dynein-dynactin complexes that have defective long-range motility. This observation offers an explanation for the dominant effects of DYNC1H1 mutations in vivo. Collectively, our results suggest that compromised processivity of cargo-motor assemblies contributes to human neurological disease and provide insight into the influence of different regions of the heavy chain on dynein motility.",

PSSM allows the detection of more distant homologs than a general amino acid substitution matrix does. An accurate estimation of the weights of sequences in an MSA is crucially important for PSSM construction. PSI-BLAST divides a given MSA into multiple blocks, for which sequence weights are calculated. When the block width becomes very narrow, the sequence weight calculation can be difficult.\\n\\nWe demonstrate that PSI-BLAST indeed generates a significant fraction of blocks having widths less than 5, thereby degrading the PSI-BLAST performance. We revised the code of PSI-BLAST to prevent the blocks from being narrower than a given minimum block width (MBW). We designate the modified application of PSI-BLAST as PSI-BLASTexB. When MBW is 25, PSI-BLASTexB notably outperforms PSI-BLAST consistently for three independent benchmark sets. The performance boost is even more drastic when an MSA, instead of a sequence, was used as a query.\\n\\nOur results demonstrate that the generation of narrow-width blocks during the sequence weight calculation is a critically important factor that restricts the PSI-BLAST search performance.

For 108 eukaryotic effectors, LOCALIZER outperforms other methods and predicts a previously unrecognized chloroplast transit peptide for the ToxA effector, which we show translocates into tobacco chloroplasts. Secretome-wide predictions and confocal microscopy reveal that rust fungi might have evolved multiple effectors that target chloroplasts or nuclei.

Phenotypic variability, whereby a single genotype can express multiple different phenotypes, might play an important role in rescuing such populations from extinction. This type of evolutionary bet-hedging need not confer a direct benefit to a single individual, but it may increase the chance of long-term survival of a lineage. Here we develop a population-genetic model to explore how partly heritable phenotypic variability influences the probability of evolutionary rescue and the mean duration of population persistence in changing environments. We find that the probability of population persistence depends non-monotonically on the degree of phenotypic heritability between generations: some heritability can help avert extinction, but too much heritability removes any benefit of phenotypic variability. We discuss the implications of these results in the context of therapies designed to eradicate populations of pathogens or aberrant cellular lineages.",

While the Red Queen hypothesis provides a reasonable explanation for recombination, it requires coevolution with antagonistic species, such as host-parasite systems. We present a novel scenario for the evolution of recombination in changing environments: the genomic storage effect due to phenotypic plasticity. Using an analytic approximation and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that recombination evolves between a target locus that determines fitness, and a modifier locus that modulates the effects of alleles at the target. Evolution of recombination by this plasticity effect does not require antagonistic inter-specific interactions and, unlike in previous models, it occurs when only one target locus codes for a trait under selection. Furthermore, if the effects of multiple target loci are modified by the same plasticity locus, then the recombination rate among the target loci will tend to decrease, clustering the loci that influence a trait. These results provide a novel scenario for the evolution of recombination, highlighting the importance of phenotypic plasticity for recombination modification.",

    "abstract": "Despite a cumulative body of knowledge describing short-range cell interactions in morphogenetic processes, relatively little is known on the mechanism involved in the long-range spatial and temporal coordination of cells to build functional and structurally organized tissues. In particular, the attainment of a functionally optimized epithelia must require directional cues to instruct cell movements and cell orientations throughout the tissue field. In Drosophila, the adult epidermis of the abdominal segments is created de novo by the replacement of obsolete larval epidermal cells (LECs) by histoblasts (imaginal founder cells). As these proliferate, expand and fuse, they uniformly organize orienting on the surface along the antero-posterior axis. We found that the coordinated, axially oriented changes in shape of histoblasts respond to a dynamic, yet stereotyped redesign of the epithelial field mediated by the Dachsous/Fat/Four-jointed (Ds/Ft/Fj) pathway. The establishment and refinement of the expression gradients of the atypical cadherins Ds and Ft result in their axial polarization across cell interfaces and differential adhesiveness. We suggest that the role of Ds/Ft/Fj in long-range axially oriented planar cell alignment is a general function and that the regulation of the expression of its components would be crucial in the achievement of tissue uniformity in many other morphogenetic models or during tissue repair.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems defend microbes against foreign nucleic acids via RNA-guided endonucleases. Using a computational sequence database mining approach, we identify two Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems (subtype VI-B) that lack Cas1 and Cas2 and encompass a single large effector protein, Cas13b, along with one of two previously uncharacterized associated proteins, Csx27 or Csx28. We establish that these CRISPR-Cas systems can achieve RNA interference when heterologously expressed. Through a combination of biochemical and genetic experiments, we show that Cas13b processes its own CRISPR array with short and long direct repeats, cleaves target RNA, and exhibits collateral RNase activity. Using an E. coli essential gene screen, we demonstrate that Cas13b has a double-sided protospacer-flanking sequence and elucidate RNA secondary structure requirements for targeting. We also find that Csx27 represses, whereas Csx28 enhances, Cas13b-mediated RNA interference. Characterization of these CRISPR systems creates opportunities to develop tools to manipulate and monitor cellular transcripts.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal activity generates ionic flows and thereby both magnetic fields and electric potential differences, i.e. voltages. Voltage measurements are widely used, but suffer from isolating and smearing properties of tissue between source and sensor, are blind to ionic flow direction, and reflect the difference between two electrodes, complicating interpretation. Magnetic field measurements could overcome these limitations, but have been essentially limited to magnetoencephalography (MEG), using centimeter-sized, helium-cooled extracranial sensors. Here, we report on in vivo magnetic recordings of neuronal activity from visual cortex of cats with magnetrodes, specially developed needle-shaped probes carrying micron-sized, non-cooled magnetic sensors based on spin electronics. Event-related magnetic fields inside the neuropil were on the order of several nanoteslas, informing MEG source models and efforts for magnetic field measurements through MRI. Though the signal-to-noise ratio is still inferior to electrophysiology, this proof of concept demonstrates the potential to exploit the fundamental advantages of magnetophysiology.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LISpin-electronics based probes achieve local magnetic recordings inside the neuropil\\nC_LIO_LIMagnetic field recordings were performed in vivo, in anesthetized cat visual cortex\\nC_LIO_LIEvent-related fields (ERFs) to visual stimuli were up to several nanoteslas in size\\nC_LIO_LIERFs could be detected after averaging less than 20 trials\\nC_LI\\n\\nIN BRIEFCaruso et al. report in vivo, intra-cortical recordings of magnetic fields that reflect neuronal activity, using magnetrodes, i.e. micron size magnetic sensors based on spin electronics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStructural variants (SVs) in human genomes are implicated in a variety of human diseases. Long-read sequencing delivers much longer read lengths than short-read sequencing and may greatly improve SV detection. However, due to the relatively high cost of long-read sequencing, it is unclear what coverage is needed and how to optimally use the aligners and SV callers.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we developed NextSV, a meta-caller to perform SV calling from low coverage long-read sequencing data. NextSV integrates three aligners and three SV callers and generates two integrated call sets (sensitive/stringent) for different analysis purposes. We evaluated SV calling performance of NextSV under different PacBio coverages on two personal genomes, NA12878 and HX1. Our results showed that, compared with running any single SV caller, NextSV stringent call set had higher precision and balanced accuracy (F1 score) while NextSV sensitive call set had a higher recall. At 10X coverage, the recall of NextSV sensitive call set was 93.5% to 94.1% for deletions and 87.9% to 93.2% for insertions, indicating that ~10X coverage might be an optimal coverage to use in practice, considering the balance between the sequencing costs and the recall rates. We further evaluated the Mendelian errors on an Ashkenazi Jewish trio dataset.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results provide useful guidelines for SV detection from low coverage whole-genome PacBio data and we expect that NextSV will facilitate the analysis of SVs on long-read sequencing data.",

    "abstract": "Regeneration requires the precise integration of cues that initiate proliferation, direct differentiation, and ultimately re-pattern tissues to the proper size and scale. Yet how these processes are integrated with wounding cues remains relatively unknown. The freshwater planarian, Schmidtea mediterranea, is an ideal model to study the stereotyped proliferative and transcriptional responses to injury due to its high capacity for regeneration. Here, we characterize the effector of the Hippo signalling cascade, yorkie, during planarian regeneration and its role in restricting early injury responses. In yki(RNAi) regenerating animals, wound responses are hyper-activated; the bimodal proliferation kinetics are heighted and prolonged, while the transcriptional injury responses are similarly augmented with dysregulated temporal patterns. We also uncovered novel wound-induced genes by RNAseq that are primarily associated with tissue patterning. Indeed, a high proportion of non-wound- and wound-induced patterning molecules are mis-expressed in yki(RNAi), which we demonstrate is in part due to an expanded muscle cell population. These altered injury responses have consequential effects on regenerative outcomes, specifically sensing the size of a given injury and appropriately scaling organ and tissue sizes. Taken together, our results suggest that yki functions as a key node to integrate the injury responses of proliferation, apoptosis, injury-induced transcription, and patterning to coordinate regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Species interactions, environmental conditions, and stochastic processes work in concert to bring about changes in community structure. However, the relative importance of specific factors and how their combined influence affects community composition remain largely unclear. We conducted a multi-factorial experiment to 1) disentangle the direct and interaction-mediated effects of environmental conditions and 2) augment our understanding of how environmental context modulates species interactions. We focus on a planktonic system where interactions with phytoplankton effect changes in the composition of bacterial communities, and light and temperature conditions can influence bacteria directly as well as through their interactions with phytoplankton. Epilimnetic bacteria from two humic lakes were combined with phytoplankton assemblages from each lake (\\\"home\\\" or \\\"away\\\") or a no-phytoplankton control and incubated for 5 days under all combinations of light (surface, [~]25% surface irradiance) and temperature (5 levels from 10{degrees}C to 25{degrees}C). Observed light effects were primarily direct while phytoplankton and temperature effects on bacterial community composition were highly interdependent. The influence of temperature on aquatic bacteria was consistently mediated by phytoplankton and most pronounced for bacteria incubated with \\\"away\\\" phytoplankton treatments, likely due to the availability of novel phytoplankton-derived resources. The effects of phytoplankton on bacterial community composition were generally increased at higher temperatures. Incorporating mechanisms underlying the observed interdependent effects of species interactions and environmental conditions into modeling frameworks may improve our ability to forecast ecological responses to environmental change.",

    "abstract": "The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes play an essential role in immune function. Typing of HLA alleles is critical for transplantation and is informative for many disease associations. The high cost of accurate lab-based HLA typing has precluded its use in large-scale disease-association studies. The development of statistical methods to type alleles using linkage disequilibrium with nearby SNPs, called HLA imputation, has allowed large cohorts of individuals to be typed accurately, so that massive numbers of affected individuals and controls may be studied. This has resulted in many important findings. Several HLA imputation methods have been widely used, however their relative performance has not been adequately addressed. We have conducted a comprehensive study to evaluate the most widely used HLA imputation methods. We assembled a multi-ethnic panel of 10,561 individuals with SNP genotype data and lab-based typing of alleles at 11 HLA genes at two-field resolution, and used it to train and validate each method. Use of this panel leads to imputation accuracy far superior to what is currently publicly available. We present a highly-accurate new imputation method, HLA*IMP:03. We address the question of optimal use of HLA imputations in tests of genetic association, showing that it is usually not necessary to apply a probability threshold to achieve maximal power. We also investigated the effect on accuracy of SNP density and population stratification at the continental level and show that neither of these are a significant concern.",
