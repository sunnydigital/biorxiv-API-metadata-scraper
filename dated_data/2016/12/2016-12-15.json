    "abstract": "The ability to manipulate sequence, alignment, and phylogenetic tree files has become an increasingly important skill in the life sciences, whether to generate summary information or to prepare data for further downstream analysis. The command line can be an extremely powerful environment for interacting with these resources, but only if the user has the appropriate general-purpose tools on hand. BuddySuite is a collection of four independent yet interrelated command-line toolkits that facilitate each step in the workflow of sequence discovery, curation, alignment, and phylogenetic reconstruction. Most common sequence, alignment, and tree file formats are automatically detected and parsed, and over 100 tools have been implemented for manipulating these data. The project has been engineered to easily accommodate the addition of new tools, it is written in the popular programming language Python, and is hosted on the Python Package Index and GitHub to maximize accessibility. Documentation for each BuddySuite tool, including usage examples, is available at http://tiny.cc/buddysuite_wiki. All software is open source and freely available through http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/software/BuddySuite.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampus stores spatial representations, or maps, which are recalled each time a subject is placed in the corresponding environment. Across different environments of similar geometry, these representations show strong orthogonality in CA3 of hippocampus, whereas in the CA1 subfield a considerable overlap between the maps can be seen. The lower orthogonality decreases reliability of various decoders developed in an attempt to identify which of the stored maps is active at the mo-ment. Especially, the problem with decoding emerges with a need to analyze data at high temporal resolution. Here, we introduce a functional-connectivity-based de-coder, which accounts for the pairwise correlations between the spiking activities of neurons in each map and does not require any positional information, i.e. any knowledge about place fields. We first show, on recordings of hippocampal activity in constant environmental conditions, that our decoder outperforms existing decoding methods in CA1. Our decoder is then applied to data from teleportation experiments, in which an instantaneous switch between the environment identity triggers a recall of the corresponding spatial representation. We test the sensitivity of our approach on the transition dynamics between the respective memory states (maps). We find that the rate of spontaneous state shifts (flickering) after a teleportation event is increased not only within the first few seconds as already reported, but this instability is sustained across much longer (> 1 min.) periods.",

    "abstract": "Vaccines against Salmonella Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever, are commonly used by travellers, however, there are few examples of national immunization programs in endemic areas. There is therefore a paucity of data on the impact of typhoid immunization programs on localised populations of S. Typhi. Here we have used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to characterise 44 historical bacterial isolates collected before and after a national typhoid immunization program that was implemented in Thailand in 1977 in response to a large outbreak; the program was highly effective in reducing typhoid case numbers. Thai isolates were highly diverse, including 10 distinct phylogenetic lineages or genotypes. Novel prophage and plasmids were also detected, including examples that were previously only reported in Shigella sonnei and Escherichia coli. The majority of S. Typhi genotypes observed prior to the immunization program were not observed following it. Post-vaccine era isolates were more closely related to S. Typhi isolated from neighbouring countries than to earlier Thai isolates, providing no evidence for the local persistence of endemic S. Typhi following the national immunization program. Rather, later cases of typhoid appeared to be caused by the occasional importation of common genotypes from neighbouring Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. These data show the value of WGS in understanding the impacts of vaccination on pathogen populations and provide support for the proposal that large-scale typhoid immunization programs in endemic areas could result in lasting local disease elimination, although larger prospective studies are needed to test this directly.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTyphoid fever is a systemic infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. Typhoid fever is associated with inadequate hygiene in low-income settings and a lack of sanitation infrastructure. A sustained outbreak of typhoid fever occurred in Thailand in the 1970s, which peaked in 1975-1976. In response to this typhoid fever outbreak the government of Thailand initiated an immunization program, which resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of typhoid cases in Thailand. To better understand the population of S. Typhi circulating in Thailand at this time, as well as the impact of the immunization program on the pathogen population, we sequenced the genomes of 44 S. Typhi obtained from hospitals in Thailand before and after the immunization program. The genome sequences showed that isolates of S. Typhi bacteria isolated from post-immunization era typhoid cases were likely imported from neighbouring countries, rather than strains that have persisted in Thailand throughout the immunization period. Our work provides the first historical insights into S. Typhi in Thailand during the 1970s, and provides a model for the impact of immunization on S. Typhi populations.",

    "abstract": "Optimization of complex phenotypes in engineered microbial strains has traditionally been accomplished by laboratory evolution. However, only a subset of the resulting mutations may affect the phenotype of interest and many others may have unintended effects. Multiplexed genome editing can complement evolutionary approaches by creating diverse combinations of targeted changes, but in both cases it remains challenging to identify which alleles influence the desired phenotype. We present a method for identifying a minimal set of genomic modifications that optimizes a complex phenotype by combining iterative cycles of multiplex genome engineering and predictive modeling. We applied our method to the 63-codon E. coli strain C321.{Delta}A, which has 676 mutations relative to its wild-type ancestor, and identified six single nucleotide mutations that together recover 59% of the fitness defect exhibited by the strain. The resulting optimized strain, C321.DA.opt, is an improved chassis for production of proteins containing non-standard amino acids. Our data reveal how multiple cycles of multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) and inexpensive sequencing can generate rich genotypic and phenotypic diversity that can be combined with linear regression techniques to quantify individual allelic effects. While laboratory evolution relies on enrichment as a proxy for allelic effect, our model-guided approach is less susceptible than enrichment to bias from population dynamics and recombination efficiency. We also show that the method can identify beneficial de novo mutations that arise adventitiously. Beyond improving the fitness of C321, {Delta}A, our work provides a proof-of-principle for high-throughput quantification of individual allelic effects which can be used with any method for generating targeted genotypic diversity.",

    "abstract": "Recent genome-wide studies of both ancient and modern indigenous people of the Americas have shed light on the demographic processes involved during the first peopling. The Pacific northwest coast proves an intriguing focus for these studies due to its association with coastal migration models and genetic ancestral patterns that are difficult to reconcile with modern DNA alone. Here we report the genome-wide sequence of an ancient individual known as \\\"Shuka Kaa\\\" (\\\"Man Ahead of Us\\\") recovered from the On Your Knees Cave (OYKC) in southeastern Alaska (archaeological site 49-PET-408). The human remains date to approximately 10,300 cal years before present (BP). We also analyze low coverage genomes of three more recent individuals from the nearby coast of British Columbia dating from approximately 6075 to 1750 cal years BP. From the resulting time series of genetic data, we show that the Pacific Northwest Coast exhibits genetic continuity for at least the past 10,300 cal BP. We also infer that population structure existed in the late Pleistocene of North America with Shuka Kaa on a different ancestral line compared to other North American individuals (i.e., Anzick-1 and Kennewick Man) from the late Pleistocene or early Holocene. Despite regional shifts in mitochondrial DNA haplogroups we conclude from individuals sampled through time that people of the northern Northwest Coast belong to an early genetic lineage that may stem from a late Pleistocene coastal migration into the Americas.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe peopling of the Americas has been examined on the continental level with the aid of single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, next generation sequencing, and advancements in ancient DNA, all of which have helped elucidate major population movements. Regional paleogenomic studies, however, have received less attention and may reveal a more nuanced demographic history. Here we present genomewide sequences of individuals from the northern Northwest Coast covering a time span of ~10,000 years and show that continental patterns of demography do not necessarily apply on the regional level. In comparison with existing paleogenomic data, we demonstrate that geographically linked population samples from the Northwest Coast exhibit an early ancestral lineage and find that population structure existed among Native North American groups as early as the late Pleistocene.",

Expression and methylation quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs and cis-mQTLs) often occur at the same genomic location, suggesting a common causal variant and shared mechanism. Using DNA and RNA from peripheral blood of Bangladeshi individuals, we use \\\"co-localization\\\" methods to identify 3,695 eQTL-mQTL pairs that are likely to share a causal variant. Using partial correlation analysis and mediation analysis, we identify >500 pairs with evidence of a causal relationships between expression and methylation (i.e., shared mechanism) with many additional pairs that we are underpowered to detect. These co-localized pairs are enriched for SNPs showing opposite effects on expression and methylation, although a many affect multiple CpGs in opposite directions. Evidence of shared SNP-age interaction also supports shared mechanisms for two eQTL-mQTL pairs. This work demonstrates the pervasiveness of co-regulated expression and methylation traits in the human genome.

Development of assays of gonad physiology could indicate sex and maturation stage, as well as be used to assess the status of natural populations. Proteomic profiles were determined for three reproductive maturation stages in both male and female clams using data dependent acquisition (DDA) of gonad proteins. Gonad proteomes became increasingly divergent between males and females as maturation progressed. The DDA data was used to develop targets analyzed with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) in gonad tissue as well as hemolymph. The SRM assay yielded a suite of indicator peptides that can be used as an efficient assay to determine geoduck gonad maturation status. Application of SRM in hemolymph samples demonstrates this procedure could effectively be used to assess reproductive status in marine mollusks in a non-lethal manner.",

    "abstract": "A frequent event in the evolution of prokaryotic genomes is homologous recombination, where a foreign DNA stretch replaces a genomic region similar in sequence. Recombination can affect the relative position of two genomes in a phylogenetic reconstruction in two different ways: (i) one genome can recombine with a DNA stretch that is similar to the other genome, thereby reducing their pairwise sequence divergence; (ii) one genome can recombine with a DNA stretch from an outgroup genome, increasing the pairwise divergence. While several recombination-aware phylogenetic algorithms exist, many of these cannot account for both types of recombination; some algorithms can, but do so inefficiently. Moreover, many existing algorithms require that a substantial portion of each genome has not been affected by recombination, a sometimes unrealistic assumption. Here, we propose a novel coarse-graining approach for phylogenetic reconstruction (CGP), which is recombination-aware, applicable even if all genomic regions have experienced substantial amounts of recombination, and can be used on both nucleotide and amino acid sequences. CGP considers the local density of substitutions along pairwise genome alignments, fitting a model to the empirical distribution of substitution density to infer the pairwise coalescent time. Given all pairwise coalescent times, CGP reconstructs an ultrametric tree representing vertical inheritance. Based on simulations, we show that the proposed approach can reconstruct ultrametric trees with accurate topology, branch lengths, and root positioning. Applied to a set of E. coli strains, the reconstructed trees are most consistent with gene distributions when inferred from amino acid sequences, a data type that cannot be utilized by many alternative approaches.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIn homologous recombination, segments of foreign DNA overwrite similar segments of a prokaryotic genome. A single recombination event can simultaneously introduce many DNA substitutions. This disturbs phylogenetic signals, making it difficult to reconstruct prokaryotic family trees. While a handful of recombination-aware phylogenetic algorithms have been proposed, most do not take all effects of recombination into account; others rely on the frequently unrealistic assumption that a substantial part of a genome has not been affected by recombination at all. Here, we introduce a novel approach to phylogenetic reconstruction, which estimates the age of the most recent common ancestor of two strains from the density distribution of DNA or amino acid substitutions between their genomes. The proposed phylogenetic tree is the tree most compatible with these age estimates. Based on nucleotide or amino acid sequences, our approach accurately predicts the topology, branch lengths, and root positioning of prokaryotic family trees.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe identification of heterogeneities in cell populations by utilizing single-cell technologies such as single-cell RNA-Seq, enables inference of cellular development and lineage trees. Several methods have been proposed for such inference from high-dimensional single-cell data. They typically assign each cell to a branch in a differentiation trajectory. However, they commonly assume specific geometries such as tree-like developmental hierarchies and lack statistically sound methods to decide on the number of branching events.\\n\\nResultsWe present K-Branches, a solution to the above problem by locally fitting half-lines to single-cell data, introducing a clustering algorithm similar to K-Means. These halflines are proxies for branches in the differentiation trajectory of cells. We propose a modified version of the GAP statistic for model selection, in order to decide on the number of lines that best describe the data locally. In this manner, we identify the location and number of subgroups of cells that are associated with branching events and full differentiation, respectively. We evaluate the performance of our method on single-cell RNA-Seq data describing the differentiation of myeloid progenitors during hematopoiesis, single-cell qPCR data of mouse blastocyst development and artificial data.\\n\\nAvailabilityAn R implementation of K-Branches is freely available at https://github.com/theislab/kbranches\\n\\nContactfabian.theis@helmholtz-muenchen.de",

    "abstract": "Optogenetics promises spatiotemporal precise control of neural processes using light. However, the spatial extent of illumination within the brain is difficult to control and cannot be adjusted using standard fiber optics. We demonstrate that optical fibers with tapered tips can be used to illuminate either large brain volumes or dynamically selectable subregions. Remotely adjusting the light input angle to the fiber varies the light-emitting portion of the taper over several millimeters without movement of the implant. We use this mode to activate dorsal versus ventral striatum of individual mice and reveal different effects of each manipulation on motor behavior. Conversely injecting light over the full numerical aperture of the fiber results in light emission from the entire taper surface, achieving broader and more efficient optogenetic activation of neurons when compared to the standard flat-faced fiber stimulation. Thus, tapered fibers permit focal or broad illumination that can be precisely and dynamically matched to experimental needs.",

    "abstract": "We outline what we believe could be an improvement in future discussions of the brain acting as a Bayesian-Laplacian system. We do so by distinguishing between two broad classes of priors on which the brains inferential systems operate: in one category are biological priors ({beta} priors) and in the other artifactual ones ( priors). We argue that {beta} priors, of which colour categories and faces are good examples, are inherited or acquired very rapidly after birth, are highly or relatively resistant to change through experience, and are common to all humans. The consequence is that the probability of posteriors generated from {beta} priors having universal assent and agreement is high. By contrast,  priors, of which man-made objects are examples, are acquired post-natally and modified at various stages throughout post-natal life; they are much more accommodating of, and hospitable to, new experiences. Consequently, posteriors generated from them are less likely to find universal assent. Taken together, in addition to the more limited capacity of experiment and experience to alter the {beta} priors compared to  priors, another cardinal distinction between the two is that the probability of posteriors generated from {beta} priors having universal agreement is greater than that for  priors. The two categories are not, however, always totally distinct and can merge into one another to varying extents, resulting in posteriors that draw upon both categories.",

In two different, concurrent listening tasks, participants (n = 7) were fitted with individualized in-Ear-EEG pieces and were either asked to attend to one of two dichotically-presented, concurrent tone streams or to one of two diotically-presented, concurrent audiobooks. A forward encoding model was trained to predict the EEG response at single EEG channels. We found that all individual participants attentional focus could be predicted from single-channel EEG response recorded from short-distance configurations consisting only of a single in-Ear-EEG electrode and an adjacent scalp-EEG electrode. The responses to attended and ignored stimuli reveal differences consistent across subjects. In sum, our findings show that the EEG response from a single-channel, hearing-aid-compatible configuration provides valuable information to identify a listeners focus of attention.",

Here we reconstructed complete chloroplast genomes of over 1,800 accessions of wild and cultivated rice, including 240 aus and 73 aromatic varieties, and analysed the haplotype diversity of the taxonomic groups. We confirm the deep phylogenetic divergence between the main chloroplast haplotypes of japonica and indica, and reveal unique profiles of chloroplast diversity in aus and aromatic rice. Our results indicate that the latter two groups are not simple derivatives of indica and japonica, respectively, but originated from independent and/or reticulate domestication processes. Absence of phylogeographic patterns in the wild distribution of chloroplast haplogroups did not allow firm conclusions about geographic origins and the role of inter-group gene flow. Nonetheless, our results suggest that the domestication of indica, japonica, aus and aromatic rice operated on genetically different gene pools and followed different dynamics.",

Computational methods for detection of structural variants utilize paired-end mapping information, depth of coverage, split reads, or some combination of such data. The available methods are particularly designed to detect structural variants in single genomes or multiple genomes in a pairwise manner. The aim of this study was to develop a bioinformatics pipeline for detection of large structural variants using multiple pooled populations.\\n\\nResultsHere we describe the method \\\"DevRO\\\", developed to enable identification of structural variants using short insert paired-ends and long-range mate-pairs. DevRO uses paired-end mapping information from both types of libraries for identification of inversions, deletions and duplications followed by read depth information to screen for copy number variants. DevRO can detect structural variants in multiple populations without the need for pairwise comparisons. It uses a combined approach based on (i) paired-end mapping and (ii) depth of coverage that gives power to the study as compared to traditional methods that are based on either of these. DevRO is also designed to detect deletions in the reference assembly, which is an added functionality as compared to available methods.\\n\\nConclusionWe report a bioinformatics pipeline \\\"DevRO\\\" for detection of structural variants using paired-end mapping and depth of coverage methods tested on sequencing reads from multiple pooled rabbit populations. This method is useful when large numbers of populations have been re-sequenced as compared to traditional methods that can detect structural variants in a pairwise manner.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomes in proliferating metazoan cells undergo dramatic structural metamorphoses every cell cycle, alternating between a highly condensed mitotic structure facilitating chromosome segregation, and a decondensed interphase structure accommodating transcription, gene silencing and DNA replication. These cyclical structural transformations have been evident under the microscope for over a century, but their molecular-level analysis is still lacking. Here we use single-cell Hi-C to study chromosome conformations in thousands of individual cells, and discover a continuum of cis-interaction profiles that finely position individual cells along the cell cycle. We show that chromosomal compartments, topological domains (TADs), contact insulation and long-range loops, all defined by ensemble Hi-C maps, are governed by distinct cell cycle dynamics. In particular, DNA replication correlates with build-up of compartments and reduction in TAD insulation, while loops are generally stable from G1 through S and G2. Analysing whole genome 3D structural models using haploid cell data, we discover a radial architecture of chromosomal compartments with distinct epigenomic signatures. Our single-cell data creates an essential new paradigm for the re-interpretation of chromosome conformation maps through the prism of the cell cycle.",

Recent mathematical studies have identified constraints on FST that challenge interpretations of FST as a measure with potential to range from 0 for genetically similar populations to 1 for divergent populations. We generalize results obtained for population pairs to arbitrarily many populations, characterizing the mathematical relationship between FST, the frequency M of the more frequent allele at a polymorphic biallelic marker, and the number of subpopulations K. We show that for fixed K, FST has a peculiar constraint as a function of M, with a maximum of 1 only if M = i/K for integers i with {lceil}K/2{rciel} [&le;] i [&le;] K - 1. For fixed M, as K grows large, the range of FST becomes the full closed or half-open unit interval. For fixed K, however, some M < (K - 1)/K always exists at which the upper bound on FST is constrained to be below [Formula]. In each of three migration models--island, rectangular stepping-stone, and linear stepping-stone--we use coalescent simulations to show that under weak migration, FST depends strongly on the allele frequency M when K is small, but not when K is large. Finally, using data on human genetic variation, we employ our results to explain the generally smaller FST values between pairs of continents relative to global FST values. We discuss implications for the interpretation and use of FST.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of herbivorous insects is often considered a function of host plant diversity. However, recent research has uncovered many examples of closely related herbivores using the same host plant(s), suggesting that partitioning of host plants is not the only mechanism generating diversity. Herbivores sharing hosts may utilize different parts of the same plant, but such resource partitioning is often not apparent; hence, the factors that allow closely related herbivores to coexist are still largely undetermined. We examined whether partitioning of phenology or natural enemies may explain the coexistence of leaf cone moths (Caloptilia; Gracillariidae) associated with maples (Acer; Sapindaceae). Larval activity of 10 sympatric Caloptilia species found on nine maple species was monitored every 2-3 weeks for a total of 13 sampling events, and an exhaustive search for internal parasitoid wasps was conducted using high-throughput sequencing. Blocking primers were used to facilitate the detection of wasp larvae inside moth tissue. We found considerable phenological overlap among Caloptilia species, with two clear peaks in July and September-October. Coexisting Caloptilia species also had largely overlapping parasitoid communities; a total of 13 wasp species belonging to four families attacked Caloptilia in a non-specific fashion at an overall parasitism rate of 46.4%. Although coexistence may be facilitated by factors not accounted for in this study, it appears that niche partitioning is not necessary for closely related herbivores to stably coexist on shared hosts. Co-occurrence without resource partitioning may provide an additional axis along which herbivorous insects attain increased species richness.",

Our first attempt at directly clustering the values failed, most likely due to the so-called \\\"curse of dimensionality\\\". The clusters were not reproducible, and the outputs differed with different methods. By utilizing rigid geometry with a prime ideal I-adic (p-adic) metric, however, we rearranged the sample clusters into a meaningful and reproducible order, and the results were the same with each of the different clustering methods tested. Furthermore, we have also succeeded in application of this method to expression array data in similar situations. Thus, we eliminated the \\\"curse of dimensionality\\\" from the data set, at least in clustering methods. It is possible that our approach determines a characteristic value of systems that follow a Boltzmann distribution.",

    "abstract": "Complex learned behaviors must involve the integrated action of distributed brain circuits. While the contributions of individual regions to learning have been extensively investigated, understanding how distributed brain networks orchestrate their activity over the course of learning remains elusive. To address this gap, we used fMRI combined with tools from dynamic network neuroscience to obtain time-resolved descriptions of network coordination during reinforcement learning. We found that learning to associate visual cues with reward involves dynamic changes in network coupling between the striatum and distributed brain regions, including visual, orbitofrontal, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, we found that flexibility in striatal network dynamics correlates with participants learning rate and inverse temperature, two parameters derived from reinforcement learning models. Finally, we found that not all forms of learning relate to this circuit: episodic memory, measured in the same participants at the same time, was related to dynamic connectivity in distinct brain networks. These results suggest that dynamic changes in striatal-centered networks provide a mechanism for information integration during reinforcement learning.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLearning from the outcomes of actions-referred to as reinforcement learning-is an essential part of life. The roles of individual brain regions in reinforcement learning have been well characterized in terms of the updating of values for actions or sensory stimuli. Missing from this account, however, is a description of the manner in which different brain areas interact during learning to integrate sensory and value information.

    "abstract": "We develop and analyze a reaction-diffusion model to investigate the dynamics of the lifespan of a bystander signal emitted when cells are exposed to radiation. Experimental studies by Mothersill and Seymour 1997, using malignant epithelial cell lines, found that an emitted bystander signal can still cause bystander effects in cells even 60h after its emission. Several other experiments have also shown that the signal can persist for months and even years. Also, bystander effects have been hypothesized as one of the factors responsible for the phenomenon of low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity and increased radioresistance (HRS/IRR). Here, we confirm this hypothesis with a mathematical model, which we fit to Joiners data on HRS/IRR in a T98G glioma cell line. Furthermore, we use phase plane analysis to understand the full dynamics of the signals lifespan. We find that both single and multiple radiation exposure can lead to bystander signals that either persist temporarily or permanently. We also found that, in an heterogeneous environment, the size of the domain exposed to radiation and the number of radiation exposures can determine whether a signal will persist temporarily or permanently. Finally, we use sensitivity analysis to identify those cell parameters that affect the signals lifespan and the signal-induced cell death the most.",

Interpreting our data within the context of recent ancient human genomic evidence, which suggests an increase in human mobility during the LNBA, we propose a possible scenario for the spread of Y. pestis during the LNBA: Y. pestis may have entered Europe from Central Eurasia during an expansion of steppe people, persisted within Europe until the mid Bronze Age, and moved back towards Central Eurasia in parallel with subsequent human population movements.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional organization of chromosomes is tightly related to their biological function 1. Both imaging and chromosome conformation capture studies have revealed several layers of organization 2-4: segregation into active and inactive compartments at the megabase scale 5, and partitioning into domains (TADs) 6,7 and associated loops 8 at the sub-megabase scale. Yet, it remains unclear how these layers of genome organization form, interact with one another, and contribute to or result from genome activities. TADs seem to have critical roles in regulating gene expression by promoting or preventing interactions between promoters and distant cis-acting regulatory elements 9-14, and different architectural proteins, including cohesin, have been proposed to play central roles in their formation 15,16. However, experimental depletions of these proteins have resulted in marginal changes in chromosome organization 17-19. Here, we show that deletion of the cohesin-loading factor, Nipbl, leads to loss of chromosome-associated cohesin and results in dramatic genome reorganization. TADs and associated loops vanish globally, even in the absence of transcriptional changes. In contrast, segregation into compartments is preserved and even reinforced. Strikingly, the disappearance of TADs unmasks a finer compartment structure that accurately reflects the underlying epigenetic landscape. These observations demonstrate that the 3D organization of the genome results from the independent action of two distinct mechanisms: 1) cohesin-independent segregation of the genome into fine-scale compartment regions, defined by the underlying chromatin state; and 2) cohes-dependent formation of TADs possibly by the recently proposed loop extrusion mechanism 20,21, enabling long-range and target-specific activity of promiscuous enhancers. The interplay between these mechanisms creates an architecture that is more complex than a simple hierarchy of layers and can be central to guiding normal development.",

    "abstract": "Our overall goal is to develop machine learning approaches based on genomics and other relevant accessible information for use in predicting how a patient will respond to a given proposed drug or treatment. Given the complexity of this problem, we begin by developing, testing, and analyzing learning methods using data from simulated systems, which allows us access to a known ground truth. We examine the benefits of using prior system knowledge and investigate how learning accuracy depends on various system parameters as well as the amount of training data available. The simulations are based on Boolean networks - directed graphs with 0/1 node states and logical node update rules - which are the simplest computational systems that can mimic the dynamic behavior of cellular systems. Boolean networks can be generated and simulated at scale, have complex yet cyclical dynamics, and as such provide a useful framework for developing machine learning algorithms for modular and hierarchical networks such as biological systems in general and cancer in particular. We demonstrate that utilizing prior knowledge (in the form of network connectivity information), without detailed state equations, greatly increases the power of machine learning algorithms to predict network steady state node values (\\\"phenotypes\\\") and perturbation responses (\\\"drug effects\\\").",

Although F. nucleatum abundance is increased in inflammatory bowel disease subjects and is prevalent in colorectal cancer patients, the causal role of the bacterium in gastrointestinal disorders and the mechanistic details of host cell functions subversion are not fully understood.\\n\\nWe devised a computational strategy to identify putative secreted F. nucleatum proteins (FusoSecretome) and to infer their interactions with human proteins based on the presence of host molecular mimicry elements. FusoSecretome proteins share similar features with known bacterial virulence factors thereby highlighting their pathogenic potential. We show that they interact with human proteins that participate in infection-related cellular processes and localize in established cellular districts of the host-pathogen interface. Our network-based analysis identified 31 functional modules in the human interactome preferentially targeted by 138 FusoSecretome proteins, among which we selected 26 as main candidate virulence proteins, representing both putative and known virulence proteins. Finally, 6 of the preferentially targeted functional modules are implicated in the onset and progression of inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer.\\n\\nOverall, our computational analysis identified candidate virulence proteins potentially involved in the F. nucleatum - human cross-talk in the context of gastrointestinal diseases.",

    "abstract": "Population genetic methods are widely used to retrace the introduction routes of invasive species. The unsupervised Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in STRUCTURE is amongst the most frequently use of these methods, but its ability to provide reliable information about introduction routes has never before been assessed. We used computer simulations of microsatellite datasets to evaluate the extent to which the clustering results provided by STRUCTURE were misleading for the inference of introduction routes for two invasive populations independently introduced from a native population. For this simple scenario of independent introductions, the assumption of two clusters (i.e. K=2) would not be expected to result in STRUCTURE assigning the native population to one cluster, with both invasive populations assigned to the second cluster. We investigated the influence of two demographic parameters (effective size and bottleneck severity) and different numbers of loci on the type and frequency of misleading results. We showed that misleading STRUCTURE results were obtained for 10% of our simulated datasets and at a frequency of up to 37% for some combinations of parameters. Our results highlighted two different categories of misleading output. The first occurs in situations in which the native population has a low level of diversity. In this case, the two introduced populations may be very similar, despite their independent introduction histories. The second category results from convergence issues in STRUCTURE for K=2, with strong bottleneck severity and/or large numbers of loci resulting in high levels of differentiation between the three populations.",

    "abstract": "We present a new algorithm to cluster high dimensional sequence data, and its application to the field of metagenomics, which aims to reconstruct individual genomes from a mixture of genomes sampled from an environ-mental site, without any prior knowledge of reference data (genomes) or the shape of clusters. Such problems typically cannot be solved directly with classical approaches seeking to estimate the density of clusters, e.g., using the shared nearest neighbors rule, due to the prohibitive size of contemporary sequence datasets. We explore here a new method based on combining the shared nearest neighbor (SNN) rule with the concept of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). The proposed method, called LSH-SNN, works by randomly splitting the input data into smaller-sized subsets (buckets) and, employing the shared nearest neighbor rule on each of these buckets. Links can be created among neighbors sharing a sufficient number of elements, hence allowing clusters to be grown from linked elements. LSH-SNN can scale up to larger datasets consisting of millions of sequences, while achieving high accuracy across a variety of sample sizes and complexities.",

    "abstract": "In Arabidopsis, development during flowering is coordinated by transport of the hormone auxin mediated by polar-localized PIN-FORMED1 (AtPIN1). However Arabidopsis has lost a PIN clade sister to AtPIN1, Sister-of-PIN1 (SoPIN1), which is conserved in flowering plants. We previously proposed that the AtPIN1 organ initiation and vein patterning functions are split between the SoPIN1 and PIN1 clades in grasses. Here we show that in the grass Brachypodium sopin1 mutants have organ initiation defects similar to Arabidopsis atpin1, while loss of PIN1 function in Brachypodium has little effect on organ initiation but alters stem growth. Heterologous expression of Brachypodium SoPIN1 and PIN1b in Arabidopsis provides further evidence of functional specificity. SoPIN1 but not PIN1b can mediate flower formation in null atpin1 mutants, although both can complement a missense allele. The behavior of SoPIN1 and PIN1b in Arabidopsis illustrates how membrane and tissue-level accumulation, transport activity, and interaction contribute to PIN functional specificity.",

    "abstract": "The quantification of tropical tree biodiversity worldwide remains an open and challenging problem. In fact, more than two-fifths of the global tree population can be found either in tropical or sub-tropical forests1, but species identities are known only for {approx} 0.000067% of the individuals in all tropical forests2. For practical reasons, biodiversity is typically measured or monitored at fine spatial scales. However, important drivers of ecological change tend to act at large scales. Conservation issues, for example, apply to diversity at global, national or regional scales. Extrapolating species richness from the local to the global scale is not straightforward. Indeed, a vast number of different biodiversity estimators have been developed under different statistical sampling frameworks3-7, but most of them have been designed for local/regional-scale extrapolations, and they tend to be sensitive to the spatial distribution of trees8, sample coverage and sampling methods9. Here, we introduce an analytical framework that provides robust and accurate estimates of species richness and abundances in biodiversity-rich ecosystems, as confirmed by tests performed on various in silico-generated forests. The new framework quantifies the minimum percentage cover that should be sampled to achieve a given average confidence in the upscaled estimate of biodiversity. Our analysis of 15 empirical forest plots shows that previous methods10,11 have systematically overestimated the total number of species and leads to new estimates of hyper-rarity10 at the global scale11, known as Fishers paradox2. We show that hyper-rarity is a signature of critical-like behavior12 in tropical forests13-15, and it provides a buffer against mass extinctions16. When biotic factors or environmental conditions change, some of these rare species are more able than others to maintain the ecosystems functions, thus underscoring the importance of rare species.",
