    "abstract": "T cell signaling initiates upon binding of peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) on an antigen-presenting cell (APC) to the T cell receptor (TCR) on a T cell. TCR phosphorylation in response to pMHC binding is accompanied by segregation of the transmembrane phosphatase CD45 away from TCR-pMHC complexes. The kinetic segregation hypothesis proposes that CD45 exclusion shifts the local kinase-phosphatase balance to favor TCR phosphorylation. Spatial partitioning may arise from the size difference between the large CD45 extracellular domain and the smaller TCR-pMHC complex, although parsing potential contributions of extracellular protein size, actin activity, and lipid domains is difficult in living cells. Here, we reconstitute segregation of CD45 from bound receptor-ligand pairs using purified proteins on model membranes. Using a model receptor-ligand pair (FRB-FKBP), we first test physical and computational predictions for protein organization at membrane interfaces. We then show that the TCR-pMHC interaction causes partial exclusion of CD45. Comparing two developmentally-regulated isoforms of CD45, the larger RABC variant is excluded more rapidly and efficiently (~50%) than the smaller R0 isoform (~20%), suggesting that CD45 isotypes could regulate signaling thresholds in different T cell subtypes. Similar to the sensitivity of T cell signaling, TCR-pMHC interactions with Kds of [&le;]15 M were needed to exclude CD45. We further show that the co-receptor PD-1 with its ligand PD-L1, immunotherapy targets that inhibit T cell signaling, also exclude CD45. These results demonstrate that the binding energies of physiological receptor-ligand pairs on the T cell are sufficient to create spatial organization at membrane-membrane interfaces.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe interface between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell (APC) results in the formation of biochemically distinct plasma membrane domains that initiate signaling cascades. Here, using biochemical reconstitution and microscopy, we show that the binding energies of the TCRpMHC and PD-1-PD-L1 complexes are sufficient to create spatial organization at a model membrane-membrane interface. We show that spatial organization depends upon receptor-ligand binding affinity and the relative sizes of the extracellular domains. These biophysical parameters may be used to fine-tune signaling cascades in T cells.",

Specifically, to obtain a relative complexity measure we compare the Lempel-Ziv complexity of the actual centroid sequence to the one of Markov processes sharing the same transition probabilities between centroids; as an illustration, we show that the dependence of such relative complexity on the characteristic time scale of spike-frequency adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Cell-cell fusion is inherent to any form of sexual reproduction. Loss of HAPLESS 2/GENERATIVE CELL SPECIFIC 1 (HAP2/GCS1) proteins results in gamete fusion failure in different organisms but their exact role is unclear. Here we show that Arabidopsis HAP2/GCS1 expression in mammalian cells is sufficient to promote cell-cell fusion. Hemifusion and complete fusion depend on HAP2/GCS1 presence in both fusing cells. Furthermore, expression of HAP2 on the surface of pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus and on the target cells results in HAP2-dependent virus-cell fusion. This bilateral requirement can be bypassed by replacing the plant gene with C. elegans EFF-1 somatic cell fusogen in one of the fusing cells or the virus, indicating that HAP2/GCS1 and EFF-1 share a similar fusion mechanism. Structural modeling of the HAP2/GCS1 protein family predicts that they are homologous to EFF-1 and class II fusion proteins from enveloped viruses (e.g. dengue and Zika viruses). We name this superfamily FUSEXINS: FUSion proteins essential for sexual reproduction and EXoplasmic merger of plasma membranes. Thus, Fusexins unify the origin and evolution of sexual reproduction, enveloped virus entry into cells and somatic cell fusion.",

    "abstract": "Joint genetic models for multiple traits have helped to enhance association analyses. Most existing multi-trait models have been designed to increase power for detecting associations, whereas the analysis of interactions has received considerably less attention. Here, we propose iSet, a method based on linear mixed models to test for interactions between sets of variants and environmental states or other contexts. Our model generalizes previous interaction tests and in particular provides a test for local differences in the genetic architecture between contexts. We first use simulations to validate iSet before applying the model to the analysis of genotype-environment interactions in an eQTL study. Our model retrieves a larger number of interactions than alternative methods and reveals that up to 20% of cases show context-specific configurations of causal variants. Finally, we apply iSet to test for sub-group specific genetic effects in human lipid levels in a large human cohort, where we identify a gene-sex interaction for C-reactive protein that is missed by alternative methods.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGenetic effects on phenotypes can depend on external contexts, including environment. Statistical tests for identifying such interactions are important to understand how individual genetic variants may act in different contexts. Interaction effects can either be studied using measurements of a given phenotype in different contexts, under the same genetic backgrounds, or by stratifying a population into subgroups. Here, we derive a method based on linear mixed models that can be applied to both of these designs. iSet enables testing for interactions between context and sets of variants, and accounts for polygenic effects. We validate our model using simulations, before applying it to the genetic analysis of gene expression studies and genome-wide association studies of human blood lipid levels. We find that modeling interactions with variant sets offers increased power, thereby uncovering interactions that cannot be detected by alternative methods.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionMathematical models of HIV transmission that incorporate the dynamics of disease progression can estimate the potential impact of adjunctive strategies to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV treatment and prevention. Suppressive treatment of HIV-positive persons co-infected with herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) with valacyclovir, a medication directed against HSV-2, can lower HIV viral load, but the impact of valacyclovir on population HIV transmission has not been estimated.\\n\\nMethodsWe applied data on CD4 and viral load progression in ART-naive persons studied in two HIV clinical trials to a novel, discrete-time Markov model. We validated our disease progression estimates using data from a trial of home-based HIV counseling and testing in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Finally, we applied our disease progression estimates to a dynamic transmission model estimating the impact of providing valacyclovir to ART-naive individuals to reduce onward transmission of HIV in three scenarios of different ART and valacyclovir population coverage. We assumed that valacyclovir reduced HIV viral load by 1.23 log copies/L, and that persons treated with valacyclovir initiated ART more rapidly when their CD4 fell below 500 due to improved retention in pre-ART care.\\n\\nResultsThe average duration of HIV infection following acute infection was 9.5 years. The duration of disease after acute infection and before reaching CD4 200 cells/L was 2.53 years longer for females than males. Relative to a baseline of community HIV testing and counseling and ART initiation at CD4 <=500 cells/L, valacyclovir with increased linkage to care resulted in 166,000 fewer HIV infections over ten years, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $4,696 per HIV infection averted. The Test and Treat scenario with 70% ART coverage and no valacyclovir resulted in 202,000 fewer HIV infections at an ICER of $6,579.\\n\\nConclusionEven when compared with initiation of valacyclovir, a safe drug that reduces HIV viral load, universal treatment for HIV is the optimal strategy for averting new infections and increasing public health benefit. Universal HIV treatment should be pursued by all countries to most effectively and efficiently reduce the HIV burden.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWith a global target set for zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030 and some regional programmes close to eliminating canine rabies, there is an urgent need for enhanced surveillance strategies suitable for declaring freedom from disease and elimination of transmission with known confidence.\\n\\nMethodsUsing exhaustive contact tracing across settings in Tanzania we generated detailed data on rabies incidence, rabid dog biting behaviour and health-seeking behaviour of bite victims. Using these data we compared case detection of sampling-based and enhanced surveillance methodologies and investigated elimination verification procedures.\\n\\nFindingsWe demonstrate that patients presenting to clinics with bite injuries are sensitive sentinels for identifying dog rabies cases. Triage of patients based on bite history criteria and investigation of suspicious incidents can confirm >10% of dog rabies cases and is an affordable approach that will enable validation of disease freedom following two years without case detection. Approaches based on sampling the dog population without using bite-injury follow-up were found to be neither sensitive nor cost-effective.\\n\\nInterpretationThe low prevalence of rabies, and short window in which disease can be detected, preclude sampling-based surveillance. Instead, active case finding guided by bite-patient triage is needed as elimination is approached. Our proposed methodology is affordable, practical and supports the goal of eliminating human rabies deaths by improving administration of lifesaving post-exposure prophylaxis for genuinely exposed but untreated contacts. Moreover, joint investigations by public health and veterinary workers will strengthen intersectoral partnerships and capacity for control of emerging zoonoses.",
