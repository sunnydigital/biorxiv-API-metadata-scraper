    "abstract": "1MotivationThe advent of inexpensive high-throughput sequencing (HTS) places new demands on motif discovery algorithms. To confront the challenges and embrace the opportunities presented by the growing wealth of information tied up in HTS datasets, we developed K-mer motif multinomial mixtures (KMMMs), a flexible class of Bayesian models for identifying multiple motifs in sequence sets using K-mer tables. Advantages of this framework are inference with time and space complexities that only scale with K, and the ability to be incorporated into larger Bayesian models.\\n\\nResultsWe derived a class of probabilistic models of K-mer tables generated from sequence containing multiple motifs. KMMMs model the K-mer table as a multinomial mixture, with motif and background components, which are distributions over K-mers overlapping with each of the latent motifs and over K-mers that do not overlap with any motif, respectively. The framework casts motif discovery as a posterior inference problem, and we present several approximate inference methods that provide accurate reconstructions of motifs in synthetic data. Finally we apply the method to discover motifs in DNAse hypersensitive sites and ChIP-seq peaks obtained from the ENCODE project.",

    "abstract": "Bioinformatics methods typically use textual representations of genetic information, represented computationally as strings or sub-strings of the characters A, T, G and C. Image processing methods offer a rich source of alternative descriptors as they are designed to work in the presence of noisy data without the need for exact matching. We introduce a method, multi-resolution local binary patterns (MLBP) from image processing to extract local  texture changes from nucleotide sequence data. We apply this feature space to the alignment-free binning of metagenomic data. The effectiveness of MLBP is demonstrated using both simulated and real human gut microbial communities. The intuition behind our method is the MLBP feature vectors permit sequence comparisons without the need for explicit pairwise matching. Sequence reads or contigs can then be represented as vectors and their  texture compared efficiently using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to perform dimensionality reduction to capture eigengenome information and perform clustering (here using RSVD and BH-tSNE). We demonstrate this approach outperforms existing methods based on k-mer frequency. The image processing method, MLBP, thus offers a viable alternative feature space to textual representations of sequence data.

    "abstract": "The origin of life may have been a low probability event that involved both RNA and polypeptides. While such an event would occur with low probability, the probability is not too low in the context of the number of nucleation opportunities on the primitive Earth. The probability for the nucleation event is too small if needed components occur as frequently as disruptive components do, without specific interactions between the two classes. However, if many of the needed components contribute by inhibiting otherwise disruptive components, a high probability for a complex nucleation as the beginning of life event emerges. RNA interference and long non-coding RNAs are ascribed roles in inhibiting components that would otherwise be disruptive in the context of a nucleation event. The theory likewise provides an inhibitory role for the large fraction of proteins (35% to 40%) that have no known function in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It is suggested that volcanic ash could provide the large number of random shapes needed as the basis for the nucleation event. Experiments based on that hypothesis are proposed.",

    "abstract": "Annotating genes with information describing their role in the cell is a fundamental goal in biology, and essential for interpreting data-rich assays such as microarray analysis and RNA-Seq. Gene annotation takes many forms, from Gene Ontology (GO) terms, to tissues or cell types of significant expression, to putative regulatory factors and DNA sequences. Almost invariably in gene databases, annotations are connected to genes by a Boolean relationship, e.g., a GO term either is or isnt associated with a particular gene. While useful for many purposes, Boolean-type annotations fail to capture the varying degrees by which some annotations describe their associated genes and give no indication of the relevance of annotations to cellular logistical activities such as gene expression. We hypothesized that weighted annotations could prove useful for understanding gene function and for interpreting gene expression data, and developed a method to generate these from Boolean annotations and a large compendium of gene expression data. The method uses an independent component analysis-based approach to find gene modules in the compendium, and then assigns gene-specific weights to annotations proportional to the degree to which they are shared among members of the module, with the reasoning that the more an annotation is shared by genes in a module, the more likely it is to be relevant to their function and, therefore, the higher it should be weighted. In this paper, we show that analysis of expression data with module-weighted annotations appears to be more resistant to the confounding effect of gene-gene correlations than non-weighted annotation enrichment analysis, and show several examples in which module-weighted annotations provide biological insights not revealed by Boolean annotations. We also show that application of the method to a simple form of genetic regulatory annotation, namely, the presence or absence of putative regulatory words (oligonucleotides) in gene promoters, leads to module-weighted words that closely match known regulatory sequences, and that these can be used to quickly determine key regulatory sequences in differential expression data.",

    "abstract": "The Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) is indispensable for cyanobacterial photoprotection by quenching phycobilisome fluorescence upon photoconversion from the orange OCPO to the red OCPR form. Cyanobacterial genomes frequently harbor, besides genes for Orange Carotenoid Proteins (OCPs), several genes encoding homologs of OCPs N- or C-terminal domains (NTD, CTD). Unlike the well-studied NTD homologs, called Red Carotenoid Proteins (RCPs), the role of CTD homologs remains elusive. We show how OCP can be reassembled from its functional domains. Expression of Synechocystis OCP-CTD in carotenoid-producing Escherichia coli yielded violet-colored proteins, which, upon mixing with the RCP-apoprotein, produced an orange-like photoswitchable form that further photoconverted into a species spectroscopically indistinguishable from RCP, thus demonstrating a unique carotenoid shuttle mechanism. The CTD itself is a novel, dimeric carotenoid-binding protein, which effectively quenches singlet oxygen and interacts with the Fluorescence Recovery Protein, assigning physiological roles to CTD homologs and explaining the evolutionary process of OCP formation.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe C-domain of cyanobacterial OCP dimerizes, binds a carotenoid, and delivers it to the N-domain forming photoactive OCP.",

Now, with our knowledge of whole genome sequences, repetitive sequences can be used to identify polymorphisms that can be mapped and scored in a systematic manner. We have developed a simple, robust platform for designing primers, PCR amplification, and high throughput cloning that allows hundreds to thousands of markers to be scored for less than $5 per sample. Conserved regions were used to design PCR primers for amplifying thousands of middle repetitive regions of the maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) genome. Bioinformatic scans were then used to identify DNA sequence polymorphisms in the low copy intervening sequences. When used in conjunction with simple DNA preps, optimized PCR conditions, high multiplex Illumina indexing and a bioinformatic marker calling platform tailored for repetitive sequences, this methodology provides a cost effective genotyping strategy for large-scale genomic selection projects. We show detailed results from four maize primer sets that produced between 1,335-3,225 good coverage loci with 1056 that segregated appropriately in a bi-parental family. This approach could have wide applicability to breeding and conservation biology, where hundreds of thousands of samples need to be genotyped for very minimal cost.",

Such models provide information about the likely outcomes that will follow each selected action, and their use is a key function underlying complex adaptive behavior. However, the neural mechanisms supporting this ability remain poorly understood. In the present work, we adapt for rodents recent advances from work on human planning, presenting for the first time a task for animals which produces many trials of planned behavior per session, allowing the experimental toolkit available for use in trial-by-trial tasks for rodents to be applied to the study of planning. We take advantage of one part of this toolkit to address a perennially controversial issue in planning research: the role of the dorsal hippocampus. Although prospective representations in the hippocampus have been proposed to support model-based planning, intact planning in hippocampally damaged animals has been observed in a number of assays. Combining formal algorithmic behavioral analysis with muscimol inactivation, we provide the first causal evidence directly linking dorsal hippocampus with planning behavior. The results reported, and the methods introduced, open the door to new and more detailed investigations of the neural mechanisms of planning, in the hippocampus and throughout the brain.",

These new methods improve on existing methods by allowing for arbitrary correlations in effect sizes among conditions. This flexible approach increases power, improves effect estimates, and allows for more quantitative assessments of effect-size heterogeneity compared to simple \"shared/condition-specific\" assessments. We illustrate these features through an analysis of locally-acting variants associated with gene expression (\"cis eQTLs\") in 44 human tissues. Our analysis identifies more eQTLs than existing approaches, consistent with improved power. We show that while genetic effects on expression are extensively shared among tissues, effect sizes can still vary greatly among tissues. Some shared eQTLs show stronger effects in subsets of biologically related tissues (e.g., brain-related tissues), or in only one tissue (e.g., testis). Our methods are widely applicable, computationally tractable for many conditions, and available online.",

Temporal network theory is an extension of network theory that has been successfully applied to the modeling of dynamic processes in economics, social sciences and engineering. The objective of this paper is twofold: (i) to present a detailed description of the central tenets and outline measures from temporal network theory; (ii) apply these measures to a resting-state fMRI dataset to illustrate their utility. Further, we discuss the interpretation of temporal network theory in the context of the dynamic functional brain connectome.

    "abstract": "Recognition and rejection of heterospecific male gametes occurs in a broad range of taxa, although the complexity and redundancy of mechanisms underlying this postmating cryptic female choice is poorly understood. In plants, the arena for these interactions is the female reproductive tract (pistil), within which heterospecific pollen tube growth can be arrested via active molecular recognition. Unilateral incompatibility (UI) is one such pistil-mediated barrier in which pollen rejection occurs in only one direction of an interspecific cross. We investigated the genetic basis of pistil-side UI between Solanum species, with the specific goal of understanding the role and magnitude of epistasis between UI QTL. Using heterospecific introgression lines (ILs) between Solanum pennellii and S. lycopersicum, we assessed the individual and pairwise effects of three chromosomal regions (ui1.1, ui3.1, and ui12.1) previously associated with interspecific UI among Solanum species. Specifically, we pyramided ui12.1 with each of ui1.1 and ui3.1, and assessed the strength of UI pollen rejection in pyramided (double introgression) lines, compared to single introgression genotypes. We found that none of the three QTL individually showed UI rejection phenotypes, but lines combining ui3.1 and ui12.1 showed significant pistil-side pollen rejection. Furthermore, double introgression lines that combined different chromosomal regions overlapping ui3.1 differed significantly in their rate of UI, consistent with at least two genetic factors on chromosome three contributing quantitatively to interspecific pollen rejection. Together, our data indicate that loci on both chromosomes 3 and 12 are jointly required for the expression of UI between S. pennellii and S. lycopersicum suggesting that coordinated molecular interactions among a relatively few loci underlying the expression of this postmating prezygotic barrier. In addition, in conjunction with previous data, at least one of these loci appears to also contribute to conspecific self-incompatibility, consistent with a partially shared genetic basis between inter- and intraspecific mechanisms of postmating prezygotic female choice.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) can be developed by computational approaches that infer regulator-target gene interactions from transcriptional assays. Successful algorithms that generate predictive, accurate TRNs enable the identification of regulator-target relationships in conditions where experimentally determining regulatory interactions is a challenge. Improving the ability of TRNs to successfully predict known regulator-target relationships in model species will enhance confidence in applying these approaches to determine regulator-target interactions in non-model species where experimental validation is challenging. Many transcriptional profiling experiments are performed across multiple time points; therefore we sought to improve regulator-target predictions by adjusting how time is incorporated into the network. We created ExRANGES, which incorporates Expression in a Rate-Normalized GEne Specific manner that adjusts how expression data is provided to the network algorithm. We tested this on a two different network construction approaches and found that ExRANGES prioritizes targets differently than traditional expression and improves the ability of these networks to accurately predict known regulator targets. ExRANGES improved the ability to correctly identify targets of transcription factors in large data sets in four different model systems: mouse, human, Arabidopsis, and yeast. Finally, we examined the performance of ExRANGES on a small data set from field-grown Oryza sativa and found that it also improved the ability to identify known targets even with a limited data set.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTo understand how organisms can turn a collection of genes into a physiological response, we need to understand how certain genes are turned on and off. In model organisms, the ability to identify direct targets of transcription factors via ChIP-Seq in a high-throughput manner has advanced our understanding of transcriptional regulatory networks and how organisms regulate gene expression. However, for non-model organisms, it remains a challenge to identify TF-target relationships through experimental approaches such as ChIP-Seq. Without this information, the ability to understand regulatory control is limited. Computational approaches to identify regulator-target relationships in silico from easily attainable transcriptional data offer a solution. Several approaches exist for identifying gene regulatory networks, including many that take advantage of time series data. Most of these approaches weigh the relationship between regulators and putative targets at all time points equally. However, many regulators may control a single target in response to different inputs. In our approach, we focus on the association between regulators and targets primarily at times when there is a significant change in expression. ExRANGES essentially weights the expression value of each time point by the slope change after that time point so that relationships between regulators and targets are emphasized at the time points when the transcript levels are changing. This change in input into network identification algorithms improves the ability to predict regulator-target interactions and could be applied to many different algorithms We hope this improvement will increase the ability to identify regulators of interest in non-model species.",

    "abstract": "Heart Rate (HR) is a fundamental vital sign, monitoring which provides essential information for automated healthcare systems. The emerging technology of Photoplethysmograph (PPG) is shown as a feasible candidate for such applications; however, Motion Artifacts (MA) hinder efficient HR estimation using PPG, especially in situations involving physical activities. It is previously shown that even in the presence of sever MA, HR is still traceable with the help of simultaneous acceleration data although at high computational expenses. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, that not only improves the accuracy in HR estimation, but also achieves realtime performance by significantly reducing the complexity of system; mainly due to alleviation of the need for computationally demanding MA cancellation methods. Utilizing an spectrum estimation model (autoregressive) that suits well to the inherent PPG generation process, and benefiting from further intrinsic properties of the environment (e.g., the venous pulsation phenomenon); our framework achieves realtime and delayed (post-processed) Average Absolute Errors (AAE) of 1.19 and 0.99 Beats Per Minute (BPM) respectively, on the 12 benchmark recordings in which subjects run at speeds of up to 15 km/h maximum. Moreover, the system makes standalone implementation feasible by processing input frames (2 channel PPG and 3D ACC) in < 0.004 times of the frame duration, operating on a 3.2 GHz processor.

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional architecture of DNA within the nucleus is a key determinant of interactions between genes, regulatory elements, and transcriptional machinery. As a result, differences in loop structure are associated with differences in gene expression and cell state. Here, we introduce diffloop, an R/Bioconductor package for identifying differential DNA looping between samples. The package additionally provides a suite of functions for the quality control, statistical testing, annotation and visualization of DNA loops. We demonstrate this functionality by detecting differences in DNA loops between ENCODE ChIA-PET datasets and relate looping to differences in epigenetic state and gene expression.",
