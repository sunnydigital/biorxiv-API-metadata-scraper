    "abstract": "Some microbes can transition from an environmental lifestyle to a pathogenic one1-3. This ecological switch typically occurs through the acquisition of horizontally acquired virulence genes4,5. However, the genomic features that must be present in a population prior to the acquisition of virulence genes and emergence of pathogenic clones remain unknown. We hypothesized that virulence adaptive polymorphisms (VAPs) circulate in environmental populations and are required for this transition. We developed a comparative genomic framework for identifying VAPs, using Vibrio cholerae as a model. We then characterized several environmental VAP alleles to show that, while some of them reduced the ability of clinical strains to colonize a mammalian host, other alleles conferred efficient host colonization. These results show that VAPs are present in environmental bacterial populations prior to the emergence of virulent clones. We propose a scenario in which VAPs circulate in the environment, they become selected and enriched under certain ecologicalconditions, and finally a genomic background containing several VAPs acquires virulence factors that allows for its emergence as a pathogenic clone.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSmall variant calling is an important component of many analyses, and, in many instances, it is important to determine the set of variants which appear in multiple callsets. Variant matching is complicated by variants that have multiple equivalent representations. Normalization and decomposition algorithms have been proposed, but are not robust to different representation of complex variants. Variant matching is also usually done to maximize the number of matches, as opposed to other optimization criteria.\\n\\nResultsWe present the VarMatch algorithm for the variant matching problem. Our algorithm is based on a theoretical result which allows us to partition the input into smaller subproblems without sacrificing accuracy VarMatch is robust to different representation of complex variants and is particularly effective in low complexity regions or those dense in variants. VarMatch is able to detect more matches than either the normalization or decomposition algorithms on tested datasets. It also implements different optimization criteria, such as edit distance, that can improve robustness to different variant representations. Finally the VarMatch software provides summary statistics, annotations, and visualizations that are useful for understanding callers performance.\\n\\nAvailabilityVarMatch is freely available at: https://github.com/medvedevgroup/varmatch\\n\\nContactchensun@cse.psu.edu",

    "abstract": "Background: We have identified molecules that exhibit synthetic lethality in cells with loss of the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene. However, recognizing tumors that have inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor function is challenging because the loss may occur via mechanisms that do not involve mutation of the genomic locus. Degradation of the NF1 protein, independent of NF1 mutation status, photocopies inactivating mutations to drive tumors in human glioma cell lines. NF1 inactivation may alter the transcriptional landscape of a tumor and allow a machine learning classifier to detect which tumors will benefit from synthetic lethal molecules.\\n\\nResults: We developed a strategy to predict tumors with low NF1 activity and hence tumors that may respond to treatments that target cells lacking NF1. Using RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we trained an ensemble of 500 logistic regression classifiers that integrates mutation status with whole transcriptomes to predict NF1 inactivation in glioblastoma (GBM). On TCGA data, the classifier detected NF1 mutated tumors (test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) mean = 0.77, 95% quantile = 0.53 - 0.95) over 50 random initializations. On RNA-Seq data transformed into the space of gene expression microarrays, this method produced a classifier with similar performance (test set AUROC mean = 0.77, 95% quantile = 0.53 - 0.96). We applied our ensemble classifier trained on the transformed TCGA data to a microarray validation set of 12 samples with matched RNA and NF1 protein-level measurements. The classifiers NF1 score was associated with NF1 protein concentration in these samples.\\n\\nConclusions: We demonstrate that TCGA can be used to train accurate predictors of NF1 inactivation in GBM. The ensemble classifier performed well for samples with very high or very low NF1 protein concentrations but had mixed performance in samples with intermediate NF1 concentrations. Nevertheless, high-performing and validated predictors have the potential to be paired with targeted therapies and personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Driven by massively parallel sequencing and allied technologies, the scale of genetic predisposition testing is on a dramatic uptrend. While many patients are found to carry clinically actionable pathogenic sequence variants, testing also reveals enormous numbers of Unclassified Variants (UV), or Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS), most of which are rare missense substitutions. Following IARC variant classification guidelines, quantitative methods have been developed to integrate multiple data types for clinical UV evaluation in BRCA1/2; results from these analyses are recorded in the BRCA gene Ex-UV database (hci-exlovd.hci.utah.edu). In variant classification, the rate-limiting step is often accumulation of patient observational data. Recently, functional assays evaluating BRCA1 RING domain and C-terminal substitutions have been calibrated, enabling variant classification through a two-component combination of sequence analysis-based predictions with functional assay results. This two-component classification was embedded in a decision tree with safeguards to avoid misclassification. For the two-component analysis, sensitivity is 87.5%, specificity is 100%, and the error rate 0.0%. Classification of a UV as likely pathogenic or likely neutral does not require certainty; the probabilistic definitions of the categories imply an error rate. Combining sequence analysis with functional assay data in two-component analysis added 146 BRCA1 variants to the Ex-UV database.",

The ability to detect ancient natural selection in the human genome could provide insights into the molecular basis for these human-specific traits. Here, we introduce a method for detecting ancient selective sweeps by scanning for extended genomic regions where our closest extinct relatives, Neandertals and Denisovans, fall outside of the present-day human variation. Regions that are unusually long indicate the presence of lineages that reached fixation in the human population faster than expected under neutral evolution. Using simulations we show that the method is able to detect ancient events of positive selection and that it can differentiate those from background selection. Applying our method to the 1000 Genomes dataset, we find evidence for ancient selective sweeps favoring regulatory changes and present a list of genomic regions that are predicted to underlie positively selected human specific traits.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing has yet to be widely adopted for HIV. The difficulty of accurately reconstructing the consensus sequence of a quasispecies from reads (short fragments of DNA) in the presence of rapid between- and within-host evolution may have presented a barrier. In particular, mapping (aligning) reads to a reference sequence leads to biased loss of information; this bias can distort epidemiological and evolutionary conclusions. De novo assembly avoids this bias by effectively aligning the reads to themselves, producing a set of sequences called contigs. However contigs provide only a partial summary of the reads, misassembly may result in their having an incorrect structure, and no information is available at parts of the genome where contigs could not be assembled. To address these problems we developed the tool shiver to preprocess reads for quality and contamination, then map them to a reference tailored to the sample using corrected contigs supplemented with existing reference sequences. Run with two commands per sample, it can easily be used for large heterogeneous data sets. We use shiver to reconstruct the consensus sequence and minority variant information from paired-end short-read data produced with the Illumina platform, for 65 existing publicly available samples and 50 new samples. We show the systematic superiority of mapping to shivers constructed reference over mapping the same reads to the standard reference HXB2: an average of 29 bases per sample are called differently, of which 98.5% are supported by higher coverage. We also provide a practical guide to working with imperfect contigs.",

PSSM allows the detection of more distant homologs than a general amino acid substitution matrix does. An accurate estimation of the weights of sequences in an MSA is crucially important for PSSM construction. PSI-BLAST divides a given MSA into multiple blocks, for which sequence weights are calculated. When the block width becomes very narrow, the sequence weight calculation can be difficult.\\n\\nWe demonstrate that PSI-BLAST indeed generates a significant fraction of blocks having widths less than 5, thereby degrading the PSI-BLAST performance. We revised the code of PSI-BLAST to prevent the blocks from being narrower than a given minimum block width (MBW). We designate the modified application of PSI-BLAST as PSI-BLASTexB. When MBW is 25, PSI-BLASTexB notably outperforms PSI-BLAST consistently for three independent benchmark sets. The performance boost is even more drastic when an MSA, instead of a sequence, was used as a query.\\n\\nOur results demonstrate that the generation of narrow-width blocks during the sequence weight calculation is a critically important factor that restricts the PSI-BLAST search performance. By preventing narrow blocks, PSI-BLASTexB remarkably upgrades the PSI-BLAST performance.",

Here we investigated progression from the ES cell ground state in adherent culture. We utilised down-regulation of Rex1::GFPd2 to track loss of ES cell identity. We found that cells that have newly down-regulated this reporter have acquired competence for germline induction. They can also be efficiently specified for different somatic lineages, responding more rapidly than naive cells to inductive cues. Nodal is a candidate autocrine regulator of pluripotency. Abrogation of Nodal signalling did not substantially alter kinetics of exit from the ES cell state, but accelerated subsequent adoption of neural fate at the expense of other lineages. This effect was evident if Nodal was inhibited prior to extinction of ES cell identity. We suggest that Nodal is pivotal for non-neural competence in cells departing naive pluripotency.",

It is suggested that the absence of trees above the treeline is caused by the low temperature that limits growth. Thus, we raise the hypothesis that there is a critical minimum temperature (CTmin) preventing xylogenesis at treeline. We tested this hypothesis by examining weekly xylogenesis across three and four growing seasons in two natural Smith fir (Abies georgei var. smithii) treeline sites on the south-eastern Tibetan Plateau. Despite differences in the timing of cell differentiation among years, minimum air temperature was the dominant climatic variable associated with xylem growth; the critical minimum temperature (CTmin) for the onset and end of xylogenesis occurred at 0.7{+/-}0.4 {degrees}C. A process-based-modeled chronology of tree-ring formation using this CTmin was consistent with actual tree-ring data. This extremely low CTmin permits Smith fir growing at treeline to complete annual xylem production and maturation and provides both support and a mechanism for treeline formation.",

A major constraint in breeding resistant cultivars is the lack of mapping information of resistance (R) genes and their introgression into adapted germplasm. A considerable number of R genes have been described in barley to P. striiformis f. sp. hordei, but only a few loci have been mapped. Previously, Chen and Line (1999) reported two recessive seedling resistance loci in the Ethiopian landrace HOR 1428. In this study, we map two loci that confer resistance to P. striiformis f. sp. hordei in HOR 1428, which are located on chromosomes 3H and 5H. Both loci act as additive effect QTLs, each explaining approximately 20% of the phenotypic variation. We backcrossed HOR 1428 to the cv. Manchuria and selected based on markers flanking the RpsHOR128-5H locus. Saturation of the RpsHOR1428-5H locus with markers in the region found KASP marker K_1_0292 in complete coupling with resistance to P. striiformis f. sp. hordei and was designated Rps9. Isolation of Rps9 and flanking markers will facilitate the deployment of this genetic resource into existing programs for P. striiformis f. sp. hordei resistance.",

Despite their many differences, different orders of arachnids have been often sampled together in various studies. Active nocturnal search has been long considered the most efficient method for sampling spiders and harvestmen in tropical forests. We compared the number of species and composition of spiders and harvestmen simultaneously sampled using three sampling methods: beating tray, active nocturnal search and Winkler traps at areas along the Urucu River, Coari, Amazonas. We found that a reasonable inventorying of harvestmen can be accomplished solely by nocturnal search, whereas the beating tray and Winkler approaches are redundant. For spiders, both the nocturnal and beating tray methods were complementary and are needed to provide a more complete picture of spider assemblages. An inventory based solely on nocturnal search saves 75% of the survey costs for harvestmen assemblages and 46% for spider assemblages. Based on our findings we propose that different taxonomic groups (e.g. harvestmen and spiders) should be sampled separately in tropical forests, especially for monitoring purposes, and different sets of methods should be combined for each according to their most efficient and best cost-benefit performance.",

    "abstract": "Metatranscriptomics has emerged as a tool in microbial ecology that can resolve the functional landscape of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes within a community. In this study, we extend the potential of metatranscriptomics to probe active virus infections and virus-host relationships in marine systems. Polyadenylation-selected RNA-seq data were examined from microbial communities in two productive marine environments: a brown tide bloom event dominated by Aureococcus anophagefferens in Quantuck Bay, NY, and a diatom-dominated plankton community in Narragansett Bay, RI. Active infections by diverse giant viruses (NCLDVs) of algal and non-algal hosts were found at both sites. Ongoing infections of A. anophagefferens by a known Mimiviridae (AaV) were observed during both the peak and decline of the bloom. Bloom decline was also accompanied by increased activity for viruses other than AaV, including (+) ssRNA viruses. In Narragansett Bay, increased temporal resolution revealed active NCLDVs with both  boom-and-bust as well as  steady-state infection-like ecologies. Statistical co-occurrence examinations of the dsDNA, ssRNA and dsRNA markers within the data revealed a broad spectrum of statistically strong and significant virus-host relationships that included both known as well as novel interactions. Our approach offers a method for screening the diversity and dynamics of active viral infections in natural systems and develops links between viruses and their potential hosts in situ.\\n\\nSignificanceViruses are important partners in ecosystem scale ecology, yet their study to date is primarily limited to single virus-host infection models in the laboratory or limited to \\\"potential-actions\\\" derived from metagenomics analyses. Using metatranscriptomic sequences from polyadenylated-RNA selected samples, we have simultaneously captured information regarding eukaryotic diversity and active infection by viruses with dsDNA genomes, resulting in a statistical opportunity to predict \\\"who is infecting whom\\\". This approach further provides concurrent insight regarding viruses with ssRNA and dsRNA genomes, capturing dynamics for the communities of viruses infecting single-celled eukaryotes. Given the central role of these plankton in global scale processes, our efforts result in a transformational step-forward regarding the study of in situ virus-host interactions.",

FtsZ forms dynamic filaments close to the membrane at the site of division that have recently been shown to treadmill around the division ring, guiding septal wall synthesis.\\n\\nHere, using X-ray crystallography of Staphylococcus aureus SaFtsZ we reveal how an FtsZ can adopt two functionally distinct conformations, open and closed. The open form is found in SaFtsZ filaments formed in crystals and also in soluble filaments of E. coli FtsZ as deduced by cryoEM. The closed form is found within several crystal forms of two non-polymerising SaFtsZ mutants and corresponds to many previous FtsZ structures from other organisms.\\n\\nWe argue that FtsZ undergoes a polymerisation-associated conformational switch. We show that such a switch provides explanations for both how treadmilling may occur within a single-stranded filament, and why filament assembly is cooperative.",

To significantly advance our understanding of the architecture and dynamics of the JA gene regulatory network, we performed high-resolution RNA-Seq time series analyses of methyl JA-treated Arabidopsis thaliana. Computational analysis unraveled in detail the chronology of events that occur during the early and later phases of the JA response. Several transcription factors, including ERF16 and bHLH27, were uncovered as early components of the JA gene regulatory network with a role in pathogen and insect resistance. Moreover, analysis of subnetworks surrounding the JA-induced transcription factors ORA47, RAP2.6L, and ANAC055 provided novel insights into their regulatory role of defined JA network modules. Collectively, our work illuminates the complexity of the JA gene regulatory network, pinpoints to novel regulators, and provides a valuable resource for future studies on the function of JA signaling components in plant defense and development.",

It is unclear whether PNAs occur elsewhere in the genome. To generate a comprehensive inventory of PNAs for Drosophila, we applied spectral analysis to nucleosome maps and identified thousands of PNAs throughout the genome. About half of them are not near TSS and strongly enriched for a novel sequence motif. Through genome-wide reconstitution of physiological chromatin in Drosophila embryo extracts we uncovered the molecular basis of PNA formation. We identified Phaser, an unstudied zinc finger protein that positions nucleosomes flanking the new motif. It also revealed how the global activity of the chromatin remodeler CHRAC/ACF, together with local barrier elements, generates islands of regular phasing throughout the genome. Our work demonstrates the potential of chromatin assembly by embryo extracts as a powerful tool to reconstitute chromatin features on a global scale in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Recent theory predicts that the fitness of pioneer populations can decline when species expand their range, due to high rates of genetic drift on wave fronts making selection less efficient at purging deleterious variants. To test these predictions, we studied the fate of mutator bacteria expanding their range for 1650 generations on agar plates. In agreement with theory, we find that growth abilities of strains with a high mutation rate (HMR lines) decreased significantly over time, unlike strains with a lower mutation rate (LMR lines) that present 3-4 times fewer mutations. Estimation of the distribution of fitness effect (DFE) under a spatially explicit model reveals a mean negative effect for new mutations (-0.38%), but it suggests that both advantageous and deleterious mutations have accumulated during the experiment. Furthermore, we show that the fitness of HMR lines measured in different environments has decreased relative to the ancestor strain, whereas that of LMR lines remained unchanged. Our results thus suggest that successful expanding species are affected by deleterious mutations that accumulate during the expansion process, leading to a drastic impairment of their evolutionary potential.",

Here we describe a high-performance, low-cost, open hardware pressure ejection system (Openspritzer), which can be constructed from off the shelf components. When connected to a standard micro-pipette via suitable pneumatic tubing, the device is capable of delivering minute doses of reagents to a wide range of biological and chemical systems. In this work, we characterise the performance of the device and compare it to a popular commercial system using two-photon fluorescence microscopy. We found that Openspritzer provides the same level of control over delivered reagent dose as the commercial system. Next, we demonstrate the utility of Openspritzer in a series of standard neurobiological applications. First, we used Openspritzer to deliver precise amounts of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA to hippocampal neurons to elicit time- and dose-precise excitatory and inhibitory responses, respectively. Second, we used Openspritzer to deliver infectious viral and bacterial agents to living tissue. Viral transfection of hippocampal interneurons with channelrhodopsin allowed for the optogenetic manipulation of hippocampal circuitry with light. Finally, we successfully used Openspritzer to infect organotypic hippocampal slice cultures with fluorescent Mycobacterium bovis bacilli. We anticipate that due to its high performance and low cost Openspritzer will be of interest to a broad range of researchers working in the life and physical sciences.",

In 2006, Armstrong et al. proposed a mathematical model in the form of an integro-partial differential equation. Although successful in applications, a derivation from an underlying stochastic random walk has remained elusive. In this work we develop a framework by which non-local models can be derived from a space-jump process. We show how the notions of motility and a cell polarization vector can be naturally included. With this derivation we are able to include microscopic biological properties into the model. We show that particular choices yield the original Armstrong model, while others lead to more general models, including a doubly non-local adhesion model and non-local chemotaxis models. Finally, we use random walk simulations to confirm that the corresponding continuum model represents the mean field behaviour of the stochastic random walk.",

Recent evidence indicates that constitutive antiherbivore defenses can alter natural selection on reproductive traits, but it is unclear whether induced defenses will have the same effect and whether reduced foliar damage in defended plants is the cause of this pattern. In a factorial field experiment using common milkweed, Asclepias syriaca, we induced plant defenses using jasmonic acid (JA) and imposed foliar damage using scissors. We found that JA-induced plants experienced selection for more inflorescences that were smaller in size (fewer flowers), while control plants only experienced a trend toward selection for larger inflorescences (more flowers); all effects were independent of foliar damage. Our results demonstrate that induced defenses can alter both the strength and direction of selection on reproductive traits, and suggest that antiherbivore defenses may promote the evolution of plant reproductive diversity.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary transitions between fresh and salt water happen infrequently among bacterioplankton. Within the ubiquitous and highly abundant heterotrophic Alphaproteobacteria order Pelagibacterales (SAR11), most members live in marine habitats, but the LD12 subclade has evolved as a unique freshwater lineage. LD12 cells occur as some of the most dominant freshwater bacterioplankton, yet this group has remained elusive to cultivation, hampering a more thorough understanding of its biology. Here, we report the first successful isolation of an LD12 representative, strain LSUCC0530, using high throughput dilution to extinction cultivation methods, and its complete genome sequence. Growth experiments corroborate ecological data suggesting active populations of LD12 in brackish water up to salinities of ~5. LSUCC0530 has the smallest closed genome thus far reported for a SAR11 strain (1.16 Mbp). The genome affirms many previous metabolic predictions from cultivation-independent analyses, like a complete Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas glycolysis pathway, but also provides novel insights, such as the first isocitrate dehydrogenase in LD12, a likely homologous recombination of malate synthase from outside of the SAR11 clade, and analogous substitutions of ion transporters with others that occur throughout the rest of the SAR11 clade. Growth data support metagenomic recruitment results suggesting temperature-based ecotype diversification within LD12. Key gene losses for osmolyte uptake provide a succinct hypothesis for the evolutionary transition of LD12 from salt to fresh water. For strain LSUCC0530, we propose the provisional nomenclature Candidatus Fonsibacter ubiquis.",

Cynomolgus and rhesus macaques are widely used as nonhuman primate models to study human pathogens and so considerable effort has been put into characterizing their KIR genetics.

In this study, we present a high throughput, full-length allele discovery method utilizing PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS). We also describe a new approach to Macaque Exome Sequencing (MES) and the development of the Rhexome1.0, an adapted target capture reagent that includes macaque-specific capture probesets. By using sequence reads generated by whole genome sequencing (WGS) and MES to inform primer design, we were able to increase the sensitivity of KIR allele discovery. We demonstrate this increased sensitivity by defining nine novel alleles within a cohort of Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM), a geographically isolated population with restricted KIR genetics that was thought to be completely characterized. Finally, we describe an approach to genotyping KIRs directly from sequence reads generated using WGS/MES reads. The findings presented here expand our understanding of KIR genetics in MCM by associating new genes with all eight KIR haplotypes and demonstrating the existence of at least one KIR3DS gene associated with every haplotype.",

To address this question, I tested the approach using samples from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and the previously published ground-truth mutations (GoldSet). This evaluation revealed that training models with semi-simulation does produce models that exhibit strong performance in real datasets. I found a linear relationship between the performance observed on a semi-simulated validation set and independent ground-truth in the gold set (R2 = 0.952, P < 2-16). I also found that semi-simulation can be used to pre-train models before continuing training with true labels and that this pre-training improves model performance substantially on the real dataset compared to training models only with the real dataset. The best model pre-trained with semi-simulation achieved an AUC of 0.969 [0.957-0.982] (95% confidence interval) compared to 0.911 [0.890-0.932] when training with real labels only.

    "abstract": "Copy number variants (CNVs) are an important type of genetic variation and play a causal role in many diseases. However, they are also notoriously difficult to identify accurately from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. For larger CNVs, genotyping arrays provide reasonable benchmark data, but NGS allows us to assay a far larger number of small (< 10kbp) CNVs that are poorly captured by array-based methods. The lack of high quality benchmark callsets of small-scale CNVs has limited our ability to assess and improve CNV calling algorithms for NGS data. To address this issue we developed a crowdsourcing framework, called CrowdVariant, that leverages Googles high-throughput crowdsourcing platform to create a high confidence set of copy number variants for NA24385 (NIST HG002/RM 8391), an Ashkenazim reference sample developed in partnership with the Genome In A Bottle Consortium. In a pilot study we show that crowdsourced classifications, even from non-experts, can be used to accurately assign copy number status to putative CNV calls and thereby identify a high-quality subset of these calls. We then scale our framework genome-wide to identify 1,781 high confidence CNVs, which multiple lines of evidence suggest are a substantial improvement over existing CNV callsets, and are likely to prove useful in benchmarking and improving CNV calling algorithms. Our crowdsourcing methodology may be a useful guide for other genomics applications.",

The illusion was proposed to result from superposition of two hypothetical oscillatory impulse response functions (IRF) generated in response to each flash (Bowen, 1989). In Experiment 1, we varied stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) and validated Bowen's theory: the optimal SOA for illusion to occur was correlated, across subjects, with the subject-specific IRF period. Experiment 2 revealed that pre-stimulus parietal alpha EEG phase and power, as well as post-stimulus alpha phase-locking, together determine the occurrence of the illusion on a trial-by-trial basis.

Combining genomic, biochemical and single-molecule imaging approaches, we show that although CTCF and cohesin can physically interact, CTCF binds chromatin much more dynamically than cohesin (~1 min vs. ~22 min residence time). Moreover, after unbinding, CTCF quickly rebinds another cognate site unlike cohesin (~1 min vs. ~33 min). Thus, CTCF and cohesin form a rapidly exchanging \\\"dynamic complex\\\" rather than a typical stable complex. Since CTCF and cohesin are required for loop domain formation, our results suggest that chromatin loops constantly break and reform throughout the cell cycle.",

    "abstract": "Recent genome-wide studies of both ancient and modern indigenous people of the Americas have shed light on the demographic processes involved during the first peopling. The Pacific northwest coast proves an intriguing focus for these studies due to its association with coastal migration models and genetic ancestral patterns that are difficult to reconcile with modern DNA alone. Here we report the genome-wide sequence of an ancient individual known as \\\"Shuka Kaa\\\" (\\\"Man Ahead of Us\\\") recovered from the On Your Knees Cave (OYKC) in southeastern Alaska (archaeological site 49-PET-408). The human remains date to approximately 10,300 cal years before present (BP). We also analyze low coverage genomes of three more recent individuals from the nearby coast of British Columbia dating from approximately 6075 to 1750 cal years BP. From the resulting time series of genetic data, we show that the Pacific Northwest Coast exhibits genetic continuity for at least the past 10,300 cal BP. We also infer that population structure existed in the late Pleistocene of North America with Shuka Kaa on a different ancestral line compared to other North American individuals (i.e., Anzick-1 and Kennewick Man) from the late Pleistocene or early Holocene. Despite regional shifts in mitochondrial DNA haplogroups we conclude from individuals sampled through time that people of the northern Northwest Coast belong to an early genetic lineage that may stem from a late Pleistocene coastal migration into the Americas.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe peopling of the Americas has been examined on the continental level with the aid of single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, next generation sequencing, and advancements in ancient DNA, all of which have helped elucidate major population movements. Regional paleogenomic studies, however, have received less attention and may reveal a more nuanced demographic history. Here we present genomewide sequences of individuals from the northern Northwest Coast covering a time span of ~10,000 years and show that continental patterns of demography do not necessarily apply on the regional level. In comparison with existing paleogenomic data, we demonstrate that geographically linked population samples from the Northwest Coast exhibit an early ancestral lineage and find that population structure existed among Native North American groups as early as the late Pleistocene.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) neuron subtypes modulate specific physiological functions and are involved in distinct neurological disorders. Embryonic stem cell (ESC) derived DA neurons have the potential to aid in the study of disease mechanisms, drug discovery, and possibly cell replacement therapies. DA neurons can be generated from ESCs in vitro, but the subtypes of ESC-derived DA neurons have not been investigated in detail despite the diversity of DA neurons observed in vivo. Due to cell culture heterogeneity, sampling methods applied to ESC-derived cultures can be ambiguous and potentially biased. Therefore, we developed a quantification method to capture the depth of DA neuron production in vitro by estimating the error associated with systematic random sampling. Using this method, we quantified calbindin+ and calretinin+ subtypes of DA neurons generated from mouse ESCs. We found a higher production of the calbindin+ subtype (11-27%) compared to the calretinin+ subtype (2-13%) of DA neuron; in addition, DA neurons expressing neither subtype marker were also generated. We then examined whether exogenous sonic hedgehog (SHH) and fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) affected subtype generation. Our results demonstrate that exogenous SHH and FGF8 did not alter DA neuron subtype generation in vitro. These findings suggest that a deeper understanding DA neuron derivation inclusive of mechanisms that govern the in vitro subtype specification of ESC-derived DA neurons is required.\\n\\nNoteAll research was planned and conducted while members were at Brown University\\n\\nResearch fundingNIH/NCRR/NIGMS RI Hospital COBRE Center for Stem Cell Biology (8P20GM103468-04) (MZ) Brown Institute for Brain Science Pilot Grant (4-63662) (MZ/DHK)",

    "abstract": "Gq is a heterotrimeric G protein that is widely expressed in neurons and regulates neuronal activity. To identify pathways regulating neuronal Gq signaling we performed a forward genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans for suppressors of activated Gq. One of the suppressors is an allele of sek-1, which encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) in the p38 MAPK pathway. Here we show that sek-1 mutants have a slow locomotion rate and that sek-1 acts in acetylcholine neurons to modulate both locomotion rate and Gq signaling. Furthermore, we find that sek-1 acts in mature neurons to modulate locomotion. Using genetic and behavioral approaches we demonstrate that other components of the p38 MAPK pathway also play a positive role in modulating locomotion and Gq signaling. Finally, we find that mutants in the SEK-1 p38 MAPK pathway partially suppress an activated mutant of the sodium leak channel NCA-1/NALCN, a downstream target of Gq signaling. Our results suggest that the SEK-1 p38 pathway may modulate the output of Gq signaling through NCA-1.",

    "abstract": "Landraces (traditional varieties) of crop species are a reservoir of useful genetic diversity, yet remain untapped due to the genetic linkage between the few useful alleles with hundreds of undesirable alleles1. We integrated two approaches to characterize the genetic diversity of over 3000 maize landraces from across the Americas. First, we mapped the genomic regions controlling latitudinal and altitudinal adaptation, identifying 1498 genes. Second, we developed and used F-One Association Mapping (FOAM) to directly map genes controlling flowering time across 22 environments, identifying 1,005 genes. In total 65% of the SNPs associated with altitude were also associated with flowering time. In particular, we observed many of the significant SNPs were contained in large structural variants (inversions, centromeres, and pericentromeric regions): 29.4% for flowering time, 58.4% for altitude and 13.1% for latitude. The combined mapping results indicate that while floral regulatory network genes contribute substantially to field variation, over 90% of contributing genes likely have indirect effects. Our strategy can be used to harness the diversity of maize and other plant and animal species.",
