    "abstract": "To assess the mutational robustness of nucleic acids, many genome- and protein-level studies have been performed; in these investigations, nucleic acids are treated as genetic information carriers and transferrers. However, the molecular mechanism through which mutations alter the structural, dynamic and functional properties of nucleic acids is poorly understood. Here, we performed SELEX in silico study to investigate the fitness distribution of the nucleic acid genotype neighborhood in a sequence space for L-Arm binding aptamer. Although most mutants of the L-Arm-binding aptamer failed to retain their ligand-binding ability, two novel functional genotype neighborhoods were isolated by SELEX in silico and experimentally verified to have similar binding affinity (Kd = 69.3 M and 110.7 M) as the wild-type aptamer (Kd = 114.4 M). Based on data from the current study and previous research, mutational robustness is strongly influenced by the local base environment and ligand-binding mode, whereas bases distant from the binding pocket provide potential evolutionary pathways to approach global fitness maximum. Our work provides an example of successful application of SELEX in silico to optimize an aptamer and demonstrates the strong sensitivity of mutational robustness to the site of genetic variation.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of images of biotinylated Escherichia coli 70S ribosome particles, bound to streptavidin affinity grids, demonstrates that the image-quality of particles can be predicted by the image-quality of the monolayer crystalline support film. The quality of the Thon rings is also a good predictor of the image-quality of particles, but only when images of the streptavidin crystals extend to relatively high resolution. When the estimated resolution of streptavidin was 5 [A] or worse, for example, the ribosomal density map obtained from 22,697 particles went to only 9.5 [A], while the resolution of the map reached 4.0 [A] for the same number of particles, when the estimated resolution of streptavidin crystal was 4 [A] or better. It thus is easy to tell which images in a data set ought to be retained for further work, based on the highest resolution seen for Bragg peaks in the computed Fourier transforms of the streptavidin component. The refined density map obtained from 57,826 particles obtained in this way extended to 3.6 [A], a marked improvement over the value of 3.9 [A] obtained previously from a subset of 52,433 particles obtained from the same initial data set of 101,213 particles after 3-D classification. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that interaction with the air-water interface can damage particles when the sample becomes too thin. Streptavidin monolayer crystals appear to provide a good indication of when that is the case.",

    "abstract": "Mindboggle (http://mindboggle.info) is an open source brain morphometry platform that takes in preprocessed T1-weighted MRI data and outputs volume, surface, and tabular data containing label, feature, and shape information for further analysis. In this article, we document the software and demonstrate its use in studies of shape variation in healthy and diseased humans. The number of different shape measures and the size of the populations make this the largest and most detailed shape analysis of human brains every conducted. Brain image morphometry shows great potential for providing much-needed biological markers for diagnosing, tracking, and predicting progression of mental health disorders. Very few software algorithms provide more than measures of volume and cortical thickness, and more subtle shape measures may provide more sensitive and specific biomarkers. Mindboggle computes a variety of (primarily surface-based) shapes: area, volume, thickness, curvature, depth, Laplace-Beltrami spectra, Zernike moments, etc. We evaluate Mindboggles algorithms using the largest set of manually labeled, publicly available brain images in the world and compare them against state-of-the-art algorithms where they exist. All data, code, and results of these evaluations are publicly available.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBrains vary in many ways, including their shape. Analysing differences in shape between brains or changes in brain shape over time has been used to characterize morphology of diseased brains, but these analyses conventionally rely on simple volumetric shape measures. We believe that access to a greater variety of shape measures could provide greater sensitivity and specificity to morphological disturbances, and could aid in diagnosis, tracking, and prediction of the progression of mental health disorders. Mindboggle is open source software that provides neuroscientists (and indeed, anyone interested in computing shapes) tools for computing a variety of shape measures, including area, volume, thickness, curvature, geodesic depth, travel depth, Laplace-Beltrami spectra, and Zernike moments. In addition to algorithmic contributions, we conducted evaluations and applied Mindboggle to conduct the most detailed shape analysis of human brains.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput comparative genomics has changed our view of bacterial evolution and relatedness. Many genomic comparisons, especially those regarding the accessory genome that is variably conserved across strains in a species, are performed using assembled genomes. For completed genomes, an assumption is made that the entire genome was incorporated into the genome assembly, while for draft assemblies, often constructed from short sequence reads, an assumption is made that genome assembly is an approximation of the entire genome. To understand the potential effects of short read assemblies on the estimation of the complete genome, we downloaded all completed bacterial genomes from GenBank, simulated short reads, assembled the simulated short reads and compared the resulting assembly to the completed assembly. Although most simulated assemblies demonstrated little reduction, others were reduced by as much as 25%, which was correlated with the repeat structure of the genome. A comparative analysis of lost coding region sequences demonstrated that up to 48 CDSs or up to ~112,000 bases of coding region sequence, were missing from some draft assemblies compared to their finished counterparts. Although this effect was observed to some extent in 32% of genomes, only minimal effects were observed on pan-genome statistics when using simulated draft genome assemblies. The benefits and limitations of using draft genome assemblies should be fully realized before interpreting data from assembly-based comparative analyses.",

    "abstract": "A common approach to design genetic circuits is to compose gene expression cassettes together. While appealing, this modular approach is challenged by the fact that expression of each gene depends on the availability of transcriptional/translational resources, which is in turn determined by the presence of other genes in the circuit. This raises the question of how competition for resources by different genes affects a circuits behavior. Here, we create a library of genetic activation cascades in bacteria E. coli, where we explicitly tune the resource demand by each gene. We develop a general Hill-function-based model that incorporates resource competition effects through resource demand coefficients. These coefficients lead to non-regulatory interactions among genes that reshape circuits behavior. For the activation cascade, such interactions result in surprising biphasic or monotonically decreasing responses. Finally, we use resource demand coefficients to guide the choice of ribosome binding site (RBS) and DNA copy number to restore the cascades intended monotonically increasing response. Our results demonstrate how unintended circuits behavior arises from resource competition and provide a model-guided methodology to minimize the resulting effects.\\n\\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "How do people recognize and learn about complex functional structure? Taking inspiration from other areas of cognitive science, we propose that this is achieved by harnessing compositionality: complex structure is decomposed into simpler building blocks. We formalize this idea within the framework of Bayesian regression using a grammar over Gaussian process kernels, and compare this approach with other structure learning approaches. Participants consistently chose compositional (over non-compositional) extrapolations and interpolations of functions. Experiments designed to elicit priors over functional patterns revealed an inductive bias for compositional structure. Compositional functions were perceived as subjectively more predictable than non-compositional functions, and exhibited other signatures of predictability, such as enhanced memorability and reduced numerosity. Taken together, these results support the view that the human intuitive theory of functions is inherently compositional.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale analyses of cancer genomes are revealing patterns of mutations that suggest biologically significant ideas about many aspects of cancer, including carcinogenesis, classification, and preventive and therapeutic strategies. Among those patterns is \\\"mutual exclusivity\\\", a phenomenon observed when two or more mutations that are commonly observed in samples of a type of cancer are not found combined in individual tumors. We have been studying a striking example of mutual exclusivity: the absence of co-existing mutations in the KRAS and EGFR proto-oncogenes in human lung adenocarcinomas, despite the high individual frequencies of such mutations in this common type of cancer. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that toxic effects of the joint expression of KRAS and EGFR mutant oncogenes, rather than loss of any selective advantages conferred by a second oncogene that operates through the same signaling pathway, are responsible for the observed mutational pattern. We discuss the potential for understanding the physiological basis of such toxicity, for exploiting it therapeutically, and for extending the studies to other examples of mutual exclusivity.",

    "abstract": "A summary is presented of five mechanical parameters from human lower limb skeletal muscles critical for Hill-based muscle modeling: the optimal fiber length, the fiber pennation angle, the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), the unloaded tendon length, and the fast-twitch fiber fraction. The data presented are drawn from a total of 29 publications including human cadaver studies, in vivo imaging studies of live humans, musculoskeletal modeling studies, and combinations of these methods. Where possible, parameter values were adjusted from the referenced data to present them with consistent definitions (normalization of measured fiber lengths to optimal sarcomere length, and calculation of PCSA as the ratio of fiber volume to fiber length). It is seen that within a specific muscle, optimal fiber lengths are fairly consistent between studies, pennation angles and PCSAs vary widely between studies, and data for unloaded tendon length are comparatively sparse. Few studies have reported fiber type fractions for a large number of muscles. Guidelines for implementing these parameter values in muscle modeling and musculoskeletal modeling are suggested.\\n\\nUpdate HistoryO_LIDecember 2, 2016: original submission\\nC_LIO_LIDecember 3, 2016: discussion on maximum isometric force and specific tension added\\nC_LIO_LIDecember 6, 2016: minor edits for typos, clarity, and missing references\\nC_LIO_LIDecember 7, 2016: Tirrell et al.

    "abstract": "The germ cells of multicellular organisms protect their developmental potential through specialized mechanisms. A shared feature of germ cells from worms to humans is the presence of non-membrane-bound ribonucleoprotein organelles called germ granules. Depletion of germ granules in Caenorhabditis elegans (i.e., P granules) leads to sterility and in some germlines expression of the neuronal transgene unc-119::gfp and the muscle myosin MYO-3. Thus, P granules are hypothesized to maintain germ cell totipotency by preventing somatic development, although the mechanism by which P granules carry out this function is unknown. In this study, we performed transcriptome and single molecule RNA-FISH analyses of dissected P-granule-depleted gonads at different developmental stages. Our results demonstrate that P granules are necessary for adult germ cells to down-regulate spermatogenesis RNAs and to prevent the accumulation of numerous soma-specific RNAs. P-granule-depleted gonads that express the unc-119::gfp transgene also express many other genes involved in neuronal development and concomitantly lose expression of germ cell fate markers. Finally, we show that removal of either of two critical P-granule components, PGL-1 or GLH-1, is sufficient to cause germ cells to express UNC-119::GFP and MYO-3 and to display RNA accumulation defects similar to those observed after depletion of P granules. Our data identify P granules as critical modulators of the germline transcriptome and guardians of germ cell fate.",
