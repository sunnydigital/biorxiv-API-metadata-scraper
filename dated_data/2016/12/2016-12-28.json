    "abstract": "A model of genome evolution is proposed. Based on several general assumptions the evolutionary theory of a genome is formulated. Both the deterministic classical equation and the stochastic quantum equation are proposed. The classical equation is written in a form of of second-order differential equations on nucleotide frequencies varying in time. It is proved that the evolutionary equation can be put in a form of the least action principle and the latter can be used for obtaining the quantum generalization of the evolutionary law. The wave equation and uncertainty relation for the quantum evolution are deduced logically. Two fundamental constants of time dimension, the quantization constant and the evolutionary inertia, are introduced for characterizing the genome evolution. During speciation the large-scale rapid change of nucleotide frequency makes the evolutionary inertia of the dynamical variables of the genome largely decreasing or losing. That leads to the occurrence of quantum phase of the evolution. The observed smooth/sudden evolution is interpreted by the alternating occurrence of the classical and quantum phases. In this theory the probability of new-species formation is calculable from the first-principle. To deep the discussions we consider avian genome evolution as an example. More concrete forms on the assumed potential in fundamental equations, namely the diversity and the environmental potential, are introduced. Through the numerical calculations we found that the existing experimental data on avian macroevolution are consistent with our theory. Particularly, the law of the rapid post-Cretaceous radiation of neoavian birds can be understood in the quantum theory. Finally, the present work shows the quantum law may be more general than thought, since it plays key roles not only in atomic physics, but also in genome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs is a key feature of cortical dynamics. Such balance is arguably preserved in dendritic branches, yet its underlying mechanism and functional roles remain unknown. Here, by considering computational models of heterosynaptic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), we show that the detailed excitatory/inhibitory balance on dendritic branch is robustly achieved through heterosynaptic interaction between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The model well reproduces experimental results on heterosynaptic STDP, and provides analytical insights. Furthermore, heterosynaptic STDP explains how maturation of inhibitory neurons modulates selectivity of excitatory neurons in critical period plasticity of binocular matching. Our results propose heterosynaptic STDP as a critical factor in synaptic organization and resultant dendritic computation.\\n\\nSignificance statementRecent experimental studies have revealed that relative spike timings among neighboring Glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses on a dendritic branch significantly influences changes in synaptic efficiency of these synapses. This heterosynaptic form of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is potentially important for shaping the synaptic organization and computation of neurons, but its functional role remains elusive. Here, through computational modeling, we show that heterosynaptic plasticity causes the detailed balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs on the dendrite, at the parameter regime where previous experimental results are well reproduced. Our result reveals a potential principle of GABA-driven neural circuit formation.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionMicrobes typically form diverse communities of interacting species, whose activities have tremendous impact on the plants, animals, and humans they associate with1-3, as well as on the biogeochemistry of the entire planet4. The ability to predict the structure of these complex communities is crucial to understanding, managing, and utilizing them5. Here, we propose a simple, qualitative assembly rule that predicts community structure from the outcomes of competitions between small sets of species, and experimentally assess its predictive power using synthetic microbial communities. The rule's accuracy was evaluated by competing combinations of up to eight soil bacterial species, and comparing the experimentally observed outcomes to the predicted ones. Nearly all competitions resulted in a unique, stable community, whose composition was independent of the initial species fractions. Survival in three-species competitions was predicted by the pairwise outcomes with an accuracy of ~90%. Obtaining a similar level of accuracy in competitions between sets of seven or all eight species required incorporating additional information regarding the outcomes of the three-species competitions. Our results demonstrate experimentally the ability of a simple bottom-up approach to predict community structure. Such an approach is key for anticipating the response of communities to changing environments, designing interventions to steer existing communities to more desirable states, and, ultimately, rationally designing communities de novo6,7.",

JavaScript has been used to develop very fast, and user-friendly front-end tools for bioinformatic and phylogenetic analyses. However, no such toolkits are available using Node.js to conduct comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis.\\n\\nResults: To address this problem, I have developed, Phylo-Node, which was developed using Node.js and provides a stable and scalable toolkit that allows the user to go from sequence retrieval to phylogeny reconstruction. Phylo-Node can execute the analysis and process the resulting outputs from a suite of software options that provides tools for sequence retrieval, alignment, primer design, evolutionary modeling, and phylogeny reconstruction. Furthermore, Phylo-Node enables the user to deploy server dependent applications, and also provides simple integration and interoperation with other Node modules and languages using Node inheritance patterns, and a customized piping module to support the production of diverse pipelines.\\n\\nConclusions: Phylo-Node is open-source and freely available to all users without sign-up or login requirements.

    "abstract": "To demonstrate causal relationships between brain and behavior, investigators would like to guide brain stimulation using measurements of neural activity. Particularly promising in this context are electroen-cephalography (EEG) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), as they are linked by a reciprocity principle which, despite being known for decades, has not led to a formalism for relating EEG recordings to optimal stimulation parameters. Here we derive a closed-form expression for the TES configuration that optimally stimulates (i.e., targets) the sources of recorded EEG, without making assumptions about source location or distribution. We also derive a duality between TES targeting and EEG source localization, and demonstrate that in cases where source localization fails, so does the proposed targeting. Numerical simulations with realistic head models confirm these theoretical predictions and quantify the achieved stimulation in terms of focality and intensity. We show that constraining the stimulation currents automatically selects optimal montages that involve only a few (4-7) electrodes, with only incremental loss in performance. The proposed technique allows brain scientists and clinicians to rationally target the sources of observed EEG and thus overcomes a major obstacle to the realization of individualized or closed-loop brain stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Geoduck clams (Panopea generosa) are an increasingly important fishery and aquaculture product along the eastern Pacific coast from Baja California, Mexico to Alaska. These long-lived clams are highly fecund, though sustainable hatchery production of genetically diverse larvae is hindered by the lack of sexual dimorphism, resulting in asynchronous spawning of broodstock, unequal sex ratios, and low numbers of breeders. Development of assays of gonad physiology could indicate sex and maturation stage, as well as be used to assess the status of natural populations. Proteomic profiles were determined for three reproductive maturation stages in both male and female clams using data dependent acquisition (DDA) of gonad proteins. Gonad proteomes became increasingly divergent between males and females as maturation progressed. The DDA data was used to develop targets analyzed with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) in gonad tissue as well as hemolymph. The SRM assay yielded a suite of indicator peptides that can be used as an efficient assay to determine geoduck gonad maturation status. Application of SRM in hemolymph samples demonstrates this procedure could effectively be used to assess reproductive status in marine mollusks in a non-lethal manner.",

    "abstract": "Mediator is a conserved transcriptional co-activator that links transcription factors bound at enhancer elements to RNA Polymerase II. Mediator-RNA Polymerase II interactions can be sterically hindered by the Cyclin Dependent Kinase 8 (CDK8) module, a submodule of Mediator that acts to repress transcription in response to discrete cellular and environmental cues. The CDK8 module is conserved in all eukaryotes and consists of 4 proteins: CDK8, CYCLIN C (CYCC), MED12, and MED13. In this study, we have characterized the CDK8 module of Mediator in maize. The maize genome contains single copy genes for Cdk8, CycC, and Med13, and two genes for Med12. Analysis of expression data for the CDK8 module demonstrated that all five genes are broadly expressed in maize tissues, with ZmMed12a, ZmMed12b, and ZmMed13 exhibiting similar expression patterns. We performed a Dissociation (Ds) insertional mutagenesis, recovering two independent insertions in the ZmMed12a gene. One of these Ds insertions results in a truncation of the ZmMed12a transcript. Our molecular characterization of the maize CDK8 module, as well as transposon tagging of ZmMed12a, establish the basis for molecular and functional studies of these important transcriptional regulators in Zea mays.",

    "abstract": "A cognitive map has long been the dominant metaphor for hippocampal function, embracing the idea that place cells encode a geometric representation of space. However, evidence for predictive coding, reward sensitivity, and policy dependence in place cells suggests that the representation is not purely spatial. We approach this puzzle from a reinforcement learning perspective: what kind of spatial representation is most useful for maximizing future reward? We show that the answer takes the form of a predictive representation. This representation captures many aspects of place cell responses that fall outside the traditional view of a cognitive map. Furthermore, we argue that entorhinal grid cells encode a low-dimensional basis set for the predictive representation, useful for suppressing noise in predictions and extracting multiscale structure for hierarchical planning.",

Here we show nuclear envelope rupture is a shared feature that increases in standard culture after lamin-A knockdown, which causes nuclear loss of multiple DNA repair factors and increased DNA damage. Some repair factors are merely mis-localized to cytoplasm whereas others are partially depleted unless rescued by lamin-A expression. Compared to standard cultures on rigid glass coverslips, the growth of lamin-A low cells on soft matrix relaxes cytoskeletal stress on the nucleus, suppresses the mis-localization of DNA repair factors, and minimizes DNA damage nearly to wildtype levels. Conversely, constricted migration of the lamin-A low cells causes abnormally high levels of DNA damage, consistent with sustained loss of repair factors. The findings add insight into why monogenic progeroid syndromes that often associate with increased DNA damage and predominantly impact cells in stiff tissues result from mutations only in lamin-A or DNA repair factors.",

Using a designed bi-functional fusion protein TARBP-BTP, very recently we demonstrated knockdown of target genes in the brain of both A{beta}PP-PS1 (Alzheimers disease, AD) and wildtype C57BL/6 mice upon systemic delivery of a single dose of siRNA. In this report, we further substantiate this hypothesis through an extended study in A{beta}PP-PS1 mice, which upon treatment with seven doses of {beta}-secretase APP cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) siRNA, led to target-specific effects in the mouse brain. Concomitant gene silencing and consequent reduction in plaque load in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (>60%) in mice treated with TARBP-BTP:siRNA complex further led to improvement in spatial learning and memory, which was assessed and verified through Morris Water Maze test that revealed significant improvement in cognitive function. Moreover, the treatment did not induce any adverse effects as revealed by the histopathology of different organs. The work validates the efficiency of TARBP-BTP fusion protein as an efficient mediator of RNAi giving considerable scope for future intervention of neurodegenerative disorders of the CNS through the use of short nucleic acids as gene specific inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry is a powerful tool to study protein-protein interactions and protein conformations. Two linked peptides are ionized and fragmented to produce a tandem mass spectrum. In such an experiment, a tandem mass spectrum contains ions from two peptides. The peptide identification problem becomes a peptide-peptide pair identification problem. Currently, most existing tools dont search all possible pairs due to the quadratic time complexity. Consequently, a significant percentage of linked peptides are missed. In our earlier work, we developed a tool named ECL to search all pairs of peptides exhaustively. While ECL does not miss any linked peptides, it is very slow due to the quadratic computational complexity, especially when the database is large. Furthermore, ECL uses a score function without statistical calibration, while researchers1,2 have demonstrated that using a statistical calibrated score function can achieve a higher sensitivity than using an uncalibrated one.\\n\\nHere, we propose an advanced version of ECL, named ECL 2.0. It achieves a linear time and space complexity by taking advantage of the additive property of a score function. It can analyze a typical data set containing tens of thousands of spectra using a large-scale database containing thousands of proteins in a few hours. Comparison with other five state-of-the-art tools shows that ECL 2.0 is much faster than pLink, StavroX, ProteinProspector, and ECL. Kojak is the only one tool that is faster than ECL 2.0. But Kojak does not exhaustively search all possible peptide pairs. We also adopt an e-value estimation method to calibrate the original score. Comparison shows that ECL 2.0 has the highest sensitivity among the state-of-the-art tools. The experiment using a large-scale in vivo cross-linking data set demonstrates that ECL 2.0 is the only tool that can find PSMs passing the false discovery rate threshold. The result illustrates that exhaustive search and well calibrated score function are useful to find PSMs from a huge search space.",

    "abstract": "Microbiota influence diverse aspects of intestinal epithelial physiology and disease in part by controlling tissue-specific transcription of host genes. However, host genomic mechanisms mediating microbial control of host gene expression are poorly understood. Using an unbiased screening strategy, we found that the zebrafish Hepatic nuclear factor 4 alpha (Hnf4a) transcription factor specifically binds and activates a microbiota-suppressed intestinal epithelial transcriptional enhancer. Genetic analysis disclosed that zebrafish hnf4a activates nearly half of the genes that are suppressed by microbiota, suggesting microbiota negatively regulate Hnf4a. In support, analysis of genomic architecture in mouse intestinal epithelial cells revealed that microbiota colonization leads to activation or inactivation of hundreds of enhancers along with drastic genome-wide reduction of Hnf4a and Hnf4g occupancy. Interspecies meta-analysis suggests Hnf4a may mediate microbial contributions to inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis. These results indicate Hnf4a plays a critical conserved role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis in response to microbiota and inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Neural activity in vivo is primarily measured using extracellular somatic spikes, which provide limited information about neural computation. Hence, it is necessary to record from neuronal dendrites, which generate dendritic action potentials (DAP) and profoundly influence neural computation and plasticity. We measured neocortical sub- and supra-threshold dendritic membrane potential (DMP) from putative distal-most dendrites using tetrodes in freely behaving rats over multiple days with a high degree of stability and sub-millisecond temporal resolution. DAP firing rates were several fold larger than somatic rates. DAP rates were modulated by subthreshold DMP fluctuations which were far larger than DAP amplitude, indicting hybrid, analog-digital coding in the dendrites. Parietal DAP and DMP exhibited egocentric spatial maps comparable to pyramidal neurons. These results have important implications for neural coding and plasticity.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryMeasurement of cortical dendritic membrane potential for several days in freely behaving rats reveals disproportionate dendritic spiking and analog and digital coding.",

Despite the economic importance of these crops, the causal agents of the diseases belonging to the genus Phytophthora have not been completely characterized. In this study, we used an integrative approach that leveraged morphological, ecological, and genetic approaches to explore cryptic speciation within P. infestans sensu lato. We described a new Phytophthora species collected in Colombia from tree tomato (Solanum betaceum), a semi-domesticated fruit. All morphological traits and population genetic analyses, using microsatellite data and a reduced representation of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, support the description of the new species, Phytophthora betacei sp. nov. We have demonstrated that ecological differences are important in the persistence of P. infestans and P. betacei as genetically isolated units across an overlapping area in the northern Andes.",

    "abstract": "Cell differentiation is an important process in living organisms. Differentiation is mostly based on binary decisions with the progenitor cells choosing between two specific lineages. The differentiation dynamics have both deterministic and stochastic components. Several theoretical studies suggest that cell differentiation is a bifurcation phenomenon, well-known in dynamical systems theory. The bifurcation point has the character of a critical point with the system dynamics exhibiting specific features in its vicinity. These include the critical slowing down, rising variance and lag-1 autocorrelation function, strong correlations between the fluctuations of key variables and non-Gaussianity in the distribution of fluctuations. Recent experimental studies provide considerable support to the idea of criticality in cell differentiation and in other biological processes like the development of the fruit fly embryo. In this Review, an elementary introduction is given to the concept of criticality in cell differentiation. The correspondence between the signatures of criticality and experimental observations on blood cell differentiation in mice is further highlighted.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is involved in regulation of gene expression. Although modern methods profile DNA methylation at single CpG sites, methylation levels are usually averaged over genomic regions in the downstream analyses. In this study we demonstrate that single CpG methylation can serve as a more accurate predictor of gene expression compared to average promoter / gene body methylation. CpG positions with significant correlation between methylation and expression of a gene nearby (named CpG traffic lights) are evolutionary conserved and enriched for exact TSS positions and active enhancers. Among all promoter types, CpG traffic lights are especially enriched in poised promoters. Genes that harbor CpG traffic lights are associated with development and signal transduction. Methylation levels of individual CpG traffic lights vary between cell types dramatically with the increased frequency of intermediate methylation levels, indicating cell population heterogeneity in CpG methylation levels. Being in line with the concept of the inherited stochastic epigenetic variation, methylation of such CpG positions might contribute to transcriptional regulation. Alternatively, one can hypothesize that traffic lights are markers of absent gene expression resulting from inactivation of their regulatory elements. The CpG traffic lights provide a promising insight into mechanisms of enhancer activity and gene regulation linking methylation of single CpG to expression.",

    "abstract": "One in five people with Down syndrome (DS) are born with an atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), an incidence 2,000 times higher than in the euploid population. The genetic loci that contribute to this risk are poorly understood. In this study, we tested two hypotheses: 1) individuals with DS carrying chromosome 21 copy number variants (CNVs) that interrupt exons may be protected from AVSD, because these CNVs return AVSD susceptibility loci back to disomy, and 2) individuals with DS carrying chromosome 21 genes spanned by microduplications are at greater risk for AVSD because these microduplications boost the dosage of AVSD susceptibility loci beyond a tolerable threshold. We tested 198 case individuals with DS+AVSD and 211 control individuals with DS and a normal heart using a custom microarray with dense probes tiled on chromosome 21 for array CGH. We found that neither an individual chromosome 21 CNV nor any individual gene intersected by a CNV was associated with AVSD in DS. Burden analyses revealed that African American controls had more bases covered by rare deletions than did African American cases. Inversely, we found that Caucasian cases had more genes intersected by rare duplications than did Caucasian controls. Pathway analyses indicated copy number perturbations of genes involved in protein heterotrimerization and histone methylating proteins. Finally, we showed that previously DS+AVSD-associated common CNVs on chromosome 21 are likely false positives. This research adds to the swell of evidence indicating that DS-associated AVSD is similarly heterogeneous, as is AVSD in the euploid population.",
