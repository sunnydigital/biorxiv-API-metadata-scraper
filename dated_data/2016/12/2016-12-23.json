    "abstract": "To efficiently learn from feedback, cortical networks need to update synaptic weights on multiple levels of cortical hierarchy. An effective and well-known algorithm for computing such changes in synaptic weights is the error back-propagation algorithm. However, in the back-propagation algorithm, the change in synaptic weights is a complex function of weights and activities of neurons not directly connected with the synapse being modified, whereas the changes in biological synapses are determined only by the activity of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons. Several models have been proposed that approximate the back-propagation algorithm with local synaptic plasticity, but these models require complex external control over the network or relatively complex plasticity rules. Here we show that a network developed in the predictive coding framework can efficiently perform supervised learning fully autonomously, employing only simple local Hebbian plasticity. Furthermore, for certain parameters, the weight change in the predictive coding model converges to that of the back-propagation algorithm. This suggests that it is possible for cortical networks with simple Hebbian synaptic plasticity to implement efficient learning algorithms in which synapses in areas on multiple levels of hierarchy are modified to minimize the error on the output.",

    "abstract": "1To extract patterns from neuroimaging data, various techniques, including statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, have been explored to ultimately aid in Alzheimers disease diagnosis of older adults in both clinical and research applications. However, identifying the distinctions between Alzheimers brain data and healthy brain data in older adults (age > 75) is challenging due to highly similar brain patterns and image intensities. Recently, cutting-edge deep learning technologies have been rapidly expanding into numerous fields, including medical image analysis. This work outlines state-of-the-art deep learning-based pipelines employed to distinguish Alzheimers magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI data from normal healthy control data for the same age group. Using these pipelines, which were executed on a GPU-based high performance computing platform, the data were strictly and carefully preprocessed. Next, scale and shift invariant low- to high-level features were obtained from a high volume of training images using convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. In this study, functional MRI data were used for the first time in deep learning applications for the purposes of medical image analysis and Alzheimers disease prediction. These proposed and implemented pipelines, which demonstrate a significant improvement in classification output when compared to other studies, resulted in high and reproducible accuracy rates of 99.9% and 98.84% for the fMRI and MRI pipelines, respectively. Additionally, the subject-level classification was performed that resulted in the averaged accuracy rate of 94.32% and 97.88% for the fMRI and MRI pipeline respectively. Finally, a decision making algorithm was designed for the subject-level classification and improved the averaged accuracy rate to 97.77% for fMRI and 100% MRI subjects.",

    "abstract": "Genetic incompatibilities can emerge as a by-product of genetic divergence. According to Dobzhansky and Muller, alleles at different loci that have fixed in different genetic backgrounds may be incompatible when brought together in a hybrid. Orr showed that the number of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) should accumulate faster than linearly--i.e., snowball--as two lineages diverge. Several studies have attempted to test the snowball model using data from natural populations. One limitation of these studies is that they have focused on predictions of the snowball model but not on its underlying assumptions. Here we use a computational model of RNA folding to test both predictions and assumptions of the snowball model. In this model, two populations are allowed to evolve in allopatry on a holey fitness landscape. We find that the number of DMIs involving pairs of loci (i.e., simple DMIs) does not snowball--rather, it increases approximately linearly with divergence. We show that the probability of emergence of a simple DMI is approximately constant, as assumed by the snowball model. However, simple DMIs can disappear after they have arisen, contrary to the assumptions of the snowball model. This occurs because simple DMIs become complex (i.e., involve alleles at three or more loci) as a result of later substitutions. We introduce a modified snowball model--the melting snowball model--where simple DMIs can become complex after they appear. The melting snowball model can account for the results of the RNA folding model. We also find that complex DMIs are common and, unlike simple ones, do snowball. Reproductive isolation, however, does not snowball because DMIs do not act independently of each other. We conclude that the RNA folding model supports the central prediction of the snowball model that the number of DMIs snowballs, but challenges some of its underlying assumptions.",

To evaluate these deleterious mutations in the cassava genome, we constructed a cassava haplotype map using deep sequencing from 241 diverse accessions and identified over 28 million segregating variants. We found that, 1) while domestication modified starch and ketone metabolism pathways for human consumption, the concomitant bottleneck and clonal propagation resulted in a large proportion of fixed deleterious amino acid changes, raised the number of deleterious mutations by 26%, and shifted the mutational burden towards common variants; 2) deleterious mutations are ineffectively purged due to limited recombination in cassava genome; 3) recent breeding efforts maintained the yield by masking the most damaging recessive mutations in the heterozygous state, but unable to purge the mutation burden, which should be a key target for future cassava breeding.",

    "abstract": "The variable responses of sensory neurons tend to be weakly correlated (spike-count correlation, rsc). This is widely thought to reflect noise in shared afferents, in which case rsc can limit the reliability of sensory coding. However, it could also be due to feedback from higher-order brain regions. Currently, the relative contribution of these sources is unknown. We addressed this by recording from populations of V1 neurons in macaques performing different discrimination tasks involving the same visual input. We found that the structure of rsc(the way rsc varied with neuronal stimulus preference) changed systematically with task instruction. Therefore, even at the earliest stage in the cortical visual hierarchy, rsc structure during task performance primarily reflects feedback dynamics. Consequently, previous proposals for how rsc constrains sensory processing need not apply. Furthermore, we show that correlations between the activity of single neurons and choice depend on feedback engaged by the task.",

We have tested a subset of these lines for integration efficiency and reporter gene expression levels. We have also generated a smaller collection of other lines expressing other genetically encoded fluorescent molecules in the eyes and a number of other transgenic reagents that will be useful for functional studies in these species.

    "abstract": "We construct a model of cell reprogramming (the conversion of fully differentiated cells to a state of pluripotency, known as induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs) which builds on key elements of cell biology viz. cell cycles and cell lineages. Although reprogramming has been demonstrated experimentally, much of the underlying processes governing cell fate decisions remain unknown. This work aims to bridge this gap by modelling cell types as a set of hierarchically related dynamical attractors representing cell cycles. Stages of the cell cycle are characterised by the configuration of gene expression levels, and reprogramming corresponds to triggering transitions between such configurations. Two mechanisms were found for reprogramming in a two level hierarchy: cycle specific perturbations and a noise induced switching. The former corresponds to a directed perturbation that induces a transition into a cycle-state of a different cell type in the potency hierarchy (mainly a stem cell) whilst the latter is a priori undirected and could be induced, e.g., by a (stochastic) change in the cellular environment. These reprogramming protocols were found to be effective in large regimes of the parameter space and make specific predictions concerning reprogramming dynamics which are broadly in line with experimental findings.",

Motivated by specific examples of cell movement in tissues, pigment protein movement in pigment cells and animal movement near watering holes, we consider a class of radially-symmetric anisotropic diffusion problems, which we call the star problem. The corresponding diffusion tensor D(x) is radially symmetric with isotropic diffusion at the origin. We show that the anisotropic geometry of the environment can lead to strong aggregations and blow-up at the origin. We classify the nature of aggregation and blow-up solutions and provide corresponding numerical simulations. A surprising element of this strong aggregation mechanism is that it is entirely based on geometry and does not derive from chemotaxis, adhesion or other well known aggregating mechanisms. We use these aggregate solutions to discuss the process of pigmentation changes in animals, cancer invasion in an oriented fibrous habitat (such as collagen fibres), and sheep distributions around watering holes.\\n\\nJTB classification21.050, 21.160, 52.250, 71.060",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms by which the gain of the neuronal input-output function may be modulated have been the subject of much investigation. However, little is known of the role of dendrites in neuronal gain control. New optogenetic experimental paradigms based on spatial profiles or patterns of light stimulation offer the prospect of elucidating many aspects of single cell function, including the role of dendrites in gain control. We thus developed a model to investigate how competing excitatory and inhibitory input within the dendritic arbor alters neuronal gain, incorporating kinetic models of opsins into our modeling to ensure it is experimentally testable. To investigate how different topologies of the neuronal dendritic tree affect the neurons input-output characteristics we generate branching geometries which replicate morphological features of most common neurons, but keep the number of branches and overall area of dendrites approximately constant. We found a relationship between a neurons gain modulability and its dendritic morphology, with neurons with bipolar dendrites with a moderate degree of branching being most receptive to control of the gain of their input-output relationship. The theory was then tested and confirmed on two examples of realistic neurons: 1) layer V pyramidal cells - confirming their role in neural circuits as a regulator of the gain in the circuit in addition to acting as the primary excitatory neurons, and 2) stellate cells. In addition to providing testable predictions and a novel application of dual-opsins, our model suggests that innervation of all dendritic subdomains is required for full gain modulation, revealing the importance of dendritic targeting in the generation of neuronal gain control and the functions that it subserves. Finally, our study also demonstrates that neurophysiological investigations which use direct current injection into the soma and bypass the dendrites may miss some important neuronal functions, such as gain modulation.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryO_LIGain modulability indicated by dendritic morphology\\nC_LIO_LIPyramidal cell-like shapes optimally receptive to modulation\\nC_LIO_LIAll dendritic subdomains required for gain modulation, partial illumination is insufficient\\nC_LIO_LIComputational optogenetic models improve and refine experimental protocols\\nC_LI",

A few methods have been developed to infer admixture history based on ancestral tracks. Nonetheless, these methods suffered the same flaw that only population admixture history under some specific models can be inferred. In addition, the inference of history might be biased or even unreliable if the specific model is deviated from the real situation. To address this problem, we firstly proposed a general discrete admixture model to describe the admixture history with multiple ancestral populations and multiple-wave admixtures. We next deduced the length distribution of ancestral tracks under the general discrete admixture model. We further developed a new method, MultiWaver, to explore the multiple-wave admixture histories. Our method could automatically determine an optimal admixture model based on the length distribution of ancestral tracks, and estimate the corresponding parameters under this optimal model. Specifically, we used a likelihood ratio test (LRT) to determine the number of admixture waves, and implemented an expectation??maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate parameters. We used simulation studies to validate the reliability and effectiveness of our method. Finally, good performance was observed when our method was applied to real datasets of African Americans, Mexicans, Uyghurs, and Hazaras.",

Although this has been an active area of research, it has been difficult to overcome the time and memory demands while improving the quality of the OTU assignments. Here we developed a new OTU assignment algorithm that iteratively reassigns sequences to new OTUs to optimize the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), a measure of the quality of OTU assignments. To assess the new algorithm, OptiClust, we compared it to ten other algorithms using 16S rRNA gene sequences from two simulated and four natural communities. Using the OptiClust algorithm, the MCC values averaged 15.2 and 16.5% higher than the OTUs generated when we used the average neighbor and distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH, respectively. Furthermore, on average, OptiClust was 94.6-times faster than the average neighbor algorithm and just as fast as distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH. An empirical analysis of the efficiency of the algorithms showed that the time and memory required to perform the algorithm scaled quadratically with the number of unique sequences in the dataset. The significant improvement in the quality of the OTU assignments over previously existing methods will significantly enhance downstream analysis by limiting the splitting of similar sequences into separate OTUs and merging of dissimilar sequences into the same OTU. The development of the OptiClust algorithm represents a significant advance that is likely to have numerous other applications.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGene duplication is a major factor contributing to evolutionary novelty, and the contraction or expansion of gene families has often been associated with morphological, physiological and environmental adaptations. The study of homologous genes helps us to understand the evolution of gene families. It plays a vital role in finding ancestral gene duplication events as well as identifying genes that have diverged from a common ancestor under positive selection. There are various tools available, such as MSOAR, OrthoMCL and HomoloGene, to identify gene families and visualise syntenic information between species, providing an overview of syntenic regions evolution at the family level. Unfortunately, none of them provide information about structural changes within genes, such as the conservation of ancestral exon boundaries amongst multiple genomes. The Ensembl GeneTrees computational pipeline generates gene trees based on coding sequences and provides details about exon conservation, and is used in the Ensembl Compara project to discover gene families.\\n\\nFindingsA certain amount of expertise is required to configure and run the Ensembl Compara GeneTrees pipeline via command line. Therefore, we have converted the command line Ensembl Compara GeneTrees pipeline into a Galaxy workflow, called GeneSeqToFamily, and provided additional functionality.

    "abstract": "Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) alter chromatin structure by promoting the interaction of chromatin-modifying complexes with nucleosomes. The majority of chromatin-modifying complexes contain multiple domains that preferentially interact with modified histones, leading to speculation that these domains function in concert to target nucleosomes with distinct combinations of histone PTMs. In S. cerevisiae, the NuA3 histone acetyltransferase complex contains three domains, the PHD finger in Yng1, the PWWP domain in Pdp3, and the YEATS domain in Taf14, which in vitro bind to H3K4 methylation, H3K36 methylation, and acetylated and crotonylated H3K9 respectively. However the relative in vivo contributions of these histone PTMs in targeting NuA3 is unknown. Here we show that in vivo H4K4 and H3K36 methylation, but not acetylated or crotonylated H3K9, recruit NuA3 to transcribed genes. Through genome-wide colocalization and by mutational interrogation, we demonstrate that the PHD finger of Yng1, and the PWWP domain of Pdp3 independently target NuA3 to H3K4 and H3K36 methylated chromatin respectively. In contrast, we find no evidence to support the YEATS domain of Taf14 functioning in NuA3 recruitment. Collectively our results suggest that the presence of multiple histone-PTM binding domains within NuA3, rather than restricting it to nucleosomes containing distinct combinations of histone PTMs, can serve to increase the range of nucleosomes bound by the complex. Interestingly however, the simple presence of NuA3 is insufficient to ensure acetylation of the associated nucleosomes, suggesting a secondary level of acetylation regulation that does not involve control of HAT-nucleosome interactions",

    "abstract": "Our knowledge of disease genetics has advanced rapidly during the past decade, with the advent of high-throughput genotyping technologies such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, few methodologies were developed and systemic studies performed to identify novel drug candidates utilizing GWAS data. In this study we focus on drug repositioning, which is a cost-effective approach to shorten the developmental process of new therapies. We proposed a novel framework of drug repositioning by comparing GWAS-imputed transcriptome with drug expression profiles from the Connectivity Map. The approach was applied to 7 psychiatric disorders. We discovered a number of novel repositioning candidates, many of which are supported by preclinical or clinical evidence. We found that the predicted drugs are significantly enriched for known psychiatric medications, or therapies considered in clinical trials. For example, drugs repurposed for schizophrenia are strongly enriched for antipsychotics (p = 4.69E-06), while those repurposed for bipolar disorder are enriched for antipsychotics (p = 2.26E-07) and antidepressants (p = 1.17E-05). These findings provide support to the usefulness of GWAS signals in guiding drug discoveries and the validity of our approach in drug repositioning. We also present manually curated lists of top repositioning candidates for each disorder, which we believe will serve as a useful resource for researchers.",

    "abstract": "The formation of mammalian chromatin domains was investigated by analyzing the domain/isochore connection. This showed that LADs correspond to GC-poor isochores and are compositionally flat, flexible chromatin structures because of the local nucleosome depletions associated with the presence of oligo-As. In contrast, TADs correspond to GC-rich isochores that consist of single or (much more frequently) multiple, GC peaks that shape the single or multiple, loops of TADs. Indeed, the increasing nucleosome depletions linked to the GC gradients of isochore peaks lead to an increasing chromatin flexibility (accompanied by an increasing accessibility and decreasing supercoiling). In conclusion, isochores not only encode but also mold chromatin architecture; while architectural proteins play a role in closing and insulating TAD loops. An extension of this model concerns the encoding of open and closed chromosome compartments by alternating GC-rich and GC-poor isochores, the interactions among compartments defining the 3-D chromosome folding.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEscherichia coli bovine mastitis is a disease of significant economic importance in the dairy industry. Molecular characterization of mastitis-associated E. coli (MAEC) did not result in the identification of common traits. Nevertheless, a mammary pathogenic E. coli (MPEC) pathotype has been proposed suggesting virulence traits that differentiate MAEC from commensal E. coli. The present study was designed to investigate the MPEC pathotype hypothesis by comparing the genomes of MAEC and commensal bovine E. coli.\\n\\nResultsWe sequenced the genomes of eight E. coli isolated from bovine mastitis cases and six fecal commensal isolates from udder-healthy cows. We analyzed the phylogenetic history of bovine E. coli genomes by supplementing this strain panel with eleven bovine-associated E. coli from public databases. The majority of the isolates originate from phylogroups A and B1, but neither MAEC nor commensal strains could be unambiguously distinguished by phylogenetic lineage. The gene content of both MAEC and commensal strains is highly diverse and dominated by their phylogenetic background. Although individual strains carry some typical E. coli virulence-associated genes, no traits important for pathogenicity could be specifically attributed to MAEC. Instead, both commensal strains and MAEC have very few gene families enriched in either pathotype. Only the aerobactin siderophore gene cluster was enriched in commensal E. coli within our strain panel.\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first characterization of a phylogenetically diverse strain panel including several MAEC and commensal isolates. With our comparative genomics approach we could not confirm previous studies that argue for a positive selection of specific traits enabling MAEC to elicit bovine mastitis. Instead, MAEC are facultative and opportunistic pathogens recruited from the highly diverse bovine gastrointestinal microbiota. Virulence-associated genes implicated in mastitis are a by-product of commensalism with the primary function to enhance fitness in the bovine gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, we put the definition of the MPEC pathotype into question and suggest to designate corresponding isolates as MAEC.",

Recently, there has been a growing interest to examine the temporal dynamics of the brain's network activity. While different approaches to capture fluctuations in brain connectivity have been proposed, there have been few attempts to quantify these fluctuations using temporal network theory. Temporal network theory is an extension of network theory that has been successfully applied to the modeling of dynamic processes in economics, social sciences and engineering. The objective of this paper is twofold: (i) to present a detailed description of the central tenets and outline measures from temporal network theory; (ii) apply these measures to a resting-state fMRI dataset to illustrate their utility. Further, we discuss the interpretation of temporal network theory in the context of the dynamic functional brain connectome.

    "abstract": "Mutations in a microbial population can increase the frequency of a genotype not only by increasing its exponential growth rate, but also by decreasing its lag time or adjusting the yield (resource efficiency). The contribution of multiple life-history traits to selection is a critical question for evolutionary biology as we seek to predict the evolutionary fates of mutations. Here we use a model of microbial growth to show there are two distinct components of selection corresponding to the growth and lag phases, while the yield modulates their relative importance. The model predicts rich population dynamics when there are tradeo[ff]s between phases: multiple strains can coexist or exhibit bistability due to frequency-dependent selection, and strains can engage in rock-paper-scissors interactions due to non-transitive selection. We characterize the environmental conditions and patterns of traits necessary to realize these phenomena, which we show to be readily accessible to experiments. Our results provide a theoretical framework for analyzing high-throughput measurements of microbial growth traits, especially interpreting the pleiotropy and correlations between traits across mutants. This work also highlights the need for more comprehensive measurements of selection in simple microbial systems, where the concept of an ordinary fitness landscape breaks down.",

Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are particularly at risk, and outbreaks are frequently reported in ICUs. K. pneumoniae is also part of the healthy human microbiome, providing a potential reservoir for HA infection. However, the frequency of K. pneumoniae gut colonization and its contribution to HA infections are not well characterized.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted one-year prospective cohort study of ICU patients. Participants (n=498) were screened for rectal and throat carriage of K. pneumoniae shortly after admission, and clinical information was extracted from hospital records.K. pneumoniae isolated from screening swabs and clinical diagnostic samples were characterized using whole genome sequencing. Genomic and epidemiological data were combined to identify likely transmission events.\\n\\nResults and ConclusionsK. pneumoniae carriage frequencies were estimated at 6% (95% CI, 3%-8%) amongst ICU patients admitted direct from the community, and 19% (95% CI, 14% - 51%) amongst those who had recent contact with healthcare. Gut colonisation on admission was significantly associated with subsequent K. pneumoniae infection (infection risk 16% vs 3%, OR=6.9, p<0.001), and genome data indicated a match between carriage and infection isolates in most patients. Five likely transmission chains were identified, resulting in six infections (12% of K. pneumoniae infections in ICU). In contrast, 49% of K. pneumoniae infections were caused by a strain that was unique to the patient, and 48% of patients with K. pneumoniae infections who participated in screening were positive for prior colonisation. These data confirm K. pneumoniae colonisation is a significant risk factor for subsequent infection in ICU, and indicate that half of all K. pneumoniae infections result from patients own microbiota. Screening for colonisation on admission could limit risk of infection in the colonised patient and others.",

    "abstract": "Fishers geometric model was originally introduced to argue that complex adaptations must occur in small steps because of pleiotropic constraints. When supplemented with the assumption of additivity of mutational effects on phenotypic traits, it provides a simple mechanism for the emergence of genotypic epistasis from the nonlinear mapping of phenotypes to fitness. Of particular interest is the occurrence of reciprocal sign epistasis, which is a necessary condition for multipeaked genotypic fitness landscapes. Here we compute the probability that a pair of randomly chosen mutations interacts sign-epistatically, which is found to decrease with increasing phenotypic dimension n, and varies non-monotonically with the distance from the phenotypic optimum. We then derive expressions for the mean number of fitness maxima in genotypic landscapes composed of all combinations of L random mutations. This number increases exponentially with L, and the corresponding growth rate is used as a measure of the complexity of the landscape. The dependence of the complexity on the model parameters is found to be surprisingly rich, and three distinct phases characterized by different landscape structures are identified. Our analysis shows that the phenotypic dimension, which is often referred to as phenotypic complexity, does not generally correlate with the complexity of fitness landscapes and that even organisms with a single phenotypic trait can have complex landscapes. Our results further inform the interpretation of experiments where the parameters of Fisher's model have been inferred from data, and help to elucidate which features of empirical fitness landscapes can be described by this model.",

Disruption of ties through social exclusion has a marked effect on our thoughts and feelings; however, such effects can be tempered by broader social network resources. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 80 male adolescents to investigate how social exclusion modulates functional connectivity within and across brain networks involved in social pain and understanding the mental states of others (i.e., mentalizing). Furthermore, using objectively logged friendship network data, we examine how individual variability in brain reactivity to social exclusion relates to the density of participants friendship networks, an important aspect of social network structure. We find increased connectivity within a set of regions previously identified as a mentalizing system during exclusion relative to inclusion. These results are consistent across the regions of interest as well as a whole-brain analysis. Next, examining how social network characteristics are associated with task-based connectivity dynamics, participants who showed greater changes in connectivity within the mentalizing system when socially excluded by peers had less dense friendship networks. This work provides novel insight to understand how distributed brain systems respond to social and emotional challenges, and how such brain dynamics might vary based on broader social network characteristics.",

In addition to implicit error-driven remapping, explicit re-aiming strategies also contribute to sensorimotor adaptation. However, no studies to date have examined the role of M1 in implicit learning in isolation from explicit strategies. Because the application of explicit strategies requires time, it is possible to emphasise implicit learning by controlling the time available to prepare movement. Here, we examined the role of M1s role in implicit adaptation to rotated visual feedback whilst suppressing the use of explicit re-aiming strategies by limiting movement preparation times to less than 350ms. Perturbing M1 activity via single-pulse TMS during adaptation to a 30 {degrees} rotation of visual feedback did not alter the rate or extent of error compensation, but elicited poorer retention in post-adaptation trials with no perturbation. This work shows that M1 is critical in the retention of new visuomotor maps as a result of implicit adaptation to a perturbation in sensory feedback when strategic error correction processes are suppressed.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIAdaptation of movements to perturbations occurs through explicit and implicit processes.\\nC_LIO_LIHere, explicit strategies were suppressed by shortening movement preparation time.\\nC_LIO_LIPerturbing motor cortex (M1) with TMS selectively impaired retention but not acquisition of sensorimotor adaptation.\\nC_LIO_LIM1 plays a crucial role in retention of sensorimotor adaptation obtained via implicit learning.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Genetic sequences from pathogens can provide information about infectious disease dynamics that may supplement or replace information from other epidemiological observations. Currently available methods first estimate phylogenetic trees from sequence data, then estimate a transmission model conditional on these phylogenies. Outside limited classes of models, existing methods are unable to enforce logical consistency between the model of transmission and that underlying the phylogenetic reconstruction. Such conflicts in assumptions can lead to bias in the resulting inferences. Here, we develop a general, statistically efficient, plug-and-play method to jointly estimate both disease transmission and phylogeny using genetic data and, if desired, other epidemiological observations. This method explicitly connects the model of transmission and the model of phylogeny so as to avoid the aforementioned inconsistency. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through simulation and apply it to estimate stage-specific infectiousness in a subepidemic of HIV in Detroit, Michigan. In a supplement, we prove that our approach is a valid sequential Monte Carlo algorithm. While we focus on how these methods may be applied to population-level models of infectious disease, their scope is more general. These methods may be applied in other biological systems where one seeks to infer population dynamics from genetic sequences, and they may also find application for evolutionary models with phenotypic rather than genotypic data.",

Here we report the results of 16S rRNA amplicon-based phylum-to-genus taxonomic analysis of Cladophora-associated bacterial epibiota sampled in replicate from three microsites and at six times during the open-water season of 2014, from the same lake locale (Picnic Point, Lake Mendota, Dane Co., WI, USA) explored by high throughput sequencing studies in two previous years. Statistical methods were used to test null hypotheses that the bacterial community: 1) is homogeneous across microsites tested, and 2) does not change over the course of a growth season or among successive years. Results indicated a dynamic microbial community that is more strongly influenced by sampling day during the growth season than by microsite variation. A surprising diversity of bacterial genera known to be associated with the key function of methane-oxidation (methanotrophy)-including relatively high-abundance of Crenothrix, Methylomonas, and Methylocaldum-showed intra-seasonal and inter-annual variability possibly related to temperature differences, and microsite preferences possibly related to variation in methane abundance. By contrast, a core assemblage of bacterial genera seems to persist over a growth season and from year-to-year, possibly transmitted by a persistent attached host resting stage.",

This revealed lncRNAs that function in concert with transcription factors to regulate {beta} cell-specific transcriptional networks. We further demonstrate that lncRNA PLUTO affects local three-dimensional chromatin structure and transcription of PDX1, encoding a key {beta} cell transcription factor, and that both PLUTO and PDX1 are downregulated in islets from donors with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. These results implicate lncRNAs in the regulation of {beta} cell-specific transcription factor networks.",

    "abstract": "To provide new insight into the pathogenesis of neurocognitive impairments (NCI) in HIV infection, we used the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) algorithm to analyze pathway dysregulations in gene expression profiles of HIV-infected patients with or without NCI and HIV encephalitis (HIVE). While HIVE was characterized by widespread inflammation and tissue damage, gene expression evidence of induction of interferon (IFN), cytokines and tissue injury was apparent in all brain regions studied before the emergence of NCI. Various degrees of white matter changes were present in all HIV-infected subjects and were the primary manifestation in patients with NCI in the absence of HIVE. The latter showed a distinct pattern of immune activation with induction of chemokines, cytokines, {beta}-defensins, and limited IFN induction.\\n\\nAltogether results indicate that significant neuroinflammation and neuronal suffering precede NCI. Patients with NCI without HIVE showed a predominantly white matter dysfunction with a distinct pattern of immune activation.",

    "abstract": "A recent paper by Karin, Swisa, Glaser, Dor, and Alon introduced the mathematical notion of dynamical compensation (DC) in biological circuits, arguing that DC helps explain important features of glucose homeostasis as well as other key physiological regulatory mechanisms. The present paper establishes a connection between DC and two well-known notions in systems biology: system equivalence and parameter (un)identifiability. This recasting leads to effective tests for verifying DC in mathematical models.",

    "abstract": "Despite its popularity, characterization of subpopulations with transcript abundance is subject to a significant amount of noise. We propose to use effective and expressed nucleotide variations (eeSNVs) from scRNA-seq as alternative features for tumor subpopulation identification. We developed a linear modeling framework, SSrGE, to link eeSNVs associated with gene expression. In all the datasets tested, eeSNVs achieve better accuracies than gene expression for identifying subpopulations. Previously validated cancer-relevant genes are also highly ranked, confirming the significance of the method. Moreover, SSrGE is capable of analyzing coupled DNA-seq and RNA-seq data from the same single cells, demonstrating its value in integrating multi-omics single cell techniques. In summary, SNV features from scRNA-seq data have merits for both subpopulation identification and linkage of genotype-phenotype relationship. The method SSrGE is available at https://github.com/lanagarmire/SSrGE.",
