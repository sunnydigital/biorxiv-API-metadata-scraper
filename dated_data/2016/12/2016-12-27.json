    "abstract": "Experimental studies have revealed evidence of both parts-based and holistic representations of objects and faces in the primate visual system. However, it is still a mystery how such seemingly contradictory types of processing can coexist within a single system. Here, we propose a novel theory called mixture of sparse coding models, inspired by the formation of category-specific subregions in the inferotemporal (IT) cortex. We developed a hierarchical network that constructed a mixture of two sparse coding submodels on top of a simple Gabor analysis. The submodels were each trained with face or non-face object images, which resulted in separate representations of facial parts and object parts. Importantly, evoked neural activities were modeled by Bayesian inference, which had a top-down explaining-away effect that enabled recognition of an individual part to depend strongly on the category of the whole input. We show that this explaining-away effect was indeed crucial for the units in the face submodel to exhibit significant selectivity to face images over object images in a similar way to actual face-selective neurons in the macaque IT cortex. Furthermore, the model explained, qualitatively and quantitatively, several tuning properties to facial features found in the middle patch of face processing in IT as documented by Freiwald, Tsao, and Livingstone (2009). These included, in particular, tuning to only a small number of facial features that were often related to geometrically large parts like face outline and hair, preference and anti-preference of extreme facial features (e.g., very large/small inter-eye distance), and reduction of the gain of feature tuning for partial face stimuli compared to whole face stimuli. Thus, we hypothesize that the coding principle of facial features in the middle patch of face processing in the macaque IT cortex may be closely related to mixture of sparse coding models.",

    "abstract": "Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia via nitrite to nitrate, has always been considered to be catalyzed by the concerted activity of ammonia and nitrite-oxidizing microorganisms. Only recently, complete ammonia oxidizers ( comammox), which oxidize ammonia to nitrate on their own, were identified in the bacterial genus Nitrospira, previously assumed to contain only canonical nitrite oxidizers. Nitrospira are widespread in nature, but for assessments of the distribution and functional importance of comammox Nitrospira in ecosystems, cultivation-independent tools to distinguish comammox from strictly nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospira are required. Here we developed new PCR primer sets that specifically target the amoA genes coding for subunit A of the distinct ammonia monooxygenase of comammox Nitrospira. While existing primers capture only a fraction of the known comammox amoA diversity, the new primer sets cover as much as 95% of the comammox amoA clade A and 92% of the clade B sequences in a reference database containing 326 comammox amoA genes with sequence information at the primer binding sites. Application of the primers to 13 samples from engineered systems (a groundwater well, drinking water treatment and wastewater treatment plants) and other habitats (rice paddy and forest soils, rice rhizosphere, brackish lake sediment and freshwater biofilm) detected comammox Nitrospira in all samples and revealed a considerable diversity of comammox in most habitats. Excellent primer specificity for comammox amoA was achieved by avoiding the use of highly degenerate primer preparations and by using equimolar mixtures of oligonucleotides that match existing comammox amoA genes. Quantitative PCR with these equimolar primer mixtures was highly sensitive and specific, and enabled the efficient quantification of clade A and clade B comammox amoA gene copy numbers in environmental samples. The measured relative abundances of comammox Nitrospira, compared to canonical ammonia oxidizers, were highly variable across environments. The new comammox amoA-targeted primers will enable more encompassing studies of nitrifying microorganisms in diverse ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization, every year more than a billion people are infected with vector-borne diseases worldwide. There are no vaccines for most vector-borne diseases. Vector control, therefore, is often the only way to prevent outbreaks. Despite the major impact of vectors on human health, knowledge gaps exist regarding their natural population dynamics. Even the most basic information--such as spatiotemporal abundance-- is not available. Mosquitoes transmit malaria and the viruses causing Yellow Fever, West Nile, Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika in the Americas. The Americas have a long history of mosquito control efforts, including the unsustained but successful Aedes aegypti eradication initiative. In the US, municipalities have independently created agencies for mosquito control and monitoring. We propose that the ensemble of US mosquito control agencies can, and should, be used to develop a national--and potentially international--system for Cross-Scale Vector Monitoring and Control (CSVMaC), in which local level monitoring and control efforts are cross-linked by unified real-time data streaming to build the data capital needed to gain a mechanistic understanding of vector population dynamics. Vectors, and the pathogens they transmit, know no jurisdictions. The vision of CSVMaC is, therefore, to provide data for (i) the general study of mosquito ecology and (ii) to inform vector control during epidemics/outbreaks that impact multiple jurisdictions (i.e., counties, states, etc.). We reveal >1000 mosquito control agencies in the US with enormous troves of data that are hidden among many data silos. For CSVMaC, we propose the creation of a nationally-coordinated open-access database to collate mosquito data. The database would provide scientific and public health communities with highly resolved spatiotemporal data on arboviral disease vectors, empowering new interventions and insights while leveraging pre-existing human efforts, operational infrastructure, and investments already funded by taxpayers.",

    "abstract": "The in vitro study of neural progenitors is based around the idea that defined culture conditions can emulate an environment which maintains an undifferentiated state and self-renewal capability of explanted progenitor cells, culminating in the growth of neurospheres. Neurosphere culture systems are used to study cells of physiological origin as well as transformed cells. In the case of the cerebellar granule cell lineage, neurosphere cultures have been produced from medulloblastoma tumors, while non-transformed granule progenitors are reported to be transient in vitro. SHH signaling is a key signaling pathway with roles in morphogenesis and cell proliferation in the central nervous system, in particular, involved in mitogenic signaling within the context of postnatal cerebellar granule cell expansion. In this paper, I demonstrate that in addition to commonly used mitogens such as EGF and bFGF, the SHH pathway agonist SAG, as well as genetic activation of SHH signaling by PTCH1 deletion, can lead to the growth of neurospheres from postnatal day 7 (p7) cerebellar explants.\\n\\nI also show that these neurosphere adhere to the cerebellar GCP lineage.. Strikingly, mSS cells can be maintained indefinitely in culture, as demonstrated by extensive clonogenic capability, assayed over a period of 10 weeks. In the context of self-renewal, I assay gene expression of POU3f2, POU5f1, NANOG, and SOX2, genes associated with neural progenitors, which I find expressed in mSS cells. Importantly, mSS cultures are continuously dependent on SAG for their clonogenic potential and SHH pathway activation, assayed by expression of GLI1, PTCH1 and NMYC. In addition to the aforementioned extensive self-renewal capability, mSS neurosphere cultures also maintain the ability to differentiate. In vitro differentiation leads to formation of cells with typical granule cell morphology and which are positive for beta3-tubulin and express GABRA6.\\n\\nOverall, my work demonstrates that by applying culture conditions which are tailored towards biological characteristics of specific regions of the central nervous system the paradigm of the neurosphere can be expanded to include lineages not previously studied in this way. In particular, I apply this principle to unmask the property of cells from the GCP lineage as having extensive self-renewal capability in vitro.",

Despite the obvious importance of these exceptionally powerful redox enzymes, their mode of action remains enigmatic and their activity and stability under process conditions are hard to control. By using enzyme assays, mass spectrometry and experiments with labeled oxygen atoms, we show that H2O2, and not O2 as previously thought, is the co-substrate of LPMOs. By controlling H2O2 supply, stable reaction kinetics and high enzymatic rates are achieved, the LPMOs work under anaerobic conditions, and the need for adding stoichiometric amounts of reductants is alleviated.

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of loci influencing complex human traits, however, their biological mechanism of action remains mostly unknown. Recent accumulation of functional genomics ( omics) including metabolomics data opens up opportunities to provide a new insight into the functional role of specific changes in the genome. Functional genomic data are characterized by high dimensionality, presence of (strong) statistical dependencies between traits, and, potentially, complex genetic control. Therefore, analysis of such data asks for development of specific statistical genetic methods.\\n\\nResultsWe propose a network-based, conditional approach to evaluate the impact of genetic variants on omics phenotypes (conditional GWAS, cGWAS). For each trait of interest, based on biological network, we select a set of other traits to be used as covariates in GWAS. The network could be reconstructed either from biological pathway databases or directly from the data. We evaluated our approach using data from a population-based KORA study (n=1,784, 1.7 M SNPs) with measured metabolomics data (151 metabolites) and demonstrated that our approach allows for identification of up to five additional loci not detected by conventional GWAS. We show that this gain in power is achieved through increased precision of genetic effect estimates, and in presence of specific  contra-intuitive pleiotropic scenarios (when genetic and environmental sources of covariance are acting in opposite manner). We justify existence of such scenarios, and discuss possible applications of our method beyond metabolomics.\\n\\nConclusionsWe demonstrate that in context of metabolomics network-based, conditional genome-wide association analysis is able to dramatically increase power of identification of loci with specific  contra-intuitive pleiotropic architecture. Our method has modest computational costs, can utilize summary level GWAS data, and is applicable to other omics data types. We anticipate that application of our method to new and existing data sets will facilitate progress in understanding genetic bases of control of molecular and complex phenotypes.\\n\\nShort abstractWe propose a network-based, conditional approach for genome-wide analysis of multivariate omics phenotypes.

    "abstract": "Whether AMPA receptors (AMPARs) enter into neuronal synapses, by exocytosis from an internal pool, or by diffusion from an external membrane-bound pool, is hotly contested. 3D super-resolution fluorescent nanoscopy to measure the dynamics and placement of AMPAR is a powerful method for addressing this issue. However, probe size and accessibility to tightly packed spaces can be limiting. We have therefore labeled AMPARs with differently sized fluorophores: small organic fluorescent dyes (~ 4 nm), small quantum dots (sQD, ~10 nm in diameter), or big (commercial) quantum dots (bQD, ~ 20 nm in diameter). We then compared their diffusion rate, trajectories, and placement with respect to a postsynaptic density (PSD) protein, Homer 1c. Labeled with the small probes of sQDs or organic fluorophores, we find that AMPARs are located largely within PSDs (~73-93%), and generally reside in \\\"nanodomains\\\" with constrained diffusion. In contrast, when labeled with bQDs, only 5-10% of AMPARs are within PSDs. The results can be explained by relatively free access, or lack thereof, to synaptic clefts of the AMPARs when labeled with small or big probes, respectively. This implies that AMPARs primarily enter PSDs soon after their exocytosis and not from a large diffusive pool of extrasynaptic AMPARs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuman natural killer (NK) cell activity is regulated by a family of killer-cell Ig-like receptors (KIR) that bind human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I. Combinations of KIR and HLA genotypes are associated with disease, including susceptibility to viral infection and disorders of pregnancy. KIR2DL1 binds HLA-C alleles of group C2 (Lys80) and KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 bind HLA-C alleles of group C1 (Asn80). However, this model does not capture allelic diversity in HLA-C or the impact of HLA-bound peptides. The goal of this study was to determine the extent to which the endogenous HLA-C peptide repertoire can influence the specific binding of inhibitory KIR to HLA-C allotypes.\\n\\nResultsThe impact of HLA-C bound peptide on inhibitory KIR binding was investigated taking advantage of the fact that HLA-C*05:01 (HLA-C group 2, C2) and HLA-C*08:02 (HLA-C group 1, C1) have identical sequences apart from the key KIR specificity determining epitope at residues 77 and 80. Endogenous peptides were eluted from HLA-C*05:01 and used to test the peptide dependence of KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL2/3 binding to HLA-C*05:01 and HLA-C*08:02 and subsequent impact on NK cell function. Specific binding of KIR2DL1 to the C2 allotype occurred with the majority of peptides tested. In contrast, KIR2DL2/3 binding to the C1 allotype occurred with only a subset of peptides. Cross-reactive binding of KIR2DL2/3 with the C2 allotype was restricted to even fewer peptides. Unexpectedly, two peptides promoted binding of the C2 allotype-specific KIR2DL1 to the C1 allotype. We showed that presentation of endogenous peptides, or predicted HIV Gag peptides, by HLA-C can promote KIR cross-reactive binding.\\n\\nConclusionsKIR2DL2/3 binding to C1 is more peptide selective than that of KIR2DL1 binding to C2, which provides an explanation for why KIR2DL3-C1 interactions appear weaker than KIR2DL1-C2. In addition, cross-reactive binding of KIR is characterized by even higher peptide selectivity. We demonstrate a hierarchy of functional peptide selectivity of KIR-HLA-C interactions with relevance to NK cell biology and human disease associations. This selective peptide sequence-driven binding of KIR provides a potential mechanism for pathogen as well as self-peptide to modulate NK cell activation through altering levels of inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Major histocompatibility (MHC) genes encode proteins that play a central role in vertebrates adaptive immunity to parasites. MHC loci are among the most polymorphic in vertebrates genomes, inspiring many studies to identify evolutionary processes driving MHC polymorphism within populations, and divergence between populations. Leading hypotheses include balancing selection favoring rare alleles within populations, and spatially divergent selection. These hypotheses do not always produce diagnosably distinct predictions, causing many studies of MHC to yield inconsistent or ambiguous results. We suggest a novel strategy to distinguish balancing versus divergent selection on MHC, taking advantage of natural admixture between parapatric populations. With divergent selection, immigrant alleles will be more infected and less fit because they are susceptible to novel parasites in their new habitat. With balancing selection, locally-rare immigrant alleles will be more fit (less infected). We tested these contrasting predictions using threespine stickleback from three replicate pairs of parapatric lake and stream habitats. We found numerous positive and negative associations between particular MHC II{beta} alleles and particular parasite taxa. A few allele-parasite comparisons supported balancing selection, others supported divergent selection between habitats. But, there was no overall tendency for fish with immigrant MHC alleles to be more or less heavily infected. Instead, locally rare MHC alleles (not necessarily immigrants) were associated with heavier infections. Our results illustrate the complex relationship between MHC II{beta} allelic variation and spatially varying multi-species parasite communities: different hypotheses may be concurrently true for different allele-parasite combinations.",

To better understand evolutionary dynamics in this context, we select Escherichia coli for faster migration through a porous environment, a process which depends on both motility and growth. We find that a trade-off between swimming speed and growth rate constrains the evolution of faster migration. Evolving faster migration in rich medium results in slow growth and fast swimming, while evolution in minimal medium results in fast growth and slow swimming. In each condition parallel genomic evolution drives adaptation through different mutations. We show that the trade-off is mediated by antagonistic pleiotropy through mutations that affect negative regulation.

    "abstract": "Knowledge of the food web structure and complexity are central to better understand ecosystem functioning. A food-web approach includes both species and energy flows among them, providing a natural framework for characterizing species ecological roles and the mechanisms through which biodiversity influences ecosystem dynamics. Here we present for the first time a high-resolution food web for a marine ecosystem at Potter Cove (northern Antarctic Peninsula). Eleven food web properties were analyzed in order to document network complexity, structure and topology. We found a low linkage density (3.4), connectance (0.04) and omnivory percentage (45), as well as a short path length (1.8) and a low clustering coefficient (0.08). Furthermore, relating the structure of the food web to its dynamics, an exponential degree distribution (in- and out-links) was found. This suggests that the Potter Cove food web may be vulnerable if the most connected species became locally extinct. For two of the three more connected functional groups, competition overlap graphs imply high trophic interaction between demersal fish and niche specialization according to feeding strategies in amphipods. On the other hand, the prey overlap graph shows also that multiple energy pathways of carbon flux exist across benthic and pelagic habitats in the Potter Cove ecosystem. Although alternative food sources might add robustness to the web, network properties (low linkage density, connectance and omnivory) suggest fragility and potential trophic cascade effects.",
