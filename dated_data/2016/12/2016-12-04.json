    "abstract": "Proteins localized to mitochondria by a carboxyl-terminal tail anchor (TA) play roles in apoptosis, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial protein import. To reveal characteristics of TAs that may be important for mitochondrial targeting, we focused our attention upon the TA of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fis1 protein. Specifically, we generated a library of Fis1p TA variants fused to the Gal4 transcription factor, then, using next-generation sequencing, revealed which Fis1p TA mutations inhibited membrane insertion and allowed Gal4p activity in the nucleus. Prompted by our global analysis, we subsequently analyzed the ability of individual Fis1p TA mutants to localize to mitochondria. Our findings suggest that the membrane-associated domain of Fis1p TA may be bipartite in nature, and we encountered evidence that the positively charged patch at the carboxyl-terminus of Fis1p is required for both membrane insertion and organelle specificity. Furthermore, lengthening or shortening the Fis1 TA by up to three amino acids did not inhibit mitochondrial targeting, arguing against a model in which TA length directs insertion of TAs at specific organelles. Most importantly, positively charged residues were more acceptable at several positions within the membrane-associated domain of the Fis1p TA than negatively charged residues. These findings, emerging from the first high-resolution analysis of an organelle targeting sequence by deep mutational scanning, provide strong, in vivo evidence that lysine and arginine can \\\"snorkel,\\\" or become stably incorporated within a lipid bilayer by placing terminal charges of their side chains at the membrane interface.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "The delineation of conservation units (CUs) is a challenging issue that has profound implications for minimizing the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. CU delineation typically seeks to prioritize evolutionary significance and genetic methods play a pivotal role in the delineation process by quantifying overall differentiation between populations. While CUs that primarily reflect overall genetic differentiation do protect adaptive differences between distant populations, they do not necessarily protect adaptive variation within highly connected populations. Advances in genomic methodology facilitate the characterization of adaptive genetic variation, but the potential utility of this information for CU delineation is unclear. Here we use genomic methods to investigate the evolutionary basis of premature migration in Pacific salmon, a complex behavioral and physiological adaptation that exists within highly-connected populations and has experienced severe declines. Strikingly, we find that premature migration is associated with the same single locus across multiple populations in each of two different species. Patterns of variation at this locus suggest that the premature migration alleles arose from a single evolutionary event within each species and were subsequently spread to distant populations through straying and positive selection. Our results reveal that complex adaptive variation can depend on rare mutational events at a single locus, demonstrate that CUs reflecting overall genetic differentiation can fail to protect evolutionarily significant variation that has substantial ecological and societal benefits, and suggest that a supplemental framework for protecting specific adaptive variation will sometimes be necessary to prevent the loss of significant biodiversity and ecosystem services.",

Compared to other genome editing platforms, Cpf1 offers distinct advantages, such as the ability to easily target multiple genes simultaneously3, as well as low rates of off-target activity4, 5. However, the Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6 Cpf1 (AsCpf1), which has been successfully harnessed for genome editing, can only robustly cleave target sites preceded by a TTTV protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), which may limit its practical utility. To address this limitation, we used a structure- guided saturation mutagenesis screen to increase the targeting range of Cpf1. We engineered two variants of AsCpf1 with the mutations S542R/K607R and S542R/K548V/N552R that can cleave target sites with TYCV/CCCC and TATV PAMs, respectively, with enhanced activities in vitro and in human cells. Genome-wide assessment of off-target activity indicated that these variants retain a high level of DNA targeting specificity, which can be further improved by introducing mutations in non-PAM-interacting domains. Together, these variants increase the targeting range of AsCpf1 to one cleavage site for every ~8.7 bp in non-repetitive regions of the human genome, providing a useful addition to the CRISPR/Cas genome engineering toolbox.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we present a theoretical framework combining experimental characterizations and analytical calculus to capture the firing rate input-output properties of single neurons in the fluctuation-driven regime. Our framework consists of a two-step procedure to treat independently how the dendritic input translates into somatic fluctuation variables, and how the latter determine action potential firing. We use this framework to investigate the functional impact of the heterogeneity in firing responses found experimentally in young mice layer V pyramidal cells. We first design and calibrate in vitro a simplified morphological model of layer V pyramidal neurons with a dendritic tree following Rall's branching rule. Then, we propose an analytical derivation for the membrane potential fluctuations at the soma as a function of the properties of the synaptic input in dendrites. This mathematical description allows us to easily emulate various forms of synaptic input: either balanced, unbalanced, synchronized, purely proximal or purely distal synaptic activity. We find that those different forms of input activity lead to various impact on the membrane potential fluctuations properties, thus raising the possibility that individual neurons will differentially couple to specific forms of activity as a result of their different firing response. We indeed found such a heterogeneous coupling between synaptic input and firing response for all types of presynaptic activity. This heterogeneity can be explained by different levels of cellular excitability in the case of the balanced, unbalanced, synchronized and purely distal activity. A notable exception appears for proximal dendritic inputs: increasing the input level can either promote firing response in some cells, or suppress it in some other cells whatever their individual excitability. This behavior can be explained by different sensitivities to the speed of the fluctuations, which was previously associated to different levels of sodium channel inactivation and density. Because local network connectivity rather targets proximal dendrites, our results suggest that this aspect of biophysical heterogeneity might be relevant to neocortical processing by controlling how individual neurons couple to local network activity.",

    "abstract": "Do the frequencies of disease mutations in human populations reflect a simple balance between mutation and purifying selection? What other factors shape the prevalence of disease mutations? To begin to answer these questions, we focused on one of the simplest cases: recessive mutations that alone cause lethal diseases or complete sterility. To this end, we generated a hand-curated set of 417 Mendelian mutations in 32 genes, reported to cause a recessive, lethal Mendelian disease. We then considered analytic models of mutation-selection balance in infinite and finite populations of constant sizes and simulations of purifying selection in a more realistic demographic setting, and tested how well these models fit allele frequencies estimated from 33,370 individuals of European ancestry. In doing so, we distinguished between CpG transitions, which occur at a substantially elevated rate, and three other mutation types. The observed frequency for CpG transitions is slightly higher than expectation but close, whereas the frequencies observed for the three other mutation types are an order of magnitude higher than expected. This discrepancy is even larger when subtle fitness effects in heterozygotes or lethal compound heterozygotes are taken into account. In principle, higher than expected frequencies of disease mutations could be due to widespread errors in reporting causal variants, compensation by other mutations, or balancing selection. It is unclear why these factors would have a greater impact on variants with lower mutation rates, however. We argue instead that the unexpectedly high frequency of disease mutations and the relationship to the mutation rate likely reflect an ascertainment bias: of all the mutations that cause recessive lethal diseases, those that by chance have reached higher frequencies are more likely to have been identified and thus to have been included in this study. Beyond the specific application, this study highlights the parameters likely to be important in shaping the frequencies of Mendelian disease alleles.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWhat determines the frequencies of disease mutations in human populations? To begin to answer this question, we focus on one of the simplest cases: mutations that cause completely recessive, lethal Mendelian diseases. We first review theory about what to expect from mutation and selection in a population of finite size and further generate predictions based on simulations using a realistic demographic scenario of human evolution. For a highly mutable type of mutations, such as transitions at CpG sites, we find that the predictions are close to the observed frequencies of recessive lethal disease mutations. For less mutable types, however, predictions substantially under-estimate the observed frequency. We discuss possible explanations for the discrepancy and point to a complication that, to our knowledge, is not widely appreciated: that there exists ascertainment bias in disease mutation discovery. Specifically, we suggest that alleles that have been identified to date are likely the ones that by chance have reached higher frequencies and are thus more likely to have been mapped. More generally, our study highlights the factors that influence the frequencies of Mendelian disease alleles.",

Participants were tested in a contrast discrimination task: at the beginning of each trial, one location on the screen was cued and a subsequent contrast judgment was then more likely (70%) to be performed in that location. Replicating previous results, we found that the point of subjective equality (PSE) was elevated for a collinear, relative to an orthogonal, surround. While the PSE was similar for validly and invalidly cued trials, the just noticeable difference (JND) was larger for invalid cue trials, and for collinear, relative to orthogonal surround, suggesting that while OSSS affects both perceived contrast and sensitivity, voluntary attention affects only perceptual sensitivity. In another experiment no informative cue was provided, and attention was distributed over the entire display. In this case, JND and PSE were shifted depending on the contrast of the distractor, suggesting that OSSS is affected by the allocation of visual-spatial attention, but only under conditions of distributed attention.",

Acting as first responders, microorganisms can mitigate, exacerbate, and/or serve as predictors for water quality, yet we know little about their community structure or ecology at the whole river scale for large rivers. We collected both biological (16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicons) and physicochemical data from 38 MSR sites over nearly 3000 km from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. Our results revealed a microbial community composed of similar taxa to other rivers but with unique trends in the relative abundance patterns among phyla, OTUs, and the core microbiome.

Within MSR microbial assemblages we identified subgroups of OTUs from the phyla Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Oomycetes, and Heterokonts that were associated with, and predictive of, the important eutrophication nutrients nitrate and phosphate.

    "abstract": "SUMMARY STATEMENTThe study of nanog mutants reveals that Nanog is required only for extraembryonic tissue development, not in embryonic cells.\\n\\nABSTRACTThe role of the zebrafish transcription factor Nanog has been controversial. It has been suggested that Nanog is primarily required for the formation of the extraembryonic yolk syncytial layer (YSL) and only indirectly regulates gene expression in embryonic cells. By contrast, a more recent study has proposed that Nanog directly regulates transcription in embryonic cells during zygotic genome activation. To clarify the roles of Nanog, we performed a detailed analysis of zebrafish nanog mutants. While zygotic nanog mutants survive to adulthood, maternal-zygotic and maternal mutants exhibit developmental arrest at the blastula stage. In the absence of Nanog, the YSL fails to form and embryonic tissue detaches from the yolk. Zygotic transcription of a subset of embryonic genes is affected in nanog mutants but both the YSL and embryonic phenotype can be rescued by providing nanog mRNA in YSL precursors. Notably, nanog mutant cells transplanted into wild-type hosts proliferate and contribute to embryonic tissues from all germ layers. These results indicate that zebrafish Nanog is necessary for YSL formation but is not directly required for embryonic cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial chromosome replication is regulated from a single replication origin (ori) that receives cell cycle signals. Following replication, bacteria often use the parABS partition system with a centromere-like parS locus to place the chromosomes into the daughter cells. Our knowledge of cell cycle regulation is incomplete and we searched for novel regulators of chromosome replication. Here we show that in the cell cycle model Caulobacter crescentus a novel DNA-binding protein promotes both the initiation of chromosome replication and the earliest step of chromosome partitioning. We used biochemical fractionation to identify a protein (OpaA) that preferentially binds to mutated ori DNA that also increases ori-plasmid replication in vivo. OpaA represents a previously unknown class of DNA-binding proteins. opaA gene expression is essential and sufficient OpaA levels are required for the correct timing of chromosome replication. Whole genome ChIP-seq identified the genomic binding sites for OpaA, with the strongest associations at the parABS locus near ori. Using molecular-genetic and fluorescence microscopy experiments, we showed that OpaA also promotes the first step of chromosome partitioning, the initial separation of the duplicated parS loci following ori replication. This separation occurs before the parABS mechanism and it coincides with the regulatory step that splits the symmetry of the chromosomes so that they are placed at distinct cell-poles which develop into replicating and non-replicating cell-types. We propose that OpaA coordinates replication with the poorly understood mechanism of early chromosome separation. opaA lethal suppressor and antibiotic experiments argue that future studies be focused on the mechanistic roles for transcription and translation at this critical step of the cell cycle.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryLike all organisms, bacteria must replicate their chromosomes and move them into the newly dividing cells. Eukaryotes use non-overlapping phases, first for chromosome replication (S-phase) followed by mitosis (M-phase) when the completely duplicated chromosomes are separated. However, bacteria combine both phases so chromosome replication and chromosome separation (termed chromosome \\\"partitioning\\\") overlap. In many bacteria, including Caulobacter crescentus, chromosome replication initiates from a single replication origin (ori) and the first duplicated regions of the chromosome immediately begin \\\"partitioning\\\" towards the cell poles long before the whole chromosome has finished replication. This partitioning movement uses the centromere-like DNA called \\\"parS\\\" that is located near the ori. Here we identify a completely novel type of DNA-binding protein called OpaA and we show that it acts at both ori and parS. The timing and coordination of overlapping chromosome replication and partitioning phases is a special regulatory problem for bacteria. We further demonstrate that OpaA is selectively required for the initiation of chromosome replication at ori and likewise that OpaA is selectively required for the initial partitioning of parS. Therefore, we propose that OpaA is a novel regulator that coordinates chromosome replication with the poorly understood mechanism of early chromosome separation.",

    "abstract": "The role of DNA methylation in development, divergence, and the response to environmental stimuli is of substantial interest in ecology and evolutionary biology. Measuring genome-wide DNA methylation is increasingly feasible using sodium bisulfite sequencing. Here, we analyze simulated and published data sets to demonstrate how effect size, kinship/population structure, taxonomic differences, and cell type heterogeneity influence the power to detect differential methylation in bisulfite sequencing data sets. Our results reveal that the effect sizes typical of evolutionary and ecological studies are modest, and will thus require data sets larger than those currently in common use. Additionally, our findings emphasize that statistical approaches that ignore the properties of bisulfite sequencing data (e.g., its count-based nature) or key sources of variance in natural populations (e.g., population structure or cell type heterogeneity) often produce false negatives or false positives, thus leading to incorrect biological conclusions. Finally, we provide recommendations for handling common issues that arise in bisulfite sequencing analyses and a freely available R Shiny application for simulating and performing power analyses on bisulfite sequencing data. This app, available at www.tung-lab.org/protocols-and-software.html, allows users to explore the effects of sequencing depth, sample size, population structure, and expected effect size, tailored to their own system.",

    "abstract": "A mRNAs translation rate is controlled by several sequence determinants, including the presence of RNA structures within the N-terminal regions of its coding sequences. However, the physical rules that govern when such mRNA structures will inhibit translation remain unclear. Here, we introduced systematically designed RNA hairpins into the N-terminal coding region of a reporter protein with steadily increasing distances from the start codon, followed by characterization of their mRNA and expression levels in E. coli. We found that the mRNAs; translation rates were repressed, by up to 1410-fold, when mRNA structures overlapped with the ribosomes footprint. In contrast, when the mRNA structure was located outside the ribosomes footprint, translation was repressed by less than 2-fold. By combining our measurements with biophysical modeling, we determined that the ribosomal footprint extends 13 nucleotides into the N-terminal coding region and, when a mRNA structure overlaps or partially overlaps with the ribosomal footprint, the free energy to unfold only the overlapping structure controlled the extent of translation repression. Overall, our results provide precise quantification of the rules governing translation initiation at N-terminal coding regions, improving the predictive design of post-transcriptional regulatory elements that regulate translation rate.",

    "abstract": "Chronic airway infections by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa are major cause of mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. While this bacterium has been extensively studied for its virulence mechanisms, biofilm growth and immune evasion within the CF airways, comparatively little is known about the nutrient sources that sustain its growth in vivo. Respiratory mucins represent a potentially abundant bioavailable nutrient source, though we have recently shown that canonical pathogens inefficiently use these host glycoproteins as a growth substrate. Yet, given that P. aeruginosa, particularly in its biofilm mode of growth is thought to grow slowly in vivo, the inefficient use of mucin glycoproteins may have relevance to its persistence within the CF airways. To this end, here we use whole genome fitness analysis combining transposon mutagenesis with high throughput sequencing (TnSeq) to identify genetic determinants required for P. aeruginosa growth using intact purified mucins as a sole carbon source. Our analysis reveals a biphasic growth phenotype, during which the glyoxylate pathway and amino acid biosynthetic machinery are required for mucin utilization. Secondary analyses confirmed the simultaneous liberation and consumption of acetate during mucin degradation and revealed a central role for the extracellular proteases LasB and AprA. Together, these studies identified the P. aeruginosa genes required for mucin-based nutrient acquisition and reveal a host-pathogen dynamic that may contribute to its persistence within the CF airways.",

For the first time, we report non-cancer human health characterization factors for commonly used ionic liquids. On the one hand, literature related to environmental aspects of ionic liquids either promotes their environmentally friendly green aspects due to their negligible volatility (no air emissions). On the other hand, a great deal of literature promotes their non-green aspects due to the high toxicity values of certain ionic liquids towards living organisms. In this study, we attempt to integrate these two different diverging opinions to look at the concept of the greenness of ionic liquids from a larger point of view (i.e. from a life cycle assessment perspective).",

Although recent studies suggest that attention can alter appearance, it has been argued that the reported appearance changes reflect response bias. Here, we provide a resolution to this debate by showing that attention has different effects on appearance and response bias depending on stimulus visibility. In a contrast judgment task where the contrast of attended and unattended stimuli varied across a full range of contrast values, human participants exhibited a substantial amount of response bias to the attended stimulus, when stimuli were hard to see. However, when stimuli were easier to see, response bias decreased and attention primarily increased perceived contrast. These results help constrain philosophical arguments about the cognitive penetrability of perception and reconcile the long-standing debate about the attention effect on appearance and response bias.",

    "abstract": "Attention supports the selection of relevant sensory information from competing irrelevant sensory information. This selective processing is thought to be supported via the attentional gain amplification of sensory responses evoked by attended compared to unattended stimuli. However, recent studies in highly trained subjects suggest that attentional gain plays a relatively modest role and that other types of neural modulations - such as a reduction in neural noise - better explain attention-related changes in behavior. We hypothesized that the amount of training may alter neural mechanisms that support attentional selection in visual cortex. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the influence of training on attentional modulations of stimulus-evoked visual responses by recording electroencephalography (EEG) from humans performing a selective visuospatial attention task over the course of one month. Early in training, visuospatial attention induced a robust attentional gain amplification of sensory-evoked responses in contralateral visual cortex that emerged within ~100ms after stimulus onset, and a quantitative model based on signal detection theory (SDT) successfully linked this attentional gain amplification to attention-related improvements in behavior. However, after training, this attentional gain amplification of visual responses was almost completely eliminated and modeling suggested that noise reduction was required to link the amplitude of visual responses with attentional modulations of behavior. These findings suggest that the neural mechanisms supporting selective attention can change as a function of training and expertise, and help to bridge different results from studies carried out in different model systems that require substantially different amount of training.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum is known to be critically involved in sensorimotor adaptation. Changes in cerebellar function alter behaviour when compensating for sensorimotor perturbations, as shown by non-invasive stimulation of the cerebellum and studies involving patients with cerebellar degeneration. It is known, 24 however, that behavioural responses to sensorimotor perturbations reflect both explicit processes (such as volitional aiming to one side of a target to counteract a rotation of visual feedback) and implicit, error-driven updating of sensorimotor maps. The contribution of the cerebellum to these explicit and implicit processes remains unclear. Here, we examined the role of the cerebellum in sensorimotor adaptation to a 30{degrees} rotation of visual feedback of hand position during target-reaching, when the capacity to use explicit processes was manipulated by controlling movement preparation times. Explicit re-aiming was suppressed in one condition by requiring subjects to initiate their movements within 300ms of target presentation, and permitted in another condition by requiring subjects to wait approximately 1050ms after target presentation before movement initiation. Similar to previous work, applying anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; 1.5mA) to the right cerebellum during adaptation resulted in faster compensation for errors imposed by the rotation. After exposure to the rotation, we evaluated implicit remapping in no-feedback trials after providing participants with explicit knowledge that the rotation had been removed. Crucially, movements were more adapted in these no-feedback trials following cerebellar anodal tDCS than after sham stimulation in both long and short preparation groups. This suggests that cerebellar anodal tDCS increased implicit remapping during sensorimotor adaptation irrespective of preparation time constraints. This work shows that the cerebellum is critical in the formation of new visuomotor maps that correct perturbations in sensory feedback, both when explicit processes are suppressed and when allowed during sensorimotor adaptation.",

Previous studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have found low genetic differentiation among most of these groups, possibly due to demographic factors, ongoing gene flow, and/or recent divergence. These species were heavily depleted due to bycatch in the ETP yellowfin tuna fishery. Because population structure is important for accurate management of the recovery of these species, we collected whole mitochondrial genome sequences from 104 spinner and 76 spotted dolphins to test structure hypotheses at multiple hierarchical levels. Our results showed significant differences between subspecies of spotted (FST: 0.0125; P = 0.0402) and spinner dolphins (FST: 0.0133; P = 0.034), but no support for the division of existing offshore stocks of spotted dolphins or Tres Marias spinner dolphins. We compare these results to previous results of genome-wide nuclear SNP data and suggest high haplotype diversity, female dispersal, male philopatry, or relative power of the two datasets explains the differences observed. Our results further support a genetic basis for biologically meaningful management units at the subspecies level, and provide a critical component to mitigating historical and continued fishery interactions.",

Despite high heritability estimates, a genetic etiology for most sporadic ALS remains elusive. Here we report the epigenetic profiling of five monozygotic twin pairs discordant for ALS in whom previous genome sequencing excluded a genetic basis for their disease discordance. By studying cytosine methylation patterns in peripheral blood DNA we identified thousands of large between-twin differences at individual CpGs. While the specific sites of difference were largely idiosyncratic to a twin pair, a proportion (involving GABA signalling) were common to all affected individuals. In both instances the differences occurred within genes and pathways related to neurobiological function and dysfunction. Our findings reveal widespread changes in epigenetic marks in ALS patients, consistent with an epigenetic contribution to disease. These findings may be exploited to develop blood-based biomarkers of ALS and develop further insight into disease pathogenesis. We expect that our findings will provide a useful point of reference for further large scale studies of sporadic ALS.",
