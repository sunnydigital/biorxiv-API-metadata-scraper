    "abstract": "Coccidioidomycosis (or Valley Fever) is a fungal disease with high morbidity and mortality that affects tens of thousands of people each year. This infection is caused by two sibling species, Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii, which are endemic to specific arid locales throughout the Western Hemisphere, particularly the desert southwest of the United States. Recent epidemiological and population genetic data suggest that the geographic range of coccidioidomycosis is expanding as new endemic clusters have been identified in the state of Washington, well outside of the established endemic range. The genetic mechanisms and epidemiological consequences of this expansion are unknown and require better understanding of the population structure and evolutionary history of these pathogens. Here we perform multiple phylogenetic inference and population genomics analyses of 68 new and 18 previously published genomes. The results provide evidence of substantial population structure in C. posadasii and demonstrate presence of distinct geographic clades in central and southern Arizona as well as dispersed populations in Texas, Mexico, South America and Central America. Although a smaller number of C. immitis strains were included in the analyses, some evidence of phylogeographic structure was also detected in this species, which has been historically limited to California and Baja Mexico. Bayesian analyses indicated that C. posadasii is the more ancient of the two species and that Arizona contains the most diverse subpopulations. We propose a southern Arizona-northern Mexico origin for C. posadasii and describe a pathway for dispersal and distribution out of this region.",

    "abstract": "Despite their recognized limitations, bibliometric assessments of scientific productivity have been widely adopted. We describe here an improved method that makes novel use of the co-citation network of each article to field-normalize the number of citations it has received. The resulting Relative Citation Ratio is article-level and field-independent, and provides an alternative to the invalid practice of using Journal Impact Factors to identify influential papers. To illustrate one application of our method, we analyzed 88,835 articles published between 2003 and 2010, and found that the National Institutes of Health awardees who authored those papers occupy relatively stable positions of influence across all disciplines. We demonstrate that the values generated by this method strongly correlate with the opinions of subject matter experts in biomedical research, and suggest that the same approach should be generally applicable to articles published in all areas of science.

This ability to select actions and learn from immediate feedback is driven by the dynamics of basal ganglia (BG) pathways. A growing body of empirical evidence conflicts with the traditional view that these pathways act as independent levers for facilitating (i.e., direct pathway) or suppressing (i.e., indirect pathway) motor output, suggesting instead that they engage in a dynamic competition during action decisions that computationally captures action uncertainty. Here we discuss the utility of encoding action uncertainty as a dynamic competition between opposing control pathways and provide evidence that this simple mechanism may have powerful implications for bridging neurocomputational theories of decision making and reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "Mutation rate is a crucial evolutionary parameter that has typically been treated as a constant in population genetic analyses. However, mutation rate is likely to vary among co-existing individuals within a population, due to genetic polymorphisms, heterogeneous environmental influences, and random physiological fluctuations. We explore the consequences of such mutation rate heterogeneity in a model allowing an arbitrary distribution of mutation rate among individuals, either with or without inheritance. We find that variation of mutation rate about the mean results in a higher probability of producing zero or many simultaneous mutations on a genome. Moreover, it increases the frequency of higher order mutants even under ongoing mutation and selection. We gain a quantitative understanding of how this frequency depends on moments of the mutation rate distribution and selection coefficients. In particular, in a two-locus model, heterogeneity leads to a relative increase in double mutant frequency proportional to the squared coefficient of variation of the mutation rate. Relative effect sizes increase with the number of loci. Finally, this clustering of deleterious mutations into fewer individuals results in a higher population mean fitness. Our results imply that mutation rate heterogeneity allows a population to maintain a higher level of adaptedness to its current environment, while simultaneously harboring greater genetic diversity in the standing variation, which could be crucial for future adaptation to a new environment. Our results also have implications for interpreting mutation rate estimates and mutant frequencies in data.",

Their data convincingly show that nuclear signaling and cell volume undergo \\\"robust perfect adaptation\\\" implying integral feedback must restore their steady state values. However they incorrectly map the integrator onto a minimal network that violates assumptions implicit in conventional block diagrams. Using known features of osmotic stress signaling and results presented by the authors, I argue that glycerol concentration - the integral of the rate of glycerol accumulation (synthesis minus leakage) - transforms metabolic energy into increased osmolarity that drives water influx and restoration of turgor pressure. Integral feedback control actuated through glycerol synthesis is logically positioned to provide perfect adaptation and robustness in hyperosmotic stress responses.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has highlighted a distinction between sequential foraging choices and traditional economic choices between simultaneously presented options. This was partly motivated by observations in Kolling et al. (2012) [KBMR] that these choice types are subserved by different circuits, with dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) preferentially involved in foraging and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) preferentially involved in economic choice. To support this account, KBMR used fMRI to scan human subjects making either a foraging choice (between exploiting a current offer or swapping for potentially better rewards) or an economic choice (between two reward-probability pairs). This study found that dACC better tracked values pertaining to foraging, while vmPFC better tracked values pertaining to economic choice. We recently showed that dACCs role in these foraging choices is better described by the difficulty of choosing than by foraging value, when correcting for choice biases and testing a sufficiently broad set of foraging values (Shenhav et al., 2014). Here, we extend these findings in three ways. First, we replicate our original finding with a larger sample and a task modified to address remaining methodological gaps between our previous experiments and that of KBMR. Second, we show that dACC activity is best accounted for by choice difficulty alone (rather than in combination with foraging value) during both foraging and economic choices. Third, we show that patterns of vmPFC activity, inverted relative to dACC, also suggest a common function across both choice types. Overall, we conclude that both regions are similarly engaged by foraging-like and economic choice.",

    "abstract": "In statistical genetics an important task involves building predictive models for the genotype-phenotype relationships and thus attribute a proportion of the total phenotypic variance to the variation in genotypes. Numerous models have been proposed to incorporate additive genetic effects into models for prediction or association. However, there is a scarcity of models that can adequately account for gene by gene or other forms of genetical interactions. In addition, there is an increased interest in using marker annotations in genome-wide prediction and association. In this paper, we discuss an hybrid modeling methodology which combines the parametric mixed modeling approach and the non-parametric rule ensembles. This approach gives us a flexible class of models that can be used to capture additive, locally epistatic genetic effects, gene x background interactions and allows us to incorporate one or more annotations into the genomic selection or association models. We use benchmark data sets covering a range of organisms and traits in addition to simulated data sets to illustrate the strengths of this approach. The improvement of model accuracies and association results suggest that a part of the missing heritability\\\" in complex traits can be captured by modeling local epistasis.",

    "abstract": "When we perform a cognitive task, multiple brain regions are engaged. Understanding how these regions interact is a fundamental step to uncover the neural bases of behavior. Most research on the interactions between brain regions has focused on the univariate responses in the regions. However, fine grained patterns of response encode important information, as shown by multivariate pattern analysis. In the present article, we introduce and apply multivariate pattern connectivity (MVPC): a technique to study the dependence between brain regions in humans in terms of the multivariate relations between their patterns of responses. MVPC characterizes the responses in each brain region as trajectories in region-specific multidimensional spaces, and models the multivariate relationship between these trajectories. Considering the fusiform face area (FFA) as a seed region, we used searchlight-based MVPC to reveal interactions between regions undetected by univariate functional connectivity analyses. MVPC (but not functional connectivity) identified significant interactions between right FFA and the right anterior temporal lobe, the right superior temporal sulcus, and the dorsal visual stream. Additionally, MVPC outperformed univariate connectivity in its ability to explain independent variance in the responses of individual voxels. In the end, MVPC uncovered different connectivity profiles associated with different representational subspaces of FFA: the first principal component of FFA shows differential connectivity with occipital and parietal regions implicated in the processing of low-level properties of faces, while the second and third components show differential connectivity with anterior temporal regions implicated in the processing of invariant representations of face identity.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHuman behavior is supported by systems of brain regions that exchange infor-mation to complete a task. This exchange of information between brain regions leads to statistical relationships between their responses over time. Most likely, these relationships do not link only the mean responses in two brain regions, but also their finer spatial patterns. Analyzing finer response patterns has been a key advance in the study of responses within individual regions, and can be leveraged to study between-region interactions. To capture the overall statistical relationship between two brain regions, we need to describe each regions responses with respect to dimensions that best account for the variation in that region over time. These dimensions can be different from region to region. We introduce an approach in which each regions responses are characterized in terms of region-specific dimensions that best account for its responses, and the relationships between regions are modeled with multivariate linear models. We demonstrate that this approach provides a better account of the data as compared to standard functional connectivity, and we use it to discover multiple dimensions within the fusiform face area that have different connectivity profiles with the rest of the brain.",

Free CSN is autoinhibited, and it remains unclear how it becomes activated. We combine structural and kinetic analyses to identify mechanisms that contribute to CSN activation and Nedd8 deconjugation. Both CSN and neddylated substrate undergo large conformational changes upon binding, with important roles played by the N-terminal domains of Csn2 and Csn4 and the RING domain of Rbx1 in enabling formation of a high affinity, fully active complex. The RING domain is crucial for deneddylation, and works in part through conformational changes involving insert-2 of Csn6. Nedd8 deconjugation and re-engagement of the active site zinc by the autoinhibitory Csn5 glutamate-104 diminish affinity for Cul1/Rbx1 by ~100-fold, resulting in its rapid ejection from the active site. Together, these mechanisms enable a dynamic deneddylation-disassembly cycle that promotes rapid remodeling of the cellular CRL network.",

    "abstract": "The ability to introspectively evaluate our experiences to form accurate metacognitive beliefs, or insight, is an essential component of decision-making. Previous research suggests individuals vary substantially in their level of insight, and that this variation predicts brain volume and function, particularly in the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC). However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these effects are unclear, as qualitative, macroscopic measures such as brain volume can be related to a variety of microstructural features. Here we used a newly developed, high-resolution (800{micro}m isotropic) multi-parameter mapping technique in 48 healthy individuals to delineate quantitative markers of in vivo histological features underlying metacognitive ability. Specifically, we examined how neuroimaging markers of local grey matter myelination, macromolecular and iron content relate to insight. Extending previous volumetric findings, we found that metacognitive ability, as determined by a signal-detection theoretic model, was positively related to the myelo-architectural integrity of aPFC grey matter. Interestingly, perceptual metacognition predicted decreased macromolecule content coupled with increased iron in the hippocampus and precuneus, areas previously implicated in meta-memory rather than meta-perception. Further, the relationship of hippocampal-precuneus and prefrontal microstructure to an auditory memory measure was respectively mediated or suppressed by metacognitive ability, suggesting a dynamic trade-off between participants memory and metacognition. These results point towards a novel understanding of the relationship between memory, brain microstructure, and metacognition.\\n\\nSignificance StatementBy combining a signal-theoretic model of individual metacognitive ability with state of the art quantitative neuroimaging, our results shed new light on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying introspective insight. Myelination and iron are core determinants of both healthy brain maturation and neurodegeneration; particularly in the hippocampus where iron accumulation is linked to oxidative stress and inflammation. Our results may thus indicate that metacognition depends upon the development and integrity of a memory-related brain network, potentially revealing novel biomarkers of neurodegeneration. These results highlight the power of quantitative mapping to reveal neurobiological correlates of behaviour.",

Here we show that rhesus macaques are susceptible to infection by an Asian-lineage virus closely related to strains currently circulating in the Americas. Following subcutaneous inoculation, Zika virus RNA was detected in plasma one day post-infection (dpi) in all animals (N = 8, including 2 animals infected during the first trimester of pregnancy). Plasma viral loads peaked above 1 x 105 viral RNA copies/mL in seven of eight animals. Viral RNA was also present in saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), consistent with case reports from infected humans. Viral RNA was cleared from plasma and urine by 21 dpi in non-pregnant animals. In contrast, both pregnant animals remained viremic longer, up to 57 days. In all animals, infection was associated with transient increases in proliferating natural killer cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and plasmablasts. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in all animals by 21 dpi. Rechallenge of three non-pregnant animals with the Asian-lineage Zika virus 10 weeks after the initial challenge resulted in no detectable virus replication, suggesting that primary Zika virus infection elicits protective immunity against homologous virus strains. These data establish that Asian-lineage Zika virus infection of rhesus macaques provides a relevant animal model for studying pathogenesis in pregnant and non-pregnant individuals and evaluating potential interventions against human infection, including during pregnancy.",

And we finally investigated mitochondrial morphology and function with electron microscopy of cryo-fixed samples and by high-resolution respirometry, respectively. In addition we compared the energy metabolism of the stem cells to those of the osteosarcoma cell line MG-63.\\n\\nThe data show, for the first time, the applicability on stem cells of the methods used here. Furthermore, our results indicated that there are no obvious differences detectable in mitochondrial morphology between cells from osteoporotic and non osteoporotic donors and that these cells also seem to be energetically indistinguishable with unchanged rates of routine respiration and respiratory capacity as well as unaltered oxygen consumption rates linked to different respiratory complexes. In summary, we could not detect any evidence indicating major changes of mitochondrial features in cells from osteoporotic patients.",

Wolbachia-host interactions are many-faceted and include, but are not limited to reproductive manipulations (Werren et al. 2008), nutritional mutualism (Nikoh et al. 2014), and protection from pathogens (Hedges et al. 2008, Teixeira et al. 2008). Although there is just a single Wolbachia species described, the genus is highly diverse with regard to its distribution, phenotypes induced in the host, and genomic architecture. The generally accepted classification scheme currently in use differentiates among genetically distinct, monophyletic lineages named \\\"supergroups\\\" (Lindsey et al. 2016). To date, 16 of th ...",

    "abstract": "Summary / AbstractCodon usage patterns of viruses reflect a series of evolutionary changes that enable viruses to shape their survival rates and fitness toward the external environment and, most importantly, their hosts. In the present study, we employed multiple codon usage analysis indices to determine genotype specific codon usage patterns of Zika virus (ZIKV) strains from the current outbreak and those reported previously. Several genotype specific and common codon usage traits were noted in ZIKV coding sequences, indicative of independent evolutionary origins from a common ancestor. The overall influence of natural selection was found to be more profound than that of mutation pressure and acting on specific set of viral genes belonging to ZIKV strains of Asian genotype from the recent outbreak. Furthermore, an interplay of codon adaptation and deoptimization have been observed in ZIKV genomes. The collective findings of codon analysis in association with the geographical data of Aedes populations in the Americas suggests that ZIKV have evolved a dynamic set of codon usage patterns in order to maintain a successful replication and transmission chain within multiple hosts and vectors.",
