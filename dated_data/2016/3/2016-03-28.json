    "abstract": "Many complex brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, exhibit a wide range of symptoms and disability. To understand how brain communication is impaired in such conditions, functional connectivity studies seek to understand individual differences in brain network structure in terms of covariates that measure symptom severity. In practice, however, functional connectivity is not observed but estimated from complex and noisy neural activity measurements. Imperfect subject network estimates can compromise subsequent efforts to detect covariate effects on network structure. We address this problem in the case of Gaussian graphical models of functional connectivity, by proposing novel two-level models that treat both subject level networks and population level covariate effects as unknown parameters. To account for imperfectly estimated subject level networks when fitting these models, we propose two related approaches -- R2 based on resampling and random effects test statistics, and R3 that additionally employs random adaptive penalization. Simulation studies using realistic graph structures reveal that R2 and R3 have superior statistical power to detect covariate effects compared to existing approaches, particularly when the number of within subject observations is comparable to the size of subject networks. Using our novel models and methods to study parts of the ABIDE dataset, we find evidence of hypoconnectivity associated with symptom severity in autism spectrum disorders, in frontoparietal and limbic systems as well as in anterior and posterior cingulate cortices.",

    "abstract": "Computational workflows and pipelines are often created to automate series of processing steps. For instance, workflows enable one to standardize analysis for large projects or core facilities, but are also useful for individual biologists who need to perform repetitive data processing. Some workflow systems, designed for beginners, offer a graphical user interface and have been very popular with biologists. In practice, these tools are infrequently used by more experienced bioinformaticians, who may require more flexibility or performance than afforded by the user interfaces, and seem to prefer developing workflows with scripting or command line tools. Here, we present a workflow system, the NextflowWorkbench, which was designed for both beginners and experts, and blends the distinction between user interface and scripting language. This system extends and reuses the popular Nextflow workflow description language and shares its advantages. In contrast to Nextflow, NextflowWorkbench offers an integrated development environment that helps complete beginners get started with workflow development. Auto-completion helps beginners who do not know the syntax of the Nextflow language. Reusable processes provide modular workflows. Programmers will benefit from unique interactive features that help users work more productively with docker containers. We illustrate this tool with a workflow to estimate RNA-Seq counts using Kallisto. The workflow can transparently run either on a laptop computer with docker or on a linux cluster. We found that beginners can be taught how to assemble this workflow in a two hours training session. In conclusion, the NextflowWorkbench simplifies the development of reproducible, implicitly parallel workflows.

    "abstract": "Phase-amplitude coupling between theta and multiple gamma sub-bands hallmarks hippocampal activity and is believed to take part in information routing. More recently, theta and gamma oscillations were also reported to exhibit reliable phase-phase coupling, or n:m phase-locking. The existence of n:m phase-locking suggests an important mechanism of neuronal coding that has long received theoretical support. However, here we show that n:m phase-locking (1) is much lower than previously reported, (2) highly depends on epoch length, (3) does not statistically differ from chance (when employing proper surrogate methods), and that (4) filtered white noise has similar n:m scores as actual data. Moreover, (5) the diagonal stripes in theta-gamma phase-phase histograms of actual data can be explained by theta harmonics. These results point to lack of theta-gamma phase-phase coupling in the hippocampus, and suggest that studies investigating n:m phase-locking should rely on appropriate statistical controls, otherwise they could easily fall into analysis pitfalls.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule studies of protein-nucleic acid interactions frequently require site-specific modification of long DNA substrates. DNA isolated from bacteriophage {lambda} ({lambda}-DNA) is a convenient source of high quality long (48.5 kb) DNA. However, introducing specific DNA sequences, tertiary structures, and chemical modifications into {lambda}-DNA remains technically challenging. Most current approaches rely on multi-step ligations with low yields and incomplete products. Here, we describe a molecular toolkit for rapid preparation of modified {lambda}-DNA. A set of PCR cassettes facilitates the introduction of recombinant DNA sequences into {lambda}-DNA with 90-100% yield. Furthermore, various DNA structures and chemical modifications can be inserted at user-defined sites via an improved nicking enzyme-based strategy. As a proof-of-principle, we explore the interactions of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) with modified DNA sequences and structures incorporated within {lambda}-DNA. Our results demonstrate that PCNA can load on both 5-ssDNA flaps and a 13xCAG triplet repeat. However, PCNA remains trapped on the 13xCAG structure, confirming a proposed mechanism for triplet repeat expansion. Although we focus on {lambda}-DNA, this method is applicable to all long DNA substrates. We anticipate that this molecular toolbox will be broadly useful for both ensemble- and single-molecule studies that require site-specific modification of long DNA substrates.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to survey optical and biochemical variation in cell populations deposited onto a surface through touch or contact and identify specific features that may be used to differentially label and then sort cell populations from separate contributors in a trace biological mixture. Cell characterizations initially focused on two different protein systems, Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) complex and cytokeratin (CK) filaments. Hybridization experiments using pan and allele-specific HLA antibody probes showed that surface antigens on cells transferred from the palmar surface of volunteers are largely unreactive, suggesting that they cannot be used to differentiate cell populations in a touch mixture. Touch samples were also hybridized with the pan-CK probe AE1, which targets CK proteins 10, 14, 15, 16 and 19. Fluorescence levels of AE1 hybridized cells were observed to vary across donors, although these differences were not consistent across all sampling days. We then investigated variations in red autofluorescence profiles (650-670nm) as a potential signature for distinguishing contributor cell populations. Although distinct differences in red autofluorescence profiles were observed -- with one donor consistently exhibiting higher levels of fluorescence than others -- some variation was also observed in touch samples collected from the same individual on different days. While this suggests that contributor touch samples cannot be defined by a discrete level of autofluorescence, this attribute may still be a useful means of isolating contributors to some touch mixtures. To test whether these observed optical differences could potentially be used as the basis for a cell separation workflow, a controlled two person touch mixture was separated into two fractions via Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) using gating criteria based on intensity of 650-670nm emissions, and then subjected to DNA analysis. STR typing of the sorted fractions provided partial profiles that were consistent with separation of individual contributors from the mixture.",

    "abstract": "Cell adhesion molecules are key to axon guidance during development, for example specific cues can instruct axons to terminate in a specific area, or to continue growth. Syndecans are conserved cell-surface receptors that function in multiple developmental contexts. Caenorhabditis elegans with mutations in the single syndecan gene, sdn-1, exhibited errors in anterior-posterior guidance, with axons that stopped short of, or grew past their stereotypical termination point. Syndecan function was cell non-autonomous for GABAergic axon outgrowth during early development, but was likely cell autonomous to inhibit growth later in development. sdn-1 appeared to regulate the inhibitory activity of the egl-20/Wnt ligand. Removing egl-20 from sdn-1 mutants resulted in fewer animals with prematurely terminating axons. The proteoglycan modifying enzymes hse-5 and hst-2, but not hst-6, had similar effects, suggesting specific heparan sulfate modifications regulated EGL-20 axon-terminating activity. sdn-1 functioned with lin-17/Frizzled, bar-1/{beta}-catenin and the egl-5 Hox-like transcription factor in EGL-20-depedent axon outgrowth. bar-1 was required for egl-5 expression in the most posterior GABAergic neurons. sdn-1 mutations did not eliminate egl-5 expression, but over-expression of egl-5 rescued sdn-1 phenotypes. Our results suggest syndecan is a component of Wnt-signaling events that are necessary for axons to recognize appropriate termination points.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere has been considerable interest and progress in our perception of organized complexity in recent years. Recurrent debates on the dynamics and stability of complex systems have enriched our understanding of these systems, but generalities in the relationship between structure and dynamics are hard to come by. Although traditionally an arena for theoreticians, much of this research has been invigorated by demonstration of the existence of alternate stable equilibria in real world ecosystems such as lakes, coral reefs, forests and grasslands.\\n\\nResultsLinking up systems thinking with recent advances in our understanding of ecological networks opens up exciting possibilities. In an attempt to obtain general patterns of behaviour of complex systems, we have analyzed the response of eighty-six real world ecological networks to targeted extinctions, and the findings suggest that most networks are robust to loss of specialists until specific thresholds are reached in terms of geodesics. If the extinctions persist, a state change or  flip occurs and the structural properties are altered drastically, although the network does not collapse. Further, we find that as opposed to simpler networks, larger networks have several such alternate states that ensure their long-term persistence and that indeed complexity does endow resilience to such networks.\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first report of critical transitions in ecological networks and the implications of these findings for complex systems characterized by networks are likely to be profound with immediate significance in conservation biology, invasion biology and restoration ecology.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders entailing social and cognitive deficits, including marked problems with language. Numerous genes have been associated with ASD, but it is unclear how language deficits arise from gene mutation or dysregulation. It is also unclear why ASD shows such high prevalence within human populations. Interestingly, the emergence of a modern faculty of language has been hypothesised to be linked to changes in the human brain/skull, but also to the process of self-domestication of the human species. It is our intention to show that people with ASD exhibit less marked domesticated traits at the morphological, physiological, and behavioural levels. We also discuss many ASD candidates represented among the genes known to be involved in the domestication syndrome (the constellation of traits exhibited by domesticated mammals, which seemingly results from the hypofunction of the neural crest) and among the set of genes involved in language function closely connected to them. Moreover, many of these genes show altered expression profiles in the brain of autists. In addition, some candidates for domestication and language-readiness show the same expression profile in people with ASD and chimps in different brain areas involved in language processing. Similarities regarding the brain oscillatory behaviour of these areas can be expected too. We conclude that ASD may represent an abnormal ontogenetic itinerary for the human faculty of language resulting in part from changes in genes important for the domestication syndrome and, ultimately, from the normal functioning of the neural crest.",

    "abstract": "The dense-core vesicle is a secretory organelle that mediates the regulated release of peptide hormones, growth factors, and biogenic amines. Dense-core vesicles originate from the trans-Golgi of neurons and neuroendocrine cells, but it is unclear how this specialized organelle is formed and acquires its specific cargos. To identify proteins that act in dense-core vesicle biogenesis, we performed a forward genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans for mutants defective in dense-core vesicle function. We previously reported the identification of two conserved proteins that interact with the small GTPase RAB-2 to control normal dense-core vesicle cargo-sorting. Here we identify several additional conserved factors important for dense-core vesicle cargo sorting: the WD40 domain protein EIPR-1 and the endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) complex. By assaying behavior and the trafficking of dense-core vesicle cargos, we show that mutants that lack EIPR-1 or EARP have defects in dense-core vesicle cargo-sorting similar to those of mutants in the RAB-2 pathway. Genetic epistasis data indicate that RAB-2, EIPR-1 and EARP function in a common pathway. In addition, using a proteomic approach in rat insulinoma cells, we show that EIPR-1 physically interacts with the EARP complex. Our data suggest that EIPR-1 is a new component of the EARP complex and that dense-core vesicle cargo sorting depends on the EARP-dependent retrieval of cargo from an endosomal sorting compartment.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAnimal cells package and store many important signaling molecules in specialized compartments called dense-core vesicles. Molecules stored in dense-core vesicles include peptide hormones like insulin and small molecule neurotransmitters like dopamine. Defects in the release of these compounds can lead to a wide range of metabolic and mental disorders in humans, including diabetes, depression, and drug addiction. However, it is not well understood how dense-core vesicles are formed in cells and package the appropriate molecules. Here we use a genetic screen in the microscopic worm C. elegans to identify proteins that are important for early steps in the generation of dense-core vesicles, such as packaging the correct molecular cargos in the vesicles. We identify several factors that are conserved between worms and humans and point to a new role for a protein complex that had previously been shown to be important for controlling trafficking in other cellular compartments. The identification of this complex suggests new cellular trafficking events that may be important for the generation of dense-core vesicles.",
