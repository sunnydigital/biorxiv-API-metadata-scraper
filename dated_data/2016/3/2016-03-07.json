    "abstract": "Gene duplication was proposed by S.Ohno (1) as a key mechanism of a novel gene function evolution. A pair of gene paralogs, NTNG1 and NTNG2, sharing identical gene and protein structures and encoding similar proteins, forms a functional complement subfunctionalising (SF) within cognitive domains and forming cognitive endophenotypes, as detected by Intellectual Quotient (IQ) tests (2). Both NTNG paralogs are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ), with unique nonoverlapping segregation among the other 15 cognitive disorders (CD), emphasizing an evolutionary gain-dependent link between advanced cognitive functions and concomitant neurocognitive pathologies. Complementary expression and human brain transcriptome composition of the paralogs explains the observed phenomena of their functional complementarity. The lowest identity among NTNGs is found in a middle of encoded by them proteins designated as uknown (Ukd) domain. NTNG1 contains anthropoid-specific constrained regions, and both genes contain non-coding conserved sequences underwent accelerated evolution in human. NTNG paralogs SF perturbates \\\"structure drives function\\\" concept at protein and gene levels. The paralogs function diversification forms a so-called \\\"Cognitive Complement (CC)\\\", a product of gene duplication and subsequent cognitive subfunction bifurcation among the NTNG gene duplicates.",

    "abstract": "Herbivore induced defences are robust, evolve rapidly and activated in plants when specific elicitors, frequently found in the herbivores oral secretions (OS) are introduced into wounds during attack. How these complex induced defences evolve remains unclear. Here, we show that herbivore-induced transcriptomic responses in a wild tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata, display an evolutionary hourglass: the pattern that characterises the transcriptomic evolution of embryogenesis in animals, plants, and fungi. While relatively young and rapidly evolving genes involved in signal perception and processing to regulate defence metabolite biosynthesis are recruited both early (1 h) and late (9-21 h) in the defence elicitation process, a group of highly conserved and older genes involved in transcriptomic regulation are activated in the middle stage (5 h). The appearance of the evolutionary hourglass architecture in both developmental and defence elicitation processes may reflect the importance of robustness and evolvability in the signalling of these important biological processes.",

    "abstract": "A pair of vertebrate-specific and brain-expressed pre-synaptic genes, NTNG1 and NTNG2, contributes to the Intellectual Quotient (IQ) test scores in a complementary manner. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NTNG1 are associated with attenuated verbal comprehension (VC) or processing speed (PS) while NTNG2 SNPs affect working memory (WM) and perceptual organization (PO), forming cognitive endophenotypes in healthy and schizophrenia (SCZ)-affected human subjects. Regions of interest (ROIs), defined as 21 nucleotide (nu) long NTNG gene loci symmetrically embedding the IQ-affecting mutation alleles (VC/PS and WM/PO), underwent dramatic evolutionary changes from mice through primates to hominins, at the accelerated rates. Mutation alleles associated with the higher VC and WM IQ scores are found in the genomes of extinct hominins of Neolithic times, however, lower WM scores associated allele is also detectable in Mesolithic hunters genomes. Protein sequence of NTNG1 is 100% conserved among the primates, archaic and modern extinct hominins while NTNG2 underwent a recent selection sweep encoding a primate-specific S371A/V (~50,000 yrs BC), and a modern human (5,300 yrs BC) T346A substitutions. We show that a 500 mln yrs old genomic duplication of a synapse primordial gene provided a substrate for further synapse elaborations and its ultimate capacitive expansion of what evolved into a vertebrate cognitive superior complexity - intelligence.",

By contrast, here we report continuous variation in the induced frequency of cells with slow osmotic stress signaling, survival and proliferation among 50 ecologically-distinct strains of budding yeast challenged by sudden hyperosmotic stress. Despite extensive variation in early mortality, strains displayed robust perfect adaptation and recovery of steady-state viability in moderate stress. In severe stress survival depended on strain-specific proportions of cells with divergent strategies.  Cautious cells survived without dividing;  reckless cells attempted to divide too soon and failed, killing both mother and daughter. We show that heritable frequencies of cautious and reckless cells produce a rapidly diversifying template for microbial bet hedging that mimics natural variation in stress responses whose timing, amplitude and frequency could evolve - be  tuned by - different patterns of environmental stress.",

    "abstract": "Since being introduced into Brazil in 2014, Zika virus (ZIKV) has spread explosively across Central and South America. Although the symptoms of ZIKV are generally mild, recent evidence suggests a relationship between prenatal exposure to ZIKV and microcephaly. This has led to widespread panic, including travel alerts and warnings to avoid pregnancy. Because ZIKV is an emerging disease, response efforts are complicated by limited understanding of disease dynamics. To this end, we develop a novel state- and class-structured compartment model for ZIKV. Our model shows that the risk of prenatal ZIKV exposure should decrease dramatically following the initial wave of disease, reaching almost undetectable levels in endemic systems. Our model also suggests that, depending on ZIVK transmission levels in the Americas, efforts to reduce ZIKV prenatal exposures through mosquito management and avoidance may have minimal benefit, and may even result in increased risk of microcephaly in later years of an outbreak.",

Earlier studies have reported diurnal variations of IL-6, but phase estimates are conflicting. We have therefore performed a meta-analysis on the diurnal variation of circulating IL-6. Studies were included if they reported circulating levels of IL-6 recorded at least twice within 24 hours in the same individual. A systematic search resulted in the inclusion of 43 studies with 56 datasets, for a total of 1100 participants. Individual participant data were available from 4 datasets with a total of 56 participants. Mixed-effects meta-regression modelling confirmed that IL-6 varied across the day, the most conspicuous effect being a trough in the morning. These results stand in contrast to earlier findings of a peak in the evening or night, and suggest that diurnal variation should be taken into account in order to avoid confounding in studies of IL-6 in plasma or serum.",

    "abstract": "Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism of communication used by bacteria to monitor cell density and coordinate cooperative behaviors. An emerging framework is that the adaptive significance of QS in regulation of production of costly extracellular metabolites (public goods) is to maintain the homeostasis of cooperation. We investigated the functionality of QS-dependent regulation of rhamnolipids, extracellular surface-active glycolipids promoting the social swarming motility behavior, in Burkholderia glumae and found that QS is superfluous under rich nutritional conditions. In contrast, decreasing nutrient concentrations to reduce the growth rate amplifies rhamnolipid biosynthesis gene expression, revealing a system where QS-dependent regulation is triggered by the growth rate of the population rather than by its cell density. Our results provide evidence that the adaptive significance of QS in regulation of public goods is to maintain an optimized demand-driven supply of target cooperative behavior, wherein efficiency can be traded off against survival.",

The composition of PHA produced by these clones was dependent on both the supplied growth substrates and the nature of the PHA synthase, with various combinations of SCL-and MCL-PHA.

    "abstract": "The human genome encodes 45 kinesins that drive cell division, cell motility, intracellular trafficking, and ciliary function. Determining the cellular function of each kinesin would be greatly facilitated by specific small molecule inhibitors, but screens have yielded inhibitors that are specific to only a small number of kinesins, likely due to the high conservation of the kinesin motor domain across the superfamily. Here we present a chemical-genetic approach to engineer kinesin motors that retain microtubule-dependent motility in the absence of inhibitor yet can be efficiently inhibited by small, cell-permeable molecules. Using kinesin-1 as a prototype, we tested two independent strategies to design inhibitable motors. First, we inserted the six amino acid tetracysteine tag into surface loops of the motor domain such that binding of biarsenic dyes allosterically inhibits processive motility. Second, we fused DmrB dimerization domains to the motor heads such that addition of B/B homodimerizer cross-links the two motor domains and inhibits motor stepping. We show, using cellular assays that the engineered kinesin-1 motors are able to transport artificial and natural kinesin-1 cargoes, but are efficiently inhibited by the addition of the relevant small molecule. Single-molecule imaging in vitro revealed that inhibitor addition reduces the number of processively moving motors on the microtubule, with minor effects on motor run length and velocity. It is likely that these inhibition strategies can be successfully applied to other members of the kinesin superfamily due to the high conservation of the kinesin motor domain. The described engineered motors will be of great utility to dynamically and specifically study kinesin function in cells and animals.",

    "abstract": "Interpretive analysis of metagenomic data depends on an understanding of the underlying associations among microbes from metagenomic samples. Although several statistical tools have been developed for metage-nomic association studies, they suffer from compositional bias or fail to take into account environmental factors that directly affect the composition of a given microbial community. In this paper, we propose metagenomic Lognormal-Dirichlet-Multinomial (mLDM), a hierarchical Bayesian model with sparsity constraints to bypass compositional bias and discover new associations among microbes and between microbes and environmental factors. The mLD-M model can 1) infer both conditionally dependent associations among microbes and direct associations between microbes and environmental factors; 2) consider both compositional bias and variance of metagenomic data; and 3) estimate absolute abundance for microbes. Thus, conditionally dependent association can capture direct relationship underlying microbial pairs and remove the indirect connections induced from other common factors. Empirical studies show the effectiveness of the mLDM model, using both synthetic data and the TARA Oceans eukaryotic data by comparing it with several state-of-the-art methodologies. Finally, mLDM is applied to western English Channel data and finds some interesting associations.",

    "abstract": "Forward Wright-Fisher simulations are powerful in their ability to model complex demography and selection scenarios, but suffer from slow execution on the CPU, thus limiting their usefulness. The single-locus Wright-Fisher forward algorithm is, however, exceedingly parallelizable, with many steps which are so-called embarrassingly parallel, consisting of a vast number of individual computations that are all independent of each other and thus capable of being performed concurrently. The rise of modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and programming languages designed to leverage the inherent parallel nature of these processors have allowed researchers to dramatically speed up many programs that have such high arithmetic intensity and intrinsic concurrency. The presented GPU Optimized Wright-Fisher simulation, or GO Fish for short, can be used to simulate arbitrary selection and demographic scenarios while running over 250-fold faster than its serial counterpart on the CPU. Even modest GPU hardware can achieve an impressive speedup of well over two orders of magnitude. With simulations so accelerated, one can not only do quick parametric bootstrapping of previously estimated parameters, but also use simulated results to calculate the likelihoods and summary statistics of demographic and selection models against real polymorphism data - all without restricting the demographic and selection scenarios that can be modeled or requiring approximations to the single-locus forward algorithm for efficiency. Further, as many of the parallel programming techniques used in this simulation can be applied to other computationally intensive algorithms important in population genetics, GO Fish serves as an exciting template for future research into accelerating computation in evolution. GO Fish is part of the Parallel PopGen Package available at: http://dl42.github.io/ParallelPopGen/",

Cause of stranding remains unknown but the whale (QE22.09.2007) showed no severe traumatic injuries nor was emaciated. Based on at least seven morphological features, considered diagnostic in combination, allowed a positive identification as Omuras whale Balaenoptera omurai. Features included diminutive body size (397 cm), a large number of ventral grooves (n=82) extending caudad of the umbilicus, a strongly falcate dorsal fin, asymmetric colouration of the head (especially lower jaws) reminiscent of fin whale, including three unilateral dark stripes, faint/incomplete lateral rostral ridges, record low number of short, broad baleen plates (204 in right jaw). The likelihood for the existence of a local B. omurai population in the eastern Persian Gulf or northern Arabian Sea seems higher than the wandering of a very young animal or mother/calf pair from any of the known distant distribution areas in the eastern Indian Ocean or SW Indian Ocean (Madagascar). This is the first record of B. omurai in the NW Indian Ocean.",

    "abstract": "The relatively narrow range of genetic polymorphism levels across species has been a major source of debate since the inception of molecular population genetics. Recently Corbett-Detig et al found evidence that linked selection strongly constrains levels of polymorphism in species with large census sizes. Here I reexamine this claim and find weak support for this conclusion. While linked selection is an important determinant of polymorphism levels along the genome in many species, we currently lack compelling evidence that it is a major determinant of polymorphism levels among obligately sexual species.",

    "abstract": "The processes whereby ecological networks emerge, persist and decay throughout ecosystem development are largely unknown. Here we study networks of plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities along a 120,000 yr soil chronosequence, as they undergo assembly (progression) and then disassembly (retrogression). We found that network assembly and disassembly were symmetrical, self-reinforcing processes that together were capable of generating key attributes of network architecture. Plant and AMF species that had short indirect paths to others in the community (i.e. high centrality), rather than many direct interaction partners (i.e. high degree), were best able to attract new interaction partners and in the case of AMF species, also to retain existing interactions with plants during retrogression. We then show using simulations that these non-random patterns of attachment and detachment promote nestedness of the network. These results have implications for predicting extinction sequences, identifying focal points for invasions, and suggesting trajectories for restoration.",
