    "abstract": "With the increasing availability of functional genomic data,1-3 incorporating genomic annotations into genetic association analysis has become a standard procedure. However, the existing methods often lack rigor and/or computational efficiency and consequently do not maximize the utility of functional annotations. In this paper, we propose a rigorous inference procedure to perform integrative association analysis incorporating genomic annotations for both traditional GWAS and emerging molecular QTL mapping studies. In particular, we propose an algorithm, named \\\"Deterministic Approximation of Posteriors\\\" (DAP), which enables highly efficient and accurate joint enrichment analysis and identification of multiple causal variants. We use a series of simulation studies to highlight the power and computational efficiency of our proposed approach and further demonstrate it by analyzing the cross-population eQTL data from the GEUVADIS project and the multi-tissue eQTL data from the GTEx project. In particular, we find that genetic variants predicted to disrupt transcription factor binding sites are enriched in cis-eQTLs across all tissues. Moreover, the enrichment estimates obtained across the tissues are correlated with the cell types for which the annotations are derived.",

    "abstract": "To examine the role of natural selection on fecundity in a variety of Caenorhabditis elegans genetic backgrounds, we used an experimental evolution protocol to evolve 14 distinct genetic strains over 15-20 generations. Beginning with three founder worms for each strain, we were able to generate 790 distinct genealogies, which provided information on both the effects of natural selection and the evolvability of each strain. Among these genotypes are a wildtype (N2) and a collection of mutants with targeted mutations in the daf-c, daf-d, and AMPK pathways. The overarching goal of our analysis is two-fold: to observe differences in reproductive fitness and observe related changes in reproductive timing. This yields two outcomes. The first is that the majority of selective effects on fecundity occur during the first few generations of evolution, while the negative selection for reproductive timing occurs on longer timescales. The second finding reveals that positive selection on fecundity results in positive and negative selection on reproductive timing, both of which are strain-dependent. Using a derivative of population size per generation called the reproductive carry-over (RCO) measure, it is found that the fluctuation and shape of the probability distribution may be informative in terms of developmental selection. While these consist of general patterns that transcend mutations in a specific gene, changes in the RCO measure may nevertheless be products of selection. In conclusion, we discuss the broader implications of these findings, particularly in the context of genotype-fitness maps and the role of uncharacterized mutations in individual variation and evolvability.",

    "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is caused by deletion or mutation of the Survival Motor Neuron 1 gene (SMN1), but the mechanism whereby reduced levels of SMN protein lead to disease is unknown. SMN functions in the assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and potential splicing defects have been uncovered in various animal models of SMA. We used disruptions in Smn and two additional snRNP biogenesis genes, Phax and Ars2, to classify RNA processing differences as snRNP-dependent or Smn gene specific. Although more numerous, the processing changes in Ars2 mutants were mostly distinct from those identified in Phax and Smn animals. Phax and Smn null mutants exhibited comparable reductions in steady-state snRNA levels, and direct comparison of their transcriptomic profiles uncovered a shared set of alternative splicing changes. However, these RNA processing differences were largely absent in three different models of intermediate SMA. Instead, the three hypomorphic Smn point mutants displayed an activation of stress responsive transcripts that correlated with phenotypic severity. In summary, genome-wide analyses showed that mRNA expression and alternative splicing defects are not conserved between hypomorphic and complete loss-of-function Smn mutants. Because disease phenotypes are unlikely to result from global changes in RNA processing, additional hypotheses for the etiology of SMA should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Despite their small size, insect brains are able to produce robust and efficient navigation in complex environments. Specifically in social insects, such as ants and bees, these navigational capabilities are guided by orientation directing vectors generated by a process called path integration. During this process, they integrate compass and odometric cues to estimate their current location as a vector, called home vector for guiding them back home on a straight path. They further acquire and retrieve path integration-based vector memories anchored globally to the nest or visual landmarks. Although existing computational models reproduced similar behaviors, they largely neglected evidence for possible neural substrates underlying the generated behavior. Therefore, we present here a model of neural mechanisms in a modular closed-loop control - enabling vector navigation in embodied agents. The model consists of a path integration mechanism, reward-modulated global and local vector learning, random search, and action selection. The path integration mechanism integrates compass and odometric cues to compute a vectorial representation of the agents current location as neural activity patterns in circular arrays. A reward-modulated learning rule enables the acquisition of vector memories by associating the local food reward with the path integration state. A motor output is computed based on the combination of vector memories and random exploration. In sim-ulation, we show that the neural mechanisms enable robust homing and localization, even in the presence of external sensory noise. The proposed learning rules lead to goal-directed navigation and route formation performed under realistic conditions. This provides an explanation for, how view-based navigational strategies are guided by path integration. Consequently, we provide a novel approach for vector learning and navigation in a simulated embodied agent linking behavioral observations to their possible underlying neural substrates.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDesert ants survive under harsh conditions by foraging for food in temperatures over 60{degrees} C. In this extreme environment, they cannot, like other ants, use pheromones to track their long-distance journeys back to their nests. Instead they apply a computation called path integration, which involves integrating skylight compass and odometric stimuli to estimate its current position. Path integration is not only used to return safely to their nests, but also helps in learning so-called vector memories. Such memories are sufficient to produce goal-directed and landmark-guided navigation in social insects. How can small insect brains generate such complex behaviors? Computational models are often useful for studying behavior and their underlying control mechanisms. Here we present a novel computational framework for the acquisition and expression of vector memories based on path integration. It consists of multiple neural networks and a reward-based learning rule, where vectors are represented by the activity patterns of circular arrays. Our model not only reproduces goal-directed navigation and route formation in a simulated agent, but also offers predictions about neural implementations. Taken together, we believe that it demonstrates the first complete model of vector-guided navigation linking observed behaviors of navigating social insects to their possible underlying neural mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Proteins localized to mitochondria by a carboxyl-terminal tail anchor (TA) play roles in apoptosis, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial protein import. To reveal characteristics of TAs that may be important for mitochondrial targeting, we focused our attention upon the TA of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fis1 protein. Specifically, we generated a library of Fis1p TA variants fused to the Gal4 transcription factor, then, using next-generation sequencing, revealed which Fis1p TA mutations inhibited membrane insertion and allowed Gal4p activity in the nucleus. Prompted by our global analysis, we subsequently analyzed the ability of individual Fis1p TA mutants to localize to mitochondria. Our findings suggest that the membrane-associated domain of Fis1p TA may be bipartite in nature, and we encountered evidence that the positively charged patch at the carboxyl-terminus of Fis1p is required for both membrane insertion and organelle specificity. Furthermore, lengthening or shortening the Fis1 TA by up to three amino acids did not inhibit mitochondrial targeting, arguing against a model in which TA length directs insertion of TAs at specific organelles. Most importantly, positively charged residues were more acceptable at several positions within the membrane-associated domain of the Fis1p TA than negatively charged residues. These findings, emerging from the first high-resolution analysis of an organelle targeting sequence by deep mutational scanning, provide strong, in vivo evidence that lysine and arginine can \\\"snorkel,\\\" or become stably incorporated within a lipid bilayer by placing terminal charges of their side chains at the membrane interface.\\n\\nAbbreviations",
