    "abstract": "Reciprocal coevolving interactions between hosts and parasites are a primary source of strong selection that can promote rapid and often population- or genotype-specific evolutionary change. These host-parasite interactions are also a major source of disease. Despite their importance, very little is known about the genomic basis of coevolving host-parasite interactions in natural populations, especially in animals. Here, we use gene expression and sequence evolution approaches to take critical steps towards characterizing the genomic basis of interactions between the freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum and its coevolving sterilizing trematode parasite, Microphallus sp., a textbook example of natural coevolution. We found that Microphallus-infected P. antipodarum exhibit systematic downregulation of genes relative to uninfected P. antipodarum. The specific genes involved in parasite response differ markedly across lakes, consistent with a scenario where population-level coevolution is leading to population-specific host-parasite interactions and evolutionary trajectories. We also used an FST-based approach to identify a set of loci that represent promising candidates for targets of parasite-mediated selection across lakes as well as within each lake population. These results constitute the first genomic evidence for population-specific responses to coevolving infection in the P. antipodarum-Microphallus interaction and provide new insights into the genomic basis of coevolutionary interactions in nature.",

    "abstract": "Despite their small size, insect brains are able to produce robust and efficient navigation in complex environments. Specifically in social insects, such as ants and bees, these navigational capabilities are guided by orientation directing vectors generated by a process called path integration. During this process, they integrate compass and odometric cues to estimate their current location as a vector, called home vector for guiding them back home on a straight path. They further acquire and retrieve path integration-based vector memories anchored globally to the nest or visual landmarks. Although existing computational models reproduced similar behaviors, they largely neglected evidence for possible neural substrates underlying the generated behavior. Therefore, we present here a model of neural mechanisms in a modular closed-loop control - enabling vector navigation in embodied agents. The model consists of a path integration mechanism, reward-modulated global and local vector learning, random search, and action selection. The path integration mechanism integrates compass and odometric cues to compute a vectorial representation of the agents current location as neural activity patterns in circular arrays. A reward-modulated learning rule enables the acquisition of vector memories by associating the local food reward with the path integration state. A motor output is computed based on the combination of vector memories and random exploration. In sim-ulation, we show that the neural mechanisms enable robust homing and localization, even in the presence of external sensory noise. The proposed learning rules lead to goal-directed navigation and route formation performed under realistic conditions. This provides an explanation for, how view-based navigational strategies are guided by path integration. Consequently, we provide a novel approach for vector learning and navigation in a simulated embodied agent linking behavioral observations to their possible underlying neural substrates.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDesert ants survive under harsh conditions by foraging for food in temperatures over 60{degrees} C. In this extreme environment, they cannot, like other ants, use pheromones to track their long-distance journeys back to their nests. Instead they apply a computation called path integration, which involves integrating skylight compass and odometric stimuli to estimate its current position. Path integration is not only used to return safely to their nests, but also helps in learning so-called vector memories. Such memories are sufficient to produce goal-directed and landmark-guided navigation in social insects. How can small insect brains generate such complex behaviors? Computational models are often useful for studying behavior and their underlying control mechanisms. Here we present a novel computational framework for the acquisition and expression of vector memories based on path integration. It consists of multiple neural networks and a reward-based learning rule, where vectors are represented by the activity patterns of circular arrays. Our model not only reproduces goal-directed navigation and route formation in a simulated agent, but also offers predictions about neural implementations. Taken together, we believe that it demonstrates the first complete model of vector-guided navigation linking observed behaviors of navigating social insects to their possible underlying neural mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "In the past ten years, many studies have shown that malignant tissue has been \\\"normalized\\\" in vitro using mechanical signals. We apply the principles of physical oncology (or mechanobiology) in vivo to show the effect of a \\\"constraint field\\\" on tumor growth. The human breast cancer cell line, MDA MB 231, admixed with ferric nanoparticles was grafted subcutaneously in Nude mice. The magnetizable particles rapidly surrounded the growing tumor. Two permanent magnets located on either side of the tumor created a gradient of magnetic field. Magnetic energy is transformed into mechanical energy by the particles acting as \\\"bioactuators\\\", applying a constraint field and, by consequence, biomechanical stress to the tumor. This biomechanical treatment was applied 2 hours/day during 21 days, from Day 18 to Day 39 following tumor implantation. The study lasted 74 days. Palpable tumor was measured two times a week. There was a significant in vivo difference between the median volume of treated tumors and untreated controls in the mice measured up to D 74 (D 59 + population): (529 [346; 966] mm3 vs 1334 [256; 2106] mm3; p=0.015), treated mice having smaller tumors. The difference was not statistically significant in the group of mice measured at least to D 59 (D 59 population). On ex vivo examination, the surface of the tumor mass, measured on histologic sections, was less in the treated group, G1, than in the control groups: G2 (nanoparticles, no magnetic field), G3 (magnetic field, no nanoparticles), G4 (no nanoparticles, no magnetic field) in the D 59 population (Median left surface was significantly lower in G1 (5.6 [3.0; 42.4] mm2, p=0.005) than in G2 (20.8 [4.9; 34.3]), G3 (16.5 [13.2; 23.2]) and G4 (14.8 [1.8; 55.5]); Median right surface was significantly lower in G1 (4.7 [1.9; 29.2] mm2, p=0.015) than in G2 (25.0 [5.2; 55.0]), G3 (18.0 [14.6; 35.2]) and G4 (12.5 [1.5; 51.8]). There was no statistically significant difference in the day 59+ population. This is the first demonstration of the effect of stress on tumor growth in vivo suggesting that biomechanical intervention may have a high translational potential as a therapy in locally advanced tumors like pancreatic cancer or primary hepatic carcinoma for which no effective therapy is currently available.",

An effective cryopreservation protocol for these cells following their isolation will make studying them more feasible.\\n\\nMethods and findingsTo find an optimal cryopreservation protocol for mucosal mononuclear leukocytes, we compared cryopreservation media and procedures using human vaginal leukocytes and confirmed our results with endocervical and colorectal leukocytes. Specifically, we measured the recovery of viable vaginal T cells and macrophages after cryopreservation with different cryopreservation media and handling procedures. We found several cryopreservation media that led to recoveries above 75%. Limiting the number and volume of washes increased the fraction of cells recovered by 10-15%, possibly due to the small cell numbers in mucosal samples. We confirmed that our cryopreservation protocol also works well for both endocervical and colorectal leukocytes.\\n\\nCryopreserved leukocytes had slightly increased cytokine responses to antigenic stimulation relative to the same cells tested fresh. Additionally, we tested whether it is better to cryopreserve endocervical cells on the cytobrush or in suspension.\\n\\nConclusionsLeukocytes from cervicovaginal and colorectal tissues can be cryopreserved with good recovery of functional, viable cells using several different cryopreservation media. The number and volume of washes has an experimentally meaningful effect on the percentage of cells recovered.

    "abstract": "The case-control association study is a powerful method for identifying genetic variants that influence disease risk. However, the collection of cases can be time-consuming and expensive; if a disease occurs late in life or is rapidly lethal, it may be more practical to identify family members of cases. Here, we show that replacing cases with their first-degree relatives enables genome-wide association studies by proxy (GWAX). In randomly-ascertained cohorts, this approach enables previously infeasible studies of diseases that are absent (or nearly absent) in the cohort. As an illustration, we performed GWAX of 12 common diseases in 116,196 individuals from the UK Biobank. By combining these results with published GWAS summary statistics in a meta-analysis, we replicated established risk loci and identified 17 newly associated risk loci: four in Alzheimers disease, eight in coronary artery disease, and five in type 2 diabetes. In addition to informing disease biology, our results demonstrate the utility of association mapping using family history of disease as a phenotype to be mapped. We anticipate that this approach will prove useful in future genetic studies of complex traits in large population cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Duplicating chromosomes once each cell cycle produces sister chromatid pairs, which separate accurately at anaphase. In contrast, reduplicating chromosomes without separation frequently produces polytene chromosomes, a barrier to accurate mitosis. Chromosome reduplication occurs in many contexts, including: polytene tissue development, polytene tumors, and following treatment with mitosis-blocking chemotherapeutics. However, mechanisms responding to or resolving polyteny during mitosis are poorly understood. Here, using Drosophila, we uncover two distinct reduplicated chromosome responses. First, when reduplicated polytene chromosomes persist into metaphase, an anaphase delay prevents tissue malformation and apoptosis. Second, reduplicated polytene chromosomes can also separate prior to metaphase through a spindlePindependent mechanism termed Separation-Into-Recent-Sisters (SIRS). Both reduplication responses require the spindle assembly checkpoint protein Mad2. While Mad2 delays anaphase separation of metaphase polytene chromosomes, Mad2s control of overall mitotic timing ensures efficient SIRS. Our results pinpoint mechanisms enabling continued proliferation after genome reduplication, a finding with implications for cancer progression and prevention.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCollective animal behavior such as the flocking of birds or the shoaling of fish has inspired a class of algorithms designed to optimize distance-based clusters in various applications including document analysis and DNA microarrays. In the flocking model, individual agents respond only to their immediate environment and move according to a few simple rules. After several iterations the agents self-organize and clusters emerge without the need for partitional seeds. In addition to their unsupervised nature, flocking offers several computational advantages including the potential to decrease the number of required comparisons.\\n\\nFindingsIn Clusterflock, we implement a flocking algorithm designed to find groups (flocks) of orthologous gene families (OGFs) that share a common evolutionary history. Pairwise distances that measure the phylogenetic incongruence between OGFs guide flock formation. We test this approach on several simulated datasets varying the number of underlying topologies, the proportion of missing data, and evolutionary rates, and show that in datasets containing high levels of missing data and rate heterogeneity, clusterflock outperforms other well-established clustering techniques. We also demonstrate its utility on a known, large-scale recombination event in Staphylococcus aureus. By isolating sets of OGFs with divergent phylogenetic signal, we can pinpoint the recombined region without forcing a pre-determined number of groupings or defining a pre-determined incongruence threshold.\\n\\nConclusionsClusterflock is an open source tool that can be used to discover horizontally transferred genes, recombining areas of chromosomes, and the phylogenetic \\\"core\\\" of a genome. Though we use it in an evolutionary context, it is generalizable to any clustering problem. Users can write extensions to calculate any distance metric on the unit interval and use these distances to flock any type of data.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules are dynamic polymers of {beta}-tubulin that have essential roles in chromosome segregation and organizing the cytoplasm. Catastrophe - the switch from growing to shrinking - occurs when a microtubule loses its stabilizing GTP cap. Recent evidence indicates that the nucleotide on the microtubule end controls how tightly an incoming subunit will be bound (trans-acting GTP), but most current models do not incorporate this information. We implemented transacting GTP into a computational model for microtubule dynamics. In simulations, growing microtubules often exposed terminal GDP-bound subunits without undergoing catastrophe. Transient GDP exposure on the growing plus end slowed elongation by reducing the number of favorable binding sites on the microtubule end. Slower elongation led to erosion of the GTP cap and an increase in the frequency of catastrophe. Allowing GDP to GTP exchange on terminal subunits in simulations mitigated these effects. Using mutant {beta}-tubulin or modified GTP, we showed experimentally that a more readily exchangeable nucleotide led to less frequent catastrophe. Current models for microtubule dynamics do not account for GDP to GTP exchange on the growing microtubule end, so our findings provide a new way of thinking about the molecular events that initiate catastrophe.",

    "abstract": "Conditions experienced early in life can affect key life-history traits. Individuals that experience a poor nutritional environment early in life can reduce potential costs by delaying sexual maturation. The direct costs of delaying maturation are well known (i.e. delayed onset of breeding), but individuals can also face additional costs as adults. Some of these  hidden costs accrue due to cryptic morphological and physiological changes. In mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), males with limited food intake early in life delay maturation to eventually reach a similar adult body size to their well-fed counterparts ( catch-up growth). Here we tested whether a poor diet early in life incurs hidden costs due to reduced expression of sexually selected male traits (genital size and ejaculate traits). We found that diet early in life significantly influenced sperm reserves and replenishment rate due to age and development-rate dependent effects. Although catching-up in body size ameliorates some of the costs of a poor start in life for males, our findings suggest that long-term fitness costs might arise because of sexually selection against these males. Our results highlight that fitness costs of a poor start in life can extend into adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Environmental variation can maintain genetic variation in sexually selected traits if it affects the strength of directional selection. Specifically, environmental variation in sex-specific mortality will change the operational sex ratio (OSR), which predicts the intensity of mating competition. How the OSR affects selection for specific male traits is poorly understood; and it is unknown how often sexual selection is affected by interactions between the OSR and environmental factors that alter social variables such as mate encounter rates. Here, we experimentally manipulated the OSR and habitat complexity and quantified sexual selection on male mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). In G. holbrooki there is high within-population variation in male size, which may exist because of a tradeoff between the ability to sneak copulate (favouring small males) and monopolize females (favouring large males). The success of each tactic is predicted to depend on the OSR, encounter rates and the ability to stealthily approach conspecifics. We show that, despite greater sharing of paternity under a male-biased OSR, neither the opportunity for selection, nor selection on male traits was affected by the OSR or habitat complexity. Instead, sexual selection consistently favored smaller males with high genetic heterozygosity (using >3000 SNP markers), and a relatively long gonopodium (intromittent organ).",

    "abstract": "Although there are many correlational studies, unbiased estimates of inbreeding depression only come from experimental studies that create inbred and outbred individuals. Few such studies determine the extent to which inbreeding depression in males is due to natural or sexual selection. Importantly, traits that are closely related to fitness are predicted to be most strongly affected by inbreeding depression, so measuring fitness or key fitness components, rather than phenotypic traits, is necessary to estimate inbreeding depression accurately. Here, we experimentally created inbred and outbred male mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) by mating full-sibs (f=0.25). We show this led to a 23% reduction in genome-wide heterozygosity. Males were then raised on different diets early in life. We then allowed adult males to compete freely for females to test if inbreeding, early diet, and their interaction affect a males share of paternity. Early diet had no effect on paternity, but outbred males sired almost twice as many offspring as inbred males. We also found that males with a relatively long gonopodium (intromittent organ) had greater reproductive success. We demonstrate that inbreeding has important consequences because it negatively affects a key component of male fitness. Given there was no difference in adult mortality this finding can only be due to inbreeding negatively affecting sexually selected traits.",

These EHB can be obligate or facultative symbionts, and can mediate a diverse phenotypic traits in their hosts. Although EHB have been observed in many major lineages of fungi, it remains unclear how widespread and general these associations are, and whether there are unifying ecological and genomic features found across all EHB strains. We cultured 11 bacterial strains after they emerged from the hyphae of diverse Ascomycota that were isolated as foliar endophytes of cupressaceous trees, and generated nearly complete genome sequences for all. Unlike the genomes of largely obligate EHB, genomes of these facultative EHB resemble those of closely related strains isolated from environmental sources. Although all analyzed genomes encode structures that can be used to interact with eukaryotic hosts, we find no known pathways that facilitate intimate EHB-fungal interactions in all strains. We isolated two strains with nearly identical genomes from different classes of fungi, consistent with previous suggestions of horizontal transfer of EHB across endophytic hosts. Because bacteria are differentially present during the fungal life cycle, these genomes could shed light on the mechanisms of plant growth promotion by fungal endophytes during the symbiotic phase as well as degradation of plant material during saprotrophic and reproductive phases. Given the capacity of EHB to influence fungal phenotypes, these findings illuminate a new dimension of fungal biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Circulating cytokines and growth factors are regulators of inflammation and have been implicated in autoimmune and metabolic diseases. In this genome-wide association study (GWAS) up to n=8,293 Finns we identified 27 loci with genome-wide association (P-value<1.2x10-9) for one or more cytokines, including 17 unidentified in previous GWASes. Fifteen of the associated SNPs had expression quantitative trait loci in whole blood. We provide strong genetic instruments to clarify the causal roles of cytokine signaling and upstream inflammation in immune-related and other chronic diseases. We further link known autoimmune disease variants including Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis with new inflammatory markers, which elucidate the molecular mechanisms underpinning these diseases and suggest potential drug targets.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSEEvaluation of 12 ccRCC publicly-available ccRCC gene expression datasets showed that previously proposed discrete molecular subtypes are unstable. To reflect the continuous nature of gene expression observed, we developed a quantitative score (Continuous Linear Enhanced Assessment of Renal cell carcinoma, or CLEAR) using expression analysis founded on pathologic parameters.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS265 ccRCC gene expression profiles were used to develop the CLEAR score, representing a genetic correlate of the continuum of morphological tumor grade. A signature derivation method based on correlation of CLEAR score with gene expression ranking was used to derive an 18-transcript signature. External validation was conducted in multiple public expression datasets.\\n\\nResultsAs a measure of intertumoral gene expression heterogeneity, the CLEAR score demonstrated both superior prognostic estimates (94% vs 83% adequacy index in TCGA dataset) and inverse correlation with anti-angiogenic tyrosine-kinase inhibition (65% vs 55% adequacy index) in comparison to previously proposed discrete subtyping classifications. Inverse correlation with high-dose interleukin-2 outcomes was also observed for the CLEAR score (p=0.05). Multiple somatic mutations (VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, KDM5C, TP53, BAP1, PTEN, MTOR) were associated with the CLEAR score. Application of the CLEAR score to independent expression profiling of intratumoral ccRCC regions demonstrated its ability to reflect intratumoral expression heterogeneity and further analysis showed average intertumoral heterogeneity exceeded intratumoral heterogeneity.\\n\\nConclusionsThe CLEAR score, a gene expression signature developed on histopathology, outperformed discrete subtype-classification in prognostic estimates and correlated better with treatment outcomes. Recognizing cancer as a continuum has important implications for laboratory and clinical research.",
