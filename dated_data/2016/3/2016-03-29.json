    "abstract": "Approximately 2-4% of genetic material in human populations outside Africa is derived from Neanderthals who interbred with anatomically modern humans. Recent studies have shown that this Neanderthal DNA is depleted around functional genomic regions; this has been suggested to be a consequence of harmful epistatic interactions between human and Neanderthal alleles. However, using published estimates of Neanderthal inbreeding and the distribution of mutational fitness effects, we infer that Neanderthals had at least 40% lower fitness than humans on average; this increased load predicts the reduction in Neanderthal introgression around genes without the need to invoke epistasis. We also predict a residual Neanderthal mutational load in non-Africans, leading to a fitness reduction of at least 0.5%. This effect of Neanderthal admixture has been left out of previous debate on mutation load differences between Africans and non-Africans. We also show that if many deleterious mutations are recessive, the Neanderthal admixture fraction could increase over time due to the protective effect of Neanderthal haplotypes against deleterious alleles that arose recently in the human population. This might partially explain why so many organisms retain gene flow from other species and appear to derive adaptive benefits from introgression.",

    "abstract": "The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.",

    "abstract": "Although soybean seeds appear homogeneous, their composition (protein, oil and mineral concentrations) can vary significantly with the canopy position where they were produced. In studies with 10 cultivars grown over a 3-yr period, we found that seeds produced at the top of the canopy have higher concentrations of protein but less oil and lower concentrations of minerals such as Mg, Fe, and Cu compared to seeds produced at the bottom of the canopy. Among cultivars, mean protein concentration (average of different positions) correlated positively with mean concentrations of S, Zn and Fe, but not other minerals. Therefore, on a whole plant basis, the uptake and allocation of S, Zn and Fe to seeds correlated with the production and allocation of reduced N to seed protein; however, the reduced N and correlated minerals (S, Zn and Fe) showed different patterns of allocation among node positions. For example, while mean concentrations of protein and Fe correlated positively, the two parameters correlated negatively in terms of variation with canopy position. Altering the microenvironment within the soybean canopy by removing neighboring plants at flowering increased protein concentration in particular at lower node positions and thus altered the node-position gradient in protein (and oil) without altering the distribution of Mg, Fe and Cu, suggesting different underlying control mechanisms. Metabolomic analysis of developing seeds at different positions in the canopy suggests that availability of free asparagine may be a positive determinant of storage protein accumulation in seeds and may explain the increased protein accumulation in seeds produced at the top of the canopy. Our results establish node-position variation in seed constituents and provide a new experimental system to identify genes controlling key aspects of seed composition. In addition, our results provide an unexpected and simple approach to link agronomic practices to improve human nutrition and health in developing countries because food products produced from seeds at the bottom of the canopy contained higher Fe concentrations than products from the top of the canopy. Therefore, using seeds produced in the lower canopy for production of iron-rich soy foods for human consumption could be important when plants are the major source of protein and human diets can be chronically deficient in Fe and other minerals.",

    "abstract": "In addition to its role in forming vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the coat protein complex II (COPII) is also responsible for selecting specific cargo proteins to be packaged into COPII transport vesicles. Comparison of COPII vesicle formation in mammalian systems and in yeast suggested that the former employs more elaborate mechanisms for cargo recognition, presumably to cope with a significantly expanded repertoire of cargo that transits the secretory pathway. Using proTGF, the transmembrane precursor of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF), as a model cargo protein, we demonstrate in cell-free assays that at least one auxiliary cytosolic factor is specifically required for the efficient packaging of proTGF into COPII vesicles. Using a knockout HeLa cell line generated by CRISPR/Cas9, we provide functional evidence showing that a transmembrane protein, Cornichon-1 (CNIH), acts as a cargo receptor of proTGF. We show that both CNIH and the auxiliary cytosolic factor(s) are required for efficient recruitment of proTGF to the COPII coat in vitro. Moreover, we provide evidence that the recruitment of cargo protein by the COPII coat precedes and may be distinct from subsequent cargo packaging into COPII vesicles.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Many disciplines, from human genetics and oncology to plant breeding, microbiology and virology, commonly face the challenge of analyzing rapidly increasing numbers of genomes. In case of Homo sapiens, the number of sequenced genomes will approach hundreds of thousands in the next few years. Simply scaling up established bioinformatics pipelines will not be sufficient for leveraging the full potential of such rich genomic datasets. Instead, novel, qualitatively different computational methods and paradigms are needed. We will witness the rapid extension of computational pan-genomics, a new sub-area of research in computational biology. In this paper, we generalize existing definitions and understand a pan-genome as any collection of genomic sequences to be analyzed jointly or to be used as a reference. We examine already available approaches to construct and use pan-genomes, discuss the potential benefits of future technologies and methodologies, and review open challenges from the vantage point of the above-mentioned biological disciplines. As a prominent example for a computational paradigm shift, we particularly highlight the transition from the representation of reference genomes as strings to representations as graphs. We outline how this and other challenges from different application domains translate into common computational problems, point out relevant bioinformatics techniques and identify open problems in computer science. With this review, we aim to increase awareness that a joint approach to computational pan-genomics can help address many of the problems currently faced in various domains.",

    "abstract": "In the past ten years, many studies have shown that malignant tissue has been \\\"normalized\\\" in vitro using mechanical signals. We apply the principles of physical oncology (or mechanobiology) in vivo to show the effect of a \\\"constraint field\\\" on tumor growth. The human breast cancer cell line, MDA MB 231, admixed with ferric nanoparticles was grafted subcutaneously in Nude mice. The magnetizable particles rapidly surrounded the growing tumor. Two permanent magnets located on either side of the tumor created a gradient of magnetic field. Magnetic energy is transformed into mechanical energy by the particles acting as \\\"bioactuators\\\", applying a constraint field and, by consequence, biomechanical stress to the tumor. This biomechanical treatment was applied 2 hours/day during 21 days, from Day 18 to Day 39 following tumor implantation. The study lasted 74 days. Palpable tumor was measured two times a week. There was a significant in vivo difference between the median volume of treated tumors and untreated controls in the mice measured up to D 74 (D 59 + population): (529 [346; 966] mm3 vs 1334 [256; 2106] mm3; p=0.015), treated mice having smaller tumors. The difference was not statistically significant in the group of mice measured at least to D 59 (D 59 population). On ex vivo examination, the surface of the tumor mass, measured on histologic sections, was less in the treated group, G1, than in the control groups: G2 (nanoparticles, no magnetic field), G3 (magnetic field, no nanoparticles), G4 (no nanoparticles, no magnetic field) in the D 59 population (Median left surface was significantly lower in G1 (5.6 [3.0; 42.4] mm2, p=0.005) than in G2 (20.8 [4.9; 34.3]), G3 (16.5 [13.2; 23.2]) and G4 (14.8 [1.8; 55.5]); Median right surface was significantly lower in G1 (4.7 [1.9; 29.2] mm2, p=0.015) than in G2 (25.0 [5.2; 55.0]), G3 (18.0 [14.6; 35.2]) and G4 (12.5 [1.5; 51.8]). There was no statistically significant difference in the day 59+ population. This is the first demonstration of the effect of stress on tumor growth in vivo suggesting that biomechanical intervention may have a high translational potential as a therapy in locally advanced tumors like pancreatic cancer or primary hepatic carcinoma for which no effective therapy is currently available.",

    "abstract": "Uncovering the genetic basis of adaptation is one of the greatest challenges facing modern evolutionary biology, often sparking much controversy, especially among practitioners within different subfields. Here we ask where is the locus of adaptation from the perspective of ecological genomics (ecogen) and evolutionary developmental biology (evodevo). Ecogen focuses on identifying loci under selection between populations living in different environments by scanning genome-wide patterns of genetic divergence, while evodevo focuses on candidate developmental regulatory genes and networks underlying phenotypic differences between species and higher taxa. We attempt to reconcile these alternative perspectives by studying the response of ant populations to past climate change on the Arizona Sky Islands, which are high elevation mountain ranges that represents a replicated natural experiment. We previously showed that adaptation to climatic changes in the Arizona Sky Islands in ant species Monomorium emersoni occurred through repeatable changes within the gene network underlying the development of dispersal alternative phenotypes: winged and wingless queens. Here, we uncover several loci under positive selection which associate with habitat temperature, a pattern consistent with a predictable and repeated increase in frequency following climatic changes on each of the Sky Islands. Furthermore, we show that gene flow between locations within a Sky Island is not a consequence of dispersal phenotypes and its gene network, but rather, is restricted by temperature adaptation along the ecological gradient. This suggests that the determination of winged and wingless queens may be developmentally plastic, and this plasticity and may facilitate jumps between adaptive peaks on the fitness landscape. This complex interplay promotes predictability on both genetic and phenotypic levels for multiple traits in the same species.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in analyzing next-generation sequencing data is to determine an individuals genotype correctly as the accuracy of the inferred genotype is essential to downstream analyses. Some genotype callers, such as GATK and SAMtools, directly calculate the base-calling error rates from phred scores or recalibrated base quality scores. Others, such as SeqEM, estimate error rates from the read data without using any quality scores. It is also a common quality control procedure to filter out reads with low phred scores. However, choosing an appropriate phred score threshold is problematic as a too-high threshold may lose data while a too-low threshold may introduce errors. We propose a new likelihood-based genotype-calling approach that exploits all reads and estimates the per-base error rates by incorporating phred scores through a logistic regression model. The algorithm, which we call PhredEM, uses the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain consistent estimates of genotype frequencies and logistic regression parameters. We also develop a simple, computationally efficient screening algorithm to identify loci that are estimated to be monomorphic, so that only loci estimated to be non-monomorphic require application of the EM algorithm. We evaluate the performance of PhredEM using both simulated data and real sequencing data from the UK10K project. The results demonstrate that PhredEM is an improved, robust and widely applicable genotype-calling approach for next-generation sequencing studies. The relevant software is freely available.",

Methods developed for analyzing ordered bulk RNA-seq experiments are not applicable to scRNA-seq, since their distributional assumptions are often violated by additional heterogeneities prevalent in scRNA-seq. Here we present SC-Pattern - an empirical Bayes model to characterize genes with expression changes in ordered scRNA-seq experiments. SCPattern utilizes the non-parametrical Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, thus it has the flexibility to identify genes with a wide variety of types of changes. Additionally, the Bayes framework allows SCPattern to classify genes into expression patterns with probability estimates.\\n\\nResultsSimulation results show that SCPattern is well powered for identifying genes with expression changes while the false discovery rate is well controlled. SCPattern is also able to accurately classify these dynamic genes into directional expression patterns. Applied to a scRNA-seq time course dataset studying human embryonic cell differentiation, SCPattern detected a group of important genes that are involved in mesendoderm and definitive endoderm cell fate decisions, positional patterning, and cell cycle.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationThe SCPattern is implemented as an R package along with a user-friendly graphical interface, which are available at:https://github.com/lengning/SCPattern\\n\\nContact: rstewart@morgridge.org",

We tested the hypothesis that sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.) would have fewer adventitious root-climbing lianas. We reasoned that because P. occidentalis possesses exfoliating bark, it would periodically shed newly-established lianas from the trunk. We investigated the distribution of lianas on the trunks of trees [&ge;]10 cm DBH in floodplains in southwestern Ohio. Contrary to predictions, P. occidentalis trees had significantly more root-climbing lianas than expected at three of five sites, and significantly fewer than expected at one site. In contrast, members of the Acer genus (boxelder (A. negundo L.), sugar maple (A. saccharum L.) and silver maple (A. saccharinum L.) had less than half of the root-climbing lianas as expected. We find no support for our hypothesis that bark exfoliation protects P. occidentalis trees from root-climbing lianas in our study, and suggest possible mechanisms that might protect Acer species from adventitious root-climbing lianas.",

Intron retention is the major type of alternative splicing, followed by \\\"alternate intron in exon\\\". 887 novel transcription units are detected; 60 of the predicted proteins show homology in other species and form theoretical stable structures. We compare the dynamics of novel isoforms based on the number of supporting full-length reads with those of annotated isoforms and explore the translational capacity and quality of novel isoforms. The evaluation of these factors indicates that the majority of novel isoforms are unlikely to be both condition-specific and translatable but the possibility of functional novel isoforms is not excluded. Moreover, the co-option of these unusual transcripts into newly born genes seems likely.

In RNA-Seq however the artifactual reads are not easy to tell apart from normal read duplication due to natural over-sequencing of highly expressed genes. Especially when working with little input material or single cells assessing the fraction of duplicate reads is an important quality control step for NGS data sets. Up to now there are only tools to calculate the global duplication rates that do not take into account the effect of gene expression levels which leaves them of limited use for RNA-Seq data.\\n\\nResultsHere we present the tool dupRadar, which provides an easy means to distinguish artefactual from natural duplicate reads in RNA-Seq data. dupRadar assesses the fraction of duplicate reads per gene dependent on the expression level. Apart from the Bioconductor package dupRadar we provide shell scripts for easy integration into processing pipelines.\\n\\nConclusionsThe Bioconductor package dupRadar offers straight-forward methods to assess RNA-Seq datasets for quality issues with PCR duplicates.

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough metatranscriptomics--the study of diverse microbial population activity based on RNA-seq data--is rapidly growing in popularity, there are limited options for biologists to analyze this type of data. Current approaches for processing metatranscriptomes rely on restricted databases and a dedicated computing cluster, or metagenome-based approaches that have not been fully evaluated for processing metatranscriptomic datasets. We created a new bioinformatics pipeline, SAMSA, designed specifically for metatranscriptome dataset analysis, which runs either inhouse or in conjunction with Metagenome-RAST (MG-RAST) servers. Designed for use by researchers with relatively little bioinformatics experience, SAMSA offers a breakdown of metatranscriptome activity by organism or transcript function, and is fully open source. We next used this new tool to evaluate best practices for sequencing stool metatranscriptomes.\\n\\nResultsWorking with the MG-RAST annotation server, we constructed the Simple Annotation of Metatranscriptomes by Sequence Analysis (SAMSA) software package, a complete pipeline for the analysis of gut microbiome data. In creating this package, we determined optimal parameters in data collection and processing. SAMSA can summarize and evaluate raw annotation results, identifying abundant species and significant functional differences between metatranscriptomes.\\n\\nUsing pilot data and simulated subsets, we determined experimental requirements for fecal gut metatranscriptomes. Sequences need to be either long reads (longer than 100bp) or paired-end reads that can be joined. Each sample nees 40-50 million raw sequences which can be expected to yield the 5-10 million annotated reads necessary for accurate abundance measures. We also demonstrated that ribosomal RNA depletion does not equally deplete ribosomes from all species within a sample, and remaining rRNA sequences should be discarded. Using publicly available metatranscriptome data in which rRNA was not depleted, we were able to demonstrate that organism activity can be measured using mRNA counts. We were also able to detect significant differences between control and experimental groups in both organism activity and functional activity.\\n\\nConclusionsBy making this new pipeline publicly available, we have created a powerful new tool for metatranscriptomics research, offering a new method for greater insight into the activity of diverse microbial communities. We further recommend that stool metatranscriptomes be ribodepleted and sequenced in a 100bp paired end format with a minimum of 40 million reads per sample.",

    "abstract": "This study describes the development of an integrated dengue alert system (InfoDengue), operating initially in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is a project developed as a partnership between academia and the municipal health secretariat. At the beginning of each epidemiological week, the system captures climate time series, dengue case reporting and activity on a social network. After data pre-processing, including a probabilistic correction of case notification delay, and calculation of dengue's effective reproductive number, indicators of dengue transmission are coded into four dengue situation levels, for each of the city's ten health districts. A risk map is generated to inform the public about the week's level of attention and the evolution of the disease incidence and suggest actions. A report is also sent automatically to the municipality's situation room, containing a detailed presentation of the data and alert levels by health district. The preliminary analysis of InfoDengue in Rio de Janeiro, using historical series from 2011 to 2014 and prospective data from January to December 2015, indicates good degree of confidence and accuracy. The successful experience in the city of Rio de Janeiro is a motivating argument for the expansion of InfoDengue to other cities. After a year in production, InfoDengue has become a unique source of carefully curated data for epidemiological studies, combining epidemological and environmental variables in unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions.\\n\\nEthical committee approval: 26910214.7.0000.5240",

    "abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance of the studyDiarrhea remains one of the main killers of children aged below five years. Traditional antidiarrheal remedies form a potentially viable source of novel low cost efficacious antidiarrheal remedies in low resource settings. There is therefore a pressing to scientifically evaluate these remedies.\\n\\nAim of the studyThis study aimed to investigate the in vivo and in vitro antidiarrheal activity of Bidens biternata a herb species used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine in the management of diarrhea.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsIn the castor oil test twenty (20) adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to the negative control (normal saline), positive control (5 mg/kg loperamide), (200 mg/kg Bidens biternata extract) and (400 mg/kg Bidens biternata extract) groups (n=5 in each group). Castor oil (4 ml/kg) was then administered to the animals one hour after administration of the respective treatments after which the total mass of fecal output excreted after four (4) hours was determined.\\n\\nIn the charcoal meal test fifteen (15) Sprague Dawley rats were randomized to the negative control (normal saline 5 ml/kg orally), the positive control (atropine sulphate 0.1 mg/kg i.p) and test (400 mg/kg Bidens biternata extract) groups (n=5). Charcoal meal was then administered via oral gavage to each rat thirty (30) minutes after the administration of the various treatments. The distance covered by the charcoal meal from the pylorus was then determined after sacrifice of the animals.\\n\\nIn the enteropooling test twenty (20) Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to the negative control (5% v/v ethanol in normal saline), positive control (5 mg/kg loperamide) and test (400 mg/kg Bidens biternata extract) groups and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (100g/kg) administered immediately after the treatments. The animals were then sacrificed half an hour later and the volume of the small intestine contents determined. The effects of different concentrations of Bidens biternata extract (0.5. 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 5.0 mg/ml) on jejunal contraction were investigated and a dose-response curve constructed using the experimental data after which The ED50 dose determined. The effect of tamsulosin (1 adrenergic blocker), yohimbine (2 adrenergic blocker), propranolol ({beta} adrenergic blocker) and naloxone ( opioid blocker) on the contractile activity of the extract were also investigated.\\n\\nThe experimental data were expressed as mean {+/-} standard error of mean (SEM) and then analyzed using one way ANOVA followed by Tukeys post hoc test in cases of significance (set at p<0.05).\\n\\nResultsThe freeze dried extracts of Bidens biternata had significant antidiarrhealeffects in the castor oil induced diarrhea model (p=0.0075) with maximal activity being observed at the 400mg/kg dosage level (1.66{+/-} 0.81g vs. 4.54 {+/-} 0.51 g negative control, p=0.01). Bidens biternata extract had significant effects on intestinal motility in the charcoal meal test compared to the control group (43.61 {+/-} 4.42% vs. 60.54 {+/-} 3.33%: p= 0.02). Bidens biternata extract had a significant effect on PGE2 induced enteropooling (3.06 {+/-} 0.07 ml vs. 4.74 {+/-} 0.10 ml; p<0.001).\\n\\nThe freeze dried extracts of Bidens biternata had a significant negative effect on the contractility of the isolated rabbit jejunum (p<0.001). The effects of the extract were significantly attenuated by tamsulosin (53.94 {+/-} 4.20% vs. 80.57 {+/-} 4.09%; p=0.0067) and naloxone (53.94 {+/-} 4.20% vs. 73.89 {+/-} 7.26 %; p=0.0358). Yohimbine (p=0.4598) and propranolol (p=0.5966) however did not have any significant effect on the contractile activity of the extract.\\n\\nConclusionsThe freeze dried extract of Bidens biternata possess significant antidiarrhealactivity in both in vitro and in vivo models which appears to be mediated by modulating both the intestinal motility as well as the secretory activity. The results of this study also validate its traditional use as an antidiarrheal remedy.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=196 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/046185_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1000\\\">\\nView larger version (15K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1251d73org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b08654org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@430f4forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a210cc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "In statistical genetics an important task involves building predictive models for the genotype-phenotype relationships and thus attribute a proportion of the total phenotypic variance to the variation in genotypes. Numerous models have been proposed to incorporate additive genetic effects into models for prediction or association. However, there is a scarcity of models that can adequately account for gene by gene or other forms of genetical interactions. In addition, there is an increased interest in using marker annotations in genome-wide prediction and association. In this paper, we discuss an hybrid modeling methodology which combines the parametric mixed modeling approach and the non-parametric rule ensembles. This approach gives us a flexible class of models that can be used to capture additive, locally epistatic genetic effects, gene x background interactions and allows us to incorporate one or more annotations into the genomic selection or association models. We use benchmark data sets covering a range of organisms and traits in addition to simulated data sets to illustrate the strengths of this approach. The improvement of model accuracies and association results suggest that a part of the missing heritability\\\" in complex traits can be captured by modeling local epistasis.",

    "abstract": "Information processing in early sensory regions is modulated by a diverse range of inhibitory interneurons. We sought to elucidate the role of olfactory bulb interneurons called granule cells (GCs) in odor processing by imaging the activity of hundreds of these cells simultaneously in mice. Odor responses in GCs were temporally diverse and spatially disperse, with some degree of non-random, modular organization. The overall sparseness of activation of GCs was highly correlated with the extent of glomerular activation by odor stimuli. Increasing concentrations of single odorants led to proportionately larger population activity, but some individual GCs had non-monotonic relation to concentration due to local inhibitory interactions. Individual dendritic segments could sometimes respond independently to odors, revealing their capacity for compartmentalized signaling in vivo. Collectively, the response properties of GCs point to their role in specific and local processing, rather than global operations such as response normalization proposed for other interneurons.",

    "abstract": "Genome sequencing has become commonplace, but the understanding of how those genomes ultimately specify cell fate during development is still elusive. Extrapolating insights from deep investigation of a handful of developmentally important Drosophila genes to understanding the regulation of all genes is a major challenge. The developing embryo provides a unique opportunity to study the role of gene expression in pattern specification; the precise and consistent spatial positioning of key transcription factors essentially provides separate transcriptional-readout experiments at a critical point in development.\\n\\nWe cryosectioned and sequenced mRNA from single Drosophila melanogaster embryos at the blastoderm stage to screen for spatially-varying regulation of transcription. Expanding on our previous screening of wild type embryos, here we present data from dosage mutants for key maternally provided regulators, including depletion of zelda and hunchback and both over-expression and depletion of bicoid. These data recapitulate all of the expected patterning changes driven by these regulators; for instance, we show spatially-confined up-regulation of expression in the bicoid over-expression condition, and down-regulation of those genes in the bicoid knock-down case, consistent with bicoids known function as an anterior-localized activator.\\n\\nOur data highlight the role of combinatorial regulation of patterning gene expression. When comparing changes in multiple conditions, genes responsive to one mutation tend to respond to other mutations in a similar fashion. Furthermore, genes that respond differently to these mutations tend to have more complex patterns of TF binding.",

    "abstract": "The problem of de-novo assembly for metagenomes using only long reads is gaining attention. We study whether post-processing metagenomic assemblies with the original input long reads can result in quality improvement. Previous approaches have focused on pre-processing reads and optimizing assemblers. BIGMAC takes an alternative perspective to focus on the post-processing step. Using both the assembled contigs and original long reads as input, BIGMAC first breaks the contigs at potentially mis-assembled locations and subsequently scaffolds contigs. Our experiments on metagenomes assembled from long reads show that BIGMAC can improve assembly quality by reducing the number of mis-assemblies while maintaining/increasing N50 and N75.
