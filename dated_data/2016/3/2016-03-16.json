    "abstract": "Recombinant Sindbis viruses are important tools in neuroscience because they combine rapid and high transgene expression with a capacity to carry large transgenes. Currently, two packaging systems based on the DH(26S)5SIN and the DH-BB(tRNA;TE12) Defective Helper (DH) RNAs are available for making recombinant Sindbis virus that is neurotropic (able to infect neurons and potentially other cells). Both systems produce a fraction of viral particles that can propagate beyond the primary infected neuron. When injected into mouse brains, viruses produced using these DH RNAs label neurons at the injection site, but also elsewhere in the brain. Such ectopic labeling caused recombinant Sindbis viruses to be classified as anterograde viruses with limited retrograde spread, and can complicate the interpretation of neuroanatomical and other experiments.\\n\\nHere we describe a new DH RNA, DH-BB(5SIN;TE12ORF), that can be used to produce virus that is both neurotropic and propagation-incompetent. We show in mice that DH-BB(5SIN;TE12ORF)- packaged virus eliminates infection of cells outside the injection site. We also provide evidence that ectopically labeled cells observed in previous experiments with recombinant Sindbis virus resulted from secondary infection by propagation-competent virus, rather than from inefficient retrograde spread.\\n\\nVirus produced with our new packaging system retains all the advantages of previous recombinant Sindbis viruses, but minimizes the risks of confounding results with unwanted ectopic labeling. It should therefore be considered in future studies in which a neurotropic, recombinant Sindbis virus is needed.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial (mt) genome is present in many copies in human cells, and intra-individual variation in mtDNA sequences is known as heteroplasmy. Recent studies found that heteroplasmies are highly tissue-specific, site-specific, and allele-specific, however the functional implications have not been explored. This study investigates variation in mtDNA copy numbers (mtCN) in 12 different tissues obtained at autopsy from 152 individuals (ranging in age from 3 days to 96 years). Three different methods to estimate mtCN were compared: shotgun sequencing (in 4 tissues), capture-enriched sequencing (in 12 tissues) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR, in 2 tissues). The highest precision in mtCN estimation was achieved using shotgun sequencing data. However, capture-enrichment data provide reliable estimates of relative (albeit not absolute) mtCNs. Comparisons of mtCN from different tissues of the same individual revealed that mtCNs in different tissues are, with few exceptions, uncorrelated. Hence, each tissue of an individual seems to regulate mtCN in a tissue-related rather than an individual-dependent manner. Skeletal muscle (SM) samples showed an age-related decrease in mtCN that was especially pronounced in males, while there was an age-related increase in mtCN for liver (LIV) samples. MtCN in SM samples was significantly negatively correlated with both the total number of heteroplasmic sites and with minor allele frequency (MAF) at two heteroplasmic sites, 408 and 16327. Heteroplasmies at both sites are highly specific for SM, accumulate with aging and are part of functional elements that regulate mtDNA replication. These data support the hypothesis that selection acting on these heteroplasmic sites is reducing mtCN in SM of older individuals.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe total number of mitochondrial genomes in a human cell differs between individuals and between the tissues of a single individual; however the factors that influence this variation remain unknown. We estimated mtDNA copy number (mtCN) in 12 different tissues of 152 individuals applying three different methods, and found age-related variation for two tissues: mtCN in skeletal muscle is negatively correlated with age (especially in males) while mtCN in liver is positively correlated with age. Overall, mtCNs of different tissues within an individual are mainly independent of each other, indicating that tissue-specific rather than individual-specific processes largely influence mtCN.\\n\\nHeteroplasmy refers to intra-individual differences in the sequence of the mtDNA genome and heteroplasmic mutations accumulate during aging. Linear and partial regression analyses of mtCN with heteroplasmy (determined in a previous study of these same samples) revealed that the decrease of mtCN in skeletal muscle is mainly correlated with an increasing total number of heteroplasmic sites, and with increasing minor allele frequency at two sites (408 and 16327), that are heteroplasmic almost exclusively in skeletal muscle. As both sites are part of functional elements required for regulation of mtDNA replication, we suggest that selection may be acting via increasing heteroplasmy to reduce mtCN during aging.",

    "abstract": "The phylogenetic likelihood function is the major computational bottleneck in several applications of evolutionary biology such as phylogenetic inference, species delimitation, model selection and divergence times estimation. Given the alignment, a tree and the evolutionary model parameters, the likelihood function computes the conditional likelihood vectors for every node of the tree. Vector entries for which all input data are identical result in redundant likelihood operations which, in turn, yield identical conditional values. Such operations can be omitted for improving run-time and, using appropriate data structures, reducing memory usage. We present a fast, novel method for identifying and omitting such redundant operations in phylogenetic likelihood calculations, and assess the performance improvement and memory saving attained by our method. Using empirical and simulated data sets, we show that a prototype implementation of our method yields up to 10-fold speedups and uses up to 78% less memory than one of the fastest and most highly tuned implementations of the phylogenetic likelihood function currently available. Our method is generic and can seamlessly be integrated into any phylogenetic likelihood implementation.",

    "abstract": "Although underdominant mutations have undoubtedly fixed between divergent species, classical models of population genetics suggest underdominant alleles should be purged quickly, except in small or subdivided populations. Here we study the fixation of underdominant alleles at loci that also influence mate choice, such as loci encoding coloration patterns visible to mates and predators alike. We analyze a mechanistic model of positive assortative mating in which individuals have n chances to sample compatible mates. This one-parameter model naturally spans the two classical extremes of random mating (n = 1) and complete assortment (n [-&gt;] {infty}), and yet it produces a complex form of sexual selection that depends non-monotonically on the number of mating opportunities, n. The resulting interaction between viability selection and sexual selection can either inhibit or facilitate fixation of underdominant alleles, compared to random mating. As the number of mating opportunities increases, underdominant alleles can fix at rates that even approach the neutral substitution rate. This result is counterintuitive because sexual selection and underdominance each suppress rare alleles in this model, and yet in combination they can promote the fixation of rare alleles. This phenomenon constitutes a new mechanism for the fixation of underdominant alleles in large populations, and it illustrates how incorporating life history characteristics can alter the predictions of population-genetic models for evolutionary change.",

We will focus on the distinctive oscillatory profiles of the SZ and ASD brains, in turn using these insights to refine our understanding of how the brain computes language by exploring a novel model of linguistic feature-set composition. We will argue that brain rhythms constitute the best route to interpreting language deficits in both conditions and mapping them to neural dysfunction and risk alleles of the genes. Importantly, candidate genes for SZ and ASD are overrepresented among the gene sets believed to be important for language evolution. This translational effort may help develop an understanding of the aetiology of SZ and ASD and their high prevalence among modern populations.",

    "abstract": "Humans efficiently grasp complex visual environments, making highly consistent judgments of entry-level category despite their high variability in visual appearance. How does the human brain arrive at the invariant neural representations underlying categorization of real-world environments? We here show that the neural representation of visual environments in scenes-selective human visual cortex relies on statistics of contour junctions, which provide cues for the three-dimensional arrangement of surfaces in a scene. We manipulated line drawings of real-world environments such that statistics of contour orientations or junctions were disrupted. Manipulated and intact line drawings were presented to participants in an fMRI experiment. Scene categories were decoded from neural activity patterns in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the occipital place area (OPA) and other visual brain regions. Disruption of junctions but not orientations led to a drastic decrease in decoding accuracy in the PPA and OPA, indicating the reliance of these areas on intact junction statistics. Accuracy of decoding from early visual cortex, on the other hand, was unaffected by either image manipulation. We further show that the correlation of error patterns between decoding from the scene-selective brain areas and behavioral experiments is contingent on intact contour junctions. Finally, a searchlight analysis exposes the reliance of visually active brain regions on different sets of contour properties. Statistics of contour length and curvature dominate neural representations of scene categories in early visual areas and contour junctions in high-level scene-selective brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Developmental gene regulatory networks (dGRNs) are assemblages of interacting regulatory factors that direct ontogeny of animal body plans. The hierarchical topology of these networks predicts that their nodes will evolve at different rates and consequently will bias the trajectories of embryonic evolution. To test this, detailed, comparative analyses of dGRNs that specify early, global embryonic domains are required. The most extensively detailed dGRNs have been documented for one of the two subclasses of extant sea urchins, the euechinoids. Remarkably, euechinoid dGRNs operating in early development show little appreciable change even though they diverged approximately 90 million years ago (mya). Therefore, to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of dGRNs, comparative microdissection must be undertaken for sea urchins that diverged deeper in geological time. Recent studies of cidaroids, the sister clade of euechinoid sea urchins, suggest that comparative analyses of their embryonic domain specification may prove insightful for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of dGRNs. Here, I report the spatiotemporal dynamics of 19 regulatory factors involved in dorsal-ventral patterning of non-skeletogenic mesodermal and ectodermal domains in the early development of Eucidaris tribuloides, a cidaroid sea urchin. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that deployment of ectodermal regulatory factors is more impervious to change than mesodermal regulatory factors in the sea urchin lineage and are supported by multiple lines of experimental evidence. Additionally, endogenous spatiotemporal expression data, intra-class reporter microinjections, and perturbation analyses of Nodal and Notch signaling allow the enumeration of numerous alterations to regulatory factor deployment since the divergence of echinoids. These results provide a global view of early embryonic developmental processes in two clades that diverged at least 268.8 mya and show that the dGRNs controlling embryonic specification exhibit differential lability, supporting the hypothesis that the topologies of dGRNs bias rates of evolutionary change and alter the developmental evolutionary trajectories of embryogenesis.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEarly in the development of an embryo, networks of genes are initiated to differentiate the rapidly dividing cells into distinct territories that will later serve specific functions. Sea urchins have revealed much about how this process unfolds. Recent studies have focused on one of the two modern lineages of sea urchins and have shown that these processes have not appreciably changed over the past 90 million years. I sought to determine if this trend extends over even larger evolutionary distances by investigating similar processes in a sea urchin from the second modern lineage, which is removed by 268 million years of evolution. By revealing where and when these genes are expressed and interfering with common mechanisms of development in a distantly related sea urchin, I show that changes to these networks of genes have occurred at all levels of the network. Additionally, I present data that suggests that changes to these networks of genes occur disproportionately in certain embryonic territories, which may be true for early development for other groups of organisms as well.",

    "abstract": "A ubiquitous feature of all living cells is their growth over time followed by division into two daughter cells. How a population of genetically identical cells maintains size homeostasis, i.e., a narrow distribution of cell size, is an intriguing fundamental problem. We model size using a stochastic hybrid system, where a cell grows exponentially over time and probabilistic division events are triggered at discrete time intervals. Moreover, whenever these events occur, size is randomly partitioned among daughter cells. We first consider a scenario, where a timer (i.e., cell-cycle clock) that measures the time since the last division event regulates cellular growth and the rate of cell division. Analysis reveals that such a timer-driven system cannot achieve size homeostasis, in the sense that, the cell-to-cell size variation grows unboundedly with time. To explore biologically meaningful mechanisms for controlling size we consider three different classes of models: i) a size-dependent growth rate and timer-dependent division rate; ii) a constant growth rate and size-dependent division rate and iii) a constant growth rate and division rate that depends both on the cell size and timer. We show that each of these strategies can potentially achieve bounded intercellular size variation, and derive closed-form expressions for this variation in terms of underlying model parameters. Finally, we discuss how different organisms have adopted the above strategies for maintaining cell size homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs (sRNA-seq) is a popular method used to discover and annotate microRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and Piwi-associated RNAs (piRNAs). One of the key steps in sRNA-seq data analysis is alignment to a reference genome. sRNA-seq libraries often have a high proportion of reads which align to multiple genomic locations, which makes determining their true loci of origin difficult. Commonly used sRNA-seq alignment methods result in either very low precision (choosing an alignment at random) or sensitivity (ignoring multi-mapping reads). Here, we describe and test an sRNA-seq alignment strategy that uses local genomic context to guide decisions on proper placements of multi-mapped sRNA-seq reads. Tests using simulated sRNA-seq data demonstrated that this local-weighting method outperforms other alignment strategies using three different plant genomes. Experimental analyses with real sRNA-seq data also indicate superior performance of local-weighting methods for both plant miRNAs and heterochromatic siRNAs. The local-weighting methods we have developed are implemented as part of the sRNA-seq analysis program ShortStack, which is freely available under a general public license. Improved genome alignments of sRNA-seq data should increase the quality of downstream analyses and genome annotation efforts.\\n\\nArticle SummaryHigh-throughput sequencing of small RNAs (sRNA-seq) is a frequently used technique in the study of small RNAs. Alignment to a reference genome is a key step in processing sRNA-seq libraries, but suffers from enormous rates of multi-mapping reads. Current methods for sRNA-seq alignment either place these reads randomly or ignore them, both of which distort downstream analyses. Here, we describe a locality-based weighting approach to make better decisions of placement of multi-mapped sRNA-seq data, and test our implementation of this method. We find that our method gives superior performance in terms of placing multi-mapped sRNA-seq data.

    "abstract": "There is a common intuition in biology that strict laws are very difficult to be found. Still, there are recurrent patterns in nature, suggesting broad generalizations and understanding of phenomena. The problem is that many generalizations in biology, especially in the form of correlations, might be decoupled from causality, weakening their power of explanation. Here, I bring an example on the Species-Area Relationship (SAR). The SAR is a well-known generalization in biology. The recurrent pattern states a positive relationship between area size and species richness. Understanding the mechanisms why there is a correlation between area and diversity remains a major challenge. I suggest an explicitly focus on mechanistic explanations for the SAR. I propose to use the integration, comparison and interpretation of other (associated or secondary) natural patterns in the searching for causal explanations. Area per se might not account for causality in species diversification or absolute species richness in larger regions. Biotic and abiotic factors of a given area might be studied in order to discover the causal underpinnings of the SAR.",

    "abstract": "A key to understanding visual cognition is to determine where, when and how brain responses reflect the processing of the specific visual features that modulate categorization behavior--the what. The N170 is the earliest Event-Related Potential (ERP) that preferentially responds to faces. Here, we demonstrate that a paradigmatic shift is necessary to interpret the N170 as the product of an information processing network that dynamically codes and transfers face features across hemispheres, rather than as a local stimulus-driven event. Reverse-correlation methods coupled with information-theoretic analyses revealed that visibility of the eyes influences face detection behavior. The N170 initially reflects coding of the behaviorally relevant eye contralateral to the sensor, followed by a causal communication of the other eye from the other hemisphere. These findings demonstrate that the deceptively simple N170 ERP hides a complex network information processing mechanism involving initial coding and subsequent cross-hemispheric transfer of visual features.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdvances in DNA sequencing have made gene testing fast and affordable, but adaptation of clinical services to capitalise on this for patient benefit has been slow. Ovarian cancer exemplifies limitations of current systems and potential benefits of increased gene testing. Approximately 15% of ovarian cancer patients have a germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (collectively termed  BRCA) and this has substantial implications for their personal management and that of their relatives. However, in most countries implementation of BRCA testing in ovarian cancer has been inconsistent and largely unsuccessful.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed a mainstream pathway in which BRCA testing was undertaken by cancer team members after 30 minutes online training. Patients with a mutation were sent a genetic appointment with their results. Cascade testing to relatives was performed via standard clinical genetic procedures.\\n\\nFindings207 women with ovarian cancer were offered gene testing through the mainstream pathway and all accepted. 33 (16%) had a BRCA mutation. The result informed management of 79% (121/154) women with active disease including 97% (32/33) women with a mutation. All mutation-positive women and ~3.5 relatives per family have been seen in genetics. Patient and clinician feedback was very positive. >95% found the pathway to be simple and effective. The pathway offers considerable reduction in time (~5-fold) and resource requirements (~13-fold) compared to the traditional genetic pathway. We estimate it would deliver {pound}2.6M NHS cost savings per year, and would allow implementation of national testing recommendations with existing infrastructure.\\n\\nInterpretationMainstream genetic testing is effective, efficient and patient-centred and offers a mechanism for large-scale implementation of BRCA gene testing in cancer patients.

    "abstract": "The formation of an allopolyploid species involves the merger of two genomes with separate evolutionary histories. In allopolyploids, genes derived from one progenitor species are often expressed at higher levels than those from the other progenitor. It has been suggested that this could be due to differences in transposable element (TE) content among progenitors, as silencing of TEs can affect expression of nearby genes. Here, we examine the role of TEs for expression biases in the widespread allotetraploid Capsella bursa-pastoris and in diploid F1 hybrids generated by crossing Capsella orientalis and Capsella rubella, two close relatives of the progenitors of C. bursa-pastoris. As C. rubella harbors more TEs than C. orientalis, we expect C. orientalis alleles to be expressed at higher levels if TE content is key for expression biases. To test this hypothesis, we quantified expression biases at approximately 5800 genes in flower buds and leaves, while correcting for read mapping biases using genomic data. While three of four C. bursa-pastoris accessions exhibited a shift toward higher relative expression of C. orientalis alleles, the fourth C. bursa-pastoris accession had the opposite direction of expression bias, as did diploid F1 hybrids. Associations between TE polymorphism and expression bias were weak, and the effect of TEs on expression bias was small. These results suggest that differences in TE content alone cannot fully explain expression biases in these species. Future studies should investigate the role of differences in TE silencing efficacy, as well as a broader set of other factors. Our results are important for a more general understanding of the role of TEs for cis-regulatory evolution in plants.",

The model, originally proposed by Gong and Robinson [36], is known to support stationary and travelling bumps of localised activity. We pose the model on a ring and study the existence and stability of these patterns in various limits using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. In a purely deterministic version of the model, posed on a continuum, we construct bumps and travelling waves analytically using standard interface methods from neural fields theory. In a stochastic version with Heaviside firing rate, we construct approximate analytical probability mass functions associated with bumps and travelling waves. In the full stochastic model posed on a discrete lattice, where a coarse analytic description is unavailable, we compute patterns and their linear stability using equation-free methods. The lifting procedure used in the coarse time-stepper is informed by the analysis in the deterministic and stochastic limits. In all settings, we identify the synaptic profile as a mesoscopic variable, and the width of the corresponding activity set as a macroscopic variable. Stationary and travelling bumps have similar meso- and macroscopic profiles, but different microscopic structure, hence we propose lifting operators which use microscopic motifs to disambiguate between them. We provide numerical evidence that waves are supported by a combination of high synaptic gain and long refractory times, while meandering bumps are elicited by short refractory times.",

Recent data suggests RNA nucleases also affect genome stability programs and act along DNA repair pathways.

We show that Nol12 is required for a key step in ribosomal RNA processing, separating large and small subunit precursors at site 2, rerouting ribosome biogenesis via an alternative pathway in its absence to ensure ribosome production. Furthermore, loss of Nol12 results in increased oxidized DNA levels followed by a rapid p53-independent ATR-Chk1-mediated apoptotic response, suggesting a role for Nol12 in the prevention or resolution of oxidative DNA damage. Identification of a complex Nol12 interactome, which includes NONO, Dhx9 and DNA-PK, further supports its diverse functions in RNA metabolism and DNA maintenance, establishing Nol12 as a multifunctional endonuclease.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is expected to increase fire activity and woody plant encroachment in arctic and alpine landscapes. However, the extent to which these increases interact to affect the structure, function and composition of alpine ecosystems is largely unknown. Here we use field surveys and experimental manipulations to examine how warming and fire affect recruitment, seedling growth and seedling survival in four dominant Australian alpine shrubs. We found that fire increased establishment of shrub seedlings by as much as 33-fold. Experimental warming also doubled growth rates of tall shrub seedlings and could potentially increase their survival. By contrast, warming had no effect on shrub recruitment, post-fire tussock regeneration, or how tussock grass affected shrub seedling growth and survival. These findings indicate that warming, coupled with more frequent or severe fires, will likely result in an increase in the cover and abundance of evergreen shrubs. Given shrubs are one of the most flammable components in alpine and tundra environments, warming is likely to strengthen an existing feedback between woody species abundance and fire in these ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "For over a century, a fundamental objective in infection biology research has been to understand the molecular processes contributing to the origin and perpetuation of epidemics. Divergent hypotheses have emerged concerning the extent to which environmental events or pathogen evolution dominates in these processes. Remarkably few studies bear on this important issue. Based on population pathogenomic analysis of 1200 Streptococcus pyogenes type emm89 infection isolates, we report that a series of horizontal gene transfer events produced a new pathogenic genotype with increased ability to cause infection, leading to an epidemic wave of disease on at least two continents. In the aggregate, these and other genetic changes substantially remodeled the transcriptomes of the evolved progeny, causing extensive differential expression of virulence genes and altered pathogen - host interaction, including enhanced immune evasion. Our findings delineate the precise molecular genetic changes that occurred and enhance our understanding of the evolutionary processes that contribute to the emergence and persistence of epidemically successful pathogen clones. The data have significant implications for understanding bacterial epidemics and translational research efforts to blunt their detrimental effects.\\n\\nImportanceThe confluence of studies of molecular events underlying pathogen strain emergence, evolutionary genetic processes mediating altered virulence, and epidemics is in its infancy. Although understanding these events is necessary to develop new or improved strategies to protect health, surprisingly few studies have addressed this issue, in particular at the comprehensive population genomic level. Herein we establish that substantial remodeling of the transcriptome of the human-specific pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes by horizontal gene flow and other evolutionary genetic changes is a central factor in precipitating and perpetuating epidemic disease. The data unambiguously show that the key outcome of these molecular events is evolution of a new, more virulent pathogenic genotype. Our findings provide new understanding of epidemic disease.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel method and computational tool, Strawberry, for transcript reconstruction and quantification from paired-end RNA-seq data under the guidance of genome alignment and independent of gene annotation. Strawberry achieves this through disentangling assembly and quantification in a sequential manner. The application of a fast flow network algorithm for assembly speeds up the construction of a parsimonious set of transcripts. The resulting reduced data representation improves the efficiency of expression-level quantification. Strawberry leverages the speed and accuracy of transcript assembly and quantification in such a way that processing 10 million simulated reads (after alignment) requires only 90 seconds using a single thread while achieving over 92% correlation with the ground truth, making it the state-of-the-art method. Strawberry outperforms Cufflinks and StringTie, the two other leading methods, in many aspects, including the number of corrected assembled transcripts and the correlation with the ground truth of simulated RNA-seq data. Availability: Strawberry is written in C++11, and is available as open source software at https://github.com/ruolin/Strawberry under the GPLv3 license.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFor most animals, survival depends on rapid detection of rewarding objects, but search for an object surrounded by many others is known to be difficult and time consuming. However, there is neuronal evidence for robust and rapid differentiation of objects based on their reward history in primates (Hikosaka et al., 2014). We hypothesized that such robust coding should support efficient search for high-value objects, similar to a pop-out mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we let subjects (n=4, macaque monkeys) view a large number of complex objects with consistently biased rewards with variable training durations (1, 5 or >30days). Following training, subjects searched for a high-value object (Good) among a variable number of low-value objects (Bad). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that Good objects were accurately and quickly targeted, often by a single and direct saccade with a very short latency (<200ms). The dependence of search times on display size reduced significantly with longer reward training, giving rise to a more efficient search (40ms/item to 16ms/item). This object-finding skill showed a large capacity for value-biased objects and was maintained in the long-term memory with no interference from reward learning with other objects. Such object-finding skill, particularly its large capacity and its long term retention, would be crucial for maximizing rewards and biological fitness throughout life where many objects are experienced continuously and/or intermittently.\\n\\nSignificance StatementVisual objects that have become associated with reward in the past, can grab our attention even when we are not looking for them. Here, we show that this powerful attentional mechanism serves an important biological purpose: it allows one to quickly find valuable objects regardless of the number of other visual distractors present. Efficient search has long been thought to be primarily limited to objects with certain visually conspicuities (Wolfe and Horowitz, 2004). Our result shows that long-term and consistently biased reward can achieve search efficiencies that are independent of object visual features. This search efficiency is highly scalable as it develops for a large number of objects with no apparent interference between objects and is maintained in long-term memory.",

    "abstract": "We begin by reviewing the statistical framework of information theory as applicable to neuroimaging data analysis. A major factor hindering wider adoption of this framework in neuroimaging is the difficulty of estimating information theoretic quantities in practice. We present a novel estimation technique that combines the statistical theory of copulas with the closed form solution for the entropy of Gaussian variables. This results in a general, computationally efficient, flexible, and robust multivariate statistical framework that provides effect sizes on a common meaningful scale, allows for unified treatment of discrete, continuous, uni-and multi-dimensional variables, and enables direct comparisons of representations from behavioral and brain responses across any recording modality. We validate the use of this estimate as a statistical test within a neuroimaging context, considering both discrete stimulus classes and continuous stimulus features. We also present examples of analyses facilitated by these developments, including application of multivariate analyses to MEG planar magnetic field gradients, and pairwise temporal interactions in evoked EEG responses. We show the benefit of considering the instantaneous temporal derivative together with the raw values of M/EEG signals as a multivariate response, how we can separately quantify modulations of amplitude and direction for vector quantities, and how we can measure the emergence of novel information over time in evoked responses. Open-source Matlab and Python code implementing the new methods accompanies this article.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LINovel estimator for mutual information and other information theoretic quantities\\nC_LIO_LIProvides general, efficient, flexible and robust multivariate statistical framework\\nC_LIO_LIValidated statistical performance on EEG and MEG data\\nC_LIO_LIApplications to spectral power and phase, 2D magnetic field gradients, temporal derivatives\\nC_LIO_LIInteraction information relates information content in different responses\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "It is implicitly assumed that the microbial DNA recovered from soil originates from living cells. However, because relic DNA (DNA from dead cells) can persist in soil for weeks to years, it could impact DNA-based analyses of microbial diversity. We examined a wide range of soils and found that, on average, 40% of prokaryotic and fungal DNA was derived from the relic DNA pool. Relic DNA inflated the observed prokaryotic and fungal diversity by as much as 55%, and caused misestimation of taxon abundances, including taxa integral to key ecosystem processes. These findings imply that relic DNA can obscure treatment effects, spatiotemporal patterns, and relationships between taxa and environmental conditions. Moreover, relic DNA may represent a historical record of microbes formerly living in soil.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummarySoils can harbor substantial amounts of DNA from dead microbial cells; this  relic DNA inflates estimates of microbial diversity and obscures assessments of community structure.",
