    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research is routinely criticized for being statistically underpowered due to characteristically small sample sizes and much larger sample sizes are being increasingly recommended. Additionally, various sources of artifact inherent in fMRI data can have detrimental impact on effect size estimates and statistical power. Here we show how specific removal of non-BOLD artifacts can improve effect size estimation and statistical power in task-fMRI contexts, with particular application to the social-cognitive domain of mentalizing/theory of mind. Non-BOLD variability identification and removal is achieved in a biophysical and statistically principled manner by combining multi-echo fMRI acquisition and independent components analysis (ME-ICA). Group-level effect size estimates on two different mentalizing tasks were enhanced by ME-ICA at a median rate of 24% in regions canonically associated with mentalizing, while much more substantial boosts (40-149%) were observed in non-canonical cerebellar areas. This effect size boosting is primarily a consequence of reduction of non-BOLD noise at the subject-level, which then translates into consequent reductions in between-subject variance at the group-level. Power simulations demonstrate that enhanced effect size enables highly-powered studies at traditional sample sizes. Cerebellar effects observed after applying ME-ICA may be unobservable with conventional imaging at traditional sample sizes. Thus, ME-ICA allows for principled design-agnostic non-BOLD artifact removal that can substantially improve effect size estimates and statistical power in task-fMRI contexts. ME-ICA could help issues regarding statistical power and non-BOLD noise and enable potential for novel discovery of aspects of brain organization that are currently under-appreciated and not well understood.",

    "abstract": "A critical assumption of gene expression analysis is that mRNA abundances broadly correlate with protein abundance, but these two are often imperfectly correlated. Some of the discrepancy can be accounted for by two important mRNA features: codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. We present a new global factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, and provide evidence that avoidance increases translational efficiency. We also demonstrate a strong selection for avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes, and that these have a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we demonstrate that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance. Therefore, taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance.",

Behavioural plasticity in response to internal or external cues can therefore generate potentially significant heterogeneity in infection. We tested whether Drosophila melanogaster exhibits infection avoidance behaviour during foraging, and whether this behaviour is modified by prior exposure to Drosophila C Virus (DCV) and by the risk of DCV encounter. We examined two measures of infection avoidance: (1) the motivation to feed in the presence of an infection risk and (2) the preference to feed on a clean food source over a potentially infectious source. While we found no clear evidence for preference of clean food sources over potentially infectious ones, female flies were less motivated to feed when presented with a risk of encountering DCV, but only if they had been previously exposed to the virus. We discuss the relevance of behavioural plasticity during foraging for host fitness and pathogen spread.",

    "abstract": "Young, or newly evolved, genes arise ubiquitously across the tree of life, and can rapidly acquire novel functions that influence a diverse array of biological processes1. Previous work identified a young regulatory gene in Drosophila, Zeus, which diverged rapidly from its parent Caf40 and took on roles in the male reproductive system. This neofunctionalization was accompanied by differential binding of the Zeus protein to loci throughout the Drosophila melanogaster genome2. However, the way in which new DNA-binding proteins acquire and coevolve with their targets in the genome is not understood. Here, by comparing Zeus ChIP-seq data from D. melanogaster and D. simulans to the ancestral Caf40 binding events from D. yakuba, a species that diverged before the duplication event, we find a dynamic pattern in which Zeus binding rapidly co-evolved with a previously unknown DNA motif under the influence of positive selection. Interestingly, while both copies of Zeus acquired targets at male-biased and testis-specific genes, D. melanogaster and D. simulans proteins have specialized binding on different chromosomes, a pattern echoed in the evolution of the associated motif. Our results suggest that evolution of young regulatory genes can be coupled to substantial rewiring of the transcriptional networks into which they integrate, even over short evolutionary timescales. Our results thus uncover dynamic, genome-wide evolutionary processes associated with new genes.",

    "abstract": "Mutation rate is a crucial evolutionary parameter that has typically been treated as a constant in population genetic analyses. However, mutation rate is likely to vary among co-existing individuals within a population, due to genetic polymorphisms, heterogeneous environmental influences, and random physiological fluctuations. We explore the consequences of such mutation rate heterogeneity in a model allowing an arbitrary distribution of mutation rate among individuals, either with or without inheritance. We find that variation of mutation rate about the mean results in a higher probability of producing zero or many simultaneous mutations on a genome. Moreover, it increases the frequency of higher order mutants even under ongoing mutation and selection. We gain a quantitative understanding of how this frequency depends on moments of the mutation rate distribution and selection coefficients. In particular, in a two-locus model, heterogeneity leads to a relative increase in double mutant frequency proportional to the squared coefficient of variation of the mutation rate. Relative effect sizes increase with the number of loci. Finally, this clustering of deleterious mutations into fewer individuals results in a higher population mean fitness. Our results imply that mutation rate heterogeneity allows a population to maintain a higher level of adaptedness to its current environment, while simultaneously harboring greater genetic diversity in the standing variation, which could be crucial for future adaptation to a new environment. Our results also have implications for interpreting mutation rate estimates and mutant frequencies in data.",

    "abstract": "Proteins localized to mitochondria by a carboxyl-terminal tail anchor (TA) play roles in apoptosis, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial protein import. To reveal characteristics of TAs that may be important for mitochondrial targeting, we focused our attention upon the TA of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fis1 protein. Specifically, we generated a library of Fis1p TA variants fused to the Gal4 transcription factor, then, using next-generation sequencing, revealed which Fis1p TA mutations inhibited membrane insertion and allowed Gal4p activity in the nucleus. Prompted by our global analysis, we subsequently analyzed the ability of individual Fis1p TA mutants to localize to mitochondria. Our findings suggest that the membrane-associated domain of Fis1p TA may be bipartite in nature, and we encountered evidence that the positively charged patch at the carboxyl-terminus of Fis1p is required for both membrane insertion and organelle specificity. Furthermore, lengthening or shortening the Fis1 TA by up to three amino acids did not inhibit mitochondrial targeting, arguing against a model in which TA length directs insertion of TAs at specific organelles. Most importantly, positively charged residues were more acceptable at several positions within the membrane-associated domain of the Fis1p TA than negatively charged residues. These findings, emerging from the first high-resolution analysis of an organelle targeting sequence by deep mutational scanning, provide strong, in vivo evidence that lysine and arginine can \\\"snorkel,\\\" or become stably incorporated within a lipid bilayer by placing terminal charges of their side chains at the membrane interface.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

H. pylori induce inflammation, gastroenteritis, and ulcers, which is associated with significant morbidity and may be linked to stomach cancer in certain individuals. Motility is an essential virulence factor for H. pylori, allowing it to migrate toward and invade the epithelial lining of the stomach to shelter it from the harsh environment of the stomach. H. pylori senses pH gradients and use polar flagella to move towards the epithelium where the pH approaches neutrality. However, its chemotaxis behaviors are incompletely understood. Previous in vitro tests examining the response of H. pylori to chemical gradients have been subjected to substantial limitations. To more accurately mimic/modulate the cellular microenvironment, a nanoporous microfluidic device was used to monitor the real time chemotactic activity of single cell of H. pylori in response to urea. The results showed that microfluidic method is a promising alternative for precisely studying chemotactic behavior of bacteria.",

Bio-functional layers comprised of chitosan and protein-A molecules were implemented at the interface of sensor element and antibodies, which synergistically enriched the bio-activity of immobilized antibodies for the immune complex formation. The differential pulse voltammetric signals resulted from the developed immunosensor platform exhibited a good correlation (R2= 0.9978 for H1N1 and R2=0.9997 for H5N1) for the wide range of target concentrations (25 to 500 pM).

MSI, but not MSS, cancers demonstrate unequal mutation rates between the leading and the lagging strands. The direction of strand asymmetry in MSI cancers matches that observed in cancers with mutated exonuclease domain of polymerase {delta}, indicating that polymerase {delta} contributes more mutations than its leading-strand counterpart, polymerase {varepsilon}.

    "abstract": "Humans prioritize different semantic qualities of a complex stimulus depending on their behavioral goals. These semantic features are encoded in distributed neural populations, yet it is unclear how attention might operate across these distributed representations. To address this, we presented participants with naturalistic video clips of animals behaving in their natural environments while the participants attended to either behavior or taxonomy. We used models of representational geometry to investigate how attentional allocation affects the distributed neural representation of animal behavior and taxonomy. Attending to animal behavior transiently increased the discriminability of distributed population codes for observed actions in anterior intraparietal, pericentral, and ventral temporal cortices. Attending to animal taxonomy while viewing the same stimuli increased the discriminability of distributed animal category representations in ventral temporal cortex. For both tasks, attention selectively enhanced the discriminability of response patterns along behaviorally relevant dimensions. These findings suggest that behavioral goals alter how the brain extracts semantic features from the visual world. Attention effectively disentangles population responses for downstream read-out by sculpting representational geometry in late-stage perceptual areas.",

The newly discovered importance and ubiquity of host-associated microorganisms is now stimulating work on the roles that microbes can play in animal speciation. We previously synthesized the literature and advanced concepts of speciation by symbiosis with notable attention to hybrid sterility and lethality. Here, we review recent studies and relevant data on microbes as players in host behavior and behavioral isolation, emphasizing the patterns seen in these analyses and highlighting areas worthy of additional exploration. We conclude that the role of microbial symbionts in behavior and speciation is gaining exciting traction, and the holobiont and hologenome concepts afford an evolving intellectual framework to promote research and intellectual exchange between disciplines such as behavior, microbiology, genetics, symbiosis and speciation. Given the increasing centrality of microbiology in macroscopic life, microbial symbiosis is arguably the most neglected aspect of animal and plant speciation, and studying it should yield a better understanding of the origin of species.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDSelective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM a type of light-sheet microscopy) involves focusing a thin sheet of laser light through a specimen at right angles to the objective lens. As only the thin section of the specimen at the focal plane of the lens is illuminated, out of focus light is naturally absent and toxicity due to light (phototoxicity) is greatly reduced enabling longer term live imaging. OpenSPIM is an open access platform (Pitrone et al. 2013 and OpenSPIM.org) created to give new users step-by-step instructions on building a basic configuration of a SPIM microscope, which can in principle be adapted and upgraded to each laboratorys own requirements and budget. Here we describe our own experience with the process of designing, building, configuring and using an OpenSPIM for our research into the early development of the polyclad flatworm Maritigrella crozieri - a non-model animal.\\n\\nRESULTSOur OpenSPIM builds on the standard design with the addition of two colour laser illumination for simultaneous detection of two probes/molecules and dual sided illumination, which provides more even signal intensity across a specimen. Our OpenSPIM provides high resolution 3d images and time lapse recordings, and we demonstrate the use of two colour lasers and the benefits of two color dual-sided imaging. We used our microscope to study the development of the embryo of the polyclad flatworm Maritigrella crozieri. The capabilities of our microscope are demonstrated by our ability to record the stereotypical spiral cleavage pattern of Maritigrella with high-speed multi-view time lapse imaging. 3D and 4D (3D + time) reconstruction of early development from these data is possible using image registration and deconvolution tools provided as part of the open source Fiji platform. We discuss our findings on the pros and cons of a self built microscope.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSWe conclude that home-built microscopes, such as an OpenSPIM, together with the available open source software, such as MicroManager and Fiji, make SPIM accessible to anyone interested in having continuous access to their own light-sheet microscope. However, building an OpenSPIM is not without challenges and an open access microscope is a worthwhile, if significant, investment of time and money. Multi-view 4D microscopy is more challenging than we had expected. We hope that our gained experience during this project will help future OpenSPIM users with similar ambitions.",

    "abstract": "Milk has rich nutritional content packed with fats, proteins and water. It also contains beneficiary and non-beneficiary microbes which account for its short shelf life. Currently cold storage, pasteurization, ultra-high temperature, microfiltration and addition of lactose peroxidase are the methods of choice to control milk spoilage and prolong its shelf life. Their limitations include high energy consumption and loss of variable proportion of heat sensitive nutrients. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticle coated thin film was used in food packaging industry for its antimicrobial property. TiO2 thin films were synthesized by sol gel process; it was characterized with scanning electron microscopy which showed pore size as 5 m and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy which showed metal present in sample is TiO2, zinc and silver. Exposure of raw milk at room temperature to TiO2 thin films doped with zinc or copper for a couple of hours showed zone of inhibition in disc diffusion technique, reduction in acid production. It also showed reduction in optical density indicating inhibition of growth in growth curve analysis, increase in the time required for methylene blue reduction and a five log folds decrease in bacterial count estimated using serial dilution plate count. The present studies were carried out under room temperature and pressure which is an added advantage in terms of energy as well as retention of nutrients. Though TiO2 is insoluble in water one needs to address it toxicity issues and adverse effects if any on the nutritional quality of milk before scaling up the process.",

    "abstract": "In the Avocado Sunblotch Viroid (ASBVd: 249-nt) from the Avsunviroidae family, a symmetric rolling-circle replication operates through an autocatalytic mechanism mediated by hammerhead ribozymes (HHR) embedded in both polarity strands. The concatenated multimeric ASBVd (+) and ASBVd (-) RNAs thus generated are processed by cleavage to unit-length where ASBVd (-) self-cleaves with more efficiency. Absolute scale small angle neutron scattering (SANS) revealed a temperature-dependent dimer association in both ASBVd (-) and its derived 79-nt HHR (-). A joint thermodynamic analysis of SANS and catalytic data indicates the rate-determining step corresponds to the dimer/monomer transition. 2D and 3D models of monomeric and dimeric HHR (-) suggest that the inter-molecular contacts stabilizing the dimer (between HI and HII domains) compete with the intra-molecular ones stabilizing the active conformation of the full-length HHR required for an efficient self-cleavage. Similar competing intra- and inter-molecular contacts are proposed in ASBVd (-) though with a remoter region from an extension of the HI domain.",

    "abstract": "This paper began as an exercise in curiosity - logarithmic spiral designs abound in nature -- in galaxies, flowers, pinecones and on human scalps as whorls. Why are humans the only primates to have whorls on the scalp? Is the formation of scalp whorls mechanical or genetic? A mechanical theory has long been postulated- the mechanical theory suggests that hair whorl patterning is determined by the tension on the epidermis during rapid expansion of the cranium while the hair follicle is growing downwards - however, this has never before been experimentally proven conclusively. We found, that under certain conditions, we were able to experimentally recreate spirals on the scalp to demonstrate that the basis of scalp whorls is indeed mechanical - and that logarithmic spirals are indeed natures own design for rapid expansion of organic tissues. Given our experiments only created whorls when certain conditions were satisfied (and not in others), they have given us great insight into the mechanical formation of skin whorls and the physiology of skin stretch. We believe that these findings will lead to many more advances in understanding skin dynamics and indeed the behavior of any living tissue when confronted by stretch. As a corollary, the application of the results of these studies have led us to the discovery of a new surgical technique for closure of scalp defects using the golden spiral pattern, and this will be the subject of a separate paper.",
