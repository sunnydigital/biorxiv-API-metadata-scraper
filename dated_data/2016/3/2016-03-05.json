    "abstract": "Motivation: Public archives contain thousands of trillions of bases of valuable sequencing data. More than 40% of the Sequence Read Archive is human data protected by provisions such as dbGaP To analyze dbGaP-protected data, researchers must typically work with IT administrators and signing officials to ensure all levels of security are implemented at their institution. This is a major obstacle, impeding reproducibility and reducing the utility of archived data.\\n\\nResults: We present a protocol and software tool for analyzing protected data in a commercial cloud. The protocol, Rail-dbGaP, is applicable to any tool running on Amazon Web Services Elastic MapReduce. The tool, Rail-RNA v0.2, is a spliced aligner for RNA- seq data, which we demonstrate by running on 9,662 samples from the dbGaP-protected GTEx consortium dataset. The Rail-dbGaP protocol makes explicit for the first time the steps an investigator must take to develop Elastic MapReduce pipelines that analyze dbGaP-protected data in a manner compliant with NIH guidelines. Rail-RNA automates implementation of the protocol, making it easy for typical biomedical investigators to study protected RNA-seq data, regardless of their local IT resources or expertise.\\n\\nAvailability: Rail-RNA is available from http://rail.bio. Technical details on the Rail-dbGaP protocol as well as an implementation walkthrough are available at https://github.com/nellore/rail-dbgap. Detailed instructions on running Rail-RNA on dbGaP-protected data using Amazon Web Services are available at http://docs.rail.bio/dbgap/.\\n\\nContact: anellore@gmail.com, langmea@cs.jhu.edu",

    "abstract": "Organophosphate poisoning represents a major and growing global health problem especially in the developing countries and cardiotoxicity is the major cause of death. Thus, a compelling need to develop novel low cost efficacious agents to manage this condition.\\n\\nObjectiveTo evaluate the methanol extract of Withania somnifera as a pre-treatment agent in the prevention of the cardiotoxic effects of diazinon in Sprague Dawley rats\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsTwenty one (21) adult rats were randomized to receive 200 mg/kg methanol extract of Withania somnifera (test group), vehicle (negative control) or 200 g/kg Neostigmine as pre-treatment 30 minutes prior to the oral administration of 200 mg/kg Diazinon. Baseline and post-treatment electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded by the Powerlab data acquisition system (ML865 AD instruments, Sydney, Australia). The experimental data were expressed as median {+/-} the inter-quartile range and analysed using the Kruskal - Wallis non-parametric test and followed by Mann-Whitney U post hoc test in cases of significance, which was set at p < 0.05. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17 software was used for analysis.\\n\\nResultsPre-treatment with the methanol extract of W. somnifera had significant effect on the following diazinon-induced electrocardiographic changes; RR interval (0.026 (0.007 - 0.065) vs. 0.035 (0.019 - 0.050) vs. 0.090 (0.071 - 0.01), p = 0.031),heart rate (-54.235 (-115.317 - (-19.857)) vs. --96.136 (-96.472 - (-43.879)) vs. --174.361 (-189.775 - (-129.469)), p = 0.014), PR interval (0.006 (0.004 - 0.008) vs. 0.003 (0.001 - 0.004) vs. 0.009 (0.006 - 0.015), p = 0.019), QRS interval (0.005 (0.001 - 0.008) vs. --0.002 (-0.005 - 0.001) vs. 0.007 (0.003 - 0.011), p = 0.023) and ST height (-34.830 (-63.578 - 4.215) vs. --22.330 (-38.383- (-4.159)) vs. --73.156 (-214.022- (-52.449)), p = 0.023). It however had no significant effect on the QTc interval changes (-0.005 (-0.011 - 0.003) vs. --0.005 (-0.015 - 0.065) vs. --0.021 (-0.060- (-0.006)), p = 0.174).\\n\\nConclusionThe efficacy of pre-treatment with the methanol extract of Withania somnifera was comparable to that of pre-treatment with Neostigmine a commonly used carbamate drug. Thus, it is a potentially viable low cost treatment option for organophosphate poisoning in resource-limited settings.",

    "abstract": "Congenital cataract is a rare but severe paediatric visual impediment, often caused by variants in one of several crystallin genes that produce the bulk of structural proteins in lens. Here we describe a pedigree with autosomal dominant isolated congenital cataract and linkage to the crystallin gene cluster on chromosome 22. No rare single nucleotide variants or short indels were identified by whole-exome sequencing, yet copy number variant analysis revealed a duplication spanning both CRYBB1 and CRYBA4. While the CRYBA4 duplication was complete, the CRYBB1 duplication was not, with the duplicated CRYBB1 product predicted to create a gain of function allele. This association suggests a new genetic mechanism for the development of isolated congenital cataract.\\n\\nGrant informationSupported by the National Health and Medical Research Council\\n\\nConflict of interestthe authors declare no conflict of interest.",

    "abstract": "The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been proposed to contribute to circadian regulation of sleepiness by increasing in the blood at night to signal for sleepiness. Earlier studies have reported diurnal variations of IL-6, but phase estimates are conflicting. We have therefore performed a meta-analysis on the diurnal variation of circulating IL-6. Studies were included if they reported circulating levels of IL-6 recorded at least twice within 24 hours in the same individual. A systematic search resulted in the inclusion of 43 studies with 56 datasets, for a total of 1100 participants. Individual participant data were available from 4 datasets with a total of 56 participants. Mixed-effects meta-regression modelling confirmed that IL-6 varied across the day, the most conspicuous effect being a trough in the morning. These results stand in contrast to earlier findings of a peak in the evening or night, and suggest that diurnal variation should be taken into account in order to avoid confounding in studies of IL-6 in plasma or serum.",

    "abstract": "Conventional methods for the detection of bacterial infection such as DNA or immunoassays are either expensive, time consuming, or not definitive; thus may not provide all the information sought by the medical professionals. In particular, it is difficult to obtain information about viability or drug effectiveness, which are crucial to formulate a treatment. Bacterial culture test is the \\\"gold standard\\\" because it is inexpensive and does not require extensive sample preparation, and most importantly, provides all the necessary information sought by healthcare professionals, such as bacterial presence, viability and drug effectiveness. These conventional culture methods, however, have a long turnaround time: anywhere between 1 day to 4 weeks. Here, we solve this problem by monitoring the growth of bacteria in thousands of nanowells simultaneously to identify its presence in the sample and its viability, faster. The segmentation of a sample with low bacterial concentration into thousands of nanoliter wells digitizes the samples and increases the effective concentration in those wells that contain bacteria. We monitor the metabolism of aerobic bacteria by using an oxygen sensitive fluorophore, ruthenium tris (2,2-diprydl) dichloride hexahydrate (RTDP) that allows us to monitor the dissolved oxygen concentration in the nanowells. Using E.Coli K12 as a model pathogen, we demonstrate that the detection time of E.coli can be as fast as 35-60 minutes with sample concentrations varying from 104(62 minutes for detection), 106 (42 minutes) and 108 cells/mL (38 minutes). More importantly, we also demonstrate that reducing the well size can reduce the time of detection. Finally we show that drug effectiveness information can be obtained in this format by loading the wells with the drug and monitoring the metabolism of the bacteria. The method that we have developed is low cost, simple, requires minimal sample preparation and can potentially be used with a wide variety of samples in resource poor setting to detect bacterial infections such as Tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "Dipsadidae is the most diversified family of snakes, composed of species showing an impressive variety of color patterns. Some species are cryptic whereas others have contrasting patterns comprised by bright colors alternated with darker shades, including particular combinations of vivid colors characteristic of coral snakes (Elapidae). Species with such patterns are thought to be mimics of coral snakes based on their color pattern similarity, predator avoidance of such patterns in field experiments, and the geographical concordance between models and mimics. Here we test whether color patterns associated with coral snake mimicry and contrasting color patterns in general influenced the diversification dynamics of the group. We compile the largest database of color patterns among reptiles to date, with color descriptions for the majority (594 species) of dipsadids. We used trait-dependent diversification models along with extensive simulations to deal with the recently described statistical bias associated with such methods. Despite the apparent survival advantage associated with coral snake mimicry, we show that there is no detectable influence of color types in the dynamics of diversification in Dipsadidae. We discuss insights into the function of color patterns and argue that non-mimic contrasting patterns might serve as pre-adaptations to mimicry of coral snakes.\\n\\nData archival locationBEAST XML file and BiSSE MCMC results: http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.831493\\n\\nR code for analyses and simulations: https://github.com/Caetanods/Dipsadidae_color_evolution",
