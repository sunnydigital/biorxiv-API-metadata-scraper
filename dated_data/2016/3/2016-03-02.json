    "abstract": "The diversity of a persons B- and T-cell repertoires is both clinically important and a key measure of immunological complexity. However, diversity is hard to estimate by current methods, due to inherent uncertainty in the number of B- and T-cell clones that will be missing from a blood or tissue sample by chance (the missing-species problem), inevitable sampling bias, and experimental noise. To solve this problem we developed Recon, a modified maximum-likelihood method that outputs the overall diversity of a repertoire from measurements on a sample. Recon outputs accurate, robust estimates by any of a vast set of complementary diversity measures, including species richness and entropy, at fractional repertoire coverage. It also outputs error bars and power tables, allowing robust comparisons of diversity between individuals and over time. We apply Recon to in silico and experimental immune-repertoire sequencing datasets as proof of principle for measuring diversity in large, complex systems.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral flexibility is considered an important trait for adapting to environmental change, but it is unclear what it is, how it works, and whether it is a problem solving ability. I investigated behavioral flexibility and problem solving abilities experimentally in great-tailed grackles, an invasive species and thus a likely candidate for possessing behavioral flexibility. I found that grackles are behaviorally flexible and good problem solvers, they vary in behavioral flexibility across contexts, flexibility did not correlate with problem solving ability, and those that are more flexible did not necessarily use more learning strategies. It appears that behavioral flexibility can be an independent trait that varies across contexts. Maintaining such a high level of variation could be a mechanism underlying successful species invasions. These results highlight the need to investigate how individuals use behavior to react to changing environments.",

    "abstract": "In outcrossing populations, \\\"Haldanes Sieve\\\" states that recessive beneficial alleles are less likely to fix than dominant ones, because they are less expose to selection when rare. In contrast, selfing organisms are not subject to Haldanes Sieve and are more likely to fix recessive types than outcrossers, as selfing rapidly creates homozygotes, increasing overall selection acting on mutations. However, longer homozygous tracts in selfers also reduces the ability of recombination to create new genotypes. It is unclear how these two effects influence overall adaptation rates in partially selfing organisms. Here, we calculate the fixation probability of beneficial alleles if there is an existing selective sweep in the population. We consider both the potential loss of the second beneficial mutation if it has a weaker advantage than the first, and the possible replacement of the initial allele if the second mutant is fitter. Overall, loss of weaker adaptive alleles during a first selective sweep has a larger impact on preventing fixation of both mutations in highly selfing organisms. Furthermore, the presence of linked mutations has two opposing effects on Haldanes Sieve. First, recessive mutants are disproportionally likely to be lost in outcrossers, so it is likelier that dominant mutations will fix. Second, with elevated rates of adaptive mutation, selective interference annuls the advantage in selfing organisms of not suffering from Haldanes Sieve; outcrossing organisms are more able to fix weak beneficial mutations of any dominance value. Overall, weakened recombination effects can greatly limit adaptation in selfing organisms.",

    "abstract": "The social network structure of animal populations has major implications for survival, reproductive success, sexual selection, and pathogen transmission of individuals. But as of yet, no general theory of social network structure exists that can explain the diversity of social networks observed in nature, and serve as a null model for detecting species and population-specific factors. Here we propose a simple and generally applicable model of social network structure. We consider the emergence of network structure as a result of social inheritance, in which newborns are likely to bond with maternal contacts, and via forming bonds randomly. We compare model output to data from several species, showing that it can generate networks with properties such as those observed in real social systems. Our model demonstrates that important observed properties of social networks, including heritability of network position or assortative associations, can be understood as consequences of social inheritance.",

    "abstract": "Tardigrades are meiofaunal ecdysozoans that are key to understanding the origins of Arthropoda. Many species of Tardigrada can survive extreme conditions through cryptobiosis. In a recent paper (Boothby TC et al (2015) Evidence for extensive horizontal gene transfer from the draft genome of a tardigrade. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112:15976-15981) the authors concluded that the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini had an unprecedented proportion (17%) of genes originating through functional horizontal gene transfer (fHGT), and speculated that fHGT was likely formative in the evolution of cryptobiosis. We independently sequenced the genome of H. dujardini. As expected from whole-organism DNA sampling, our raw data contained reads from non-target genomes. Filtering using metagenomics approaches generated a draft H. dujardini genome assembly of 135 Mb with superior assembly metrics to the previously published assembly. Additional microbial contamination likely remains. We found no support for extensive fHGT. Among 23,021 gene predictions we identified 0.2% strong candidates for fHGT from bacteria, and 0.2% strong candidates for fHGT from non-metazoan eukaryotes. Cross-comparison of assemblies showed that the overwhelming majority of HGT candidates in the Boothby et al. genome derived from contaminants. We conclude that fHGT into H. dujardini accounts for at most 1-2% of genes and that the proposal that one sixth of tardigrade genes originate from functional HGT events is an artefact of undetected contamination.",

Here we introduce a computationally scalable and widely applicable statistical method (SEER) for the identification of sequence elements that are significantly enriched in a phenotype of interest. SEER is applicable to even tens of thousands of genomes by counting variable-length k-mers using a distributed string-mining algorithm. Robust options are provided for association analysis that also correct for the clonal population structure of bacteria. Using large collections of genomes of the major human pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, SEER identifies relevant previously characterised resistance determinants for several antibiotics and discovers potential novel factors related to the invasiveness of S. pyogenes. We thus demonstrate that our method can answer important biologically and medically relevant questions.",

Here, we show that evolution along the fungal lineage was punctuated by the early acquisition and entrainment of the SBF transcription factor through horizontal gene transfer. Cell cycle evolution in the fungal ancestor then proceeded through a hybrid network containing both SBF and its ancestral animal counterpart E2F, which is still maintained in many basal fungi. We hypothesize that a virally-derived SBF may have initially hijacked cell cycle control by activating transcription via the cis-regulatory elements targeted by the ancestral cell cycle regulator E2F, much like extant viral oncogenes. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that SBF can regulate promoters with E2F binding sites in budding yeast.",

    "abstract": "There are global increases in the use of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART), guided by clinical benefits of early ART initiation, and the efficacy of treatment as prevention of transmission. Separately, it has been shown theoretically and empirically that HIV virulence can evolve over time. Observed virulence levels may reflect an adaptive balance between infected lifespan and per-contact transmission rate. Critically, the potential effects of widespread ART on HIV virulence are unknown. To predict these effects, we used an agent-based stochastic model to simulate changes in HIV virulence, using set point viral load as a virulence proxy. We calibrated our epidemic model to the prevalence and incidence trends of South Africa. We repeated our analysis using a separate calibration, as a sensitivity analysis, and found that predicted impact of ART on virulence was relatively insensitive to calibration. We explored two ART scenarios, at increasing coverage : ART initiation based on patients reaching a CD4 cell count threshold, or based on time elapsed since infection (a scenario that mimics the \\\"universal testing and treatment\\\" aspirations). We found that HIV virulence is generally unchanged in scenarios of CD4-based initiation. However, with ART initiation based on time since infection, virulence can increase moderately within several years of ART rollout, under high coverage and early treatment initiation, albeit within the context of rapidly shrinking epidemics. Our modeling study suggests that increasing virulence driven by universal test and treat is likely not a major public health concern, but could be monitored in sentinel surveillance, in a manner similar to transmitted drug resistance.",

To investigate the network-level mechanisms that underlie these dynamics, we developed novel computational techniques to fit a deterministic spiking network model directly to multi-neuron recordings from different species, sensory modalities, and behavioral states. The model generated correlated variability without external noise and accurately reproduced the wide variety of activity patterns in our recordings. Analysis of the model parameters suggested that differences in noise correlations across recordings were due primarily to differences in the strength of feedback inhibition. Further analysis of our recordings confirmed that putative inhibitory neurons were indeed more active during desynchronized cortical states with weak noise correlations. Our results demonstrate that network models with intrinsically-generated variability can accurately reproduce the activity patterns observed in multi-neuron recordings and suggest that inhibition modulates the interactions between intrinsic dynamics and sensory inputs to control the strength of noise correlations.",

Building equally complex synthetic circuits in eukaryotes remains difficult, however, because commonly used genetic components leak transcriptionally, do not allow arbitrary interconnections, or do not have digital responses. Here, we designed a new dCas9-Mxi1 based NOR gate architecture in S. cerevisiae that allows arbitrary connectivity and large genetic circuits. Because we used the strong chromatin remodeler Mxi1, our system showed very little leak and exhibits a highly digital response. In particular, we built a combinatorial library of NOR gates that each directly convert guide RNA (gRNA) input signals into gRNA output signals, enabling NOR gates to be \\\"wired\\\" together. We constructed and characterized logic circuits with up to seven independent gRNAs, including repression cascades with up to seven layers. Modeling predicted that the NOR gates have Hill Coefficients of approximately 1.71 {+/-} 0.09, explaining the minimal signal degradation we observed in these deeply layered circuits. Our approach enables the construction of the largest, eukaryotic gene circuits to date and will form the basis for large, synthetic, decision making systems in living cells.",

    "abstract": "Self-assembling filamentous structures made of protein subunits are ubiquitous in cell biology. These structures are often highly dynamic, with subunits in a continuous state of flux, binding to and falling off of filaments. In spite of this constant turnover of their molecular parts, many cellular structures seem to maintain a well-defined size over time, which is often required for their proper functioning. One widely discussed mechanism of size regulation involves the cell maintaining a finite pool of protein subunits available for assembly. This finite pool mechanism can control the length of a single filament by having assembly proceed until the pool of free subunits is depleted to the point when assembly and disassembly are balanced. Still, this leaves open the question whether the same mechanism can provide size control for multiple filamentous structures that are assembled from a common pool of protein subunits, as is often the case in cells. We address this question by solving the steady-state master equation governing the stochastic assembly and disassembly of multi-filament structures made from a shared finite pool of subunits. We find that while the total number of subunits within a multi-filament structure is well defined, individual filaments within the structure have a wide, power-law distribution of lengths. We also compute the phase diagram for two multi-filament structures competing for the same pool of subunits and identify conditions for coexistence when both have a well-defined size. These predictions can be tested in cell experiments in which the size of the subunit pool or the number of filament nucleators is tuned.",

However, whether THVTA activity affects large-scale brain-wide function remains unknown. Here, we selectively activated THVTA neurons in transgenic rats and measured resulting changes in whole-brain activity using stimulus-evoked functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Selective optogenetic stimulation of THVTA neurons not only enhanced cerebral blood volume (CBV) signals in striatal target regions in a dopamine receptor dependent fashion, but also engaged many additional anatomically defined regions throughout the brain. In addition, repeated pairing of THVTA neuronal activity with forepaw stimulation, produced an expanded brain-wide sensory representation. These data suggest that modulation of THVTA neurons can impact brain dynamics across many distributed anatomically distinct regions, even those that receive little to no direct THVTA input.",

    "abstract": "The spatiotemporal localization of the plant hormone auxin acts as a positional cue during early leaf and flower organogenesis. One of the main contributors to auxin localization is the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1). Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that PIN1 genes are split into two sister clades; PIN1 and the relatively uncharacterized Sister-Of-PIN1 (SoPIN1). In this paper we identify entire-2 as a loss-of-function SlSoPIN1a (Solyc10g078370) mutant in Solanum lycopersicum. The entire-2 plants are unable to specify proper leaf initiation leading to a frequent switch from the wild type spiral phyllotactic pattern to distichous and decussate patterns. Leaves in entire-2 are large and less complex and the leaflets display spatial deformities in lamina expansion, vascular development, and margin specification. During sympodial growth in entire-2 the specification of organ position and identity is greatly affected resulting in variable branching patterns on the main sympodial and inflorescence axes. To understand how SlSoPIN1a functions in establishing proper auxin maxima we used the auxin signaling reporter DR5::Venus to visualize differences in auxin localization between entire-2 and wild type. DR5::Venus visualization shows a widening of auxin localization which spreads to subepidermal tissue layers during early leaf and flower organogenesis, showing that SoPIN1 functions to focus auxin signaling to the epidermal layer. The striking spatial deformities observed in entire-2 help provide a mechanistic framework for explaining the function of the SoPIN1 clade in angiosperm species.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe plant hormone auxin acts as a positional signal in most plant developmental processes. The PIN-FORMED family of auxin transporters are the main contributors to auxin localization, especially PIN-FORMED1, which has been studied extensively in plant model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Members of the PIN-FORMED gene family have been found in all plant species, but there is a scarcity of mutants described outside Arabidopsis thaliana. Using Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) as a system, this study identifies a loss of function mutant from the Sister-Of-PIN1 clade in the SlSoPIN1a gene. The characterization of this mutant reveals the role of SlSoPIN1a in establishing position of organ initiation during shoot and reproductive development, including a role in establishing proper spiral phyllotaxy. We use an auxin visualization technique to conclude SlSoPIN1a functions in specifying auxin presence in proper cell layers to establish organ and tissue positioning. This work gives further evolutionary context to how PIN-FORMED genes act to establish organogenesis in the plant kingdom.",

    "abstract": "To examine the role of natural selection on fecundity in a variety of Caenorhabditis elegans genetic backgrounds, we used an experimental evolution protocol to evolve 14 distinct genetic strains over 15-20 generations. Beginning with three founder worms for each strain, we were able to generate 790 distinct genealogies, which provided information on both the effects of natural selection and the evolvability of each strain. Among these genotypes are a wildtype (N2) and a collection of mutants with targeted mutations in the daf-c, daf-d, and AMPK pathways. The overarching goal of our analysis is two-fold: to observe differences in reproductive fitness and observe related changes in reproductive timing. This yields two outcomes. The first is that the majority of selective effects on fecundity occur during the first few generations of evolution, while the negative selection for reproductive timing occurs on longer timescales. The second finding reveals that positive selection on fecundity results in positive and negative selection on reproductive timing, both of which are strain-dependent. Using a derivative of population size per generation called the reproductive carry-over (RCO) measure, it is found that the fluctuation and shape of the probability distribution may be informative in terms of developmental selection. While these consist of general patterns that transcend mutations in a specific gene, changes in the RCO measure may nevertheless be products of selection. In conclusion, we discuss the broader implications of these findings, particularly in the context of genotype-fitness maps and the role of uncharacterized mutations in individual variation and evolvability.",

    "abstract": "Understanding population dynamics from the analysis of molecular and spatial data requires sound statistical modeling. Current approaches assume that populations are naturally partitioned into discrete demes, thereby failing to be relevant in cases where individuals are scattered on a spatial continuum. Other models predict the formation of increasingly tight clusters of individuals in space, which, again, conflicts with biological evidence. Building on recent theoretical work, we introduce a new genealogy-based inference framework that alleviates these issues. This approach effectively implements a stochastic model in which the distribution of individuals is homogeneous and stationary, thereby providing a relevant null model for the fluctuation of genetic diversity in time and space. Importantly, the spatial density of individuals in a population and their range of dispersal during the course of evolution are two parameters that can be inferred separately with this method. The validity of the new inference framework is confirmed with extensive simulations and the analysis of influenza sequences collected over five seasons in the USA.",

    "abstract": "After DNA damage, the cell cycle is arrested to avoid propagation of mutations. In G2 phase, the arrest is initiated by ATM/ATR-dependent signalling that blocks mitosis-promoting kinases as Plk1. Interestingly, Plk1 can counteract ATR-dependent signalling and is required for eventual resumption of the cell cycle. However, what determines when Plk1 activity can resume remains unclear. Here we use FRET-based reporters to show that a global spread of ATM activity on chromatin and phosphorylation of targets including Kap1 control Plk1 re-activation. These phosphorylations are rapidly counteracted by the chromatin-bound phosphatase Wip1, allowing a cell cycle restart despite persistent ATM activity present at DNA lesions. Combining experimental data and mathematical modelling we propose that the minimal duration of a cell cycle arrest is controlled by a timer. Our model shows how cell cycle re-start can occur before completion of DNA repair and suggests a mechanism for checkpoint adaptation in human cells.",

    "abstract": "SummaryThe Mutual Information of pairs of data vectors, for example sequence alignment positions or gene expression profiles, is a quantitative measure of the interdependence between the data. However, data vectors based on a finite number of samples retain non-zero Mutual Information values even for completely random data, which is referred to as background or residual Mutual Information. Estimates of the residual Mutual Information have so far been obtained through heuristic or numerical approximations. Here we introduce a simple analytical formula for the computation of the residual Mutual Information that yields precise values and does not require the joint probabilities between the vector elements as input.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationA C program arMI is available at http://mathbio.crick.ac.uk/wiki/Software#arMI. Using an input alignment in FASTA format or alternatively an internally created random alignment of specified length and depth, the program computes three types of Mutual information: (i) Shannons Mutual Information between all pairs of alignment columns; (ii) the numerical residual Mutual Information by using the same formula on the randomised (shuffled) data; (iii) the analytical residual Mutual Information introduced here. The package depends on the GNU Scientific Library, which is used for vector and matrix operations, factorial expressions and random number generation (Galassi et al., 2009). Reference alignments and result data are included in the program package in the folder  tests. The R environment was used for statistics and plotting (R Core Team, 2014).\\n\\nContactJens.Kleinjung@crick.ac.uk\\n\\nSupplementary MaterialA detailed derivation of the analytical formula is given in the Supplementary Material.",

    "abstract": "Although large-scale efforts for molecular profiling of cancer samples provide multiple data types for many samples, most approaches for finding candidate cancer genes rely on somatic mutations and DNA copy number only. We present a new method, OncoScape, which, for the first time, exploits five complementary data types across 11 cancer types to identify new candidate cancer genes. We find many rarely mutated genes that are strongly affected by other aberrations. We retrieve the majority of known cancer genes but also new candidates such as STK31 and MSRA with very high confidence. Several genes show a dual oncogene-and tumor suppressor-like behavior depending on the tumor type. Most notably, the well-known tumor suppressor RB1 shows strong oncogene-like signal in colon cancer. We applied OncoScape to cell lines representing ten cancer types, providing the most comprehensive comparison of aberrations in cell lines and tumor samples to date. This revealed that glioblastoma, breast and colon cancer show strong similarity between cell lines and tumors, while head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and bladder cancer, exhibit very little similarity between cell lines and tumors. To facilitate exploration of the cancer aberration landscape, we created a web portal enabling interactive analysis of OncoScape results.",

Our method leverages highly incomplete and noisy compound bioactivity signatures from historical high-throughput screening campaigns. We applied our approach in a phenotypic screening workflow and found novel nanomolar inhibitors of cell division that reproduce the mode of action of reference natural products. In a drug discovery setting, our biological hit expansion protocol revealed new inhibitors of the NKCC1 co-transporter for autism spectrum disorders. Furthermore, we demonstrate BIOSEAs capabilities to predict novel targets for old compounds. We report new activities for the drugs nimedipine, fluspirilene and pimozide applicable for compound repurposing and rationalizing drug side effects. Our results highlight the opportunities of reusing public bioactivity data for prospective drug discovery applications where the target or mode of action is not known.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEvidence suggests that Zika virus has driven a 10-fold increase in babies born with microcephaly in Brazil, prompting the WHO to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. However, little is known about the natural history of infection. These data are critical for implementing surveillance and control measures such as protecting the blood supply.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted a systematic review and pooled analysis to estimate the distribution of times from Zika infection to symptom onset, seroconversion, and viral clearance, and analyzed their implications for surveillance and blood supply safety.\\n\\nResultsBased on 25 cases, we estimate the median incubation period of Zika virus infection is 5.9 days (95% CI: 4.4-7.6), and that 95% of those who do develop symptoms will do so by 11.1 days post-infection (95% CI: 7.6-18.0). On average seroconversion occurs 9.0 days (95% CI, 7.0-11.6) after infection, and virus is detectable in blood for 9.9 days (95% CI: 6.8-21.4). In 5% of cases detectable virus persists for over 18.9 days (95% CI: 12.6-79.5). The baseline (no screening) risk of a Zika infected blood donation increases by approximately 1 in 10,000 for every 1 per 100,000 person-days increase in Zika incidence. Symptom based screening reduces this by 7% (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86-0.99), and antibody screening by 29% (RR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.28-0.88).\\n\\nConclusionsSymptom or antibody-based surveillance can do little to reduce the risk of Zika contaminated blood donations. High incidence areas may consider PCR testing to identify lots safe for use in pregnant women.",
