    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae becomes competent for genetic transformation when exposed to an autoinducer peptide named CSP. This peptide was originally described as a quorum-sensing (QS) signal, enabling individual cells to regulate competence in response to population density. However, recent studies suggest that CSP may instead serve as a probe for sensing environmental cues, such as antibiotic stress or environmental diffusion. Here, we show that competence induction can be simultaneously influenced by cell density, external pH, antibiotic-induced stress and cell history. Our experimental data is explained by a mathematical model where the environment and cell history modify how cells produce or sense CSP. Taken together, model and experiments indicate that autoinducer concentration can function as an indicator of cell density across environmental conditions, while also incorporating information on environmental factors or cell history, allowing cells to integrate cues such as antibiotic stress into their QS response. This unifying perspective may apply to other debated QS systems.",

    "abstract": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is considered to be an autoimmune disease mediated by interactions between genes and the environment. To gain a better understanding of the cellular basis for genetic risk, we studied known JIA genetic risk loci, the majority of which are located in non-coding regions, in human neutrophils and CD4 primary T cells to identify genes and functional elements located within those risk loci. We analyzed RNA-Seq data, H3K27ac and H3K4me1 chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data, and previously published chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) data to characterize the chromatin landscapes within the know JIA-associated risk loci. In both neutrophils and primary CD4+ T cells, the majority of the JIA-associated LD blocks contained H3K27ac and/or H3K4me1 marks. These LD blocks were also binding sites for a small group of transcription factors, particularly in neutrophils. Furthermore, these regions showed abundant intronic and intergenic transcription in neutrophils. In neutrophils, none of the genes that were differentially expressed between untreated JIA patients and healthy children was located within the JIA risk LD blocks. In CD4+ T cells, multiple genes, including HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB2, TRAF1, and IRF1 were associated with the long-distance interacting regions within the LD regions as determined from ChIA-PET data. These findings suggest that aberrant transcriptional control is the underlying pathogenic mechanism in JIA. Furthermore, these findings demonstrate the challenges of identifying the actual causal variants within complex genomic/chromatin landscapes.",
