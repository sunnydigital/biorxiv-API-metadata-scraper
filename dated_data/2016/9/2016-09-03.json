    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWUnderstanding key protein-protein interaction network mediated by genes responsive to biotic and abiotic stress could help to understand the functional modules and network topologies driven genes responsive to stresses. It still remains to be an open question whether distinct protein-protein interaction networks have functional or regulatory role in mediating abiotic or biotic stress response in plants. To address this question we compiled abscisic acid responsive genes from Stress-responsive TranscrIption Factor DataBase (version 2; STIFDB2); derived protein-protein interaction network mediated by the genes from STRING database and performed biological network analyses using Cytoscape plugins. We have used Molecular Complex Detection algorithm for deriving highly connected module from the abscisic acid responsive network. Biological Network Gene Ontology tool was used to derive functional enrichment of abscisic acid responsive interaction network using GOSlim_Plants ontology. GraphletCounter was used to identify graph motifs in the network and NetworkAnalyzer was used to compute various network topological parameters. We found 26S proteasome subunits as a highly clustered module using Molecular Complex Detection algorithm. Enrichment analysis indicates that several biological processes terms including \\\"flower development\\\" are associated with the network. Results from this case study can be used to understand network properties of abiotic stress responsive genes and gene products in a model plant system.",

    "abstract": "MotivationProtein contacts contain key information for the understanding of protein structure and function and thus, contact prediction from sequence is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not extremely useful for de novo structure prediction.\\n\\nMethodThis paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual neural networks. The first residual network conducts a series of 1-dimensional convolutional transformation of sequential features; the second residual network conducts a series of 2-dimensional convolutional transformation of pairwise information including output of the first residual network, EC information and pairwise potential. By using very deep residual networks, we can model contact occurring patterns and very complex sequence-structure relationship and thus, obtain high-quality contact prediction regardless of how many sequence homologs are available for proteins in question.\\n\\nResultsOur method greatly outperforms existing methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted folding. Tested on 105 CASP11 targets, 76 past CAMEO hard targets, and 398 membrane proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained our method, one representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints but without any force fields can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore>0.6) for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models especially for membrane proteins. The 3D models built from our contact prediction have TMscore>0.5 for 208 of the 398 membrane proteins, while those from homology modeling have TMscore>0.5 for only 10 of them. Further, even if trained by only non-membrane proteins, our deep learning method works very well on membrane protein contact prediction. In the recent blind CAMEO benchmark, our fully-automated web server implementing this method successfully folded 4 targets with a new fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs, including one {beta} protein of 182 residues, one +{beta} protein of 125 residues, one  protein of 140 residues and one  protein of 217 residues.\\n\\nAvailability: http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/ContactMap/\\n\\nAuthor SummaryProtein contact prediction from sequence alone is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem due to the development of direct evolutionary coupling analysis (DCA). However, DCA is effective on only some proteins with a very large number (>1000) of sequence homologs. To further improve contact prediction, we borrow ideas from the latest breakthrough of deep learning, a powerful machine learning technique that has recently revolutionized object recognition, speech recognition and the GO game. We have developed a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both sequence conservation and co-variation information through an ultra-deep neural network, which can model very complex relationship between sequence and contact map as well as high-order correlation among residues.\\n\\nOur test results suggest that deep learning can revolutionize protein contact prediction. Tested on 398 membrane proteins, the L/10 long-range accuracy obtained by our method is 77.6% while that by the state-of-the-art methods CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 51.8% and 61.2%, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints can generate much better 3D structural models than the other contact prediction methods. In particular, without using any force fields our predicted contacts yield correct folds for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models (TBM) built from the training proteins. For example, our contact-assisted models have TMscore>0.5 for 208 of the 398 membrane proteins while TBMs have TMscore >0.5 for only 10 of them. Even without using any membrane proteins to train our deep learning models, our method still performs very well on membrane protein contact prediction. Recent blind test of our method in CAMEO shows that our method successfully folded 4 targets with a new fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs.",

    "abstract": "Patient stratification or disease subtyping is crucial for precision medicine and personalized treatment of complex diseases. The increasing availability of high-throughput molecular data provides a great opportunity for patient stratification. In particular, many clustering methods have been employed to tackle this problem in a purely data-driven manner. Yet, existing methods leveraging high-throughput molecular data often suffers from various limitations, e.g., noise, data heterogeneity, high dimensionality or poor interpretability. Here we introduced an Entropy-based Consensus Clustering (ECC) method that overcomes those limitations all together. Our ECC method employs an entropy-based utility function to fuse many basic partitions to a consensus one that agrees with the basic ones as much as possible. Maximizing the utility function in ECC has a much more meaningful interpretation than any other consensus clustering methods. Moreover, we exactly map the complex utility maximization problem to the classic K-means clustering problem with a modified distance function, which can then be efficiently solved with linear time and space complexity. Our ECC method can also naturally integrate multiple molecular data types measured from the same set of subjects, and easily handle missing values without any imputation. We applied ECC to both synthetic and real data, including 35 cancer gene expression benchmark datasets and 13 cancer types with four molecular data types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We found that ECC shows superior performance against existing clustering methods. Our results clearly demonstrate the power of ECC in clinically relevant patient stratification.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe N-end rule pathway has emerged as a major system for regulating protein functions by controlling their turn-over in medical, animal and plant sciences as well as agriculture. Although novel functions and enzymes of the pathway were discovered, ubiquitination mechanism and substrate specificity of N-end rule pathway E3 Ubiquitin ligases remained elusive. Taking the first discovered bona fide plant N-end rule E3 ligase PROTEOLYSIS1 (PRT1) as a model, we use a novel tool to molecularly characterize polyubiquitination live, in real-time.\\nC_LIO_LIWe gained mechanistic insights in PRT1 substrate preference and activation by monitoring live ubiquitination by using a fluorescent chemical probe coupled to artificial substrate reporters. Ubiquitination was measured by rapid in-gel fluorescence scanning as well as in real time by fluorescence polarization.\\nC_LIO_LIEnzymatic activity, substrate specificity, mechanisms and reaction optimization of PRT1-mediated ubiquitination were investigated ad hoc in short time and with significantly reduced reagent consumption.\\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrated for the first time that PRT1 is indeed an E3 ligase, which was hypothesized for over two decades.
