    "abstract": "The coalescent process is an important and widely used model for inferring the dynamics of biological populations from samples of genetic diversity. Coalescent analysis typically involves applying statistical methods to either samples of genetic sequences or an estimated genealogy in order to estimate the demographic history of the population from which the samples originated. Several parametric and non-parametric estimation techniques, employing diverse methods, such as Gaussian processes and Monte Carlo particle filtering, already exist. However, these techniques often trade estimation accuracy and sophistication for methodological flexibility and ease of use. Thus, there is room for new coalescent estimation techniques that can be easily implemented for a range of inference problems while still maintaining some sense of statistical optimality.\\n\\nHere we introduce the Bayesian Snyder filter as a natural, easily implementable and flexible minimum mean square error estimator for parametric demographic functions. By reinterpreting the coalescent as a self-correcting inhomogeneous Poisson process, we show that the Snyder filter can be applied to both isochronous (sampled at one time point) and heterochronous (serially sampled) estimation problems. We test the estimation performance of the filter on both standard, simulated demographic models and on a well-studied empirical dataset comprising hepatitis= C virus sequences from Egypt. Additionally, we provide some analytical insight into the relationship between the Snyder filter and popular maximum likelihood and skyline plot techniques for coalescent inference. The Snyder filter is an exact and direct Bayesian estimation method that provides optimal mean square error estimates. It has the potential to become as a useful, alternative technique for coalescent inference.",

    "abstract": "The success of fMRI places constraints on the nature of the neural code. The fact that researchers can infer similarities between neural representations, despite limitations in what fMRI measures, implies that certain neural coding schemes are more likely than others. For fMRI to be successful given its low temporal and spatial resolution, the neural code must be smooth at the sub-voxel and functional level such that similar stimuli engender similar internal representations. Through proof and simulation, we evaluate a number of reasonable coding schemes and demonstrate that only a subset are plausible given both fMRIs successes and its limitations in measuring neural activity. Deep neural network approaches, which have been forwarded as computational accounts of the ventral stream, are consistent with the success of fMRI, though functional smoothness breaks down in the later network layers. These results have implications for the nature of neural code and ventral stream, as well as what can be successfully investigated with fMRI.",

For the first time, genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 x 10-8) were identified for many common infections. The associations were mapped to genes with key roles in acquired and innate immunity (HLA, IFNA21, FUT2, ST3GAL4, ABO, IFNL4, LCE3E, DSG1, LTBR, MTMR3, TNFRSF13B, TNFSF13B, NFKB1, CD40) and in regulation of embryonic developmental process (TBX1, FGF, FOXA1 and FOXN1). Several missense mutations were also identified (in LCE5A, DSG1, FUT2, TBX1, CDHR3, PLG, TNFRSF13B, FOXA1, SH2B3, ST5 and FOXN1). Missense mutations in FUT2 and TBX1 were implicated in multiple infections. We applied fine-mapping analysis to dissect associations in the human leukocyte antigen region, which suggested important roles of specific amino acid polymorphisms in the antigen-binding clefts. Our findings provide an important step toward dissecting the host genetic architecture of response to common infections.",

    "abstract": "Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in Mendelian disease diagnosis. Despite their success, the current diagnostic rate for genomic analyses across a variety of rare diseases is approximately 25-50%. Here, we explore the utility of transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) as a complementary diagnostic tool in a cohort of 50 patients with genetically undiagnosed rare muscle disorders. We describe an integrated approach to analyze patient muscle RNA-seq, leveraging an analysis framework focused on the detection of transcript-level changes that are unique to the patient compared to over 180 control skeletal muscle samples. We demonstrate the power of RNA-seq to validate candidate splice-disrupting mutations and to identify splice-altering variants in both exonic and deep intronic regions, yielding an overall diagnosis rate of 35%. We also report the discovery of a highly recurrent de novo intronic mutation in COL6A1 that results in a dominantly acting splice-gain event, disrupting the critical glycine repeat motif of the triple helical domain. We identify this pathogenic variant in a total of 27 genetically unsolved patients in an external collagen VI-like dystrophy cohort, thus explaining approximately 25% of patients clinically suggestive of collagen VI dystrophy in whom prior genetic analysis is negative. Overall, this study represents a large systematic application of transcriptome sequencing to rare disease diagnosis and highlights its utility for the detection and interpretation of variants missed by current standard diagnostic approaches.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryTranscriptome sequencing improves the diagnostic rate for Mendelian disease in patients for whom genetic analysis has not returned a diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "The coordinated behaviour of populations of cells plays a central role in tissue growth and renewal. Cells react to their microenvironment by modulating processes such as movement, growth and proliferation, and signalling. Alongside experimental studies, computational models offer a useful means by which to investigate these processes. To this end a variety of cell-based modelling approaches have been developed, ranging from lattice-based cellular automata to lattice-free models that treat cells as point-like particles or extended shapes. It is difficult to accurately compare between different modelling approaches, since one cannot distinguish between differences in behaviour due to the underlying model assumptions and those due to differences in the numerical implementation of the model. Here, we exploit the availability of an implementation of five popular cell-based modelling approaches within a consistent computational framework, Chaste (http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste). This framework allows one to easily change constitutive assumptions within these models. In each case we provide full details of all technical aspects of our model implementations. We compare model implementations using four case studies, chosen to reflect the key cellular processes of proliferation, adhesion, and short-and long-range signalling. These case studies demonstrate the applicability of each model and provide a guide for model usage.\\n\\nAuthors contributionsJO and AF conceived of the study, designed the study, coordinated the study, carried out the computational modelling and drafted the manuscript.

    "abstract": "Rule-based modeling frameworks provide a specification format in which kinetic interactions are modeled as \\\"reaction rules\\\". These rules are specified on phosphorylation motifs, domains, binding sites and other sub-molecular structures, and have proved useful for modeling signal transduction. Visual representations are necessary to understand individual rules as well as analyze interactions of hundreds of rules, which motivates the need for automated diagramming tools for rule-based models. Here, we present a theoretical framework that unifies the layers of information in a rule-based model and enables automated visualization of (i) the mechanism encoded in a rule, (ii) the regulatory interaction of two or more rules, and (iii) the emergent network architecture of a large rule set. Specifically, we present a compact rule visualization that conveys the action of a rule explicitly (unlike conventional visualizations), a regulatory graph visualization that conveys regulatory interactions between rules, and a set of graph compression methods that synthesize informative pathway diagrams from complex regulatory graphs. These methods enable inference of network motifs (such as feedback and feed-forward loops), automated generation of signal flow diagrams for hundreds of rules, and tunable network compression using heuristics and graph analysis, all of which are advances over the state of the art for rule-based models. These methods also produce more readable diagrams than currently available tools as we show with an empirical comparison across 27 published rule-based models of various sizes. We provide an implementation in the open source and freely available BioNetGen framework, but the underlying methods are applicable to all current rule-based models in BioNetGen, Kappa and Simmune frameworks. We expect that these tools will promote communication and analysis of rule-based models and their eventual integration into whole cell models.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySignaling in living cells is mediated through a complex network of chemical interactions. Current predictive models of signal pathways have hundreds of reaction rules that specify chemical interactions, and a comprehensive model of a stem cell or cancer cell would be expected to have many more. Visualizations of rules and their interactions are needed to navigate, organize, communicate and analyze large signaling models. In this work, we have developed: (i) a novel visualization for individual rules that compactly conveys what each rule does, (ii) a comprehensive visualization of a set of rules as a network of regulatory interactions called a regulatory graph, and (iii) a set of procedures for compressing the regulatory graph into a pathway diagram that highlights underlying signaling motifs such as feedback and feedforward loops. We show that these visualizations are compact and informative across models of widely varying sizes. The methods developed here not only improve the understandability of current models, but also establish principles for organizing the much larger models of the future.",

But how different are these areas when compared in the same task? We recorded neuronal responses in both regions in macaques in a task with cognitive and limbic aspects, a token gambling task. Using tokens allowed us to compare responses to wins and losses. Both regions phasically encoded several important economic variables in similar ways; these included offered values, remembered values, attended values, and obtained values, and number of current tokens. Signal-to-noise ratio in sgACC was substantially lower than in dACC, and sgACC neurons responded more strongly to losses and in anticipation of large rewards. These results highlight the common economic functions of the anterior cingulum and suggest different functional emphases between regions, rather than a strict cognitive vs. emotional division.",

    "abstract": "Rare genetic variants are abundant in humans yet their functional effects are often unknown and challenging to predict. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project provides a unique opportunity to identify the functional impact of rare variants through combined analyses of whole genomes and multi-tissue RNA-sequencing data. Here, we identify gene expression outliers, or individuals with extreme expression levels, across 44 human tissues, and characterize the contribution of rare variation to these large changes in expression. We find 58% of underexpression and 28% of overexpression outliers have underlying rare variants compared with 9% of non-outliers. Large expression effects are enriched for proximal loss-of-function, splicing, and structural variants, particularly variants near the TSS and at evolutionarily conserved sites. Known disease genes have expression outliers, underscoring that rare variants can contribute to genetic disease risk. To prioritize functional rare regulatory variants, we develop RIVER, a Bayesian approach that integrates RNA and whole genome sequencing data from the same individual. RIVER predicts functional variants significantly better than models using genomic annotations alone, and is an extensible tool for personal genome interpretation. Overall, we demonstrate that rare variants contribute to large gene expression changes across tissues with potential health consequences, and provide an integrative method for interpreting rare variants in individual genomes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetics of gene regulation provides information on the cellular mechanisms through which genetic variation influences complex traits. Expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs, are enriched for polymorphisms that have been found to be associated with disease risk. While most analyses of human data has focused on regulation of expression by nearby variants (cis-eQTLs), distal or trans-eQTLs may have broader effects on the transcriptome and important phenotypic consequences, necessitating a comprehensive study of the effects of genetic variants on distal gene transcription levels. In this work, we identify trans-eQTLs in the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project data1, consisting of 449 individuals with RNA-sequencing data across 44 tissue types. We find 81 genes with a trans-eQTL in at least one tissue, and we demonstrate that trans-eQTLs are more likely than cis-eQTLs to have effects specific to a single tissue. We evaluate the genomic and functional properties of trans-eQTL variants, identifying strong enrichment in enhancer elements and Piwi-interacting RNA clusters. Finally, we describe three tissue-specific regulatory loci underlying relevant disease associations: 9q22 in thyroid that has a role in thyroid cancer, 5q31 in skeletal muscle, and a previously reported master regulator near KLF14 in adipose. These analyses provide a comprehensive characterization of trans-eQTLs across human tissues, which contribute to an improved understanding of the tissue-specific cellular mechanisms of regulatory genetic variation.",

    "abstract": "The complex genetic programs of eukaryotic cells are often regulated by key transcription factors occupying or clearing out of a large number of genomic locations. Orchestrating the residence times of these factors is therefore important for the well organized functioning of a large network. The classic models of genetic switches sidestep this timing issue by assuming the binding of transcription factors to be governed entirely by thermodynamic protein-DNA affinities. Here we show that relying on passive thermodynamics and random release times can lead to a \\\"time-scale crisis\\\" of master genes that broadcast their signals to large number of binding sites. We demonstrate that this \\\"time-scale crisis\\\" can be resolved by actively regulating residence times through molecular stripping. We illustrate these ideas by studying the stochastic dynamics of the genetic network of the central eukaryotic master regulator NF{kappa}B which broadcasts its signals to many downstream genes that regulate immune response, apoptosis etc.",

    "abstract": "The potential for genetic discovery in human DNA sequencing studies is greatly diminished if DNA samples from the cohort are mislabelled, swapped, contaminated, or include unintended individuals. Unfortunately, the potential for such errors is significant since DNA samples are often manipulated by several protocols, labs or scientists in the process of sequencing. We have developed peddy to identify and facilitate the remediation of such errors via interactive visualizations and reports comparing the stated sex, relatedness, and ancestry to what is inferred from each individuals genotypes. Peddy predicts a samples ancestry using a machine learning model trained on individuals of diverse ancestries from the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel. Peddys speed, text reports and web interface facilitate both automated and visual detection of sample swaps, poor sequencing quality and other indicators of sample problems that, were they left undetected, would inhibit discovery.\\n\\nSoftware Availabilityhttps://github.com/brentp/peddy\\n\\nDemonstration (Chrome suggested)http://home.chpc.utah.edu/[~]u6000771//plots/ceph1463.html",

    "abstract": "Quorum sensing (QS) explains a type of bacterial cell-cell communication mediated by exocellular compounds that act as autoinducers (AIs). As such, QS can be considered the most primordial form of language. QS has profound implications for the control of many important traits (e.g. biofilm formation, secretion of virulence factors, etc.). Conceptually, the QS response can be split into its \\\"listening\\\" and \\\"speaking\\\" components, i.e. the power to sense AI levels vs. the ability to synthesize and release these molecules. By explaining the cell-density dependence of QS behavior as the consequence of the systems arrival to a threshold AI concentration, models of QS have traditionally assumed a salient role for the \\\"QS speaking\\\" module during bacterial cell-to-cell communication. In this paper, we have provided evidence that challenges this AI-centered view of QS and establishes LuxR-like activators at the center of QS. Our observation that highly coordinated, cell-density dependent responses can occur in the absence of AI production, implies that the ability to launch such responses is engrained within the \\\"QS listening\\\" module. Our data indicates that once a critical threshold of intracellular activator monomers in complex with AI is reached, a highly orchestrated QS response ensues. While displaying a clear cell-density dependence, such response does not strictly require the sensing of population levels by individual cells. We additionally show, both in vivo and in silico, that despite their synchronous nature, QS responses do not require that all the cells in the population participate in the response. Central to our analysis was the discovery that percolation theory (PT) can be used to mathematically describe QS responses. While groundbreaking, our results are in agreement with and integrate the latest conclusions reached in the field. We explain for the first time, the cell-density-dependent synchronicity of QS responses as the function of a single protein, the LuxR-like activator, capable of coordinating the temporal response of a population of cells in the absence of cell-to-cell communication. Being QS the most primordial form of speech, our results have important implications for the evolution of language in its ancient chemical form.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of males and outcrossing is widespread, despite considerable costs of males. By enabling recombination between distinct genotypes, outcrossing may be advantageous during adaptation to a novel environments and if so, it should be selected for under environmental challenge. However, a given environmental change may influence fitness of male, female, and hermaphrodite or asexual individuals differently, and hence the relationship between reproductive system and dynamics of adaptation to novel conditions may not be driven solely by the level of outcrossing and recombination. This has important implications for studies investigating the evolution of reproductive modes in the context of environmental changes, and for the extent to which their findings can be generalized. Here, we use Caenorhabditis elegans - a free-living nematode species in which hermaphrodites (capable of selfing but not cross-fertilizing each other) coexist with males (capable of fertilizing hermaphrodites) - to investigate the response of wild type as well as obligatorily outcrossing and obligatorily selfing lines to stressfully increased ambient temperature. We found that thermal stress affects fitness of outcrossers much more drastically than that of selfers. This shows that apart from the potential for recombination, the selective pressures imposed by the same environmental change can differ between populations expressing different reproductive systems and affect their adaptive potential.",

    "abstract": "SNP heritability, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by SNPs, has been reported for many hundreds of traits. Its estimation requires strong prior assumptions about the distribution of heritability across the genome, but the assumptions in current use have not been thoroughly tested. By analyzing imputed data for a large number of human traits, we empirically derive a model that more accurately describes how heritability varies with minor allele frequency, linkage disequilibrium and genotype certainty. Across 19 traits, our improved model leads to estimates of common SNP heritability on average 43% (SD 3) higher than those obtained from the widely-used software GCTA, and 25% (SD 2) higher than those from the recently-proposed extension GCTA-LDMS. Previously, DNaseI hypersensitivity sites were reported to explain 79% of SNP heritability; using our improved heritability model their estimated contribution is only 24%.",

We demonstrate here that statistical adjustment employing existing quality measures largely fails to remove the effects of RNA degradation when RNA quality associates with the outcome of interest. Using RNA-seq data from a molecular degradation experiment of human brain tissue, we introduce the quality surrogate variable (qSVA) analysis framework for estimating and removing the confounding effect of RNA quality in differential expression analysis. We show this approach results in greatly improved replication rates (>3x) across two large independent postmortem human brain studies of schizophrenia. Finally, we explored public datasets to demonstrate potential RNA quality confounding when comparing expression levels of different brain regions and diagnostic groups beyond schizophrenia. Our approach can therefore improve the interpretation of differential expression analysis of transcriptomic data from the human brain.",

Social defeat caused a weakening of functional connectivity between these two areas and selective inhibition of these projections mimicked the behavioral effects of social defeat. These findings define a specific neural projection by which the prefrontal cortex can control and adapt social behavior.",

For instance, the gender ratio in biology is more balanced than in computer science. We were interested in how this difference is reflected in the interdisciplinary field of computational/quantitative biology. To this end, we examined the proportion of female authors in publications from the PubMed and arXiv databases. There are fewer female authors on research papers in computational biology, as compared to biology in general. This is true across authorship position, year, and journal impact factor. A comparison with arXiv shows that quantitative biology papers have a higher ratio of female authors than computer science papers, placing computational biology in between its two parent fields in terms of gender representation. Both in biology and in computational biology, a female last author increases the probability of other authors on the paper being female, pointing to a potential role of female PIs in influencing the gender balance.",
