    "abstract": "Biological introductions bring into contact species that can still hybridize. The evolutionary outcomes of such secondary contacts may be diverse (e.g. adaptive introgression from or into the introduced species) but are not yet well examined in the wild. The recent secondary contact between the non-native sea squirt Ciona robusta (formerly known as C. intestinalis type A) and its native congener C. intestinalis (formerly known as C. intestinalis type B), in the western English Channel, provides an excellent case study to examine. To examine contemporary hybridization between the two species, we developed a panel of 310 ancestry-informative SNPs from a population transcriptomic study. Hybridization rates were examined on 449 individuals sampled in 8 sites from the sympatric range and 5 sites from allopatric ranges. The results clearly showed an almost complete absence of contemporary hybridization between the two species in syntopic localities, with only one first generation hybrid and no other genotype compatible with recent backcrosses. Despite the almost lack of contemporary hybridization, shared polymorphisms were observed in sympatric and allopatric populations of both species. Furthermore, one allopatric population from SE Pacific exhibited a higher rate of shared polymorphisms compared to all other C. robusta populations. Altogether, these results indicate that the observed level of shared polymorphism is more probably the outcome of ancient gene flow spread afterwards at a worldwide scale. They also emphasise efficient reproductive barriers preventing hybridization between introduced and native species, which suggests hybridization should not impede too much the expansion and the establishment of the non-native species in its introduction range.",

Our methodology based on a kinematic analysis of cell lineage data reveals deformation patterns and quantitative morphogenetic landmarks for a new type of developmental table. The characteristic spatial and temporal length scales of mechanical deformation patterns derived from a continuous approximation of cell displacements indicate a compressible fluid-like behavior of zebrafish gastrulating tissues. The instantaneous deformation rate at the mesoscopic level of the cells neighborhood is spatially and temporally heterogeneous. The robustness of mechanical patterns results from their cumulative history along cell trajectories. Unsupervised classification of mechanical descriptor profiles was used to assess the homogeneity of biomechanical cues in cell populations. Further clustering of cell trajectories according to their cumulative mesoscopic biomechanical history during gastrulation revealed ordered and coherent spatiotemporal patterns comparable to that of the embryonic fate map.",

    "abstract": "Communication between neighboring tissues plays a central role in guiding organ morphogenesis. During heart tube assembly, interactions with the adjacent endoderm control the medial movement of cardiomyocytes, a process referred to as cardiac fusion. However, the molecular underpinnings of this endodermal-myocardial relationship remain unclear. Here, we show an essential role for platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra) in directing cardiac fusion. In both zebrafish and mouse, mutation of pdgfra inhibits cardiac fusion and can lead to cardia bifida. Timelapse analysis of individual cardiomyocyte trajectories reveals misdirected cells in zebrafish pdgfra mutants, suggesting that PDGF signaling steers cardiomyocytes toward the midline. Intriguingly, the ligand pdgfaa is expressed in the endoderm medial to the pdgfra-expressing myocardial precursors. Ectopic expression of pdgfaa interferes with cardiac fusion, consistent with an instructive role for PDGF signaling. Together, these data uncover a novel mechanism through which endodermal-myocardial communication guides the cell movements that initiate cardiac morphogenesis.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTStudies in zebrafish and mouse implicate the PDGF signaling pathway in the communication between the endoderm and the myocardium that drives medial myocardial movement and thereby initiates cardiac morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Niemann Pick C disease (NPC) is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to excessive storage of cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomes and lysosomes. The large majority of NPC disease is caused by mutations in NPC1, a large polytopic membrane protein that functions in late endosomes. There are many disease-associated mutations in NPC1, and most patients are compound heterozygotes. The most common mutation NPC1I1061T has been shown to cause endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation of the NPC1 protein. Treatment of patient derived NPC1I1061T fibroblasts with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) Vorinostat or Panobinostat increases expression of the mutant NPC1 protein and leads to correction of the cholesterol storage. Herein we show that several other human NPC1 mutant fibroblast cell lines can also be corrected by Vorinostat or Panobinostat and that treatment with Vorinostat extends the lifetime of the NPC1I1061T protein. To test effects of HDACi on a large number of NPC1 mutants, we engineered a U2OS cell line to suppress NPC1 expression by shRNA and then transiently transfected these cells with 81 different NPC1 mutant constructs. The mutant NPC1 did not significantly reduce cholesterol accumulation, but approximately 80% of the mutants showed reduced cholesterol accumulation when treated with Vorinostat or Panobinostat.",

In several experiments we show that language, in the form of verbal cues, both aids recognition of ambiguous \\\"Mooney\\\" images and improves objective visual discrimination performance in a match/non-match task. We then used electroencephalography (EEG) to better understand the mechanisms of this effect. The improved discrimination of images previously labeled was accompanied by a larger occipital-parietal P1 evoked response to the meaningful versus meaningless target stimuli. Time-frequency analysis of the interval between the cue and the target stimulus revealed increases in the power of posterior alpha-band (8-14 Hz) oscillations when the meaning of the stimuli to be compared was trained. The magnitude of the pre-target alpha difference and the P1 amplitude difference were positively correlated across individuals. These results suggest that prior knowledge prepares the brain for upcoming perception via the modulation of alpha-band oscillations, and that this preparatory state influences early (~120 ms) stages of visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Codon usage in 2730 genomes is analyzed for evolutionary patterns in the usage of synonymous codons and amino acids across prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa. We group genomes together that have similar amounts of intra-genomic bias in their codon usage, and then compare how usage of particular different codons is diversified across each genome group, and how that usage varies from group to group. Inter-genomic diversity of codon usage increases with intra-genomic usage bias, following a universal pattern. The frequencies of the different codons vary in robust mutual correlation, and the implied synonymous codon and amino acid usages drift together. This kind of correlation indicates that the variation of codon usage across organisms is chiefly a consequence of lateral DNA transfer among diverse organisms. The group of genomes with the greatest intra-genomic bias comprises two distinct subgroups, with each one restricting its codon usage to essentially one unique half of the genetic code table. These organisms include eubacteria and archaea thought to be closest to the hypothesized last universal common ancestor (LUCA). Their codon usages imply genetic diversity near the hypothesized base of the tree of life. There is a continuous evolutionary progression across taxa from the two extremely diversified usages toward balanced usage of different codons (as approached, e.g. in mammals). In that progression, codon frequency variations are correlated as expected from a blending of the two extreme codon usages seen in prokaryotes.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe redundancy intrinsic to the genetic code allows different amino acids to be encoded by up to six synonymous codons. Genomes of different organisms prefer different synonymous codons, a phenomenon known as  codon usage bias. The phenomenon of codon usage bias is of fundamental interest for evolutionary biology, and is important in a variety of applied settings (e.g., transgene expression). The spectrum of codon usage biases seen in current organisms is commonly thought to have arisen by the combined actions of mutations and selective pressures. This view focuses on codon usage in specific genomes and the consequences of that usage for protein expression.\\n\\nHere we investigate an unresolved question of molecular genetics: are there global rules governing the usage of synonymous codons made by genomic DNA across organisms? To answer this question, we employed a data-driven approach to surveying 2730 species from all kingdoms of the  tree of life in order to classify their codon usage. A first major result was that the large majority of these organisms use codons rather uniformly on the genome-wide scale, without giving preference to particular codons among possible synonymous alternatives. A second major result was that two compartments of codon usage seem to co-exist and to be expressed in different proportions by different organisms. As such, we investigate how individual different codons are used in different organisms from all taxa. Whereas codon usage is generally believed to be the evolutionary result of both mutations and natural selection, our results suggest a different perspective: the usage of different codons (and amino acids) by different organisms follows a superposition of two distinct patterns of usage. One distinction locates to the third base pair of all different codons, which in one pattern is U or A, and in the other pattern is G or C. This result has two major implications: (1) the variation of codon usage as seen across different organisms is best accounted for by lateral gene transfer among diverse organisms; (2) the organisms that are by protein homology grouped near the base of the  tree of life comprise two genetically distinct lineages.\\n\\nWe find that, over evolutionary time, codon usages have converged from two distinct, non-overlapping usages (e.g., as evident in bacteria and archaea) to a near-uniform, balanced usage of synonymous codons (e.g., in mammals). This shows that the variations of codon (and amino acid) biases reveal a distinct evolutionary progression. We also find that codon usage in bacteria and archaea is most diverse between organisms thought to be closest to the hypothesized last universal common ancestor (LUCA). The dichotomy in codon (and amino acid usages) present near the origin of the current  tree of life might provide information about the evolutionary development of the genetic code.",

The reviewed theoretical approaches offer a framework for extracting features, biophysical parameters, predictions, and so on, based on a large variety of experimental data, such as chromosomal capture data, single particle trajectories, and more.

However, their functional impact and relevance to tumorigenesis remains mostly unknown. We carried out a systematic analysis to characterize the potential functional consequences of alternative splicing changes in thousands of tumor samples. This analysis revealed that a subset of alternative splicing changes affect protein domain families that are frequently mutated in tumors and potentially disrupt protein protein interactions in cancer-related pathways. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between the number of these alternative splicing changes in a sample and the number of somatic mutations in drivers. We propose that a subset of the alternative splicing changes observed in tumors may represent independent oncogenic processes that could be relevant to explain the functional transformations in cancer and some of them could potentially be considered alternative splicing drivers (AS-drivers).",

    "abstract": "Brain Computer Interface (BCI), a direct pathway between the human brain and computer, is one of the most pragmatic applications of EEG signal. The electroencephalograph (EEG) signal is one of the monitoring techniques to observe brain functionality. Mental Task Classification (MTC) based on EEG signals is a demanding BCI. Success of BCI system depends on the efficient analysis of these signals. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is a filter based heuristic technique which is utilized to analyze EEG signal in recent past. There are several variants of EMD algorithms which have their own merits and demerits. In this paper, we have explored three variants of EMD algorithms named Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) on EEG data for MTC-based BCI. Features are extracted from EEG signal in two phases; in the first phase, the signal is decomposed into different oscillatory functions with the help of different EMD algorithms and eight different parameters (features) are calculated for each function for compact representation in the second phase. These features are fed into Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify the different mental tasks. We have formulated two different types of MTC, the first one is binary and second one is multi-MTC. The proposed work outperforms the existing work for both binary and multi mental tasks classification.",

As cells progress to mitosis, centrosomes recruit more microtubules (MT) to form mitotic bipolar spindles that ensure proper chromosome segregation. We report a new role for ATX-2, a C. elegans ortholog of Human Ataxin-2, in regulating centrosome size and MT dynamics. ATX-2, an RNA-binding protein, forms a complex with SZY-20 in an RNA-independent fashion. Depleting ATX-2 results in embryonic lethality and cytokinesis failure, and restores centrosome duplication to zyg-1 mutants. In this pathway, SZY-20 promotes ATX-2 abundance, which inversely correlates with centrosome size. Centrosomes depleted of ATX-2 exhibit elevated levels of centrosome factors (ZYG-1, SPD-5, {gamma}-Tubulin), increasing MT nucleating activity but impeding MT growth. We show that ATX-2 influences MT behavior through {gamma}-Tubulin at the centrosome. Our data suggest that RNA-binding proteins play an active role in controlling MT dynamics and provide insight into the control of proper centrosome size and MT dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Helminth parasites represent a significant threat to wild, domesticated, and research animal health. Pseudocapillaria tomentosa is a common intestinal nematode parasite and an important source of infection in zebrafish. Symptoms of the infection vary widely from no clinical signs to sever emaciation and mortality, however, the reasons underpinning these disparate outcomes are unclear. Components of the microbiome may interact with parasites to influence their success in the gut while parasite infections are also known to influence the composition of the gut microbiome. In this study we evaluated the longitudinal changes in the gut microbiome structure and gut physiology during experimental P. tomentosa infection in adult 5D line zebrafish. We observed less severe signs of infection and less mortality in these fish than previously described in AB line fish. However, inflammation and epithelial hyperplasia in the intestine was still observed in infected 5D line fish. The composition of the microbiome changed rapidly during the infection and these changes were associated with parasite stage of development and burden. Individual taxa covaried with parasite abundance in the intestine intimating the gut microbiome may influence parasite burden. Associations between taxa and parasite abundance in some cases appeared to be phylogenetically patterned. Strong positive associations were observed between OTUs phylotyped to Proteobacteria and abundance of adult parasites and parasite eggs. Together these experiments demonstrate that P. tomentosa infection results in a rapid and temporally dynamic disruption of the zebrafish gut microbiome and clarify how interactions between the gut microbiome and intestinal parasites may impact fish populations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryTo establish the animal body plan, embryos link the external epidermis to the internal digestive tract. In Caenorhabditis elegans, this linkage is achieved by the Arcade Cells, which form an epithelial bridge between the foregut and epidermis, but little is known about how development of these three epithelia is coordinated temporally. The Arcade Cell epithelium is generated after the epidermis and digestive tract epithelia have matured, ensuring that both organs can withstand the mechanical stress of embryo elongation; mis-timing of epithelium formation leads to defects in morphogenesis. Here, we report that temporal regulation of the Arcade Cell epithelium is mediated by the pioneer transcription factor PHA-4/FoxA, the cytoskeletal regulator ZEN-4/MKLP and the polarity protein PAR-6. We find that PHA-4 activates expression of a broad cohort of epithelial genes. However, accumulation of protein is delayed by ZEN-4, acting in concert with its partner CYK-4/MgcRacGAP. Finally, PAR-6 localizes factors within adherens junctions and at the apical surface, leading to Arcade Cell polarity. The results reveal that the timing of a landmark event during embryonic morphogenesis is mediated by the concerted action of four proteins that delay the formation of an epithelial bridge. In addition, we find that FoxA associates with many epithelial genes in mammals, suggesting that regulation of epithelial identity may be a conserved feature of FoxA factors and a contributor to FoxA function in development and cancer.",

While various models have highlighted working memory, reinforcement learning, and cognitive control as key functions, a single framework for interpreting the range of effects observed in prefrontal cortex has yet to emerge. Here we show that a simple computational motif based on predictive coding can be stacked hierarchically to learn and perform arbitrarily complex goal-directed behavior. The resulting Hierarchical Error Representation (HER) model simulates a wide array of findings from fMRI, ERP, single-units, and neuropsychological studies of both lateral and medial prefrontal cortex. Additionally, the model compares favorably with current machine learning approaches, learning more rapidly and with comparable performance, while self-organizing representations into efficient hierarchical groups and managing working memory storage. By reconceptualizing lateral prefrontal activity as anticipating prediction errors, the HER model provides a novel unifying account of prefrontal cortex function with broad implications both for understanding the frontal cortex and building more powerful machine learning applications.",

Until recently, they have, however, often ignored the potential consequences of intraspecific trait variation (ITV). This position becomes potentially more problematic when studying animals and behavioural traits, as behaviours can be altered very flexibly at the individual level to track environmental changes.\\nC_LIO_LIUrban areas are an extreme example of human-changed environments, exposing organisms to multiple, strong, yet relatively standardized, selection pressures. Adaptive behavioural responses are thought to play a major role in animals success or failure in these new environments. The consequences of such behavioural changes for ecosystem processes remain understudied.\\nC_LIO_LIUsing 62 sites of varying urbanisation level, we investigated how species turnover and ITV influenced community-level behavioural responses to urbanisation, using orb web spiders and their webs as models of foraging behaviour.\\nC_LIO_LIITV explained around 30% of the total trait variation observed among communities. Spiders altered their web-building behaviour in cities in ways that increase the capture efficiency of webs. These traits shifts were partly mediated by species turnover, but ITV increased their magnitude. The importance of ITV varied depending on traits and on the spatial scale at which urbanisation was considered. Available prey biomass decreased with urbanisation; the corresponding decrease in prey interception by spiders was less important when ITV in web traits was accounted for.\\nC_LIO_LIBy facilitating trait-environment matching despite urbanisation, ITV thus helps communities to buffer the effects of environmental changes on ecosystem functioning. Despite being often neglected from community-level analyses, our results highlight the importance of accounting for intraspecific trait variation to fully understand trait responses to (human-induced) environmental changes and their impact on ecosystem functioning.\\nC_LI",

Visualizing such big data has posed technical challenges in biology, both in terms of available computational resources as well as programming acumen. Since heatmaps are used to depict high-dimensional numerical data as a colored grid of cells, efficiency and speed have often proven to be critical considerations in the process of successfully converting data into graphics. For example, rendering interactive heatmaps from large input datasets (e.g., 100k+ rows) has been computationally infeasible on both desktop computers and web browsers. In addition to memory requirements, programming skills and knowledge have frequently been barriers-to-entry for creating highly customizable heatmaps.\\n\\nResultsWe propose shinyheatmap: an advanced user-friendly heatmap software suite capable of efficiently creating highly customizable static and interactive biological heatmaps in a web browser. shinyheatmap is a low memory footprint program, making it particularly well-suited for the interactive visualization of extremely large datasets that cannot typically be computed in-memory due to size restrictions.

    "abstract": "Speech-in-noise (SIN) perception is a complex cognitive skill that affects social, vocational, and educational activities. Poor SIN ability particularly affects young and elderly populations, yet varies considerably even among healthy young adults with normal hearing. Although SIN skills are known to be influenced by top-down processes that can selectively enhance lower-level sound representations, the complementary role and of feed-forward mechanisms and their relationship to musical training is poorly understood. Using a paradigm that eliminates the main top-down factors that have been implicated in SIN performance, we aimed to better understand how robust encoding of periodicity in the auditory system (as measured by the frequency-following response) contributes to SIN perception. Using magnetoencephalograpy, we found that the strength of encoding at the fundamental frequency in the brainstem, thalamus, and cortex is correlated with SIN accuracy, as was the amplitude of the slower cortical P2 wave, and these enhancements were related to the extent and timing of musicianship. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that basic feed-forward sound encoding affects SIN perception by providing better information to later processing stages, and that modifying this process may be one mechanism through which musical training might enhance the auditory networks that subserve both musical and language functions.\\n\\nHighlights- Enhancements in periodic sound encoding are correlated with speech-in-noise ability\\n- This effect is observed in the absence of contextual cues and task demands\\n- Better encoding is observed throughout the auditory system and is right-lateralized\\n- Stronger encoding is related to stronger subsequent secondary auditory cortex activity\\n- Musicianship is related to both speech-in-noise perception and enhanced MEG signals",

    "abstract": "The frequency following response (FFR) is a measure of the brains periodic sound encoding. It is of increasing importance for studying the human auditory nervous system due to numerous associations with auditory cognition and dysfunction. Although the FFR is widely interpreted as originating from brainstem nuclei, a recent study using magnetoencephalography (MEG) suggested that there is also a right-lateralized contribution from the auditory cortex at the fundamental frequency (Coffey et al., 2016c). Our objectives in the present work were to validate and better localize this result using a completely different neuroimaging modality, and document the relationships between the FFR and the onset response, and cortical activity. Using a combination of electroencephalography, fMRI, and diffusion-weighted imaging, we show that activity in the right auditory cortex is related to individual differences in FFR-f0 strength, a finding that was replicated with two independent stimulus sets, with and without acoustic energy at the fundamental frequency. We demonstrate a dissociation between this FFR-f0-sensitive response in the right and an area in left auditory cortex that is sensitive to individual differences in the timing of initial response to sound onset. Relationships to timing and their lateralization are supported by parallels in the microstructure of the underlying white matter, implicating a mechanism involving neural conduction efficiency. These data confirm that the FFR has a cortical contribution, and suggest ways in which auditory neuroscience may be advanced by connecting early sound representation to measures of higher-level sound processing and cognitive function.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe frequency following response (FFR) is an electroencephalograph signal that is used to explore how the auditory system encodes temporal regularities in sound, and which is related to differences in auditory function between individuals. It is known that brainstem nuclei contribute to the FFR, but recent findings of an additional cortical source are more controversial. Here, we use functional MRI to validate and extend the prediction from magnetoencephalography data of a right auditory cortex contribution to the FFR. We also demonstrate a dissociation between FFR-related cortical activity from that related to the latency of the response to sound onset, which is found in left auditory cortex. The findings provide a clearer picture of cortical processes for analysis of sound features.",

Bioinformatic analysis of proteomic data reveals that some of the G. obscuriglobus proteins associated with pore-containing membranes possess structural domains found in eukaryote nuclear pore complexes. Moreover, immuno-gold labelling demonstrates localization of one such protein, containing a {beta}-propeller domain, specifically to the G. obscuriglobus pore-like structures.

    "abstract": "Vaccines against Salmonella Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever, are commonly used by travellers, however, there are few examples of national immunization programs in endemic areas. There is therefore a paucity of data on the impact of typhoid immunization programs on localised populations of S. Typhi. Here we have used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to characterise 44 historical bacterial isolates collected before and after a national typhoid immunization program that was implemented in Thailand in 1977 in response to a large outbreak; the program was highly effective in reducing typhoid case numbers. Thai isolates were highly diverse, including 10 distinct phylogenetic lineages or genotypes. Novel prophage and plasmids were also detected, including examples that were previously only reported in Shigella sonnei and Escherichia coli. The majority of S. Typhi genotypes observed prior to the immunization program were not observed following it. Post-vaccine era isolates were more closely related to S. Typhi isolated from neighbouring countries than to earlier Thai isolates, providing no evidence for the local persistence of endemic S. Typhi following the national immunization program. Rather, later cases of typhoid appeared to be caused by the occasional importation of common genotypes from neighbouring Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. These data show the value of WGS in understanding the impacts of vaccination on pathogen populations and provide support for the proposal that large-scale typhoid immunization programs in endemic areas could result in lasting local disease elimination, although larger prospective studies are needed to test this directly.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTyphoid fever is a systemic infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. Typhoid fever is associated with inadequate hygiene in low-income settings and a lack of sanitation infrastructure. A sustained outbreak of typhoid fever occurred in Thailand in the 1970s, which peaked in 1975-1976. In response to this typhoid fever outbreak the government of Thailand initiated an immunization program, which resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of typhoid cases in Thailand. To better understand the population of S. Typhi circulating in Thailand at this time, as well as the impact of the immunization program on the pathogen population, we sequenced the genomes of 44 S. Typhi obtained from hospitals in Thailand before and after the immunization program. The genome sequences showed that isolates of S. Typhi bacteria isolated from post-immunization era typhoid cases were likely imported from neighbouring countries, rather than strains that have persisted in Thailand throughout the immunization period. Our work provides the first historical insights into S. Typhi in Thailand during the 1970s, and provides a model for the impact of immunization on S. Typhi populations.",

We performed a quantitative GWAS for serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) in 2,633 subjects of European and East Asian ancestry and discovered two genome-wide significant loci, in C1GALT1 (rs13226913, P = 3.2 x 10-11) and C1GALT1C1 (rs5910940, P = 2.7 x 10-8). These genes encode molecular partners essential for enzymatic O-glycosylation of IgA1. We demonstrated that these two loci explain approximately 7% of variability in circulating Gd-IgA1 in Europeans, but only 2% in East Asians. Notably, the Gd-IgA1-increasing allele of rs13226913 is common in Europeans, but rare in East Asians. Moreover, rs13226913 represents a strong cis-eQTL for C1GALT1, which encodes the key enzyme responsible for the transfer of galactose to O-linked glycans on IgA1. By in vitro siRNA knock-down studies, we confirmed that mRNA levels of both C1GALT1 and C1GALT1C1 determine the rate of secretion of Gd-IgA1 in IgA1-producing cells. Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of O-glycosylation and are relevant not only to IgA nephropathy, but also to other complex traits associated with O-glycosylation defects, including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic disease, and cancer.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryO-glycosylation is a common type of post-translational modification of proteins; specific abnormalities in the mechanism of O-glycosylation have been implicated in cancer, inflammatory and blood diseases. However, the molecular basis of abnormal O-glycosylation in these complex disorders is not known. We studied the genetic basis of defective O-glycosylation of serum Immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1), which represents the key pathogenic defect in IgA nephropathy, the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. We report our results of the first genome-wide association study for this trait using serum assays in 2,633 individuals of European and East Asian ancestry. In our genome scan, we observed two significant signals with large effects, on chromosomes 7p21.3 and Xq24, jointly explaining about 7% of trait variability. These signals implicate two genes that encode molecular partners essential for enzymatic O-glycosylation of IgA1 and mucins, and represent potential new targets for therapy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBoth genetic and environmental contributions to risk of depression have been identified, but estimates of their effects are limited. Commonalities between major depressive disorder (MDD) and self-declared depression (SDD) are also unclear. Dissecting the genetic and environmental contributions to these traits and their correlation would inform the design and interpretation of genetic studies.\\n\\nMethodsUsing data from a large Scottish family-based cohort (GS:SFHS, N=21,387), we estimated the genetic and environmental contributions to MDD and SDD. Genetic effects associated with common genome-wide genetic variants (SNP heritability) and additional pedigree-associated genetic variation and Non-genetic effects associated with common environments were estimated using linear mixed modeling (LMM).\\n\\nFindingsBoth MDD and SDD had significant contributions from effects of common genetic variants, the additional genetic effect of the pedigree and the common environmental effect shared by couples. The correlation between SDD and MDD was high (r=1*00, se=0*21) for common-variant-associated genetic effects and moderate for both the additional genetic effect of the pedigree (r=0*58, se=0*08) and the couple-shared environmental effect (r=0*53, se=0*22).\\n\\nInterpretationBoth genetics and couple-shared environmental effects were the major factors influencing liability to depression. SDD may provide a scalable alternative to MDD in studies seeking to identify common risk variants. Rarer variants and environmental effects may however differ substantially according to different definitions of depression.\\n\\nFundingStudy supported by Wellcome Trust Strategic Award 104036/Z/14/Z.

    "abstract": "Glycolysis is central to energy metabolism in most organisms, and is highly regulated to enable optimal growth. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, feedback mechanisms that control flux through glycolysis span transcriptional control to metabolite levels in the cell. Using a cellobiose consumption pathway, we decoupled glucose sensing from carbon utilization, revealing new modular layers of control that induce ATP consumption to drive rapid carbon fermentation. Alterations of the beta subunit of phosphofructokinase (PFK2), H+-plasma membrane ATPase (PMA1), and glucose sensors (SNF3, RGT2) revealed the importance of coupling extracellular glucose sensing to manage ATP levels in the cell. Controlling the upper bound of cellular ATP levels may be a general mechanism used to regulate energy levels in cells, via a regulatory network that can be uncoupled from ATP concentrations under perceived starvation conditions.\\n\\nImportanceLiving cells are fine-tuned through evolution to thrive in their native environments. Genome alterations to create organisms for specific biotechnological applications may result in unexpected and undesired phenotypes. We used a minimal synthetic biological system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a platform to reveal novel connections between carbon sensing, starvation conditions and energy homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Pulsed actomyosin contractility underlies diverse modes of tissue morphogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we combine quantitative imaging with genetic perturbations to identify a core mechanism for pulsed contractility in early C. elegans embryos. We show that pulsed accumulation of actomyosin is governed by local control of assembly and disassembly downstream of RhoA. Pulsed activation and inactivation of RhoA precede, respectively, accumulation and disappearance of actomyosin, and persist in the nearly complete absence of Myosin II. We find that fast positive feedback on RhoA activation drives pulse initiation, while F-actin dependent accumulation of the RhoA GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) RGA-3/4 provides delayed negative feedback to terminate each pulse. An experimentally constrained mathematical model confirms that in principle these feedbacks are sufficient to generate locally excitable RhoA dynamics. We propose that excitable RhoA dynamics are a common driver for pulsed contractility that can be differently tuned or coupled to actomyosin dynamics to produce a diversity of morphogenetic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Efficient collective migration depends on a balance between contractility and cytoskeletal rearrangements, adhesion, and mechanical cell-cell communication, all controlled by GTPases of the RHO family. By comprehensive screening of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) in human bronchial epithelial cell monolayers, we identified GEFs that are required for collective migration at large, such as SOS1 and {beta}-PIX, and RHOA GEFs that are implicated in intercellular communication. Downregulation of the latter GEFs differentially enhanced front-to-back propagation of guidance cues through the monolayer, and was mirrored by downregulation of RHOA expression and myosin-II activity. Phenotype-based clustering of knock-down behaviors identified RHOA-ARHGEF18 and ARHGEF3-ARHGEF28-ARHGEF11 clusters, indicating that the latter may signal through other RHO-family GTPases. Indeed, knock-down of RHOC produced an intermediate between the two phenotypes. We conclude that for effective collective migration the RHOA-GEFs-[-&gt;]ARHOA/C[-&gt;] actomyosin pathways must be optimally tuned to compromise between generation of motility forces and restriction of intercellular communication.",

    "abstract": "Studies attempting to functionally interpret complex-disease susceptibility loci by GWAS and eQTL integration have predominantly employed microarrays to quantify gene-expression. RNA-Seq has the potential to discover a more comprehensive set of eQTLs and illuminate the underlying molecular consequence. We examine the functional outcome of 39 variants associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) through integration of GWAS and eQTL data from the TwinsUK microarray and RNA-Seq cohort in lymphoblastoid cell lines. We use conditional analysis and a Bayesian colocalisation method to provide evidence of a shared causal-variant, then compare the ability of each quantification type to detect disease relevant eQTLs and eGenes. We discovered a greater frequency of candidate-causal eQTLs using RNA-Seq, and identified novel SLE susceptibility genes that were concealed using microarrays (e.g. NADSYN1, SKP1, and TCF7). Many of these eQTLs were found to influence the expression of several genes, suggesting risk haplotypes may harbour multiple functional effects. We pinpointed eQTLs modulating expression of four non-coding RNAs; three of which were replicated in whole-blood. Novel SLE associated splicing events were identified in the T-reg restricted transcription factor, IKZF2, the autophagy-related gene WDFY4, and the redox coenzyme NADSYN1, through asQTL mapping using the Geuvadis cohort. We have significantly increased our understanding of the genetic control of gene-expression in SLE by maximising the leverage of RNA-Seq and performing integrative GWAS-eQTL analysis against gene, exon, and splice-junction quantifications. In doing so, we have identified novel SLE candidate genes and specific molecular mechanisms that will serve as the basis for targeted follow-up studies.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules contribute to many cellular processes, including transport, signaling, and chromosome separation during cell division (Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015). They are comprised of {beta}-tubulin heterodimers arranged into linear protofilaments and assembled into tubes. Eukaryotes express multiple tubulin isoforms (Gogonea et al., 1999), and there has been a longstanding debate as to whether the isoforms are redundant or perform specialized roles as part of a tubulin code (Fulton and Simpson, 1976). Here, we use the well-characterized touch receptor neurons (TRNs) of Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate this question, through genetic dissection of process outgrowth both in vivo and in vitro. With single-cell RNA-seq, we compare transcription profiles for TRNs with those of two other sensory neurons, and present evidence that each sensory neuron expresses a distinct palette of tubulin genes. In the TRNs, we analyze process outgrowth and show that four tubulins (tba-1, tba-2, tbb-1, and tbb-2) function partially or fully redundantly, while two others (mec-7 and mec-12) perform specialized, context-dependent roles. Our findings support a model in which sensory neurons express overlapping subsets of tubulin genes whose functional redundancy varies between cell types and in vivo and in vitro contexts.\\n\\nHighlight SummaryMicrotubules contribute to key cellular processes and are composed of {beta}-tubulin heterodimers.

    "abstract": "Background: We have identified molecules that exhibit synthetic lethality in cells with loss of the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene. However, recognizing tumors that have inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor function is challenging because the loss may occur via mechanisms that do not involve mutation of the genomic locus. Degradation of the NF1 protein, independent of NF1 mutation status, photocopies inactivating mutations to drive tumors in human glioma cell lines. NF1 inactivation may alter the transcriptional landscape of a tumor and allow a machine learning classifier to detect which tumors will benefit from synthetic lethal molecules.\\n\\nResults: We developed a strategy to predict tumors with low NF1 activity and hence tumors that may respond to treatments that target cells lacking NF1. Using RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we trained an ensemble of 500 logistic regression classifiers that integrates mutation status with whole transcriptomes to predict NF1 inactivation in glioblastoma (GBM). On TCGA data, the classifier detected NF1 mutated tumors (test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) mean = 0.77, 95% quantile = 0.53 - 0.95) over 50 random initializations. On RNA-Seq data transformed into the space of gene expression microarrays, this method produced a classifier with similar performance (test set AUROC mean = 0.77, 95% quantile = 0.53 - 0.96). We applied our ensemble classifier trained on the transformed TCGA data to a microarray validation set of 12 samples with matched RNA and NF1 protein-level measurements. The classifiers NF1 score was associated with NF1 protein concentration in these samples.\\n\\nConclusions: We demonstrate that TCGA can be used to train accurate predictors of NF1 inactivation in GBM. The ensemble classifier performed well for samples with very high or very low NF1 protein concentrations but had mixed performance in samples with intermediate NF1 concentrations. Nevertheless, high-performing and validated predictors have the potential to be paired with targeted therapies and personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "MotivationHigh throughput sequencing methods produce massive amounts of data. The most common first step in interpretation of these data is to map the data to genomic intervals and then overlap with genome annotations. A major interest in computational genomics is spatial genome-wide correlation among genomic features (e.g. between transcription and histone modification). The key hypothesis here is that features that are similarly distributed along a genome may be functionally related.\\n\\nResultsHere, we propose a method that rapidly estimates genomewide correlation of genomic annotations; these annotations can be derived from high throughput experiments, databases, or other means. The method goes far beyond the simple overlap and proximity tests that are commonly used, by enabling correlation of continuous data, so that the loss of data that occurs upon reduction to intervals is unnecessary. To include analysis of nonoverlapping but spatially related features, we use kernel correlation. Implementation of this method allows for correlation analysis of two or three profiles across the human genome in a few minutes on a personal computer. Another novel and extraordinarily powerful feature of our approach is the local correlation track output that enables overlap with other correlations (correlation of correlations). We applied our method to the datasets from the Human Epigenome Atlas and FANTOM CAGE. We observed the changes of the correlation between epigenomic features across developmental trajectories of several tissue types, and found unexpected strong spatial correlation of CAGE clusters with splicing donor sites and with poly(A) sites.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe StereoGene C++ source code, program documentation, Galaxy integration scrips and examples are available at the project homepage at http://stereogene.bioinf.fbb.msu.ru/\\n\\nContactfavorov@sensi.org\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available online.",
