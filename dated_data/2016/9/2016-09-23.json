    "abstract": "Entropy rising within normal hematopoiesis is the core idea of the proposed thermodynamical model of malignancy in leukemia. Mathematically its description is supposed to be similar to the Lorenz system of ordinary differential equations for simplified processes of heat flow in fluids. The model provides description of remission and relapse in leukemia as two hierarchical and qualitatively different states of normal hematopoiesis with their own phase spaces. Phase space transition is possible through pitchfork bifurcation, which is considered as the common symmetrical scenario for relapse, induced remission and spontaneous remission of leukemia. Cytopenia is regarded as an adaptive reaction of hematopoiesis to entropy increase caused by leukemia clone. The following hypotheses are formulated: a) Percentage of leukemia cells in marrow as criterion of remission or relapse is not necessarily constant but a variable value; b) Probability of getting remission depends upon normal hematopoiesis reaching bifurcation; c) Duration of remission depends upon eradication of leukemia cells in induction or consolidation therapies; d) Excessively high doses of chemotherapy in consolidation might induce relapse.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscriptome interpretation relies on a good-quality reference transcriptome for accurate quantification of gene expression as well as functional analysis of genetic variants. The current annotation of the horse genome lacks the specificity and sensitivity necessary to assess gene expression especially at the isoform level, and suffers from insufficient annotation of untranslated regions (UTR). We built an annotation pipeline for horse and used it to integrate 1.9 billion reads from multiple RNA-seq data sets into a new refined transcriptome.\\n\\nResultsThis equine transcriptome integrates eight different tissues from 59 individuals and improves gene structure and isoform resolution while providing considerable tissue-specific information. We utilized four levels of transcript filtration in our pipeline, aimed at producing several transcriptome versions that are suitable for different downstream analyses. Our most refined transcriptome includes 36,876 genes and 76,125 isoforms, with 6474 candidate transcriptional loci novel to the equine transcriptome.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have employed a variety of descriptive statistics and figures that demonstrate the quality and content of the transcriptome. The equine transcriptomes that are provided by this pipeline show the best tissue-specific resolution of any equine transcriptome to date and can serve several types of downstream analyses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe widespread use of individual sires for artificial insemination promotes the propagation of recessive conditions. Inadvertent matings between unnoticed carriers of deleterious alleles may result in the manifestation of fatal phenotypes in their progeny. Breeding consultants and farmers reported on Vorderwald calves with a congenital skin disease. The clinical findings in affected calves were compatible with epidermolysis bullosa.\\n\\nResultsPedigree analysis indicated autosomal recessive inheritance of epidermolysis bullosa in Vorderwald cattle. We genotyped two diseased and 41 healthy animals at 41,436 single nucleotide polymorphisms and performed whole-genome haplotype-based association testing, which allowed us to map the locus responsible for the skin disease to the distal end of bovine chromosome 22 (P=8.0x10-14). The analysis of whole-genome re-sequencing data of one diseased calf, three obligate mutation carriers and 1682 healthy animals from various bovine breeds revealed a nonsense mutation (rs876174537, p.Arg1588X) in the COL7A1 gene that segregates with the disease. The same mutation was previously detected in three calves with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa from the Rotes H[o]ehenvieh cattle breed. We show that diseased animals from Vorderwald and Rotes H[o]ehenvieh cattle are identical by descent for an 8.72 Mb haplotype encompassing rs876174537 indicating they inherited the deleterious allele from a recent common ancestor.\\n\\nConclusionsAutosomal recessive epidermolysis bullosa in Vorderwald and Rotes H[o]ehenvieh cattle is caused by a nonsense mutation in the COL7A1 gene. Our findings demonstrate that recessive deleterious alleles may segregate across cattle populations without apparent admixture. The identification of the causal mutation now enables the reliable detection of carriers of the defective allele. Genome-based mating strategies can avoid inadvertent matings of carrier animals thereby preventing the birth of homozygous calves that suffer from a painful skin disease.",

    "abstract": "The clinical diagnosis and symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) have been closely associated with impairments in reward processing. In particular, various studies have shown blunted neural and behavioral responses to the experience of reward in depression. However, little is known about whether depression affects individuals valuation of potential rewards during decision-making, independent from reward experience. To address this question, we used a gambling task and a model-based analytic approach to measure two types of individual sensitivity to reward values in participants with MDD:  risk preference, indicating how objective values are subjectively perceived and  inverse temperature, determining the degree to which subjective value differences between options influences participants choices. On both of these measures of value sensitivity, participants with MDD were comparable to non-psychiatric controls. Both risk preference and inverse temperature were also stable over four laboratory visits and comparable between the groups at each visit. Moreover, neither value sensitivity measure varied with severity of clinical symptoms in MDD. These data suggest intact and stable value processing in MDD during risky decision-making.",

Data-driven modeling plays a central role in systems pharmacology, and has already enabled biologists to generate novel hypotheses. However, more is needed. The drug response is associated with genetic/epigenetic variants and environmental factors, is coupled with molecular conformational dynamics, is affected by possible off-targets, is modulated by the complex interplay of biological networks, and is dependent on pharmacokinetics. Thus, in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of drug actions, systems pharmacology requires integration of models across data modalities, methodologies, organismal hierarchies, and species. This imposes a great challenge on model management, integration, and translation. Here, we discuss several upcoming issues in systems pharmacology and potential solutions to them using big data technology. It will allow systems pharmacology modeling to be findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable, reliable, interpretable, and actionable.",

    "abstract": "High-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) is an emerging brain imaging technique that can permit investigating fast dynamics of cortical electrical activity in the healthy and the diseased human brain. Its applications are however currently limited by a number of methodological issues, among which the difficulty in obtaining accurate source localizations. In particular, these issues have so far prevented EEG studies from showing brain networks similar to those previously detected by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Here, we report for the first time a robust detection of brain networks from resting state (256-channel) hdEEG recordings. Specifically, we obtained 14 networks previously described in fMRI studies by means of realistic 12-layer head models and eLORETA source localization, together with ICA for functional connectivity analysis. Our analyses revealed three important methodological aspects. First, brain network reconstruction can be improved by performing source localization using the cortex as source space, instead of the whole brain. Second, conducting EEG connectivity analyses in individual space rather than on concatenated datasets may be preferable, as it permits to incorporate realistic information on head modeling and electrode positioning. Third, the use of a wide frequency band leads to an unbiased and generally accurate reconstruction of several network maps, whereas filtering data in a narrow frequency band may enhance the detection of specific networks and penalize that of others. We hope that our methodological work will contribute to rise of hdEEG as a powerful tool for brain research.",

This simplification allowed derivation of simple analytical relations between parameters representing axon density, v and dispersion,{tau} , and DTI invariants (MD and FA) through moment expansion of the NODDI-DTI signal model. These relations formally allow extraction of biophysical parameters from DTI data. It should be emphasised that the NODDI-DTI model inherits the strong assumptions of the NODDI model, and so is nominally restricted to analysis of healthy brains.\\n\\nNODDI-DTI parameter estimates were computed by applying the proposed analytical relations to DTI parameters extracted from the first shell of data, and compared to parameters extracted by fitting the NODDI-DTI model to (i) both shells (recommended) and (ii) the first shell (as for DTI) of data in the white matter of three different in vivo diffusion datasets. NODDI-DTI parameters estimated from DTI and NODDI-DTI parameters estimated by fitting the model to the first shell of data gave similar errors compared to two-shell NODDI-DTI estimates. The NODDI-DTI method gave unphysical parameter estimates in a small percentage of voxels, reflecting voxelwise DTI estimation error or NODDI-DTI model invalidity. In the course of evaluating the NODDI-DTI model it was found that diffusional kurtosis strongly biased DTI-based MD values, and so a novel heuristic correction requiring only DTI data was derived and used to account for this bias.\\n\\nOur results demonstrate that NODDI-DTI is a promising model and technique to interpret restricted datasets acquired for DTI analysis with greater biophysical specificity, though its limitations must be borne in mind.",

    "abstract": "Belted cattle have a circular belt of unpigmented hair and skin around their midsection. The belt is inherited as a monogenic autosomal dominant trait. We mapped the causative variant to a 54 kb segment on bovine chromosome 3. Whole genome sequence data of 2 belted and 130 control cattle yielded only one private genetic variant in the critical interval in the two belted animals. The belt-associated variant was a copy number variant (CNV) involving the quadruplication of a 6 kb non-coding sequence located approximately 16 kb upstream of the TWIST2 gene. Increased copy numbers at this CNV were strongly associated with the belt phenotype in a cohort of 239 cases and 1303 controls (p = 1.3 x 10-278). We hypothesized that the CNV causes aberrant expression of TWIST2 during neural crest development, which might negatively affect melanoblasts. Functional studies showed that ectopic expression of bovine TWIST2 in neural crest in transgenic zebrafish led to a decrease in melanocyte numbers. Our results thus implicate an unsuspected involvement of TWIST2 in regulating pigmentation and reveal a non-coding CNV underlying a captivating Mendelian character.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBelted cattle, a spontaneous coat color mutant, have been recognized at least 600 years ago. The striking pigmentation pattern probably has arisen in medieval cattle of the Alpine region. The belt still segregates in Brown Swiss cattle and it has become a breed-defining character in the Lakenvelder or Dutch Belted cattle. The belted allele has also been introgressed into Galloways to form the Belted Galloways. We report here the causative genetic variant, a non-coding copy number variant (CNV) upstream of the TWIST2 gene. We hypothesize that the CNV leads to ectopic expression of TWIST2 in the neural crest, which negatively affects melanocyte development. Overexpression of bovine TWIST2 in transgenic zebrafish embryos led to a decrease in melanocyte numbers, which provides functional support for our hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Thomas Kent was an Irish rebel who was executed by the British forces in the aftermath of the Rising armed insurrection of 1916 and buried in a shallow grave on Cork prison's grounds. In 2015, ninety-nine years after his death, a state funeral was offered to his living family to honor his role in the struggle for Irish independence. However, due to inaccuracies in record keeping, the bodily remains from Cork prison that supposedly belonged to Kent could not be identified with absolute certainty. At the request of the Irish National Police (An Garda Siochana), we identified the remains presumed to be those of Kent using a novel method that compared homozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms obtained from next-generation shotgun sequencing with genetic data from two of Kent's known living relatives who share with him a third degree relationship. DNA degradation resulted in low sequence depth of Thomas Kent's DNA and only a few loci appeared as heterozygous, rendering traditional methods of relatedness estimation unusable. To remove potential bias, all loci were therefore analysed as homozygous, leading to a process we refer to as \\\"forced homozygote approach\\\". This procedure reduces the expected degree of relatedness to half of what is expected when heterozygotes are included; thus, Kent had a relationship coefficient (Queller and Goodnight's Rxy) of 12.5% with his third-degree relatives instead of the expected 25%. The results were confirmed using simulated data for different relatedness classes (2000 simulated individuals per class), also confirming Thomas Kent's identity. We argue that this method provides a necessary alternative for relatedness estimations, not only in forensic analysis, but also in ancient DNA studies, where reduced amounts of genetic information can limit the application of traditional methods.",

    "abstract": "Verticillium wilt, caused by soil-borne fungi of the genus Verticillium, is an economically important disease that affects a wide range of host plants. Unfortunately, host resistance against Verticillium wilts is not available for many plant species, and the disease is notoriously difficult to combat. Host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) is an RNA interference (RNAi) based process in which small RNAs are produced by the host plant to target parasite transcripts. HIGS has emerged as a promising strategy for improving plant resistance against pathogens by silencing genes that are essential for these pathogens. Here, we assessed whether HIGS can be utilized to suppress Verticillium wilt disease by silencing previously identified virulence genes of V. dahliae through the host plants tomato and Arabidopsis. In transient assays, tomato plants were agroinfiltrated with Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) constructs to target V. dahliae transcripts. Subsequent V. dahliae inoculation revealed suppression of Verticillium wilt disease in some, but not all, cases. Next, expression of RNAi constructs targeting V. dahliae transcripts was pursued in stable transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Also in this host, V. dahliae inoculation revealed reduced Verticillium wilt disease in some cases. Thus, our study suggests that, depending on the target gene chosen, HIGS against V. dahliae is operational in tomato and A. thaliana plants and may act as a plant protection approach that may be used in Verticillium wilt-susceptible crops.",

Using synthetic pathogen-like particles (PLPs) that mimic physical properties of bacteria or large-viruses, we have discovered that the quality and quantity of Toll-like-receptor-9 (TLR9)-signaling by CpG in mouse dendritic cells (mDC) is uniquely dependent on biophysical attributes, specifically the surface-density of CpG and size of the presenting PLP. These physical patterns control DC-programming by regulating kinetics and magnitude of MyD88-IRAK4 signaling, NF{kappa}B-driven responses, and STAT3 phosphorylation, which in turn controls differential T cell responses and in vivo immune-polarization, especially T-helper 1 (Th1) versus T-helper 2 (Th2) antibody responses. Our findings suggest that innate immune cells can sense and respond not only to molecular, but also pathogen-associated physical patterns (PAPPs), broadening the tools for modulating immunity, helping to better understand innate response mechanisms to pathogens and develop new and improved vaccines.",

Imaging-based measurements may either use 2 dimensional datasets or 3D datasets including the z-axis information in image stacks. Here we compare the suitability of 2D versus 3D distance measurements in the analysis of various features of spatial genome organization. We find in general good agreement between 2D and 3D analysis with higher convergence of measurements as the interrogated distance increases, especially in flat cells. Overall, 3D distance measurements are more accurate than 2D distances, but are also more prone to noise. In particular, z-stacks are prone to error due to imaging properties such as limited resolution along the z-axis and optical aberrations, and we also find significant deviations from unimodal distance distributions caused by low sampling frequency in z. These deviations can be ameliorated by sampling at much higher frequency in the z-direction. We conclude that 2D distances are preferred for comparative analyses between cells, but 3D distances are preferred when comparing to theoretical models in large samples of cells. In general, 2D distance measurements remain preferable for many applications of analysis of spatial genome organization.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDHuntingtons Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease causing severe neurodegeneration of the striatum as well as marked cognitive and motor disabilities. Excitotoxicity, caused by overstimulation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) has been shown to have a key role in the neuropathogenesis of HD, suggesting that targeting NMDAR-dependent signaling may be an effective clinical approach for HD. However, broad NMDAR antagonists are generally poor therapeutics in clinical practice. It has been suggested that GluN2A-containing, synaptically located NMDARs activate cell survival signaling pathways, while GluN2B-containing, primarily extrasynaptic NMDARs trigger cell death signaling. A better approach to development of effective therapeutics for HD may be to target, specifically, the cell-death specific pathways associated with extrasynaptic GluN2B NMDAR activation, while maintaining or potentiating the cell-survival activity of GluN2A-NMDARs.\\n\\nOBJECTIVEThis review outlines the role of NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity in HD and overviews current efforts to develop better therapeutics for HD where NMDAR excitotoxicity is the target.\\n\\nMETHODSA systematic review process was conducted using the PubMed search engine focusing on research conducted in the past 5-10 years. 250 articles were consulted for the review, with key search terms including \\\"Huntingtons Disease\\\", \\\"excitotoxicity\\\", \\\"NMDAR\\\" and \\\"therapeutics\\\".\\n\\nRESULTSA wide range of NMDAR excitotoxicity-based targets for HD were identified and reviewed, including targeting NMDARs directly by blocking GluN2B, extrasynaptic NMDARs and/or potentiating GluN2A, synaptic NMDARs, targeting glutamate release or uptake, or targeting specific downstream cell-death signaling of NMDARs.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONThe current review identifies NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity as a key player in HD pathogenesis and points to various excitotoxicity-focused targets as potential future preventative therapeutics for HD.",

    "abstract": "Summary SentenceSpatially explicit footprints make it possible to locate biodiversity hotspots linked to global supply chains.\\n\\nIdentifying species threat hotspots has been a successful approach for setting conservation priorities. One major challenge in conservation is that in many hotspots export industries continue to drive overexploitation. Conservation measures must consider not just the point of impact, but also the consumer demand that ultimately drives resource use. To understand which species threat hotspots are driven by which consumers, we have developed a new approach to link a set of biodiversity footprint accounts to the hotspots of threatened species on the IUCN Red List. The result is a map connecting global supply chains to impact locations. Connecting consumption to spatially explicit hotspots driven by production has not been done before on a global scale. Locating biodiversity threat hotspots driven by consumption of goods and services can help connect conservationists, consumers, companies, and governments in order to better target conservation actions.",

    "abstract": "Recently it has become feasible to detect long blocks of almost identical sequence shared between pairs of genomes. These so called IBD-blocks are direct traces of recent coalescence events, and as such contain ample signal for inferring recent demography. Here, we examine sharing of such blocks in two-dimensional populations with local migration. Using a diffusion approximation to trace genetic ancestry back in time, we derive analytical formulas for patterns of isolation by distance of long IBD-blocks, which can also incorporate recent population density changes. As a main result, we introduce an inference scheme that uses a composite likelihood approach to fit observed block sharing to these formulas. We assess our inference method on simulated block sharing data under several standard population genetics models. We first validate the diffusion approximation by showing that the theoretical results closely match simulated block sharing patterns. We then show that our inference scheme rather accurately and robustly recovers estimates of the dispersal rate and effective density, as well as bounds on recent dynamics of population density. To demonstrate an application, we use our estimation scheme to explore the fit of a diffusion model to Eastern European samples in the POPRES data set. We show that ancestry diffusing with a rate of [Formula] during the last centuries, combined with accelerating population growth, can explain the observed exponential decay of block sharing with pairwise sample distance.",

    "abstract": "The timing of puberty is a highly polygenic childhood trait that is epidemiologically associated with various adult diseases. Here, we analyse 1000-Genome reference panel imputed genotype data on up to ~370,000 women and identify 389 independent signals (all P<5x10-8) for age at menarche, a notable milestone in female pubertal development. In Icelandic data from deCODE, these signals explain ~7.4% of the population variance in age at menarche, corresponding to one quarter of the estimated heritability. We implicate over 250 genes via coding variation or associated gene expression, and demonstrate enrichment across genes active in neural tissues. We identify multiple rare variants near the imprinted genes MKRN3 and DLK1 that exhibit large effects on menarche only when paternally inherited. Disproportionate effects of variants on early or late puberty timing are observed: single variant and heritability estimates are larger for early than late puberty timing in females. The opposite pattern is seen in males, with larger estimates for late than early puberty timing. Mendelian randomization analyses indicate causal inverse associations, independent of BMI, between puberty timing and risks for breast and endometrial cancers in women, and prostate cancer in men. In aggregate, our findings reveal new complexity in the genetic regulation of puberty timing and support new causal links with adult cancer risks.",

    "abstract": "Niemann Pick C disease (NPC) is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to excessive storage of cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomes and lysosomes. The large majority of NPC disease is caused by mutations in NPC1, a large polytopic membrane protein that functions in late endosomes. There are many disease-associated mutations in NPC1, and most patients are compound heterozygotes. The most common mutation NPC1I1061T has been shown to cause endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation of the NPC1 protein. Treatment of patient derived NPC1I1061T fibroblasts with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) Vorinostat or Panobinostat increases expression of the mutant NPC1 protein and leads to correction of the cholesterol storage. Herein we show that several other human NPC1 mutant fibroblast cell lines can also be corrected by Vorinostat or Panobinostat and that treatment with Vorinostat extends the lifetime of the NPC1I1061T protein. To test effects of HDACi on a large number of NPC1 mutants, we engineered a U2OS cell line to suppress NPC1 expression by shRNA and then transiently transfected these cells with 81 different NPC1 mutant constructs. The mutant NPC1 did not significantly reduce cholesterol accumulation, but approximately 80% of the mutants showed reduced cholesterol accumulation when treated with Vorinostat or Panobinostat.",

    "abstract": "Here, we describe an expansion of the DNA size limitations associated with CRISPR knock-in technology, more specifically, the physical extent to which mouse genomic DNA can be replaced with donor (in this case, human) DNA at an orthologous locus. Driving our efforts was the desire to create a whole animal model that would replace 17 kbp of the mouse Bcl2l11 gene with the corresponding 25-kbp segment of human BCL2L11, including a conditionally removable segment (2.9-kbp) of intron 2, a cryptic human exon immediately 3' of this, and a native human exon some 20 kbp downstream. Using two methods, we first carried out the replacement by employing a combination of bacterial artificial chromosome recombineering, classic ES cell targeting, dual selection, and recombinase-driven cassette removal (traditional approach). Using a unique second method, we employed the same vector (devoid of its selectable marker cassettes), microinjecting it along with CRISPR RNA guides and Cas9 into mouse zygotes (CRISPR approach). In both instances we were able to achieve humanization of Bcl2l11 to the extent designed, remove all selection cassettes, and demonstrate the functionality of the conditionally removable, loxP-flanked, 2.9-kbp intronic segment.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology can be used to place DNA sequences (designed in the laboratory) into the genomes of living organisms. Here, we describe a new method, whereby we have replaced an exceptionally large segment of the mouse Bcl2l11 gene with the corresponding segment of human BCL2L11 gene. The method represents an expansion of the DNA size limitations typically associated with the introduction of DNA sequences through traditional CRISPR methods.",
