    "abstract": "The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been proposed to contribute to circadian regulation of sleepiness by increasing in the blood at night to signal for sleepiness. Earlier studies have reported diurnal variations of IL-6, but phase estimates are conflicting. We have therefore performed a meta-analysis on the diurnal variation of circulating IL-6. Studies were included if they reported circulating levels of IL-6 recorded at least twice within 24 hours in the same individual. A systematic search resulted in the inclusion of 43 studies with 56 datasets, for a total of 1100 participants. Individual participant data were available from 4 datasets with a total of 56 participants. Mixed-effects meta-regression modelling confirmed that IL-6 varied across the day, the most conspicuous effect being a trough in the morning. These results stand in contrast to earlier findings of a peak in the evening or night, and suggest that diurnal variation should be taken into account in order to avoid confounding in studies of IL-6 in plasma or serum.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDe novo inference of clinically relevant gene function relationships from tumor RNA-seq remains a challenging task. Current methods typically either partition patient samples into a few subtypes or rely upon analysis of pairwise gene correlations (co-expression) that will miss some groups in noisy data. Leveraging higher dimensional information can be expected to increase the power to discern targetable pathways, but this is commonly thought to be an intractable computational problem.\\n\\nMethodsIn this work we adapt a recently developed machine learning algorithm, CorEx, that efficiently optimizes over multivariate mutual information for sensitive detection of complex gene relationships. The algorithm can be iteratively applied to generate a hierarchy of latent factors. Patients are stratified relative to each factor and combinatoric survival analyses are performed and interpreted in the context of biological function annotations and protein network interactions that might be utilized to match patients to multiple therapies.\\n\\nResultsAnalysis of ovarian tumor RNA-seq samples demonstrates the algorithms power to infer well over one hundred biologically interpretable gene cohorts, several times more than standard methods such as hierarchical clustering and k-means. The CorEx factor hierarchy is also informative, with related but distinct gene clusters grouped by upper nodes. Some latent factors correlate with patient survival, including one for a pathway connected with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer that is regulated by a potentially druggable microRNA. Further, combinations of factors lead to a synergistic survival advantage in some cases.\\n\\nConclusionsIn contrast to studies that attempt to partition patients into a small number of subtypes (typically 4 or fewer) for treatment purposes, our approach utilizes subgroup information for combinatoric transcriptional phenotyping. Considering only the 66 gene expression groups that are both found to have significant Gene Ontology enrichment and are small enough to indicate specific drug targets implies a computational phenotype for ovarian cancer that allows for 366 possible patient profiles, enabling truly personalized treatment. The findings here demonstrate a new technique that sheds light on the complexity of gene expression dependencies in tumors and could eventually enable the use of patient RNA-seq profiles for selection of personalized and effective cancer treatments.",

    "abstract": "Biological predispositions influence approach and avoid responses since the beginning of life. Neonates of species that require parental care (e.g. human babies and chicks of the domestic fowl) are attracted by stimuli associated with animate social partners, such as face-like configurations, biological motion and self-propulsion. The property of being filled is used as a cue of animacy by 8-month-old infants but it is not known whether this reflects the effect of previous experience. We use chicks of the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus) to investigate whether the property of being filled vs. hollow elicits spontaneous or learned preferences. To this aim we tested preferences of naIve and imprinted chicks for hollow and closed cylinders. Contrary to our expectations, we documented an unlearned attraction for hollow stimuli. The preference for hollow stimuli decreased when chicks were imprinted on filled stimuli but did not increase when chicks were imprinted on hollow stimuli, suggesting that this feature is not crucial to categorize the familiarity of imprinting objects. When chicks were imprinted on occluded stimuli that could be either filled or hollow, the preference for hollow stimuli emerged again, showing that imprinting does not disrupt the spontaneous preference for hollow objects. Further experiments revealed that hollow objects were mainly attractive by means of depth cues such as darker innards, more than as places to hide or as objects with high contrast. Our findings point to predisposed preferences for hollow objects that might be unrelated to social behaviour.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 full-length, unspliced genomic RNAs (gRNAs) serve both as mRNAs encoding the Gag and Gag-Pol capsid proteins as well as the genetic material packaged by Gag into virions that assemble at the plasma membrane (PM). Whether localized Gag synthesis contributes to assembly at the PM is unknown. Here we show that artificially tethering gRNAs or surrogate gag-pol mRNAs to non-PM membranes or the actin cytoskeleton can markedly affect Gags distribution in the cytoplasm, causing aberrant subcellular sites of assembly and severe reductions to virus particle output. Only gag-pol mRNAs competent for translation were capable of altering Gags distribution within the cell, and the activity mapped to two cis-acting RNA regulatory elements; the 5 packaging signal (Psi) bound by Gag and, unexpectedly, the Rev response element (RRE) that regulates the nuclear export of gRNAs and other intron-retaining viral RNAs. Taken together, our results suggest a model wherein localized translation of gRNAs at the PM helps to compartmentalize Gag-gRNA interactions, thereby promoting efficient genome encapsidation.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe spatial distribution of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) within the cytoplasm can be a crucial determinant of gene expression. Here we provide evidence that a devastating viral pathogen, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), exploits localized translation to favor the formation of infectious, transmissible virions at the surface of infected cells. Artificially tethering viral mRNAs encoding the Gag and Gag-Pol capsid proteins (gag-pol mRNAs) to alternative regions of the cell such as cytoplasmic vesicles or the actin cytoskeletion markedly alters Gag subcellular distribution, perturbs sites of assembly, and reduces virus particle production. These and additional findings suggest a model for HIV-1 assembly wherein localized Gag/Gag-Pol translation coupled to confined interactions between Gag and viral genomes ensures infectious virion production at the right place and the right time. Perturbing HIV-1 mRNA subcellular localization could represent a novel antiviral strategy.",

    "abstract": "Explorations of complex microbiomes using genomics greatly enhance our understanding about their diversity, biogeography, and function. The isolation of DNA from microbiome specimens is a key prerequisite for such examinations, but challenges remain in obtaining sufficient DNA quantities required for certain sequencing approaches, achieving accurate genomic inference of microbiome composition, and facilitating comparability of findings across specimen types and sequencing projects. These aspects are particularly relevant for the genomics-based global surveillance of infectious agents and antimicrobial resistance from different reservoirs. Here, we compare in a stepwise approach a total of eight commercially available DNA extraction kits and 16 procedures based on these for three specimen types (human feces, pig feces, and hospital sewage). We assess DNA extraction using spike-in controls, and different types of beads for bead-beating facilitating cell lysis. We evaluate DNA concentration, purity, and stability, and microbial community composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and for selected samples using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Our results suggest that inferred community composition was dependent on inherent specimen properties as well as DNA extraction method. We further show that bead-beating or enzymatic treatment can increase the extraction of DNA from Gram-positive bacteria. Final DNA quantities could be increased by isolating DNA from a larger volume of cell lysate compared to standard protocols. Based on this insight, we designed an improved DNA isolation procedure optimized for microbiome genomics that can be used for the three examined specimen types and potentially also for other biological specimens. A standard operating procedure is available from: https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3475406.\\n\\nIMPORTANCESequencing-based analyses of microbiomes may lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of the microbial world associate with humans, animals, and the environment. Such insight could further the development of innovative ecosystem management approaches for the protection of our natural resources, and the design of more effective and sustainable solutions to prevent and control infectious diseases. Genome sequence information is an organism- (pathogen-) independent language that can be used across sectors, space, and time. Harmonized standards, protocols, and workflows for sample processing and analysis can facilitate the generation of such actionable information. In this study, we assessed several procedures for the isolation of DNA for next-generation sequencing. Our study highlights several important aspects to consider in the design and conduction of sequence-based analysis of microbiomes. We provide a standard operating procedure for the isolation of DNA from a range of biological specimens particularly relevant in clinical diagnostics and epidemiology.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel way to select for highly polygenic traits. For millennia, humans have used observable phenotypes to selectively breed stronger or more productive livestock and crops. Selection on genotype, using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and quantitative trait loci (QTLs), is also now applied broadly in livestock breeding programs; however, selection on protein or mRNA expression markers have not been proved useful yet. Here we demonstrate the utility of protein markers to select for disease-resistant behaviour in the European honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Robust, mechanistically-linked protein expression markers, by integrating cis and trans effects from many genomic loci, may overcome limitations of genomic markers to allow for selection. After three generations of selection, the resulting stock performed as well or better than bees selected using phenotype-based assessment of this trait, when challenged with disease. This is the first demonstration of the efficacy of protein markers for selective breeding in any agricultural species, plant or animal.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe honey bee has been in the news a lot recently, largely because of world-wide die-offs due to the parasitic Varroa mite, which is becoming resistant to the chemical controls the bee industry uses. In this study, we show that robust expression biomarkers of a disease-resistance trait can be used, in an out-bred population, to select for that trait. After three generations of selection, the resulting stock performed as well or better than bees selected using the phenotypic best method for assessing this trait when challenged with disease. This is the first demonstration of an expression marker for selective breeding in any agricultural species, plant or animal. This also represents a completely novel way to select for highly polygenic traits.",

    "abstract": "Major companies, healthcare professionals, the military, and other scientists and innovators are now sensing that fitness and health data from wearable biosensors will likely provide new discoveries and insights into physiological, cognitive, and emotional health status of an individual. Having the ability to collect, process, and correlate data simultaneously from a set of heterogonous biosensor sources may be a key factor in informing the development of new technologies for reducing health risks, improving health status, and possibly preventing and predicting disease. The challenge in achieving this is getting easy access to heterogeneous data from a set of disparate sensors in a single, integrated wearable monitoring system. Often times, the data recorded by commercial biosensing devices are contained within each manufacturers proprietary platform. Summary data is available for some devices as free downloads or included only in annual premium memberships. Access to raw measurements is generally unavailable, especially from a custom developed application that may include prototype biosensors. In this paper, we explore key ideas on how to leverage the design features of Bluetooth Low Energy to ease the integration of disparate biosensors at the sensor communication layer. This component is intended to fit into a larger, multi-layered, open data framework that can provide additional data management and analytics capabilities for consumers and scientists alike at all the layers of a data access model which is typically employed in a body sensor network system.",

    "abstract": "Population stratification is a well-documented confounder in GWASes, and is often addressed by including principal component (PC) covariates computed from common SNPs (SNP-PCs). In our analyses of summary statistics from 36 GWASes (mean n=88k), including 20 GWASes using 23andMe data that included SNP-PC covariates, we observed a significantly inflated LD score regression (LDSC) intercept for several traits--suggesting that residual stratification remains a concern, even when SNPPC covariates are included.\\n\\nHere we propose a new method, PC loading regression, to correct for stratification in summary statistics by leveraging SNP loadings for PCs computed in a large reference panel. In addition to SNP-PCs, the method can be applied to haploSNP-PCs, i.e. PCs computed from a larger number of rare haplotype variants that better capture subtle structure. Using simulations based on real genotypes from 54,000 individuals of diverse European ancestry from the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort, we show that PC loading regression effectively corrects for stratification along top PCs.\\n\\nWe applied PC loading regression to several traits with inflated LDSC intercepts. Correcting for the top four SNP-PCs in GERA data, we observe a significant reduction in LDSC intercept height summary statistics from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) consortium, but not for 23andMe summary statistics, which already included SNP-PC covariates. However, when correcting for additional haploSNP-PCs in 23andMe GWASes, inflation in the LDSC intercept was eliminated for eye color, hair color, and skin color and substantially reduced for height (1.41 to 1.16; n=430k). Correcting for haploSNP-PCs in GIANT height summary statistics eliminated inflation in the LDSC intercept (from 1.35 to 1.00; n=250k), eliminating 27 significant association signals including one at the LCT locus, which is highly differentiated among European populations and widely known to produce spurious signals. Overall, our results suggest that uncorrected population stratification is a concern in GWASes of large sample size and that PC loading regression can correct for this stratification.",

    "abstract": "Reliable exon recognition is key to the splicing of pre-mRNAs into mature mRNAs. TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein whose nuclear loss and cytoplasmic aggregation are a hallmark pathology in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD). TDP-43 depletion causes the aberrant inclusion of cryptic exons into a range of transcripts, but their extent, relevance to disease pathogenesis and whether they are caused by other RNA-binding proteins implicated in ALS/FTD are unknown. We developed an analysis pipeline to discover and quantify cryptic exon inclusion and applied it to publicly available human and murine RNA-sequencing data. We detected widespread cryptic splicing in TDP-43 depletion datasets but almost none in another ALS/FTD-linked protein FUS. Sequence motif and iCLIP analysis of cryptic exons demonstrated that they are bound by TDP-43. Unlike the cryptic exons seen in hnRNP C depletion, those linked to TDP-43 do not originate from a particular family of transposable element. Cryptic exons are poorly conserved and inclusion overwhelmingly leads to nonsense-mediated decay of the host transcript, with reduced transcript levels observed in differential expression analysis. RNA-protein interaction data on 73 different RNA-binding proteins showed that, in addition to TDP-43, 7 specifically bind TDP-43 linked cryptic exons.This suggests that TDP-43 competes with other splicing factors for binding to cryptic exons and can repress cryptic exon inclusion. Our quantitative analysis pipeline confirms the presence of cryptic exons during TDP-43 depletion and will aid investigation of their relevance to disease.",

These have been suggested to be strongly associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we utilise super-resolution STED microscopy combined with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (STED-FCS) to access the sub-diffraction diffusion regime of different fluorescent lipid analogues and GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) in the cellular plasma membrane, and compare it to the diffusion regime of these molecules in cell-derived actin-free giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs). We show that phospholipids and sphingomyelin, which undergo hindered diffusion in the live cell membrane, diffuse freely in the GPMVs. In contrast to sphingomyelin, which is transiently trapped on molecular-scale complexes in intact cells, diffusion of the ganglioside lipid GM1 suggests transient incorporation into nanodomains, which is less influenced by the actin cortex. Finally, our data on GPI-APs indicate two molecular pools in living cells, one pool showing high mobility with trapped and compartmentalized diffusion, and the other forming immobile clusters both of which disappear in GPMVs. Our data underlines the crucial role of the actin cortex in maintaining hindered diffusion modes of most but not all membrane molecules.",

    "abstract": "Background: Spiny mice of the genus Acomys are small desert-dwelling rodents that display physiological characteristics not typically found in rodents. Recent investigations have reported a menstrual cycle and scar free-wound healing in this species; characteristics that are exceedingly rare in mammals, and of considerable interest to the scientific community. These unique physiological traits, and the potential for spiny mice to accurately model human diseases, are driving increased use of this genus in biomedical research. However, little genetic information is currently available for Acomys, limiting the application of some modern investigative techniques. This project aimed to generate a reference transcriptome assembly for the common spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus).\\n\\nResults: Illumina RNA sequencing of male and female spiny mice produced 451 million, 150bp paired-end reads from 15 organ types. An extensive survey of de novo transcriptome assembly approaches of high-quality reads using Trinity, SOAPdenovo-Trans, and Velvet/Oases at multiple kmer lengths was conducted with 49 single-kmer assemblies generated from this dataset, with and without in silico normalization and probabilistic error correction. Merging transcripts from 49 individual single-kmer assemblies into a single meta-assembly of non-redundant transcripts using the EvidentialGene  tr2aacds pipeline produced the highest quality transcriptome assembly, comprised of 880,080 contigs, of which 189,925 transcripts were annotated using the SwissProt/Uniprot database.\\n\\nConclusions: This study provides the first detailed characterization of the spiny mouse transcriptome. It validates the application of the EvidentialGene  tr2aacds pipeline to generate a high-quality reference transcriptome assembly in a mammalian species, and provides a valuable scientific resource for further investigation into the unique physiological characteristics inherent in the genus Acomys.",

Furthermore, intertrial phase coherence of frontal theta oscillations was modulated by error magnitude, possibly indexing the degree of surprise. Finally, we found that delta phase at stimulus onset was correlated with future behavioral adjustments. Together, our findings suggest that low frequency oscillations play a key role in monitoring and in updating temporal predictions.",

    "abstract": "Studies attempting to functionally interpret complex-disease susceptibility loci by GWAS and eQTL integration have predominantly employed microarrays to quantify gene-expression. RNA-Seq has the potential to discover a more comprehensive set of eQTLs and illuminate the underlying molecular consequence. We examine the functional outcome of 39 variants associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) through integration of GWAS and eQTL data from the TwinsUK microarray and RNA-Seq cohort in lymphoblastoid cell lines. We use conditional analysis and a Bayesian colocalisation method to provide evidence of a shared causal-variant, then compare the ability of each quantification type to detect disease relevant eQTLs and eGenes. We discovered a greater frequency of candidate-causal eQTLs using RNA-Seq, and identified novel SLE susceptibility genes that were concealed using microarrays (e.g. NADSYN1, SKP1, and TCF7). Many of these eQTLs were found to influence the expression of several genes, suggesting risk haplotypes may harbour multiple functional effects. We pinpointed eQTLs modulating expression of four non-coding RNAs; three of which were replicated in whole-blood. Novel SLE associated splicing events were identified in the T-reg restricted transcription factor, IKZF2, the autophagy-related gene WDFY4, and the redox coenzyme NADSYN1, through asQTL mapping using the Geuvadis cohort. We have significantly increased our understanding of the genetic control of gene-expression in SLE by maximising the leverage of RNA-Seq and performing integrative GWAS-eQTL analysis against gene, exon, and splice-junction quantifications. In doing so, we have identified novel SLE candidate genes and specific molecular mechanisms that will serve as the basis for targeted follow-up studies.",

    "abstract": "RNA molecules play vital biological roles, and understanding their structures gives us crucial insights into their biological functions. Model evaluation is a necessary step for better prediction and design of 3D RNA structures. Knowledge-based statistical potential has been proved to be a powerful approach for evaluating models of protein tertiary structures. In present, several knowledge-based potentials have also been proposed to assess models of RNA 3D structures. However, further amelioration is required to rank near-native structures and pick out the native structure from near-native structures, which is crucial in the prediction of RNA tertiary structures. In this work, we built a novel RNA knowledge-based potential-- PTRNAmark, which not only combines nucleotides mutual and self energies but also fully considers the specificity of every RNA. The benchmarks on different testing data sets all show that PTRNAmark are more efficient than existing evaluation methods in recognizing native state from a pool of near-native states of RNAs as well as in ranking near-native states of RNA models.",

In this investigation, total 116 bZIP members were identified in apple genome and mapped on all 17 chromosomes with various densities as M.bZIPs. All these members were divided into six groups according to the phylogenetic relationship combining with bZIPs from rice and Arabidopsis. Investigating gene structure of M.bZIPs, five splicing patterns of intron were found in the DNA-binging region with no splicing position and splicing positions at different nucleotide of codons or different positions. Analyzing of protein structure of M.bZIPs, twenty-five motifs were identified with certain characteristic in different phylogenetic groups. To predict dimerization of leucine zipper region, the key positions of amino acid in heptad(s) were investigated. The results showed that most M.bZIPs may form hetero-dimer or homo-dimer and some M.bZIPs may form both. Expression experiment revealed that M.bZIP genes have organ-specific expression and widely expressed in flowers, leaves, and fruits. To investigate the response of M.bZIPs to abiotic stresses, the promoter sequences of randomly selected M.bZIP genes were analyzed. Cis-acting elements related to multiple stresses were found existing widely in promoter sequences. Quantitative real-time PCR results further demonstrated that the expression of some M.bZIP genes were quite sensitive to exogenous abscisic acid and osmotic treatments.",

The genes that vary in order to regulate the ability to colonize a niche are often difficult to identify, especially in the context of complex ecological systems and in experimentally uncontrolled natural environments. Quantitative genetic approaches provide an opportunity to investigate correlations between genetic factors and environmental parameters that might define a niche. Previously, we have shown how a collection of 208 whole-genome sequenced wild Caenorhabditis elegans can facilitate association mapping approaches. To correlate climate parameters with the variation found in this collection of wild strains, we used geographic data to exhaustively curate daily weather measurements in short-term (three month), middle-term (one year), and long-term (three year) durations surrounding the data of strain isolation. These climate parameters were then used as quantitative traits in the mapping approaches. We identified 10 QTL underlying variation in three traits: elevation, relative humidity, and average temperature. We then performed statistical analyses to further narrow the genomic interval of interest to identify gene candidates with variants potentially underlying phenotypic differences. Additionally, we performed two-strain competition assays at high and low temperatures to validate a QTL for temperature preference and found suggestive evidence that genotypes might be adapted to particular temperatures.\\n\\n100-word summary for G3Quantitative genetic approaches provide an opportunity to investigate correlations between genetic factors and environmental parameters that might define a niche, but these genes are difficult to identify, especially in the context of complex ecological systems.

    "abstract": "Abundance and space use are key population-level parameters used to inform management and conservation decisions of rare and elusive species, for which monitoring resources can be limited, potentially affecting quality of model-based inference. Recently-developed methods that integrate multiple data sources arising from the same ecological process have typically been focused on data from well-defined sampling protocols, i.e. structured data sets. Despite a rapid increase in availability of large datasets, the value of unstructured or opportunistic data to improve inference about spatial ecological processes is, however, unclear. Using spatial capture-recapture (SCR) methods, we jointly analyze opportunistic recovery of biological samples, traditional SCR data resulting from systematic sampling of hair traps and rub trees, and satellite telemetry data, collected on a reintroduced brown bear population in the central Alps. We compared the precision of sex-specific estimates of density and space use derived from models using combinations of data sources ranging from traditional SCR to a fully integrated SCR model that includes both telemetry and opportunistic data. Estimates of density and space use were more precise when unstructured data were added compared to estimates from a classical SCR model. Our results demonstrate that citizen science data lend itself naturally to integration with in the SCR framework and highlight the value of opportunistic data for improving inference about space use, and in turn, of abundance and density. When individual identity and location can be obtained from opportunistic observations, such data are informative about space use and thus have the potential to improve estimates of movement and density using SCR methods. This is particularly relevant in studies of rare or elusive species, where the amount of SCR encounters is usually small, but also budget restrictions and the difficulty of collaring animals limit the number of individuals for which telemetry information is available. Spatially-referenced opportunistic data thus potentially increase both the geographic extent of a study and the number of individuals with available spatial information, providing an improved understanding of how individuals are distributed and how they use space - fundamental components for calibrating conservation management actions.",

    "abstract": "Natural visual behaviour entails explorative eye movements, saccades, that bring different parts of a visual scene into the central vision. The neural processes guiding the selection of saccade targets are still largely unknown. Therefore, in this study, we tracked with magnetoencephalography (MEG) cortical dynamics of viewers who were freely exploring novel natural scenes. Overall, the viewers were largely consistent in their gaze behaviour, especially if the scene contained any persons. We took a fresh approach to relate the eye-gaze data to the MEG signals by characterizing dynamic cortical representations by means of representational distance matrices. Specifically, we compared the representational distances between the stimuli in the evoked MEG responses with predictions based (1) on the low-level visual similarity of the stimuli (as visually more similar stimuli evoke more similar responses in early visual areas) and (2) on the eye-gaze data. At 50-75 ms after the scene onset, the similarity of the occipital MEG patterns correlated with the low-level visual similarity of the scenes, and already at 75-100 ms the visual features attracting the first saccades predicted the similarity of the right parieto-occipital MEG responses. Thereafter, at 100-125 ms, the landing positions of the upcoming saccades explained MEG responses. These results indicate that MEG signals contain signatures of the rapid processing of natural visual scenes as well as of the initiation of the first saccades, with the processing of the saccade target preceding the processing of the landing position of the upcoming saccade.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHumans naturally make eye movements to bring different parts of a visual scene to the fovea where our visual acuity is the best. Tracking of eye gaze can reveal how we make inferences about the content of a scene by looking at different objects, or which visual cues automatically attract our attention and gaze. The brain dynamics governing natural gaze behaviour is still largely unknown. Here we suggest a novel approach to relate eye-tracking results with brain activity, as measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG), and demonstrate signatures of natural gaze behaviour in the MEG data already before the eye movements occur.",

Generating such palaeogenomic data requires specialised methodologies, and a variety of procedures for all stages of sample preparation have been proposed. However, the specific effects and biases introduced by alternative laboratory procedures is insufficiently understood. Here, we investigate the effects of three DNA isolation and two library preparation protocols on palaeogenomic data obtained from four Pleistocene subfossil bones. We find that alternative methodologies can significantly and substantially affect total DNA yield, the mean length and length distribution of recovered fragments, nucleotide composition, and the total amount of usable data generated. Furthermore, we also detect significant interaction effects between these stages of sample preparation on many of these factors. Effects and biases introduced in the laboratory can be sufficient to confound estimates of DNA degradation, sample authenticity and genomic GC content, and likely also estimates of genetic diversity and population structure. Future palaeogenomic studies need to carefully consider the effects of laboratory procedures during both experimental design and data analysis, particularly when studies involve multiple datasets generated using a mixture of methodologies.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (R-fMRI) holds the promise to reveal functional biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, extracting such biomarkers is challenging for complex multi-faceted neuropathologies, such as autism spectrum disorders. Large multi-site datasets increase sample sizes to compensate for this complexity, at the cost of uncontrolled heterogeneity. This heterogeneity raises new challenges, akin to those face in realistic diagnostic applications. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of inter-site classification of neuropsychiatric status, with an application to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database, a large (N=871) multi-site autism dataset. For this purpose, we investigate pipelines that extract the most predictive biomarkers from the data. These R-fMRI pipelines build participant-specific connectomes from functionally-defined brain areas. Connectomes are then compared across participants to learn patterns of connectivity that differentiate typical controls from individuals with autism. We predict this neuropsychiatric status for participants from the same acquisition sites or different, unseen, ones. Good choices of methods for the various steps of the pipeline lead to 67% prediction accuracy on the full ABIDE data, which is significantly better than previously reported results. We perform extensive validation on multiple subsets of the data defined by different inclusion criteria. These enables detailed analysis of the factors contributing to successful connectome-based prediction. First, prediction accuracy improves as we include more subjects, up to the maximum amount of subjects available. Second, the definition of functional brain areas is of paramount importance for biomarker discovery: brain areas extracted from large R-fMRI datasets outperform reference atlases in the classification tasks.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance remains an elusive problem in cancer therapy, particularly with novel targeted therapy approaches. Much work is currently focused upon the development of an increasing arsenal of targeted therapies, towards oncogenic driver genes such as ALK-EML4, to overcome the inevitable resistance that develops as therapies are continued over time. The current clinical paradigm after failure of first line ALK TKI is to administer another drug in the same class. As to which drug however, the answer is uncertain, as clinical evidence is lacking. To address this shortcoming, we evolved resistance in an ALK rearranged non-small cell lung cancer line (H3122) to a panel of 4 ALK tyrosine kinase in-hibitors used in clinic, and performed a collateral sensitivity analysis to each of the other drugs. We found that all of the ALK inhibitor resistant cell lines displayed a significant cross-resistance to all other ALK inhibitors. To test for the stability of the resistance phenotypes, we evaluated the ALK-inhibitor sensitivities after drug holidays of varying length (1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days). We found the resistance patterns to be stochastic and dynamic, with few conserved patterns. This unpredictability led us to an expanded search for treatment options for resistant cells. In this expansion, we tested a panel of 6 more anti-cancer agents for collateral sensitivity among the resistant cells, uncovering a multitude of possibilities for further treatment, including cross-sensitivity to several standard cytotoxic therapies as well as the HSP-90 inhibitors. Taken together, these results imply that resistance to targeted therapy in non-small cell lung cancer is truly a moving target; but also one where there are many opportunities to re-establish sensitivities where there was once resistance.",

    "abstract": "Using force as a probe to map the folding landscapes of RNA molecules has become a reality thanks to major advances in single molecule pulling experiments. Although the unfolding pathways under tension are complicated to predict studies in the context of proteins have shown that topology plays is the major determinant of the unfolding landscapes. By building on this finding we study the responses of RNA molecules to force by adapting Gaussian network model (GNM) that represents RNAs using a bead-spring network with isotropic interactions. Cross-correlation matrices of residue fluctuations, which are analytically calculated using GNM even upon application of mechanical force, show distinct allosteric communication as RNAs rupture. The model is used to calculate the force-extension curves at full thermodynamic equilibrium, and the corresponding unfolding pathways of four RNA molecules subject to a quasi-statically increased force. Our study finds that the analysis using GNM captures qualitatively the unfolding pathway of T. ribozyme elucidated by the optical tweezers measurement. However, the simple model is not sufficient to capture subtle features, such as bifurcation in the unfolding pathways or the ion effects, in the forced-unfolding of RNAs.",

    "abstract": "We analyse the role played by two different approaches of spatial heterogeneity in theoretical models of annual plants dynamics. The first approach is called quasi-continuous gradient in which one type of resource is changing gradually along the gradient line. In the second one, called the patches approach, part of the habitat is covered by patches and the resource has a different value in each patch. We show that when the spatial heterogeneity of the habitat is small, the two approaches yield the same average number of surviving species, even if a small number of patches is used. In a strong heterogeneity it takes many patches to get similar results as in the gradient case. The difference between the gradient and patchy description of the spatial heterogeneity increases with the number of species present in the system. We have also shown that even when the average number of surviving species is the same, the abundances of species are ordered in a different way, like different species are the dominant ones. The conclusion of this paper is that modelling spatial heterogeneity in a system of plants is not a simple task. Special care is needed when the heterogeneity of the habitat is large, since then depending of the choice of a method, some predictions may differ significantly, making the model non-robust. Therefore the type of theoretical approach must closely match the modelled ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "We propose and discuss a simulation model of annual plants competing for a single resource. Plants are characterised by their tolerance to a shortage of it and the maximum number of seeds a plant could produce in a year. Interaction among plants is reduced to blocking a part of the resource by the plants nearest neighbours. Spatial and temporal external conditions remain unchanged. We consider two systems - plants of one type (target plants) and a mixture of two types, when the second type differs from the target ones only by the tolerance to a shortage or surplus of the resource. We show how the life cycle of a plant depends on its tolerance, supply of the resource and how it is affected by the presence of the second type of annuals. We demonstrate that coexistence of the two species is possible, and we determine the conditions for it.",

Here we acquired resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data during wakefulness and graded levels of consciousness in rats. Data were analyzed using a dynamic approach combining the sliding-window method and k-means clustering. Our results demonstrate that whole-brain networks contain several quasi-stable patterns that dynamically recurred from the awake state into anesthetized states. Remarkably, two brain connectivity states with distinct spatial similarity to the structure of anatomical connectivity were strongly biased toward high and low consciousness levels, respectively. These results provide compelling neuroimaging evidence linking the dynamics of whole-brain functional connectivity patterns and states of consciousness at the behavioral level.\\n\\nConflict of interestnone.",

We obtained transcriptome-wide response profiles in four human primary cardiomyocyte cell lines that were treated with 22 different KIs using mRNA sequencing with 3 digital gene expression. The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System was used to derive relative risk scores for four types of CT for different KIs. We used elastic net regression to associate these transcriptomic profiles with KI-associated risk scores for CT subtypes to obtain clinically-weighted transcriptomic signatures, which showed good predictive properties (cross-validation R2 >0.87). Our clinically-weighted transcriptomic signatures for KI-associated CT may be of relevance in early drug development for the prediction of KI-associated CT.",

    "abstract": "The sequence of Zika virus has evolved as it has spread out of Africa and into the Americas. It is unclear whether American strains of the virus define a new serotype. Here, we have tested the virulence and immunogenicity of three wild-type ZIKV strains in neonatal Swiss Webster mice. We found that all three ZIKV strains (African MR766, 1947; Asian FSS13025, 2010; and American, PRVABC59, 2015) are capable of killing neonatal mice after intracranial injection. Intraperitoneal injection with these viruses did not kill, but produced neutralizing antibodies as measured by a PRNT50 assay. Sera from mice infected with each virus were tested for neutralizing activity against the infecting virus and also the other two viruses by a PRNT50 assay. In general, the antibodies induced by each virus were good at neutralizing that virus (the homologous virus), but somewhat poorer at neutralizing the other two viruses (heterologous viruses). Antibodies induced by the African strain MR766 were about 4-fold worse at neutralizing the American strain PRVABC59 than the homologous strain, while antibodies induced by the American strain were about 10-fold worse at neutralizing the African strain than the homologous strain. Because the antibodies are cross-neutralizing at some level, the viruses do not form separate serotypes. Nevertheless, these results raise concern that the immunity conferred by the African virus may protect only relatively poorly against the new American strains. This has implications for the possible spread of the American ZIKV strains to Africa and Southeast Asia, and also for the development of vaccines.",

    "abstract": "The polarized partitioning of proteins in cells underlies asymmetric cell division, which is an important driver of development and cellular diversity. Like most cells, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae divides asymmetrically to give two distinct daughter cells. This asymmetry mimics that seen in metazoans and the key regulatory proteins are conserved from yeast to human. A well-known example of an asymmetric protein is the transcription factor Ace2, which localizes specifically to the daughter nucleus, where it drives a daughter-specific transcriptional network. We performed a reverse genetic screen to look for regulators of asymmetry based on the Ace2 localization phenotype. We screened a collection of essential genes in order to analyze the effect of core cellular processes in asymmetric cell division. This identified a large number of mutations that are known to affect progression through the cell cycle, suggesting that cell cycle delay is sufficient to disrupt Ace2 asymmetry. To test this model we blocked cells from progressing through mitosis and found that prolonged cell cycle arrest is sufficient to disrupt Ace2 asymmetry after release. We also demonstrate that members of the evolutionary conserved FACT chromatin-remodeling complex are required for both asymmetric and cell cycle-regulated localization of Ace2.",

    "abstract": "X chromosome inactivation (XCI) silences the transcription from one of the two X chromosomes in mammalian female cells to balance expression dosage between XX females and XY males. XCI is, however, characteristically incomplete in humans: up to one third of X-chromosomal genes are expressed from both the active and inactive X chromosomes (Xa and Xi, respectively) in female cells, with the degree of \\\"escape\\\" from inactivation varying between genes and individuals1,2 (Fig. 1). However, the extent to which XCI is shared between cells and tissues remains poorly characterized3,4, as does the degree to which incomplete XCI manifests as detectable sex differences in gene expression5 and phenotypic traits6. Here we report a systematic survey of XCI using a combination of over 5,500 transcriptomes from 449 individuals spanning 29 tissues, and 940 single-cell transcriptomes, integrated with genomic sequence data (Fig. 1). By combining information across these data types we show that XCI at the 683 X-chromosomal genes assessed is generally uniform across human tissues, but identify examples of heterogeneity between tissues, individuals and cells. We show that incomplete XCI affects at least 23% of X-chromosomal genes, identify seven new escape genes supported by multiple lines of evidence, and demonstrate that escape from XCI results in sex biases in gene expression, thus establishing incomplete XCI as a likely mechanism introducing phenotypic diversity6,7. Overall, this updated catalogue of XCI across human tissues informs our understanding of the extent and impact of the incompleteness in the maintenance of XCI.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=114 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/073957_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (33K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c902f7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e1b14dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f56feorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@687c65_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO Schematic overview of the study.

    "abstract": "The Flavivirus genus encompasses several arboviruses of public health significance such as dengue, yellow fever, and Zika viruses. It also includes insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) that are only capable of infecting insect hosts. The vast majority of mosquito-infecting flaviviruses have been associated with mosquito species of the Aedes and Culex genera in the Culicinae subfamily, which also includes most arbovirus vectors. Mosquitoes of the Anophelinae subfamily are not considered significant arbovirus vectors, however flaviviruses have occasionally been detected in field-caught Anopheles specimens. Whether such observations reflect occasional spillover or laboratory contamination or whether Anopheles mosquitoes are natural hosts of flaviviruses is unknown. Here, we provide in silico and in vivo evidence of transcriptionally active, flavivirus-derived endogenous viral elements (EVEs) in the genome of Anopheles minimus and Anopheles sinensis. Such non-retroviral endogenization of RNA viruses is consistent with a shared evolutionary history between flaviviruses and Anopheles mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analyses of the two newly described EVEs support the existence of a distinct clade of Anopheles-associated ISFs.",
