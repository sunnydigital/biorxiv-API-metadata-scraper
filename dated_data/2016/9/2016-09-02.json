    "abstract": "Using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), the full transcriptome of individual cells can be acquired, enabling a quantitative cell-type characterisation based on expression profiles. However, due to the large variability in gene expression, identifying cell types based on the transcriptome remains challenging. We present Single-Cell Consensus Clustering (SC3), a tool for unsupervised clustering of scRNA-seq data. SC3 achieves high accuracy and robustness by consistently integrating different clustering solutions through a consensus approach. Tests on twelve published datasets show that SC3 outperforms five existing methods while remaining scalable, as shown by the analysis of a large dataset containing 44,808 cells. Moreover, an interactive graphical implementation makes SC3 accessible to a wide audience of users, and SC3 aids biological interpretation by identifying marker genes, differentially expressed genes and outlier cells. We illustrate the capabilities of SC3 by characterising newly obtained transcriptomes from subclones of neoplastic cells collected from patients.",

    "abstract": "Microbes limit risk by stochastic bet hedging - low frequency expression of less fit, slow growing cells constitutively preadapted against many stresses including antibiotics. By contrast, here we report continuous variation in the induced frequency of cells with slow osmotic stress signaling, survival and proliferation among 50 ecologically-distinct strains of budding yeast challenged by sudden hyperosmotic stress. Despite extensive variation in early mortality, strains displayed robust perfect adaptation and recovery of steady-state viability in moderate stress. In severe stress survival depended on strain-specific proportions of cells with divergent strategies.  Cautious cells survived without dividing;  reckless cells attempted to divide too soon and failed, killing both mother and daughter. We show that heritable frequencies of cautious and reckless cells produce a rapidly diversifying template for microbial bet hedging that mimics natural variation in stress responses whose timing, amplitude and frequency could evolve - be  tuned by - different patterns of environmental stress.",

Using fluorescent protein reporters we find that under non-inducing conditions the MAL32 promoter exhibits a low basal level of expression, similar to the GAL1 promoter, and that both promoters can be induced independently of each other using the respective sugars, maltose and galactose. While their repression upon glucose addition is immediate and complete, we found that the MAL32 and GAL1 promoter each exhibit distinct induction kinetics. A set of plasmids is available to facilitate the application of the MAL32 promoter for chromosomal modifications using PCR targeting and for plasmid based gene expression.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe conquest of the land from aquatic habitats is a fascinating evolutionary event that happened multiple times in different phyla. Mollusks are among the organisms that successfully invaded the non-marine realm, resulting in the radiation of terrestrial panpulmonate gastropods. We compared transcriptomes from panpulmonates to study the selective pressures that modeled the transitions from marine into freshwater and terrestrial realms in this molluscan lineage.\\n\\nResultsDe novo assembly of six panpulmonate transcriptomes resulted in 55,000 - 97,000 predicted open reading frames, of which 9 - 14% were functionally annotated. Adding published transcriptomes, we predicted 791 ortholog clusters shared among fifteen panpulmonate species, resulting in 702 amino acid and 736 codon-wise alignments. The branch-site test of positive selection applied to the codon-wise alignments showed twenty-eight genes under positive selection in the freshwater lineages and seven in the terrestrial lineages. Gene ontology categories of these candidate genes include actin assembly, transport of glucose, and the tyrosine metabolism in the terrestrial lineages; and, DNA repair, metabolism of xenobiotics, mitochondrial electron transport, and ribosome biogenesis in the freshwater lineages.\\n\\nConclusionsWe identified candidate genes representing processes that may have played a key role during the water-to-land transition in Panpulmonata. These genes were involved in energy metabolism and gas-exchange surface development in the terrestrial lineages and in the response to the abiotic stress factors (UV radiation, osmotic pressure, xenobiotics) in the freshwater lineages. Our study expands the knowledge of possible adaptive signatures in genes and metabolic pathways related to the invasion of non-marine habitats in invertebrates.",

    "abstract": "The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized neuronal compartment that plays a key role in neuronal development and excitability. It concentrates multiple ion channels and cell adhesion molecules. The anchoring of these AIS membrane components is known to be highly dependent of the scaffold protein ankyrin G (ankG) but whether ankG membrane partners play a reciprocal role in ankG targeting and stabilization has not been studied yet. In cultured hippocampal neurons and cortical organotypic slices, we found that shRNA-mediated knockdown of ankG membrane partners led to a decrease of ankG concentration and perturbed the AIS formation and maintenance. These perturbations were rescued by expressing an AIS-targeted sodium channel, or a minimal construct containing the ankyrin-binding domain of Nav1.2 and a membrane anchor. We thus demonstrate that a tight and precocious association of ankG to its membrane partners is crucial for the establishment and maintenance of the AIS.",

    "abstract": "The expression of sexually dimorphic phenotypes from a shared genome between males and females is a longstanding puzzle in evolutionary biology. Increasingly, research has made use of transcriptomic technology to examine the molecular basis of sexual dimorphism through gene expression studies, but even this level of detail misses the metabolic processes that ultimately link gene expression with the whole organism phenotype. We use metabolic profiling in Drosophila melanogaster to complete this missing step, with a view to examining variation in male and female metabolic profiles, or metabolomes, throughout development. We show that the metabolome varies considerably throughout larval, pupal and adult stages. We also find significant sexual dimorphism in the metabolome, although only in pupae and adults, and the extent of dimorphism tends to increase throughout development. We compare this to transcriptomic data from the same population and find that the general pattern of increasing sex differences throughout development is mirrored in RNA expression. We discuss our results in terms of the usefulness of metabolic profiling in linking genotype and phenotype to more fully understand the basis of sexually dimorphic phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Visual neuroscience has traditionally focused much of its attention on understanding the response properties of neurons along the visual pathways. This review focuses instead on the properties of the white matter connections between these neurons. Specifically, we provide an introduction to methods to study the human visual white matter using diffusion MRI (dMRI). This method allows us to measure the white matter connections in individual visual systems in vivo, allows us to trace long-range connections between different parts of the visual system, and to measure the biophysical properties of these connections. We explain the principles underlying dMRI measurements and the basics of modeling these data. We review a range of findings from recent studies on connections between different visual field maps, on the effects of visual impairment on the white matter, and on the properties underlying networks that process visual information that supports visual face recognition. Finally, we discuss a few promising directions for future studies. These include new methods for analysis of MRI data, open data-sets that are becoming available to study brain connectivity and white matter properties, and open-source software for the analysis of these data.",

The Shank3/F and Shank3/J models mimick gene mutations associated with Phelan-Mcdermid syndrome and the Cacna1c model recapitulates the deletion underlying Timothy syndrome. The current study utilizes both standard and novel, computer-vision based behavioral tests, the same methdology used in our previously published companion report on the Cntnap2 null and 16p11.2 deletion models. Overall, some but not all behaviors replicated published findings. Those that replicated, such as social behavior and overgrooming in Shank3 models, also tended to be milder than previous reports. The Shank3/F model, and to a much lesser extent, the Shank3/J and Cacna1c models, showed hypoactivity and a general anxiety-like behavior triggered by external stimuli which pervaded social interactions. We did not detect deficits in a cognitive procedural learning test nor did we observe perseverative behavior in these models. We did, however, find differences in exploratory patterns of Cacna1c mutant mice suggestive of a behavioral effect in a social setting. In addition, Shank3/F but not Shank3/J KO or Cacna1c HET showed differences in sensory-gating. Discrepancies in our current results from previous reports may be dependent on subtle differences in testing conditions, housing enrichment, or background strain. Both positive and negative results from this study will be useful in identifying the most robust and replicable behavioral signatures within and across mouse models of autism. Understanding these phenotypes may shed light of which features to study when screening compounds for potential therapeutic interventions.",

The Aedes aegypti mosquito is considered to be the main vector to humans worldwide, but there is evidence of other mosquito species, including Culex quinquefasciatus, playing a role in the Brazilian outbreak. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally compared the vectorial competence of laboratory-reared A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus. We found ZIKV in the midgut, salivary glands, and saliva of artificially fed C. quinquefasciatus. Additionally, we collected ZIKV-infected C. quinquefasciatus from urban areas of high microcephaly incidence in Recife, Brazil.

Thousands of CpG sites whose tissue-specific methylation levels are strongly correlated with chronological age have been previously identified. However, the majority of these studies have focused primarily on cosmopolitan populations living in the developed world; it is not known if age-related patterns of DNA methylation at these loci are similar across a broad range of human genetic and ecological diversity. We investigated genome-wide methylation patterns using saliva and whole blood derived DNA from two traditionally hunting and gathering African populations: the Baka of the western Central African rainforest and the =Khomani San of the South African Kalahari Desert. We identify hundreds of CpG sites whose methylation levels are significantly associated with age, thousands that are significant in a meta-analysis, and replicate trends previously reported in populations of non-African descent. We confirm that an age-associated site in the gene ELOVL2 shows a remarkably congruent relationship with aging in humans, despite extensive genetic and environmental variation across populations. We also demonstrate that genotype state at methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) can affect methylation trends at some known age-associated CpG sites. Our study explores the relationship between CpG methylation and chronological age in populations of African hunter-gatherers, who rely on different diets across diverse ecologies. While many age-related CpG sites replicate across populations, we show that considering common genetic variation at meQTLs further improves our ability to detect previously identified age associations.",

Rarity is recognised as a necessary, although not sufficient, criterion for pathogenicity, but frequency cutoffs used in Mendelian analysis are often arbitrary and overly lenient. Recent very large reference datasets, such as the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), provide an unprecedented opportunity to obtain robust frequency estimates even for very rare variants. Here we present a statistical framework for the frequency-based filtering of candidate disease-causing variants, accounting for disease prevalence, genetic and allelic heterogeneity, inheritance mode, penetrance, and sampling variance in reference datasets. Using the example of cardiomyopathy, we show that our approach reduces by two-thirds the number of candidate variants under consideration in the average exome, and identifies 43 variants previously reported as pathogenic that can now be reclassified. We present precomputed allele frequency cutoffs for all variants in the ExAC dataset.",

    "abstract": "Experience with visual stimuli can improve their perceptual performance, a phenomenon termed visual perceptual learning (VPL), but how does VPL shape our conscious experience of learned stimuli? VPL has been found to improve measures of metacognition, suggesting increased conscious stimulus accessibility. Such studies however, have largely failed to control objective task accuracy, which typically correlates with metacognition. Here, using a staircase method to control this confound, we investigated whether VPL improves the metacognitive accuracy of perceptual judgements. Across three consecutive days, subjects learned to discriminate faces based on either their identity or contrast. Holding objective accuracy constant, perceptual thresholds improved in both tasks, while metacognitive accuracy diverged, with face contrast VPL improving metacognition, and face identity VPL failing to. Our findings can be interpreted in a reverse hierarchy theory-like model of VPL, which counterintuitively predicts that the VPL of low- but not high-level stimulus properties should improve conscious stimulus accessibility.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe World Health Organization stated in March 2016 that there was scientific consensus that the mosquito-borne Zika virus was a cause of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome and of microcephaly and other congenital brain abnormalities, based on rapid evidence assessments. Decisions about causality require systematic assessment to guide public health actions. The objectives of this study were: to update and re-assess the evidence for causality through a rapid and systematic review about links between Zika virus infection and a) congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the foetuses and offspring of pregnant women and b) Guillain-Barre syndrome in any population; and to describe the process and outcomes of an expert assessment of the evidence about causality.\\n\\nMethods and findingsThe study had three linked components. First, in February 2016, we developed a causality framework that defined questions about the relationship between Zika virus infection and each of the two clinical outcomes in 10 dimensions; temporality, biological plausibility, strength of association, alternative explanations, cessation, dose-response, animal experiments, analogy, specificity and consistency. Second, we did a systematic review (protocol number CRD42016036693). We searched multiple online sources up to May 30, 2016 to find studies that directly addressed either outcome and any causality dimension, used methods to expedite study selection, data extraction and quality assessment, and summarised evidence descriptively. Third, a multidisciplinary panel of experts assessed the review findings and reached consensus on causality. We found 1091 unique items up to May 30, 2016. For congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, we included 72 items; for eight of 10 causality dimensions (all except dose-response relationship and specificity) we found that more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association with Zika virus infection. For Guillain-Barre syndrome, we included 36 items, of which more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association in seven of ten dimensions (all except dose-response relationship, specificity and animal experimental evidence). Articles identified non-systematically from May 30-July 29, 2016 strengthened the review findings. The expert panel concluded that: a) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and clusters of microcephaly is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including 61 microcephaly; and b) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barre syndrome is that Zika virus infection is a trigger of Guillain-Barre syndrome. The expert panel recognised that Zika virus alone may not be sufficient to cause either congenital brain abnormalities or Guillain-Barre syndrome but agreed that the evidence was sufficient to recommend increased public health measures. Weaknesses are the limited assessment of the role of dengue virus and other possible co-factors, the small number of comparative epidemiological studies, and the difficulty in keeping the review up to date with the pace of publication of new research.\\n\\nConclusionsRapid and systematic reviews with frequent updating and open dissemination are now needed, both for appraisal of the evidence about Zika virus infection and for the next public health threats that will emerge. This rapid systematic review found sufficient evidence to say that Zika virus is a cause of congenital abnormalities and is a trigger of Guillain-Barre situation.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a feasibility of using a data-reductive strategy for analyzing big MS data. The proposed method utilizes our reduction algorithm MS-REDUCE and peptide deduction is accomplished using Tide with hiXcorr. Using this approach we were able to process 1 million spectra in under 3 hours. Our results showed that running peptide deduction with smaller amount of selected peaks made the computations much faster and scalable with increasing resolution of MS data. Quality assessment experiments performed on experimentally generated datasets showed good quality peptide matches can be made using the reduced datasets. We anticipate that the proteomics and systems biology community will widely adopt our reductive strategy due to its efficacy and reduced time for analysis.",
