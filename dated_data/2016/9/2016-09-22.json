    "abstract": "The thalamus is globally connected with distributed cortical regions, yet the functional significance of this extensive thalamocortical connectivity remains largely unknown. By performing graph-theoretic analyses on thalamocortical functional connectivity data collected from human participants, we found that the human thalamus displays network properties capable of integrating multimodal information across diverse cortical functional networks. From a meta-analysis of a large dataset of functional brain imaging experiments, we further found that the thalamus is involved in multiple cognitive functions. Finally, we found that focal thalamic lesions in humans have widespread distal effects, disrupting the modular organization of cortical functional networks. This converging evidence suggests that the human thalamus is a critical hub region that could integrate heteromodal information and maintain the modular structure of cortical functional networks.",

    "abstract": "It is widely known that the sensitivity analysis plays a major role in computing the strength of the influence of involved factors in any phenomena under investigation. When applied to expression profiles of various intra/extracellular factors that form an integral part of a signaling pathway, the variance and density based analysis yields a range of sensitivity indices for individual as well as various combinations of factors. These combinations denote the higher order interactions among the involved factors. Computation of higher order interactions is often time consuming but they give a chance to explore the various combinations that might be of interest in the working mechanism of the pathway. For example, in a range of fourth order combinations among the various factors of the Wnt pathway, it would be easy to assess the influence of the destruction complex formed by APC, AXIN, CSKI and GSK3 interaction. But the effect of these combinations vary over time as measurements of fold changes and deviations in fold changes vary. In this work, after estimating the individual effects of factors for a higher order combination, the individual indices are considered as discriminative features. A combination, then is a multivariate feature set in higher order (>2). With an excessively large number of factors involved in the pathway, it is difficult to search for important combinations in a wide search space over different orders. Exploiting the analogy with the issues of prioritizing webpages using ranking algorithms, for a particular order, a full set of combinations of interactions can then be prioritized based on these features using a powerful ranking algorithm via support vectors. Recording the changing rankings of the combinations over time reveals of how higher order interactions behave within the pathway and when an intervention might be necessary to influence the interaction within the pathway. This could lead to development of time based therapeutic interventions.Code has been made available on Google drive at https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7Kkv8wlhPU-V1Fkd1dMSTd5ak0&usp=sharing",

    "abstract": "Recent successes in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) make it possible to address important questions about the genetic architecture of complex traits, such as allele frequency and effect size. One lesser-known aspect of complex traits is the extent of allelic heterogeneity (AH) arising from multiple causal variants at a locus. We developed a computational method to infer the probability of AH and applied it to three GWAS and four expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets. We identified a total of 4152 loci with strong evidence of AH. The proportion of all loci with identified AH is 4-23% in eQTLs, 35% in GWAS of High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL), and 23% in schizophrenia. For eQTLs, we observed a strong correlation between sample size and the proportion of loci with AH (R2=0.85, P = 2.2e-16), indicating that statistical power prevents identification of AH in other loci. Understanding the extent of AH may guide the development of new methods for fine mapping and association mapping of complex traits.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms behind Alzheimers disease (AD) is one of the most challenging problems in neuroscience. Recent efforts provided valuable insights on the genetic, biochemical and neuronal correlates of AD. The advances in structural and functional neuroimaging provided massive evidence for the AD related alterations in brain connectivity. In this study, we investigated the whole-brain resting state functional connectivity (FC) and variability in dynamic functional connectivity (v-FC) of the subjects with preclinical condition (PC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimers disease (AD). The synchronization in the whole-brain was monotonously decreasing during the course of the progression. However, only in the AD group the reduced synchronization produced significant widespread effects in FC. Furthermore, we found elevated variability of FC in PC group, which was reversed in AD group. We proposed a whole-brain computational modeling approach to study the mechanisms behind these alterations. We estimated the effective connectivity (EC) between brain regions in the model to reproduce observed FC of each subject. First, we compared ECs between groups to identify the changes in underlying connectivity structure. We found that the significant EC changes were restricted to temporal lobe. Then, based on healthy control subjects we systematically manipulated the dynamics in the model to investigate its effect on FC. The model showed FC alterations similar to those observed in clinical groups providing a mechanistic explanation to AD progression.",

How to account for this variation in an analysis of the interplay between sequence variation and DNA methylation is not well understood, especially when the number of CpG differences between samples is large. Here we use whole-genome bisulfite sequencint data on two highly divergent inbred mouse strains to study this problem. We find that while the large number of strain-specific CpGs necessitates considerations regarding the reference genomes used during alignment, properties such as CpG density are surprisingly conserved across the genome. We introduce a method for including strain-specific CpGs in differential analysis, and show that accounting for strain-specific CpGs increases the power to find differentially methylated regions between the strains. Our method uses smoothing to impute methylation levels at strain-specific sites, thereby allowing strain-specific CpGs to contribute to the analysis, and also allowing us to account for differences in the spatial occurrences of CpGs. Our results have implications for analysis of genetic variation and DNA methylation using bisulfite-converted DNA.",

Statistical analysis and the validity of conclusions drawn from (time series) 16S rRNA and other metagenomic sequencing data is hampered by the presence of significant amount of noise and missing data (sampling zeros). Accounting uncertainty in microbiome data is often challenging due to the difficulty of obtaining biological replicates. Additionally, the compositional nature of current amplicon and metagenomic data differs from many other biological data types adding another challenge to the data analysis.\\n\\nTo address these challenges in human microbiome research, we introduce a novel probabilistic approach to explicitly model overdispersion and sampling zeros by considering the temporal correlation between nearby time points using Gaussian Processes. The proposed Temporal Gaussian Process Model for Compositional Data Analysis (TGP-CODA) shows superior modeling performance compared to commonly used Dirichlet-multinomial, multinomial, and non-parametric regression models on real and synthetic data. We demonstrate that the nonreplicative nature of human gut microbiota studies can be partially overcome by our method with proper experimental design of dense temporal sampling. We also show that different modeling ap-proaches have a strong impact on ecological interpretation of the data, such as stationarity, persistence, and environmental noise models.\\n\\nA Stan implementation of the proposed method is available under MIT license at https://github.com/tare/GPMicrobiome.",

    "abstract": "Age-related diseases are often attributed to immunopathology, which results in self-damage caused by an inappropriate inflammatory response. Immunopathology associated with early-life inflammation also appears to cause faster ageing, although we lack direct experimental evidence for this association. To understand the interactions between ageing, inflammation and immunopathology, we used the mealworm beetle Tenebrio molitor as a study organism. We hypothesized that phenoloxidase (PO), an important immune effector in insect defence, may impose substantial immunopathological costs by causing tissue damage, in turn accelerating aging. In support of this hypothesis, we found that RNAi knockdown of PO transcripts in young adults reduced inflammation-induced autoreactive tissue damage to Malpighian tubules, and increased adult lifespan. Our work thus provides empirical evidence for a causative link between immunopathological costs of early life inflammation and faster ageing. We also reasoned that if natural selection weakens with age, older individuals should display increased immunopathological costs associated with an immune response. Indeed, we found that while old infected individuals cleared infection faster than young individuals, they displayed exacerbated immunopathological costs and higher post-infection mortality. RNAi-mediated knockdown of PO response reduced immunopathology in older beetles and increased their lifespan after infection. This is the first demonstration of a direct role of immunopathological consequences of immune response during ageing in insects. Our work is also the first report that highlights the pervasive role of immunopathology under diverse contexts of aging and immune response.",

    "abstract": "Recently it has become feasible to detect long blocks of almost identical sequence shared between pairs of genomes. These so called IBD-blocks are direct traces of recent coalescence events, and as such contain ample signal for inferring recent demography. Here, we examine sharing of such blocks in two-dimensional populations with local migration. Using a diffusion approximation to trace genetic ancestry back in time, we derive analytical formulas for patterns of isolation by distance of long IBD-blocks, which can also incorporate recent population density changes. As a main result, we introduce an inference scheme that uses a composite likelihood approach to fit observed block sharing to these formulas. We assess our inference method on simulated block sharing data under several standard population genetics models. We first validate the diffusion approximation by showing that the theoretical results closely match simulated block sharing patterns. We then show that our inference scheme rather accurately and robustly recovers estimates of the dispersal rate and effective density, as well as bounds on recent dynamics of population density. To demonstrate an application, we use our estimation scheme to explore the fit of a diffusion model to Eastern European samples in the POPRES data set. We show that ancestry diffusing with a rate of [Formula] during the last centuries, combined with accelerating population growth, can explain the observed exponential decay of block sharing with pairwise sample distance.",

    "abstract": "Periodic bottlenecks play a major role in shaping the adaptive dynamics of natural and laboratory populations of asexual microbes. Here we study how they affect the  Extent of Adaptation (EoA), in such populations. EoA, the average fitness gain relative to the ancestor, is the quantity of interest in a large number of microbial experimental-evolution studies which assume that for any given bottleneck size (N0) and number of generations between bottlenecks (g), the harmonic mean size (HM=N0g) will predict the ensuing evolutionary dynamics. However, there are no theoretical or empirical validations for HM being a good predictor of EoA. Using experimental-evolution with Escherichia coli and individual-based simulations, we show that HM fails to predict EoA (i.e., higher N0g does not lead to higher EoA). This is because although higher g allows populations to arrive at superior benefits by entailing increased variation, it also reduces the efficacy of selection, which lowers EoA. We show that EoA can be maximized in evolution experiments by either maximizing N0 and/or minimizing g. We also conjecture that N0/g is a better predictor of EoA than N0g. Our results call for a re-evaluation of the role of population size in predicting fitness trajectories. They also aid in predicting adaptation in asexual populations, which has important evolutionary, epidemiological and economic implications.",

The antimicrobial drug metronidazole is used for treatment, but has lead to widespread drug resistance. We undertook sequencing of multiple clinical isolates and lab derived lines to identify genetic markers and mechanisms of metronidazole resistance.\\n\\nResultsReduced representation genome sequencings of more than 100 T. vaginalis clinical isolates identified 3,923 SNP markers and presence of a bipartite population structure. Linkage disequilibrium decays rapidly, suggesting genome-wide recombination and the feasibility of genetic association studies in the parasite. We identified 72 SNPs associated with metronidazole resistance, and a comparison of SNPs within several lab-derived resistant lines revealed an overlap with the clinically resistant isolates. We identified SNPs in sets of genes for which no function has yet been assigned, as well as in functionally-characterized genes highly relevant to drug resistance (e.g., pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFO)). Transcription profiling of these and other genes served as proxy for testing the functional consequences of multiple identified SNPs. Transcription profiles of lab-derived drug resistance strain as well as clinically resistant strain depict common regulation changes in carbohydrate metabolism and oxygen detoxification pathways correlated with Mz resistance. Finally, we identified convergent genetic changes in lab-derived resistant lines of Tritrichomonas foetus, a distantly-related species that causes venereal disease in cattle.\\n\\nConclusionsOur observation of shared genetic changes within and between T. vaginalis and Tr. foetus parasites suggests conservation of the pathways through which adaptation has occurred.

    "abstract": "Protein kinases are critical drug targets for treating a large variety of human diseases. Type-I and type-II kinase inhibitors frequently exhibit off-target toxicity or lead to mutation acquired resistance. Two highly specific allosteric type-III MEK-targeted drugs, Trametinib and Cobimetinib, offer a new approach. Thus, understanding the binding mechanism of existing type-III kinase inhibitors will provide insights for designing new type-III kinase inhibitors. In this work we have systematically studied the binding mode of MEK-targeted type-III inhibitors using structural systems pharmacology and molecular dynamics simulation. Our studies provide detailed sequence, structure, interaction-fingerprint, pharmacophore and binding-site information on the binding characteristics of MEK type-III kinase inhibitors. We propose that the helix-folding activation loop is a hallmark allosteric binding site for type-III inhibitors. Subsequently we screened and predicted allosteric binding sites across the human kinome, suggesting other kinases as potential targets suitable for type-III inhibitors. Our findings will provide new insights into the design of potent and selective kinases inhibitors.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHuman protein kinases represent a large protein family relevant to many diseases, especially cancers, and have become important drug targets. However, developing the desired selective kinase-targeted inhibitors remain challenging. Kinase allosteric inhibitors provide that opportunity, but, to date, few have been designed other than MEK inhibitors. To more efficiently develop kinase allosteric inhibitors, we systematically studied the binding mode of the MEK type-III allosteric kinase inhibitors using structural system pharmacology and molecular dynamics approaches. New insights into the binding mode and mechanism of type-III inhibitors were revealed that may facilitate the design of new prospective type-III kinase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Structural rearrangements have long been recognized as an important source of genetic variation with implications in phenotypic diversity and disease, yet their evolutionary dynamics are difficult to characterize with short-read sequencing. Here, we report long-read sequencing for 12 strains representing major subpopulations of the partially domesticated yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its wild relative Saccharomyces paradoxus. Complete genome assemblies and annotations generate population-level reference genomes and allow for the first explicit definition of chromosome partitioning into cores, subtelomeres and chromosome-ends. High-resolution view of structural dynamics uncovers that, in chromosomal cores, S. paradoxus exhibits higher accumulation rate of balanced structural rearrangements (inversions, translocations and transpositions) whereas S. cerevisiae accumulates unbalanced rearrangements (large insertions, deletions and duplications) more rapidly. In subtelomeres, recurrent interchromosomal reshuffling was found in both species, with higher rate in S. cerevisiae. Such striking contrasts between wild and domesticated yeasts reveal the influence of human activities on structural genome evolution.",

    "abstract": "We developed a dynamic forecasting model for Zika virus (ZIKV), based on real-time online search data from Google Trends (GTs). It was designed to provide Zika virus disease (ZVD) surveillance for Health Departments with early warning, and predictions of numbers of infection cases, which would allow them sufficient time to implement interventions. We used correlation data from ZIKV epidemics and Zika-related online search in GTs between 12 February and 25 August 2016 to construct an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model (0, 1, 3) for the dynamic estimation of ZIKV outbreaks. The online search data acted as an external regressor in the forecasting model, and was used with the historical ZVD epidemic data to improve the quality of the predictions of disease outbreaks. Our results showed a strong correlation between Zika-related GTs and the cumulative numbers of reported cases, both confirmed and suspected (both p<0.001; Pearson Product-Moment Correlation analysis). The predictive cumulative numbers of confirmed and suspected cases increased steadily to reach 148,510 (95% CI: 126,826-170,195) and 602,721 (95% CI: 582,753-622,689), respectively, in 21 October 2016. Integer-valued autoregression provides a useful base predictive model for ZVD cases. This is enhanced by the incorporation of GTs data, confirming the prognostic utility of search query based surveillance. This accessible and flexible dynamic forecast model could be used in the monitoring of ZVD to provide advanced warning of future ZIKV outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Orthology assignment is ideally suited for functional inference. However, because predicting orthology is computationally intensive at large scale, and most pipelines relatively in accessible, less precise homology-based functional transfer is still the default for (meta-)genome annotation. We therefore developed eggNOG-mapper, a tool for functional annotation of large sets of sequences based on fast orthology assignments using precomputed clusters and phylogenies from eggNOG. To validate our method, we benchmarked Gene Ontology predictions against two widely used homology-based approaches: BLAST and InterProScan. Compared to BLAST, eggNOG-mapper reduced by 7% the rate of false positive assignments, and increased by 19% the ratio of curated terms recovered over all terms assigned per protein. Compared to InterProScan, eggNOG-mapper achieved similar proteome coverage and precision, while predicting on average 32 more terms per protein and increasing by 26% the rate of curated terms recovered over total term assignments per protein. Through strict orthology assignments, eggNOG-mapper further renders more specific annotations than possible from domain similarity only (e.g. predicting gene family names). eggNOG-mapper runs ~15x than BLAST and at least 2.5x faster than InterProScan. The tool is available standalone or as an online service at http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de.",

    "abstract": "The search for molecular targets of selection is leading to a better understanding of how evolution shapes biological diversity. Instances of recent and rapid speciation are suitable for associating phenotypes with their causal genotypes, because gene flow may homogenize areas of the genome that are not under divergent selection. Locating differentiated genomic regions among taxa allows us to test associations between the genes in these regions and their contributions to phenotypic diversity. Here we study a rapid radiation of nine sympatric bird species known as southern capuchino seedeaters, which are strikingly differentiated in sexually selected characters of male plumage and song. We sequenced the genomes of 72 individuals representing a diverse set of species and associated phenotypes to search for differentiated genomic regions. We asked what genes are harbored in divergent regions and to what extent has selection on the same targets shaped phenotypic diversity across different lineages. Capuchinos show differences in a small proportion of their genomes, yet selection has acted independently on the same targets during the groups radiation. Many divergence peaks contain genes involved in the melanogenesis pathway, with the strongest signal originating from a regulatory region upstream of the gene coding for the Agouti-signaling protein. Across all divergence peaks, the most differentiated areas are similarly likely regulatory. Our findings are consistent with selection acting on the same genomic regions in different lineages to shape the evolution of cis-regulatory elements, which control how more conserved genes are expressed and thereby generate diversity in sexually selected traits.",

    "abstract": "Experimental huts are part of the WHO process for testing and evaluation of Insecticide Treated Nets (ITN) in semi-field conditions. Experimental Hut Trials (EHTs) mostly focus on two main indicators (i.e. mortality and blood feeding reduction) that serve as efficacy criteria to obtain WHO interim recommendation. However, several other outputs that rely on counts of vectors collected in the huts are neglected although they can give useful information about vectors behavior and personal protection provided by ITNs. In particular, EHTs allow to measure the deterrent effect and personal protection of ITNs.\\n\\nTo provide a better assessment of ITNs efficacy, we performed a retrospective analysis of the deterrence and the personal protection against malaria transmission for 12 unwashed and 13 washed ITNs evaluated through EHTs conducted in West Africa.\\n\\nA significant deterrent effect was shown for six of the 12 unwashed ITNs tested. When washed 20 times, only three ITNs had significant deterrent effect (Rate Ratios (RR)<1; p<0.05) and three showed an apparent \\\"attractiveness\\\" (RR>1; p<0.01). When compared to the untreated net, all unwashed ITNs showed lower number of blood-fed Anopheles indicating a significant personal protection (RR<1, p<0.05). However, when washed 20 times, three ITNs that were found to be attractive did not significantly reduced human-vector contact (p>0.05).\\n\\nCurrent WHO efficacy criteria do not sufficiently take into account the deterrence effect of ITNs. Moreover the deterrence variability is rarely discussed in EHT's reports. Our findings highlighted the long range effect (deterrent or attractive) of ITNs that may have significant consequences for personal/community protection against malaria transmission. Indicators measuring the deterrence should be further considered for the evaluation of ITNs.",
