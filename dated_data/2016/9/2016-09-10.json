    "abstract": "The structure of environmentally induced phenotypic covariation can influence the effective strength and magnitude of natural selection. Yet our understanding of the factors that contribute to and influence the evolutionary lability of such covariation is poor. Most studies have either examined environmental variation without accounting for covariation, or examined phenotypic and genetic covariation without distinguishing the environmental component. In this study we examined the effect of mutational perturbations on different properties of environmental covariation, as well as mean shape. We use strains of Drosophila melanogaster bearing well-characterized mutations known to influence wing shape, as well as naturally-derived strains, all reared under carefully-controlled conditions and with the same genetic background. We find that mean shape changes more freely than the covariance structure, and that different properties of the covariance matrix change independently from each other. The perturbations affect matrix orientation more than they affect matrix eccentricity or total variance. Yet, mutational effects on matrix orientation do not cluster according to the developmental pathway that they target. These results suggest that it might be useful to consider a more general concept of  decanalization, involving all aspects of variation and covariation.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic microtubules (MTs) undergo growth, shrinkage, and pausing. However, how MT polymerisation cycles are produced and spatiotemporally regulated at a molecular level is unclear, as the entire cycle has not been recapitulated in vitro with defined components. In this study, we reconstituted dynamic MT plus end behaviour involving all three phases, by mixing tubulin with five Drosophila proteins, EB1, XMAP215Msps, Sentin, kinesin-13Klp10A, and CLASPMast/Orbit. When singly mixed with tubulin, CLASPMast/Orbit strongly inhibited MT catastrophe and reduced the growth rate. However, in the presence of the other four factors, CLASPMast/Orbit acted as an inducer of pausing. The mitotic kinase Plk1Polo modulated the activity of CLASPMast/Orbit and kinesin-13Klp10A, and increased the dynamic instability of MTs, reminiscent of mitotic cells. These results suggest that five conserved proteins constitute the core factors for creating dynamic MTs in cells, and that Plk1-dependent phosphorylation is a crucial event for switching from the interphase to mitotic mode.",

    "abstract": "Psychophysical tasks for non-human primates have been instrumental in studying circuits underlying perceptual decision-making. To obtain greater experimental flexibility, these tasks have subsequently been adapted for use in freely moving rodents. However, advances in functional imaging and genetic targeting of neuronal populations have made it critical to develop similar tasks for head-fixed mice. Although head-fixed mice have been trained in two-alternative forced choice tasks before, these tasks were not self-initiated, making it difficult to attribute error trials to perceptual or decision errors as opposed to mere lapses in task engagement. Here, we describe a paradigm for head-fixed mice with three lick spouts, analogous to the well-established 3-port paradigm for freely moving rodents. Mice readily learned to initiate trials on the center spout and performed around 200 self-initiated trials per session, reaching good psychometric performance within two weeks of training. We expect this paradigm will be useful to study the role of defined neural populations in sensory processing and decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Recently developed methods that utilize partitioning of long genomic DNA fragments, and barcoding of shorter fragments derived from them, have succeeded in retaining long-range information in short sequencing reads. These so-called read cloud approaches represent a powerful, accurate, and cost-effective alternative to single-molecule long-read sequencing. We developed software, GROC-SVs, that takes advantage of read clouds for structural variant detection and assembly. We apply the method to two 10x Genomics data sets, one chromothriptic sarcoma with several spatially separated samples, and one breast cancer cell line, all Illumina-sequenced to high coverage. Comparison to short-fragment data from the same samples, and validation by mate-pair data from a subset of the sarcoma samples, demonstrate substantial improvement in specificity of breakpoint detection compared to short-fragment sequencing, at comparable sensitivity, and vice versa. The embedded longrange information also facilitates sequence assembly of a large fraction of the breakpoints; importantly, consecutive breakpoints that are closer than the average length of the input DNA molecules can be assembled together and their order and arrangement reconstructed, with some events exhibiting remarkable complexity. These features facilitated an analysis of the structural evolution of the sarcoma. In the chromothripsis, rearrangements occurred before copy number amplifications, and using the phylogenetic tree built from point mutation data we show that single nucleotide variants and structural variants are not correlated. We predict significant future advances in structural variant science using 10x data analyzed with GROC-SVs and other read cloud-specific methods.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is increasingly used for the unbiased detection of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and eukaryotic parasites in clinical samples. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of clinical bacterial isolates has been shown to inform hospital infection prevention practices, but the use of this technology during potential respiratory virus outbreaks has not been taken advantage of. Here, we report on the use of mNGS to inform the real-time infection prevention response to a cluster of hospital-acquired human parainfluenza 3 virus (HPIV3) infections at a childrens hospital. Isolates from 3 patients with hospital-acquired HPIV3 identified over a 12-day period on a general medical unit and 10 temporally-associated isolates from patients with community-acquired of HPIV3 were analyzed. Our sample-to-sequencer time was <24 hours while our sample-to-answer turn-around time was <60 hours with a hands-on time of approximately 6 hours. Eight (2 case isolates and 6 control isolates) of 13 samples had sufficient sequencing coverage to yield whole genomes for HPIV3, while 10 (2 cases and 8 controls) of 13 samples gave partial genomes and all 13 samples had >1 read to HPIV3. Phylogenetic clustering revealed the presence of identical HPIV3 genomic sequence in the two of the cases with hospital-acquired infection, consistent with the concern for recent transmission within the medical unit. Adequate sequence coverage was not recovered for the third case. This work demonstrates the promise of mNGS to provide actionable information for infection control in addition to microbial detection.",

    "abstract": "Population viability analysis (PVA) is used to assess the probability that a biological population will persist for a specified period of time. Such models are typically cast as Markov processes that may include age, stage, sex and metapopulation structures, density-dependence and ecological interaction processes. They may also include harvesting, stocking, and thresholds that trigger interventions. Here we present Numerus PVA, which is a web app that includes extensible user-selected options. Specifically, Numerus PVA allows for the specification of one to ten age classes, one or two sexes, single population or metapopulation configurations with 2 or 3 subpopulations, as well as density-dependent settings for inducing region-specific carrying capacities. Movement among subpopulations can be influenced by age, metapopulation connectivity, and attractivity of regions based on the relative fitness of the youngest age classes in each region. Simulations can be carried out deterministically or stochastically, with a user-specified combination of demographic and environmental processes. Numerus PVA is freely available at http://www.numerusinc.com/webapps/pva for running directly on any browser and device. Numerus PVA is easily modified by users familiar with the NovaModeler Software Platform.",

    "abstract": "A Monte Carlo type model describing dynamics of three pairs of annual plants living in a homogeneous habitat is presented and discussed. Each plant follows its own history with growing, fecundity and survival chances determined individually as functions of the plants condition and environment. The three plants - Valerianella locusta, Mysotis ramosissima and Cerastium semidecandrum differ by the weight of their seeds, which in the model determines the competition preference. Heavier seeds have a better chance for germination from a site containing seeds of different plants. Better colonisers produce more seeds and disperse them over a larger distance. I show that without absolute asymmetry in the impact effects between better competitors and better colonisers and in a spatially and temporarily homogeneous habitat, coexistence of species is possible, however only in a limited time. This is different from statements coming from models using mean-field type methods. I demonstrate also that in a system of two species clustering of plants of the same type are more frequent. From the calculated survival chances of seedlings and adult plants it follows that elimination of plants occur mostly at the early stages of the plants life cycle, which agrees with the field data.I show that this competition/colonisation trade-off model is sufficient to maintain coexistence and I determine the conditions for dominance of one type of plants. I show that the time of extinction of the weaker species goes down with increasing observation time as a power function with the exponent independent of the type of plants.",

    "abstract": "Negative feedbacks and incoherent feedforward loops are known to give rise to a pulse in response to a step change in the input. In this article, I present a study of composite motifs made of coupled feedback and feedforward loops, acting via different regulatory mechanisms. In these motifs, the effect of input and output on the controller is realized via either an AND-gate or an OR-gate. Using a simplistic model of gene expression and a common parameter set, I have studied the effect of global parameter variation on the dynamic and steady-state properties of different motifs, in response to a step change in the input. These metrics include steady state gain, response time, overshoot, peak time and peak duration. For the motifs with a negative feedback component, it can be seen that AND-gated motifs show a \\\"feedforward-like\\\" property whereas the OR-gated motifs show a \\\"feedback-like\\\" property. Motifs with a positive feedback component show hypersensitivity of gain, to parameters. Overshoot correlates negatively with peak time whereas peak duration correlates concavely with peak time, a property that is also observed for uncoupled feedback and feedforward motifs. This indicates that this relationship between overshoot, peak duration and peak time, seems to be a universal property of pulse-generating motifs.",

    "abstract": "Over the last few decades, ecologists have come to appreciate that key ecological patterns, which describe ecological communities at relatively large spatial scales, are not only scale dependent, but also intimately intertwined. The relative abundance of species - which informs us about the commonness and rarity of species - changes its shape from small to large spatial scales. The average number of species as a function of area has a steep initial increase, followed by decreasing slopes at large scales. Finally, if we find a species in a given location, it is more likely we find an individual of the same species close-by, rather than farther apart. Such spatial turnover depends on the geographical distribution of species, which often are spatially aggregated. This reverberates on the abundances as well as the richness of species within a region, but so far it has been difficult to quantify such relationships.\\n\\nWithin a neutral framework - which considers all individuals competitively equivalent - we introduce a spatial stochastic model, which phenomenologically accounts for birth, death, immigration and local dispersal of individuals. We calculate the pair correlation function - which encapsulates spatial turnover - and the conditional probability to find a species with a certain population within a given circular area. Also, we calculate the macro-ecological patterns, which we have referred to above, and compare the analytical formulae with the numerical integration of the model. Finally, we contrast the model predictions with the empirical data for two lowland tropical forest inventories, showing always a good agreement.",
