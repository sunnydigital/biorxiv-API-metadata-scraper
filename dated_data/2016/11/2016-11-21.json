    "abstract": "Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation shape tissue-type-specific proteomes, but their relative contributions remain contested. Estimates of the factors determining protein levels in human tissues do not distinguish between (i) the factors determining the variability between the abundances of different proteins, i.e., mean-level-variability and, (ii) the factors determining the physiological variability of the same protein across different tissue types, i.e., across-tissues variability. We sought to estimate the contribution of transcript levels to these two orthogonal sources of variability, and found that scaled mRNA levels can account for most of the mean-level-variability but not necessarily for across-tissues variability. The reliable quantification of the latter estimate is limited by substantial measurement noise. However, protein-to-mRNA ratios exhibit substantial across-tissues variability that is functionally concerted and reproducible across different datasets, suggesting extensive post-transcriptional regulation. These results caution against estimating protein fold-changes from mRNA fold-changes between different cell-types, and highlight the contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to shaping tissue-type-specific proteomes.",

    "abstract": "Infection of more than one virus in a host, coinfection, is common across taxa and environments. Viral coinfection can enable genetic exchange, alter the dynamics of infections, and change the course of viral evolution. Yet, a systematic test of the factors explaining variation in viral coinfection across different taxa and environments awaits completion. Here I employ three microbial data sets of virus-host interactions covering cross-infectivity, culture coinfection, and single-cell coinfection (total: 6,564 microbial hosts, 13,103 viruses) to provide a broad, comprehensive picture of the ecological and biological factors shaping viral coinfection. I found evidence that ecology and virus-virus interactions are recurrent factors shaping coinfection patterns. Host ecology was a consistent and strong predictor of coinfection across all three datasets: cross-infectivity, culture coinfection, and single-cell coinfection. Host phylogeny or taxonomy was a less consistent predictor, being weak or absent in the cross-infectivity and single-cell coinfection models, yet it was the strongest predictor in the culture coinfection model. Virus-virus interactions strongly affected coinfection. In the largest test of superinfection exclusion to date, prophage sequences reduced culture coinfection by other prophages, with a weaker effect on extrachromosomal virus coinfection. At the single-cell level, prophage sequences eliminated coinfection. Virus-virus interactions also increased culture coinfection with ssDNA-dsDNA coinfections >2x more likely than ssDNA-only coinfections. The presence of CRISPR spacers was associated with a ~50% reduction in single-cell coinfection in a marine bacteria, despite the absence of exact spacer matches in any active infection. Collectively, these results suggest the environment bacteria inhabit and the interactions among surrounding viruses are two factors consistently shaping viral coinfection patterns. These findings highlight the role of virus-virus interactions in coinfection with implications for phage therapy, microbiome dynamics, and viral infection treatments.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive brain stimulation using focused ultrasound has many potential applications as a research and clinical tool. Here, we investigated the effect of focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with systemically administered microbubbles on visual-motor decision-making behavior in monkeys. We applied FUS to the putamen in one hemisphere to open the blood-brain barrier, and then tested behavioral performance 3-4 hours later. On days when the monkeys were treated with FUS, their decisions were faster and more accurate than days without sonication. The performance improvement suggested both a shift in the decision criterion and an enhancement of the use of sensory evidence in the decision process. FUS also interacted with the effect of a low dose of haloperidol. The results suggest that a two-minute application of FUS can have a sustained impact on performance of complex cognitive tasks, and may increase the efficacy of psychoactive medications. The results lend further support to the idea that the dorsal striatum plays an integral role in evidence- and reward-based decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Gene set enrichment approaches have been increasingly successful in finding signals of recent polygenic selection in the human genome. In this study, we aim at detecting biological pathways affected by positive selection in more ancient human evolutionary history. Focusing on four branches of the primate tree that lead to modern humans, we tested all available protein coding gene trees of the Primates clade for signals of adaptation in these branches, using the likelihood-based branch site test of positive selection. The results of these locus-specific tests were then used as input for a gene set enrichment test, where whole pathways are globally scored for a signal of positive selection, instead of focusing only on outlier \\\"significant\\\" genes. We identified signals of positive selection in several pathways that are mainly involved in immune response, sensory perception, metabolism, and energy production. These pathway-level results are highly significant, even though there is no functional enrichment when only focusing on top scoring genes. Interestingly, several gene sets are found significant at multiple levels in the phylogeny, but different genes are responsible for the selection signal in the different branches. This suggests that the same function has been optimized in different ways at different times in primate evolution.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum aids the learning and execution of fast coordinated movements, with acquired information being stored by plasticity of parallel fibre--Purkinje cell synapses. According to the current consensus, erroneously active parallel fibre synapses are depressed by complex spikes arising when climbing fibres signal movement errors. However, this theory cannot solve the credit assignment problem of using the limited information from a global movement evaluation to optimise behaviour by guiding the plasticity in numerous neurones. We identify the possible implementation of an algorithm solving this problem, whereby spontaneous complex spikes perturb ongoing movements, create an eligibility trace for plasticity and signal resulting error changes to guide plasticity. These error changes are extracted by adaptively cancelling the average error. This framework, stochastic gradient descent with estimated global errors, generates specific predictions for synaptic plasticity rules that contradict the current consensus. However, in vitro plasticity experiments under physiological conditions verified our predictions, highlighting the sensitivity of plasticity studies to unphysiological conditions. Using numerical and analytical approaches we demonstrate the convergence and estimate the capacity of learning in our implementation. Finally, a similar mechanism may operate during optimisation of action sequences by the basal ganglia, where dopamine could both initiate movements and signal rewards, analogously to the dual perturbation and correction role of the climbing fibre outlined here.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe management of insect pests has long been dominated by the use of chemical insecticides, with the aim of instantaneously killing enough individuals to limit their damage. To minimize unwanted consequences, environmentally-friendly approaches have been proposed that utilize biological control and take advantage of intrinsic demographic processes to reduce pest populations.\\nC_LIO_LIWe address the feasibility of a novel pest management strategy based on the release of insects infected with Wolbachia, which causes cytoplasmic incompatibilities in its host population, into a population with a pre-existing Allee effect. We hypothesize that the transient decline in population size caused by a successful invasion of Wolbachia can bring the population below its Allee threshold and, consequently, trigger extinction.\\nC_LIO_LIWe develop a stochastic population model that accounts for Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibilities in addition to an Allee effect arising from mating failures at low population densities. Using our model, we identify conditions under which cytoplasmic incompatibilities and Allee effects successfully interact to drive insect pest populations toward extinction. Based on our results, we delineate control strategies based on introductions of Wolbachia-infected insects.\\nC_LIO_LIWe extend this analysis to evaluate control strategies that implement successive introductions of two incompatible Wolbachia strains. Additionally, we consider methods that combine Wolbachia invasion with mating disruption tactics to enhance the pre-existing Allee effect.\\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate that Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility and the Allee effect act independently from one another: the Allee effect does not modify the Wolbachia-invasion threshold, and cytoplasmic incompatibilities only have a marginal effect on the Allee threshold. However, the interaction of these two processes can drive even large populations to extinction. The success of this method can be amplified by the introduction of multiple Wolbachia cytotypes as well as the addition of mating disruption.\\nC_LIO_LIOur study extends the existing literature by proposing the use of Wolbachia introductions to capitalize on pre-existing Allee effects and consequently eradicate insect pests. More generally, it highlights the importance of transient dynamics, and the relevance of manipulating a cascade of destabilizatons for pest management.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Addressing the transmission enigma of the neglected disease Buruli ulcer (BU) is a World Health Organization priority. In Australia, we have observed an association between mosquitoes harboring the causative agent, Mycobacterium ulcerans, and BU. Here we tested a contaminated skin model of BU transmission by dipping the tails from healthy mice in cultures of the causative agent, Mycobacterium ulcerans. Tails were exposed to mosquito (Aedes notoscriptus and Aedes aegypti) blood feeding or punctured with sterile needles. Two of 11 of mice with M. ulcerans contaminated tails exposed to feeding A. notoscriptus mosquitoes developed BU. Eighteen of 20 mice subjected to contaminated tail needle puncture developed BU. Mouse tails coated only in bacteria did not develop disease. We observed a low infectious dose-50 of four colony-forming units and a median incubation time of 12 weeks, consistent with data from human infections. We have uncovered a highly efficient and biologically plausible atypical transmission mode of BU via natural or anthropogenic skin punctures.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBuruli ulcer is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans. Unfortunately, how people contract this disease is not well understood. Here we show for the first time using experimental infections in mice that a very low dose of M. ulcerans delivered beneath the skin by a minor injury caused by a blood-feeding insect (mosquito) or a needle puncture is sufficient to cause Buruli ulcer.

In particular, both humans and Zebra finches had to categorize between Dutch vowels that differ on duration, frequency or both depending on the condition. Feedback was given for correct and incorrect responses. The results showed that humans and Zebra finches are probably using the same methods of learning depending on the categorization tasks that they are exposed to.

    "abstract": "Proper cell size is essential for cellular function (Hall et al., 2004). Nonetheless, despite more than 100 years of work on the subject, the mechanisms that maintain cell size homeostasis are largely mysterious (Marshall et al., 2012). Cells in growing populations maintain cell size within a narrow range by coordinating growth and division. Bacterial and eukaryotic cells both demonstrate homeostatic size control, which maintains population-level variation in cell size within a certain range, and returns the population average to that range if it is perturbed (Marshall et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2012; Amodeo and Skotheim, 2015). Recent work has proposed two different strategies for size control: budding yeast has been proposed to use an inhibitor-dilution strategy to regulate size at the G1/S transition (Schmoller et al., 2015), while bacteria appear to use an adder strategy, in which a fixed amount of growth each generation causes cell size to converge on a stable average, a mechanism also suggested for budding yeast (Campos et al., 2014; Jun and Taheri-Araghi, 2015; Taheri-Araghi et al., 2015; Tanouchi et al., 2015; Soifer et al., 2016). Here we present evidence that cell size in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is regulated by a third strategy: the size dependent expression of the mitotic activator Cdc25. The cdc25 transcript levels are regulated such that smaller cells express less Cdc25 and larger cells express more Cdc25, creating an increasing concentration of Cdc25 as cell grow and providing a mechanism for cell to trigger cell division when they reach a threshold concentration of Cdc25. Since regulation of mitotic entry by Cdc25 is well conserved, this mechanism may provide a wide spread solution to the problem of size control in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Anoxic subsurface sediments contain communities of heterotrophic microorganisms that metabolize organic carbon at extraordinarily slow rates. In order to assess the mechanisms by which subsurface microorganisms access detrital sedimentary organic matter, we measured kinetics of a range of extracellular peptidases in anoxic sediments of the White Oak River estuary, NC. Nine distinct peptidase substrates were enzymatically hydrolyzed at all depths. Potential peptidase activities (Vmax) decreased with increasing sediment depth, although Vmax expressed on a per cell basis was approximately the same at all depths. Half-saturation constants (Km) decreased with depth, indicating peptidases that functioned more efficiently at low substrate concentrations. Potential activities of extracellular peptidases acting on molecules that are enriched in degraded organic matter (D-phenylalanine and L-ornithine) increased relative to enzymes that act on L-phenylalanine, further suggesting microbial community adaptation to access degraded organic matter. Nineteen classes of predicted, exported peptidases were identified in genomic data from the same site, of which genes for class C25 (gingipain-like) peptidases represented more than 40% at each depth. Methionine aminopeptidases, zinc carboxypeptidases, and class S24-like peptidases, which are involved in single-stranded DNA repair, were also abundant. These results suggest a subsurface heterotrophic microbial community that primarily accesses low-quality detrital organic matter via a diverse suite of well-adapted extracellular enzymes.\\n\\nIO_SCPLOWMPORTANCEC_SCPLOWBurial of organic carbon in marine and estuarine sediments represents a long-term sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Globally, [~]40% of organic carbon burial occurs in anoxic estuaries and deltaic systems. However, the ultimate controls on the amount of organic matter that is buried in sediments, versus oxidized into CO2, are poorly constrained. Here we used a combination of enzyme assays and metagenomic analysis to identify how subsurface microbial communities catalyze the first step of proteinaceous organic carbon degradation. Our results show that microbial communities in deeper sediments are adapted to access molecules characteristic of degraded organic matter, suggesting that those heterotrophs are adapted to life in the subsurface.",

We present a refined resolution of global transcriptional alterations, including regulatory network interactions, coding and noncoding gene expression changes as well as alternative splicing events, many of which cannot be resolved by existing coarse developmental time-{-}-courses. We describe novel short lived and cycling patterns of gene expression and temporally dissect ordered gene expression at bidirectional promoters and responses to transcription factors.

As a demonstration, we apply MONSTER to four different studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to identify transcription factors that alter the network structure as the cell state progresses toward the disease-state. Our results demonstrate that MONSTER can find strong regulatory signals that persist across studies and tissues of the same disease and that are not detectable using conventional analysis methods based on differential expression.

This study aimed at localising homologous recombination repair (HR) genes and their chromosomal loci and correlating their nucleotide variants with susceptibility to breast cancer. In this study authors analysed the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in homologous recombination repair genes and the incidence of breast cancer in the population of Polish women.\\n\\nMethodsBlood samples from 94 breast cancer patients were analysed as test group. Individuals were recruited into the study at the Department of Oncological Surgery and Breast Diseases of the Institute of the Polish Mothers Memorial Hospital in Lodz, Poland.

    "abstract": "A synthetic approach to biology is a promising technique for various applications. Recent advancements have demonstrated the feasibility of constructing synthetic two-input logic gates in Escherichia coli cells with long-term memory based on DNA inversion induced by recombinases. On the other hand, recent evidences indicate that DNA inversion mediated by genome editing tools is possible; powerful genome editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9 systems, have great potential to be exploited to implement large-scale recombinase-based circuits. What remains unclear is how to construct arbitrary Boolean functions based on these emerging technologies. In this paper, we lay the theoretical foundation formalizing the connection between recombinase-based genetic circuits and Boolean functions. It enables systematic construction of any given Boolean function using recombinase-based logic gates. We further develop a methodology leveraging existing electronic design automation (EDA) tools to automate the synthesis of complex recombinase-based genetic circuits with respect to area and delay optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed method.",

To exploit the 2D nature of Hi-C contact maps, matrix techniques like spectral analysis are particularly useful. Here, we present HiC-spector, a collection of matrix-related functions for analyzing Hi-C contact maps. In particular, we introduce a novel reproducibility metric for quantifying the similarity between contact maps based on spectral decomposition. The metric successfully separates contact maps mapped from Hi-C data coming from biological replicates, pseudo-replicates and different cell types.\\n\\nAvailabilitySource code in Julia and the documentation of HiC-spector can be freely obtained at https://github.com/gersteinlab/HiC_spector\\n\\nContactpi@gersteinlab.org",

Gamete fate regulatory networks have been analyzed in nematodes, flies and mammals, but only in C. elegans have terminal intrinsic regulators been identified, which include a Tob/BTG protein family member, FOG-3. Canonical Tob/BTG proteins function as monomeric adaptor proteins that link RNA binding proteins to deadenylases. To ask if FOG-3 functions similarly, we first determined its crystal structure. FOG-3 harbors a classical Tob/BTG fold, but unlike other Tob/BTG proteins, FOG-3 dimerizes and these FOG-3 dimers assemble into polymers. The importance of FOG-3 polymers to sperm fate specification was confirmed in vivo using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to create mutations designed to disrupt the polymer interface. The FOG-3 surface potential is highly basic, suggesting binding to nucleic acid. We find that FOG-3 binds RNA directly with a strong preference for 3UTRs of oogenic mRNAs. Our results reveal a divergent but striking molecular assembly for proteins with a Tob/BTG fold, make key advances in understanding the mechanism of sperm fate specification and highlight the potential for undiscovered protein polymers in biology.",

    "abstract": "Although we perceive a richly detailed visual world, our ability to identify 1 individual objects is severely limited in clutter, particularly in peripheral vision. Models of such crowding have generally been driven by the phenomenological misidentifications of crowded targets: using stimuli that do not easily combine to form a unique symbol (e.g. letters or objects), observers typically confuse the source of objects and report either the target or a distractor, but when continuous features are used (e.g. orientated gratings or line positions) observers report a feature somewhere between the target and distractor. To reconcile these accounts, we develop a hybrid method of adjustment that allows detailed analysis of these multiple error categories. Observers reported the orientation of a target, under several distractor conditions, by adjusting an identical foveal target. We apply new modelling to quantify whether perceptual reports show evidence of positional uncertainty, source confusion, and featural averaging on a trial-by-trial basis. Our results show that observers make a large proportion of source-confusion errors. However, our study also reveals the distribution of perceptual reports that underlie performance in this crowding task more generally: aggregate errors cannot be neatly labelled because they are heterogeneous and their structure depends on target-distractor distance.",

Complete knowledge of all genetic variants, as provided by whole genome sequence (WGS), will help, but is currently financially prohibitive for well powered GWAS studies. To explore the advantages of WGS in a well powered setting, we performed eQTL mapping using WGS and RNA-seq, and showed that the lead eQTL variants called using WGS are more likely to be causal. We derived properties of the causal variant from simulation studies, and used these to propose a method for implicating likely causal SNPs. This method predicts that 25% - 70% of the causal variants lie in open chromatin regions, depending on tissue and experiment. Finally, we identify a set of high confidence causal variants and show that they are more enriched in GWAS associations than other eQTL. Of these, we find 65 associations with GWAS traits and show examples where the gene implicated by expression has been functionally validated as relevant for complex traits.",

However, no consensus exists regarding the ubiquity and abundance of these bacterioplankton, which is necessary to evaluate their ecological importance. The present study investigated the bacterioplankton community in the oxygenated hypolimnia of 10 deep freshwater lakes. Despite the broad geochemical characteristics of the lakes, 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that many predominant lineages in the hypolimnion were shared by several lakes and consisted of members occurring in the entire water layer and members specific to the hypolimnion. Catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) revealed that representative hypolimnion-specific lineages, CL500-11 (Chloroflexi), CL500-3, CL500-37, CL500-15 (Planctomycetes), and the MGI group (Thaumarchaeota), together accounted for 1.5-32.9% of all bacterioplankton in the hypolimnion of the lakes. Furthermore, an analysis of micro-diversification based on single-nucleotide variation in the partial 16S rRNA gene sequence (oligotyping) suggested the presence of hypolimnion-specific ecotypes among the lineages occurring in the entire water layer (e.g., acI and Limnohabitans). Collectively, these results demonstrate the uniqueness, ubiquity, and quantitative significance of bacterioplankton in the oxygenated hypolimnion, motivating future studies to focus on their eco-physiological characteristics.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of RNA-Seq data from individual differentiating cells enables us to reconstruct the differentiation process and the degree of differentiation (in pseudo-time) of each cell. Such analyses can reveal detailed expression dynamics and functional relationships for differentiation. To further elucidate differentiation processes, more insight into gene regulatory networks is required. The pseudo-time can be regarded as time information and, therefore, single-cell RNA-Seq data are time-course data with high time resolution. Although time-course data are useful for inferring networks, conventional inference algorithms for such data suffer from high time complexity when the number of samples and genes is large. Therefore, a novel algorithm is necessary to infer networks from single-cell RNA-Seq during differentiation.\\n\\nIn this study, we developed the novel and efficient algorithm SCODE to infer regulatory networks, based on ordinary differential equations. We applied SCODE to three single-cell RNA-Seq datasets and confirmed that SCODE can reconstruct observed expression dynamics. We evaluated SCODE by comparing its inferred networks with use of a DNaseI-footprint based network. The performance of SCODE was best for two of the datasets and nearly best for the remaining dataset. We also compared the runtimes and showed that the runtimes for SCODE are significantly shorter than for alternatives. Thus, our algorithm provides a promising approach for further single-cell differentiation analyses.\\n\\nThe R source code of SCODE is available at https://github.com/hmatsu1226/SCODE.",

However, the folding times of these proteins derived from the simulations were more than 4-10 times longer than their experimental values. This article reports autonomous folding of CLN025 and Trp-cage in isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics simulations with agreements within factors of 0.69-1.75 between simulated and experimental folding times at different temperatures. These results show that CLN025 and Trp-cage can now autonomously fold in silico as fast as in experiments, and suggest that the accuracy of folding simulations for fast-folding proteins begins to overlap with the accuracy of folding experiments. This opens new prospects of developing computer algorithms that can predict both ensembles of conformations and their interconversion rates for a protein from its sequence for artificial intelligence on how and when a protein acts as a receiver, switch, and relay to facilitate various subcellular-to-tissue communications. Then the genetic information that encodes proteins can be better read in the context of intricate biological functions.",

    "abstract": "The quantitative relationship between the magnitude of variation in minor histocompatibility antigens (mHA) and graft versus host disease (GVHD) pathophysiology in stem cell transplant (SCT) donor-recipient pairs (DRP) is not established. In order to elucidate this relationship, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 27 HLA matched related (MRD), & 50 unrelated donors (URD), to identify nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). An average 2,463 SNPs were identified in MRD, and 4,287 in URD DRP (p<0.01); resulting peptide antigens that may be presented on HLA class I molecules in each DRP were derived in silico (NetMHCpan ver2.0) and the tissue expression of proteins these were derived from determined (GTex). MRD DRP had an average 3,670 HLA-binding-alloreactive peptides, putative mHA (pmHA) with an IC50 of <500 nM, and URD, had 5,386 (p<0.01). To simulate an alloreactive donor cytotoxic T cell response, the array of pmHA in each patient was considered as an operator matrix modifying a hypothetical cytotoxic T cell clonal vector matrix; each responding T cell clones proliferation was determined by the logistic equation of growth, accounting for HLA binding affinity and tissue expression of each alloreactive peptide. The resulting simulated organ-specific alloreactive T cell clonal growth revealed marked variability, with the T cell count differences spanning orders of magnitude between different DRP. Despite an estimated, uniform set of constants used in the model for all DRP, and a heterogeneously treated group of patients higher total and organ-specific T cell counts were associated with cumulative incidence of GVHD in recipients in Cox proportional hazard models. In conclusion, exome wide sequence differences and the variable alloreactive peptide binding to HLA in each DRP yields a large range of possible alloreactive donor T cell responses. Our findings also help understand the apparent randomness observed in the development of alloimmune responses.",

HT upregulated hydrogen peroxide and dehydroascorbate reductase 1 production in both WT and atg5-1 anthers, but the basal levels were already higher in the mutant.

Does the effect of red on competition extend to humans?

Here we show that the results do not replicate in an equivalent, independent dataset for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and that there is substantial variation in the fraction of wins by red across sports in both years. We uncover a number of shortcomings with the research design, analysis, and interpretation underlying the original results. For example, the variation observed in the data may reflect bias towards wins by one color over the other, linked to specific features of the tournament structure for the sports analysed. Reanalysis of the data to address these shortcomings indicates that there is no evidence for an effect of red on the outcomes of Olympic combat sports. Our results refute past claims based on analysis of this system, challenging the related notion that any effect of red in human competition is an evolved response shaped by sexual selection.",

Estrogens also activate the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), however the function of GPER in vivo is less well understood. Here we find that GPER is required to maintain normal heart rate in zebrafish embryos. Acute exposure to estrogens increased heart rate in wildtype and in ER and ER{beta} mutant embryos but not in GPER mutants. Nuclear estrogen receptor signaling remained normal in GPER mutant embryos, however GPER mutant embryos exhibited reduced basal heart rate while heart rate was normal in ER and ER{beta} mutants. We detected GPER transcript in discrete regions of the brain but not in the heart. In the brain, we observed gper expression in cells lacking nuclear estrogen receptor activity, suggesting that GPER acts in the brain to regulate heart rate independently of nuclear estrogen receptor signaling. Our results demonstrate that estradiol plays a previously unappreciated role in the acute modulation of heart rate during zebrafish embryonic development and that GPER functions as an autonomous estrogen receptor in vivo to regulate basal heart rate.",
