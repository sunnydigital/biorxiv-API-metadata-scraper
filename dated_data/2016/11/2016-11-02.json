    "abstract": "The local field potential (LFP) is generated by large populations of neurons, but unitary contribution of spiking neurons to LFP is not well characterised. We investigated this contribution in multi-electrode array recordings from human and monkey neocortex by examining the spike-triggered LFP average (st-LFP). The resulting st-LFPs were dominated by broad spatio-temporal components due to ongoing activity, synaptic inputs and recurrent connectivity. To reduce the spatial reach of the st-LFP and observe the local field related to a single spike we applied a spatial filter, whose weights were adapted to the covariance of ongoing LFP. The filtered st-LFPs were limited to the perimeter of 800 m around the neuron, and propagated at axonal speed, which is consistent with their unitary nature. In addition, we discriminated between putative inhibitory and excitatory neurons and found that the inhibitory st-LFP peaked at shorter latencies, consistently with previous findings in hippocampal slices. Thus, in human and monkey neocortex, the LFP reflects primarily inhibitory neuron activity.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the complex mutation patterns that give rise to drug resistant viral strains provides a foundation for developing more effective treatment strategies for HIV/AIDS. Multiple sequence alignments of drug-experienced HIV-1 protease sequences contain networks of many pair correlations which can be used to build a (Potts) Hamiltonian model of these mutation patterns. Using this Hamiltonian model we translate HIV protease sequence covariation data into quantitative predictions for the probability of observing specific mutation patterns which are in agreement with the observed sequence statistics. We find that the statistical energies of the Potts model are correlated with the fitness of individual proteins containing therapy-associated mutations as estimated by in vitro measurements of protein stability and viral infectivity. We show that the penalty for acquiring primary resistance mutations depends on the epistatic interactions with the sequence background. Primary mutations which lead to drug resistance can become highly advantageous (or entrenched) by the complex mutation patterns which arise in response to drug therapy despite being destabilizing in the wildtype background. Anticipating epistatic effects is important for the design of future protease inhibitor therapies.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, is an abundant environmental bacterium that can efficiently colonize the intestinal tract and trigger severe diarrheal illness. Motility, and the production of colonization factors and cholera toxin, are fundamental for the establishment of disease. In the aquatic environment, V. cholerae persists by forming avirulent biofilms on zooplankton, phytoplankton and chitin debris. Here, we describe the formation of artificial, biofilm-like communities, driven by exposure of planktonic bacteria to synthetic polymers. This recruitment is extremely rapid and charge-driven, and leads to the formation of initial \\\"seed clusters\\\" which then recruit additional bacteria to extend in size. Bacteria that become entrapped in these \\\"forced communities\\\" undergo transcriptional changes in motility and virulence genes, and phenotypically mimic features of environmental biofilm communities by forming a matrix that contains polysaccharide and extracellular DNA. As a result of this lifestyle transition, pathogenicity and in vivo host colonization decrease. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic polymers to disarm pathogens by modulating their lifestyle, without creating selective pressure favoring the emergence of antimicrobial resistant strains.",

Rarity is recognised as a necessary, although not sufficient, criterion for pathogenicity, but frequency cutoffs used in Mendelian analysis are often arbitrary and overly lenient. Recent very large reference datasets, such as the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), provide an unprecedented opportunity to obtain robust frequency estimates even for very rare variants. Here we present a statistical framework for the frequency-based filtering of candidate disease-causing variants, accounting for disease prevalence, genetic and allelic heterogeneity, inheritance mode, penetrance, and sampling variance in reference datasets. Using the example of cardiomyopathy, we show that our approach reduces by two-thirds the number of candidate variants under consideration in the average exome, and identifies 43 variants previously reported as pathogenic that can now be reclassified. We present precomputed allele frequency cutoffs for all variants in the ExAC dataset.",

    "abstract": "Mareks disease virus is a herpesvirus of chickens that costs the worldwide poultry industry over 1 billion USD annually. Two generations of Mareks disease vaccines have shown reduced efficacy over the last half century due to evolution of the virus. Understanding where the virus is present may give insight into whether continued reductions in efficacy are likely. We conducted a three-year surveillance study to assess the prevalence of Mareks disease virus on commercial poultry farms, determine the effect of various factors on virus prevalence, and document virus dynamics in broiler chicken houses over short (weeks) and long (years) timescales. We extracted DNA from dust samples collected from commercial chicken and egg production facilities in Pennsylvania, USA. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to assess wild-type virus detectability and concentration. Using data from 1018 dust samples with Bayesian generalized linear mixed effects models, we determined the factors that correlated with virus prevalence across farms. Maximum likelihood and autocorrelation function estimation on 3727 additional dust samples were used to document and characterize virus concentrations within houses over time. Overall, wild-type virus was detectable at least once on 36 of 104 farms at rates that varied substantially between farms. Virus was detected in 1 of 3 broiler-breeder operations (companies), 4 of 5 broiler operations, and 3 of 5 egg layer operations. Mareks disease virus detectability differed by production type, bird age, day of the year, operation (company), farm, house, flock, and sample. Operation (company) was the most important factor, accounting for between 12% and 63.4% of the variation in virus detectability. Within individual houses, virus concentration often dropped below detectable levels and reemerged later. These data characterize Mareks disease virus dynamics, which are potentially important to the evolution of the virus.",

    "abstract": "The primary electrophysiological marker of feature-based selection is the N2pc, a lateralized posterior negativity emerging around 180-200 ms. As it relies on hemispheric differences, its ability to discriminate the locus of focal attention is severely limited. Here we demonstrate that multivariate analyses of raw EEG data provide a much more fine-grained spatial profile of feature-based target selection. When training a pattern classifier to determine target position from EEG, we were able to decode target positions on the vertical midline, which cannot be achieved using standard N2pc methodology. Next, we used a forward encoding model to construct a channel tuning function that describes the continuous relationship between target position and multivariate EEG in an eight-position display. This model can spatially discriminate individual target positions in these displays and is fully invertible, enabling us to construct hypothetical topographic activation maps for target positions that were never used. When tested against the real pattern of neural activity obtained from a different group of subjects, the constructed maps from the forward model turned out statistically indistinguishable, thus providing independent validation of our model. Our findings demonstrate the power of multivariate EEG analysis to track feature-based target selection with high spatial and temporal precision.\\n\\nSignificance StatementFeature-based attentional selection enables observers to find objects in their visual field. The spatiotemporal profile of this process is difficult to assess with standard electrophysiological methods, which rely on activity differences between cerebral hemispheres. We demonstrate that multivariate analyses of EEG data can track target selection across the visual field with high temporal and spatial resolution. Using a forward model, we were able to capture the continuous relationship between target position and EEG measurements, allowing us to reconstruct the distribution of cortical activity for target locations that were never shown during the experiment. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a temporally and spatially precise EEG signal that can be used to study the neural basis of feature-based attentional selection.",

    "abstract": "The behavioural rhythms of organisms are thought to be under strong selection, influenced by the rhythmicity of the environment1-4. Such behavioural rhythms are well studied in isolated individuals under laboratory conditions1,5, but free-living individuals have to temporally synchronize their activities with those of others, including potential mates, competitors, prey and predators6-10. Individuals can temporally segregate their daily activities (e.g. prey avoiding predators, subordinates avoiding dominants) or synchronize their activities (e.g. group foraging, communal defence, pairs reproducing or caring for offspring)6-9,11. The behavioural rhythms that emerge from such social synchronization and the underlying evolutionary and ecological drivers that shape them remain poorly understood5-7,9. Here, we address this in the context of biparental care, a particularly sensitive phase of social synchronization12 where pair members potentially compromise their individual rhythms. Using data from 729 nests of 91 populations of 32 biparentally-incubating shorebird species, where parents synchronize to achieve continuous coverage of developing eggs, we report remarkable within- and between-species diversity in incubation rhythms. Between species, the median length of one parents incubation bout varied from 1 - 19 hours, while period length-the time in which a parents probability to incubate cycles once between its highest and lowest value - varied from 6 - 43 hours. The length of incubation bouts was unrelated to variables reflecting energetic demands, but species relying on crypsis (the ability to avoid detection by other animals) had longer incubation bouts than those that are readily visible or actively protect their nest against predators. Rhythms entrainable to the 24-h light-dark cycle were less prevalent at high latitudes and absent in 18 species. Our results indicate that even under similar environmental conditions and despite 24-h environmental cues, social synchronization can generate far more diverse behavioural rhythms than expected from studies of individuals in captivity5-7,9. The risk of predation, not the risk of starvation, may be a key factor underlying the diversity in these rhythms.",

    "abstract": "Despite much effort to probe the properties of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution, effects of DMSO on water, especially near plasma membrane surfaces still remain elusive. By performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at varying DMSO concentrations (XDMSO), we study how DMSO affects structural and dynamical properties of water in the vicinity of phospholipid bilayers. As proposed by a number of experiments, our simulations confirm that DMSO induces dehydration from bilayer surfaces and disrupts the H-bond structure of water. However, DMSO enhanced water diffusivity at solvent-bilayer interfaces, an intriguing discovery reported by a spin-label measurement, is not confirmed in our simulations. In order to resolve this discrepancy, we examine the location of the spin-label (Tempo), relative to the solvent-bilayer interface. In accord with the evidence in the literature, our simulations, which explicitly model Tempo-PC, find that the Tempo moiety is equilibrated at ~ 8 - 10 [A] below the bilayer surface. Furthermore, the DMSO-enhanced surface water diffusion is confirmed only when water diffusion is analyzed around the Tempo moiety that is immersed below the bilayer surface, which implies that the experimentally detected signal of water using Tempo stems from the interior of bilayers, not from the interface. Our analysis finds that the increase of water diffusion below the bilayer surface is coupled to the increase of area per lipid with an increasing XDMSO ([lsim] 10 mol%). Underscoring the hydrophobic nature of Tempo moiety, our study calls for careful re-evaluation of the use of Tempo in the measurement on lipid bilayer surfaces.",

We investigated the growth of point sets on an interval as a model of the origin of proto-plants, which are formed due to endosymbiosis of cyanobacteria and protists. The fractal properties of the sets of evenly placed points and group sets were studied using the box-counting method. For the group sets, the character of dependence  on the growing total number of points changes radically differently depending on whether the number of the points per group or the number of groups was fixed. As the host does not have the initial infrastructure needed for an increase in cyanobacteria per group, the first path is implemented and  decreases from 1 to 0.25 when groups consist of two points per group. If and when the host develops necessary anatomical features (infrastructure), the second pathway is realized and  grows to 1. The combined trajectory of  initially demonstrates a slow growth of the size of the photosynthetic system and then an exponential growth after the development of the hosts infrastructure. Similar fractal peculiarity also characterizes trees and is an innate property of plants. Assumptions on the morphological recapitulation of proto-plant in higher plants ontogenesis (embryogenesis and seed germination) and also a possibility to fix the number of cyanobacteria per group are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion weight imaging became a conventional tool to study brain connectivity in healthy and diseased individuals. However, both techniques provide indirect measures of brain connectivity leading to controversies on their interpretation. Among these controversies, interpretation of anti-correlated functional connections and global average signal is a major challenge for the field. In this paper, we used dynamic functional connectivity to calculate the probability of anti-correlations between brain regions. The brain regions forming task-positive and task-negative networks showed high anti-correlation probabilities. The fluctuations in anti-correlation probabilities were significantly correlated with those in global average signal and functional connectivity. We investigated the mechanisms behind these fluctuations using whole-brain computational modeling approach. We found that the underlying effective connectivity and intrinsic noise reflect the static spatiotemporal patterns, whereas the hemodynamic response function is the key factor defining the fluctuations in functional connectivity and anti-correlations. Furthermore, we illustrated the clinical implications of these findings on a group of bipolar disorder patients suffering a depressive relapse (BPD).",

    "abstract": "It was claimed in a recently published article that MIF functions as an exo/endo-DNase mediating cell-death upon being induced by DNA damage and PARP1. MIF, for which tautomerase activity has been previously reported, is a member of the tautomerase superfamily which does not feature nucleases. The central premise of the authors to suggest that MIF functions as a DNase is the supposed structural relationship to nucleases of the Restriction endonuclease (REase) fold, which frequently but not always contain a motif of the form PD-(D/E)XK. However, we present evidence to show that this claim is entirely unsupported.",

    "abstract": "In the human genome, distal enhancers are involved in regulating target genes through proxi-mal promoters by forming enhancer-promoter interactions. Although recently developed high-throughput experimental approaches have allowed us to recognize potential enhancer-promoter interactions genome-wide, it is still largely unclear to what extent the sequence-level information encoded in our genome help guide such interactions. Here we report a new computational method (named \\\"SPEID\\\") using deep learning models to predict enhancer-promoter interactions based on sequence-based features only, when the locations of putative enhancers and promoters in a particular cell type are given. Our results across six different cell types demonstrate that SPEID is effective in predicting enhancer-promoter interactions as compared to state-of-the-art methods that only use information from a single cell type. As a proof-of-principle, we also applied SPEID to identify somatic non-coding mutations in melanoma samples that may have reduced enhancer-promoter interactions in tumor genomes. This work demonstrates that deep learning models can help reveal that sequence-based features alone are sufficient to reliably predict enhancer-promoter interactions genome-wide.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria predominantly exist as members of surfaced-attached communities known as biofilms. Many bacterial species initiate biofilms and adhere to each other using cell surface adhesins. This is the case for numerous ecologically diverse -proteobacteria, which use polar exopolysaccharide adhesins for cell-cell adhesion and surface attachment. Here, we show that Rhodopseudomonas palustris, a metabolically versatile member of the -proteobacterial order Rhizobiales, encodes a functional unipolar polysaccharide (UPP) biosynthesis gene cluster. Deletion of genes predicted to be critical for UPP biosynthesis and export abolished UPP production. We also found that R. palustris uses UPP to mediate biofilm formation across diverse photoheterotrophic growth conditions, wherein light and organic substrates are used to support growth. However, UPP was less important for biofilm formation during photoautotrophy, where light and CO2 support growth, and during aerobic respiration with organic compounds. Expanding our analysis beyond R. palustris, we examined the phylogenetic distribution and genomic organization of UPP gene clusters among Rhizobiales species that inhabit diverse niches. Our analysis suggests that UPP is a conserved ancestral trait of the Rhizobiales but that it has been independently lost multiple times during the evolution of this clade, twice coinciding with adaptation to intracellular lifestyles within animal hosts.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBacteria are ubiquitously found as surface-attached communities and cellular aggregates in nature. Here, we address how bacterial adhesion is coordinated in response to diverse environments using two complementary approaches. First, we examined how Rhodopseudomonas palustris, one of the most metabolically versatile organisms ever described, varies its adhesion to surfaces in response to different environmental conditions. We identified 2 critical genes for the production of a unipolar polysaccharide (UPP) and showed that UPP is important for adhesion when light and organic substrates are used for growth. Looking beyond R. palustris, we performed the most comprehensive survey to date on the conservation of UPP biosynthesis genes among a group of closely related bacteria that occupy diverse niches. Our findings suggest that UPP is important for free-living and plant-associated lifestyles but dispensable for animal pathogens. Additionally, we propose guidelines for classifying the adhesins produced by various -proteobacteria, facilitating future functional and comparative studies.",

    "abstract": "Between-sample normalization is a critical step in genomic data analysis to remove systematic bias and unwanted technical variation in high-throughput data. Global normalization methods are based on the assumption that observed variability in global properties is due to technical reasons and are unrelated to the biology of interest. For example, some methods correct for differences in sequencing read counts by scaling features to have similar median values across samples, but these fail to reduce other forms of unwanted technical variation. Methods such as quantile normalization transform the statistical distributions across samples to be the same and assume global differences in the distribution are induced by only technical variation. However, it remains unclear how to proceed with normalization if these assumptions are violated, for example if there are global differences in the statistical distributions between biological conditions or groups, and external information, such as negative or control features, is not available. Here we introduce a generalization of quantile normalization, referred to as smooth quantile normalization (qsmooth), which is based on the assumption that the statistical distribution of each sample should be the same (or have the same distributional shape) within biological groups or conditions, but allowing that they may differ between groups. We illustrate the advantages of our method on several high-throughput datasets with global differences in distributions corresponding to different biological conditions. We also perform a Monte Carlo simulation study to illustrate the bias-variance tradeoff of qsmooth compared to other global normalization methods.

    "abstract": "How chromosomes fold into 3D structures and how genome functions are affected or even controlled by their spatial organization remain challenging questions. Hi-C experiment has provided important structural insights for chromosome, and Hi-C data are used here to construct the 3D chromatin structure which are characterized by two spatially segregated chromatin compartments A and B. By mapping a plethora of genome features onto the constructed 3D chromatin model, we show vividly the close connection between genome properties and the spatial organization of chromatin. We are able to dissect the whole chromatin into two types of chromatin domains which have clearly different Hi-C contact patterns as well as different sizes of chromatin loops. The two chromatin types can be respectively regarded as the basic units of chromatin compartments A and B, and also spatially segregate from each other as the two chromatin compartments. Therefore, the chromatin loops segregate in the space according to their sizes, suggesting the excluded volume or entropic effect in chromatin compartmentalization as well as chromosome positioning. Taken together, these results provide clues to the folding principles of chromosomes, their spatial organization, and the resulted clustering of many genome features in the 3D space.",

    "abstract": "Although an implicit assumption of speciation biology is that population differentiation is an important stage of evolutionary diversification, its true significance remains largely untested. If population differentiation within a species is related to its speciation rate over evolutionary time, the causes of differentiation could also be driving dynamics of organismal diversity across time and space. Alternatively, geographic variants might be short-lived entities with rates of formation that are unlinked to speciation rates, in which case the causes of differentiation would have only ephemeral impacts. Combining population genetics datasets including 17,746 individuals from 176 New World bird species with speciation rates estimated from phylogenetic data, we show that the population differentiation rates within species predict their speciation rates over long timescales. Although relatively little variance in speciation rate is explained by population differentiation rate, the relationship between the two is robust to diverse strategies of sampling and analyzing both population-level and species-level datasets. Population differentiation occurs at least three to five times faster than speciation, suggesting that most populations are ephemeral. Population differentiation and speciation rates are more tightly linked in tropical species than temperate species, consistent with a history of more stable diversification dynamics through time in the Tropics. Overall, our results suggest investigations into the processes responsible for population differentiation can reveal factors that contribute to broad-scale patterns of diversity.",

    "abstract": "The ecological traits of organisms may predict important evolutionary parameters such as genetic diversity, population genetic structure, and demographic history. Making these ecological-evolutionary links is difficult because robust, comparable genetic estimates are required from many species with differing ecologies. In Amazonian birds, differences in habitat preference are an important component of ecological diversity. A subset of Amazonian birds is restricted to forest edge and open forest along floodplains, whereas another subset occurs only in the interior of tall, upland forest. Here, we examine the link between habitat and evolutionary metrics using 20 pairs of closely related and co-distributed bird species in which one member of the pair occurs primarily in forest edge and floodplains, and the other occurs in upland forest interior. We use standardized geographic sampling and genomic data from the same set of 2,416 independent markers to estimate genetic diversity, population structure, and demographic history in each species. We find that species of upland forest have higher genetic diversity, greater divergence across the landscape, more genetically distinct populations, and deeper gene histories than floodplain species. Our results reveal that species ecology in the form of habitat preference is an important predictor of genetic diversity and divergence and suggest that floodplain and upland avifaunas in the Amazon may be on separate evolutionary trajectories and require different conservation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), researchers have identified hundreds of genetic variants associated with particular complex traits. Previous studies have compared the pattern of association signals across different populations in real data, and these have detected differences in the strength and sometimes even the direction of GWAS signals. These differences could be due to a combination of (1) lack of power (insufficient sample sizes); (2) minor allele frequency (MAF) differences (again affecting power); (3) linkage disequilibrium (LD) differences (affecting power to  tag the causal variant); and (4) true differences in causal variant effect sizes (defined by relative risks).\\n\\nIn the present work, we sought to assess whether the first three of these reasons are sufficient on their own to explain the observed incidence of trans-ethnic differences in replications of GWAS signals, or whether the fourth reason is also required. We simulated case-control data of European, Asian and African ancestry, drawing on observed MAF and LD patterns seen in the 1000-Genomes reference dataset and assuming the true causal relative risks were the same in all three populations.\\n\\nWe found that a combination of Euro-centric SNP selection and between-population differences in LD, accentuated by the lower SNP density typical of older GWAS panels, was sufficient to explain the rate of trans-ethnic differences previously reported, without the need to assume between-population differences in true causal SNP effect size. This suggests a cross-population consistency that has implications for our understanding of the interplay between genetics and environment in the aetiology of complex human diseases.",

It converts arbitrary binary input patterns into sparse distributed representations (SDRs) using a combination of competitive Hebbian learning rules and homeostatic excitability control. We describe a number of key properties of the spatial pooler, including fast adaptation to changing input statistics, improved noise robustness through learning, efficient use of cells and robustness to cell death. In order to quantify these properties we develop a set of metrics that can be directly computed from the spatial pooler outputs. We show how the properties are met using these metrics and targeted artificial simulations. We then demonstrate the value of the spatial pooler in a complete end-to-end real-world HTM system. We discuss the relationship with neuroscience and previous studies of sparse coding.

    "abstract": "In a wide variety of research elds, dynamic modeling is employed as an instrument to learn and understand complex systems. The differential equations involved in this process are usually non-linear and depend on many parameters whose values decide upon the characteristics of the emergent system. The inverse problem, i.e. the inference or estimation of parameter values from observed data, is of interest from two points of view. First, the existence point of view, dealing with the question whether the system is able to reproduce the observed dynamics for any parameter values. Second, the identi ability point of view, investigating invariance of the prediction under change of parameter values, as well as the quanti cation of parameter uncertainty.\\n\\nIn this paper, we present the R package dMod providing a framework for dealing with the inverse problem in dynamic systems. The particularity of the approach taken by dMod is to provide and propagate accurate derivatives computed from symbolic expres-sions wherever possible. This derivative information highly supports the convergence of optimization routines and enhances their numerical stability, a requirement for the appli-cability of so sticated uncertainty analysis methods. Computational efficiency is achieved by automatic generation and execution of C code. The framework is object oriented (S3) and provides a variety of functions to set up dynamic models, observation functions and parameter transformations for multi-conditional parameter estimation.\\n\\nThe key elements of the framework and the methodology implemented in dMod are highlighted by an application on a three-compartment transporter model.",

    "abstract": "All cells respond to osmotic challenges, including those imposed during normal growth and development. Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels provide a conserved mechanism for regulating osmotic forces by conducting ions in response to increased membrane tension. We previously demonstrated that the MS ion channel MscS-Like 8 (MSL8) is required for pollen to survive multiple osmotic challenges that occur during the normal process of fertilization, and that it can inhibit pollen germination. However, it remained unclear whether these physiological functions required ion flux through a mechanically gated channel provided by MSL8. We introduced two point mutations into the predicted pore-lining domain of MSL8 that disrupted normal channel function in different ways. The Ile711Ser mutation increased the tension threshold of the MSL8 channel while leaving conductance unchanged, and the Phe720Leu mutation severely disrupted the MSL8 channel. Both of these mutations impaired the ability of MSL8 to preserve pollen viability during hydration and to maintain the integrity of the pollen tube when expressed at endogenous levels. When overexpressed in a msl8-4 null background, MSL8I711S could partially rescue loss-of-function phenotypes, while MSL8F720L could not. When overexpressed in the wild type Ler background, MSL8I711S suppressed pollen germination, similar to wild type MSL8. In contrast, MSL8F720L failed to suppress pollen germination and increased pollen bursting, thereby phenocopying the msl8-4 mutant. Thus, an intact MSL8 channel is required to for normal pollen function during hydration and germination. These data establish MSL8 as the first plant MS channel to fulfill previously established criteria for assignment as a mechanotransducer.",

    "abstract": "Multiple and unpredictable numbers of actions are often required to achieve a goal. In order to organize behavior and allocate effort so that optimal behavioral policies can be selected, it is necessary to continually monitor ongoing actions. Real-time processing of information related to actions and outcomes is typically assigned to the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia, but also depends on midbrain regions, especially the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We were interested in how individual VTA neurons, as well as networks within the VTA, encode salient events when an unpredictable number of serial actions are required to obtain a reward. We recorded from ensembles of putative dopamine and non-dopamine neurons in the VTA as animals performed multiple cued trials in a recording session where, in each trial, serial actions were randomly rewarded. While averaging population activity did not reveal a response pattern, we observed that different neurons selectively tuned to low, medium, or high numbered actions in a trial. This preferential tuning of putative dopamine and non-dopamine VTA neurons to different subsets of actions in a trial allowed information about binned action number to be decoded from the ensemble activity. At the network level, tuning curve similarity was positively associated with action-evoked noise correlations, suggesting that action number selectivity reflects functional connectivity within these networks. Analysis of phasic responses to cue and reward revealed that the requirement to execute multiple and uncertain numbers of actions weakens both cue-evoked responses and cue-reward response correlation. The functional connectivity and ensemble coding scheme that we observe here may allow VTA neurons to cooperatively provide a real-time account of ongoing behavior. These computations may be critical to cognitive and motivational functions that have long been associated with VTA dopamine neurons.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChromatin conformation capture techniques have evolved rapidly over the last few years and have provided new insights into genome organization at an unprecedented resolution. Analysis of Hi-C data is complex and computationally intensive involving multiple tasks and requiring robust quality assessment. This has led to the development of several tools and methods for processing Hi-C data. However, most of the existing tools do not cover all aspects of the analysis and only offer few quality assessment options. Additionally, availability of a multitude of tools makes scientists wonder how these tools and associated parameters can be optimally used, and how potential discrepancies can be interpreted and resolved. Most importantly, investigators need to be ensured that slight changes in parameters and/or methods do not affect the conclusions of their studies.\\n\\nResultsTo address these issues (compare, explore and reproduce), we introduce HiC-bench, a configurable computational platform for comprehensive and reproducible analysis of Hi-C sequencing data. HiC-bench performs all common Hi-C analysis tasks, such as alignment, filtering, contact matrix generation and normalization, identification of topological domains, scoring and annotation of specific interactions using both published tools and our own. We have also embedded various tasks that perform quality assessment and visualization. HiC-bench is implemented as a data flow platform with an emphasis on analysis reproducibility. Additionally, the user can readily perform parameter exploration and comparison of different tools in a combinatorial manner that takes into account all desired parameter settings in each pipeline task. This unique feature facilitates the design and execution of complex benchmark studies that may involve combinations of multiple tool/parameter choices in each step of the analysis. To demonstrate the usefulness of our platform, we performed a comprehensive benchmark of existing and new TAD callers exploring different matrix correction methods, parameter settings and sequencing depths. Users can extend our pipeline by adding more tools as they become available.\\n\\nConclusionsHiC-bench consists an easy-to-use and extensible platform for comprehensive analysis of Hi-C datasets. We expect that it will facilitate current analyses and help scientists formulate and test new hypotheses in the field of three-dimensional genome organization.",

    "abstract": "Very little is currently known about the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region of cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis; Mafa) from Chinese breeding centers. We performed comprehensive MHC class I haplotype analysis of 100 cynomolgus macaques from two different centers, with animals from different reported original geographic origins (Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Cambodian/Indonesian mixed-origin). Many of the samples were of known relation to each other (sire, dam, and progeny sets), making it possible to characterize lineage-level haplotypes in these animals. We identified 52 Mafa-A and 74 Mafa-B haplotypes in this cohort, many of which were restricted to specific sample origins. We also characterized full-length MHC class I transcripts using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) RS II single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing. This technology allows for complete read-through of unfragmented MHC class I transcripts (~1,100 bp in length), so no assembly is required to unambiguously resolve novel full-length sequences. Overall, we identified 313 total full-length transcripts in a subset of 72 cynomolgus macaques from these Chinese breeding facilities; 131 of these sequences were novel and an additional 116 extended existing short database sequences to span the complete open reading frame. This significantly expands the number of Mafa-A, Mafa-B, and Mafa-I full-length alleles in the official cynomolgus macaque MHC class I database. The PacBio technique described here represents a general method for full-length allele discovery and genotyping that can be extended to other complex immune loci such as MHC class II, killer immunoglobulin-like receptors, and Fc gamma receptors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundArtemisinin-based combination therapies are the first line of treatment for Plasmodium falciparum infections worldwide, but artemisinin resistance (ART-R) has risen rapidly in in Southeast Asia over the last decade. Mutations in kelch13 have been associated with artemisinin (ART) resistance in this region. To explore the power of longitudinal genomic surveillance to detect signals in kelch13 and other loci that contribute to ART or partner drug resistance, we retrospectively sequenced the genomes of 194 P. falciparum isolates from five sites in Northwest Thailand, bracketing the era in which there was a rapid increase in ART-R in this region (2001-2014).\\n\\nResultsWe evaluated statistical metrics for temporal change in the frequency of individual SNPs, assuming that SNPs associated with resistance should increase frequency over this period. After Kelch13-C580Y, the strongest temporal change was seen at a SNP in phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K), situated in a pathway recently implicated in the ART-R mechanism. However, other loci exhibit temporal signatures nearly as strong, and warrant further investigation for involvement in ART-R evolution. Through genome-wide association analysis we also identified a variant in a kelch-domain-containing gene on chromosome 10 that may epistatically modulate ART-R.\\n\\nConclusionsThis analysis demonstrates the potential of a longitudinal genomic surveillance approach to detect resistance-associated loci and improve our mechanistic understanding of how resistance develops. Evidence for additional genomic regions outside of the kelch13 locus associated with ART-R parasites may yield new molecular markers for resistance surveillance and may retard the emergence or spread of ART-R in African parasite populations.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a potentially life-threatening genetic vascular disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), endoglin, Smad4, and bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9). Injections of mouse neonates with BMP9/10 blocking antibodies lead to HHT-like vascular defects in the postnatal retinal angiogenesis model. Mothers and newborns share the same immunity through the transfer of maternal antibodies during breastfeeding. Here, we investigated whether the transmammary delivery route could improve the ease and consistency of administering anti-BMP9/10 antibodies in the postnatal retinal angiogenesis model. We found that anti-BMP9/10 antibodies, when intraperitoneally injected into lactating dams, are efficiently transferred into the circulation of breastfed neonatal pups. Strikingly, pups receiving anti-BMP9/10 antibodies via breastfeeding displayed consistent and robust vascular pathology in the retina, which included hypervascularization and defects in arteriovenous specification, as well as the presence of multiple and massive arteriovenous malformations. Furthermore, RNA-Seq analyses of neonatal retinas identified an increase in the key pro-angiogenic factor, angiopoietin-2, as the most significant change in gene expression triggered by the transmammary delivery of anti-BMP9/10 antibodies. Transmammary-delivered BMP9/10 immunoblocking in the mouse neonatal retina is therefore a practical, noninvasive, reliable, and robust model of HHT vascular pathology.",

    "abstract": "Naturalistic viewing paradigms such as movies have been shown to reduce participant head motion and improve arousal during fMRI scanning relative to task-free rest, and have been used to study both functional connectivity and task-evoked BOLD-signal changes. These task-evoked changes result in cortical activity that is synchronized across subjects and involves large areas of the cortex, and it is unclear whether individual differences in functional connectivity are enhanced or diminished under such naturalistic conditions. This work first aims to characterize variability in functional connectivity (FC) across two distinct movie conditions and eyes-open rest (n=34 healthy adults, 2 scan sessions each). At the whole-brain level, we found that movies have higher intra- and inter-subject correlations in cluster-wise FC relative to rest. The anatomical distribution of inter-subject variability was similar across conditions, with higher variability occurring at the lateral prefrontal lobes and temporoparietal junctions. Second, we used an unsupervised test-retest matching (or \\\"finger-printin\\\") algorithm that identifies individual subjects from within a group based on functional connectivity patterns, quantifying the accuracy of the algorithm across the three conditions. We also evaluated the impact of parcellation resolution, scan duration, and number of edges on observed inter-individual differences. The movies and resting state all enabled identification of individual subjects based on FC matrices, with accuracies between 62 and 100%. Overall, pairings involving movies outperformed rest, and the more social and faster-paced movie attained 100% accuracy. When the parcellation resolution, scan duration and number of edges used were increased, accuracies improved across conditions, and the pattern of movies>rest was preserved. These results suggest that using dynamic stimuli such as movies enhances the detection of FC patterns that are distinct at the individual level.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIIntra- and inter-subject FC correlations are compared across rest and movies.\\nC_LIO_LIMovies outperformed rest in an unsupervised identification algorithm based on FC.\\nC_LIO_LIMovies outperform rest regardless of parcellation, scan length, or number of edges.\\nC_LIO_LIWatching movies enhances the detection of individual differences in FC.\\nC_LI",

Moreover, isoflurane affected neuronal plasticity by facilitating long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. We also found that isoflurane increased activity of the parvalbumin interneurons, and facilitated GABAergic transmission in wild type mice but not in transgenic mice with reduced TrkB expression in parvalbumin interneurons.

We hypothesized that publication of a pivotal pre-hospital clinical trial (RAMPART), demonstrating superiority of intramuscular midazolam over intravenous lorazepam, altered the national utilization rates of midazolam for pre-hospital treatment of status epilepticus, while upholding its safety and efficacy outside the trial setting.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsThis is a retrospective, observational cohort study of pre-hospital patient encounters throughout the United States in the National Emergency Medicine Services Information System database, from January 2010 through December 2014. We compared the rates and odds of midazolam use as the first-line treatment for status epilepticus among all adult and pediatric benzodiazepine-treated seizures before and after RAMPART publication (February 2012). Secondary analyses were conducted for rates of airway interventions and rescue therapy, as proxies for safety and efficacy of seizure termination. 156,539 benzodiazepine-treated seizures were identified. Midazolam use increased from 26.1% in January 2010 to 61.7% in December 2014 (difference +35.6%, 95% CI, 32.7%-38.4%). The annual rate of midazolam adoption increased significantly from 5.9% per year to 8.9% per year after the publication of RAMPART (difference +3.0% per year; 95%CI, 1.6%-4.5% per year; adjusted OR 1.24; 95%CI, 1.17-1.32). Overall frequency of rescue therapy and airway interventions changed little after the publication of RAMPART.\\n\\nConclusionsThese data are consistent with effective, ongoing, but incomplete clinical translation of the RAMPART results. The effects of the trial, however, cannot be isolated. The safety and effectiveness of midazolam for treatment of seizures in prehospital clinical practice appear consistent with trial data, which should encourage continuing increases in utilization.",

Due to their past incremental accumulation and ongoing DNA transposition of members from certain subfamilies, MEs serve as a significant source for both inter- and intra-species genetic diversity during primate and human evolution. Since MEs can exert direct impact on gene function via a plethora of mechanism, it is believed that the ME-derived genetic diversity has contributed to the phenotypic differences between human and non-human primates, as well as among human populations and individuals. To define the specific contribution of MEs in making Human sapiens as a biologically unique species, we aim to compile a complete list of MEs that are only uniquely present in the human genome, i.e., human-specific MEs (HS-MEs).\\n\\nBy making use of the most recent reference genome sequences for human and many other primates and a unbiased more robust and integrative multi-way comparative genomic approach, we identified a total of 15,463 HS-MEs. This list of HS-MEs represents a 120% increase from prior studies with over 8,000 being newly identified as HS-MEs. Collectively, these ~15,000 HS-MEs have contributed to a total of 15 million base pair (Mbp) sequence increase through insertion, generation of target site duplications, and transductions, as well as a 0.5 Mbp sequence loss via insertion- mediated deletions, leading to a net total of 14.5 Mbp genome size increase. Other new observations made with these HS-MEs include: 1) identification of several additional ME subfamilies with significant transposition activities not visible with prior smaller datasets (e.g. L1HS, L1PA2, and HERV-K); 2) A clear similarity of the retrotransposition mechanism among L1, Alus, and SVAs that is distinct from HERVs based on the pre- integration site sequence motifs; 3) Y-chromosome as a strikingly hot target for HS-MEs, particularly for LTRs, which showed an insertion rate 15 times higher than the genome average; 4) among the ME types, SVAs seem to show a very strong bias in inserting into existing SVAs. Among the HS-MEs, more than 8,000 elements were integrated into the vicinity of ~4900 unique genes, in regions including CDS, untranslated exon regions, promoters, and introns of protein coding genes, as well as promoters and exons of non- coding RNAs. In seven cases, MEs participate in protein coding. Furthermore, 1,213 HS-MEs contributed to a total of 3,124 experimentally identified binding sites for 146 of the 161 transcriptional factors in association with 622 genes. All these data suggest that these HS-MEs, despite being very young, already showed sufficient sign for their participation in gene function via regulation of transcription, splicing, and protein coding, with more potential for future participation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that the amount of MEs uniquely occurred in the human genome is much higher than previously known, and we predict that the same is true regarding their impact on human genome evolution and function. The comprehensive list of HS-MEs provides an important reference resource for studying the impact of DNA transposition in human genome evolution and gene function.",

    "abstract": "Detecting interaction between species is notoriously difficult, and disentangling species associations in host-related gut communities is especially challenging. Nevertheless, due to contemporary methods, including metabarcoding and 16S sequencing, collecting observational data on community composition has become easier and much more common. We studied the previously collected data sets of intestinal microbiota and parasite compositions within longitudinally followed mouse lemurs by analysing the potential interactions with diversity metrics and novel joint species distribution modelling. Both methods showed consistent statistical association between certain parasite species and microbiotal composition. Both unicellular Eimeria sp. and cestode Hymenolepis diminuta had an effect on diversity of gut microbiota. These parasite species also had negative associations with several bacterial orders. In comparison, closely related species H. nana did not have an effect on diversity, and it had positive associations with several bacterial orders. Our results reveal potential interactions between some, but not all, intestinal parasites and gut microbiota. While environmental variables explained almost half of the total variation, of which almost half could be explained by traits of parasites and microbiota, there were no clear patterns regarding mouse lemur individual variables explaining variation in the occurrence patterns of parasite and microbiota significantly. Our results provide new hypothesis for interactions between and among parasites and microbiota to be tested further with experimental studies.",

    "abstract": "Benzodiazepines and Z-drugs (BZDs), hypnotic drugs used for insomnia and anxiety, are prescribed millions of times a year in the UK. Although guidance from the relevant regulatory authorities (NICE and BNF) indicates them only for short-term use, the evidence suggests that many patients have been taking these drugs for much longer, often for decades. At present, there are no up-to-date, evidence-based estimates of the scale of long-term BZD use in the UK, which has prevented making a strong case for the need for withdrawal services. However, data obtained recently on BZD use from a number of GP surgeries (covering nearly 100,000 registered patients) in the North of England, allow such projections to be calculated. Scaling the results to a national level suggests that there are over a quarter of a million patients in the UK using BZDs for periods far longer than recommended. The projections also suggest that nearly half this number may be willing to accept help to stop their dependency on BZDs. These results indicate a serious problem, which should be addressed by more research into the harms associated with long-term BZD use, the provision of withdrawal services, and a national helpline to support patients with BZD dependency.",
