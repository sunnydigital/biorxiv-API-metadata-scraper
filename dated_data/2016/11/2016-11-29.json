As these technologies become more common, there is a need for computational tools to explore the data they produce.

We implemented an interactive web-tool to visualize single-cell data using force-directed graph layouts, called SPRING. SPRING reveals more detailed biological relationships than existing approaches when applied to branching gene expression trajectories from hematopoietic progenitor cells. Visualizations from SPRING are also more reproducible than those of stochastic visualization methods such as tSNE, a state-of-the-art tool.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://kleintools.hms.harvard.edu/tools/spring.html,https://github.com/AllonKleinLab/SPRING/\\n\\nContactcalebsw@gmail.com, allon_klein@hms.harvard.edu",

    "abstract": "Genomic stability depends on faithful genome replication. This is achieved by the concerted activity of thousands of DNA replication origins (ORIs) scattered throughout the genome. In spite of multiple efforts, the DNA and chromatin features that determine ORI specification are not presently known. We have generated a high-resolution genome-wide map of ORIs in cultured Arabidopsis thaliana cells that rendered a collection of 3230 ORIs. In this study we focused on defining the features associated with ORIs in heterochromatin. We found that while ORIs tend to colocalize with genes in euchromatic gene-rich regions, they frequently colocalize with transposable elements (TEs) in pericentromeric gene-poor domains. Interestingly, ORIs in TEs associate almost exclusively with retrotransposons, in particular, of the Gypsy family. ORI activity in retrotransposons occurs independently of TE expression and while maintaining high levels of H3K9me2 and H3K27me1, typical marks of repressed heterochromatin. ORI-TEs largely colocalize with chromatin signatures defining GC-rich heterochromatin. Importantly, TEs with active ORIs contain a local GC content higher than the TEs lacking them. Our results lead us to conclude that ORI colocalization with TEs is largely limited to retrotransposons, which are defined by their transposition mechanisms based on transcription, and they occur in a specific chromatin landscape. Our detailed analysis of ORIs responsible for heterochromatin replication has also implications on the mechanisms of ORI specification in other multicellular organisms in which retrotransposons are major components of heterochromatin as well as of the entire genome.",

    "abstract": "Bears are iconic mammals with a complex evolutionary history. Natural bear hybrids and studies of few nuclear genes indicate that gene flow among bears may be more common than expected and not limited to the closely related polar and brown bears. Here we present a genome analysis of the bear family with representatives of all living species. Phylogenomic analyses of 869 mega base pairs divided into 18,621 genome fragments yielded a well-resolved coalescent species tree despite signals for extensive gene flow across species. However, genome analyses using three different statistical methods show that gene flow is not limited to closely related species pairs. Strong ancestral gene flow between the Asiatic black bear and the ancestor to polar, brown and American black bear explains numerous uncertainties in reconstructing the bear phylogeny. Gene flow across the bear clade may be mediated by intermediate species such as the geographically wide-spread brown bears leading to massive amounts of phylogenetic conflict. Genome-scale analyses lead to a more complete understanding of complex evolutionary processes. The increasing evidence for extensive inter-specific gene flow, found also in other animal species, necessitates shifting the attention from speciation processes achieving genome-wide reproductive isolation to the selective processes that maintain species divergence in the face of gene flow.",

    "abstract": "Defining the contributions of dispersal, reproductive mode, and mating system to the population structure of a pathogenic organism is essential to estimating its evolutionary potential. After introduction of the devastating plant pathogen, Phytophthora capsici, into a growers field, a lack of aerial spore dispersal restricts migration. Once established, coexistence of both mating types results in formation of overwintering recombinant oospores, engendering persistent pathogen populations. To mimic these conditions, in 2008, we inoculated a field with two P. capsici isolates of opposite mating type. We analyzed pathogenic isolates collected in 2009-13 from this experimental population, using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. By tracking heterozygosity across years, we show that the population underwent a generational shift; transitioning from exclusively F1 in 2009-10; mixed generational in 2011; and ultimately all inbred in 2012-13. Survival of F1 oospores, characterized by heterozygosity excess, coupled with a low rate of selfing, delayed declines in heterozygosity due to inbreeding and attainment of equilibrium genotypic frequencies. Large allele and haplotype frequency changes in specific genomic regions accompanied the generational shift, representing putative signatures of selection. Finally, we identified an approximately 1.6 Mb region associated with mating type determination, constituting the first detailed genomic analysis of a mating type region (MTR) in Phytophthora. Segregation patterns in the MTR exhibited tropes of sex-linkage, where maintenance of allele frequency differences between isolates of opposite mating type was associated with elevated heterozygosity despite inbreeding. Characterizing the trajectory of this experimental system provides key insights into the processes driving persistent, sexual pathogen populations.",

    "abstract": "Long-range inter-chromosomal interactions in the interphase nucleus subsume critical genome-level regulatory functions such as transcription and gene expression. To decipher the physical basis of diverse pan-nuclear patterns of chromosomal arrangement that facilitates these processes, we investigate the scaling effects within disparate genomes and compared their total number of genes with chromosome size. First, we derived the pan-nuclear average fractal dimension of inter-chromosomal arrangement in interphase nuclei of different species and corroborated our predictions with independently reported results. Then, we described the different patterns across disparate unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes. We report that, unicellular lower eukaryotes have inter-chromosomal fractal dimension = 1 at the pan-nuclear scales, which is analogous to the multi-polymer crumpled globule model. Multi-fractal dimensions, corresponding to different inter-chromosomal arrangements emerged from multicellular eukaryotes, such that closely related species have relatively similar patterns. Using this theoretical approach, we could distinguish fractal patterns from human acrocentric versus metacentric chromosomes, implying that the multi-fractal nature of inter-chromosomal geometry facilitates viable large-scale chromosomal aberrations, such as Robertsonian translocations. We report that the nature of such an average multi-fractal dimension for nocturnal mammals is very different in diurnal mammals, which suggests a greatly enhanced plasticity in arrangement across different cell types, for example retinal versus dermal fibroblasts. Altogether, our results substantiate that genome-level constraints have also co-evolved with the average pan-nuclear fractal dimension of inter-chromosomal folding during eukaryotic evolution.",

    "abstract": "Heritable variation in gene expression patterns plays a fundamental role in trait variation and evolution, making understanding the mechanisms by which genetic variation acts on gene expression patterns a major goal for biology. Both theoretical and empirical work have largely focused on variation in steady-state mRNA levels and mRNA synthesis rates, particularly of protein-coding genes. Yet in order for this variation to affect higher order traits it must lead to differences at the protein level. Variation in protein-specific processes including protein synthesis rates and protein decay rates could amplify, mask, or even reverse effects transmitted from the transcript level, but the extent to which this happens is unclear. Moreover, mechanisms that underlie protein expression variation under dynamic conditions have not been examined. To address this challenge, we analyzed how mRNA and protein expression dynamics covary between two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae during mating pheromone response. Although divergent steady-state mRNA expression levels explained divergent steady-state protein levels for four out of five genes in our study, the same was true for only one out of five genes for expression dynamics. By integrating decay rate and allele-specific protein expression analyses, we resolved that expression divergence for Fig1p was caused by genetic variation acting in trans on protein synthesis rate, expression divergence for Ina1p was caused by cis-by-trans epistatic effects on transcript level and protein synthesis rate, and expression divergence for Fus3p and Tos6p were caused by divergence in protein synthesis rates. Our study demonstrates that steady-state analysis of gene expression is insufficient to understand the impact of genetic variation on gene expression variation. An integrated and dynamic approach to gene expression analysis - comparing mRNA levels, protein levels, protein decay rates, and allele-specific protein expression - allows for a detailed analysis of the genetic mechanisms underlying protein expression divergences.",

    "abstract": "Tissue classification plays a crucial role in the investigation of normal neural development, brain-behavior relationships, and the disease mechanisms of many psychiatric and neurological illnesses. Ensuring the accuracy of tissue classification is important for quality research and, in particular, the translation of imaging biomarkers to clinical practice. Assessment with the human eye is vital to correct various errors inherent to all currently available segmentation algorithms. Manual quality assurance becomes methodologically difficult at a large scale - a problem of increasing importance as the number of data sets is on the rise. To make this process more efficient, we have developed Mindcontrol, an open-source web application for the collaborative quality control of neuroimaging processing outputs. The Mindcontrol platform consists of a dashboard to organize data, descriptive visualizations to explore the data, an imaging viewer, and an in-browser annotation and editing toolbox for data curation and quality control. Mindcontrol is flexible and can be configured for the outputs of any software package in any data organization structure. Example configurations for three large, open-source datasets are presented: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP), the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR), and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) Collection. These demo applications link descriptive quality control metrics, regional brain volumes, and thickness scalars to a 3D imaging viewer and editing module, resulting in an easy-to-implement quality control protocol that can be scaled for any size and complexity of study.",

Antigens were labelled simultaneously with a fluorescent dye coupled to a secondary antibody (Dye-Ab) and the Qdot-Ab.

Comparisons of our results with those of sea urchins and cnidarians suggest that foxQ2 has acquired functions in head and brain patterning during protostome evolution. Our findings expand the knowledge on foxQ2 gene function to include essential roles in epidermal development and central brain patterning.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe development of the anterior most part of any animal embryo - for instance the brain of vertebrates and the head of insects - depends on a very similar set of genes present in all animals. This is true for the two major lineages of bilaterian animals, the deuterostomes (including sea urchin and humans) and protostomes (including annelids and insects) and the cnidarians (e.g. the sea anemone), which are representatives of more ancient animals. However, the interaction of these genes has been studied in deuterostomes and cnidarians but not in protostomes. Here, we present the first study the function of the gene foxQ2 in protostomes. We found that the gene acts at the top level of the genetic network and when its function is knocked down, the labrum (a part of the head) and higher order brain centers do not develop. This is in contrast to the other animal groups where foxQ2 appears to play a less central role. We conclude that foxQ2 has acquired additional functions in the course of evolution of protostomes.",

We show that the coexistence phase in which both strategies for each group are present is stable because of an effective, cyclic dominance behavior similar to a well studied generalizations of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game with four species (without neutral pairs), a further example of how ubiquitous this mechanism is. In addition, inside the coexistence phase (but interestingly, only for finite size systems) there is a realization of the survival of the weakest effect that is triggered by a percolation crossover.",

By reducing membrane resistance upon depolarisation they convert the cheap, low bandwidth membrane needed in dim light to the expensive high bandwidth membrane needed in bright light. This investment of energy in bandwidth according to functional requirements can halve daily energy consumption. Second, DRs produce negative feedback that reduces membrane impedance and increases bandwidth. This negative feedback allows an active membrane with DRs to consume at least 30% less energy than a passive membrane with the same capacitance and bandwidth. Voltage gated conductances in other non-spiking neurons, and in dendrites, might be organized to make similar savings.",

    "abstract": "Structural covariance examines covariation of grey matter morphology between brain regions and across individuals. Despite significant interest in the influence of age on structural covariance patterns, no study to date has provided a complete lifespan perspective--bridging childhood with early, middle, and late adulthood--on the development of structural covariance networks. Here, we investigate the lifespan trajectories of structural covariance in six canonical neurocognitive networks: default, dorsal attention, frontoparietal control, somatomotor, ventral attention, and visual. By combining data from five open access data sources, we examine the structural covariance trajectories of these networks from 6-94 years of age in a sample of 1580 participants. Using partial least squares, we show that structural covariance patterns across the lifespan exhibit two significant, age-dependent trends. The first trend is a stable pattern whose integrity declines over the lifespan. The second trend is an inverted-U that differentiates young adulthood from other age groups. Hub regions, including posterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula, appear particularly influential in the expression of this second age-dependent trend. Overall, our results suggest that structural covariance provides a reliable definition of neurocognitive networks across the lifespan and reveal both shared and network-specific trajectories.",

    "abstract": "When a decision is made based on a series of samples of evidence, the threshold for decision may change over time. Here we propose a fast heuristic algorithm that estimates the time-varying thresholds without making an assumption on their shape. The algorithm gives an approximate best estimate of the time-varying thresholds for all time considered when all other parameters are fixed. The algorithm outperforms conventional methods that gradually adjust the threshold estimates during fitting, when fitting time is limited.",
