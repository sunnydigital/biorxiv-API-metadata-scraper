    "abstract": "Like a moth into the flame - Phototaxis is an iconic example for innate preferences. Such preferences likely reflect evolutionary adaptations to predictable situations and have traditionally been conceptualized as hard-wired stimulus-response links. Perhaps therefore, the century-old discovery of flexibility in Drosophila phototaxis has received little attention. Here we report that across several different behavioral tests, light/dark preference tested in walking is dependent on various aspects of flight. If we temporarily compromise flying ability, walking photopreference reverses concomitantly. Neuronal activity in circuits expressing dopamine and octopamine, respectively, plays a differential role in photopreference, suggesting a potential involvement of these biogenic amines in this case of behavioral flexibility. We conclude that flies monitor their ability to fly, and that flying ability exerts a fundamental effect on action selection in Drosophila. This work suggests that even behaviors which appear simple and hard-wired comprise a value-driven decision-making stage, negotiating the external situation with the animals internal state, before an action is selected.",

    "abstract": "Many common diseases show wide phenotypic variation. We present a statistical method for determining whether phenotypically defined subgroups of disease cases represent different genetic architectures, in which disease-associated variants have different effect sizes in the two subgroups. Our method models the genome-wide distributions of genetic association statistics with mixture Gaussians. We apply a global test without requiring explicit identification of disease-associated variants, thus maximising power in comparison to a standard variant by variant subgroup analysis. Where evidence for genetic subgrouping is found, we present methods for post-hoc identification of the contributing genetic variants.\\n\\nWe demonstrate the method on a range of simulated and test datasets where expected results are already known. We investigate subgroups of type 1 diabetes (T1D) cases defined by autoantibody positivity, establishing evidence for differential genetic architecture with thyroid peroxidase antibody positivity, driven generally by variants in known T1D associated regions.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of genome-wide association studies are performed in Europeans, and their transferability to other populations is dependent on many factors (e.g. linkage disequilibrium, allele frequencies, genetic architecture). As medical genomics studies become increasingly large and diverse, gaining insights into population history and consequently the transferability of disease risk measurement is critical. Here, we disentangle recent population history in the widely-used 1000 Genomes Project reference panel, with an emphasis on populations underrepresented in medical studies. To examine the transferability of single-ancestry GWAS, we used published summary statistics to calculate polygenic risk scores for six well-studied traits and diseases. We identified directional inconsistencies in all scores; for example, height is predicted to decrease with genetic distance from Europeans, despite robust anthropological evidence that West Africans are as tall as Europeans on average. To gain deeper quantitative insights into GWAS transferability, we developed a complex trait coalescent-based simulation framework considering effects of polygenicity, causal allele frequency divergence, and heritability. As expected, correlations between true and inferred risk were typically highest in the population from which summary statistics were derived. We demonstrated that scores inferred from European GWAS were biased by genetic drift in other populations even when choosing the same causal variants, and that biases in any direction were possible and unpredictable. This work cautions that summarizing findings from large-scale GWAS may have limited portability to other populations using standard approaches, and highlights the need for generalized risk prediction methods and the inclusion of more diverse individuals in medical genomics.",

    "abstract": "Cell growth and division are processes vital to the proliferation and development of life. Coordination between these two processes has been recognized for decades in a variety of organisms. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this coordination or  size control appears as an inverse correlation between cell size and the rate of cell-cycle progression, routinely observed in G1 prior to cell division commitment. Beyond this point, cells are presumed to complete S/G2/M at similar rates and in a size-independent manner. As such, studies of dependence between growth and division have focused on G1. Moreover, coordination between growth and division has commonly been analyzed within the cycle of a single cell without accounting for correlations in growth and division characteristics between cycles of related cells. In a comprehensive analysis of three published time-lapse microscopy datasets, we analyze both intra-and inter-cycle dependencies between growth and division, revisiting assumptions about the coordination between these two processes. Interestingly, we find evidence (1) that S/G2/M durations are systematically longer in daughters than in mothers, (2) of dependencies between S/G2/M and size at budding that echo the classical G1 dependencies, and, (3) in contrast with recent bacterial studies, of negative dependencies between size at birth and size accumulated during the cell cycle. In addition, we develop a novel hierarchical model to uncover inter-cycle dependencies, and we find evidence for such dependencies in cells growing in sugar-poor environments. Our analysis highlights the need for experimentalists and modelers to account for new sources of cell-to-cell variation in growth and division, and our model provides a formal statistical framework for the continued study of dependencies between biological processes.",

    "abstract": "Histone modifications alone or in combination are thought to modulate chromatin structure and function; a concept termed histone code. By combining evidence from several studies, we investigated if the histone code can play a role in higher-order folding of chromatin. Firstly using genomic data, we analyzed associations between histone modifications at the nucleosome level. We could dissect the composition of individual nucleosomes into five predicted clusters of histone modifications. Secondly, by assembling the raw reads of histone modifications at various length scales, we noticed that the histone mark relationships that exist at nucleosome level tend to be maintained at the higher orders of chromatin folding. Recently, a high-resolution imaging study showed that histone marks belonging to three of the five predicted clusters show structurally distinct and anti-correlated chromatin domains at the level of chromosomes. This made us think that the histone code can have a significant impact in the overall compaction of DNA: at the level of nucleosomes, at the level of genes, and finally at the level of chromosomes. As a result, in this article, we put forward a theory where the histone code drives not only the functionality but also the higher-order folding and compaction of chromatin.",

Mainly, we share our experience gained while creating the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network. In the step-by-step procedure, we describe the map construction process and suggest solutions for map complexity management by introducing a hierarchical modular map structure. In addition, we describe the NaviCell platform, a computational technology using Google Maps API to explore comprehensive molecular maps similar to geographical maps, and explain the advantages of semantic zooming principles for map navigation. We also provide the outline to prepare signalling network maps for navigation using the NaviCell platform. Finally, several examples of cancer high-throughput data analysis and visualization in the context of comprehensive signalling maps are presented.",

    "abstract": "Access to primary research data is vital for the advancement of science. To extend the data types supported by community repositories, we built a prototype Image Data Resource (IDR) that collects and integrates imaging data acquired across many different imaging modalities. IDR links high-content screening, super-resolution microscopy, time-lapse and digital pathology imaging experiments to public genetic or chemical databases, and to cell and tissue phenotypes expressed using controlled ontologies. Using this integration, IDR facilitates the analysis of gene networks and reveals functional interactions that are inaccessible to individual studies. To enable re-analysis, we also established a computational resource based on IPython notebooks that allows remote access to the entire IDR. IDR is also an open source platform that others can use to publish their own image data. Thus IDR provides both a novel on-line resource and a software infrastructure that promotes and extends publication and re-analysis of scientific image data.",

    "abstract": "The identification of cell type marker genes, genes highly enriched in specific cell types, plays an important role in the study of the nervous system. In particular, marker genes can be used to identify cell types to enable studies of their properties. Marker genes can also aid the interpretation of bulk tissue expression profiles by revealing cell type specific changes.\\n\\nWe assembled a database, NeuroExpresso, of publicly available mouse brain cell type-specific gene expression datasets. We then used stringent criteria to select marker genes highly expressed in individual cell types. We found a substantial number of novel markers previously unknown in the literature and validated a subset of them using in silico analyses and in situ hybridization. We next demonstrate the use of marker genes in analysis of whole tissue data by summarizing their expression into \\\"cell type profiles\\\" that can be thought of as surrogates for the relative abundance of the cell types across the samples studied.\\n\\nFurther analysis of our cell type-specific expression database confirms some recent findings about brain cell types along with revealing novel properties, such as Ddc expression in oligodendrocytes. To facilitate further use of this expanding database, we provide a user-friendly web interface for the visualization of expression data.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCell type markers are powerful tools in the study of the nervous system that help reveal properties of cell types and acquire additional information from large scale expression experiments. Despite their usefulness in the field, known marker genes for brain cell types are few in number. We present NeuroExpresso, a database of brain cell type specific gene expression profiles, and demonstrate the use of marker genes for acquiring cell type specific information from whole tissue expression. The database will prove itself as a useful resource for researchers aiming to reveal novel properties of the cell types and aid both laboratory and computational scientists to unravel the cell type specific components of brain disorders.",

    "abstract": "Bone metastases are a source of intractable pain, resistant to conventional opioid and non-opioid analgesics. The neurotensin system represents a potential pathway toward bone cancer pain (BCP) relieve via the inhibition of its receptors NTS1 and NTS2. Capitalizing on our recent results using neurotensin analogs in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models, we here show, for the first time, a potential role for neurotensin receptors agonists in the treatment of BCP. The novel non-selective agonist JMV-2009 (300 g/kg) reversed mechanical allodynia in our rodent BCP model at both early and late stages of the disease. The NTS2-selective agonist JMV-431 (90 g/kg), in addition to anti-allodynia, also had an effect on weight bearing deficits. In parallel, we tested proven analgesics from several classes to put the effect of neurotensin analogs in perspective and found that morphine (3 mg/kg), tramadol (15 mg/kg) and amitriptyline (10 mg/kg) had mild effects on BCP while the cannabinoid nabilone (1 mg/kg) significantly reversed both allodynia and weight bearing deficits. Taken together, our results affirm the potential of the modulation of the neurotensin system for the development of new analgesics for the treatment of bone cancer pain.",
